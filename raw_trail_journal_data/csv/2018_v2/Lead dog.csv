Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/228069,"The weatherman sure mixed his days up forecasting this weekend. It was supposed to rain on the way in and then become sunny on Sunday. Well NOT.. the rains rolled in overnight but it couldn't dampen our party at the punchbowl. We were serenaded by the peep fogs from the pond and to the pop pop pop of rain on our tents. Noni and I hit the trail at US 60 early Saturday morning expecting to walk in the rain but quickly pulled the coats off with the humidity cooking us. Heck Lead Dog had to call for mercy first shedding my full pack and rain coat on the down hill descent. Sandra would be proud! The trail was like a boulevard, wide and flat, leading us down to Brown Town. This area was used back in the day by sharecroppers and slave help. The Brown's owned this whole bottom land along the creek. The forest service has placed signs along the way telling us the story just like walking back in time. Rows of rock walled off sections of land and remnants of buildings were still standing. Brown shelter which we passed at the 2 mile mark looked like an inviting spot to camp with the creek running right below and plenty of tent spots off to the side. Making good time we met several hikers, a couple from Lexington out day tripping..easy now none of that on the trail. We also met two gents out for month of April. They had hiked the AT in '06 and knew the meaning of clocking miles and wanted to give a go at taking their time. They had quite the big packs and questioned our packs. I was the 'butch' girl loaded with a full pack and then there's Miss Noni carrying this liiitle bitty pack with the 'kitchen' as they put it. ""No you can't sleep in my tent, and no you can't come in my sleeping bag if Denny doesn't show up!"" Watch out for that snake that might sneak in!!!!We had lunch at the reservoir by the big bridge kicking off our boots to rest the tootsies. Wonder where Denny is about now? He's supposed to come in off the parkway and meet us a few miles from our finish. Well it's all up hill from here so we bet he ain't coming down to darn far. We have 4 miles to go having already hike 7 in about 3 hours. At a girl little Dotson! I was proud of my hiking companion not having hiked in a month and was out here runnin' with Lead Dog and keeping right with me.Each step was starting to take it's toll about now. Mile after mile of white blazes leading to the punchbowl. ""I'm Hot, I'm sweatin now!"" Noni's face gets a brighter shade of red each time I turn to check her progress as I myself catch my breath. We have one thing to look forward to, well two, the top of this mountain and the prize at the finish a good cold drink. ""Denny Wayne had better be there!"" A bright orange shirt appears up ahead it's the Greyhound watching. The car can't be but 2 miles away.11 miles trekked, two brews down and 1/2 mile to go. Wew I'm glad, ready for a rest. The dynamic duo spar a few times while switching out the day packs for big packs. We hike in. Camp fire fun begins before we even get started. Peep frogs peep and Noni sings as I set up my tent. Denny elects for shelter sleeping so Noni makes their bed. A section hiker comes in before dark and stays with us. Darkness falls and the fire flickers and a shadow appears. It's Handsome Harry aka Coon Eyes. He's made it in empty handed I might add. Where's the Bud's?We hope is new trail name shall be short lived. He's had some 'work' done to remedy skin cancer and the doc laid the acid to him. OUCH! We crack off stories and hiking adventures amongst ourselves and our new hiking friend and invite him to join us for more trail fun down road. The head lights go out as the fire dwindles.What's that? Rain! Sure hope my tent is water tight! Is that a stream I hear running around me? Peep Peep Peep. Pop Pop Pop. Morning. Damp. Drip Drip. Where's that sun? Heck where's the shelter? We break camp and ring out the tents and part the fog as we head out of the woods.","

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/228065,"There's only one word to describe this weekend's hike....SimplySummertimeStrollin!!! Well almost one word. The birds tweeted, the sun came out and the skies cleared to bright blue. The hike was not only breath taking but the drive thru the valley was as well. We began our hike at O'Lystery's picnic shelter off 42 walking south to Groseclose and the Interstate. Our Bland gal, Trail Whisperer joined us and brought he little dog, Ganu. She, Ganu, was quite an energetic pup hopping from person to person trying to figure out just who we were. Nikon never minded the new trail companion of which he could have tucked in his pack with room to spare. Captain quickly sets our pace by trying to catch a Boy Scout troop we hear is just up ahead of us. The woods thin and the Big Valley opens wide as we trek out in the fields. Wow what a view. Pristine green fields rolling for miles. The scouts look like little specs down below us. They are from Bristol and are completing one of their 7 hikes to BE All they can BE. A few have dropped out at the 2 mile mark but the rest are bound for in the interstate as we. Thru hikers are many today with us meeting a good handle full. Georgia, Tenn. New Hampshire, ages from 20 to 60 I'd say and all men. You missed them Noni!!! We even managed to pick up another trail dog we named Maggie. She must have been a local mute used to joining hikers because she seemed right at home tagging along. Not to worry she rode back with us to her 'home' near 42. The several miles of puds start to wear on us especially once lunch time rolled around and past. ""Man I'm starving, where's that shelter anyway?"" Wow we've walked 9 miles already and it's just a bit after 1:00. No wonder we're ready to refuel. The shelter sets right on the trail with smoke still coming from a fire left this morning. We scarf down our food and rest our legs. We talk trail gear and upcoming events and that we only have 2.5 to go. Yeee Hawww. Trail Whisperer does her trail duty and clears trash along our last few miles. We hear the interstate coming over our last open field. The reality of coming back into the 'real' world has hit.","

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/227947,"The beauty of the garden just can't be put into words folks but I'll try. I'm standing on the edge of her rim looking out above the tree tops to the vibrant green pastures. Barns, silage stacks and farm houses dot the valley's floor. High cotton clouds let the sun cast its shadows onto the mountain sides. Just breathe taking.Some doubt had been cast early this morning as to the chance of a rain out. Should we stay or should we go? Glad we went!!! Trailwhisper's hubby Keith provided the shuttle service for us allowing a thru hike from one route to another for a total of 10.8 miles. Yes our little hiker Braveheart has once again notched another mile stone to his upcoming 4-H speech. With a hop, skip and a tumble or two he has hiked his longest distance to date.He and mom set a blistering pace once let out of the gates for our up hill challenge to Chestnut knob. The two trail 'experts' are quick to note they shall blow out soon enough once THE fields are reached. Ah the fields. Grassy balds from year's past, cleared for a plantation's orchards and farm land. Wow now this would be a fine view to wake up to every morning. The shelter stands atop the last knoll just on the edge of Burke's Garden, stone and stout to bear the harsh winds that always are blowing up here. Ian is quick to find a Noni rock and name one for his own. Having lunch in the shelter sure brought back stories from our overnight here some few year's ago. A departing group shot and some privy shenanigans and we are off.Pud after pud we go along. ""How much farther Lead Dog?"" ""What time will we finish?"" False summits are at every turn which takes a toll about the double digit mark. The troops quiten, just the shuffling of our feet in the leaves and the sticks clicking along the rocks to be heard. Even Nikon has come to a stroll up in front. Ganu, well Ganu is like a fire ant in a hot skillet, popping all the time!We take in the last chance overlook before our finish, a vast and wide view over the garden from a side angel. A storm is just coming over the outer rim on the north side. We have missed the rains and thankful for the sun we have received today. Sure hope Keith is out there waiting on us. A 3:00 train arrival was specified. Speaking of trains we hunted for one or at least the railroad tracks it ran on. Our 'conductor' and his little caboose scanned a section just off our road home. ""Dig here Dad, dig here!"" Thanks again to Keith for our shuttle and after trail adventure!","Forest rd hiking 10.8 miles

Myself and a hiking buddy 'The Captain' have been hiking each weekend to prepare for our daily mileage for our week long adventure. Doing overnights about once a month helped us whittle down the pack weight as well. Last year left us off at Deep Gap Rd 71 outside of Franklin so we shall pick up from here and hike to Springer this year. We leave this weekend!!!","

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/230790,"Springer Bound 2008 Cowart Gap                                        05/04/08 6:41PM“We made it today, we’ll make it tomorrow” Captain says as the sun goes down at Cowart Gap. Miles hiked today 15 – Time left 7AM – Time arrived 3PMEarly to bed means early to rise that was the theme this morning. We had to catch our shuttle at 6AM. Yes 6AM but made a great difference in how the hike played out.The woods ARE truly alive at this time of the day. Flowers scattered the hillside. Trillium, Bluets, May Apple. Birds darted from tree to tree – the morning sun rises above the mountains casting beams thru the trees. Yes the woods are alive.Our first climb helps us see Standing Indian. A mountain we camped on last season-our highest point of the day 4700 feet. The map indicated a lot of PUDS, some larger that others but the trail led us mostly to the sides and around the peaks, cool! But what a day of down, down, down. One section was an hour of it. My feet screamed for relief. Glad Captain has his new knee brace. He’s trying out this device used by the VT football players and seeing if it CAN handle 90 miles of the AT! We’ll see. We meet several thru-hikers heading north. One guy reminded me of my cousin Glen who would resemble the Uncle Jesse type from the Dukes of Hazzard. He had hands full of jewelry, one ring on each finger so we called him Liberache. He looked a tad buzzed too!! Ha ha Then there was the mom and daughter combo, Blue and Crazy Feet. Oriental duo hiking “this trail” all the way as mom put it. The little gal was 11 years old carrying her own pack and gear of 14 pounds. Bright eyed and ready to go after cooling down at the spring. Bly Gap was the highlight of today for me, the knarled up tree standing along the gap just this side of the Georgia Line. Oh yeah we made GA by 10:15 this morning. Making good time we press on to a shelter for lunch and water-PlumOrchard. A really cool designed shelter placed by the forest service with the help of the military. Barn looking style with corner glass for star gazing from the upper deck. 11 miles clocked. A young NOBO (north bounder) was impressed with the average miles we intend to do. Also passing or should I say meeting other trekkers, I laugh that they probably think why is this white haired man (notice I didn’t say old) walking with this young chick AND she’s carrying all the gear? See our packs look quite different – Box on one’s back and a head thumping pack on the other. Yep he’s got Her trained! Cap started with 23 and I topped out at 27. Actually not bad.So here we are at Cowart Gap – our first night in GA. Tall pines surround us as well as poison ivy and VA Creeper. By the way which IS which?Supper has been downed-clean up was easy-bird bath in that same pot used for cooking. Hey I boiled the water all the germs are gone! The snoring – well purring has started from my hiking companions tent and I know it ain’t Nikon. We miss him. And what time is it? Try 7:06! I shall not be too far behind.","Rt. 71 Deep Gap South of Standing Indian

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/230792,"Tray Mountain Shelter                                        05/05/08 8:06PMThe hotel was just about full. Every camp spot up here has been booked. Captain and I are tucked under a twisted laurel tree with just a short distance from ‘the prime spot’. An outcropping of rock with a vast view over the GA mountains. A record has just been set between us for tent farting. The competition began last night but the record to beat has just been sounded out and I need not say who is in the lead. It sure seems to crank up just after supper time. “Be careful what you wish for” was the quote for today. Wishing for some up to relieve the wobbly legs – Well we go it. Now the heels are pretty sore. “No other way to get there but walk” Captain points out at one of our resting stops.We got another early start both of us up at 6AM. Hit the trail at 7:45. Perfect! 12 miles to go and it’s gonna be another warm day. Violets marked the path early along with a flower similar to a trillium but with a bigger center colored burgundy set on large leaves. Come to find out it’s a toad stand trillium. Once past Dick’s Creek it was all up hill. Step after step- temps getting warmer and warmer. Wow, who turned on the oven? We meet a few NOBO’s but not as many as yesterday. There were also some folks being dropped off by hostel shuttles too.The trail in GA is like the beginning of any trail- wide path fairly smooth and beaten down. Sorta wish I had brought my ruby slippers to try. We take an early lunch break water is needed and since we are going off the trail a bit why not. We kick off the shoes and warm like snakes in the grass beside the shelter at Deep Gap. Kelly Knob awaits us. One of the first Big climbs the NOBO’s talk about. Glad we are going up the short side. What..who said that? It was a doozie and hard coming down the other side too. We rest at Addis Gap and talk with a lad from Pittsburgh hoping to finish in August. He’s trying to do 20 mile days. Seemed fairly experienced and said he dreamed of hiking the AT since age 10. Trail name was Grandpa Joe because he was the last to leave the supper table at home. 5 miles to go. I’ll see ya at the shelter Captain. He says not to wait on him. He knows with the steady climbs I will be to hard to keep up with. “Where is this Tray Mtn Shelter anyway?” Sweat drips from my nose. Almost at the tippy top. Salt has crusted on my face from the heat. Pee Uuu, I have the thru-hiker aroma now. Hope the water source is good. I could just lay right down in a good cold creek about now. It will be dark soon. 8:33 now. Everyone up here is quite. We should have a nice sunrise in the morning being up here on the ridge. We had a good sunset so why not. One thing is for certain high mileage equates to longer hours need for sleep. My eyes grow weary and so is the body. Turn out the lights John Boy.","Cowart Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/230929,"Low Gap Campsite                                                05-06-08 8:47PMWhat a day!!! Sunrise this morning from Tray Mtn-YES-NIIICE. Up a 6AM and Gone by 7:45AM makes for hiking in less heat. 80 some degrees today. I had to patch up a heel with moleskin and duck tape. Yes duck tape. The all purpose trail tool. Worked too. I might have to do both tomorrow. I’m in no real pain but skin keeps rolling off and soon enough would be in the quick. Captain has been pretty much up with me so far, only the hills separate us. He catches me on the flat terrain which has been few and far between today. Two 1000 foot climbs right off the bat. Rocky Knob and Blue Mountain both wore us down. The Gap between the two made a good resting stop to literally get our legs back under us.Once up Ol Blue-which I think got its name because every step I looked up and saw the blue sky and those white marks leading endlessly to the skies. I came into its shelter some 30 minutes before Captain and 4 fellas were resting up and doing laundry. One, a military guy, who had rode across America on a bicycle tour last year. Tattoo guy was out for his first long hiking trip with another older gent whose feet were in terrible shape. We talked about the AT, where we had previously hiked, and where we destined this week. Once Captain arrived and was rested we took off for Low Gap.We saw signs of wild hogs along the sides of the trail. They had rooted and rolled in side hill springs. A hiker says a few past before him this morning. Yikes! Do I run? Drop and play dead? Captain says climb a tree. Yeah right, with this pack?!Actually our packs are getting lighter now. Breakfast is all that is left in the feed sack. Neels Gap will be our lunch stop and resupply tomorrow.I have to say today was hard after we hit the big hills this morning and then finished with several miles of winding logging road that never seemed to end. 15 miles seemed like 20. “Where’s the end of this blessed trail?” we rumbled. We walked on pure will power coming into camp at 6:30. We cleaned, grubbed, talked with a few NOBO’s and crashed in our tents. A night bird calls us to sleep.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/230794,"Neels Gap                                                05-07-08 1:45PMKey words time. I’ve decided it best to jot down some phrases mid-day so I can write my story better tonight.Woods Hole Shelter                                                        8:37PMWe are camping at the shelter dedicated to Miss Tilly Woods, a lady from our own back yard in Pearisburg who fed thru-hikers for years. The first time I met her she talked about the time she boarded the original thru-hiker, Earl Shaffer. This shelter sets ½ mile off the trail and sleeps about 6 tightly. There are 3 newbies here resting. Blisters blisters every where. 2 guys and a gal that started their trek to Maine at the same time. This seems to be how most relationships are started, groups form at Springer’s start and some remain for the entire trip. Now lets go back to yesterday for a moment- precamp arrival to Low Gap. Long Long walk to reach the shelter by forest road. We had to camel water into camp so we did it ‘Captain style’. Fill up the water bag and slide our hiking sticks thru the handles so no one carries all the load. Tired pups we were. Quick to bed we were. Lead Dog turns out her lamp and then the mind turns on.That story from the hiker about the wild boars races thru my mind. Are they out there? Let me tell ya them hogs worked the hill just over the ridge from our tents all damn night. I thought if they get Captain, see he’s closer to the ridge than I, I’ll have time to get way while they eat him first. Rustle rustle, snap snap, grunt grunt. I heard them, honest I did, from 9pm to 3am. 5:00AM arrives-ding dong time to get up. Our tents illuminate the forest. Yes we decided to make an extra early start to beat the heat once again and have plenty of time to tarry at Neels Gap. Head lights on “and we’re off to see the wizard!” But what’s that? I stop and move behind a tree. Eyes are looking at me, a dark mass. It’s them damn hogs!!! They’re gonna eat me! Captain gets a big laugh as we move on trying to figure out just what I did see. Leaving early we waited to have breakfast. Sunrise from a ridge while the oats are cooking was awesome. And we have already walked 2 miles, 11 more to Neels.We run across many gals today so I proclaimed it Ladies Day. Young and older, some alone or with a new found friend. Then there’s the 3 boys I called the camouflage crew who have been sorta along with us thus far. Green horns out having a ball. They didn’t think this ole gal would keep up with them stating they’d see me at the Gap. Well one water stop by them opened the door. Steady along Lead Dog goes. They do get back into shouting distance but I pull away on the last turn up. I see Neels Gap road at 1:00. Finally! Where’s the store? How much more will I endure? My feet ache. Hotdogs, pizza, get your cold _______ NOT brew but soda. I should say sodas, Captain. Another airplane goes over. Wonder if it’s Harry coming in for a landing. Blood Mountain looms next. Sounds bad don’t it? Well it was and like none other I’ve climbed before. Was like 3 trails into one. The rocks like Rock Castle Gorge except more, the technical like Dragon’s Tooth, and the steepness of Stechoa. 1500 Feet ALL UP. There stands the shelter made of thousands of rocks placed one upon another to form a stone house with a chimney. It was cold inside believe it or not with temps now at 80 outside. A cold cold place I’m sure in the winter.It’s getting close to 5:00 and we are making our way to a campsite (Slaughter creek)….we think. How far is the damn water? Too far to haul back so we press on for Woods Hole and why not visit Miss Tilly’s name sake.We once again get water Captain style and hike it in a few 100 yards or so. Same old song and dance, set up tents, bathe, grub and go to bed.Gooch Mountain is tomorrow – 12 miles a piece of cake.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Time enough to scope out the tent spots and decide not to go that route. Rains are coming. Ah also time for a shower ha ha and claim my/our bunk spots in the shelter. Captain rolls in 4:15. And so do 8 others. Glad this is a double decker house. We got to another early start this morning 6AM and boy did I sleep good. Only a screech owl and Captain’s midnight thunder was heard. We said good bye to the newbies and wished them well. The trail is quite easy for a few miles and the forest is lush green. One hill has ferns galore and the next wild geraniums pinks and purples. Then what do I spot? A BEAR!! Yes he is just 40 yards down below us. He heard us before we saw him. I try to get my camera but spook and he is gone. Some puds put distance between Captain and myself and my mind wanders. This poplar stand of trees surrounding me reminds me of cool spring mornings up at my granny’s farm. Some how the miles don’t matter, it’s the enjoyment of the day out here. Yes the day’s end is hard – feet hurt- you’re hot and sticky and stinky. Fingernails dirty, you smell yourself and hope no one else does. You have a bad hair day everyday. But it doesn’t matter. You are soaking up the day. I am hoping for a creek today. I wanna soak my feet…ahh yes cool water rushing between my toes. Never mind my back side needs a washin!The Georgia terrain turns Virginia on me. Yes I am cooking today running at 2 miles an hour. Legs pumping. Lead dog is gone!! Captain has been keeping up with the switchback count. Now at 130 some and we still have 27 miles to go till Springer. When we get separated the first thing I think about is not will an animal get me or a crazy person but will the water source be good at the next stop. He is carrying our water filter. Most of the springs have been good, no need to filter. We just use his piece of PVC pipe and let it run into our canisters. Humm Lead dog brainstorms for a similar device she might have in her pack. Think ladies, what’s the one supply you’ll carry that a guy can’t use?Just pop out the filling, extend the plastic case and voila you have a pipe. It’s doesn’t filter ha ha but makes a nice spickit for water into your bottle. Trail Gal style.Some other trail facts, the shitters are full. Too many hikers before us. The last two I visited I was scared to drop the load for fear of clearance. Captain didn’t EVEN take his chances being a MAN and all. We hear the maintenance crews come and tamp the shit down. Boy I’d hate to be that unlucky sole. The rain has started now 7:08. Expecting hard rain all night. 2 more hikers have just arrived. Wet, Young, Tired. Blisters after just 2 day out. The inn is really packed. Somebody just might be sleeping on the picnic table before it’s all over. We have 15 miles tomorrow. Some hard climbs and then…Springer.

I’m setting on a log at this gap taking in the sunshine. Cool morning after the rain last night. We are over the half way mark today. Only 7 ½ miles to Springer.Back to last night before the BIG rains came. Captain and I laid out our bags, ate supper and waited to see what the others were gonna do. A couple of greenhorns and a few fellow campers are preparing their food with a pocket rocket. If you’ve never heard one fired up and runnin wide open just imagine a Hot Rod Funny Car powered by a jet. Flames blastin from her- Stand Back!!!Ol’wounded knee aka Captain rested his leg from where his brace has rubbed a sore, ouch. My new name for the night was Grey Goose. You can figure that one out yourself, hey? I mark that flask ya know and I’ll notice if you have par-took during the night. Darkness fell and the rain steadily comes down. We squeeze in the couple who arrives at dusk beside us. Rustle Rustle. Man the noise echos in this board house. They all roll over and one fell out – no wait – they all roll over and 3 more show up. It’s the boys, yep the camo crew. So the picnic table becomes their bed. One on top, one under, and one beside. The crowd makes sleeping only a dream. The mist rolls thru the shelter. I hunker down in my sleeping bag and pray for morning. An early rise and pack in the dark. Only our lamps casting shadows around in the shelter’s corner. An older couple whom we realize was dropped off at Dick’s Gap some few days ago is here with us. We name them Persnickety and Yes Dear. There are bound for Springer too. We walk out as they are stirring for the morning. They started in March from the James River and are covering this south section clocking 15-18 mile days. Impressive at age 68 and 61. “We’re off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of Oz.” Seems to be our theme song each morning.The rains have left a cool morning. Great for the climbing we have ahead of us. 3 biggies right off the bat but much like our hills at home. We have been above tree line for the past several days however the views are not really vast. Today and yesterday we can see more homes and a few valleys but not wide open fields like we are used to seeing. God casts the morning sunlight on our path. It illuminates the woods. Very peaceful.The sweat begins to pop up on my arms and nose. PUD after PUD we go. Captain and I are playing tag between road crossings. We want to come into Springer together and we don’t walk the same pace. So we set meeting points at road crossings. That’s why you have an update now on our progress instead all written tonight. 11:08 now- he should be coming in anytime and then we shall move on to our lunch stop.","Gooch Mtn Shelter

All other water sources have been mtn springs. Feet are coolin and head got wet. I’m at another road crossing awaiting Captain’s arrival.We had lunch at Hawks Mtn Shelter. We past a hiker who said 15 crammed in here to avoid the monsoon. Looks like a great camp spot. Shelter is nice and plenty of tent places all around and a good water source with a pipe. Only ½ mile from the road too. A good overnighter guys and we can ALL go to Springer just 8 miles away. Speaking of Springer I am 4 miles from the summit where I sit here at the forks. We called Captain’s daughter, Cindy and she was on her way to pick up Mack form school. So Little Mack Attack shall walk in with us between 4:00 and 5:00 this afternoon. We have wondered if Harry will pop in. One just never knows.This afternoon has been quite nice in the 70’s I’d say with a cool wind, blue skies with some scattered cotton clouds. No views off from here now- down in the bottom lands. Tall hemlocks and mountain laurel surround the trail which by the way co-insides with the Benton MacKaye Trail. BMT crossing the AT many times all the way to Springer. Flame azaleas, some as bright orange red that I’ve ever seen, dotted the path today. Wild columbine colored red, yellow, and orange just covered a rocky section off one ridge. Would have liked to take those for the flower bed at home.Captain has pulled in 2:45 – we will make our time to see his grandson – I’m just as excited as he is. 4 miles to Springer, did I tell ya that already? It’s clear and hot. Thank goodness for the tunnel of laurels for the first couple of miles. I wanna see out!!! I press to make the road where Mack should be waiting for us. Gotta make it. I thank the good Lord above for allowing me to make this journey. He seems to be with me right now for some reason. Guess it’s the solitude. The path turns more like trail, narrow and winding toward to top. Hootie Hoot I call out. Mack is perched on a rock looking for grandpa. “Don’t worry, he’ll be here in 30 minutes.” Look who’s pulling in, It’s Harry. Captain comes along and we down orange sodas and Pepsi’s. Oh and a wished for Moon Pie. At a boy Harry, way to come thru with what ‘really’ matters out here!!Mack leads the way up the 1 mile hike to Springer. I can’t wait to see out but wait where’s Captain? I can’t summit with out him. He has stopped by the shelter which is at the ½ mile mark. What? You can’t just stop before getting to the tippy top of the mountain we have walked all the distance to reach. Harry spots him coming around the last bend. He has dropped off his pack and sticks. THE blister has taken its toll on the Captain. All gimped up on the last big day, duck tape peaking out of this shoe. We step on the rock together. We have made it!!! We sign the notebook which is securely placed within the big rock bearing the summit sign.

Once we summited today we returned back down to the shelter and camping area. An old gentleman stepped out of his tent with notepad in hand. A radio station was playing quite loud. I thought he’s a rockin old timer, cool, Ranger Rick Rocks the House! He makes a note in his register that we have hiked either less or more than 6 miles to get here today. It might have been 10 miles either way Captain and I more than cleared the upper mark with a big 15. His trail name was Many Sleeps and he was 83 I think. Said his name came from his thru-hike and that he knew it would take him ‘many sleeps to reach Katahdin’. He instructs us where to find campsite, bear cables, shelter and 2 privies. There are loads of tents spots up here. I choose this one off from the shelter with a campfire ring and logs for seating. Look who’s here? The old couple we ran into at Dick’s Creek. Persnickety and Yes Dear. They come over to say hello and we congratulate each other. “Wonder where “the boys” are?” They had slept in after coming in last night from the rain at Gooch Shelter. We left way before they even turned over. Firewood is gathered while the sun starts to set. Captain scarfs down a sub Mack has packed in for Pa Pa. His first blister has him hobbled and he is very tired from pushing himself to make the scheduled time to pick up his grandson. “Medic Medic stop the pain!” he calls from his tent. The big ball of orange shines through the trees and fades. Mack Attack and Lead Dog watch the fire die down. Captain and Harry have turned in. The feeling of reaching Springer really hasn’t set in just yet. It will tomorrow, I’m sure, when I have that one last view off her before trekking down to the falls.","Three Forks-Meeting Mack-Springer Summit

Captain was up early prowling around at the wee hours of the morning. 4AM damn no wonder since he turned in at 7 last eve. I heard ‘someone-something’ outside my tent last night. “Who’s there I called?” no answer. Was it just the rabbit? Ha ha you laugh not THAT rabbit but the little guy we saw hopping from tent site to tent site looking for food. Twigs crack the fire has started back up, my tent fills with smoke. Someone IS out there. The Captain prowls.We break camp and hike our separate ways off Springer today. Harry and Captain are returning back down the mile to the parking lot Harry drove into. Cap’s foot just will not allow him to endure the Approach Trail off the other side. So Mack and I take the 8.8 mile blue trail off of here.Mack Attack set a hard pace for this gal today. Attacking every hill with head down and legs pumping to race to the top. Pure grit that boy’s got. He declared a challenge last night with the boys that no girl was gonna beat him off this mountain. I do believe he intends not to lose that bet. Our last look off Springer was foggy with just a tad bit of light trying to shine on us. I let Mack start our trek down to Amicalola Falls. I stand looking at the AT plaque I so long have anticipating seeing. The southern terminus portraying the first man, Earl Shaffer, who walked the entire AT. I read his words, A foot path for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness. Finally… it sets in, I am at Springer Mountain….I AM HERE!!I peak back over my shoulder seeing the last white blaze once more before taking up the blue and say I will be back. I will be back one day to hike from here to Maine. “Mack, wait for me!” He clicks along with Pa Pa Captain’s sticks. The woods brighten as the fog lifts. What a beautiful morning. Look out, Mack is down-twisted up like a pretzel. Sticks, pack, Mack all over the place. “Are you ok?” He shakes it off –wew- boy would I have some explaining to do if Lead Dog were to show up with a hurt grandson. We trek on.What a trooper this guys is. He loves the outdoors and appreciates nature around him stopping to take snapshots of birds and wildflowers along our way. “Ya know what gets me through Martha?” No what Mack? “TACO BELL!” How do ya like that? Taco Bell- now that’s hiker with his priorities straight.I can see how first time hikers might not even make it to the first white blaze. This blue trail is a hard up to Springer. Going down was tough on us. 4 big pulls going our direction and approximately 2000 feet of descent to reach the Falls starting blaze. And what is this a the top of the falls? 425 steps to the bottom. A sign warns of strenuousness and difficulty. No shit, my legs are shot. Mack Attack and Lead Dog give a high five at the 300 step mark thinking we had stepped down the last one. Crap 125 more to go. Jello legged and numb footed we reach the visitors center. We stop by the official rock marker for the approach trail and celebrate our finish. We make a pact, he will start here on his journey to complete the whole AT once out of school and I shall come here to see him off. Pa Pa and Harry are waiting on us and mom soon joins to pick up her son. We share our day’s trip coming down opposite sides of the mountain. Springer Mountain – our destination dreamed of seeing.

Tents went up one by one and before we knew it tent city was alive. Captain prepared a quick flap jack breakfast for the few who came in Friday night and were already camped in the yard awaiting our burgers this morning. Lead Dog turned Martha Stewart and flipped burgers as hard as I could. The crowd grew anxious while the burgers and hotdogs began cooking. They cast out a mouth watering aroma that drew the hikers in like the pied piper calling in his mice. Pounds of potato salad, macaroni salad, bags of chips, bean dishes, fresh fruits, cakes and cookies all finished off with a cup of ice cream and a cold beverage. Heaven, Pure Heaven. ""This is the highlight of my trip"" one gal told us. The grill stayed open from 11:30 till just about dusk with hikers coming in through out the day. I can only think of one who ate and moved on, Sherpa Dan carrying 70 pounds on his thin frame and looked slap wore out. We wish him well. This was the most active group we've had. Footballs flying thru fresbie alley. The zipline just about broke into flames it was used so much. LeftTurn Leon was one of the first in our group to take a ride himself. Braveheart entertained the crowd with his box of toys too. Yard Darts any one? Look out he's got a gun...water gun that is. ""What else you got in there?"" Let's jump rope Noni Style, darn I didn't get a picture that. But I got BonBon and Jumpin Jack Flash so be sure to check out my photos attached. As night time approached a campfire was started and Ian told his AT speech to the crowd and received a grand ovation and was presented with an AT Patch from Baltimore Jack.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/254262,"A cool morning, fog burning off to a pleasant fall day….oh and sweat dripping off your nose. That’s the sensation of hiking Angel Rest for the first hike of the season. A perfect start. We hiked in packs this last weekend. Lead Dog’s pack headed out at 9am with BonBon, Trail Whisperer and Braveheart with Gnu in tow. Ian was quick to bolt out front skipping from rock to rock just as boys should when cut loose in the great outdoors. Bonnie was wishing she’d brought her sticks as the steepness increased approaching the rock grouping of Angels Rest. Dana hasn’t been her in 38 years (I think that’s right, don’t want to cut into anyone age here) and tells us stories of youthful times hiking up this mountain with her sister to play ‘youthful’ games with old bo’s. We scanned Wilburn Valley for local landmarks and soaked up the hazy views. A snake or two was spotted as we started our hike off and then the Greyhound’s pack appeared. Yep Denny and Dotson #1 are just making their way to the top. Noni’s been bee stung and Denny is well just plain wet with sweat. We chat for a quick minute as all hikers are introduced and reintroduced from last year. Moving on down the mountain boots slipping and sticks digging in for traction the last pack is sighted. Dotson #2 and A Brand New Man are plugging away at the mountain. Hey did I just come up with a trail name? See Bruce (Sandra’s hubby) has just lost 50 pounds. Wow is right. A strapping tall man which didn’t look like he had 50 pounds to lose and is now a Brand New Man, and in MY shorts. WHAT you say?!!!! He is wearing an old pair of Lead Dog’s hiking shorts that Sandra had purchased from me over trail days. Damn and that some notion as laughter fills the woods. We move on.So even though we ALL didn’t make it out together we did manage to get a good start on the hiking season.Pictures to follow later, I’m behind…. Stay tuned for an overnight hike to be planned for this weekend, weather permitting.","Angels Rest

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/255144,"We cut through the fog and misty rain trekking the ridge which connects McAfee Knob and Dragons Tooth called Saw Tooth Ridge. I guess you are wondering what happened to the Cold Mountain hike? Well we had some cancellations from our pack and with mostly rain forecasted for an overnight I opted for a local hike so we ended up in Catawba. Captain brought his trail companions Nikon and Niles which worked out just fine. That’s dog per hiker. Just us two, eager enough to walk in the elements.  We dropped our trucks so we only had to walk one way covering the 7 miles. Of course it was switchbacks as soon as we stepped on the trail and we all know what that means? Just a little climb to get the blood pumping. The trail pops out of a small wooded section passing over a stream and through a rolling cow pasture. Fog rested on the upcoming ridge we are soon to hike. “Oh my, are we gonna climb up that?” The pasture takes a turn for the mountain and we see the next white blaze peeking between a cut in the woods about 500 feet up. The power line is our guide. The light rain feels good on our faces. Once on the ridge the woods are vibrant with fall colors. The path is quite uneven cutting between trees and rocky ledges. Nikon senses ‘something’. His ears and tail tucked walking so close to me he leans against my leg. We hear gun shots way off to our right but can’t see anything. Humm hunters in the fog that ain’t good!!!! Niles trots along as if he hasn’t a care in the world leading our way back to our other truck. A short a sweet hike it was. We didn’t see a sole on our section today everyone was up at McAfee we assume since the parking lot was occupied. Our legs felt good and we worked out those lungs AND we didn’t have to set up camp with a big chance of rain. A great little starter hike for the season too, 7 miles in 3.5 hours, that’s right on schedule.","Saw Tooth Ridge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/256657,"Have you ever been on a trip and not real sure just how far it will be before you get to your destination? Or have you ever been on some dirt country road and wonder just how long you could ‘go’ before running into another sole? Well both those questions were on the minds of some hikers I know this weekend.Putting on the trail at a later time than normal was quite different for me but all the same enjoyable. Starting at 2:30 there’s no fog to contend with, no need to put on those layers of clothes to just pull them right back off AND you can talk yourself in packing just a few more ‘extras’ for the campsite which was ONLY 2 miles AND A BIT away. Now if you are wondering just how long a bit is well it’s just a little under a quarter of a mile. However if you ask my hiking partner going in he’d say “that was the longest 2 miles AND A BIT I’ve ever walked!” Larry led our way to Laurel Creek Shelter only stopping to ask how much farther? How much farther? Anxious he was to get to our destination and check the football scores on the little green radio. We past the Blair Witch House just short of the shelter, an old home place tucked back in the bend of the mountain surrounded by beautiful tall oak trees. This was by far the most vibrant section of golden leaves I can remember seeing. Very peaceful but had an allusion of spookiness with the black-hand prints dotting the clap boards on the structure. Once at camp Larry gathered fire wood, in between radio tuning and I pitched our tent while wondering what time our other two hikers might make it in. Then the fidgeting started. Just like an ant in a hot skillet Larry popped around the shelter. Checking his radio, pouring another beverage, when are we eating, when will the others arrive, check the radio some more, pour another beverage. Hey bud don’t touch that bottle..THAT’s MINE!!!!The sun drops lower, I hear a rustle, is it the wind nop it’s a Greyhound and a Dotson. They have made it. Camp comes alive with chatter…That was the longest 2 miles AND A BIT I’ve ever walked says Denny. Lead Dog has been blasted once again for her mileage calculation. Which IS correct I might add. Another rustle, a fellow and his little dog-Sid- are coming into camp. He is hiking for a few days alone to see how he likes the AT without his hiking buddy from 4 years past. He is quite tired looking and I do believe happy to see company. Heck he had to be because you know us questions questions. Sid climbed up on Hugh’s sleeping bag and took a nap till popcorn time around the campfire. Jiffy pop does work over a campfire quite nicely. With our bellies full of food and many laughs we turn the lights out and go to bed. Oh wait I have to tell the head light story….Yours truly, miss I have everything in order, prepared to the -nth degree, no need to carry anything extra…well my lamp didn’t work. Damn I checked this before I left, it worked. Larry got my goat by telling our new friend just how ‘prepared’ he was and proceeded to hand me extra batteries to use. I have heard some night creatures before but never have I been awakened by a cattle call. The adjacent fields along Rt. 42 have numerous cows and they all must have decided to beller at the same time before sun up. It was as if they were just around the corner of the shelter. We begin to break camp, Sid and Hugh have gone, it’s gonna be another beautiful autumn day. Look what Larry has brought back from the watering hole…a little Bon Bon. Yep Bonnie has hiked in from 42 to meet us for our trip over Kelly’s Knob. And guess what she say’s?…That was the longest 2 miles AND A BIT. Will it end?The knob was touched with hints for burnt orange backed with a light blue sky. The blocks of rock broken like someone took a wedge to section them apart. Denny not so close to the edge! We trek on to our pick up point at John’s Creek Road. Down Down Down over the rocky fire road. We are early but Captain is always early so we shouldn’t have to wait too long. It’s 2:00 now. Tick tock tick tock. 2:30 that’s pick up time. Where’s Captain? I sure could us a cold beverage about now each of us clammers over and over. 3:00, ok I’m walking out of here Denny says, Noni put your boots on. We follow suite and begin walking down that long dirt country road…….We wonder how far we can go before running into a sole. It’s a long way back to our cars I know that for a fact. Do you hear that? It’s coming fast…like a Captain in a big white truck??!!!. Yeeehaaaa it’s him, it’s him.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/256650,"We walked a path of many colors out of Trout Creek towards Dragon’s Tooth. I have walked this section many times with none as vibrant as Saturday’s. The under growth came alive with orange, yellows and reds. A narrow trail surrounded by short new pines, every needle hanging with remaining rain drops. This section was once baron with broken black trees from a forest fire some years ago. Trail crews have moved the trail so we now wind around the hills missing the many puds. I am startled by bow hunters. Dad and son are setting quietly on a log waiting for us to be seen because we sure could be heard. According to them, heard for some distance too. Imagine that! Just past the shelter junction the woods opens up to a small grassy area surrounded by the ‘yellow forest’. Noni’s trail talk begins just shortly after Big Bruce sports her purple head band and begins swinging his back porch. I missed that porch by being out front, damn the luck. Switch backs lead us to Hemlock Point for a nice photo shot. Rocky path from here on out as the trail runs the ridge line. Deer! Deer! Two small does are feeding just below us not even threatened by our presence. Soon we see Catawba Valley to our left. There’s McAfee knob and Sawtooth Ridge. Seems a long way from here, 17 miles to be exact. I see Beckers Gap, the open field leading to Sawtooth. The valley is full of color dotted with red and yellow. The Tooth was rather busy today so we decided to eat below and then go adventuring later after some of the dare devils finished their scampering around. You should have seen the cat pack. Sandra’s lunch box was loaded for bear or should I say two bears. She and Bruce had enough grub in that pack to feed us for a couple days I’d say. Django just waited patiently for any crumbs to be dropped his way. Cool air blows in while we make tracks back the way we came. Then an aroma comes over my shoulder, it’s the two thru hikers from the tooth. Two smelly boys heading south, Captain Ozzie (New Hampshire) and Chevrolet (Connecticut). They have resupplied in Troutdale after being quite hungry so they are loaded down and still flying. I try to keep pace with them while talking dang my leg can’t stretch that far. I’m clipping along pretty fast leaving my hiking buds behind, which I was scolded for I might add. Lead Dog was drawn away like the mice listening to the Pied Piper’s music. We go our separate paths at the shelter junction leaving them with thoughts of that pizza delivery down the trail at Partnership shelter. Walking alone I think of hikes past and present and just where I will be in years to come. Out here on this trail I am sure of it.","Trout Creek to Dragon's Tooth

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/257002,"The key word today my fellow hikers is….Accountability. Notice closely within this word is another word COUNT. We all know the method of how to count by adding one number to the next or in our case one mile to the next. Also closely related to counting is rounding. Rounding a number from say 9.8 would be 10. Now you tell me which had you rather hike 9 miles or 10? RIGHT 9!! You have now just learned Lead Dog’s method of counting and why she is now going to be held accountable with the Harper’s Ferry ATC headquarters.With sunny skies and elevation to climb we set out on our 9ish mile hike to see all we could see. Handsome Harry dropped into town by way of Mississippi giving us that other car to hike back to. We left one car at Cornelius Creek Shelter access then headed to Petites Gap. “Why are we driving DOWN the parkway?” Noni asks.“So we can get our down in today” Lead dog smiles.We put on the trail …a cool mid morning with clear skies as we head up to Thunder Mountain each turn leading you to believe you are at the top. NOT! I pull away from my pack they are grumbling over ‘something’. I guess it must be the heat NOT! I take a rest a top a rock and enjoy the warm rays of sunshine. It is still quite cool as I see my breath. Where are they? Then I hear Noni’s voice they have had CHOColate. “That’s what you get for getting out front smart ass”. Is this the top? No worries guys we get to go down now!We make our way to the overlook which is not as colorful as I had hoped but still nice to see out. Winding along the ridge line we walk crossing the parkway a few times, stopping traffic I might add, while Niles decides to wander in the road like an old man whose lost his way and doesn’t really care. Nikon sporting his new lime green pack is spotted from far off and avoided with ease. Not far to the shelter now it’s 1:00.Oh no, a trail sign. They will figure out my counting method of MADNESS!! Maybe they won’t see it. A calculator was not needed to determine that our day was clocking out to total a 10 miler not a 9 miler as the digits were being added together. Handsome Harry was quick to call me out and threatened to report me to Harper’s Ferry possibly banning me from my lead duties. Captain down right labeled me a liar and accused me of being a republican like that was bad!!  After refueling it was off to see the Guillotine and Apple Orchard Mtn. The AT passes right through two rock walls like a hallway with a large boulder wedged between them above your head ready to drop it’s mighty load. A rocky path twists up around the edge of Apple Orchard Mtn till you pop out on top of the world. A big open grassy field leads to the FAA tower which resembles a giant soccer bowl resting on a pedestal. WOW! We can be seen from the interstate and the parkway.Fall color is starting to fade to browns and burnt orange just a few bright trees remain. “Check out how the colors blend together man”. Hey put that dooby down dude. Blackrock overlook was our best view of the day looking off the backside of the ridge with not a house in sight. The long walk was well worth it.

Look snow!Yes, we had the full range of weather hiking to our lodge on Mt. Leconte. Just a week prior temps in the teens and yet today we hike in shorts and tee shirts expecting 30's for our night’s stay, PERFECT!We met at Alum Cave parking mid morning election day loaded down with all our cold weather clothes and few extra items in the packs. HEAAVY! Bonnie’s pack was so full it kept unzipping as she walked. I, myself, felt I could pack better for a week’s trip knowing I can only take the essentials rather than one nighter where you think, ah what’s one more item gonna matter. The Go-lite Girls from NC (Shortcut Sherry and Shoeless Sandy) had only a small day pack each with lunch, water and MAYBE a shoe change for later. And let me tell ya Sandy needed a shoe change. What she needed was duct tape to keep her toes in her shoes. Them boots were slap wore out but fit like a glove I’m sure. Making our way along Alum Cave Creek we chatter in a long train, there are 7 of us. Those of us having hiked this before are sharing old trip tales with the one’s who have not. Terry begins to worry if she will make it. Having to climb 2800 feet up this mountain gives her reason to second guess herself but we all encourage her all will be just fine. Besides you don’t want to miss supper at 6:00 do ya? Arch Rock is our first big trail site. A natural formed arch made of jagged slat rock with the trail passing right though it. Very narrow I might add with steep man made steps to help you climb up through the opening. Before we go up I have to take a group photo. Cheers of GO GO GO rout me on to make a quick dash from the camera set up spot up on the bridge in 10 seconds before the shutter snaps. It was if I was back racing my bike and crossing the finish line. YEEHAA!The trail turns steeper as we make our way higher with more views over the Smokies. Alum Cave can’t be much farther which means half way. The trail is rather crowded with hikers today. Many heading to the same destination as us and those just out to see how far they can make it. Larry is quick to tell those past over and over that he will let them know just how he is doing once he makes it to the lodge and sets down.I find a few big rocks in the shade for us the gather around for lunch. Yes shade. It’s warm here below the cave which really isn’t a cave but a giant sandy slop under a massive rock overhang. They say the alum was once mined here and hauled out by road. Humm wonder where that road is? While we gather for a departing photo Larry sneaks a bumper sticker on our Democratic Leader, El Cap-E-Tan showing his support for the opposite party as he marches to Leconte. It is election day you know!!! I’m sure his dad was turning over in his grave see his son wearing McCain/Palin on his back.  Just a few more miles to face with many cabled ledges to help navigate the trail in icy conditions of which we don’t have to worry. Above the tree tops now we can see miles and miles of rolling mountains. The sun warms my face and arms as I stop and soak up a ray of two while waiting on my pack to catch up. Keep in mind I didn’t stray too far ahead of them today. Look the trail has turned flat a sure sign of reaching the top. The path is lane like cobble stones with a dusting of snow along the sides. WHAT? How can this be? We just came from the sauna under Alum Cave and there’s snow up here? Cool fresh air rushes between the tunnel of trees taking us to Leconte. I see the huts, we are here!Campers walk by with gloves, wool hats, heavy jacket. We are still in shorts. Thermometer says 50 but with a cool breeze must be 40's. We check out our lodge and surrounding buildings like kiddies coming in to a new play ground darting from one place to another. Ahhhh Leconte, just as I remember.Just as luck might have it we are in the same lodge we had on our last trip. Sleeps 10 and a stones throw from the kitchen. We make ourselves at home hanging wet hiking clothes out on railings to dry and settle into our rocking chairs for chat time. Wonder where Harry is? Seems to be a common question these days. He is to meet us up here on his own time, that Straggler (new trail name by the way), hiking the same route AND hoping to be here before the dinner bell rings. No worries Harry, this group would NEVER think of eating your portions. Good thing Denny ain’t here cause I KNOW you’d be shit out luck on the wine deal! The Straggler shows at 4:00.Speaking of dinner it was wonderful. A hardy meal served home style. Hot chicken and rice soup with corn bread for starters. Then beef roast covered with brown gravy, mash potatoes, green beans, cookies AND that bottomless glass of wine. YummmEE. It took one glass of red wine and a hot stove behind Bonnie for her to start a sweatin!. And that was just the beginning of her hot flashes which earned her the name of Hot Box. The heat wave continued back in our lodge with the warmth from our propane units rising to her top bunk. She melted right into the sheets. We talked in our front room huddled around the little stove. Only the flicker of oil lamps lighting up our faces. Stories of other trails to come and some from our past. Stories of new parties to come and some from our past. Laughter fills the air as Terry proclaims she IS Love Party and no I can’t explain in great detail about this new trail name. You’ll just have to come next time to find out.  Larry kept us up to-date on the election results as we trail off to bed. Once again let the noises of the night begin....A creaking front door, purring hikers, random human shadows drifting in and outside for night relief. Say Shortcut just how many times DID you go out? I know on my trip into the night was peaceful. Stars hanging all around our little piece of paradise high in the sky. One of us was not so lucky on her trip out. A misplaced head lamp and sockless about to pee her pants she bolted from the building. Squatted precariously under our lone pine tree she hears something. Then a light.. She’s spotlighted. A deer in the headlights. Yikes! Flash... back inside to safety. Morning at Leconte is like none other. I walk out our front door above the clouds and civilization below. The mountains turn red from the sun casting her beams to awaken the day. A skiff of snow has fallen on the paths connecting huts and lodges. A crisp morning but soon warms nicely for our hike off.One last meal before we depart. Breakfast! I’m starvin the meal bell rings. Eggs, Canadian bacon, biscuits, grits, and pancakes. We load our bellies then say our good byes to Harry. He again shall Straggle off on his own path having to hike back Alum Cave Trail to make a conference call for work. Dang work. The rest of us trek off Trillium Gap Trail in hopes of see the Llamas which are due to pass this way. Yes Llamas! They are used to pack supplies up and off the mountain several times a week. First we must carefully watch our steps as this trail is icy in spots. A nice trail with a gradual grade off the mountain and views out the entire way. Winding around the mountain seemed like deja vo with every switch back. Then around the bend comes a man then THE LLAMAS!!! Cool we have met them. WOW. Nine of so of them, tied together like a train. Each one with supplies packed on each of their sides. We step out of there way as they pass looking at us curiously but ever so calm. My trip seems complete now. I so wanted to see them. Down down down we go slowly ending our adventure. One last trail treet, Grotto Falls. A small water fall which the trail passes right behind. I felt like the Indian guy who hide behind the falls in Last of the Mohicans as I slipped by. More people are on the trail now which is a sure sign of a trail head. Our car awaits along with 30 more. Cars are lined down the road. It’s just past noon and we are off the trail. Another great hiking trip with old friends and new.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/257647,"The Mountain Lake that once was is no more. However it could appear as mysteriously as it has drained away. We scoped out the lake bed from one end to the other walking from the old shore line’s dock, through her grassy field, over the cracked lake bed which looked like the moon’s crust as I envision, finally down to the trickling stream which pooled in a small circle about the size of a pitcher’s mound. Wow all gone. I can remember fishing from the shoreline which used to back clear up to the tree lined rim. All gone!Ian quickly scampered from one spot to the next looking for ancient artifacts and was the first to step in a sink hole labeling him Mud Boot for the day. We saw two long lost boats that had sank to the bottoms of the lake and a few old beer can’s left from an evening cruise on the waters. We only guessed where the man’s remains were discovered and kept a close eye out for a human bone or two but none discovered.It was a cold day with winds keeping a chill the air. I laid out a trip that would encompass many trails connecting them to circle the conservancy boundaries. First Bald Knob, a steep ½ mile up directly behind the hotel. We could see down over Pembroke and many miles on. What blue skies to start the day with wispy white clouds above. On to our next trail….Bear Cliffs.So do bears really hang out on these cliffs? We didn’t see any as we walked the rocky path. Leaves are totally down and rocks are a hiding them under every step. I follow the yellow marks this path has and they just stopped. Back up Ian let’s find our last one. We do but the path still goes THIS way. So we carry on on THE path. ‘Where are you taking us Lead Dog?” Captain asks. “On an adventure!” And an adventure it was too. We wound around the Salt Pond Mountain following our secret path as Trail Whisperer put it. Why follow some marked path when you can let the mystery path lead us. But to where? What?We walk for a couple of miles and come out to the Stables. Heck this is where I was going to take us in the first place cool. No horses to ride now. An injury some time ago has closed this area. Too bad. We stop for lunch just past here on some cut logs and are out of the winds. The trail dogs play cat and mouse. Gnu jumping back and forth teasing the tied dogs Nikon and Niles. Come get me, catch me if you can!!!Up and down a few little puds on the Pink trail we connect to the RED trail. Nikon wasn’t a bit happy with these weird colored marks on the trees but still had no trouble following the paths leading out of some uncertain places where marks had faded. We start a climb which was quite a pull considering we are on the top of a mountain. Working up a good sweat and heart rate I pop out of the woods to a large grassy field, it’s the old golf course. The trail runs around the tree line leading to the club house. Nothing left but a rectangular stone building looking over the valley. You could see Angle’s Rest and the ridge the AT runs along, Peaks Knob over in Dublin, 460 and the road I just drove on to get up here. The course walk was about a mile or so still cleared off and signs of old tee boxes grown over with field grass. I’d hike up here to play 9 holes I tell ya.Only 2.4 miles back to the hotel, we take the old golf road for a leisurely finish to the day. A day filled with new sights, trails and mystery. Mystery of walking our secret path and the mystery of nature’s power.","Mountain Lake

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/258211,"Hit the brakes!” “No, don’t do that!”Noni puts a white knuckle grip on anything she can grab. Nikon hunkers down, hind legs squatting to keep from landing on the dash board as Denny gathers up the back end of the big white truck that was heading towards the fence. Nothing like getting your heart rate up first thing in the morning without setting foot on the trail yet!! We had just dropped Captain’s truck above Miss Tilly’s place to hike back to and loaded up for our drive to Angel’s Rest when Dale Earnhardt took us on a wild ride. I see now why this road gets the name Sugar Run. When it snows your arss ends gonna run away from ya!A Cold morning at 17 degrees and yes we had SNOW. The once crackling of leaves have gone just snow crunching under our boots as we climb to Angel’s Rest. Sure glad the winds aren’t blowing or it would be bitter. With just under 2 miles to the first overlook we warm quickly and come out of a few layers. The Greyhound sports just as little has he can in the clothing attire and is freezing out of the gates. He walks at a pace even I have trouble keeping in front of. Now let me give you a visual of this mighty hiker. I’ll start from the ground up so not to spoil the ending….Boots the size of sleds, hiking socks pulled up tight over his black long johns under his zipped off hiking shorts, ONE long sleeve shirt covered only with a fleece vest. Remember it is 17 degrees now. Spock gloves to cover his hands which would work well with a Mork hand shake, Nanu Nanu. Then to cap it all off has a summer garden hat, holes for ventilation, I guess?? And the final piece of true hiking gear ingenuity EAR MITTENS. NOT ear muffs now, ear mittens. Individual ear cups that close around the ears with no strings attached. AND Noni please “don’t fuuudle with the ear mittens!!!!”Setting on rock waiting on my fellow hikers to reach me I soak up the sun’s rays. Sure feels good as my body cools down from the climb. Hard to believe how hot you can get pressing up a mountain’s side with temps in the 20’s. Their chatter fills the air with laughter soon to follow on a jab at Captain for hauling a McCain/Palin sticker up different mountain. The views from Angels Rest and over Wilburn Valley were clear as a bell. Too early to stop for lunch so we head on to the double power lines. Walking the ridge was nice and easy giving our legs a rest. Snow had drifted over the trail like speed bumps in a parking lot and just about that far apart too. While eating we could see the valley road we had just driven on to reach our hiking start. Red and green house roof tops spot the down below. Halfway home right? Do you see my ear brows raised?(clue: if raised brow = a probable lie)The trail turns off the ridge as we hit the old forest road, wide lined with tunnels of laurels. Lead Dog stretches her legs with Captain close on my heels as we put a little distance between our other two. Reaching Dennis Gap we see evidence of a deer kill. The trail looked as if a sled had come thru flattening out the snow tracks. Spots of blood and animal hair only remain. Sure hope it was a deer??? Nikon races back and forth across the trail sniffing every deer path made.One last climb past the shelter heading to Doc’s Knob. “Man I don’t remember that climb being so long” Rocky once on top too. Every step was like finding your footing crossing a deep creek hole. You can’t see what’s under there and once you put your weight down, well you might just BE down. I stop at our last over look, Doc’s Knob. Evening sun casts shadows on the rock ledge. I dare not climb up out with the snow on and no one to keep a hold of. I trek on. Nikon leads the way to his daddy’s truck anxious for me to open the doors. No standing around today. Once in the shady holler cold cold cold. I quickly crank up the big diesel to get her warm and wait on my troops to arrive. Sure glad we aren’t camping out tonight.","Angel's Rest to Doc's Knob

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/258772,"With one truck out of commission and forecasted wind gusts we decided to hike the bottom ground Sunday. Stony Creek Road was quite slick on the drive in. The national forest boundaries don’t get that special attention some of the other roads receive. Once past the big lime plant it was winter wonderland. Snow covered roads and trees still dusted with snow from the night before. Temperature 22 degrees.We put on the trail at the kiosk below Pine Swamp Shelter and with Lead Dog's suggestion AND prodding I convinced the boys to hike up to see the finished shelter’s roof. With new rafters it held out the snow quite nicely. And to think WE helped!!!! We inspected the workmanship and could see hikers or someone had used the fireplace to keep warm recently. A perfect place for a future campout for sure. Trekking back down the way we came I notice the trail turned blue. Yes Blue Blazes….”Where did the AT go?” We walked the ‘old AT’ path now Blue and could see where the white paint had been scrapped off and replaced with blue. Hummm. Just a short ways along the connection was noticeable even with the snow on the ground. The ‘new AT’ comes in here, I had to see where it leads. I leave the boys and double back on the new AT and see it walked above the old path and connects back to the original path that went to the shelter. I guess they wanted to take the trail more away from the road. Wasn’t much though.Catching up with Leon, Captain and the dogs they are talking politics and sports and who knows what else so I proceed on past to let boys be boys. The smell of burning pine from local homes and the sound the creek trickling over the rocks made our short walk very peaceful. Oh and the snow was a bonus. Just a few PUDS to face along this stretch and some tricky slopes to keep our feet from slipping out from under us. FINALLY, Pine Swamp Bridge is complete. Wow some bridge too!!! Massive compared to the old bridge and no chance of this sucker getting washed out either. It even had a ramp from the road side which I feel could be used for wheelchair access maybe. Steps on the forest side would prevent them from continuing on the trail but would still give a person the chance to look down the creek. Very nice!Deciding to walk the road since, ‘we just walked that way’ was the vote. Again the road IS slick with hard packed snow, AND guess what? It’s windy too. Yep out of the trees protection we faced the winds for a mile or so. Speaking of face, WATCH OUT CAPTAIN!!! Two dogs tied to his chest’s lead line, sticks in one hand and feet flying out from under him WHAM. Smack on the road with only the hair from his whiskers to keep him from hitting his face first. All ok he gathers himself up and chuckle pops out. “I know this road is slanted but it ain’t Bristol Captain” Larry says while dusting the snow from his chest. Funny how you can navigate snow, rocks, steep paths and then slip on ‘somewhat’ flat ground. Almost back to Captains we come to a choo choo train. Yes a play ground train is just a waiting for some ‘trail fun’. I man the engine room and ride!!! Sure glad we aren’t up on Wind Rock Ridge about now I would have missed my train.","Pine Swamp Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/259001,"8:37 walking alone today. No trail buddies, no Nikon racing up and back with excitement, no moans and groans about the terrain. Just Lead Dog for a walk in the woods. The Rice Fields seemed the best choice for me to hike alone. It’s close by, has a section or two of climbing which is perfect for me and a nice view at the top. With a sunny start to the day I don’t need much in the way of warm clothes, YET. Once over that first knob and around the bend I can hear the winds blowing above me. The trees are talking with gust running through them. Working up a sweat I know I will get chilled if I don’t add layers on the ear, hands and body before making the ridge line. I’m at the turn at 10am I should be at the shelter by 11 I say to myself. Small dustings of snow lined the trail once near the top and in shady sections. Wew hang on to those gloves the winds just about take them away as I put on my buff. Glad the sun it out to help with some warmth. Trekking at Lead Dog pace I watch the valley houses quickly pass me by. A blue jay tries to keep sight of me as I do of him but we soon depart. The only bird I saw for the day. The ground is frozen in spots where leaves aren’t down to protect the soil. I see the Rice field grasses leaning over as the north winds rush over them. Rather tall too almost up to my knees in spots. Stepping to the edge of the field peering off to West Virginia gusts stagger me back and forth. The shelter is calling my name. Ah some protection from elements. I check out the area. The fire pit has been nicely organized for fire seating. A map has been drawn on the shelter logs showing water location and the lack of. A bottle of lotion and talc powder is left with instructions for the thru hikers to keep moisturized! Eating my warm soup I read the trail journal and there ARE other hikers out here just not today. A group of 5 or so has already past heading to Springer. Achilles, Pounce, etc have “froze there nuts off” the last few days around Nov 23rd. 20, 10, 5, 0 degrees they say. Most are anxious for snow but have only had rain. One writes he can’t wait for a warm bed, hot food and back to doing day hikes. Looking out over the fields drinking my last warm bit I agree this ain’t too bad. Calmer winds greet me back on the trail. I shed off the jacket and gloves and begin singing the Christmas tones in my head…OUT LOUD!! Elvis seemed to be the theme. Santa Bring My Baby Back to Me and I’ll Ah Hav Ah Bluuuu xmas without YOU. I sang so that the animals started runnin. A hunters delight pops out of know where white tail up and antlers galore. It disappears as quickly as it appeared. The woods were like, muted. No sound as it leapt over the trail in two hops, its hoofs not making a sound hitting the leaves either. Was it Santa’s reindeer?A whistle blows, it’s the Celanese train below. I stop to check out the water source on the side of the mountain. A bubble floats to the top of the barrel it’s a frog living in here. Look out for giardia! Smoke rises from the Celanese stacks I’m almost done. Rounding the last turn I’m frightened by a day hiker with his dog. He jumped about as high as I. We both pass, ‘have a good hike’. And a good hike it was.","641 to Rice Fields

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/259421,"Say is that little dog a BEAR dog?” Django struts out into the woods with not a fear in this world. The bear hunters our out today. They track these precarious creatures of which we never see on our treks. Oh yes we know they exist as a hunter tells his story of seeing one being checked in at Trent’s store this morning. The trucks are lined up at our trail head with all their owners heading the ‘other’ way THANK GOODNESS. We can hear the dogs in the distance as we fade into the rainy day.Our hike began at Crandon hiking north to Kimberling Creek. I’d hiked this section a few times and usually in the rain it seems. Django was our trail dog of the day sporting a new never tested doggie rain suit. The strategically altered Kroger bag fit over his back tied loosely around each front legs and then a spot hole near the back for his tail to pop through. Sure wish I’d got a photo of that. Debating on to wear or not to wear rain pants I tested the science of my gear. Meaning my pants got saturated, not soaked mind you, but grew wetter as the rain showers continued off but mostly on for the first half of our hike, lunch stop Jenny Knob Shelter. This would be our only opportunity to eat out of the rain and even though early in our trip we elected to take advantage of some cover. I’m sure this being Bruce’s first rain hike he was puzzled as to why the Leader had not worn her rain pants. Oh mind you my troops followed suit no rain pants either. So here comes the outcome of ‘the test’. Wet hiking pants WILL dry underneath rain pants. Pretty cool!! I knew they would in your sleeping bag but that was overnight. How would this work with several hours of hiking left and with temps just above freezing. Well it does work however I wouldn’t recommend it with temps much colder or more than a day hike. We shook off some water, ate lunch, checked out the water source which was bone dry even with rain and Django put on his coat of many colors. Changing from bag lady to gator bate. Some more gear testing doggy style, wait did I just say a naughty? Sandra again rummages thru her pack and pulls out a gator to be used as a rain suit for her baby. Only 5ish miles to go….The trail walks the ridge a bit and winds down along a few switch backs only to take us back up and over a knoll or two. Not a scenic hike but a nice walk in the woods. “Where’s the field?” I know it is not too far now. My two followers are getting somewhat anxious to finish as I. The skies try to lighten up but only to turn grey shortly thereafter. Step after step I look for the field which tells me we are near the end. A hunter waits around a turn on the trail. Yikes he startles me. We can’t be far now. We see the merging streams of Kimberling Creek, the big swinging bridge. And boy did she sway as we crossed over. Glad this is a short ride or I’d get sea sick. Shedding off rain gear we laugh about trip in the rain and all our gear tests of the day. I have to say the most unusual test was The Cuddle Dud Test. That’s where a 6 foot something Big Bruce fits into 5 foot and a tad Sandra’s long underwear. Now how does that really work? TIGHT!!!! Nice lace Bruce. New trail name Cuddle Dud or is that Cuddle Dude?","Crandon

So buying a rain jacket is a sure fire way to turn off the rain showers. We are all pretty much geared out to get wet except Ian so we make a quick pit stop at one of the outfitter stores in Damascus to find him a rain jacket. Once adorned the sun pops out and the clouds clear to blue skies. Sweet!!!Captain and I dial in our watches. Yes Lead Dog has a new watch, has an altimeter, barometer, and chronograph to track a day’s workout or more. 2200 feet soon to become 4200 feet can you see my eyes wide open and that squinty smile of wonderment? I’m gonna love this!!! Our hike is to Buzzard Rock today which sets a mile or so BELOW Whitetop. That’s right below we didn’t go to the top. Whitetop was far from white today. The previous month’s snow was all gone just balsam pines, knarly trees and field grasses abound. Cutting into the woods off Rt. 58 we wind around laurel thickets and creek crossing popping out to our first open cow pasture. I can see our upcoming mountain to climb and remember there ain’t no switchbacks up there. Just two great long runs of trail to crest out below the rock. I check my altimeter every so often to see how much elevation we have come, pretty cool 3200 feet only 1000 more to go. No puds on this trip today all UP one way!!!We stop ever so often to wipe the sweat from our brow and to gather up together. Captain and I are down to shorts and sleeves, while Mom and son have their extra layers tied on them like street people. Braveheart kept our trail clean by picking up left beer cans in the woods earning him the name of the Tin Man. Cans clattering with every step while poked through his walking sticks. It was like he’d speared a fish or three. There it is guys, Buzzard Rock, it reaches to touch the sky from this angle of the trail. Winter grasses part with the AT meandering through them. Our three trail dogs scamper to the top along with the little fellow. Looking back over our shoulders we can see how far we have come and are now above the clouds. Trail Whisperer gives thanks to the day given to us and the surroundings it beholds. Breathe taking. After homemade maple syrup cookies and grub in our bellies we hop on a rock cropping for a summit shot. All down hill from here! The Captain takes his ‘usual’ adventure hike jumping off the AT cutting down through the woods to intersect with the trail below. Us traditionalist such as we are continue on the beaten path to meet up with him. Hootie Hoot, Hootie Hoot.

The trail grows narrow with balsam pines heavy with snow. I can smell winter. UUUMMM.We are missing something…NIKON… no bark to tells us come on, no darting across in front of us. We miss him. We have however picked up our Straggler, Handsome Harry, for the day. Taking him and Captain to the highest peak in VA and on new trail for them makes for an exciting trip for Lead Dog. Views to our south are grey and threatening. Only a matter of time before the rains come in. Temps are rather comfortable for being above 4400 feet and the winds are calmer that normal. We are surprised to run into more overnight hikers than day trippers. Met some Bama Boys who ‘were looking for some place in VA with snow”. Well honey you found it. Why not pick the Mt Rogers?!!!Look ponies!!! Yes the wild ponies of the Grayson Highlands are grazing to our right. We try to count them but only specks in the field so I go for a closer look. Man they were farther out there than I thought. They heeee hee so the boys can hear and I get a little nudge from red pony for a pet on the nose. Wonder how long they have lived up here?Reaching the junction of the AT path from Elk Garden to the shelter we take the side trail to Mt. Rogers. Now you would hope to have a grand view from the highest point at 5729 feet. But NOOOO. Just a place in the middle of thick hemlocks. A circle somewhat cut out to have light from above shine in on you. A marker is on a rock dated 1933 I guess declaring ‘the’ spot. Returning back on the AT our storm has arrived. Winds are picking up and those mountain ranges way south to Roan are no long in view. Snow squalls run across the ridge mixed with rain pellets. Dang they hurt on bare skin. Thomas Knob Shelter is strategically placed along this ridge facing south to keep the north winds from blowing her down. I hear voices up above. Pop and head peaks down form the loft. There are 3 boys hold up from last night waiting out the storm passing today. They have minimal rain gear and are ‘tenting’ in the shelter for warmth. The Bama Boys had stayed here last night too so it was a happening place. They said the full moon and snow on the ground had illuminated the field.Captain and I are bound for Rhododendron Gap to complete his section. Heck it’s only a mile out can’t be too bad. Harry turns back. Without his rain shell decides this exposed walk isn’t for him. Shoot I was beginning to wonder if it was for US!!! Captain what are you doing? Why didn’t you put on your rain suit in the shelter as we try to catch his jacket billowing in the wind gusts like chasing a run away kite. Once properly adorned we head along a sketchy marked path. With the snow and many trails connecting along the AT it was hard to stay on the ‘right’ one. I have grown rather warm and step in a group of pines to get out of a layer and wait on Captain to come past. I wait. I yell out. I wait. I wonder. Where the hell is he at? Did he turn back? Did he get lost? Heck am I lost? I can read the headlines now:TWO HIKERS LOST AT MT ROGERS, GOT SEPERATED WHILE STRIPPING IN THE PINES.I decide he has missed me by ‘getting off the trail’ and shortcutting the ditch the AT is in and walked on past me. I head on to Rhode Gap. A yell every now again and finally a hootie hoot I get in return. He is down below me and has heard every yelp from the Lead Dog. We have a good laugh and make our destination and return to find Harry making friends with the shelter boys. Two more hikers pass and are planning on staying the night so the boys will have yet another group of friends to talk to. We head back to the garden slipping with every step. The trail is a slushy stream now and the rains are just as steady shower. Our gear has been tested today by all the elements and has done quite well. We have done quite well I have to say.

Yep it’s all your fault Captain. Larry’s out here ‘taking one for the team’, ‘getting his brownie points’ FREEZING HIS GOMERS OFF while you are keeping watch on the well house pipes. Leaving the warmth of our car we trek out into the frozen woods. I would say tundra but there’s just not enough snow or hors frost to justify that description. However every breath did freeze on Larry’s sun glasses. I can’t see. I can’t see. He’s wrapped up like Ralph’s little brother from The Christmas Story. Sure hope he doesn’t have to pee. We are off to visit the 1890 settlement of Lindamood. We cross the boggs into the open fields and are thankful that the winds are calm. Only the buzz of the powerlines to be heard as we pass under them sending juice to the outlining community of Groseclose. The rhodies are showing us just how cold it is out here. Their leaves wrapped so tight you couldn’t squeeze a pencil up through them. We check out the school house and the many play ground rules and how many lashes you receive for violating each. No playing of cards Larry!!! 10 lashes. We have a little play ground fun of our own by jumping on the make shift see saw. Moving on to the farm, which I had never walked down to, was pretty neat. I can see me living here just fine. A nice big farm house with a creek in the back yard. Oh yeaaah. Old time farm equipment is displayed in a barn; a corn grib and granary labled as such. “I can’t read a map” NO that’s not Lead dog talking. Larry has looked over our trip topo and is quite perplexed in how a map says FLAT and we are continuously walking up hill. “Damn I’ve been had.” Turning deeper in the woods more snow has accumulated. The creek is frozen on top with the water running underneath. Watch your step crossing the rocks are slick as snot. Step up step up closer to the shelter we go. I begin to sweat that’s gonna be cold drying over lunch. Warm soup and a samich help us keep the inner core warm. 20 degrees the thermometer reads. Feels colder.All return trips are shorter than the initial ‘in’ trip. We are already back at the orchard section. Yellow berry patches are every where. Some sort of field berry I call them, the size of a cherry but yellow growing on thistle bushes. I tried one one time and very hot and seedy. Apples are down from last season, picked over by the animals. Then I find a trail flower, Staghorn Sumac. Yes Sandra I looked it up with AT plant cheat sheet, thank you. Actually not really a flower but a dried pod of crimson red berries at the end of a branch. I’ve always wondered what these are and now I know. I take a sample and add a few other dried thorny finds. The Exxon sign is spotted only one last field to walk. The interstate hums with traffic. They haven’t a clue we are out here. Shoot I don’t guess anyone would expect a hiker to be out “on a day like today”. Well a day like today wasn’t so bad, was it Larry?","Groseclose/Lindamood

Anxious to get out on the trail Nikon is a rowdy boy. Niles and Ginger peacefully walk behind their masters respectfully. The foot bridge over Comers Creek is quite slick and with no side rails could make for a cold dip. The snow is a good 4 inches in places. YeehaaaBonnie is right on my heels just like old times as we head up Iron Mountain’s front slope. The ‘back train boys’, Larry and Captain are talking up a storm and solving all of our world’s problems. Of course that is between counting their farts. “Glad I’m not in that train” Bonnie says. Temps are not bad today, 30’s and no real wind to contend with. Deep blue skies set the backdrop just perfect. Checking our elevation every so often Captain and I inform we are not far from the top already. A gradual grade and snow all about I can’t recall where the crest really is. Signs tell us it is so and praise is shouted out “that is all the climbing for the day”…..so we think!!!!With a skip in our steps and powder to cushion our feet the descent off was over in a blink of an eye. Wow what a difference a change in direction makes. Wait…speaking of blinking an eye..WHERE’S GINGER?!? Now I know I saw her just a little while ago. The snow’s not that deep. GINGERRR GINGERRR!!! We back track to the last bend of the trail. My mind races fast.. She’s out HERE all alone. Will she come to find us, will she turn back to the car? Jeff’s gonna have a fit. Then I hear a sigh and a scold. “You get down here right now” as Bonnie shuffles her along. Shame on you wondering off.A few more miles to go and it’s all smooth sailing from here on out. Just a snowy walk along the mountain’s base protected in the valley. There can’t be any ascents because we parked in a GAP. RIGHT???? Ginger must have gotten the vibe of uncertainty of what was lying ahead and claimed lame. “My feet hurt mommy, pick me up”. With the icy covering on the snow her little paws were getting sore. So she got a lift for a while or so before we hit the final sign saying 2 miles to the gap.As one foot was put in front of the other I knew shortly this was NOT FLAT. We began to climb and climb and climb. At least a nice water fall appears in about a mile or so. The waters from Comers Creek Falls are mounded thick with ice. I don’t remember this! I pull away from the others I KNOW they are a cussing me about now and I shall retreat to the truck so not to be stricken with hiking sticks. Say is that the same as stoning? As they trickle into Dickey Gap each has a remark about their reflection of the last 2 miles. I shall not bore you with such trail talk only because it was such a barrage that I can’t remember them all. LOL Happy Trails once again.","Troutdale Rt. 16

Well any hike is a good hike and a day well spent in my book. I was quite surprised this morning when my driveway filled with hiking companions. Here I thought I was going to be making this hike all by my lonesome. The little yellow bug filled with the Dotsons, The Lead Dog, Django dog, and Cuddle Dude.I wonder how much of the falls will be frozen? It’s always cold back in that holler and today is no exception. Even with temps forecasted to hit 50 it’s only 25 degrees here this morning. Snowy ledges and ice buildup line the creek bank as we cross the lower trail bridge. For some reason I always take this route on the way up and return on the upper trail/logging road. I guess I like the creek walk to start the morning. Walking along it was hard to hear one another due to waters roaring and our ears covered with wool hats. The path was completely clear of ice. Some pools were iced over like a skating rink though. We looked for fish but guessed it was to cold for them to come out. Sandra and Bruce haven’t been here in some 20 years and awed at the trails new look. Rock steps placed strategically along banks and nice sturdy bridges built to with stand the rising waters of the future. We haven’t met a sole and really don’t expect to this early in the day. Only 2 cars were in the parking lot and they had been there overnight due to the frost on their windshields. Wonder where they are?The falls can be heard but not seen just yet. Only a few more twists and turns and she should appear just around the next corner. WOW. Frozen masts of water stretch from the top to bottom. The usual mist she throws off can’t be felt today. It must be captured within the walls of her. The upper landing for viewing is chained off till spring so the sign says. The lower landing where we stand is frozen over making for some entertainment with every step. We take in one last view as we climb the stairs to the upper trail for our return hike out. Then a person appears then 3 more. These are the parking lot kids. They have spent the night out here and state it wasn’t so bad. 3 fellows and a gal all of which carried army looking packs HEAVY. Noni is quick to joke SHE knows how to stay warm with 3 fellows. So just like our hike out it was all down hill from there.","Pembroke

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/261481,"Only Wikipedia can compete with the knob of knowledge we hike with on a weekly basis. THE CAPTAIN is all knowing and enjoys sharing his wealth of historical facts along with, of course, his useless information. So just where did Tinker Cliffs get its name you ask? In the civil war era those running from joining the army hide in the cliffs and made pot and pans. So they were called tinkers. And living in the cliffs well Tinker Cliffs. How about that?  We began our ascent of Tinker Mtn by way of Andy Lane trail. Now this trail was maintained by its name sake for many years and has been rerouted a few times so actual trail length is some what debatable from 2.5 miles up to 3.1. Debatable mileage, who would of thought. This trip would not be any different as we are quickly in a stitch with Noni’s trail trash talk of which I will spare you details only saying that the sweet smell of a mountain butterfly can only be attained by walking in close proximity to such a creature.  The creek still has some ice left over and snow is still in the shadows of the mountain. I’m sure there will be snow at the top AND MUD later in the day. We haven’t even begun the first pull yet and we are down to short britches and tees. Warming nicely with a southernly breeze to boot. We navigate the two hardest slopes but not without a slip or two. The ground is frozen with a slim coating of ice. Sticks are a necessary tool today. “Man this is gonna be fun coming back down later!” Noni says with a smile knowing her pants will be black with mud to at least up to her calves. Reaching the junction of Scorched Earth Gap we ponder the idea of taking the tinker loop which the sign says is 4.9 miles but not knowing where it connects along the way decide to do this another day. Carvins Cove can be seen as we almost crest the cliffs then snow is under foot at the top. Winds cool us fast as we walk at the cliff’s edges. I do love coming up here early in the morning. It’s like getting to the swimming pool first before the crowd hits. McAfee Knob can be seen from afar along with the connecting ridge walk the AT follows. I’m sure we’ll walk it again this season too.Returning to the junction the trail is turning to a mucky mess. With every step a slide follows. The trail has been rerouted leading down to Lambert’s Meadow Shelter taking us out the side of the hill instead of straight down her. Humm is this better? Well not today. The new ground is so soft we sink up almost to our shoe laces. Captain is sporting his new trail tennies and they are getting a real breakin in. Yuck for a half mile. At the shelter I checked out the lower camping area and the blue trail which has to be the loop I spoke about earlier. Next time I will come down here first and follow it’s path and see where I end up. Since we had such a hard time walking down the NEW AT we decide to take the old route back to Andy Lane which proved for the best even though quite steep. Now the real fun began. Every hiker we saw from this point on had muddy feet. We grew six inches taller with the layers of mud adding up with every hill slide. It was like walking in Frankenstein shoes. Be careful and try not wipe out!!! A few others weren’t so lucky with evidence of a mishap on their bums and legs as if they sled into home plate. Ending our day with a little birthday celebration we talked more trail trash and upcoming trips. We sure were glad we came to Andy Lane and Cliffs today. The parking lot at McAfee was the fullest I’ve ever seen. Even with the overflow added it was packed with cars flowing out onto 311 and down a side road. WOW. I will now leave you with one thought….Just how close can you get to a butterfly? Especially a VT one.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/261915,"Let me introduce you to the Giles County Bushwacking Mud Boggers. They travel in a pack of 4 (dog numbers can vary) and can climb any mountain road and hike any destined terrain. No blazed trees needed to follow or side rails to contain them. Step right up folks and enjoy the ride!!!!Our adventure began way before the boots hit the trail riding by Explorer to the top of Butt Mtn. No snow or ice to contend with ‘at this time’…just rutted out frozen mud tracks. “Keep her to the high side” my instructor tells me. Ian’s eye wide like he’s seen a ghost riding shotgun beside me. Nikon paces the back awaiting the engine to stop to set him free. Sure glad my car is up here already because I do think I’d been parking some mile or so down this grade for fear of car damage after seeing what was up ahead. The Butt Mtn firetower’s bottom ladder has been removed so access is denied. However the views from it’s McAfee looking rock is sufficient to see Pembroke, Pearisburg and Peak’s knob. Captain leads us today as the trail’s yellow blazes (mostly metal diamond plates) are sparse on the trees. Heck I might have counted 10 before they disappeared. We follow THE PATH. Captain’s stories of boyhood ramblings keep us entertained as we ramble ourselves scoping the trees for those mysterious yellow diamonds. An old road bed appears….That’s it, that’s the trail. Shortly the yellow blazes come back. Time sure flies when you’re having fun OR GOING DOWN HILL. Yep before we know it we are at the Barney’s Wall junction that means only a few miles and we’ll be down at the Falls. Our second overlook at Barney’s Wall was something. The drop was so abrupt that we set down and scotch to not quite the edge to view. Ian spots the Lower Bridge crossing of the Cascades Trail. That’s right we could see all the way down to the fork of Little Stony Creek’s waters. Not only that but once we were down on that trail we could look up and see this wall and how far up we were. I’ll show you some time. Hearing the roar of water we close in on the upper falls called Little Cascades, our lunch stop. A perfect camping area lies just across the feeding creek above her. Shallow enough to wade. Again Captain tells of times ago coming here camping with friends. He has also walked from here down the other side passing seven falls until reaching the Big Cascades. Not today though.The Cascades are thawed now. Three weeks ago - frozen, now only an ice arch remains within. I can’t believe we are the only people here right now. Cool. Just another 2 miles before our hike’s end. Dana and I talk of not feeling like we’ve hiked that far today but in reality we will have covered 10.4 miles. Makes a big difference descending all those 2000 feet instead of climbing them.We walk part of the upper trail and then decide to take part of the lower trail back crossing that same bridge we saw from way up above. Wow. We look back at Barney’s Wall one last time and then look down to realize we are missing someone….Where’s Niles? Here we go again. Another missing dog! Dana, Ian and Gnu bust back up the trail and Captain and I head down to the car. He has to be between us. Sure enough Trailwhisperer tracks him down and brings him to papa. A day full of adventures and just because we are off the trail is no sign it is ending. Remember we still have to retrieve my car. Holy cow those ruts are gonna be thawed just like the falls. As we twist and turn driving back up the mountain road my arss twists and turns in the truck seat getting tighter and tighter with worry about driving off of here. No worries Captain chuckles you just stay in my tracks. Yea right those tracks you just spun another foot deeper to get here. Aahhh huuuh. Well that exactly what I do…I stay in Captain’s tracks, white knuckling, arss cheeks pinched tight here I go. Next time I’ll hike up here and get Harry to come air lift me out.","Butt Mountain

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/262284,"This seems to be the year to head out and see a water fall. In the past several weeks we’ve ventured to the local spots and tried to catch them in frozen form or covered with snow and have been successful. A change of plans put us at Dismal Falls yesterday instead of up on Peter’s Mountain. Sure glad too because the winds picked up as the morning progressed.‘Hold still Django you’re running out of your jacket’. Anxious to play in the snow and trot close to Lead Dog’s boots our little four legged friend was covered with snow in no time. Being close to the ground added a snow beard and his curly fur gathered snow balls to weigh his legs bowlegged. What a sight!!The snow flurries blew in our faces as we crossed the side of the mountain heading into the north winds. Our wool hats were pulled down tight and all layers of warmth stayed on all day. 20’s the thermometer read. With snow falling from the rhode thickets as gusts blew, it sure made it hard to keep out of our collars. The falls soon were heard and we took a morning look before heading on our way to Walnut Flats. No frozen falls today but much snow all around making a nice setting within the pines and greenery. We talked of future campouts along the waters edge and other locations to visit. If only we were retired….some will be soon enough and I won’t mention any names. Since Cuddle Dude is our newest hiker on the trail with many miles yet to cover I gave him the option of just how far we’d hike today. I’m always leaving the door open for those double digit days. Smile smile, wink wink. A quick confer with Dotson #2 the decision was to hold at the 7 mile mark which took us to the little bridge close to Walnut Flats. Now this is just a mile or so from where the fellas were camping and Randall Smith tried to kill them. Shots range out as these men ran for their lives this past summer. Glad ol Randall has gone to the devils den now. Enough of that story, back to mine. We stomped a snow dance or three to drum up more of the white stuff to delay school for our hiking teacher but it just didn’t work. So we just soaked up all the enjoyment we could out of what the good lord gave us. Our path ran along the creek just about the whole day and tunnels within rhodes for wind protection, sweet. Then eerie sounds screeched above our heads. Rows and rows of trees sway touching branches like arms reaching for one another’s hands. Creeeak, it’s my granny’s screen door opening out to the side porch I thought. We scurry to get on out of the woods before a tree comes crashing down on us.Closer to the car the snow is just about melted and calmness comes over the trail. We are safe. We are happy to be out here AND we will be back.","Dismal Falls

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/262632,"Today's goal was to beat the weather and that we did, blue blazin the Dickinson Gap trail right up to the AT atop Peter's Mtn. I was wondering if I would be making this trip by myself but then the good lord saw fit to have my phone ring off the hook this morning bringing me a few hiking friends to join me. The boys today are Bruce and Django, Django escorted by Miss Noni. He was a happy pup to know he could still come even with his mama out of town. Noni's short stature was just the call necessary for him to think he was being lead by the same. Me on the other hand might have turned Django into Lead Dog or even worse a drug dog. Blow downs hindered our progress at first with us having to get down on hands and knees to crawl under them. The path is well worn from many footsteps of hunters and hikers alike. Steep in places we catch our breath and notice how calm it still is, ahh the forecasted storm must be just around the corner. The red rock appears just at the crest of the mountain, we have made it in just under an hour. The air is much cooler as fog tries to blow in. Treking along the ridge we can somewhat see to our west towards Lindside WV. Stone Henge awaits. Yes a name I put on this one section where huge rock formations line the trail as it climbs a 1/2 mile or so. Seems like alot more as the white marks continue to show themselves at each false summit. Deja Voo. ""I think I will wait on Noni, a good excuse to rest a minute Lead Dog"" Bruce gasps out. Ahh I have broken yet another follower trying to keep my pace on an upgrade. Gives me great pride in my stride as I smile and disappear into the woods. I know they will be along in their own time and I shall wait at the top as always looking back. What IS that up ahead? Snow, Fog, What? Turned out to just be heavy fog but sure looked like a snow patch along the bank of the hill approach it. Funny how your mind and eyes can play tricks on you. Soon we reach our next junction, the Alleghany Trail. Lunch time and it's only 11:30. I have talked many times of hiking some of this trail but to-date haven't. Sign say 12.4 miles to Waiteville. Seems doable. A swift walk down to Pine Swamp we make. Passing all the switchbacks and groves of teaberry. Yumm. The waters of Pine Swamp branch we hear making it's way to Stony Creek below. A pleasant walk in mossy covered rocks and trees it was. The shelter's roof can be seen like a mirror reflecting sunlight especially with all the bare trees right now. A nice sound structure just waiting for the thru-hikers to come stay the night. With just a quarter mile left from the road we talk of our past work here and some close calls with Yukon Charlie and his work crew. ""Lookout for that big orange monster"" I say. No monsters today just the treat of stormy weather, again weather we missed as we peak out of the woods with sprinkles hitting our faces.","Dickinson Gap/Pine Swamp

Eating county ham sandwiched between two slices of tomato on a hot biscuit. Saaaaluuute! Pass the homemade strawberry preserves too. The firehouse was gettin right busy just about 8am. Good thing we got here when we did. Our bellies loaded and ready to climb Garden Mtn.The rerouted AT takes us no more down Little Wolf Creek but rather walks the road a quarter of a mile then cuts up Brushy Mtn one of our first ascents of the day. The sun has already warmed the morning up nicely. The stripping started rather quickly with Braveheart dropping trou to escape from his long johns. WHAT?? It’s gonna be 70 today boy. Then the LL Bean girls rolled up their fleece lined pants to show off some leg and those stylish knee socks. “I have a pocket knife you know and we’ll turn them pants into shorts right quick!” So here we go-the High Water Gang hiking the High Water Trail. We could see where the old trail came into the fire road and hope to come back this summer to walk it marked or not. Trail whisp and Braveheart announce they will keep it open for us. NICE. Our new hiker, For Now, got in the groove just fine. Decked out in hand me down clothes and sticks she marched right along with us in perfect time. A niece of the family, Britney is a college senior at JMU, lives in Chesapeake For Now, and has her career options open For Now. Is A hiker, For Now, anyway…get the picture? Jenkins Shelter is our half way stop and a nice rest to cool our jets. Still too early for lunch, so we soak up the sun from this blue bird day. “How far to the top Lead dog?” Almost 4 more miles. Our shuttle pick up is scheduled between 1:30 and 2:00, we should just make it. The trail turns up then up then up some more. My hikers are stretched out between one another and our legs feel the burn of Garden Mtn. We begin to meet hikers heading down, a good sign there must be a road not too far now. Three fellas are packed out with ‘the whole house’ it looked like heading for a night at Jenkins Shelter. Then two gals from Buchanan, mother and daughter out for a birthday hike. Too bad, they took the wrong direction and are missing Burke’s Garden. We warn them it’s all down hill from here and hopefully they heed our warning. We are at the top 4000 some feet. My watch tells me so, For Now is impressed with such a gadget. The breeze along the ridge is wonderful. The little town of Ceres is just below and the big Davis Camp Farm to our right. I’ve always wondered how the camping really is down this side trail. Maybe some day I’ll check it out. A large rock formation comes up to our left and nothing doing but ‘The Family’ has to go to the top. JoBo and Gnu trot quickly so not to be left out either. Not so close to the edge I holler out.Moss covered rocks line the trail and lead us to the parking lot. A lot quite full of cars today. WOW. Hootie Hoot, Keith is waiting, it is 2:00. We take in some refreshment and tell him about our day. “My right leg is numb” …..For Now. Returning home by way of the valley drive down 42 refreshes my mind and spirit. I stopped at the little white church of Walker Creek to take a picture. Then the sound of clipity clop I hear. It’s the Amish coming down from out of the mountain. Husband and wife in a horse drawn cart. I throw up my hand to wave but get no response in return. I must be quite a sight my legs showing and all.

Prepared we were to get drenched we only had a light drizzle to contend with early on. Fog draped the ridge lines. The mountains giving off an image like the Loch Ness monster appearing out from the dreary waters it supposedly roamed. Very cool sight indeed. The woods were quiet with only the sounds of water droplets popping off the leaves on the forest floor. The humidity was up as well which kept us rather warm and ready to throw off any extra layers. No doggies with us. Just me and Captain raring to go in whatever weather God gives us. HE was easy on us today. Speaking of easy, what an easy walking trail too. The path was 2 to 4 feet wide and very smooth. We call these types Boulevard trails which make for great hiking times. We covered this 11 mile stretch in 4 hours and 23 minutes. Now we didn’t run by any means and did have some small puds to cross. I can see how the thru-hiker could surely cover 20 miles along this type terrain easily.  Before we knew it we were at Backbone Rock trail junction which is only 4 ½ miles from Damascus and it’s only 11:30. Closing in on town we decided to pull up for lunch. Still expecting rain at anytime we gobbled down our food while talking about our upcoming May trip and hoping for as nice a trail as today. We feel our legs and lungs are much stronger now and ready for days on end hiking and camping. Wonder where we will go next year? North-PA maybe.We see the little town of Damascus while the trail takes us on a new lain path. The local trail workers have relocated the last mile moving it from a direct approach to a few long switchbacks. I see my retirement home.

We must hurry Captain so we can see it set AND get our tents up before dark. The pace quickens as nightfall was fast approaching. Northerly winds picked up bringing a chill in the air. “If you’re gonna take a shot you better do it now”. The sun’s arms stretched across the horizon and then gone in a wink of an eye. Captain and I both cut out of work early this past Friday to run to our trail start, 5 miles below the Rice Fields. Our engines had hardly stopped running as we slapped on our packs and grabbed a dog each heading out for the season’s first overnite. We estimated arriving just at sunset, 2.5 hours. We both didn’t feel like we were carrying bigger packs, must have been the adrenaline AND of course all that work at the gym. We decided to get water at the little spring on the way up and at that time realized what all we had forgotten. Nothing life supporting but still none the less forgotten. Captain left his water bottles in his truck, good thing Nikon carries his on him. I had trail signs made for the upper water supply past the Rice Fields and also tenting signs to go down near Pine Swamp shelter. Guess what, forgot the right ones for our section. Oh well we’ll just have to hike it again and get it right!!!There was no time to watch every last bit of light go from the sky, it’s tenting 101 time. So just how fast can one set up a tent? Does wind have a factor? OH YEAAA. Head lamp on, put on another layer, gloves, READY SET GO. It was like a kid ripping off xmas paper from his packages as I threw my pack open and grabbed my tenting equipment. “Where’s a rock, my tent’s blowing away, Captain!!!! ““Help me Martha, I can’t clip this darn tent leg”Niles and Nikon paced from one tent site to another awaiting a room to run into. Around my tent I go stabbing tent stakes down as fast I can run. What a sight! I roll up inside out of the wind to get more clothes on…ALL I HAD. See I thought I’d just see how I might do with what I plan on taking come the Shenandoah trip. Ya know, test the tolerance level a bit. I WANT MY DOWN BOOTIES!!!The shelter had been turned into a hunters hide away over the winter. Plastic had been hung partially over the entrance, flapping in the wind cut into shreds in places. We collected fire wood and got some heat going. A Va Tech student came in all about the same time we arrived and set his tent up as well and placed his fire pit at his front door. Way to close for my comfort level but he seemed fine with it as he roasted a hotdog while setting in his tent. A tent by the way with NO rain fly over it just the netting set up. Bet that was real warm over the night. Nikon turn, fire walker, racing over to make friends and walked right thru his hot coals. It didn’t seem to bother him even though we could see the sparks on this feet fur. Maybe I should try that to warm up the tootsies. We ate inside the shelter watching our fire go out. Checking my thermometer within my tent, 30, now that doesn’t account for wind chill let me tell ya. My pen won’t write, my music ain’t working, guess I’ll drop off to sleep by the night tunes of Whistling Dixie and Shake Rattle and Roll.Again I WANT MY DOWN BOOTIES!!!. Three pair of socks in and a pack cover wrapped around the end of my sleeping bag. Captain’s feet were cold too and he even had two dogs in with him. Reckon he’d known if I’d snuck in his tent last night to get my feet warm? Shoot just another wet nose and cold paws he’d never known difference. Morning now… Moon-shine while the sun-shines… A nice view looking over Pearisburg from this drafty platform privy. When you gotta go you gotta go man!!! We bust camp as the sun comes up and race for the trail without breakfast. Too cold to wait on that water boil for grub. My water bottle in my tent turned to a slushy overnight and the one outside the tent was just about solid. The trail walked Peter’s mountain ridge all day. The north wind still prevailing we kept long johns on all day only shedding off rain gear used as wind breakers about mid-morning. Coming up to Symm’s Gap we finally have some of that long awaited calmness and spring time sunshine to soak up. We took a break in the grasses of the rolling hills and ate a good lunch much needed after snacking on trail bars to get us thru. Our VT hiker passes us here on his way to Pine Swamp too for the night. Loaded down with a big pack he still has a pop in his step enjoying his own hike.Stonehenge was our only pull for today and was just as I remembered. One rock formation after another with white blazes as far as the eye can see up up up the trail. Now is the only time I wished I had these long johns off. The Alleghany trail sign peaks between the pine branches, only 2.5 miles to Pine Swamp Shelter. We’ve come 11.5 miles and should be there by 3:30, still keeping our 2 mile an hour pace. Teaberry patches line the trail down Pine Swamp. We stop at every switchback to take a taste..yum yum. I hear the creek. With all the rain it’s a full roar. The tin top of the shelter is spotted and our hiker friend is tented out beside her resting in the sun. Cool we have the shelter to ourselves. Food and beverage delivery is to arrive around 4pm. Wish all hikes had this convenience. Well almost all. It sure is nice to come into camp with time to relax, setup and collect fire wood before dark. We will have an outdoor fire AND one inside the shelter with the use of it’s chimney. Our delivery service arrives with enough food for 10 hikers. Short trippers only had quarter of a mile to walk in. Hotdogs, get your hotdogs right here. Cold beer, get your cold beer right here!!! Larry turns Survivorman, sparking his flint stick with his knife to start a fire. Well almost starting a fire. Here use my lighter. Flames a glow…good to be warm. Larry keeps the wood supply up while I rest like a queen. Our cozy cabin is quite a treat like none other I’ve had on the trail. We set and chat while warming our feet by the fireplace.

The winds still blow as the sun is setting. We are tucked tight in the forest. The shelter is a buzz with thru and weekend hikers cooking and making their beds for the night. 8:00PMWe got an early start this morning leaving for TN at 5:30am. Mountain Harbor B&B/Hostel was feeding hikers as we checked in to confirm our shuttle pickup for tomorrow. Breakfast aroma filled the air in the quant country house set up on a hill with a creek running below. The hostel bunk house was a barn for their horses and goats with boarding upstairs. All up hill expected for us today. Southbound we are meeting many hikers with every bald past through. Doll Flats was our first opening, which really wasn’t flat, but a clearing wide with hunter’s spotted just up ahead looking for that turkey to shoot. Hope it ain’t me. Look rhyme atop Hump Mountain, our first summit upcoming at 5500 feet. A blue bird day it is with a chilly southern wind. Funny, shorts and long sleeve tees with gloves on periodically. Now this IS hiking. We are lightly packed. 23.5 lbs. for me and the Captain with yet another new pack, tent and come to find out sleeping bag. Damn he’s an outfitter waiting to open a second hand store. Weighs in at 18 pounds. Check out all the ramps. The small green plants are sprouted everyway. Captain pulls one to just make sure. An oniony taste with a sharp smell when first picked just like a new green onion from the garden. Maybe there will be some near our camp tonight we can add to our pot. Spring to surely just around the corner.The trail is forgiving thus far-climbing yes-but diverting most steep ascents with side skirting trail. Hump Mtn has our 360 degree view. Be careful though or you will lose your hat. Gusts I’d say 25-30 mph. Thank goodness for the sunshine. We pick out Grandfather Mtn and maybe that’s Mt. Mitchell the farthest peak. Field after field with vast views for miles that the AT meanders through. Reminds me of Grayson Highlands. This maybe my prettiest section hiked to date. We meet many hikers mostly heading north and talking about what a cold windy night they spent last night on the trail. Over Mountain shelter was full and howled all night with winds even though nestled deep in a hollow. The big red barn looks very inviting today but we are bound for Roan and pass her by.Osprey packs are the dominant pack today especially for the females. In a short stretch every gal passed had one and red too just like mine. Cool. A Connecticut Gal moves slowly up from the barn, legs looking heavy and tired but she is “gonna try to make it to Maine”. Lots of hikers look very tired and weighed down from their overloaded packs. Things should get better for them I hope.Stan Murray Shelter is just ahead. A real run down place and very old shed setting right on the trail. Heck the picnic table is actually ON the path. A threesome is due to spend the night here boy I wouldn’t. Holy shit, will this climb ever end? The moment we left Stan Murray the trail turns ‘for the worse’. Step after step, knee to your chin. Am I at Stecoah again? By far the hardest climb today. I can see Roan approaching closer and closer. These balds are great for checking your distance covered. Like a carrot out in front of a horse leading us onward. Carver’s Gap will set us with only 1.5 miles to go. I can see the road. I check over my shoulder Captain has disappeared but I know he is only one bald away. Grassy Bald, Jane Bald dotted with hikers like tiny ants moving from ridge to ridge. I take in the view from a rocky spot looking out over the hazy mountains. The surrounding fields covered with patches of red briars standing on end like porcupine bristles. I approach the Gap which a busy place just like our McAfee knob parking lot. Cars parked along the road. Bikers peddling to make it’s crest for a break. I wait briefly for Captain but it is too chilly to set long. Nikon has lagged back with him at this point. He must have heard me talking about taking him from his master as he usually is up with Lead dog. We later suspect he realized where his water source was coming from…his own pack and that Captain would get it for him. Smart doggie. Heading now into the deep dark evergreens I feel a sense of the world closing in on me having walked most of the day in the wide open ridges. Have I stepped into another world? Hansel and Gretel woods with heavy moss covering everything. Glad the AT built bog bridges or this could be really nasty. Speaking of bogs and mud I forgot to tell you about the section over Grassy Bald. It was one black muddy trail, slippery with every step. Noni comes to mind…reckon I’ll have mud to my shins? Noni would. My thoughts are with her and her family today as they will soon lay a beloved brother to rest tomorrow. I remember our trip to Leconte, TN with Jess. He hiked up to meet us on his own and what a great time we all shared around the lodge. Bogs turn to a wet stoney path. Damp and chilly 5:00 the shelter should be just right around the next corner. The next corner NOT, Maybe this is the one, NOT. I am anxious to arrive. Feet are tired and a hot spot or two have come up on my heels. Blue blazes finally!! The shelter trail is here, a knarly stretch too with many high steps from erosion and many years of hikers coming in. A tin roof spotted I have arrived 5:30. Camp spots I search. Survivorman instinct hit me and I spy a big rock area about shoulder high tall which will make a fine wind break for my tent. I’m cooling down and starting to chill so I hurry to set up. Ah warm dry clothes and DOWN BOOTIES. Hootie Hoot, The Captain has arrived. Nikon rushes to my tent to say hello. No fire tonight, too much work. Most of the wood up here is rhododendrons anyway which don’t burn. We grub at the shelter with the others making friends and sharing trail stories. Chicago boys, Squeak, WD-40 and Little Wayne are quite a bunch. I decide to share a little Grey Goose with them as I know I can’t finish it myself with no campfire and certainly don’t want to carry it out. They set the table a fire while cooking their pasta laughing. Captain is huddled deep in the dark shelter which has a door to keep the cold out. The windows it has are glazed over and thick with grit so no light can get in. We set with our head lamps on inside to eat out of the winds. Then the Mountain Boys arrive. 3 local fellas who are “out for a night in them thar woods”. They have hauled a case of beer and who knows what all for night on top of the world, the AT’s highest shelter 6500 feet. I expect they will sleep thru frostbite tonight.8:46. The Captain purs. Soon to be lights out.Noises of the night begin. I feel the trees sway above me. Winds rush thru them but not so bad down here on the ground, weird. Moonlight shins down between the limbs casting passing shadows on my roof. I step out for a night whiz and see the fire flicker. The Mtn Boys are still at it. I tuck back in for sleep. Well almost, what was that? I hear foot steps, is that a saw? Yup they are cutting down saplings for their fire. After three trips for fire wood over a couple hours I finally drift off 12:10.Captain gives his wake up call, Nikon rushes from his tent to mine scratching at the door. Sunrises as we break camp and skip a cooked breakfast so we’ll make our shuttle pick up time at 9:30am. All are still asleep in the shelter. Chicago boys have stacked up packs over the screen vent in the loft of the shelter and the mtn boys were strewn about behind the front door when Captain went in for our bear bag. We have 3.3 miles out today with a beginning climb to the crest of Roan High Bluffs, home of the worlds largest natural rhododendron garden. A chimney remains from the 1800s when a resort was here, Cloudland. The dignitaries would horse and buggy up here and stay in the hotel. For $5 extra you could have a fire place in your own room. Rhodes cover all around with this one patch we stand on is bare. We warm quickly even walking down hill now coming out of all long johns and wind breakers. Nice ass Captain!!! No peaking!!! My heels are still a little sore this morning but not so bad I can’t walk and normal pace. A steep winding trail still knarly like before takes us off of here and I see why the hikers say this is the last major climb going north before the New Hampshire Whites.Breaking finally onto more walkable trail the hardwoods are back and the signs of spring. Ramps again with trout lilies trying to start their buds. Houses are spotted down in the green valleys and soon Sunday hikers are past as we head out and they head in. My knees are starting to really feel this pounding with a1000 feet change per mile. I see the road, our shuttle should be here in 15. Nikon races to the finish line, I drop my pack, my mind races back over the last day. The openness of the trail like none I walked before, the feeling freedom, the excitement of reaching the highest shelter along the AT, I want to come back.","Elk Park 19E

We have been strewn about for too long but we did finally reconnect with just about everyone. An iffy day for rain but rather warm just the same. “Places everyone, pecking order now” Sandra calls out. Lined up like old times Lead Dog leading with my Dotsons 1 and 2 following. The Greyhound catches up with his old friend Cuddle Dude. Feels good to have a good crowd going back to an old place on the trail, the Rice Fields. Seems like I just can’t get enough of her this season having been here 3 times already.Ah the first climb of the day just as I remember….Celanese groans below as we make tracks up the switchbacks adding distance between ourselves. Waiting what seemed to be quite some time at the knoll Bruce and I wander if we should check on them. It’s certainly way too early for lunch only being 9:00ish. What’s that voice I hear? I recognize it, it’s THE Straggler. Harry HAS made it after all. A quick reunion and off we all go.“Are you walking regular pace Lead Dog?” Bruce asks. He’s just keeping a check on his endurance and hiker legs and recalls not usually being ‘right on my heels’ ESPECIALLY on a hill. I actually am loafing a little today so as not to get too far ahead of my pack. I do feel stronger than this time last year. I’ml ready for the upcoming long hike thru Shenandoah next week. We stop for a bit and let a few thru hikers have the right of way. Cresting Peters Mtn we spot a large log just waiting for us to use as a bench. Harry tells us of his skydiving adventures jumping one day 4 times WOW. To me that’s like hiking up to Angels Rest more than once in a days’ time. Wonder how far back they are Bruce says while watching intently on the trail below. Then out of the woods a hiker is spotted, her head down, charging up to us. Sticks drive in the ground to propel her faster and faster. Django’s ears peeled back, tail high like an antenna honing in on his master. Sandra has hit another gear trying to catch up fearing her poor Cuddle Dude will be without food when we stop for lunch. Shortly our last two arrive and announce this IS there lunch stop and turn around point. Heading on toward the shelter it’s quick steppin for the rest of us with the easy walk along the WV/VA ridgeline. We can see the little towns of Lindside and Glen Lynn. Fresh green grass pastures dotted with red tin roofed houses make it look so inviting. Spring is here, small wild flowers line our path, may apple, violets and trout lilies. It’s not long before reaching the openness of the Fields. Bruce takes it all in as this is his first time here. We elect to set along the edge and have lunch looking off into WV. NIIICE it is. Still warm with cloud cover AND no wind. I can’t believe it, the wind always blows up here. Sandra treats us to some homemade pound cake which is just the icing on the cake to a lovely day. We wonder if the early out two are still waiting for us at the bottom as we trek back to the trucks. We smell the rain forecasted but only feel a drop or two. Hope we can out hike it. Turning the corner of the mountain coming off the southern side warmer air greet us. Wow what a difference. I have to come out of a layer HOT. The knees are starting to really feel the descent off and with all the rock steps they do take a pounding.Crossing the creek I hear a thump thump of a drum and pop of a beer can. They are still here. Truck windows down, arms resting out the windows, our short trippers are cooling it by the tunes of Waylon, Willie and the Boys. So we gather around once again to talk trail and enjoy each other’s company until will catch up again some day.","Rice Fields

We’ll have a pack dual to see who’s weighed in at what pound which I’m sure I will lose. Sure is fun trying to keep up with the ‘master’. Light or not he’ll have to keep up with Lead dog just the same. Covering 161 miles in 13 days seems like a lot but just a day hike a day. The weather is warming nicely if we can just avoid those thunder storms. We have two resupply stops: My mom and dad at Skyland Lodge Day 6 then ShortCut and Gypsy at Manassas Gap day 10. Finally we’ll pull off the trail in Harpers Ferry at the conjoining of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers meeting up with LeftTurn Leon, our shuttle home.Again I will try to post a little note on Trail Journals so ya’ll can see how we are coming along.","Rockfish Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/272997,"Tucked in my sleeping bag I try to write. The Doctor is still just a chattering up a storm. Sharp Tooth, a thru-hiker comes into camp at dusk 8pm. He is heading north and who knows we may just be along with him for some of his trip. A graduate from University of GA and from a town close to Springer, he started in March. For protection he has fashioned a spear out of a long stick with a screw on jagged knife blade. Oh and carries a blow gun too. He must be expecting some fierce animals in these parts.Finally the shelter turns quite, just drops of rain pecking on the tin roof the only sound.We got on the trail at 12:20 today after a Burger King power lunch. The trail was rather easy but wet slippery. A little grade to start from Rockfish Gap up to the kiosk sign in. We tag my pack for the both of us. Our adventure has officially begun.It rained like hell driving here but only showers on us now. Fog rolls past like ghosts flying about. We talk our way to the shelter solving all the world problems and some of our own. Open fields are cool and viewless. I’ll cross this fence using the ATC stile while Captain decides to scale over by way of a gate. Look out don’t knock the nads on it’s cold iron!!!We cross the Skyline drive 2 times with an approach for me a safe slide into McCormicks Gap. Mud coats my left butt cheek. Drats, there goes staying clean for a least one day! No rain gears needed really. Warm enough at 70 but temps drop as the evening closes.Wonder how many thru hikers will be at camp? We have decided best not to tent. Gonna be wet and no sense in having to tote a wet tent in the morning. Captain is purring, 8:21. Radio on NPR and he’s out. That’s what that shit does to me too man. OUT. The doctors who were already here when we arrived are quite entertaining. Conversation covering gyno visits, happy health and “say doc just how does that operation work?” See these two cats are a father son Dr. Duo. Dad being a gynecologist and son finishing up his studies in medicine soon to be ship off to Iraq. “Say guys I need to change from these wet clothes turn your backs” “ Oh never mind I’m a doctor” Wonder how many times dad’s used THAT line?We chat for hours, what laughs you can image. They had extra food for an army with this being their last night out. So they share hot tea and ginger snaps. Sharp Tooth snatches up candy bars for himself. “Say Captain, Where’s that weather report?” Again the radio is chatting but no weather report tonight 11:00.Looking for this trip for almost a year now I can’t believe I am out here now. This is looking like a real rain event and will give me a good testing for the first time. I’ll see if I can stomach it. Overlooks? What am I missing out there? Tomorrow only knows.","Rockfish Cap

The Captain is purring already. Yep he’s out just like last night. He can sleep thru it all. Me on the other hand had a restless night. New trail name is RUSTLE cause that’s all I did. Tossed with excitement I guess. I miss my tent comforts. We’ll see how I do another night in a house of many men. Sharp Tooth walked with us today saying he’d enjoy the leisurely pace for a change. WHAT? I’m walking a good 2+ miles and hour man! That’s nothing for him, he’s averaging 20+ miles per day with the most in one day of 36. He demonstrated his blow gun last night with the boys. Captain asked what he was protecting himself from and the answer was bears and wild cats.The fog is really socked in today. Overlooks are none. I’ve decided to take a new ‘forced’ perspective of the trail. MY FEET!! Yes with the eyes down I’ve checked out every flower along the trail and then some. Pink Flaux and little purple flowers line the way. Hot pink flame azalea. The rain also has lessened the pollen too. 50's for temps so not too hot while moving and keeps the water consumption down so traveling with a little less water weight. Heck I still have the same water in my platypus I left home with. I just added a little to my nalgene bottle at the shelter last night. A tad of my evening beverage along with orange crystal light makes for a nice cocktail with supper.My feet are turning a little sore but no blisters. Walking at this fast pace pounds them in my boots which I’ll just have to endure. Speaking of fast pace... The Captain puts some quick talk on the young man telling him his many words of wisdom. #1 Never give the same gift to two separate women#2 Always tell them THEY are the BEST you ever had#3 well I forgot #3 but I’m sure it had a 4th and 5th to followWatch out for that tree, Captain!! You’ll drag bag again. Just one of the few draw backs from sporting a Kelt as a man. Sharp Tooth leaves us now planning on hiking past our hut stop tonight and going to the next one. Totting along out in front of Captain I crack off a few trail sounds of my own. He’s unaware of the vibrations he’s about to walk right into as he has his headphones on listening to music. Wow I think I killed a bird!!We decided to start counting road crossing instead of switchbacks. 2 yesterday and 6 today. One slight sighting of a valley today but it was soon washed away with a see of grey. We hike on me looking forward to a warm bath. Yes, that’s right. I’m gonna heat up some water in my cook pot and bird bath it. Can’t you just see my big arss fitting in it now?The hut roof is spotted just below us. Kinda hope we are alone for a while. I sure could use a nap. I see bare feet hanging out from under a sleeping bag. It’s Sharp Tooth taking a breather before hiking his OTHER 13 miles for the day. WOW. I get my bath and we nap, lovely. Clothes are trying to dry as we rest. Here I set now huddled back in our rock house. Threatening rain so all are sheltering instead of tenting. Warm I am nestled in my sleeping bag writing. The bees are still buzzing eating supper and trying to keep our made fire going. Again I look forward to tomorrow. Thunderstorms. Maybe some sun will shine on us. I already miss her.","Calf Mtn Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273009,"Ahh here I set resting my body against a towering pine behind our hut for the night. Captain and a hiker are napping. I took a 15 minute power nap but awoke chilled from sweat so I took another ‘hot’ bath and feel much better now.We all woke early this morning 5:30 or so. I slept great turning off my music at 10pm. All the boys were bunking down about then too. A quite bunch too with no restling or snoring much. The 4 of them had clocked 20+ miles again and scattered as we left too. No fog to greet us just overcast skies with a smell of rain in the air. An overlook approaches appropriately named Blackrock as our hut was last night. Rock is all around just like Devil’s Marble Yard except here the AT runs around the mountain cutting right thru it’s side. We can see out!! But look, a valley of fog rest below just inching its way up to us. Smooth path for walking now. A graded nicely for level footing. We make good time again trekking off 6 miles before 10am. Loft Mountain we are running, nearly 4 miles the AT meanders its ridge amongst dead locust trees and very little vegetation. Dreary.We meet several day trippers and backpackers out for a few nights, passing them at each foggy turn. Yes the white blanket returns. Two fellas we met yesterday are back again asking if we remembered their biscuits and gravy. The are hiking south covering sections with a car at each end. One knew Miss Tilly Woods - she sat behind him a the local Roswell GA church. Small world.Golden rod reappears along the trail down to Ivy Creek. A wonderful walk in the woods it is now. Short lived too as threatening rain runs us off from a nice lunch stop @ a PATC cabin with spring and picnic table. I miss those hour lunch breaks soaking up some sun and drying our my socks and resting my feet. Not much fun trying to sleep with rain popping you in the face. Da Plane Da Plane...Is it Harry? He said he might do a fly over one day and throw out an orange streamer to us. I’ve heard several planes go over but way too much fog to see and surely he wouldn’t fly in this?Specks of sunlight cast on me here by my big pine tree. Peaceful it is. The creek running behind me. A fine place to camp. However a thunderstorm is possible tonight, we shall hit the hut again.7:05pm Just 3 in the shelter tonight. New Shoes, a hiker who stayed with us last night has held up. The new shoes he bot in Waynesboro are a ½ size to small he says. Blisters have shut him down from his 20 mile days. He says the big mils are taking the fun out of it. He is from Manassas so home is not to far if he decides to come off the trail for a break.We should have a peaceful night with the creek singing us to sleep. Yes Captain is already fluttering and in more ways than one now.   We talked about our options on miles coming up tomorrow. Stealth camping is on the schedule but with bad weather still about we may push on to a hut. We’ll just have to see. 14.6 may turn into 17 or 20 to the next shelter. Until then....","Blackrock Hut

I’ve had a quick bird bath in the ladies room of a wayside picnic ground but have to put back on hiking clothes because we aren’t sure where we can hide. We could hide from the Straggler though!!Yes Harry has tracked us down once again meeting us with about 20 minutes left on our day’s journey. Searching all around a non-camping area for a discrete place isn’t easy but we found a spot just over the hill’s edge out of sight. The boys have gone on a store run. Captain has cut himself short on snacks and needed reinforcements. I elected to stay behind and rest my body which is pretty tired from not sleeping well.We had just talked about a pack of nabs and an orange soda when here came along the trail magic man. Ole Harry could find a needle in a haystack. We arose early once again departing by 7AM Leaving new shoes still tucked tightly in his sleeping bag. Another humid day each getting warmer with a few more views but usually by 9:00 the white blanket come rolling over us. Captain is on his 3rd day without a dip. He finished off his can of Kodiak the first short day licking the container clean. On top of that he is recovering from a broken heart but hey it ain’t nothing a little duct tape can’t fix.We meet the biscuit boys again as they are making their way south as we got north. Each visit we learn more about one another and trek on our separate directions. The trail is lined today with geraniums and purple flowers. The park isn’t as pretty of a forest as you’d think. Young trees and no under growth, guessing fires have done most of the damages. Climbs, Climbs, This is hiking. The trail turns true AT on us with little relief. I press on stopping none on the long grades methodically picking up my boots wondering if my legs are really moving me. I peek over my shoulder, Captain charges behind me. A man “in shape” he is.Two good views as we approach Hightop Mtn our lunch break. Finally a shelter to eat at on the way. Covering 8 miles each day by 11am works up quite the appetite. Soaking wet from sweat and humidity we gobble down our food wishing for another round. We now have the hiker hunger.I keep forgetting to tell you about the bear towers here in the park. Not bear cables but a tall metal post way up high with hooks to hang your food bag on. You place your bag on another pole with its hook and push it up to the tower hooks and hang. Awkward at first try too. Other trail news is ticks are out. Each of us had one crawling up our legs earlier to today. Yikes and no real showers to check all the nooks and crannies either. We found a merkel today. You know those sponge looking mushrooms your granny used to fry up for ya? We were gonna cook it with our supper tonight but with Harry’s magic have held it for hard times. All have settle to our tents now. The local deer have come by several times to check on us. Hope that’s all who comes by-Bear-Park Rangers. Both could be bad at 2:00AM.We have a big day tomorrow 17.5 miles to cover. Hope my heels hold up. Quite sore but already feel better after some relaxation. I’m sure Captain will press me again and see what I’m worth or better said what he’s worth.","Pinefield Hut

Had the most rain so far on our trip.It started last night about 1:00 with a pop pop on my tent like jiffy popcorn over a fire. Then there was the fighting owls which sounded like we were in some deep jungle in the Amazon. I was warm though and dry in my tent. Slept like a baby.With Harry coming in we had some fun trail talk while the night fell - no watching the sun go down - just the fog rolling in and local wild life checking in on us. Up and at’em like ‘normal’ 5:30am. Normal being a relative word right Harry? The showers held off allowing us to pack tents and gear without fighting getting wet. With Nabs to go and a battery charge on the ol cell phone we were off by 7:00. Thanks Straggler for the way cool magic!!!Not far along the cold wet clothes had to go and a shelter stop was called for. We ate hot cooked oatmeal and ditched wets tops for dry ones and put on all rain gear. We’d been able thus far to stay warm without our suits and were using them actually for stops as an extra dry layer to keep from cooling down to quickly and chilling but not today. I stripped off wet tops and let the puppies run free. Heck if the boys can dangle so can the pups. Next stop Hazeltop Mountain, the second highest elevation in the park. Wish I could have seen it!!! Can you hear the anxiety in my voice?   I’m missing ALL these wonderful views after climbing all the way up here. DAMN. I totally forgot about my heels at this point. Too wet to think about it and with 17.5 miles of this my mind was on finishing. The liquid band-aid sealer does really work by the way. Plastered it on last night sealing up any blisters trying to start.The trail turned generously flat for miles allowing us to clock 2.5 miles per hour. Quite nice even in these elements. New spring grass lined the trail and with the haze made it brighter green than normal. Passing Tanner Cemetery the head stones came and went right before our eyes as waves of heavy clouds drifted by.Big Meadows, we are bound to for lunch, our 12 mile mark. Maybe a camp ground will have a shelter we can eat under. There it is a building we check it out. Hey the bathrooms have those air dryers for your hands. Bing, the light bulbs go off, we race to our appropriate stales and begin air drying ourselves. Zooom the buttons go on and off for several minutes, each cycling like we were trading off our turns. The air wasn’t quite hot enough to dry everything but did well enough to make a wet shirt more comfortable. Now this is thru hiking!!!All I can think about is getting to Rock Springs and into dry night clothes. Even better getting to Skyland to meet my folks. A fellow is here headed to GA finishing his journey started a few years back. Connecticut Curtis I called him. Then a thru hiker comes just before dark. Has hiked 33.8 miles. WOW.

Yes brazen mice scampered about but none ate into our packs or jumped on our sleeping bags. They talked between themselves chattering “there’s nothing to be found, there’s nothing to be found”.

Getting on the trail at 8:30 we made tracks covering our 10.5 miles with loads of day light still left. We both looked at one another and said “7 more miles ain’t nothing, Let’s do it”. Heck we walked the previous 17.5 miles in the rain the other day why not now while it is dry? Having a day to dry out-magic dust in Captain’s shoes (talc powders from mom) and me loaded up with magic beans to help my aching feet we were fortified and ready to roll.

Then Little Stoney Man, the Pinnacles, Marys’ Rock. Why, they are just rocks in the white abyss now. I shall come back and just see them all on day hikes anyway I think to myself.Thornton Gap is below us now. Mom and Dad should have already hit this junction and heading home now.

Only the cement park pillars to lead us thru the fog. The park doesn’t use trail signs but rather cement pillars with a metal strip noting trail destinations and mileages between. These were nicely spaced too to keep you informed of your progress.Today the Shenandoah’s opened herself up to us. WE CAN SEE….the valley, the green mountain ranges, and populations below. I can’t believe how much better I feel. Days of rain, drying out over and over, a hug from mom and day. GOOOOD!!!Sweating,,,ah now this IS hiking. Elkwallow bound. Breakfast at 9:00. We know we will arrive early by 8:30 but the extra 30 minutes will give us time to clean up a bit and reload on water. I’m still doctoring my heels with the New Skin liquid and it’s a dream. Down goes an egg muffin loaded with sausage and cheese along with tators on the side AND that famous blackberry milkshake. Yummie. Now we are ready for another big day. We check the map and it will be too soon to stop at the scheduled Gravel Spring shelter. Let’s make it a 20+ mile day and hit Tom Floyd. Oh yeah that will put us 1 day ahead of schedule.Stats: Park AT miles = 95. We have covered these is 5 ¾ day. That’s almost 17 miles per day. Most thru hikers average 100 miles per week. We ain’t far from that.Average wake up time = 5:30. End time 4 or 5:00. That’s hiking a FULL day, Hey?Today, our longest day = 21.9 miles. Yep and my feet are telling me so. I could feel my heart beet in them when we finished.7:44PM Down for the count. SPENT. Captain is out for the night. We shares this shelter with 2 other section hikers. A new shelter however not placed well at all, in a rock pile and small and has a leaky tin roof we are informed. When we arrived you could hardly talk to one another for the noise it made with the pelting rains. We are scattered in four corners so the drops don’t hit us. No rain now but before – WOW. This shelter has a nice deck but not usable guess why? It’s wet. We tried to beat the rain but no luck. Caught us with 2 miles left on our day. We ran into an Englishman sectioning who said he hiked 56 miles in 2 day. WHAT? No way. Then later a guy from NH who was on his last section from here to Taylors Mtn Overlook new Roanoke. He flip flopped many places on the AT and he will be all done in a few weeks. With the sunny skies trying to give us a boost today we talked about coming back and ‘really’ seeing the Shenandoah mountains. Do day hikes to all those scenic spots that were whited out on us. We did see deer every day but no bear sightings.   A black snake about 6 feet long startled the B-Jesus out of me. Captain nudged his tail (the snake’s tail that is) and he slithered on across the trail so we could pass.7:58PM Here comes the rain again. Isn’t that a song? Wind. Time to nestle down in my bag, a tried trail gal I am. Who knows how long we’ll go tomorrow. It all depends if we can reach ShortCut and Gypsy by phone and move our resupply stop up a day.","Byrds Nest Day Hut

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273312,"8:00PM Just us 2 in the shelter for the night..so we think. I was hoping for a quite house. Still missing my tent and having to shelter it due to surrounding storms. Had 2 pass over us today. At least warmer now which may be due to lower elevations. Today was our wettest trail thus far with water standing inches in the way. My boots sinking over the edges and Captain’s shoes disappearing in the soupy mess. We left Floyd shelter regular time 6:15 having a good nights rest despite wondering if the leaky roof would get us. The roaring rain pounded the roof. Gusts of winds howling. Great it’s all drowning out the snoring. HHAA I could see the lights of some town for the first time in 7 days as my eyes closed for the night .My feet hurt soo bad this morning it left my sluggish trying to force them to my normal pace. Each step throbbed as my heels touched the back of my boots. Even with the nasty trail I wished for my tennie shows. Will I make it this 14 miles? Heck, will I make it to lunch?Ah time for rain once again. Pack covers on but warm enough to trek on without rain gear. Have found rain gear is best at camp since evenings are cool. Use them for a dry layer of warmth.Jim & Molly Denton shelter was one of the best I’ve seen. We stop here for an early lunch and foot repair. A large seating are out front like a deck with benches. A covered picnic area AND a solar shower near the spring. Cold shower today however.   We take a long lunch drying out and resting.A hiker comes in we’ve seen a day back. It’s Unplugged from Vermont. He will be at his 1000 mile mark today. He’s headed for one shelter beyond us today.Catching my second wind I march off to Manassas Gap. The mud smacks beneath my feet throwing spackle up my legs.   I’m sure Noni would have been proud. Her mud slung to the knees!! The trail finally veers from marsh lands for higher ground crossing large green hills. The sun pops out, YES FINALLY!!!We start to dry out as we walk. Rain wet turns to sweat wet. The woods open like a fresh spring day. Geraniums, trilliums all about our landscape. I spot a Jack in the Pulpit too. This feels like hiking today. My drive to be here IS still alive. Bound for Manassas Gap Shelter and I hope we have it alone since this trip has been almost tentless some quite at bedtime would be nice.Unplugged is here at the shelter having lunch along with 2 south bounders. They discuss if the passing storms will hold them here or not. I’m ready for them to move on myself. It’s bath time for me man. The two do so while unplugged gives the north another look while storm #3 goes on past. He departs.For once we can set on our front porch and look out into the blue skies. What a sense of calmness. No worries, the day is complete. A day coming full circle. Can I make it? To Where am I trekking next?","Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/273313,"8:14PM Hard to believe we aren’t dog tired having hiked 14 miles today. Must have been that layover by Ashby Gap that gave us the pick me needed. We arrived in the Gap at 10:56 early yes. Scheduled rendezvous with Shortcut and Gypsy was Noon.Last night was an interesting one to say the least. Didn’t start that way but ended with a lady of the night dropping in. I had just stopped writing and an image appeared over my shoulder. A female voiced sighed. “Boy am I glad to de here” She had left her car just back 2 miles or so and walked in to this shelter for the night. It was longer than she remembered. She thru-hiked in 1999 and some other years. I’d say she was 60ish with an unsteady voice as if she was scared. But turns out not scared as scared as sounded just a jittery kind of voice.   Packing a light sleeping bag, jacket and extra hiker food, she told us stories till we dropped off to sleep. We said our good byes this morning learning she had lived in Pipers Gap just over the hill from me in Carroll County USA. Maybe we’ll see Dana “Jason’s Mom’ again some day.What a wonderful day to hike! We could see the sunrise YES. NO fog, NO rain, NO pack covers for the first time in 9 days. Trillium was abundant on both sides of the trail. The whole mountain covered. We stopped at mile 5, 8:11AM. Yes 2 hours and a tad to walk 5 miles, we are getting faster by the day. Checked out an unusual shelter called Dick’s Dome. A dome it was rounded tall building like a pod you’d see in a space show. Holds 4 hikers. 6 could squeeze in but not likely. We ran into Unplugged again, he’s heading to Bear’s Den our lunch stop for tomorrow. Oh he had passed Cascade some time ago and stayed with the Witcher’s in Daleville. He doesn’t think she’ll finish. She’s way into Pogo and not so much the trail. A family pushed event possibly more so than her really wanting to do this. Also met 2 hikers Caribou and Just Tyler who we’ll shelter with tonight based on our schedules. Both are slow and steady hikers going pretty much shelter to shelter.Sky Meadows, what a great section. 32.8 miles to Harper’s Ferry a sign tells us. Miles of open fields we walked. Captain opens up the jets and airs out the sneakers. “Look out, Martha will lose her trail name” Caribou shouts out. The entrance to the meadows surrounded us with the aroma of sweet nectar. Autumn Olive Captain called it. A bush with tiny flowering leaves giving off a lovely scent like honeysuckle.Ashby Gap, I can’t wait to get there now. The field turns down down down. My toes ache but my heels are relieved they aren’t pushing up some hill. If ain’t one thing it’s another. Who said that?We cross the highway and find a grassy area to lie down. A clothes line goes up, damp clothes flapping in the wind as traffic whizzes by. Ah yes we are the traveling gypsies camped along the side of the road. 11:00, 12:00, 12:30 Where are our girls? A truck pulls up. A trail angels gives Captain a ride to get cell service so we can call them. Ah ha they are up the trail ¼ of a mile at the trail parking. Dang they’ve been there since 10:30. Who would have known?Ah good ol fashioned diner food. The Blue Skillet what a treet. Captain spotted it on the truck ride and directs our resuppliers that way. Double Cheeze Please. A 1 pound burger downed with a fork it was so big. Way to go Captain. Steak and Cheese sub loaded and a size of greasy spoon fries to give ya cardiac arrest in 2 bites. GONE!!! Thanks to our trail angels Gypsy and Shortcut for changing their schedules to meet ours!!! What a treat.Fresh socks to go and now a heavy pack. We are off 3.6 more miles to Rod Hollow. I’m gonna give some of this shit away I say. Too much food. We both had leftovers from the last section and now this section we are loaded again. Get your tuna, getcha Enertia, come and get it!!!A creek runs right before we get to the shelter. Looks like a bathing hole to me. Shower time is comin. Hot Hot afternoon, 70’s for sure. Sweat, Sweat. Better than rain we I tell ya. Caribou and Tyler are here. We spend till dark getting to know one another and telling trail stories. A great ending to a much needed exciting day.

Your legs are in automatic, just keep pumping girl. Hallelujah!! We left out this morning knowing we have the roller coaster to tackle. 17.8 miles of 13 mini mountains to climb. This was my kind of hiking today. One hill at a time is all I kept saying. Seeing almost to the top 300 feet, 400 feet then down down down to a hollow over and over. One Two, One Two, keep the rythem. Feet are fine legs are strong! I’m out in the Lead. Captain fades out of sight listening to his radio. Come to find out he’s taken a fall on slippery rocks. Bent his hiking pole and knocks the wind right out of himself.Each hollow ran full with water. Almost flooded. Columbine was the only flower spotted along the way. The path turns very rocky. Picking up your feet a must to keep from stumping your toes. My mind wanders thinking ‘I’m sure glad to experience “this” now and not the fog section at this time.” To have this great weather and views to look forward to is great. I’d hate to have had all the great weather at first and try to finish with nothing but fog and rain would have left my quite empty.8:51PM is the time I’m writing about today. Setting on our front porch, feet up on the railing. Way cool. I have to say I am ready to see home. 12 days out here is great but a piece of home is needed too! Captain and I are bonded for life from our trips and this one only solidifies it even more.Lunch stop earlier was at Bear’s Den. Scheduled arrival time noon. I got in at 11:15, 5 hours and 11 minutes. Better than ½ of the coaster is done. Wew. Thanks to Harv 59, a south bounder carrying a 50 pound pack. He gave me the hikers combination to the door out back. Once in- 50 cent drinks, $3 shower, internet and phone. Damn no pizza, the main lodge isn’t open. Only open from 8am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm. Too many tourist otherwise to run it during the day. Folks are spotted all around out for a day’s stroll, 11:54 now.I kick off my boots, eat lunch and have a shower on the Den. Checking my feet I thank new skin and body glide. They did the trick on my feet. Oh works well on butt cracks too. LOL Captain arrives and joins in on the den’s amenities and down a couple of sodas. We make a phone call of two, dry sweaty clothes and are off to finish the coaster. What a finish it was too, hard ups over rocks rocks and more rocks. Crossing the Devils Racecourse was only the start of a none stop rock escapade up to the ridge. Then the ridge walk was forever, a good 4 miles or so with me eager to reach the Blackburn sign.No one was at home at the Blackburn Trail Center. Not open yet but we are welcomed by signs posted to make ourselves at home. With a fire in the wood stove of the hiker hostel building and this front porch I’m in heaven. Clothes are drying once again hanging along the rafters. Had a bath out by the big rock center house. Captain split wood and I gathered kindling from the landlords shed as it was called. We both say this place need to be shared with our loved ones some day. A hiker comes in. A young boy 17. I recognize him from the Bear’s Den. He was using the computer when I arrived. His parents had ‘dropped him off’ 4 days ago. I asked him trailname which he responded was butter. Given to him because of his blonde hair working at a local pool. Heck son, your parent dropped you off it should be DROP OFF and so it was. His destination is the NY line starting from Front Royal. His folks have never hiked or packbacked before either no he. They did the research on the AT and bot gear for him. They loaded him up on morning for a ‘drive to breakfast’. He said he knew something was up when the trip turned into a 3 hour drive and his dad said, eat up big son. Kind of like his ‘last breakfast’ you might say. This will cover 400 miles of the AT. He swallowed up the challenge and here he is. And we thought we had a tough trip!","Rod Hollow Shelter

We have bunks and a place for a private shower. Barb here is a great lady and enjoys hearing hiker stories and tells us of some other’s encounters on the trail.We left BTC by 6:15 me looking back at this place wanting to some day to own just this setting. Some day maybe.Expecting an easy walk to town turns pretty much to be true at first. We blistered the first few miles of ridge walk on the wide trail. Our prettiest sunny day too. Foliage is full and vibrant the greens glistening with sun light. Moving down toward civilization I keep thinking about a shower and fresh smelling clothes. Coming in early Larry will not be here till tomorrow, I will spare him the grudge. What happened? The trail takes a mead turn on us. Rocks again. My feet can’t take much more of this. I go into a zone, high stepping, stumping toes, ouch, over and over. I tell myself it won’t be long. Keys Gap 6 miles done, 6 more to go. I hear the traffic on the Shenandoah bridge, we are close. My knees ache with each stride heading off the ridge to the cut of the rivers. Look kayakers riding out the swirls of the river as we cross into Harpers Ferry. A snake slithers from his sunny rock when I approach the steps up from the bridge the trail turning back into the woods running the out skirts of town.I can tell you from experience every couple of approaching END miles seem to leave you mixed with emotions. Stages are: Spent = I can’t wait to stop and dropStoked = I can’t wait to get there, quicken the paceAnd so the stages go..Look Harpers Cemetary, Look Jefferson Rock, Look the confluence of the Shenandoah and the Potomac Rivers..

Wow have we had some great food and also ran into a few hikers we met along our journey who are still in town for some R and R.The Cannonball was our first feeding after finishing yesterday. A Greek owned hole in the wall which we accessed from the back door then letting us walk right thru their kitchen into the small seating area. Look Big Boots, we met him at Blackrock Hut, day 2. I choke down a whopping quesdilla pilled high beef, veggies and chez, homemade salsa and a fresh salad. Last night setting on the porch of the Inn looking down on main street we spot none other than DropOff. He had picked up a pizza coming into town and was coming our way. We chatted as night fell and then watched Dances With Wolves, a movie he’d never seen. Well I made it almost half way thru and then faded out to by bunk about 10:30.He left out mid-day headed for NY as instructed. We in the mean time checked out the ATC headquarters. We got our snap shot put in the log book. Each is numbered and color coded to note what type of hiker you are. Thru NorthBound, Southbound, Section, FlipFloppers. They had a whole wall full of notebooks for each year. We spent hours in there browsing around. We recognized hikers from our trip, Canada, Peter, Sharp Tooth, Sunny (Texas), No New Shoes though he must have dropped out. We even saw photos of previous year 2008 hiker who we saw in GA last season who had finished. Pretty cool.We then checked out the Harpers Ferry Outfitters and wouldn’t ya know hikers recognized Captain and then figured out who I was without my hat. It was the boys from Roan Mountain. Yea you’re the gal that gave us some Grey Goose. Small world even on a 2,175 mile trail. Back at Comfort Inn we run into Caribou. Yep our hiker friend from Maine. We ask him to join us for dinner at the Secret Six. It was nice to reminisce with him and talk about Maine and the trail up that way. He lives right close to Katahdin and has hiked her and surrounding trails many times. Larry and he talk golf too which could work out for a nice vacation for us all next Sept. Captain give Caribou a ride up to Boonesboro so he can slack pack back into Harpers from the North, walking 17 miles. I think that will be his longest yet.

Captain did have more to come in yesterday. Anything that was left over is gone now. They ordered pizzas in addition and had another beer run last night. We kicked off the event at 11:30 firing up the grill burning thru 90 hamburgers and who knows how many hotdogs. Sides from potato salad, beans and desserts cleaned out by night fall. The hikers stuffed themselves washing down everything with sodas and brews. Games were a big hit this year. Corn hole (bean bag toss game), volleyball, and a golf chip off. Tents filled the yard, clothes drying on the line, hiker kept coming in. Mostly accessing the party from the zip line across Stony Creek. The creek was rolling too. Up a good three feet.First a pack would be clipped in for it’s ride over then a hiker would follow. A fun ride indeed. The camp fire soon was a blaze with a little country boy fire starter and all gathered around to wind down the evening. Then it came…One hell of a storm rolled in about 3am. A light show it was from the tent. Boom the ground shakes then it came…Rain Rain Rain. Waives of water pelting us and filling the creek up even more. Some rain for ‘other’ cover while the rest rolled on over and fell back to sleep.

The grass tickles my feet, socks airing in the humid breeze, atop Snowbird Mountain. I wait on my hiking companions 1:00pm. I already checked out the FAA tower and I have made a make shift flag from my orange bandana tied to my hiking pole and lashed it to a trail post. This way they can find me just over the ridge taking in my first mountain range view. I count 7 ridges as far as I can see even on this hazy day.Flame azalea, a few Rhodes and mountain laurel are spotted on this climb out of Standing Bear Farm. I am sure Shortcut and The Captain will crash here beside me just as I did and rest.Speaking of crash lets backup to yesterday. We depart from my house, Captain and I, heading for the farm eta 7:30. Making good time we decide to stop and eat before the TN line. Down goes our Wendy’s meal, loaded back in the little orange Honda, we strap in and head for the interstate. BAM-the seat belt grabs, necks snap forward and a license tag goes flying. We have just T-Boned a car that has been waved across traffic in front of us. I catch my breath as most of it has been knocked out of me. Captain exclaims, “Aint this a way to start a trip, I just got it out of the shop today. The paint aint even dried yet!” A young boy steps attolled from his car. Blank with words and expression. No one is hurt just shook up. Our packs have traveled the full length of the hatch and are resting atop my cooler. My ditty bag I wear around my neck has been thrust off into the floor between my feet. Our minds race “We can get a rental car” “I will call White Crow and tell him we’ll be late” We are still a comin to that trail. A nice policeman comes, no ticket for the young man just settle with insurance he says. Some hand shakes and we are back on our way.Arriving at Standing Bear at 9pm White Crow has his car ready for us. Yes it is a head lamp walk in the woods tonight but only 9/10’s of a mile to the shelter. We pick up our backpacking permit and are dropped off…see you noon Sunday.The trek in was thick mud from horses traveling this section. It’s only a short distance from several horse camps around Big Creek ranger’s station. Yuk. Yes horses can come into the smokies but no dogs, go figure. The night is heavy with humidity, bugs dive at our faces, gooo to the light. Sweat drips from our noses. A rock structure appears, this shelter is caged in to protect us from bears or to keep those from escaping – you pick! We are the only ones here. A quite night, no mice, pitch dark and no weird night noises. Leaving late 7AM LOL we hike on south to Chestnut Branch side trail and about face to meet Shortcut at the farm. Walking back down we realize we sure did climb last night. I’m already sweating again. Not long we pass over the Pigeon River and are back close to the farm. There she is standing at our road crossing pack on and ready. We check supplies one last time and are off again. 5 miles down 9:40am, 7.7 more miles to go.8:27AMTents are placed by the creek. A guitar tune sounds from the shelter above us. Night falls. I write…The trail today was mostly up. Shortcut announces right off the bat, “I’ll be along when I get there” See you at Snowbird about 1:30, no problem. This will be our lunch stop. I soon lose sight of them.What’s this a mowed clean trail? Yep “The Sisters” have come thru here. They are in their 70’s and have taken it upon themselves to make this trek a bit more pleasurable for all. Nettles are everywhere but not along this path. Thaaank YOU. The heat is very intense as I make it up each 500 feet stopping more often than I can ever recall before. The stream crossing helps as I wet my dew rag and cool my head and face. A fuel stop for cheese and a slim jim was much needed. I leave a snack for my buds too, I move on.Once at Snowbird Mountain the trail leaves the cover of the woods and opens up to cleared fields. The heat rolls up in my face WOW. Fence posts lead me to the top.After lunch we only have 2.5 miles to Groundhog Shelter. Back into the woods it’s an easy walk down winding along the switchbacks. We talk of a creek shower and how we can’t wait to cool off. The smell of smoke is in the air we must be close to the shelter. Two hikers are here. Shortcut announces this hike was just enough for her and we agree at 13.7 for us we can tell it’s been month since we last hiked. My feet are great. No hot spots or aching. I love these ruby red slippers. Tents go up and it’s shower time!!! We entertain the shelter two with squeals filling the woods as cold water is dumped over our heads. Man it feels good to cool off. A rumble or twelve moves around us while having supper. The storm is a ridge away and keeps going. We chat about our day and what’s to come. Close hikes to complete and Katahdin afar. We venture up to the shelter to hang our food bag for the night and talk with CumShot and his dad. Yes that’s his trail name, got it when he popped a blister and pus flew out with some velocity. They are from Harrisonburg. Son thru-hiked in 2007. So we quizzed him greatly on Maine and what to expect. Tucked in bed I can’t wait till tomorrow. Fore!!!!

We scrabbled from our tents to drop the rain flies and secure our houses. Winds blew the mist in my face as I lay listening to the rain pelt the tent. Sure hope that creek doesn’t rise too far. Two more fronts move over us as the night turns to day. 7:00am time to travel. The rain has stopped just enough for us to break camp and eat a quick breakfast. I duct tape my golf club to my right hiking stick with only a faint hope of getting to hit it up on Max Patch today. Rain begins as we head off. Captain and I are trying out our new rain packas purchased at trail days. It’s a full cover over us as well as your pack. No way for water to run down your back between you and the pack now. Nice. It also is pretty long so it covers my shorts and my butt when I set down. I’ll have to adjust the sleeves though because it’s one size fits all so they are quite long. Shortcut has slowed greatly today, she is running out of gas. She gave blood this week it’s catching up with her she believes plus she’s toting about 28 pounds on her short frame. The trail is a full running stream at this point. My feet squish as I take every step. If I only had those tall pretty colored kiddy water boots I’d have it made. I jump up into the middle of the trail with both feet splash splash. I laugh to myself like a little kid. Sure is easier to take this wet day since we only have to walk out to the shuttle and not spend the night in wet clothes. I have put some distance between them again and decide to take a morning break on a log. Eating a snack I notice my surroundings…small bugs crawling about this dead tree. Ants foraging for food. A few birds hopping around under the leaf cover. A new mushroom grows beneath the muck of rotting bark. A trail leads to an overlook, no need to even check it out, fog. Hootie,Hoot, they are here. The morning climbs are abrupt but short and continue. 9:30am I’ll see you guys at the patch.Working my way closer to the summit I know now there will be no view today. Foggier as I go but hey it ain’t poring and cold. Coming to the road crossing a gal in a van drives over to check her coordinates. “Is this Lemon Gap?” She is 4 miles off and has hikers to meet. She tells me Max Patch parking is just ‘down’ the road. Down being the wrong way here. I have a gut filling about that and continue on up the AT. I’m still anxious to reach the patch even under the circumstances. A sign reads 0.4 to the summit and the same for the trailhead parking which is where our shuttle should be at noon. 10:45 now. Yes I am way early so I have time to explore. I trek on to the summit the trail emerges into the field climbing around to the side. The winds hit me now as I am totally exposed, not naked by the way. Shoot I could have been though and no one who have known. Man what is out there? What am I missing? Bright flowers appear but only as I get right on top of them, the fog is too thick. I reach the tippy top, a side path is supposed to lead me to the parking lot which I am also supposed to see easily. NOT. I decide not to chance it and retrace the AT back the first sign and follow that marked path around the patch’s side. I begin to hear people the parking lot is close. 11:00, I wait.Several folks are here for the first time and say they put off coming till today because it was to be the prettier of weekend. Bummer for them too. White Crow comes zipping into the parking lot so we chat till Captain and Shortcut arrive. The ride out was entertaining to say the least, bouncing from side to side around the winding forest road. White Crow holding back yesterday’s lunch so to speak. We three reminisce over the trips events, how we made the best of what was given us and views to take in on another day.","Groundhog Shelter

Thanks to Larry he picked Mountain Lake for our destination and why not, he’s never seen it AND there’s a golf course up there. LOL We didn’t pack those clubs but we scope out the course and old club house.Arriving mid morning I wondered how much the fog would be burned off and how chilly it would be. Well both were still in the air. The fog was manageable for seeing the trail and close surroundings but no views down in the valleys by any means. Only the white abyss from those noted overlooks atop Salt Pond Mountain. Temps held close to mid 40’s with a hint of mist in the air.Leaving the lodge behind Larry is quick to note ‘we are walking up hill’. How did this happen? Heck we drove all the way up this mountain. Well almost to the top. Ahh I am back to my old tricks. We turn form the nice paved walk way and head into the woods following the red blazed trail ironically called White Dot Trail. Up we go leveling off to a wide road bed which then opens to a large field, the golf course. Wonder of wonders I say out loud, I left the trail in the fog (Shenandoah) and now I’m back in it. Larry is quick to pick out the old greens and tee boxes, trying to envision the lay of the course. Time and nature has slowly taken back her land. The clubhouse remains rock strong literally with all the wooden beams long gone probably used as fire wood from pass through hikers. We walk almost the whole course and then head back into the woods to make a loop back to the lodge.I’m trying out yet again other foot gear, Salomon Gortex trail runners. They are a cool green and can be spotted for miles. Hahaha My feet stayed dry in the tall wet grass and the tread held well on the wet leaves too. I’ll know more about them once I have some more miles on them and truely get them soaked. Passing some other connector trails we make our way back to the lake and walk her dried up bed. There was some water rising in the far back crater but it has a long way to get before she is full again. Some tourists are out now and checking out the lake as well. The lodge’s red roof stands out thru the heavy air and matches perfectly with the landscape. I’m guessing next week will be the peak of the leaves up here.We meander back to our car hand in hand glad we shared this wonderful place high on the mountain.","Mtn Lake

Just a few cars were parked this morning but we guess there will be a full lot by this afternoon. Nikon sported his new blaze orange vest scampering ahead turning back every now and again to make sure we were coming.   The ‘new’ path has worn in like an old trail now. I, myself, liked the original route but guess the erosion issue made the ATC move it along the backside of the mountain. One benefit is we are out of wind shot but I do miss the views as you once climbed along the edge to McAfee. Money plant lined the trail as we move away from the sound of Rt 311. The woods are very still now, actually quite pleasant as we take off that extra jacket and gloves. About 45 degrees I’d say and not looking like it will get much warmer. We brought our new packas to try but never had to break them out, the rain held off. A steady climb and then the turn by the big rocks and we are here, McAfee 3197 feet. Glad they have the sign up now. A couple we met this morning is up here and freezing from standing out in the wind without enough clothes on, jeans and wind breakers. I’d bet they’d pay big bucks for our wool hats and down jackets. We dress in our warm gear before going out from tree line on the ‘big rock’. Take our picture take our picture and that we did for each other and a few other couples who arrived. We showed them the area land marks from way up here and pointed out Tinker Cliffs. Catawba Valley was as pretty as ever even under this overcast day. The sun tried to peek out but just never got threw. Scrambling out to the edge we snapped the last of our photos and headed back down out of the wind to eat our lunch. Walking the fire road back we talked of our next hikes and Maine. We met a few late starters heading to the knob. Some with a kick in their step and some, well not so spry. We both were glad we came on out today even with the chance of rain. You never know what the trail will bring you even upon its many returns but they are always memorable for what they are.","McAfee Knob

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/292922,"What is it with this fog? Is it following me? Have a committed some trail violation I am unaware of? YES it was foggy and dreary on our fall overnight to complete a section over Iron Mountain.We have hiked from both ends of this section Watagua Rd and then from TN 91 but couldn’t get the middle completed so we decided to pack the overnight gear and get’r done. Leaving at 6am we anticipated the clearing of the clouds but it just never happened. We put on the trail about 9:30 after a big breakfast at Cracker Barrel. Yep ya’ll missed that too. The trail had been rerouted so the initial climb to the crest was much more gradual NICE. I was hoping the see the damn dam but nope fogged out. No photo ops. We did have fun trying out our new gear though. Captain and I both purchased the Packa when at Trail Days. It’s a pack cover incorporated with a rain jacket. Full hood and pit zips and has a little skirt action too for extra mid leg coverage. One size fits all so they say. It worked well too. Put the cover over your pack with all the ‘extras’ just tucked inside of it, then when the rain squalls come (don’t take off your pack now) just reach over the head behind your shoulders and pull your hood over your head and pop out the sleeves zip her up and your ready to roll. Rain stops or your get warm just slip your arms out, hood off and let them fall to your sides, keep truckin. Perfect. In addition we both have new trail shoes, Salomon trailrunners, tennie boppers for a quick fleet of foot. You feel like there’s nothing on your feet, light and airy. I really want to use these in Maine and so I shall put them through this hiking season to see how it goes. As you know Captain swears by them. Heck his last pair lasted thru 3 seasons and all the rain in Shenandoah. He has his new pair on today. So we are the green footed flyers.The packs feel great even though it’s our first time with them on since May. We are consolidating some gear to prepare for Maine. Less is best. I am tentless, we shall use Captain’s bigger Henry Shire tent and in exchange for that weight I’ll carry the food and cooking gear. Humm I’m sharing a tent, I just have to have my stuff in IT’s place- this shall be interesting. Oh and by the way Captain, keep that dog off my sleeping bag!!!No worries about that in Maine but tonight that’s a different story. Hell it’s wet out here ya know.The thru-hikers are out man. We met 5 heading south to Springer and talked with them about their trips thus far. All had a rainy season even starting from Maine in June. They will be hitting the Smokies in a cold time too. Good luck to them. Met one fella from Brooklyn, colored guy heading to Harpers Ferry. First saw him at Vandeventer Shelter our 5 mile mark. He was loaded down, 60 pound pack. We ate lunch together and departed. Who know he’d be staying at our camp tonight?“Where the heck is that shelter?” I said this for the last mile approaching Vandeventer. I’ve been here before it should be right by this laurel thicket. Well I past like 5 of them and then finally it showed. The wind and blowing fog have chilled me and I need more clothes on and didn’t want to stop. So I did get the pants zipped on and out of a damp shirt and into a warm layer. Captain said he felt the same way coming in for lunch too. We aren’t hiking at our normal pace which is expected since only the second trip out since May but it will come. I joked with him that I was strolling along at a pace like window shopping in Gaitlinburg. That got a chuckle. The day proved a hard climb for the old man as well. 7 miles to camp and a long grade drained him and was hard on an out of shape knee. I slowed so not to get too far ahead because waiting proved quite chilly. We planned to join back up at named gap so I waited and waited. Nikon go back and check on him, I’d say. He did three times and no Captain. I kept watching thru the drifting fog and no Captain. 30 minutes have past, finally his white hair pops over the hill. Yep right thru that fog it shows up. He is tired, 3 miles to go. Oh by the way my shoes are leaking in water, this ain’t good and it’s not that wet out here.We check the map for more land marks to help prove our distance walked and verify closing in on Iron Mtn Shelter. Ahh the powerline, we ARE right here. Water source for the shelter is on the way so we pony up and share the load, water bag filled and carried between us on our hiking poles. Good no one is here right now, we can spread out our gear and ready for night fall. Hot toddies are poured as we watch the woods settle finally. The winds have died down. An image approaches, a bear, no a black man, it’s Brooklyn Brown, the same guy from the last shelter. His real trail name is Jay Rock. We share our water, gather more and set up our camps. Come to find out he has fought for our country in Desert Storm and Afghanistan. Strange how strength can be measured different ways... You’d think this strong army guy could climb any mountain but you put 115 pound pack on him and it will take him 3 days to get up the approach trail to Springer. Yep that’s what it took him. He did make it to Fontana Dam on that trip a few years back and that’s were he started from for this trip.Look out the shelter’s on fire!!! Yep he turned over his cook stove not once but twice. NEW trail name, fire starter just like Cascade. The last toddie goes down, yes I shared. Jay Rock tucks himself tightly in his bivy sack. Captain, get that dog on your side of the tent!!! Actually Nikon, was a good boy and stayed right by his master feet UNTIL….yoop yoop, Coon Dogs, they came right thru our camp. I’m not sure how many I wasn’t about to peek my head out of the tent. Heck we were wrestling with Nikon in there. He paced from one side to the other yooping right back at them. That wasn’t our only night noises, there were the occasional wooop, flap crack, dang that stinks. Ok I used to merely hear the noise from an adjacent tent now I have the pleasure of sharing. Thanks. What’s that? HAAHOO HAAHOO, Two hoot owls conger up their conversation at an early hour as well. Nikon joins in too. At this point mine as well check out the stars for a nightly piss. Yes the stars are out, will be clear tomorrow when we met up with Shortcut to hike out.","Watagua Dam Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/292985,"Mountain Top Morning 9:30amAh it was good to sleep in or at least wait till the sun totally came up to warm our surroundings. A nip was in the air as we unzipped the tent to let Nikon out for his morning sniff around. No need to rush up and out since Shortcut will not be at the trail till 9am. She is walking in to meet us at Uncle Nick’s Monument and then we’ll all walk out together. She is trying out some gear that Captain is loaning her for the Maine trip. Backpack, sleeping pad, tent. We say our goodbyes to Jay Rock and wish him well. Packed up and ready to roll we are. What a beautiful day. This is how I imagined it, the woods glisten with hints of yellows and orange leaves. Vibrant skies of blue between the tree tops. Too bad our walk is only 4 miles today I could walk all the way into Damascus I think. Up ahead…Uncle Nick Grindstaff, the old house chimney is his monument and headstone. A man who lost it all when out west, he ran into some bad times and hard women who took him for everything. He became bitter and a loaner who set himself up in these woods. As the stone says “lived alone, suffered alone, died alone” The place has a wonderful view down over the valley just on the edge of Iron Mountain. Shortcut arrives just as we do, so we visit.Taking a leisurely walk out we talk about Maine and our plans. My mind runs wild with questions. We meet two southbounders, California gal and Ohio guy, trail couple now we assume. They tell us about their trip thru the 100 mile wilderness, wet wet wet. They were there in May. The green tunnel of Virginia is more than that they say, they love our state and its golden fall. The sound of the road is near now our adventure has come to a close.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/293279,"Some times JUST a walk in the woods is all a person needs. Not big overlooks to reach, no grand views, no sunshine to break the path…just a walk in the woods plan and simple. That’s what we had Sunday by way of the high water trail to Jenkins Shelter. The old AT used to run along the banks of Little Wolf Creek crossing her as many at 14 times. A lovely section now rerouted away from to the high grounds. The bridge once over the big creek gone and never to be replaced oh well we can wade it come summer time and bush-whack the old path for some adventure hiking. “So how much up do we have today? Mileage?” This was the topic of dispute and Lead dog is labeled a liar. Harsh words my friends. “This is an 8.2 mile hike with a climb initially from the dirt road to a forest road, mileage up well I’d say about 2ish. I’m no GPS or topographer, just Lead Dog.” I read my maps and gather my information from various trail source and thar ya go!!We head up that hill steady as she goes, BonBon close on my heels with Captain and Larry slowly dropping out of sight. Yep them boys were talking up a storm and solving the worlds problems and forgot to breath. Huffin and a Puffin they come into sight when we stop for a shoe adjustment. Yes I have my newest shoes after my last ones leaked, bad sealing on the gortex I guess, these worked great. Each turn we think is the final one till flat ground but not so quick. Near the crest we meet a group of 6 hikers heading south, 2 gals and 4 men. I’m sure they stayed in Jenkins shelter as it is on 10:30 now. They didn’t take on the thru-hiker look so we think section hikers out for several days. A few miles of walking the fire road and we soon are at the old AT junction so I know it’s about a mile down to the shelter. Boy Larry’s gonna love that, us girls chuckle. Sure enough we hear his protests later at the shelter. “I can read, this sign say 5 miles to the dirt road, WHAT? I can count too, that’s 10 miles man!!! YOU LIED TO ME WOMAN!!! And worst yet you got the Captain lying for you too.” Old sign dude, didn’t you know ‘they’ round up those trail signs, 4.6 miles = 5? We checked out a really cool spot to camp along the creek and read the shelter log before heading back out. It really was that bad of a climb back up from the shelter, heck we were back at the fire road before we knew it. Look he’s got sandlas on. Yep another 3 hikers heading south. One guy from Maine who I asked question after question to. The boys ran into them as well and figured the third hiker was his mom, they had met up in Shenandoah and he was finishing with her down to Springer. Heavy clouds have rolled off the adjacent ridges, lighter skies try to prevail but only grey, just a few bright leaves left on the trees.

Waiting here by the hay bales where once an old farmhouse stood I take in the morning and remember the many treks on this section.“Where the heck is Captain?” We are all waiting to drop our ‘hike to car’ off John’s Creek Trail so we only have to hike one way today. The word is he’s been spotted at the Newport store with some SOBO’s. He’ll be giving them a ride back to the trailhead after they resupply. The Straggler is here along with Bonnie Boop and Jeff. We visit.The car has been dropped and off we go to Kelly’s Knob. A warm morning so no need for any extra layers today. Nikon is quick to make small talk with the area donkeys which don’t take kindly to him. EEE AWWNK, EEE AWWNK their backs bristled and ready to charge us at any time. They are on either side of us giving an uneasy feeling in case we need to make a run for it. My legs are getting stronger each week and before I know it we are at the shelter and already have past the old Blair Witch House. The real up hasn’t even started yet though. Say what’s keeping the Captain lagging today?…a double dipper?...He’s back in the game?!? The trail talk picks up as usual. You’ll just have to come along to get the inside information is all I got to say. Facing the path to the knob I know of what is in store however some of us don’t and the questions start and then the bitchin….So how far to the top of this damn hill?I have my grove, my pace, step after step gradually climbing the knob. One lone tree of color stands beside the trail. Bright yellow leaves hanging on as if protected by the surrounding woods. Cresting the top we hear voices, there are a few section hikers at the overlook. Packs loaded down with ALL the NECESSITIES for three days. I remember those trips, too much shit!! They give us our own time to take in the views and enjoy our lunch. A big oak has died and fallen nicely between a wide opening in the rocks creating an extra step to skip across. Still treacherous most of us elect to stay put except Jeff, The real King of the Mountain. Captain gives us our coordinates compared to Mtn Lake, Bald Knob and John’s Creek. A quick recap of our hike out, via a side trail and what to look for so not to miss your turn, and we’re off. ½ mile of AT then 2.5 miles of John’s Creek trail soooo I/We think. Again the trail signs shoot Lead Dog down on her directions. I looked at my maps, the various resources from area hiking groups, and dang if I don’t get fooled again or should I say my hiking friends get fooled again. “Why don’t the estimations work in our favor?” Harry exclaims. “I’ve been had by Maatha” Jeff mutters. Yep that thar sign said 3.5 miles oh well, we’ll have to JUST DO IT as Nike says. Turns out this yellow blazed trail ain’t so bad. Some nice views out on either side of the ridge and gradual down, a path not well traveled either. Heck we hiked off in 1 hour. Perfect. We’ll have time to return to our road side parking for some more trail talk and relaxation. And that we did.More SOBO’s are looking for a ride to town. They are yellow blazing, taking the highways to get from point to point. They hope to finish Springer by Christmas.

Outside on the porch are 4 doors each labeled, laundry, three bathrooms one with a shower. Very rustic place, drafty too tucked back in the holler.We build a fire and pick out our bunks.

Firewood I’ve gathered and picked our tents areas clean of debris, now to await the boys.We all had a pretty good nights sleep. Captain stoked the fire while Larry and I tousled in the honeymoon bed. Now it’s not what you think. The darn springs were so warn out she rolled like a waterbed with every move. Once a wave almost threw me overboard.We were heard last night according to Bob this morning. He was in the bed from a hard days work on the trail.Bob Peoples, a perfect last name for a very giving man. A real people person with loads of stories and history about the trail. He has worked on the trail for 13 years, 10 years with his hostel and serviced 16,000 hikers. From Boston his thick draw was quite entertaining.First thing this morning he offered us each a pair of nippers and a pic to work his trail maintenance section. Driving us to the trailhead he told us about his work for the ATC. Has 30 volunteers expected today to work on the very section we’ll be walking. They are moving the path closer to the waters edge for better views around the lake. Larry exclaims some few hours later as we pass this work site “A year to damn late” as we crest another small climb. “Thought this was flat till Rt. 321?”Fog was thick early but patchy blue skies prevailed, thank goodness. Again I was wondering why me, why me, will I ever escape this menus? A fisherman was spotted on the lake – Watauga Dam sign our only view. A paved path worked us around a small section of the lake before turning back into the woods.Wonder if Harry will be at the road crossing? We soon arrive and no Harry. Leaving a note in case he does ‘straggle’ by we eat a snack and begin our climb to Pond Flats. 1500 feet up this mountain - shape resembles a thimble, steep on both sides and flat on top with a steady view of the Watauga waters. I see now how it gets it name.Graded well this path is easy, well for some. Larry protests at me not to sound sooo grateful as he is suffering and weighted down something awful. I need that pacifier Bob spoke of when he was in the military. He had one taped to his desk for whiners. ‘I like grape!’ Larry says.So here I set writing while the boys are napping in their tents. The sun casting shadows between the trees. Peaceful-The stillest I can ever remember the woods. The only movements are tiny gnats floating by, a few left over cobwebs glistening and my pen touching the paper. So I shall stop and just remain quite too.","Kincora

After a good nap and some campfire talk the big guy professed his new found size was all that was slowing this hiker from speed and agility along the trail. Just imagine the ease which one could climb a mountain just a tad lighter in the shorts and mid section. Not to mention without that 7 pound tent and who knows what all else that women of mine put in my pack with me not looking. (radio, beverage, down blanket uhhh I think that was all I added)Yes we did have some laughs about our day’s trip and truly enjoyed the sunset from the flats. Blazing skies changed numerous colors. First a bright array of yellows then wispy pinks cutting through what was left of the blue sky. Then the finale of flame reds and oranges till gone to black. A clear night with stars galore.We broke camp at sun up or some of us did..220 was still getting just a few last minute winks. One tired pup but still in good spirits he finally poked his head out…is it cold out there? The night was really pleasant considering the 20’s that were forecasted. I’d say we got upper 30’s since our water bladders did not freeze hanging outside the tents. It couldn’t be too cold now because I needed no gloves while packing up. Speaking of packing, I took some of the mystery weight from 220’s pack. Poor baby - besides I need the practice with more weight more than him. Wow check that out…all of Dennis Cove and Watauga area was a pit of fog snaking thru the valley. I’ve never seen such. Walking way over it all we started the steep trail off Pond Mtn., my toes crunching in my shoes and arms pressing forward to provide leverage against my poles. Much harder hiking this side that the other for sure. I hear the roars of rushing water..Laurel Falls below. We meet a few hikers on the way and more day trippers closer to the bottom. A flat walk along the creek which is rushing quite fast the path lined with rhodes like always. Nice and cool too. We cross a couple of well made bridges and then come to a rather perplexing trail route. The path turns from ground to rocks running closer and closer to the edge of the waters. I hear the falls up in front of me but can’t see the sound. White marks are now on the 2 foot wide rock slab beneath my feet leading to a blind corner. Humm do I follow around this? I peek my head around yes. My sticks now in one hand, my chest pressed close to the stone I hug it and side step around the corner. Quick don’t hesitate- keep my weight moving forward because back is in…like wet in the water. I scurry along to set up a photo of the boys coming around. Captain is quick about it too and then Larry opts to unbuckle and pass his pack around and then his body. Wew we all made it.Laurel Falls a 40 foot wall of rushing water is finally seen. Wow running as full as I’d want to be near, load too. Larry elects to remain above where the white blazes turn and me and the Captain scamper down for a quick photo. Now comes more trail trickery.Step after step after step, wet leaf covered rock stairs take us up to the old railroad bed 500 feet worth. One slip and you’re done. I’m sweating yep me too. A nice grade now to our finish line, Dennis Cove. We meet a nice fisherman who is familiar with the area. Asks if we’d like a lift back to Kincora…well HELL Yes is the look in Larry’s eyes. ’We’re off the blazes I can cheat all I want”…Trail magic… his first experience.

Passing the newly restored Wood’s Hole we peered out to see what else was coming together in the holler of Sugar Run. Wow more hiker bunk houses and more clearing going on up behind the old place. We didn’t get to go visit but plan to on another day. Standing with authority an older gentleman addressed us as we approached the hunter headquarters. Fully dressed in camouflage down to his boots, heck even his cane might have been camo I’m not sure, he bellowed ‘how the hell are ya?’ Then he proceeded to check between my ears to see if I had anything up there since I was associating with the likes of THE Captain. 80 some years old and as sharp as a tack he told us of killing a coyote and selling him for $25. To whom you say…well I’m guessing one of those Pearisburg boys in town. HAHAHA We leave him for the woods….A cold morning it was, the frost just wearing off. A little climb to the AT by way of this forest road gave us hardly enough time to work up some warmth either. “Hey Bonnie how much for those gloves?” Harry cries. Scantly clad in few hiking clothes The Straggler was a mite chilled. By mid-day he was pulling out the last of his layers, a bandana and a pair of socks. Now that’s packing lite.Talking about easy walking my friends, this was cake. All fire road through the tunnel of rhodes and out of the winds of the ridge soon to come. Nikon lead our way with Ginger close on Bonnie’s heals. Once off the fire road the trail turned up to crest Pearis Mountain.

The forecasted clouds have gathered over us now and a chill of rain is in the air but none falling as of yet. 55 was the high NOT, Harry is quick surmise. Maybe 40’s. Captain sports his new wind suit, Montane bikers gear. Sleeking thru the forest he’s the best dressed of the all. We met two SOBO’s heading to Wood’s Hole we presume. That’s where I’d be going if I were them. Then shortly we come to the actual Wilburn Valley overlook and then Angels Rest. Not staying at either too long we head off the mountain to make our scheduled grubbin stop at the New River Grill outside of Pearisburg. There was a lot of smacking goin’ on beside eating. Mostly on the trail mind you. Bon Bon tries to recap the ATC documentary comparing Captain to the OLD man who summated Katahdin..hell he was like 70 or something like that. SMACK.

My senses are keen. My eyes dart to every spectacle. Ice on a log left from last night’s cold snap, unusual fall foliage-dried flower remains and the wooly worms, man were they out. 2nd hour - The wooden stile signals me that I’m at the fields. Star Haven shelter is just ahead. I decide to check it out and see what has been written in the trail journal since last visit. The place looks very neat, no hunters have tarped the opening to protect them from the wind like last time. I don’t recognize any trail names written so I move out to the openness of the fields and take in the views. Ahh I say to myself that sun sure feels good on my back. No wind really to make me hurry off either. Sure glad my feet are on the ground for this view as well. Just last week I was flying over these fields from Harry’s plane and was ohhing and ahhing for the wrong reasons. “Harry the wings are tipping!!” Gobbling down my left over turkey samich I turn my trek back down to the car.

Calm winds once again and not too cold as the sun warmed things up from 17 degrees to about 40. We began our day from Niday parking lot where the trail crosses Craig’s Creek road getting the steepest of the climb out of the way and the shortest approach too. The trail winds along the bottom of the valley crossing numerous footbridges before turn up towards Brush Mountain. Graded nicely it wasn’t a hard pull even with the snow on. Snow clumped on every bush, tree, and twig making them look like they had been dipped in cotton. A real pretty sight. Once up high enough we could see out over the valley which being snow covered gave a three dimensional depth to the rolling hills. Along the way I practiced my trail maintaining techniques of clearing downed limbs and knocking overhead snow from draped branches over the trail. “Come on thru Captain I’ll hold this big ol’ snow covered limb from dumping snow on you…come on…trust me!!” Footprints came into our path once we crested the north side of the mountain connecting to the forest road. They must have started from the parking area down the way, wonder how far they are going, wonder when they came through? A plane flies over, can’t be Harry he’s in Florida right? Can’t be Audie either? We continue on to his monument having lunch from the bench which faces the granite stone structure in his honor. Several flags fly from adjacent trees giving salute. Again very peaceful.Connecting back to our leading footprints we head off towards Trout Creek and our awaiting car. The snow has drifted along the exposed ridge line here and we can now see McAfee Knob and the approaching AT path from Dragon’s Tooth side. A very defined look with the snow. How cool. Déjà Vu sets in as the trail seems to never quite turn off the mountain. Each turn down seems to look the same. I’m following the footprints and the scant trail blazes, very faded. Finally the sound of trout creek is heard. We are near the bottom. The footprints from our mystery hikers have left a slick last ¼ mile along this slope. Theirs turns off to their car and us leading to ours. Tracks to soon fade away, leaving a trail waiting to be walked again.","Audie Murphy Monument

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/295806,"I’ll make this short a sweet kinda like our event Saturday. Hike was short and the sketti was oh so sweet. Harry and Betty made it out from Bluefield to join us. When Larry and I arrived, they were sorting thru their various sundry of clothes. Which layer should I wear under what and how much of each? Layer by layer Harry’s red hair disappeared with only his mustache and eyes viewable. Betty kept adding and pulling off clothes like a kid trying to come out of what her mom just put on.We elected to not take the zip-line across the creek because Nikon couldn’t cross with us. Now I did say elected as a vote was cast. Now this added 1 mile to the trek, with a quick protest from Larry. “I did NOT sign on for more than 3 miles! It’s damn cold out and Nikon can just not go! He’s a dog and no dog’s gonna out vote ME!” Well guess what?   We hiked that extra mile.So we loaded up in the van and put on the trail at the new stony creek bridge aka pine swamp bridge. The parking lot was open for ample parking to say the least. Walking along the creek we were protected in the valley from the harsh winds hollowing along the ridge tops. Not long we warmed up but no layers shed today just maybe a zipper opened for some cool air. Most of the snow was gone too so footing wasn’t a problem. It was nice to have Betty along for another hike since she hadn’t been out since our trip to Kelley’s Knob some few years ago, in the snow then too I might add. The boys told old war stories and filled the holler with laughter. The purpose of this little trek was to show off Pine Swamp Shelter’s new roof and to hang our tenting signs so hikers would know there was a flat area about the shelter to camp. We put one at the shelter on a tree and then another above where the trail comes off the ridge but a path continues out the ridge. Perfect and not a moment too soon, with the snow squalls and heavy clouds we chilled quickly from stopping. Bring on the spaghetti man. We couldn’t skedaddle up that road quick enough.  A warm fire and the smell of Italian sauce filled the air. Miss Shirley was manning the kitchen ready for us all. Salad and bread to boot. Harry timidly took second seat as we elbowed our way in front of him. Hey, past actions speak loader than words. There was more than enough to go around AND AROUND!!!","Pine Swamp Bridge

Just read on and you’ll see otherwise.Yak traks yes or no? Gaiters nah. Extra gloves check, extra parka why not. The array of hiking gear was flying left and right as we suited up for the bone chilling day. Harry had top honor of best dressed with the most layers. With his super parka he looked like an Everest Sherpa awaiting his next trip to the summit. Captain and I sported our wind stopper layers under our light weight down jackets and were toasty warm. Starting at Kimberling Creek we decided to just do an out and back. Not knowing what the forest road looked like and if iced over we just parked off the hard top road. Powdery snow dusted the hill side but didn’t interfere with our footing. Only once did I get a chill from the wind which caught us on the north facing slope above Trent’s Store. But that soon diminished as we hooked back around the mountain down toward Dismal Falls.Stomping along thru the snow I noticed the skies clearing. Check out the sparkling snow crystals!!! What little sun snapped thru the passing clouds made the forest twinkle with specs of white light. Very cool.Trail talk was abundant. With two men and a lady what can you expect? Trash talk baby that’s what. Say Martha, don’t fart or you’ll blow your boots off. Now can you just see that? Me setting down on a log and CA-WHOOM, my boots go flying off into the woods! See I had my black hikin britches on which have tight legs. So I pulled them down over my boots to keep the snow out. I’m still laughing about it. What happens when you drink a gallon of “make you go goo” and you don’t go? Just ask the Captain, eyes start floating, gut expands becoming pregnant, beads of sweat pop out. Hurry Shirley and get the plunger and pliers The Captain’s got a turtle head poking out and it’s stuck!!!! Laughing so hard we could hardly hear the falls as we approach them. Just a small roar under the frozen waters. Checking out the lower ledge of the falls I was careful not to take a slip while taking some pictures. We’ve seen if totally frozen over but not today.Back on the trail we head in the direction of Wapiti Shelter. A fairly easy portion with a few ‘little hills’ followed by tunnels of rhododendrons. Dismal Creek and the AT wind a peaceful path down here in the valley. Protected we are. With night fall coming sooner this time of year and still 5 miles to return to our car we elect not to push it and hold up for lunch. Yep no 15 miles today. A smile comes to Harry’s face. Spotting footprints in the snow became the past time on the way back. That’s a fox. Those are deer and rabbit. What’s that? Humm something has left its mark right in the middle of the trail…some wild creature you say…it was sure moving fast look at the streak ….yellow snow…must have been a Lead Dog.","Kimberling Creek

Harry meekly speaks; I just remembered some miles back I left my keys in your car Martha. OoooK and why is This a problem? The problem is I have come with two real good ones today. My car is back at Sarver and we’re at Level Green with two cars that can’t go. Captain has left his lights on and the battery is dead. Oh and by the way a reminder was spoken upon leaving this morning…”Captain, will your lights just shut off?” with a reply of YES…Well guess what? They didn’t. Sometimes a well made plan just doesn’t come together….Heading up Sarver Holler side trail we told Harry of what was in store for the next mile and a half. See that power line there? We’re going to be walking under it later on today BUT now we must make it up Sarver. There was a quick request to take the power line short-cut route but no, no’d by Lead Dog. I wanna hear the moans and groans like a true sadist. Sweat beads start popping out, calves begin to burn, and breathing becomes labored. “What the hell have I gotten myself into? I should be sledding down this not climbing up! Where’s the chair lift?” Glad there’s no snow to contend with on this slope. We face the south and the sun is trying to come out as we make it to the top. It really isn’t that far to the ruins but sure seems so when every step is on this simulated stair climber. I separate myself from the boys.Ol man Sarver’s home is just about dilapidated with no walls standing and down trees stretched across where the roof used to be. Just two stone chimneys remain sturdy tall. More snow here too making it a nice scene. Captain heads for the shelter to strip off his wool long johns and let his legs breath among other things. I’ll say no more there except KILT!!! Harry and I decide to forage the hillside to search of the Sarver cemetery. No luck on this trip. Every time I spot a grouping of cedars thinking it was the location, it came up empty. We gave up besides Harry’s boots were filling with snow fast and the brambles were stripping his lilly whites pretty good too. Snow still pilled on the ridge. The trail was not an easy path to follow with all the blow downs and previous trekker’s paths leading in every direction. Captain began his Tree Identification Class 101 as we made our way. I have to say we have much more to learn, I need a study guide or cliff notes or something. White Pine vs Buck Pine, Maples, Oak, Hemlock vs Cedar and so on. Oh don’t forget the off brands, Gum, Hickory, Locus, Poplar, see my confusion. We met a couple of hikers, two tech students hiking out and back from 42 to Niday. Heh boys that’s 22 miles ya know. Don’t know if they did it or not. Then there was Alabama Bob finishing his section from 42 to Daleville. He told us how slippery it would be going down the north side of this ridge and boy was it. Take a step and slide two in the slushy snow. Stick save, stick save. Hey Captain, be careful and not get down or your slip will fly up. Yeeeohhhh!!!Not long before we come to the big Keffer Oak, the largest blazed tree on the Appalachian Trail. Pretty cool and its right here in VA, our back yard even. Dimensions unknown we try a make shift measurement. Branches stretch out like arms reaching to balance her massive stature. Closing in on our cars tree pop quizzes fly from the Captain whose new trail name just may become Prissy if he keeps that kilt swishing. All I know is I’m glad to be in the front where Lead Dog is supposed to be cause if I’m behind him I’ll have to keep pulling his skirt down for the sake of decency. Speaking of cars this brings us full circle back to our dilemma….two cars one with no keys but has two batteries, one with keys but no working battery. I pop a cold one and set back and watch the MacGyver Twins in action. Sure glad that Hokie Hiker came along, a prepared VT student with jumper cables. We have spark and BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. Shut that horn off, I can’t. The security system has taken over and it’s possessed. Taking in another brewski I pass my keys off to Harry, guard these with your life. Sending these two Keystone Cops off to pick up my rig and return shouldn’t be any problem especially if they need to be found. Just follow the sound, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!!!","Sarver Holler

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/296462,"Here I set on a sunny Monday morning waiting on my hiking partner for the day. Better than working.A truck rolls in, slides in the mud to a stop right beside me. Doors locked-check, eyes on my trail map-check, I take a quick peek to see what he is doing. A large man dressed in overalls steps out, pants tucked in his gum boots. He glances at me and me at him. His ponytail is pulled tight and long handlebar whiskers hang below his chin, he smiles and then grabs gun from behind his cab and heads off across the big bridge for the woods. I watch him closely till he disappears out of sight. Wondering what he is hunting I look closely to see what’s in his truck bed. Buckets, tubs and fishing gear, a cutting board. I scan the woods again, the road.. where’s Harry? About 15 minutes pass and the hunter returns holding up two possums and mouths the words ‘I trapped em’. I open my car door to hear keeping a hand on the wheel and a foot inside in case I need to make a quick get away. He introduces himself as a local trapper and tanner who sells the hides of his caught game. He’s killed a coyote or two in the last few weeks, red and grey foxes and rabbits too. Asking if I’m walking the trail I do say so and that I’m waiting on some hikers to join me just in case he’s thinking of trapping me too. Giving a wish of a good day he drives off to check his other traps. The Straggler pulls in just minutes after his departure and we do a key and gear check since we are dropping cars today. Don’t want to end up like before with no wheels. Leaving my car here I load up in Harry’s van and hear a beep beep. A gage is telling us his gas is low. WHAT? Here we go AGAIN…another winner with me today. “Oh no worries it’s not totally empty, YET’ he states. Putting on at 611 a vehicle approaches, it’s the hunter. He has circled the valley roads checking his traps and says hi once again and wishes us a good hike, “That’s a long one”.The breeze is brisk but soon lies and the sun warms the air. A pleasant day it is. Some snowy spots along the trail in the holler nooks and then marshy trail where it has melted. The only sounds are us chattering between one another telling stories of our past and things of the future.Passing Jenny Knob shelter we hear the once dry creek bed trickling with water. Soon we cross Rt. 608 and turn back into the woods for one last climb to the ridge where we can see out on both sides. A somewhat rocky path but not so to hurt your feet. Ok Harry which kind of tree is this? Buck Pine no doubt. And this one? Maple, pretty sure. If stumped we’d just chalk that up to lack of education or needing a ruling from the Captain. Let’s go up to this little overlook some couple of 100 yards from the trail. It’s marked with blue blazes but not used much as there is no path. We can see for miles down the valley. A nice view, clear blue sky above, heaven. Most of the snow is gone now while we wind around this logging road heading closer to Kimberling Creek. Sure hope the trapper hasn’t put his traps close to the trail here. I shall not venture off for a pee that’s for sure. The big suspension bobs as we walk in time across it looking at the quicker waters of the Kimberly flowing beneath us. Again another good day on the trail, better than working that’s for sure.","Rt. 611

Blue…Clear…Crisp…Skies. Oh how I’ve missed you. A deep breathe ummm ummm good, the smell of nature. The laurels are still drawn up tight, the trail is packed solid snow. We have the path all to ourselves.Yak traks, gators, gloves and extra coats are all adorned. It’s still cold in this holler man. However it doesn’t take long with us walking in the sun to warm. Carolann is our finest dressed hiker today, CA City Slicker I shall call her, with her purple ski jacket, which is dropped behind some rocks on our ascent to the falls, “I’M HOT!” matching green tops and ear-rings right down to her sporty boots. We scatter in our sexes, the girls and the boys, chattering our way up the mountain. No one is spotted on the low trail, too icy for walking. The slush starts to form under our feet and we step forward one and slide back two. Drips of melting icicles fall from the rocky cliffs above us, casting shimmers of light. So cool.Coming close the falls the sound is muffled. Usually a big roar is heard from the waters rushing from her but with all the ice formed on either side much quieter. Footing is much more cautious now. All the previous walkers along here have this packed like the bobsled track of the Olympics. Some spots warranted hand and knees to maneuver. Jeff takes the point with his traks and walks right out to what I know is usually a swimmers hole. Bonnie spouts “if you go under we ain’t coming after you, see ya in the spring!” There were other footprints even closer to the falls but none in the group dared to go any closer. A canopy of icicles lined the ledges adjacent the cascades. Sure hope one doesn’t break free we might get speared. Wonder what’s above the falls? Jeff asked and man is he told quickly to pipe down as we don’t have time for such adventures Larry states. “There’s food at the New River Grill and we don’t want to keep it waiting”. Maybe another time I’ll take them on up to Little Cascades and then Barney’s Wall and way on up to Butt Mountain Fire Tower. If you haven’t heard that trip’s story just look back in my journal and enjoy. An easy stroll out it was with some slippin and a sliddin.

Sandra puts in a cell phone call standing at the crossroads.Posthole footprints scattered the mountain where people have tried to stay on the trail. Random paths stopped abruptly when the white blazes ran out where some areas had been relocated. The deep snow drifts had covered the brush which detours you from old to new blazes. Yes this trip was unusually harder due to snow pack but that just added to the adventure.We met up at the parking lot below McAfee and dropped a second car to hike to down where the trail crosses 624 below Dragon’s Tooth. Just a 6 mile stroll along the ridge how hard can it be? Glad Larry picked this trail and not me so I don’t get the grief today.Windy and colder than forecasted we all wrapped up our heads with boggins. Snow flurries whirled around with no blue skies to be found. Stopping just yards from the beginning I look over my shoulder and just Bruce and Bonnie are near. My troops are sucking wind, red faced and panting to speak. I have to laugh out loud. I didn’t know I was walking that fast. The sawtooth climb begins, up one side and down the next. Every north side of the trail is slick as snot. Keep your feet in the holes so not to take a slide down the slope. Stickless Jeff shows off his trail skills by pulling a drop and roll. That’s when you feet fly out, face plants the ground, and you roll quickly to your feet and act casual as if nothing happened a-tal.   We had nice views from either side of the trail looking down over the valley and THE Home Place. We’ll have to eat there next time, Ironto awaits today. I can smell the spaghetti already.Soon we arrive at the fields, only 2 miles to go and that ‘one last hill’ to climb. Look a sled. Yep a sled was left right along the path where some had played in the snow. So we had a little trail fun too. Smile Django ;o)We wonder if the creasy greens will still be found in the little creek we cross near the end and sure enough a few little patches have made it thru this harsh winter. Speaking of harsh, remains of a deer are strewn about ‘probably from a bear attack’ some demise. Now for the hill. I’ve caught my second wind and I’m in my glory as they say. Trudging along Jeff blows out and Bonnie comes to his rescue. I disappear among the white blazes and will be waiting for everyone at the truck. They arrive saying…“Glad we walked it this direction”   “I got a Charlie horse in my leg” Let’s go on up to Dragon’s tooth NOT” “6 miles? It felt like 10”   Larry appears from the last turn of the trail, whistling along, tuned into his own little world. Just one thing on his mind….Mountain View Italian Kitchen.

This doesn’t happen much any more. Reminds me of when I first started hiking and had to connect the dots along the trail of my new map. A feeling of accomplishment every time I highlighted the section just walked. Still much snow under foot but all packed down from the many weeks of freezes and trodden soles. The woods smell so fresh today. I think it’s the sun finally warming the trees so they too can breath again from such a harsh winter. A good number in our group today, 7 hikers and a dog. Heck even Noni and Denny have come from hibernation to stretch their legs. Places every one! Just like old times we fall in pecking order as the say. Even Django knows his spot in line, putting his nose right to Noni’s heels. Soon we have separated in two small groups. Wonder which I’m in? Huh, they don’t call me Lead Dog for nothin!Not long we are out of the snow pack and atop our first view of the day, Rawies Rest, a rock outcropping with pines around. We can see homes below and way off to the distance, Peaks of Otter. Jeff and I decide go down to short britches and make fun that Bonnie hasn’t that option wearing her winter pants. Glad I didn’t have those on today. HOT. Some slippery spots still make the climb treacherous and we are hoping on the return down most of the snow will have melted or at least turn to slush. The most southern slopes are bone dry and even dusty, who would have thought? This is for sure one of the most technical hikes I’ve done over the years. Rock steps turn into rock ledges to cat walk, then throw your sticks down cause you need both hands right here, glad they put those iron bars in for steps or how would I get up over this? That’s the AT and I love it. Waiting at the Tooth Junction for the second of our group I show Bonnie and Jeff what we had hiked last weekend. “See, there’s the big field we came out to and Sawtooth Ridge all the way back to McAfee”. This is one of my favorite views. A hootie hoot from below, they have announced their arrival. We gather back up together for lunch, some wipe sweat from their brow while others eat a samich. More hikers are arriving now that noon is here. Boys scamper up the tooth like spiders on a wall. No fear. Django gets an unsportman like conduct call for barking at the other dogs. Little dog, has big bark, this is my mountain, flit flit goes his tail. Time to hike back.A quick descent was made by my front pack since the icy spots are now just mush.

One thing I do know is Angels Rest is steep ‘in places’ and IS ALL UP for 1.7 miles. “Hey, Yo Jeffrey, You having fun yet?”Here I am trying to get my fat boys in shape. Harsh words from Lead Dog but I love them just same. Now MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT. The trail was soupier than I expected. I mean a 1500 foot elevation climb on the side of the mountain would lead you to believe all the water would have washed on down by now. A mountain spring was rushing both beside the trail as it should and then in the trail under foot. Where’s Noni to break these mud holes for us? No worries I wore plenty of muck out on my britches for her.Bon Bon is close on my heels with Jeffrey huffing behind her. Larry drops off in no-mans- land while Bruce stays close to his gal and puppy dog. Django still looking for someone’s boots to follow. The switchbacks help with the climb and to me make this a tolerable approach to rocks of the rest. Just now I sort of put that all together. See the trail’s steepness causes you to get out of breath and in need of a rest. Just so happens someone called this resting spot Angels rest. Maybe they saw angels on the trail. Or maybe they called out to the angels to give them relief of this mountain. Above the junction of angels overlook I hear a dog bark. Two boys have camped up there and I smell the smoke from a damp fire. Come to find out they couldn’t get it going at all last night. No wonder the only wood here are rhododendrons and they sure want burn even dry. Bonnie and I wait on the others to arrive one at a time. Jeff proclaims ‘this ain’t no fun’. Guess that last pull got the best of him. Larry kicks in another gear and blows past us head down for the top of this Godforsaken Mountain. There’s one more overlook, Wilburn Valley yet. Besides we’ll walk out a bit more and he wants a jump on things so not to be late for FOOD afterwards. Sounds like a broken record as the last three weeks have been all about hike and then FOOD.Some snowy patches remain leaving the trail packed slick with ice in the shady spots. Once on top very dry actually. The view off was quite hazy and looked as if a storm could brew any minute. Temps cool today but at least no rain gear had to be adorned. “So how far are we gonna walk?” Powerlines? Maybe we should just go back now. The vote, as you well know, comes down from the Lead Dog. And what I say goes. Well most of the time anyways. So we walked on out a bit to the lone rhode in the middle of all the other hardwoods along this ridge. I know it’s about half mile from the last overlook and if we turn around here we should be off the trail by 12:30 and in plenty of time to reach The New River Grill before they close. Besides my fat boys are already talking about their burgers and how famished they are. “My sandwich burned off half way up”, Larry spouts.With us all gathered up on the descent down the trail talk begins. Slams start against the boys various courting tactics to the girl’s lack of holding up to their end of the deal. Comments of marrying first time for looks and the second for money were quickly scrutinized and I do believe could have been the grounds for Larry almost de-balling himself while crossing a downed tree. Yep trail tricks like you’ve never seen before folks. Saddling up on a tree with his hiking stick lashed around his wrist and partially tottering on it and the tree at once. Quite a move if I say so myself. Thank goodness Bruce was close by to help unhem him. I’m sure if Sandra and Noni had been the ones to count on he’d still be there today as they’d just stood there and peed their pants laughing.

I’d say 60’s at the start with some overcast skies to keep the sun from baking us with no leaf cover just yet on the trees. There’s Captain’s truck waiting for me at 8:30 sharp. The parking area below the fields is already full with cars. Folks either got an early start or have already hiked in for anovernight stay during this unseasonably warm weekend. We drive on up the way to leave a car to hike off to at Pocahontas Road. Dang my explorer is gonna get dusty.Ah it’s good to back on the trail this time of year. Morning birds tweet and springtime smells are in the air. Trees are budding with some leaves starting to sprout. Hope they don’t get too far along and the May frost get them. We have a new hiker with us today, Leila. She is Nikon’s new trail gal, a friendly easy going doggy, with a thick black shinny coat of fur. She has one starry white spot below her neck and a bushy wagging tail. I do believe she kept her nose to the trail all day scouting out hikers past. So here we go each of us with dog on leash them leaping with anxiousness to go go go. “Daddy can we run now?”Having walked to the fields so many times I can just about count the curves before we reach the crest of Peter’s mountain. There’s the big seating log, The Ratcliff Roast. You remember don’t you Noni? We talk to 2 thru hikers here that are taking five. They are slack packing this 18 mile stretch. Both are from Richmond, tall and lanky men, and both experienced in gear and trail talk. Captain settles in for a long chat with them. Can’t you see me? Tapping my toes, are we gonna set here all day?!There were several hikers coming off the mountain on our way up. Two separate couples who spent the night at the shelter. We found a little tike's hat along the way and did meet the owner. Once at the Rice Fields there was a gal carrying her little guy on her back the sun blinding him. He was glad to have his hat back. Two other fellas accompanied her carrying packs. Guess she’s the stud in that family carrying the load and hiking all the way to Pine Swamp too. 18 miles impressive. Hazy views off to West Virginia today but the southerly winds felt good for a change. Usually chilly up here as the wind always blows. Listen…a plane. Can’t be Harry or he’d been at the trailhead this morning. The engine sputtering trying to force power with the head wind. I air my feet, feels gooood. The puppy dogs bask in the field grass. While we have lunch. Captain goes Hollywood style on me sporting his new spectacles. Yo Baby!!!Now for just a few miles to the mystery water source, the purpose of our hike today. I have my hammer, nails and H20 Signs for hanging. Water is running good from the site not noted in the trail books. I’m not sure why it has never been updated but at least now will be seem easier with these new signs pointing the way. Time to hike off this mountain by way of the powerlines. Humm that can’t be good. Every time a trip has taken us to a powerline trail it’s been well just plain STEEP. Glad we are going down this one. Easy for me to say I don’t have a bad knee. Captain has secured his brace on the bum knee and side winds his way down. The dogs take in the openness of the path and look as if they are smiling with enjoyment. Reminiscing of his wild days of youth The Captain tells me about terrorizing these side paths and roads with motorcycles and friends. Burn outs and blown tires, trucks and tracks.

The tent is plenty big BUT I’m just a creature of habit and of course have to all in its place. HAWe arrived at Kincora last night at 7:30pm, the lights on in both Bob Peoples house and the hostel. Hiker sticks lined the porch, all bunks almost full, just 3 left to choose from so we take the back room where one hiker as already bedded down for the night. His plan is to get up at 2am and start out. A fire warmed the front room and up stairs but our room was a tad chilly due to a screen left up. We took care of that right quick. A quite bunch with not much conversation, only eating. HA. So we turned on in to ready ourselves for tomorrow.Bob dropped us off at Elk Park where the trail crosses the road. 8:15am. He talked about his upcoming annual trail maintenance called Hard Core. He expects over a hundred will try to sign up, he can only take 100 as he only has that many tools he says with a chuckle. 78 maintainers will help coordinate the event. Sign up is at ATC tent at trail days. He also co-ordinates credit for the college students at Appalachian State and is expecting a group of boy scouts in Sunday to do some work. Has work crews every weekend year around. Said cutting blow downs on Roan Mtn. last month took skill and daring tact as trees stack a top one another for a treacherous clearing. Some just had to remain and re-route the trail. 4 feet of packed snow was found in places and you could hear a stream running underneath when the temps soared to 80 degrees. I still write as darkness has now settled in and Captain purrs, a plane passes overhead. We past thru farm country today. Not fields of crops but once cleared land with fences and fine views. Four wheeler trails are all over the place both on and crossing the trail making it easy to follow the wrong dirt path. No missed turned by us but we kept our eyes peeled for every white mark. On each crest we stopped to locate Hump Mountain and Little Hump. ‘There.. the open fields, that Roan Mountain’!Daffodils bloomed galore. Bunches placed at one time along a fence row or by an old building. Yellow mountain violets dotted the trail’s path and even saw a few early blooming trilliums. Looked for springtime beauties but none yet spotted. The trail was an easy lane, good footing for the most part thanks to Bob and his crews. The only trouble was figuring out mileage due to all the re-routes, 6 added miles worth due to switchbacks put it. We could see old paths and man they tackled every hill head on. So was the shelter really 18 miles away? Was the creek 11 or 13, should we camp here or there? So we just started clicking off land marks to keep track of the day.Jones Falls passed and nice size falls which could be heard some ways off resembled Crabtree falls. Not as big but looked like the water just fell from the rock ledge at the top of the mountain. We should be coming close to a valley now and Sugar Hollow. Sure enough we exit the woods to find a nicely kept cemetery then turn down to Jones Branch. What a beautiful path. Tall green grass lined her banks. A trickling branch. Looks like a nice spot for lunch under that thar tree. Shoes off, feet soothe in the cool grass, this is the life. Captain accusing me of acting like I’m at the beach. Well, maybe I AM…. Its a mini vacation ya know. We have stayed pretty close to one another thus far but a climb is in store from here so I say I’ll see ya at the top and he puts in his ear phones for some talk radio. A steady grade I’m making tracks now. The miles pass and so do the land marks. Mountaineer Falls, a small cascade which gave me a good refreshing drink. Then a stop at Mountaineer Shelter guessing I’d come about 7 to 8 miles I look over the map and try to remember all the info Bob gave us and the location of ‘the’ camp spot. Camp by the water… so every water crossing I’m looking for ‘the’ spot and his description. None match so far and wow just how far is far. The trail turns away from the creeks and now climbs up to a clearing and a park bench. What, a park bench? Yep a memoriam. So I take a seat and a decide what to do. Take in this view and wait? Go back and wait on Captain by the creek? It’s 4:00 now which means if I do wait it could be till 5 before I see him then we still need to find ‘the’ camp. Humm. A hiker comes, hey I saw you pass us by at lunch. Yes he says, he was at Mountaineer shelter when I stopped there. I ask if he has seen my old friend. Yep, he’s about 30 minutes back taking a break. Great he alive, ha, nothing doing I have to go back and check on him. So by the last creek I crossed I wait. Hootie Hoot I call out. No response over and over. I wait. Then bouncing along here he comes, kilt swaying and head phones in. “Hey old man take out them damn ear phones I’ve been calling you!!!”A smile comes to his face. “I’ve been listening to a religious station” Ha, must have been a lady with a sexy voice a talkin.We regroup and double check the map and figure 20 minutes and we’ll be at ‘the’ site. And so here we are down by the lovely creek called Laurel Fork. Setting up camp we talk over having such a perfect day 60 degrees with a 70 mixed in, air feeling like the A/C was on and blue bird skies. We guess we have 11 miles out tomorrow and will again just track the land marks and see.","Elk Park US 19

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/304594,"11:45AM Sunday MorningHere I set soaking up the sweet sun of spring. A wood pecker hammers away down the trail from me. I think the small town I see down below is Hampton TN - Later Captain informs me it was Roan – anyways it’s a destination for a shower and cold drink from Kincora I envision just the same. I recall some more of Bob’s conversation as he shuttled us yesterday…He has a bucket list along with 2 other friends. Guy and a gal that as he says have no other interest so to make it clear to each is own and no one ‘is with’ the other. Just friends spending good times over their later years of life and living it to it’s fullest. Last year Bob picked Spain for a camping trip and this year it’s the gals turn. She surprised him for his birthday just recently with a hot air balloon ride. Yep it was on his list so she set it up. They floated over The Smokies for 5 hours WOW. For every item marked off the list they add two. Way cool.Back here on earth I’ll tell you about our interesting morning leaving camp. We have three new trail games…Sleeping Bag Rafting, Spin the Bottle-where’s my top, and Can’t See – Where’s my Glasses. Here’s how to play…Sleeping Bag Rafting: That’s when you set your gear to close to the creek and ooppsie, sling the bag high in the air and see if it floats in that sea-to-summit stuff sack. A slip of the hand and Captain’s orange sack went tumbling to the creek and began bobbing away from us. I dart for a hiking stick and sprint down the bank below hoping to catch it. Captain follows in calm cool fashion. A stab or two and it’s safe ashore!Spin The Bottle –Where’s my top: Not what you’re thinking now. That’s when you again have gear to close to the water and lose your bottle cap you just took off before taking a big gulf of juice. We looked every where and assumed once again the captain flung it to the creek. You seeing a pattern here?Can’t See –Where’s my Glasses: Captain strikes again. Just up from camp we get hot and decide to shed those extra layers of clothing and while taking off his shirt he realizes his glasses didn’t get in the way. Uh oh I packed them up within the tent. Yep they are stuffed tightly in a sack down bottom of his pack. Soooo we scatter his gear all over the trail looking for them spectacles. Found. So 2 out of 3 ain’t bad for the morning.12:20PM Captain should be coming along soon now. I bask in the sun a bit longer wondering if a big ol snake will come out and join me. Hope not. I feel sure this turn down from the ridge will lead to Moreland Gap Shelter.He arrives and we chat about his climb. I knew it would be hard on him as it was some for me too. Just long not knowing how much farther to each false summit. The trail wasn’t hard just the length and hot sun to work on ya too. We guess another 6 miles from the shelter to Dennis Cove Rd. That would put me done at 4 and him about 5.Looking for the fire tower is our next land mark. Even separated on our hike we both end up having the same thought as we look for the tower. 2 miles off from White Rock mtn we each see the tower. Damn I bet this trail is gonna take us over there. It sure did. I liked this part of the day though, walking along the ridge line so you could see out both sides. I kept looking for Pond Mountain but never did see it’s distinct Flat Top. I started guessing my tree types as a pop quiz to myself so I wouldn’t fail the next Captain’s Tree Test 101. Shag Bark Hickory, yep that’s an easy one. I’ll leave him a note here saying so and tell him only a short time before he is out to the road. The trail from the tower down to here was quite trying on the feet. Down some 1500 feet over roots and rocks pushed those toes to the limit. I watch the altimeter click off the footage slowly as they grade goes on for 3 miles. Boy was I glad to see the little farm building which clues me in the road is near. Walking up the road to Kincora I have the feeling of a thru-hiker. Look like one, smell like one and getting the looks from other like one. Folks parked here for a little fishing and short hikes gave me a quick glance. Ah a cold drink and shower await me. Setting on the porch I chat with other hikers coming and going and tell them the mileage we have covered. One guy says he just walked the whole stretch just today. Damn 24 miles and started at 10am. It’s 5:00 now, that’s 3+ miles an hour. Captain appears at the steps, shower bag in hand. Damn girl you let me down he says all pitiful like. What What? Oh shit I should have drove down those 0.2 miles to pick him up. Oh well what are hiker’s for? But to hike.","Laurel Fork

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/305646,"I just love going down this road, Sugar Run. Stepping back in time, the road leads you to Woods Hole, a hostel like none other. The new owners Neville and Michael have a place that some of us only dream of. Bonnie and I set out on our hike from the road above the hostel hiking south towards Wapiti Shelter. Now we didn’t go way down off the mountain to the shelter but stopped short at an overlook that I had remember from times here past. Holy shit its cold stepping out of the truck. I sorta wondered if I should have put in the rest of my zipped off pants but too late now. I throw on an extra layer to block the wind and put on gloves. Bonnie even put on ear protection. We warm after about a mile and begin to feel the sun’s power. 60 is forecasted but up here might get to 50ish. Another clear blue bird day. I just love this time of year. The leaves aren’t even sprouting yet just a few flowers budding at this elevation. Chattering along as we meander from one ridge to the next we don’t even realize a hiker is right in front of us till we step on him. He’s packed light, turkey feather in his hat and with a trail dog. Going to Maine he states without missing a step and vanishes quickly. We pass two other hikers heading north as well, one young boy with his little black lab going to Harper’s Ferry where his mom will pick him up. Hiking in blue jeans he asks if Woods Hole is close as he doesn’t want to miss it. Close to the towers I point out to Bonnie if we’d stayed on the road we parked at we could have driven to this point. “Humm why didn’t we do that?” she says but then backs it up by saying well that wouldn’t have been much of a hike would it!? Exactly! This stretch really isn’t a hard 9 miles, some rocky sections and some elevation change but all terrain is graded well so not to wear you out. The trail turns to fire road for quick walking and before we know it we’ve reached the overlook, a rock outcrop tucked in rhodies just of the path in a sharp turn. Easily missed by many I am sure. Looking over the valley I point out Angles Rest and where I think Doc’s knob is. There’s Pearisburg way off in the distance. Check out how green the farm land is below blocked off with boarders of woods. We take if all in, ha this is the life. A lizard suns on a rock beside us. Hiking back the day just gets pretties all the time. Warmer with the cold wind subsiding. We catch back up to the young boy and his dog. He’s still making his way to the hostel and so are we. Letting him go on in front we continue our return trip to the car.Finishing up close to 1:30 we grab our cameras and head on down to check out Miss Tilly’s old place. Grand-daughter, Neville and husband Michael are hard at work. She brings out pizza on a large wooden board and a cup of milk in a mason jar to a hiker. Hey it’s Blue, the young boy. He hadn’t a trail name to date but wearing blue jeans we say call him Blue and so it is. Michael waters his garden, raised boxes of veggies and herbs neatly in two rows. The hold log home has its new additions with modern kitchen inside along with massage parlor, sauna and nice setting room. Out back they are building a hiker area with a pizza safe for cooking as they wish. Running water from the side creek is piped to the home and bunkhouse and heated with an outside stove feed with fire wood. So keep her fed and you have hot water for your duration. NICE!! These two have a real treasure up in them thar woods. I am truly jealous. I will continue to dream and keep coming back to Sugar Run for a little piece of stepping back in time.","Sugar Run-Woods Hole

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/306805,"Two maps in hand, a compass and a Captain are all you need to accomplish a successful adventure hike in the mountains of Giles County. With a mind like a steel trap he recalls this trail and that trail he road upon some many years ago by way of motorcycle. Up this ridge and down the next they road till the gasoline ran out. We parked a car in Hungry Hollow this morning to hike back to, a park and ride area this side of The New River and outside of Narrows. Then we drove backup Sugar Run Road past Tilly’s Place to the hunters parking area, what is called the Watershed. No hunters at this location today. No white blazes to follow, no blue or yellow either. Just a wide swath cut out of the rhododendrons to lead the way. The plan is to follow this ‘road’ for a couple of miles and ‘turn’ left to find a logging road to put us on the ridge of the mountain. Captain locates his landmarks along the way to assure me we are on the right track. Angels rest is here he points, Narrows is this other side of the mountain. Finding our first rock outcropping to see out I feel much better about it all. Shadows run across the mountain ranges. Clouds casting imagine on the valley. Where’s the rain and thunderstorms forecasted? Glad they aren’t here. Warm Warm it is and I’m loving it. Meandering along the logging road turns four wheeler road making it harder to follow but just enough clearing to make walking fairly easy. No real bush whacking necessary. We find 7 different tree stands from make shift suicide climbs to store bought iron contraptions to logs stacked for a ground blind. One place had a camera set up on a tree to snap photos of whatever animal came to partake of a salt lick left to entice them. Is that a building up there? Yep a house with power and tv antenna. We peep inside and find it is nicely kept with a woman’s touch. Granny blanket on the bed and nice furniture, labeled Mac’s Place. Seclusion. We carry on.It’s getting about noon and the power line is spotted. That should be it Captain says, Sentinel Point. The woods open up to a clearing and we can see all of Narrows, The New River, and Rick Creek. How pretty! Over our shoulder the ridge of Angel’s Rest where we have had lunch before too. The story is this point was used by the soldiers to lookout for the Yankees coming into town. They say canons where brought up here too. Holy Cow what a task that would have been as it is 3400 feet down to the river. Speaking of which is our hike off of here. Following the rock cairns we know we are now on Mill Creek trail system. A fellow, Ralph Robertson from Narrows, has created and labeled these trails and done a find job too. Weezer trail guessing that’s the one to the top of Angels Rest. We have to come back and try that one. The trail turns into a pine lain path soft under our feet down down down we go. I hear the creek. Loads of falls we are passing too from the Catwalk Trail. Little purple flowers dot the woods everywhere. Lush and green it has become. We decide to soak our feet, Yep just walk right thru the water of the falls which crosses the trail. Ah feels good, shoes socks and all. We add a rock or two on some of the cairns as we pass them. A snake suns on the trail, which I walk right past! He doesn’t even move for Captain either. Ramps are spotted. We pull one to take home with us. Strong oniony smell and hot hot. Great for cooking. Looking around we find a camp spot near the old Narrow damn and see a native trout floating next to the ledge. Soon out of the woods we realize we have found a new place to come back to and explore more. A little piece of the Captain’s past and trails lain out for the future.","Watershed Parking Below Doc's Knob

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/308035,"Boy you just never know how you’ll get your trail name nor how soon it might change. Heck our new hiker, John, got his in a matter of two miles of stepping on the trail and then again within 3 miles of finishing. Here’s HIS story:A breeze gusts thru the three way above Woods Hole. I set here waiting for the big diesel to arrive. Sunny and cool right now on Sugar Run Rd but am prepared for a hot one today. 13 miles scheduled to hike with us walking the AT first and then a climb back up by way of the Ribble Trail.John is eager to go, has his ‘training pack’ loaded baby loaded. 48 pounds worth. Yep no typo 48 HEAVY Pounds. He’s preparing himself for a big hike in September to Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa and the fourth highest of the 7 summits at 19,000 feet. Eyes wide and a big smile John hoists his pack and begins his adventure.Trail talk is abundant from where we are going today to where we’ve been and soon to go. Gear this and Gadget that. Stories begin and heads are down. ‘Watch your head” BAM…. John’s on his ass. I had just passed under this fallen tree and thought my warning was loud enough and in time to save him but NOT. His noggin smacked it solid with a sound like Babe Ruth knocking a home run with a wooden bat. Setting flat of his back Captain asks if he knows what hit him? “Where’d that come from?” I help him up as his pack has him some what hemmed to the ground. The trail names start flying and Knob Knocker is born.Trekking along the ridge our day is warming fast, hazy but with a slight breeze. Many thru hikers are pasted as we head south. All are destined for Maine but will settle for Woods Hole for this day’s end. They are lightly packed. Hey John notice they have all they need and NOT carrying 48 pounds. House, food, water, stove, clothes, bed….30 lbs max. Some looked as light at 25 and moving fast. 4 ½ miles in we stop at the overlook and Captain shows us our location and proximity to all landmarks. Angels Rest here, Docs Knob there and Butt mtn afar. We are all smiles even ol Knob Knocker now that he has time to rest his back from his heavy load. He has stayed right with me, step for step. Impressive. I sure hope he will last I think to myself.Giving him my sticks to try out we head on out the ridge and make our way for Wapiti shelter for our lunch stop. This will put us over half way and near water if needed. The air is no longer cool just warm. Walking down hill we are sweating. John turns the stick back over to me so he can use his arms to leverage relief on his back, shoulders, you name it. I hear his stomach growl it’s time to get him to this shelter for a break. I quicken the pace once we hit the forest floor. Rhode tunnel now for a ½ mile. I know we are close. There’s the break of light from an opening, it’s the turn off the trail to the shelter. John crashes, pack off, shirt stuck to his back with sweat. Dog tired man. Too tired to eat. Almost out of water. I see the light that was once in his eyes dwindle. Captain told him early don’t try to keep Martha’s pace, she’ll kill you. I hope I haven’t. He has done a great job so far considering but I am worried and try to convince him to pore out some of the sand he is carrying for weight. Lighten the load by 20. He is determined. 6 miles to go, 3 more hours. He picks up his water bottle almost empty “I am in trouble” You’re telling me. Just before leaving a tiny little gal comes in for her break. Butter, from Atlanta. She is loving the Virginia mountains. We wish her well, who knows we may see her at the top of the mountain we just hiked off of. See we’ll intersect back with the AT at our 2 mile to go mark. But that never happens…..Reloaded with water off we go. John is somewhat concerned about us just drinking from the stream but Captain assures him all is well. No farmland around these parts. Just cool clear mountain water. Drink up it’s hot.Gusts of wind bring the thoughts that it might blow up a rain but it never materializes. Would feel pretty good right now too. The trail really hasn’t been a rough walk just long. Soon we are at the blue blaze, Ribble Trail. It’s time to climb back to the top “John, you ready? You can wait here for Captain” Captain has already made his declaration he’s takin the road back up. It will add 1 more mile to his trip but taking his chances. The wise ol veteran is hoping for that passing truck to give him a lift no doubt. I encourage John once again to share his load or drop some sand. No can do. Head down he pushes on.Nikon elects to hike with us and Layla stays with her master. Smart girl. Every water hole Nikon lays down in it. Can’t blame I feel like it too. I splash water on my face and get John to do so as well. He must share my water now. He has lost his water bottle. WHAT? Yes it fell out of his pack after we left the shelter. Full, laying some where out there just waiting on someone to take a drink. I know this is just another nail in John’s coffin. The will may be great but the body can only give so much. He has given a valiant effort but enough is enough. The legs begin to seize up. Cramps are setting in. “Martha I have to stop. Wait a minute.” He catches his breath, holds his hands on this knees. 1 of two forest road crossing is coming up. Maybe a truck will be coming past. Holy cow there is one. I jog up to catch them. They offer a ride down but it would be way to far the wrong way. We must pass it up. They give us cold Pepsi’s and water for Nikon. It’s 2:30 now. Captain should be an hour behind us. My mind races. I shall not leave John on his first trip out and go for the car. Would take too long. However if Captain shows soon I could. OR I can get John back up and see if he CAN reach the crest of the mountain. But only if he drops that damn sand. He does and so we go.50 steps. It’s over. The legs are done and so is John. Words of comfort can’t come strong enough help him not feel bad. The thrill of victory of accomplishing 10 miles didn’t outweigh the agony of defeat. His sand poured out beside him he rests his head on his pack as I take his boots off. Legs twitching from fatigue. Nikon gives him a lick as if to say it’s ok.What’s that I hear? A truck… Captain’s voice. Nikon goes to meet him. Our salvation cometh. 2 fellas out joy riding…trail magic. Loaded up and home bound we go. Captain notices the sand. Say is that all of it. Nope “Sandy” still has some left and more at home. Oh no you don’t! No more Sand for Sandy…new trail name by the way. So that’s the story of John, Knob Knocker, Sandy. A hiker to be, with a heart of fire and too much sand in his bag.","Sugar Run Rd- Three Way

Catching up with Tom once again and meeting his wife and friends was a blast. He is still helping out with the outfitters store, MRO, but working behind the scenes so he can enjoy retirement. Sandy takes care of her flower gardens and keeps the town in order so to speak. Their yard was laid out for great camping with cubbyholes for tents to nestle back between flower beds and trees…almost like you were hiding away. Our group was so big we had to take the open side in full sun but that was ok since we brought a canopy and picnic table. Once set up Bonnie, Captain and I began our voyage to gather free give- aways and buy new gear. Shopping was a success to say the least.Friday night we gathered at our canopy for grilling. Before long the Eagle was Flying and so were the tales. Fun was had by all with some ending up in the bushes.Saturday was another warm day with only the evening passing showers like the day before. The rest of the troops arrived. The Ratcliff Clan, Jeff and Ginger. More shopping and then time to prepare for the Hiker Parade. We dawned our very best and marched in style. Captain wore his pigtails and Double DDs pulling off Mother Teresa’s Finest as a catholic school girl. Denny barely fit in his coconuts with nipples peaking on either side depending on which hand he used to talk with. Dustin, Jeff and Ginger sported their Hawaiian flare along with us girls, myself, Bonnie and Noni sporting hula skirts, cowgirl hats and leis…true hiker honeys. The parade was on and we marched with them all. Water balloons flying and squirt guns going off with every turn. Night fell and two full days of Trail Daze took its toll. Some still danced however some just chilled and some just plain crashed early to bed. Again another great time had in Damascus. Tom and Sandy we’ll see you again next year for sure.","Damascus

Feeding nearly 70 hikers was no small feat but we did it and will do it again and again.Festivities started with set up coming together at 10am. Canopies lined the grounds covering tables with loads of food filling them to their edges. Burgers flipped and dogs chard. Hey man, throw me a cold one!!!Our staff consisted of the core crew with a little family flare sprinkled in. It was good to meet all of Captain’s sisters. It’s no wonder he’s a ladies man. Even a hiker or two joined in as staff helping with anything asked of them. They all were much appreciative. By mid-day the place was hoppin with activity. The zipline across the creek was burning hot with friction as packs and people came to shore. Tents went up in every level spot and hammocks hung from every tree. 40+ counted. Even The Straggler made an appearance. Yes Harry flew all the way from Kansas. He wasn’t our farthest hiker, but a chick from Australia was. Anyway he said he couldn’t miss such an event. Missing Trail Days was enough. A big treat this year was home made ice cream. Mr. Gary Williams rolled in with his ice cream making machine propelled by a hit and miss engine. Kaaa Pop click click click Kaaa Pop it would go. Add some strawberries and heavy cream yumm yumm. Eyes lit up like Christmas lights. In addition of our normal cornhole game and volleyball we added some new activities… the Hiker Olympics, check these out….Bear Bag Toss, throw that line over the limb for a win. Nature Hunt, finding a list of specimens for points, some carrying more weight than others. Like 10 points for a Galax leaf to 40 points for a live crawfish. All About Aluminum turned out a creative crowd with the winner sporting foil underoos and a Madonna fashioned bra topped off with sparklers. NICE. Backpack Scavenger was a hiker’s version of Let’s Make a Deal with Monty Hall. Let’s see what ya brung. From Tabasco and unusual food supplements to a kitty cat and ear plugs we discovered hikers can carry an array of personal necessities. Limbo pulled our agile hikers to the forefront front. Rock and Roll who was 6 foot + got down and dirty with the pole and almost cleared to win but a little gal snuck off with a win and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. Yep B&Js were prizes for our winners and hiker’s craving dream. Our only team event was Waste No Water with 3 participants relaying water from the creek to the final bucket seeing who could fill the fastest. Next year we may have to add tubing to the list. We did plenty of that but not for competition.As the sun started to set the crowd gathered around the campfire and the music turned up.

The Captain and I connected just about all the trails lain in the Mill Creek System that we hadn’t walked last time clicking off about 7 miles. It has been about a month since we last hiked and it sure felt good to get back in the woods. A fresh morning with the remnants of a night rain still on the leaves. Mill Creek runs right beside us as we take the Catwalk trail up to Wheezer area. An appropriate name of both, with the Walk setting us right on the edge of the hill, rock steps to maneuver over. Then Wheezer is just what you expect, straight up grade with no rest spots just stop in your tracks and grab a tree to lean against, catch your wind and start up again.Angels Rest is just above us actually and the AT runs across the ridge we almost crest. We decide to check out an area called Camp Rock which is supposed to be along our next path, Piney Road. We search and search but no camp rock found. However we did discover some really cool plant called Indian Pipe or Corpse Plant. It has no chlorophyll and is translucent white. If picked it will turn black and decay quickly so I have just read. Also along Piney Road I decided to try out my newest purchase, a pair of Earth Aquatix water sandals. Got them for Maine and those big water fords so let’s see how they do in the Virginie mountains. Strapped on with a toe guard and firm light soles I step into the creek. Captain coaches me to get on out in the current, so far so good. Deeper and deeper I go almost to my shorts. Nice, so slippage. Nikon and Layla bark at me as if to call for help, Timmy’s in the well, Timmy’s in the well, Get help Captain!!! I return to shore safe and sound. Sold!!!! And boy did that water feel refreshing too. We sweated like crazy so far with the humidity and climb. Back at the junction we take Afterthought trail back to Wheezer. Still climbing a bit too we finally break out of the under growth of Rhodes into ‘real woods’. Just like being on the AT. Heck we are on the AT….the OLD AT that is. Yep it used to run right thru here Captain says and sure enough we see a faded double white blaze. I realize now how far we have trekked, Angel’s Rest ridge is 200 yards from us….1500 feet that’s how far. The rains did catch us while out but was a pleasant cool down. What’s the difference between sweat wet and rain wet anyway? Smell maybe? The grassy path of the upper Wheezer was a good stop for lunch just as the showers moved on. With only a few vantage points to see out we did see Sentinel Point and The New River winding thru Narrows. Down Down, Rocks Rocks, this is one rough patch. The return hike to our car byway of Wheezer was slow going but good training for us. Captain’s new knee brace got it’s first full workout and developed an high pitched squeak. ‘Hey Tin Man you need some oil?’ Glad we’re going this direction. Oh but just wait we’ll try hiking up it next time or they don’t call me Lead Dog, with a truck labeled HikUpit for nothing!!","Mill Creek-Narrows

Today is a bluebird day with high clouds dotting the skies. It’s gonna be hot but just not at humid as a valley hike would have been. Nikon and Layla work over some horseman passing along on their ride. Bristled backs and barks of warning, the animals move on in different directions.

One little guy led the way putting the slowest in front to keep the pack together. His arms dangling from his sides, feet shuffling along as if to say are we done yet. Loaded with sleeping bags in trash bags and framed packs sticking above their heads they do greet us with a smile when we ask how far they have walked. Proudly saying we’ve been out for 3 days!!!Rocky uneven path under foot give us a good indication that this will be a perfect training day in preparation for our Maine hike. I remembered my gaiters today to try out with my trail tennies. I don’t even know they are on. Light and vented. Worked perfect. Rhodes surrounded us but none with bloom. Yes we missed that. Must have bloomed like 2 weeks or so ago. A few Catawba Rhodes around though. Hikers were moving around at the gap getting their day started after having spent the night. Saw a few thru hikers but mostly weekend warriors. Coming this way early in the day we missed a crowd. Cutting off from the AT we connect to Pine Mountain Trail which used to be the old AT’s route. Rocky trail at the start with loads of steps and views then turns us into a twisted wrangled path lined with ferns. Quite nice having some shade at this point. We have this trail to ourselves. After about 2 miles we see the open fields again arriving back to the AT. Larry’s trail name spot just above Orchard Gap Shelter, Hey Left Turn Leon, wrong way. We have lunch and watch a few thru hikers pass by. We are about half way, 6.5 miles to go on our loop.I thought we might see some ponies at this point and sure enough we do but they are too far in this thick brush to go up a take a picture. Heck this morning’s sighting they were moving so fast I couldn’t get my camera ready in time. A stampede of about 15 or so blew by us just as we entered the climb to Wilburn Ridge. Maybe later…Coming into the Scales we are now totally exposed to the sun for the next 2 miles or so. Even the shade trees are small due to harshness of the winds that blow here all the time. Just a slight breeze for us though. Short shrubs come to our waste closing us in from any circulation. The sounds of bees hunting nectar surround us. A few mountain flowers pop up above the shrub line. I can see for miles. Even the puppy dogs take every opportunity to hide from the heat. Once I crest the ridge I find a Noni rock to take in the view from and wait on the Captain. High-lands this place sure is as the mountain ranges roll on forever with me setting in the catbird seat taking it all in. God is Good. Finally we reach the shade of tree cover, now if we can just get to that Big Wilson Creek. That’s gonna feel gooood! A cool drink and a wet towel on the head, nice. The dogs take a dip and I sure think about it but decide getting my shoes and feet wet might not be the best as we have 3.5 miles to go. Say Captain, which way you going? Sign says ¼ mile to Grayson Highlands. Without hesitation he’s off on this flat fire road the way the sign points. “I’ll have the air condition on for ya he shouts out”. You can guess which route I’m a takin..Yep the longer one. Nikon is indecisive and is back and forth between us but soon turns back for Captain and Layla. It’s 2:44, I speculate I’ll be at the car at 4:00, I have 3.5 miles to go. I love the challenge.Passing Wise shelter I meet a few gals hiking alone too. One was a day tripper and the other a thru-hiker who had just taken a plunge in the branch and was dripping off before putting her pack back on. Hiking alone reminded me of our long trips when we get a little far apart. It’s different as you are more a tune to all sounds and I tend to walk a little quicker pace as if I need to for some reason.Finally I settle into my normal pace and am clicking along quite comfortably. Hitting the grads with stride and coming close to yet another open field. I am close to my junction back at Massie Gap. More people appear starting their hikes. Wonder if Captain IS really back at the car. I even looked at the map to see if I could figure where that ¼ mile sign was leading him….looks like to just the edge of the park. Scanning the mountain ranges I spot the Pinnacle. We saw this leaving out this morning so I know I am close. I see ponies, YES a pony jam. Folks are gathered around taking pictures as if they were of the queen. Two ponies back their booties up to a trail sign to get a scratch. I pick out a grey fellow to friendly up to and get a photo and give him a rub on the back. Time to see if I’ve beat Captain back to the car. It’s 4:00. The doors are unlocked but none of his gear is here. What up? Humm did he get lost? Did he get a ride? Hell did he die? My mind races so I grab a cool drink and get some shade and wait him out. 10 minutes, 20 minutes. I roam around the parking area in case he’s hit a shade tree with the dogs…then I hear an engine. It’s moving slow and then there…The Captain’s head of white hair appears. He’s loaded up once again in the back of a pick-up truck. This time that shortcut wasn’t so short. He ended up walking from a campground back to the car before catching that ride.So the moral of the story today boys and girls is never trust a trail sign and be careful if you follow the Captain on one of his shortcuts.","Massie Gap Loop Hike

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/319174,"So how far does this trail go? If we keep walking where will we end up? So do the white blazes run both ways? How far are we going today? And you do this more than one day in a row?Yes Yes all good questions from my little pack of newbies hiking their first hike on the Appalachian Trail. There names as follows in order of hiking position: TJ-Anna’s boyfriend, Anna-Skyla’s best friend, Skyla- Larry’s daughter, Crystal- Shirley’s daughter,Captain’s girl friend. The questions went on for the first few minutes then the trail takes us up a steep little grade and the chatter fades. “Best to keep our energy focused on this trail,” Skyla states. No need to waste a breath. A hot hot day with absolutely no air stirring. Even the shade of the trees offered little relief as we made our way to the knob. Dust rolled from our shoes as we walked the trail. Winding down deeper away from the parking area I can tell they are wondering why are we going down if McAfee is up? Ahhh what goes down always leads up! Hey Lead Dog where’s the warning about the overhead? Yep Knob Knocker is back with us for the first time since his sand tote’n days. No he didn’t wack his head again but came close two times and let me know about not warning him. He now has a 30lb weighted vest which is much more conducive for balance and then carries his pack over it. So now at about 40lbs. WOWClosing in on Catawba Shelter word comes thru the line that Anna needs ‘a break’. Showing her the way to the privy we others take a look at the shelter and get an overview of how hikers accommodate one another in this three sided lean-to. “I can’t do, I just can’t”. Anna decides that privy use isn’t for her and declares she can wait!!!Onward we go with several other little groups of hikers spotted along the way. TJ stays close behind me keeping a good pace with the girls falling in right behind, then John and Captain. Winding our way around the mountain making our way closer to the half way mark the bunch begins to grow tired. Sweat is flying and water is gulped. ‘Are you even out of breath? Crystal exclaims to me. This is worse than the gym or any stair master I’ve been on. Can you see my smile right now? The blue sky becomes more prevalent thru the tree tops we are almost there. See the sign up ahead TJ? that is it, McAfee Knob. Bursting thru the shrub line path the trail opens wide to all outdoors and Catawba Valley is revealed. The newbies have made the summit. They scamper from rock to rock to peer off her ledges. Sweet feeling of accomplishment.Lunch is had and old trail hikes are talked about. Can we go again? Where can we go next? I love it. They really want to come back. I am pleased. After taking a few photos Captain and I decide to take them off the back side of the trail along the logging road. It’s a wide path and a little different look at the mountain. Adventure hiking we told them since it wasn’t on the AT but ya’ll really know how our adventure hikes go and this really ain’t one of them but they don’t. HA Down Down, Feet start to hurt and cries of my toes my toes begin. Tight tennie shoes and newbie hiking legs are catching up to them. Say why didn’t dad give me his sticks? Skyla asked. I sure could have used them now. He got everything else ready this morning. PBJ Samich, here eat this turkey and don’t you get near that ledge. The sound of the road is heard and I let them know we are soon approaching our end, the parking lot. Yes, Yes we made it, Anna throws up her hands in the air, hallelujah. They can’t get on their flip flops fast enough and I myself am ready to get a cold drink from cooler and splash some iced water on my brow. Ah that good and tired feel was had by all. Looking in my rearview mirror the heads are bobbing as they fall asleep","Rt. 311

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/320073,"8:16 PM   Mau-Har Trail/AT JunctionThe boys are bedding down, bear bags are hung, the sun sinks behind the trees. A hard days hike done and another awaits tomorrow.We met at Shirley’s house before sun-up, 5:30AM. Then drove north to Montebello to meet our shuttle guy at his home Dutch Haus. He drops us at Humpback Rocks Gap by 9:00 perfect. After Captain checks the kiosk map he realizes he has done several miles of the section we intend to start from so we take the blue blaze trail to the Rocks. A most direct route I might add too. Straight the hell up, 1000 feet in less than a mile. Fog has us socked in so no views. Guess the trail gods knew the Captain and I were coming back towards Shenandoah and didn’t want us to see anything like last year. Either way it sure isn’t crazy hot but we manage to work up a sweat.Johnny Knob Knocker stated to worry me considering he brought the 30 pound weighted vest. Oh hell no, you are forbidden from putting that on, I say. Heck he shows up with his gear loaded in a box and some Walmart bags. Hey man “where’s ya pack?” Too funny. He was waiting on some instruction as what to take, so we sort and load on the spot. No worries we got him started at 30 pounds, better than my first trip out. Once on the AT I feel at home and back in familiar territory. I’ve walked this section near Humpback but quiet some years ago. New ground for the boys though. John is hiking along at a very good pace, right on my heels so I step aside and give him the lead. His gait is too much for me. That’s all he needed…less weight to lug, he’s feelin good and he’s gone. An overlook allows us our first chance to see out. Fog has lifted and Stuarts Draft and more seen. Hey there’s Wintergreen Resort lodges setting in the mountains edge. Holy cow and there’s Marilyn Monroe. Well not exactly but it was truly a Marilyn Monroe like moment. A gust of wind bellows up and under the Captain’s kilt and Wa-La, close your eyes boys and girls. We burst out in laughter.Say are these the rocks Denny and Noni threw their packs off of? Yep sure enough the ledge appears and where the heck is the trail? About a 16 foot drop off, the rocks lead us over the edge. Seating down we scoot our way along. I tear my pants in two places, both cheeks. Guess my ass was too much for my britches. Hey Santa can you bring me a new pair?Back at camp 8:36PMJohn is rustling like a cat caught in a corner. The tent moves from side to side. Stuff comes out the door as if he is moving out. “I can’t find my head lamp it was just here”, he professes. I’m rolling with giggles. Say did you hang it in your bear bag of things? Finally it appears on the ground outside the vestibule, all is well now. The night birds chirp.Arriving at Dripping Rocks, our lunch stop, we meet 2 thru hikers from Washington State. They are behind considering most thru’s are long gone by now and they are pulling big miles. 27 due today. WOW! Only 6.5 miles left for us.Clear day now and heating up. But no where near as humid and hazy as the last couple of weeks have been. Thank goodness. The trail has turned to mean rock sections to only tease us with a break now and again back to rocks. A lone columbine remains along the trail and some turks cap lilies too. They dazzle me with bright red and orange pedals glistening with light. Other than that no other flowers, very dry here too.One last climb to conquer before our camp is reached. These 1 mile pulls are hard, Yes you heard me right, hard. 700 feet with no switchbacks. The sun burns down on us. Reeds Gap is coming up next so that has to be the down we’re lookin for. Arriving at camp 3:55, John and I decide to fetch water first. 30 minutes of work it was. The creek is quite slow with a trickle running thru it’s rocks. Small little lizards swim in a hole about 1 inch deep. Hey it’s better than nothing. We manage to get a good bag full to filter. Hey I hear Captain, he has arrived too.Ah feels good to take off the shoes, sweaty clothes and clean up. With some concern John questions the use of the cook pot as a bird bath. “you are gonna cook first, right?” Nope. John quickly learns you do what ya gotta do. Shoot before it was all said and done The Captain had his bath and then John took his turn with the pot and grub was then on. And yes it was good…bath AND supper that it is. A few hikers have passed by on their various journeys since we arrived. Some looking as if they have enjoyed their day, some just flat warn out looking for the road out of here. One guy has walked the Mau-Har loop 13 miles and ran out of water 2 hours ago. We help him out giving him our filtered water. He guzzles down one bottle while we fill another. Dark is fast approaching on him and he has a few more miles to go to his car. Speaking of dark that brings me to o’dark thirty. 8:53PM Hiker midnight.","Humpback Rocks Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/320077,"Camp broke this morning by 6:45am. Up and at’em for an 8.8 mile walk out. I slept like a rock. Listed to my music and remembered like 2 songs and was gone. Only woke once in the night to some wind and feeling cool. John said he woke up cold and had to grab another sheet. Sleeping only with a liner and no bag he was chilly. Captain’s knee is doing fine and the brace is fitting perfectly now new. He gets a jump on us knowing we’ll pass him shortly once we start the climb to the Peak of Three Ridges.“Martha…Martha” I hear john call out. He is making sure my voice back is in the direction he has headed out of camp. I went on behind Captain and do stop but out of John’s sight. A little test to see if he has payed attention to his where abouts. Not long he’s back on my heels and out front. Three Ridges is just like it says The Peak, Middle ridge and Lower Ridge forming 3 ridges. The peak is 4000 feet and we are summiting it early this morning with an hour climb. My legs feel with burn but I do love up and well worth the view. A hazy valley below and miles and miles of mountain ranges. Now for the 3 hours worth of down to the Tye River and our car.The trail is quite rocky and steep. The need for sticks to lean on is a must. Passing Chimney Rock I remember the last visit here and not being able to see but a few feet in front of me. Fog then too. Not today, I am rewarded. Man I can’t wait to jump into that river below. Sweating walking down hill how’s that possible? Well just walk the AT and you’ll see. More rock and more rock then finally some flatter trail, my feet pound and I quicken my pace. I have my second wind. John took a break and I’m gone now. Lead Dog is back out front a runnin. I love this part of a hike. Scanning the forest below as you pass down her mountains walking in time. A sign says 1.7 miles to go, “I can make that” John says. We should be finished by noon and beat the heat.Cars are soon heard, the suspension bridge over the Tye River should be seen soon. Once I see that, game over. The sun twinkles on it’s waters man I’m in. I can’t get my shoes and clothes off fast enough. Well not all my clothes. HA Ol John even is jumping with hast to get wet too. Setting in the middle of the Tye cold drink in hand, man don’t get no better than this! Captain is due to arrive about an hour from now so we don’t get in any hurry to depart from our comforts. We talk of up coming adventures, Maine for me and Captain and Kilimanjaro for John. Some fish jump and a few minnows entertain us too.Sure enough about 12:30 the Captain walks across the bridge bound for a swim too. You could see the steam come off him as he went under. What a way to end a day on the trail.Wait there’s more…there’s Gerties. We saw this little building in Vesuvius on the drive in. Gerties Country Store. All of 300 square feet. A couple of tables for eating in and convenience grocery. Best BBQ around the sign said. And a couple inside looked quite satisfied eating too. They have a restroom but you’ll have to go out back…port-a-john. All ya need. Double burgers ordered and 1 BBQ please and we’re all smiles. Now that’s the way to end a day on the trail.","Maupin Field Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/321143,"Sweat drips from my nose, my legs burn with strain, not a breeze of air stirring. It’s just plain HOT. My pack is loaded with 26 pounds to prepare myself for Maine. I must climb this mountain, I know I can I have many times before just not in the middle of the summer.The trail is quite changed during the different seasons. I’m used to seeing running streams and unobstructed views thru the woods. Now the forest floor is grown up and switchbacks unable to detect. Not a drop of water in the stream beds. Bone dry. I can’t believe it. I crest the first big hill of the day, High Cock Knob. Will I ever get my second wind? I ate a good breakfast but I seem so tired. Man I got 4 more miles and that’s just to the fields. I am already thinking about that swimming pool I plan to jump in when I finish my hike today. Ahh I say to myself feeling the water come over me. A small water source I pass trickles, drop by drop to form a little cup of water. I dangle my hankie in it and wipe my brow. Feels cool and good. My sticks click across the rocks and then a whistle is heard. A human whistle but not like a song, just a short toot you might say. A hiker appears, he’s just come from the ridge and tells me he passed a bear a mile back. He is whistling just to let Mr. bear know he is out here. I trek on and become more alert to every dark stump and sound around me. I never see him.I have the woods to myself and now hiking along at normal Lead Dog pace. Feeling quite good I stretch it out so to speak and make up lost time from the climb. Again I have a hard to judging how far I have come since the trail is so different looking. I can’t see the approaching power lines which give me a point of reference of how much farther. Before I know it the stile to the field is upon me. 5 miles covered in 2 hours and 15 minutes. I’m happy with that as I felt quite slow. I got on the trail at 7:20am it’s 9:30ish. Way too early for lunch right now but time for a break. I find our normal spot on the edge of the field and look off to West Virginia. Hazy day. I watch the numerous butterflies light from flower to flower. Yes, a breath of fresh air cools me down while I power up with some fuel, boiled eggs salted and peppered and some dried fruit. Super Powers!!!All down hill from here. I strap on my pack which is still wet with sweat but if feels good and cold on my back. My plan is to bust trail and walk off in 2 hours. I still scan the woods for that bear but none spotted. I do run into 4 trail workers on the way down. They have cut a few blow downs I had to cross earlier and nice to know the trail is clear now. They have worked hard and show it as their shirts are soaking wet. The smell of Celanese comes closer. A sharp glue smell with a hint of burn to your nose. I am close to the road. Trip time 4 hours 22 minutes. Sweet!! My feet tell me I’ve been walking down for a while as I wiggle my toes from my shoes. Feeling fine I am ready for that swim","Straight Branch Road

The unusually hot temperatures were subdued by the heavy cloud cover making our hike quite nice for the most part. We did work up a sweat mind you but not as bad as it could have been. Arriving at the trailhead by 9AM, yep we got up early baby-some by 5:30, we were raring to go. Captain and I are carrying big packs almost Maine loaded with gear to get some good practice. Miss Bonnie, on the other hand, was quite light carrying only the bare necessities. She gives a big smile as she pops on her pack and tootles down the trail. “So just how far down are we hiking today Martha?” “Guess that means all up after lunch?”A good graded trail made quick work of the first two miles to the shelter. A really cool grouping of orange mushrooms glowed beside the trail under the cover of trees and deep leaves on a bank. A sign tells us about the slaves who lived off this land during the Civil War. There are several more of these informational signs along this section but we only spotted two. An old spring cut back in a bank partitioned up with rock was spotted and some rock built fences for boundaries. We talked about how folks survived back in those days and how hard they worked to do so. A few hikers were packing up at the Brown Creek Shelter but looked in no hurry. I’m sure they had a damp night with all the rain from the day before. (Hope that ghost didn’t get them like Noni when she stayed at this shelter one night) She said he danced on her sleeping bag. You sure that wasn’t Denny, Noni?We pass over a few well built bridges and soon come to a sign, 3 miles to the reservoir. WHAT? Thought we only had 2 miles to go? You guys know the story, maps and trail signs never agree and Lead Dog is under attack once again. Orange salamanders appear under foot as we try not to squish them. Newts I think are their main name. Not bigger than your pinky blending in with twigs and leaves they are hard to spot ahead of time. Other wild life popped out today too. Bonnie and I caught a deer listening to us up ahead on the trail. Ears perked and tail tucked. Then Captain got a shot of an egret feeding on fish in the stream. He watched her bob for food.Closing in on the Reservoir we could see the calm waters and boats along the dams outside rim. A voice or two was heard from far off but we never saw anyone. The trail was so different looking coming into the swinging bridge I couldn’t believe I was there already. No rain still so we could sit on the well placed rocks in the grass for lunch. Not burning hot either so no swim time necessary either. Comparing lunches and sharing a little too we get fueled up for our hike back to the car. We should be there by 3:30, the girls that is, and Captain by 4. You know you can never rush a man and especially an OLD one. HA Hey just kidding. The Captain has his speed and I have mine. Everyone in between just pick your spot. Bon Bon pants behind me and I wipe the sweat popping up on my nose. My lunch is belching up in my throat. I hate when that happens but guess that’s better than the other end. Look out Bonnie!!! Passing back by the shelter we only have that last 1.8 miles and a steeper grade. Wow didn’t remember that from this morning we say. Drying off at the car us girls get changed before Captain arrives or the next car passes by. Hee Hee Click Click I hear his sticks on the highway. 4:00 sharp, everyone is on schedule. His shorts are glistening; did he jump in the creek I wonder? Heck it is sweat. He rings out his shirt too, heavy. Holy cow the Captain’s melting. A cold soda goes down and wet clothes start flying lookout highway the Captain is ‘coming out’. No worries that shirttail saved us all. Once again laughter fills the air on a foggy mountain day.","Rt.60 Buena Vista

Every time I travel Rt. 100 early in the morning an old farm house and barn catch my eye. So this morning I stopped to take a photo of each. I love this old house setting just off the road, neat as a pin, calling me to set on her porch and watch the day go by. Then there’s a barn set back in a holler with cattle grazing on a hillside. Dew heavy on the fields and early morning sun shining golden on the barn’s wood. Peaceful.Peaceful too is the drive up Sugar Run Road putting you back on the mountain’s country road. Woods Hole Hostel is buzzing with activity this morning. Hikers are loading up after breakfast to start another day on the trail and a few cars are parked around. Maybe some weekenders have stayed there as well. I drive on up to the trail head. Captain is due any minute. John waits at Angels rest for us. Wow a full house up here at Angels. The Konnarock crew is working along with the Roanoke Trail crew so parking was scarce. Yukon Charlie was there. Remember him from Pine Swamp shelter work? Well he has been sick had looked to have lost 40 pounds or so. Quite feeble looking but none the less ready for a day’s work. They are relocating the entrance here and have already moved rocks and trees to do so. Dropping off some equipment for them on our way end we begin our 10 mile day. Hot, Hot in no time as we make the ascent on the mountain. I have forgotten my dew rag to wipe sweat from my face so just let it drip off my nose. Steams of sweet run from my knees into my socks. John is loaded with his weighted vest and pack. I’m the lightest today with little more than water in my pack and food. Captain and I both have our big trip packs for Maine at home ready to be shuttled with Shortcut come this Friday. We are excited man. One last climb and the rest is reached and we look off over the New River and Pearisburg. Captain should be 20 minutes behind us so we go on up to the next overlook and wait for him. Hawks drift high over the valley as we take in the view hazy as it is. Ridge walking now with a few deer sightings. Sure is nice thru here Martha I know there has to be a hill soon John says. Then he stops abruptly in the trail. “What is that?” Deer guts I think? Bunch of snakes? Humm, we gather for a closer look…mushrooms gone bad. Yep three big piles of large shrums all twisted up in knots, black and slimy. Yuck. Let’s move on.Powerlines past and time to come off the mountain and walk amongst the rhododendrons. Lunch break first. From fried chicken to spam we have the grub any hiker would be happy to eat. 5 more miles to go. Captain waves good bye as john and I disappear into the woods. See ya at the car. Up a knoll and down another the trail seems to be repeating itself. “Seems like we’ve walked 10 miles since lunch John states” and I agree. The treadmill just keeps on going. I know the shelter is up here soon. I start counting mushrooms at this point for distraction. They are many and wild in color. Some looking like a science project gone bad. Finally we reach the shelter and make the sharp cut back left from this forest road into the woods. Berry bushes swallow the trail. Rocks clutter our path making each step tactical. Winding to the crest a breeze cools me and I begin looking for the cut off for Docs Knob. Have I passed it? Sure enough I did, drats, sorry John we’ll have to see it another time. A different kind of treat was had though…fern gully!!! Well that’s what I called it anyways. Bright green ferns covered a whole hill side brushing our legs as we walked down the trail. It was like the trees had stopped growing within the fern patch and boarded on the outside. Is that the road John asks? Yep we’ve made it. The Captain comes along shortly there after, his sticks once again announcing his arrival before he is seen. “Don’t ask Martha?” he shouts out. What? What would I ask? What those berries are? Finally nature has stumped the Captain. Not blueberries, not autumn olive, he doesn’t know. As John put it earlier in the day, we can’t just make it up when the Captains close.

Sat on the tarmac at 7AM when a bell goes off “Sorry we have a maintenance ‘Problem’ you must un-board”. What? I’ve worked myself for this second time flight and you have a problem holy cow.

The hike today was supposed to be for 15 miles and we didn’t come close. Try 10.4. 15 miles no problem I thought. Get to the trail by 8:30 and get to our scheduled shelter (Long Pond Stream) by 5:30 and that would have been with an hour for stops and lunch like usual. NOT. Hell it took us 3 hours to hike 2 miles and the next thing I know 9 hours to complete the 10 miles we did do. Breakfast this morning got us super charged. 2 or 3 of everything Jean and Emerson announced. They are helpers of Dawn the owner. They cook and shuttle. Eggs, French toast, tators, sausage, bacon. The thru-hikers all got 3 of everything and some refilled after that. WOW. Captain and I got two and Shortcut went light weight with one. We got to know the NOBO’s heading for our same destination, Katahdin. Who knows we may summit with them I thought. Surely we’ll at least stop at the same shelters as some anyways. Emerson dropped us off at Rt. 15. We were stoked. We are actually walking in Maine, we made it. A sign warns us shortly into the woods of the severity of this section, the 100 mile wilderness. We aren’t worried. We have planned. We have prepared. We are ready. Rocks and Roots dominate the footpath. We scramble over rock ledges and then look around for another white mark. This Maine trail is quite different from anything I’ve ever experienced. You just can’t make any time. Stairmaster hell I summise.Natural ponds are everywhere. I wanted to take a picture of everyone but didn’t want to burn my camera battery on the first day so I refrain. The scenery does take you mind off of how hard you are working to just hike. We spotted a beaver damn and lilies. I even took a picture of moose scat which looks like olives dumped on the ground. I do hope I see a moose. Expecting several fords early into the day were for not. The area here is dry too. We didn’t even have to put on our water shoes till Wilson Stream. Funny they call a river a stream, a creek a brook, and a lake a pond. What’s up?I had separated myself from Shortcut and Captain for about an hour so decided I’d better stop at Little Wilson Falls for lunch and wait for them. This falls is listed as one of the highest falls on the trail and I believe it. 40 foot drop down a deep ravine I dare not go to the edge. The flow is quite low too. I’d say in the spring this would roar loud. A hike from Switzerland arrives, Hey it’s Matterhorn. He was at breakfast this morning too. He hiked the AT in 2001 and is back to ‘enjoy’ what he missed on his mad dash to the end. He is meeting folks at Gulf Hagas near West Branch of the Pleasant River two more days from here. Also coming by are the brother and sister we met at Shaw’s. MC-Major Chaffage is completing his thru hike and his sister has been on the trail with him for 6 days now. Captain and Shortcut arrive and enjoy a cool drink from the stream and cool off with me. We soon realize our miles per hour are being chewed down to about 1 ½ miles and hour or less. Getting to Long Pond Stream Lean-To tonight will be close. We have made a pact to not cross any fords with out the others so our next junction is Big Wilson so I will wait there.Down Down we go from the falls twisting over roots and forest floor ledges. Surely this will let up to ‘trail’ once we hit the bottom. HA Fat chance. Rocks and more roots greet me. I hear the flow of Big Wilson and catch up to MC and sister. I take note to where they cross and realize this ford is not to worry. The waters are only at the calf. However, the tied guide lines tell a different story when the stream is full. They are above my head tied to a tree a good 7 feet or so high. I’d hate to try holding on to them when the water is rolling that high man! So I strap on my new water shoes and make my way across and wait with the others. They are waiting on Fredo who shows shortly and decided to rock hope across. I root for him while his friend make fun and hope he takes a slip. The water sure felt good as it was a warm day and clear skies. 4:00 now and I realize there’s no way we can make Long Pond before dark, that would be 5.4 more miles. So when Captain and Shortcut come across we head for Wilson Lean-to as darkness sets in. Luckily we are tucked in while others begin arriving after dark. There’s not a flat spot in site for a tent and surely none without a root or rock either. We face a big challenge tomorrow-16 miles. We’ll try to flip flop our days. Hard miles expected too with many more elevation changes. Pray for us.","Monson Rt. 15

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/328117,"8:10PM FridayDetermination the word of the day. AKA Blinded by a challenge. I know I can make these 16 miles…But at all costs? As I set here alone I wonder…I prayed..AGAIN. Many times today I said the Lord’s Prayer and asked Him to watch over us in this wilderness. I’ve done some hard things in my life, physical stuff ya know!? But this terrain takes the cake. 16 miles of aches, hands hurt from holding my sticks to balance each step off a steep descent. Some more than 300 feet to 1000 feet with steps longer than my legs could reach without thudding the ground with impact. 8:26PM   A NoiseI hear someone approaching. My head lamp shines out from the shelter into the night. I say, “Captain is that you?” No I’m Buckeye the voice says. He comes in and tells me he has seen my 2 buds back around Fourth and Third Mountain. They are safe. Shortcut is camped at the base of Fourth Mountain and Captain was just starting up the front side of Fourth close to where I had lunch today. He told Buckeye he was bound for Chairback but that was 2 ½ hours ago. He will see Shortcut and hold up there I am sure. That puts them 4 miles from me in the morning. I had left them a note on a tree saying I would get to Chairback and wait for them tomorrow and decide what shelter would be next for us. I started to write how I would handle my first night in a shelter all alone. All my other trips have always been in a tent but since Buckeye is here we shall talk. He is from Denver and trying to catch up with MC and Sister. These two hikers we met at Shaw’s. Buckeye is trying to catch them. He’s planning on hiking 28 miles tomorrow. WHAT? Heck he did 20 today. Out of water he heads down to the source which I opted out from when I arrived. I had reloaded with water at West Chairback.. I didn’t get a full 2 liters but did have enough for a bird bath in a tablespoon of water and enough to cook. This source was a mile or so back and I was getting close to out there too. Once here I was spent, slap worn out. I really thought I was going to be too tired to write but once I ate I regained some energy and writing away. Glad I packed my down jacket and booties too. The night air is quite cool but I am toasty now. There were some phenomenal views today just like I had read and dreamed about. Barren Ledges for one but one heck of a climb to get there. Just like climbing Everest. Ya know there’s always a price to get to the top, in anything. Well the Slide was the price to pay to reach the Ledges. Rock twisted with roots and then steps so steep I was grunting to push myself upward to make the next ledge. I looked to my side and the trees were now parallel with the slope. You get my picture? STEEP BABY!!! But once I crested the mountain WOW, MAINE opened up. Long Pond stretched the whole valley and bright blue skies greeted me. Fantastic. This is what I came for. Say is that Katahdin out there? I just don’t know. A couple was there and told me where they lived for the summer, a dock spotted way off in the distance was pointed out. Nice, but how the hell did they get up here? I never saw a side trail. They got a good laugh at me talking with my mom by cell phone, County gal at her best.Back to this morning… I was rolling along good from Wilson Valley to Long Pond Lean-To, 4.7 miles and there by 9:20, 4 miles to Cloud Pond Lean To. I had hoped to arrive by 11:20 NOT. With that massive slide of boulders took me extra 45 minutes to make it. 12:15. I take a break and call Captain and Shortcut hoping I can tell them what to expect and where to find me. It’s too early to quite for the day. Heck there’s 6 hours till dusk. No answer. In my mind scrabble I forget to leave a note here. So all they have is a phone message to go on and who knows when they might check that. Of course I realize this a mile or so on down the trail. I have 6.3 miles to Chairback Gap Lean-To. No problem right?Little did I know the next three mountains would be the death of me and us all! There are four dreadful climbs ascending and descending over 4000 feet during this 16 mile range called Barren Chairback. I had already knocked off two Fourth Mtn and Third Mtn how much harder can it be? I thought. Well damn it was. Once I hit Columbus the wheels were slowing and the mind wonders from I think I can I think I can to Can I do this? The light starts to dwindle as evening is approaching I’ll make it by 6:00 I say I have one more mountain Columbus. I trek on. Climb, Climb, Third Mtn complete. I take a quick look across the mountain ranges and move on. Push Martha Push you can make it. Water is running low I know it. I start rationing at this point. Oh but wait what’s that ahead? Yes a water source running right over the trail. I load up however still thinking I’ll have water at the shelter do not completely fill everything. I wish I had later as you already know. A sign tells me I have just summited Columbus Mountain. YES. My legs are jello and I still must work my way down to a shelter some place below. Has to be right here, my altimeter says so. A few more 100 yards and finally it appears. I have made it. Took me 12 hours to come 16 miles. Yes believe it.","Wilson Valley Lean To

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/328119,"8:15AM SaturdayI slept pretty well last night. Too tired to care what hurt and have many bruises from the boulder navigations. Buckeye left out at 5:30 this morning just like he said he would. I tried to sleep in but just napped once morning light came. I am just waiting now for the Captain and Shortcut to come in so we can see where the trail takes us next. I figure them to arrive about 9 or so if they get moving like usual by 6:00am. So to pass time I am drying out socks and under-roos in the sunlight. It’s still cool in the shade so I am searching for sunlight as well.10:00 rolls by then 11:00 Now I begin to check my maps to see what our plan might be since their arrival is coming on to noon. There’s no way we can make the 10.7 miles scheduled for today. We are supposed to come to a river, West Branch, maybe we can camp there? We’d have water and could see how far we might make it next. We are already 1 day and half behind which makes food shortage a good chance before reaching White House Landing. I hear footsteps, its Shortcut but no Captain. He is a good hour behind her she thinks. They did tent together but Captain didn’t come in till dark and was completely out of water and what little Shortcut had they rationed. They barely ate supper and breakfast so their energy levels are shot. Luckily they hit the same water source on the way here as I yesterday but once dehydrated hard to recover and push on too. Captain comes in close to noon and is ash white. He doesn’t look good and lies back in the shelter like he wanted to just die. Well he didn’t but sure felt like it. His knee is blown out. Done. Bone on bone. He must come off the trail. Ideas toss around from me taking Shortcut’s tent and continuing on, to us camping at West Branch River, to looking for a road out. We decide me hiking on is not the answer I don’t feel good about that it anyways. We came together we’ll leave together. A SOBO General Sherman comes in to the shelter and tells us it ain’t no better this a away and we will come to a road at West branch. This is our way out.We have Chairback Mtn yet to climb today or I should say Shortcut and Captain do as I am rested and ready to go. That’s 5 miles making their day 9 and mine short but I can take care of camp chores and we’ll see what happens. Soon we crest Chairback and enjoying what might be our last view. White Cap mtn standing way far away. We were to hike to it tomorrow. It would be our best view of Katahdin so the maps say. It does look daunting. Two gals are eating lunch, Grandpa and Trouble with their dog Inga. They have started in The Whites I think and are in trail shape by here. We ask them to take one last group shot of us with the remaining 100 mile wilderness in our background. We tell them we’re coming off the trail but will be back. One last descent for all times sake. A drop off boulders that would make your eyes bug out. Does the trail crew here just enjoy terror? I mean it. I had to set down and reach with me foot to the next landing and oh boy don’t get your weight going forward or your gone man. I thought I took a picture of this area but I guess my camera was scared too and didn’t open its eyes either. Shortly I run into two young fellas dayhiking and notice their shirt logos, AMC. Appalachian Maine Club. Yes they might help us out and sure enough they are camped down by Long Pond with a group trained for just what we need, rescue. We are instructed to hike on down to West Branch road take a right and hang at the Gulf Hagas parking area. A truck from AMC will be back for us at 5:00pm and give us a ride to nearest town, Greenville.I have to say once this plan was set into motion my heart sank. It was over, a year’s planning was over. Walking out so soon after we started was never a thought in my mind, tears started to whale up. I feel I have failed and also failed my fellow hikers. If only I truly believed this section was this hard. No I thought I WILL be back and WILL hike the entire 100 miles in entirety. This is just a stumbling block with much knowledge gained. I will return.Arriving at the road I find the parking lot and realize it’s just like a day at McAfee at home. Cars parked everywhere with folks walking around like ants. Who would have thought? Wilderness? This is grand central. I had to TRY and find a secluded spot to take a quick bath in the river. Felt good too. It would have been our second big ford but water was low here too. At this moment I wished for our trip whole. The shelter stops with conversations of the day’s hike and of course a dip in a creek with water fights, to wind down together with friends and thru hikers. But the start of our journey was just too tough, the mountain won and turned us back to town.So what do we do from here? Day hike as we can, spend a zero day just like the thru-hikers, go back at it again. Thanks Ron from AMC and the boys. Thanks Buddy from Shaw’s, the shuttle man who knows every back road in Maine.","Chairback Gap Lean To

Buddy got us from Greenville stop and go and delivered right back where we started, Shaw’s. We didn’t get our same room but instead stayed in the bunkrooms which were just fine. About 10 single bunks upstairs with us in one corner area. Dawn checked us in last night.We talked with her and Buddy about shuttles to various places in the wilderness and our options. Shortcut lined up a shuttle to retrieve her car in Newport which would have been placed perfectly for our travels to Bar Harbor but we have several days till then so getting the car now is best. So our plan tomorrow is drive to Millinocket and stay at the Appalachian Trail Lodge and get more info about camping along the trail for day hikes. FUN. We’ll have the best of both worlds.","Shaw's

Saturday in Monson, Sunday drove to meet Caribou John in Augusta to pick up our day packs and release him from his shuttle duties since we have wheels now. Thanks for all your help John we’ll be calling on you again next year too. Then from Augusta to Millinocket a town 20 miles from Abol Bridge aka the Golden Road, the end of the 100 mile wilderness. How ironic, we are camped now at the foot of the mountain, Katahdin. The prime campsite of this campground and just steps from the finish of the 100 mile wilderness we were going to walk. What luck!Last night we stayed at the AT Lodge where Jamie and Sticker helped us to our bunkroom and gave us advice on where to camp. Once again another very clean and nice hostel with all you need, shower, towels. We ate dinner at the Pellenter Restaurant. You know the show on Discovery Channel, American Loggers!! Yep this is where it all started for the loggin family and now they are on TV. The Golden Road is the route they run to transport there logs from the lands surrounding the AT to town. Believe me this road is worn hot with them from 3:30 AM till late at night. We could hear the trucks from our camp spot gearing down. Anyways back to the restaurant, yummm, ribs and ate like I’d really been on the trail for 9 days already. So much for losing those 15 pounds. I’ll have to settle for just a few. This morning ate at The AT Café, also owned by Jamie, great omelets and homemade breads. Two thru-hikers came in having summited the day before. Mom and Dad proudly announced their son’s accomplishment with photos. Tiles signed by other finishers lined the ceiling with a new one in place for others to sign as they come in. So our plan now is to enjoy our campsite here at Abol bridge for 3 nights, Day hike the AT and then summit Katahdin Friday. The weather forecast is perfect too. Clouds to move out today and sunny all week.Maybe we shall here the loons tonight across Abol Stream, it runs right in front of us. 8:00PM   Dusk at CampWe had a nice walk today to loosen up the legs from our zero day, ha. 8 miles out round trip to a stream ford north of here. So we got some AT miles marked off and met a few hikers. 2 guys hobbled so from the wilderness walked side to side like weeble wabbles. One guy said his feet felt like he’d been walking shards of glass AND hot coals. Pulling 20 mile days…WHY? They had 10 more miles to go and it was 4:30. No problem as he put on his crocs and ate a hotdog and waddled off.We on the other hand are loving hiker life easy style-enjoying our view of the mountain while cooking our camp food watching the sun set. A loon flies over, calls but doesn’t stop. An egret just lands in the water way and we watch her stalk her prey. The mountain turns pink with evening light. Some kayakers paddle out late.Very peaceful tonight, a fish jumps and ripples grow wide. Wiper-will, Wiper-will, a bull frog burps. It don’t get no better than this. Once again we have been blessed.","Millinocket AT Lodge

Night noises have subsided, just the Captain purring and Shortcut farting haha. I don’t make night noises. Then I hear a rustle thinking it is Shortcut. No different now, ka-splash, ka-splash. Something is walking thru the water. Our tents set just 10 yards from the shore. “Captain something’s out there- wake up!” My heart pounds…A massive image, a dark black image emerges from the water. His legs raise him to the bank. Antlers tilt side to side. He pays us no mind. His silhouette stands large in the moon light and walks right by our tent’s opening. Sauntering on towards Shortcut’s tent I think oh lord he’s gonna step on her but walks on into the woods. Wow it happened; a moose sighting and a dang close too. 5:35PMWashed and clean after a nice hard day’s hike to ready ourselves for the summit Friday. That’s about all we can do-prepare. Knock off some sections and enjoy.After our moose visit last night we were anxious to see what the day had in store. We hit the trail at 7:30 right from our campsite, no driving necessary. Off to Rainbow Ledges for a different view of Katahdin. We left Captain taking photographs from the bridge and setting off on his own journey via car. The trail warns us again of heading into the 100 mile wilderness (north end sign). Yep we know, jokingly. So now we walk south into ‘trouble’. Reminding me of home the trail starts peacefully into a wooded path and then Maine hits. Roots, rocks, ouch my feet. We run into a father son combo we ate breakfast with at Shaws day 1. They have made it in 6 days, wow. Some we met did so in 4 days. What? We congratulated them.I can tell I am walking stronger today. 2 miles an hour maybe less. Yes we arrived at Hurd Shelter which is 4 miles in 1 hour and ½. Well easy said since not loaded with packs and had rest too. Shortcut’s feeling fine as well. Captain started with us briefly this morning just to test the knee but didn’t last long.The trail wound thru some ups and down in deep forest but different than earlier trail, had some openness to it. Once at the ledges I felt revived, a renewed confidence that I could walk this terrain. Shortcut seconded the thought. We sat on the ledges eating lunch taking in yet another view of ‘our mountain’. I called Larry even, how cool we have service from up here. Returning back to camp all I could think about was a dip in the stream. The skies still clear blue with cottony clouds about lovely. I shucked my shoes and ditched my hat and jumped in. Well almost jumped in I waded in; dang it was cold but felt good. Ah hand me a cold one too Captain. Yep with the conveniences of the campground store we had some town treats to get us thru these next 3 days. Ha As I floated in the sun our bullfrog popped himself up on a rock to sun. Bright green he was and quite friendly. I came to shore and sat right beside him. Shortcut came in to camp and joined in for a swim too. A nice ending to yet another day ‘in the wilderness’.","Abol Camp

By 2:00 it set in but luckily we only had to walk about an hour in it before arriving back at Abol.Our day started with a drive into Katahdin Stream Campground. We checked out our tomorrow nights Lean-To rental and it is perfectly located just off the Hunt Trail aka the AT which leads to the summit.Some heavy morning clouds cleared to blue skies and warmed nicely when Captain dropped us girls off to hike up to the falls and then return back on the AT south to our campsite at Abol. He, on the other hand was off to photograph the area. The Falls hike is 1.2 miles up and would give us a taste of what to expect come Friday. A lady following us told of her many hikes all over Katahdin Mountain. She advised an early start and expect 1 hour to climb each ½ mile once we hit ‘the boulders field”. It only took us 30 minutes to make it to the falls and back which made us feel good about our start. Hiking south back to camp would give us 10 more miles today. Following our blazes we make “the” turn on the perimeter road just like the map indicates but we both notice no blazes along the road. What’s up? We retrace our steps and still come to the same conclusion, keep on the road. The blazes have been grayed out?? Turns out the trail has been re-routed. Oh well we’ll just take this blue blazed trail which we can tell was the old AT as the blazes have been painted over. What an adventure-we pass three beautiful ponds, Daicey, Tracy and Elbow. No moose still. Shortcut pulls her maps out and figures our coordinates and says we will connect to with the AT just up the way. Once back on the white blazes I feel a whole lot better that’s for sure. We make tracks now too some roots and rocks but manageable following a stream for most of the day. I have felt trapped with these Maine forests from day one. I miss climbing a mountain and seeing a valley too. Here it takes all day to emerge from with in and then you walk a short ridge of rocks. Don’t get me wrong once you do see out it is massive wide and wonderful. Just not Virginie. A mother deer and her fawn watch us pass by. Attentively she perks her ears and glances her eyes back and forth watch us and baby. The little girl doesn’t move as warned I am sure.Meandering along this stream which really roars like a river we finally come to our ford. The place we walked to Monday. Putting on our water shoes I scope out my path, rock, rock, wade, rock, log, shore. The water isn’t that cold, feels good to my feet, the current not treacherous but swift enough. I’m across. Shortcut’s turn. A couple of three point stances and she’s over too. We celebrate. Now the sprinkles begin and grey skies fall on us. Rain. Prepared we put on packcovers and rain jackets and trek on.We met several NOBO’s hoping to summit tomorrow. One guy declares he will summit and come down to Roaring Brook and then Friday turn around and hike up Knife Edge and off Katahdin. Wow! Big Double Wammy. 2 Georgia gals we met will see what the rain does and may summit with us Friday. The weather forecast is rain tell mid-day tomorrow(Thursday) and clearing with wind, Sunny Friday. WE HOPE.7:28PM Still RainingComing into camp I scanned the campground for campers with drop out awnings. Ah,ha the folks just above us have one. Looks well set up with a porch too. I stop in to ask a favor. This country gal ain’t shy. “Say can we use your dry area for a shelter to congregate and cook our supper?” Nice native folks from Maine-South Harbor, say sure.So we scamper to get our kitchen stuff, pot and food bags. Dry clothes and roll on in. These retired folks live here during the summer. Have been coming here for 25 years. They tell us of there hikes to Baxter Peak and love their view of the mountain. We clear our mess as they take a drive to ‘town’ for their dinner. Not sure where that was, maybe Millinocket. We head for our tents.Darkness is coming so no star gazing as last night, which by the way was wonderful. We watched for hours and even went up the bridge to take a wider look. Watched the sunset too. Tonight we hunker down in our tents and listen to the steady popping of rain upon our roofs.","Katahdin Stream Campground

The clear mountain stream runs smoothly just below our lean-to. We have it all to ourselves. These shelters line the bank all thru the campground.We broke Abol camp at sun-up using the rain delay as an opportunity to split. During the night heavy showers come and went, so did the local neighborhood bear. He turned over every other trash can looking for that special treat. I couldn’t see him but Shortcut sure had visions of him she told us about. Dreaming can cast a whole different light on a situation.As I packed my gear the thought of where we’d be right now otherwise came to mind-Hurd Brook Shelter and would have been 13.4 miles to arrive to where I set right now. We’d had a full house at that shelter too as we heard word from other hikers at the store. A wet night they said and all are headed to Katahdin Stream or the Birches, the AT hiker camping area.Driving into the park headed for our new campsite we all reflected on how our trip has gone and all agreed things turned out the way they should have-All for the best. We are all safe, rested, dry and ready for the big day tomorrow.Shortcut and I will got in our miles for this trip just the same and all three of us camped 6 out of the 8 nights planned. We will have hiked a total of 76 miles, hiking 8 out of 9 days. That’s 43 miles less than we set out to do and had a zero day. Not bad. Granted we missed the middle of the wilderness but we got to see so much more than we ever would have. Our close-up moose visit, a swim in Abol stream, our night noises, whipper will, whipper will, loons, frogs, deer, oh and those little red squirrels, daring little devils looking for crumbs, our bear, watching Baxter Peak come and go with the change of clouds and all those hikers, some from as far as Germany and Switzerland. Oh and we saw the making of a History Channel episode called Shape of the States. Camera crew was at a store outside the park interviewing them. I just walked up and said ‘hey what you guys filming?” me? Ha nope not this time. 7:50PMOne last look at Big K before night fall. We checked out the register to see if anyone had not come down from today. 7:45 was the last entry off. Earlier today we dried out our tents and gear before we could move in to our lean-to. We noticed all the previously met thru hikers arriving as well. Shortcut and I knocked out that missed turn section about 3:00. 1.5 miles south to Grassy Pond junction. Nice re-location-bright green moss lined the trail with red cedars. Then new bog logs lead us over the marsh.Matterhorn-Swiss fellow we met at Shaws and over lunch our first day was coming in. He was hiking on my same schedule, the 9 day plan. Glad somebody could keep that pace. The GA peaches also were sighted. They were coming off Katahdin. Took them 8.5 hours to go up and back. Most hikers we talked with said to allow plenty of time but it was very doable. I am stoked. Glad to have already experienced these Maddening Maine Miles. Rock slide ascents and eye googling descents.Shortcut is still somewhat skeptical of making it. I know she can make it and I will too. We are determined. We are aimed to depart at 6AM allowing 1 hour per mile in some locations. Forecast is good and clear. I can’t wait.","Abol Campground

Katahdin Conquered. The ultimate challenge thus far complete. We didn’t make it thru those 100 miles but by golly we saw our way to the northern terminus of the AT.
This morning was a mild beginning to what lay in store. We set our course to depart at 6:00 allowing 12 hours to complete the 10.7 mile trek. Hunt Trail aka AT 5.2 miles down Saddle Trail 5.5 miles. A drizzle falls, sure hope this blows out. We say our good-byes to Captain. He’ll roam today and make his way to Roaring Brook to pick us up later this afternoon. ETA between 3:00-6:00 who knows.
Again 30 minutes has passed and we are at Katahdin Stream Falls just like our trial run. Now for new ground. Not long and the trail turns harder much harder. Mist turns to heavy fog and the rocks more slippery. Boulder grow bigger. Larger and harder to maneuver over and around. We reach the cave which is the window to the boulder field and soon above treeline. I compact my sticks and put in my pack. Captain gave me some impact gloves which have padding for gripping NICE. Kept my hands from getting banged up but too bad for the shins as the blood starts to run down one leg. Bashed it one to many times now. Need soccer guards. 
The trail takes a good mile an hour to navigate now. Tree line has protected us thus far but now we have emerged and take a beating. My packa (rainjacket/packcover) bellows in the wind like a parachute ready to whisk me off of here. Shortcut tactfully makes her way up the rocks just behind me. A strong woman she is at 66 years of age. Determined to fight her way up this mountain same as I. After a few rock scampers and some grunts of pain she asked “Are we having fun yet?” with a smile.
Our glasses continue to fog up from the mist and wind AND our body heat. Fog gusts make the blazes hard to follow too. A white abyss is all you see for the horizon. Rocks stacks cattycornered atop one another with blazes leading you to no where. 
“I can’t make it Shortcut. I can’t get up over this big one!” My arms too short to grip a groove my legs to short to hop up. I take a body dive up on the ledge my knees digging for traction; she gives me a hand to put my foot in. I’m up and over. But how’s she gonna make it now? Aaron arrives, a hiker from no where. He sees our dilemma and gives her a boost. Trail Magic!!! Had he not come who knows how we’d gotten up. But where did he go? Shortly after asking his name and if he’d been here before, which he hadn’t, he was gone. He didn’t pass us. He disappeared as mysteriously as he appeared.
Each false summit wears on me. Where’s the tableland, the Gateway to Katahdin? The exit from this boulder field? 
Many hikers have past us now. Most we knew from our acquaintance at Shaws. Matterhorn, Tennessee-Bodacious, The girls from Chairback (Grandpa and Trouble). The girls gave us a big hug once they recognized Shortcut. Her and Captain had given them food to get them thru to Whitehouse Landing. Since we were coming off the trail Captain unloaded his load. They said he saved their lives as they would have been out of food before reaching the landing. 
The fog rolls over the gateway. We are out! But not rid of rocks. Step after rock step leads us closer to the peak. The intense climbing has stopped now just to navigate poor footing. 1077 feet was my starting elevation on the altimeter and 5267 is our destination. We’ve surely come most of that. If I could only see the top. This fog is swallowing us.
Some of the hikers who past us are now returning back off the mountain and greeting us with a big smile. You’re almost there. I feel anxious. I’m really here. How can I have the same right to feel their sense of accomplishment but sorta do. I have dreamed of this day and it is now right here before. Screams of joy come from the fog ahead. Hikers exclaiming joy. 
I see the sign…I have arrived.
Billows of clouds roll across the peak. A ray of sunlight brings blue sky opening wide for me to see below. A Pond A Steam wait what else? Then fog. I keep scanning then again an opening, The Knife Edge appears. Oh how daunting it is. Silhouettes of people top each Edge point making their way to the peak. No way I say, that’s too much.
Shortcut comes in- we take our turn by the wooden sign for our snapshot in time. WE MADE IT!! WE MADE IT!!! We gather with our other friends for lunch as they tell of where they will go from here. Some home, some have no clue and say just back to the bottom. 
Now to get down….
Our plan is to take the Saddle connector (.9 mls) to Saddle Trail down to Chimney pond (5.5 mls) I feel we have done the hardiest part already but little do I know??!!!
Rocks Rocks and more rocks. Baxter Peak is one big mountain of rock. Being above tree line by 1500 feet or so nothing can grow. So glad I’m in my tennie shoes and not my boots. My feet would have been hamburger for sure. 
The connector trail is a scree path with rock cairns to guide us. More people are on this trail which is supposedly the easiest on Baxter. Hell if that’s the case I’d hate to see the others, Abol especially. It’s the shortest approach at 2.8 miles and a true rock slide. Well this IS a rock slide if you ask me. Every step tedious. Don’t look up at the gorgeous view opening up before my eyes. The landscape appearing for the first time clear. I’ll miss a foot hold and tumble to my death if I don’t watch it. So to protect me life I did take some time to just stop in mid trek to view it all. Ponds scattered the land. Shadows from the clouds washed over me. There I see it, Chimney pond. 1.2 miles down to actually walk by it. This pond backed up to the rock mountain surrounding it like the Rome Coliseum. 
Once there I stood in awe looking up like a 2000 feet, wow I came from up there. 
3 miles to go. The smell of Christmas trees engulfs me. I take a deep breathe and soak it in. AH. I talk to other hikers coming and going. Some local and some from other states. A trail ranger who looked about 12 tells me my location when I stopped her to find out. Just curious if the signs are correct and 3 miles is it. Yep she says you’ll be out in 4 hours. WHAT? I’ll prove that wrong. 
On to Roaring Brook. We’ll the brook wasn’t roaring, dry dry. Again I catch myself looking around, see another pond and almost break an ankle as my foot slips between bog boards. These trails are mean, no safe place to step, just a rock wedged between another.
I'm shooting for a 3:30 finish and sure enough do so. Stepping out in the parking lot I scan for Captain. He’s expecting a hootie hoot and all I can muster is a faint hoot hoot. I’m tuckered. I just lay down in the gravels of the lot. He quickly pops a cold one for me and says he has grapes, cheese and crackers for us. Now that’s a finish line baby. 
Shortcut is not far behind me. Give out too but still smiling with accomplishment. One tuff gal she is. Took me 9 hours and 23 minutes to walk 10.7. Wew. She was just 30 minutes or so more. 
We toast our day’s achievement. What a mountain, What a hike, I’m loving life.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Needed to hike the next day to keep that from happened but instead had a night’s sleep back at the AT Lodge in Millinocket and they our drive to the coast.Captain thought ahead yesterday and got our same bunks at the lodge before getting our finish line goodies. So this morning we had laundry done and breakfast by 8:30. Said good-byes to our new hiker friends. Some are heading home on a train or a bus and some are catching rides with hiker families and some flying. They seemed sorta lost gathering around outside waiting. What will I do now kinda look on their faces.Bar HarborCaptain and Shortcut have been here before but some time ago but still recall some sights of interest. It didn’t take us long to check-in and drop off luggage before heading down to the harbor.Wow what a beautiful setting. Boats covered the shore line, lobster buoys bobbed by the 1000’s. I can’t wait to crack open my first crustacean. Speaking of lobster what is a lobster roll anyway? Well I found out. I was told I just had to try one, “they are the best” NOT. Its chunks of lobster mixed with mayo on a hotdog bun. You’re kidding right? When the waitress put that plate in front of me and that’s all I had my mouth dropped open. Hey it was ok good but not all that. I’ll reserve major judgment on real Maine lobster when I get the big daddy. So after late lunch we did a little driving to check out some sights. Cadillac Mountain, the highest point here on Mount Desert Island, Thunder Hole, the loudest cove on the island, and Otter Cliffs, a place where rock climbs repel down to the water’s edge. At each stop we did the tourist walk, photo op and jumped back in our car. Who are we anyway’s? Where’s the hiker instinct to climb that mountain, repel down that cliff? Too tired baby, let’s hit the hotel.","Millinocket

Acadia National Park IS this island and stretches like 20 square miles and we hit it all passing thru little towns and their historic sites. Best of all I saw my first lighthouse up close and personal-Bass Harbor. Again lobster pots as far as the eye could see. This lighthouse was short and squatty unlike our tall ones. It sat along the coast with large orangish rocks leading to the waters edge. We drove up on another area called Pretty Marsh, a place off the tourist path, nice. Tall pines and dense forest reminded me of what we just walked out off back on the AT. The marsh backed into an inlet and we saw two seals swim by. The shore was full of small stones and shells. No real sand here just ground up rocks. Onward making our loop of the island we stopped at every overlook or town’s historic building enjoying a calm day. We hit Thunder Hole again for picnic lunch and watching people get doused with waves.Once back in town we window shopped and asked the locals where they go for their lobster. Ellsworth outside of town is the answer. Boy was I in for a treat. I had no clue what to do. Lobsters are crawling all over one another and line forms to pick yours out. I’ll take a #2 please, That’s Lobsta and pound or so of mussels, ear of corn, roll and slaw. Grab a bib and pic and head for your picnic table or and BYOB. AHH if I’d only known. 20 minutes later my number is called and that big red fella lie on my plate. Shortcut where do I start? Now she is a professional at these things. Took her 1 hour to dissect hers. I watched closely. Let me tell ya it didn’t take no hour for this gal to mow threw that crusty little devil. Claws ripped off, tail twisted and body shucked. YUMMEEEE I swabbed my roll in left over butter and corn kernels like a country girl should. The man next to our table got quite the laugh knowing this was my first lobsta bake. We decided to work off supper by walking across a sandbar which was to appear as the water way along the harbor receded at low tide. It was dusk when we got there and dark by the time we touch our toes on Bar Island. I’d say it was about a quarter mile walk from point to point and the sandbar was wide enough for cars to pass which some did. Not sure how that was allowed but a truck or two did drive out on the bar and back. Next time we want to check out this island and hike around it.","Bar Harbor

Maine is known for its wild blueberries so I had to finally try them in something.   Eating at the outdoor café was relaxing. We kill most of the morning shopping some and checking out every outfitter store on the island.   1:30 was set sail to see the lighthouses in this area. I’m excited and worried too. Got my Dramamine and ginger gum to ward of those waves of motion sickness.Lighthouses here we come. We get in line to board the boat, like the first ones to make sure we get the perfect sets. Well not only to see but for me to make a quick exit need be. Not overboard but to the lavatory. We get settled in and I hold on. It’s a calm day and hot. Once we got moving it was just like riding with my friend Sandra on her boat. Easy going, no troubles.We saw 5 out 7 lighthouses that were close by. One of the 7 we already saw yesterday Bass Harbor. These are beautifully located on the rocky shores. Again not very tall, short and fat. Looking back we see Mt. Desert Island stretching across the horizon. Humm the mountains look taller now. The tour master tells us of famous people living along coast, a financier Bass from NY, Martha Stuart’s home, and The Rockefellers. The puffins have already gone so we don’t get a peek at them. They are the colorful billed birds with black feathers and a white chest. A real pretty little bird. Mostly just seagulls to watch now. Captain takes many photos which I hope to turn into one of my own.Once back on land we just stay at the harbor and eat watching the boats come in for the afternoon.

Also we’ll get an interview with a retire lobsterman.First for the live touch tanks, cool. A gal tells us about the sea animals that usually are caught up in the lobster pots. Sea cucumber, yuk. Size and shaped of a cuke but slimmmyyy, like a jelly fish. Starfishes were neat to hold and see them curl their arms around your fingers. Crabs which we left alone, ouch they’ll take a chunk out of your fingers. Second to the hatchery where 1000’s of embryo start lives to become our meal. HA 50% survive from the hatchery verses 3% from the wild. The hatchery lobsters are only 1 inch long when released thru a vacuum like tube. They just blow them out on the bottom of the ocean. A lot are eaten right away but so many the percentages work. Funny the gal giving our tour was just starting her job her, was from Virginia Beach. Go figure.Lastly we had a laugh with the lobsterman. He was this old dude like the old man of the sea. He was a little slow starting but once he got warmed up was quite entertaining. He’d trapped for many years back when they used wooden traps and buoys. He recalled retrieving pots prior to hurricanes and types of boats best for the seas. We left educated and hungry for another lobsta.Since we’ve car toured the entire island we chose to soak up the harbor some more. It was quite hot with the humidity running high. Finding a shady spot on the rocks near the waters edge we watched a cruise ship anchor and ‘bus’ folks to and from the shore, soaked our feet in the Atlantic, and of course talked about how much fun were have had.

Did anyone see Ginger?Sunshine filled the woods this morning as we lined up and headed on our way for Pine Swamp. It was good to have a crowd of us. We left two cars at our hike out point, Dickenson Gap and then two cars at the kiosk of Pine Swamp. The new lain connector trail now takes you away from where we used to just start hiking up. It only adds a few more yards. Arriving at the shelter we hear voices and a dog. Hikers have spent the night and are packing up for the morning. The stream the runs along side the trail can hardly be heard. The flow was down due to the dry summer. Climbing up to Peters Mountain was quite easy I have to say. This was my first hike since returning from those Maine Mountains. No extreme rock climbing today. I like it. Virginia is good. Switchbacks gradually wind up to the crest where the trail intersects with the start of the Alleghany Trail. Yet another path we need to complete. Jeff and Bonnie, Me and John have a seat on a log for an apple break. Ginger forages for trail crumbs left by others. Noni and Denny are just behind us. Everyone has worked up a good sweat. 2.5 miles complete. I do love walking this ridge. I sorta wish we could keep on going over to the Rice Fields to really see out but that would be a very long day for everyone. So just 3 miles up here before we turn at the big red rock. This rock marks the national forest boundary as well as our sign to look for the blue blazes of the Gap. We meet a few more hikers heading to Pine Swamp who have stayed at Rice Fields last night. The tote heavy looking packs and express the lack of water on this stretch. The leave are turning now and many already bone dry on the ground. Bright red maples color the way and yellows of the birches. Wow here we are, the red rock. Bonnie pulls her usual blistful cluelessness to landmarks. The rock directly behind her, she says where’s the red rock? I don’t see it! We all bust out laughing.Time for lunch. While eating I notice that our side trail will be quite the misleading path. Blue blazes have faded and the trail grown up. Guess I should have worn those long pants. HASlowly we start bush wacking down this 1.5 miles side trail. Now it’s not grown up to our waste but just no path to really walk on. Say is that an orange ribbon? And orange blazes? Cool, someone has been so kind to reblaze this trail and cut many of the blow downs. John helps me still look for the blue marks just to make sure we stay on the correct trail off of here. It all leads down to stony creek but it sure would be best to come off where we parked our cars. LOLA few scratches and scraps before the road is spotted. Oh and torn drawers. Yep I’ve managed to bust out of my britches again. I must have done it crossing a big tree down, rolling across it on my behind. No wonder John didn’t get up on my heels today. He must have thought I farted right big and BAM. Blow Out. We pick off the remaining burs and briars, load up and pick up our cars.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/331876,"Let’s see, just how long has it been since we had our first attempt at an overnight hike? About 6 years I believe. Packs big and tall weighing like a small child we each set out for Burke’s Garden, hiking from Rt. 42 up 10 miles to Chestnut Ridge. Tough stuff.Now a few years wiser and older we take to the top of the mountain at Rt, 623 where the trail crosses the road for a ridge walk and some chances to see the Garden as we walk. Of course I didn’t plan this trip either. Ha. My classmate from Carroll County high school drew up our itinerary. AKA The Bomb, Jimmy Baum. He hikes when he can and reads up on my adventures and decided to plan a trip. We are to hike 5.5 miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter, meet up with Noni, Denny, and Dustin who are coming in from the south, and hike off with them the next day to where they left their truck, 4.5 miles. So as you can see a much easier option. Now for the story….9:50amKeith, Chuckwagon, Niday dropped us off this beautiful Saturday morning with a hint of cool wind still in the air. I’ve never been up here and the wind not blow it’s just a matter of how hard and how cold it might be. Just us three this side of the mountain, me, The Boom and my hubbie Left Turn Leon, or ‘are we there yet Larry’. I tried to even the pack load for us by taking The Captain’s 2 man tent we took to Maine and borrowed his sleeping bag and mat for Larry. Trying to make his trip as comfortable as possible. God knows the trail just ain’t kind to the boy. You’ll hear more on that later.Our first overlook to the Garden was just grand. The grass fields still green decorated with red roofed barn and silver topped silos. By the way did you know how the Garden got its name? A man by the last name Burke settled there and started a garden by accident by throwing out his potato peels. Ta-Da a patch of potatoes and they joked by calling it Burke’s Garden. Thank you Dana, Trail Whisperer, for this tid-bit and those spuds we took up to the knob to keep the garden growing. Yes I cooked my tator over the fire and left the peel for seed. So we shall see.The stretch of trail over to Walker’s Gap is rocking in places but not a hard walk. We had a few puds but nothing strenuous until we made the climb from the Gap to the shelter. Wow now that gets your heart really pumping not to mention those legs a burning. 1000 feet elevation gain in a little over a mile.A new water source trail was being cleared by some trail workers but we didn’t venture down to inspect. The two small sources we knew about looked quite sparse so we took our chances with what we hauled in. Now here’s where some blame comes into play….I normally don’t carry more than a liter of water at a time but not knowing the water status at the gap told Larry ‘we are hauling all the water we’ll need for the trip in’. 3 Liters each on board. There is another source by a pond oh say about a mile south of the shelter. So we trek on. Jimmy is hot on my heels feeling good that he is ‘keeping up with Lead Dog’. Little does he know I’m not pushing it either but just enough for both of us to feel the burn. Larry has dropped from site. The Garden falls farther and farther below our ledge till finally we reach the ridge and the woods open up to the rock shelter. 1:00PMAh this feels good, the sun warms us, the grass cushions our seats as we unpack our gear. Stating our claim on bunking quarters, I begin setting up the tent which kept pestering me to no content. I keep adjusting trying to keep the structure taught. The gusts of wind are just enough to drive me crazy. A few more day hikers come and go. One couple had a farm down in the garden, how many times did we hear that story Jimmy? Some warned us of a Boy Scout group coming. Holy hell, hope not. Hope Denny and them get here before that. Then from the woods it’s a bird, it’s a plane, no it’s Leon. He made it, he’s finally coming in to camp and just in the nick of time. The tent is ready and his bed made. No sooner than lunch is over he is out like a light. His radio tuned to the sports network resting on his belly. Jimmy and I gather some fire wood and decide we had mine as well check out that ‘close’ water source by the pond. Larry reluctantly stirs awake to come along. 3:00PMDown hill we go over the open fields. It is a fantastic view mind you but the more we descend the farther away this close water holes seems. I begin thinking maybe we should just turn around but what the heck we’re already this far. Time passes pretty quick as the boys talk over every sport’s athlete of the decades. Look there is Noni and Denny. They have just gotten water by the spring feed pond but took them 30 minutes to get a few liters. They head for the shelter as we push on for the pond. Seeing that the spring is mud we take our chances with a full pond of frog water and who knows what else. Pulling a Bear Girls move I grab Jimmy’s bandana, he takes off his shoes and wades close to the edge. Poring the murky water thru the bandana into our bag we hope to filter the rest of the ‘whatevers’ out at camp. Larry volunteers to carry the 3 liter bag back to camp. “I’ll carry it since I have already carried ALL THE WATER WE NEED IN THIS MORNING” he says.Turns out we hiked 2 miles down and 2 miles back for this water expedition and in doing so missed the first half of the Hokie game, galded Larry’s nads and worked up a bigger thrust than when we left. Where’s the GreyGoose? 4:30PMCamp started to fill up pretty fast come sundown. Five more hikers came in for the night. Uceph and Leanna, Jonathan and his little girl Angel and another Dustin from Blacksburg. They helped get a good fire going while the cooking began in the shelter. It smelt like Red Lobster in there. Noni packed in cod fish and steaks for Denny to grill up on his stove. The beverages went down and as the food passed around. Before darkness fell Larry and I made an executive decision to bed down in the shelter. Captain’s tent was just too drafty for this wind.Once night time hit the flames filled the skies along with the stars. A clear evening. Stories and jokes danced around the camp. Where’s my tyvek? My place mat? Shit I turned my back for a quick minute and my stuff is up in smoke. Yep anything not nailed down was burned baby. A tidy camp we keep no trash gonna be left around here.

Jimmy said when he laid down for bed his stomach rumbled and sure hoped it wasn’t trouble. So far so good. What we didn’t boil was filtered and used in a camp beverage mixture to kill ‘any other impurities’.

The leaves didn’t pop with color this year, fairly dull with just a few shades of brightness. The boys crank up their discussion on sports again as we quickly walk off the 4.5 miles.

We just had our departing photo snapped all bundled up for our snowy hike. The Captain’s big truck pulled out for his drive off Mountain Lake. As the truck exhaust evaporated in the cold air we turned for the trail.“Which way are we hiking the AT today, north or south AT?” South to Stony Creek. I look for our first white blaze leading us into the woods, which you will see become harder and harder to find. The snow is much deeper than expected. 6 to 12 inches. Fluffy thick and slick slick slick. We put on more layers and gloves. I couldn’t even see any of Larry’s face but his eyes. Bonnie don’t you fall now we’ll lose you in the drifts, she’s only 4 foot nothing ya know! LOLI myself am having a tough time directing us. First off these damn new glasses are driving me crazy. Too dark. I feel like Stevie Wonder out here. The lenses kept dark from snow reflection. It’s hard enough finding the path with white blazes covered over with snow but doing it in the dark is even harder. The trail disappears…..Panning out like rescue workers on a mission looking for a dead body we comb for white marks. Heck we haven’t walked more than ½ mile and we can’t find the trail. How you reckon this day’s gonna go? NOT TOO GOOD, as Larry the Cable Guy might say. Harry is our saving grace more than once. He finds the path and leads this blind dog all day long. We would walk ½ mile at a time hiking along just fine and then bam no trail. No blaze no clear path. I checked the map a few times to determine our location to an old mountain road. As a last resort we could walk it but sure would add more miles to the day…like 4 and I’m not real sure it’s out point. We keep panning for that path.“Hey my water is frozen!” Bonnie reports. How about a rock hard trail bar to gnaw on? Sure why not what’s a few broken teeth. I can eat snow if I have to for liquid. No wait, they say not to do that. Wonder what Survivor Man would do?Harry’s mustache is crystallized ice from his breath and sweat. Oh yes we worked up a sweat just walking along the ridge for the couple of miles. A couple of miles turned extra from stumbling around like we were lost….well we were sorta…Shoot this hike was supposed to be an easy 5 miles, right Larry? Hey he planned this one folks not Lead Dog. All in all it was fun. We laughed mostly at ourselves and enjoyed the winter wonder land. Snow gathered on every limb like cotton. Some downed trees had almost a foot of the white stuff piled high just waiting on the wind to brush it away. A lot of rocks today, all hid under the snow for us to trip over. No one was hurt just a few bumps, a few pulled muscles from slipping down and one bent hiking pole. Yep, this big girl’s 170 pounds rolled right down on my stick that was caught between two rocks and curled its end nicely. Rats! “Say Martha lets us your lunch mat and ride right on off this mountain” We reached the turn off to Bailey’s Gap and boy were we ready for some ‘good’ trail. Tracks were made quick down to Stony Creek Road. I felt like I was along running. I still don’t know how Harry managed with his make shift hiking poles off here. He forgot his trekking poles so keep picking up sticks to help himself along. Hey Martha, my stick is bent too!! Yea really funny Harry, just throw that one down and grab another.

It was either watching the guys slip and slide or seeing the Cascades crystallized over or the after the trail talk. I’ll let you tell me….Every time I’ve been to the Cascades this time of year the trail is one slick track and today was no exception. With the many hikers previous the path was totally packed like a bobsled ramp. Even the places with rock steps where frozen solid with the snow packed to the rim of each. Only toe holds to maneuver carefully from one step to another.Bonnie and I strapped on our yak traks with Larry dismissing the need for them and then Jeff graciously lent his hiking poles to Johnny Knobknocker. Are you kidding me Jeff? No way, he’d been on his own if it had been me. Of course Jeff was in Dallas all day so who knows where his mind was. LOL You’d have to been along to get that line.We have the trail to ourselves leaving the parking lot at 9ish. An overcast day with a hint of dampness in the air, a few snow specks hit my face. I thought about hiking faster so we might get to the cascades and then go on up to Barney’s Wall but Larry had caught my thoughts out loud on the way over and axed that in hurry. See I can be compromising. I conceded to the call of marriage. Harry was quite happy to hear of this and said “this marriage was working out just fine for him!”Bon Bon and I quickly pull away from the fellas as they scratch to stay upright and of course are telling some crazy stories we girls would want to hear. By the way “OBX” doesn’t mean Outer Banks on the trail. Again you’d have to be here.The rocks of the stream are snow covered and ice branches the gaps between then to form interesting sculptures. I love this time of year. Soon we reach the Cascades. Usually it roars with the pressure of water gushing from above but today it is quiet. Frozen from the outer edges in, only a few feet wide steam of water ran over the ledge. Ice formed in piles at its base and the surrounding waters frozen like a skating rink. Daring Harry scampers out to the ice ledges and before I know it is right under the falls, or where they normal would crash down. Holy hell, get back here! Like kids in a super market running for shopping carts to ride here goes the rest of them boys out to play too. First Jeff then Larry but John holds back just in case he is called about for search and rescue. Smart man. We gather for a photo on the lone rock and then retreat for easier walking down the forest road. Well easier for some. Hey Larry how’s that sore leg? Did you pull a muscle doing that split/slide. Niiiice form. I think he said his doctor would chalk it up to spouse abuse. A few people start to trickle into the woods by now, almost 11:00. The parking lot has more cars too. We find a small spot to huddle around for a quick chat before our lunch at the New River Grill. Yep we are going back and should beat the church crowd. Trail talk and old stories fill the air along with possibly a new trail name or two. One in particular, Heffy. Not to be mistaken for HEFTY. But HEFFY. As in Hue Hefner.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/335805,"I have seen many a hiker change their name along their journey or have it changed for them. My dear husband seems to be just one of those people. I hesitate calling him a hiker as he refuses to be lumped in that group in my conversation, but his name just keeps on changing. It’s now 3 weekends in a row he has wondered the woods with me and that’s a record for Hiker Left Turn Leon, aka 220, Heffey, now The Sweeper. Our group unloaded at the foot of Dragon’s Tooth for our ascent and was joined by two new hikers today. First, a newbie to the AT, Herb. He is a friend of Johnny Knobknocker and hiked Kilimanjaro with him. Secondly, a veteran to the trail, Signage, who has been there and done that, 2007. I soaked up her every word as she told us stories of her trip. A crisp morning, 20 degrees or so but not bitter. No wind, great. 7 of us today. Wow Captain’s truck is gonna be full when we come down on Trout Creek side. He is our shuttle out today. We are running a tad behind schedule but that’s ok we can make up time on the way down I say to myself. Falling into pecking order the girls sorta gather in the front and boys tend to heard to the back with Larry bringing up the rear, The Sweeper. Signage told us of her wilderness group she helps with and her spot on their hikes is The Sweeper, the person making sure that all others are moving it along ok and not left behind. Humm, that sorta covers Larry’s spot except who’s gonna make sure he’s moving along ok?? Jeff tried. They swept and swept all day. Some times so good we lost them all together. HAThe sweat drips from several brows as we reach our first overlook of the valley. Wow who would have thought you could sweat in cold weather but you start to slay the Dragon and you’ll find out. Jeff’s wool hat was soaked through and when he took it off for a ball cap it froze. Herb’s face is red as a fire hydrant. Where’s Larry?Jeff informs us someone other than himself will have to administer mouth to mouth as he is not the man for the job. Larry appears from the rocks staggering to gain his composure. “I like this Sweeping Job” he gasps for air. We press on for the tooth. More rocks to scramble over. Sure glad no ice to contend with. Only a spot or so but none to speak of really. We spy McAfee’s knob, Tinker Cliff and The Peaks of Otter in the distance. The skies are partially clear with some blue from time to time, Nice!!Once we reached the junction of Dragon’s tooth and the AT we take a break. 1st lunch as it was explained to us by Signage. She is correct. Just the little I have walked the trail you do have a small lunch about 11 and then really chow at 1:00 or so. The air cut thru us not long after stopping. The sweat dries and you get cold quick so our stop was short and sweet with a photograph or two and we say our good byes. Signage is hiking back to her car and we are heading south to meet The Captain. Sure hope she can join us again AND again.Cooler going down I pick up the pace. Footing is pretty good except for some leaf covered sections. Still some snow on this side, but easily past over. Bon Bon and I lose the rest of our troops. The boys have called a huddle and stop to talk aka take a rest. Soon Herb catches us and becomes one of the girls. Gives us time to talk trail and also make bets on which one the lagging fellows will lead them down the wrong path. See there are about two hairpin turns that can be misleading if you aren’t watching. And we already know John’s history of not watching don’t we. Sure enough they missed the turns but not by much and each seemed to point the finger at the other or say “I knew which way to go”. Down Down and a few switch backs and the sound of a diesel truck is heard. I inform my bunch that’s Captain’s rig and we aint far now. Trout creek has frozen spots. A cold place this is. We made it about 15 minutes later than scheduled so not bad. As I step on the bridge I hear this rock slide behind me. It’s Herb, down on his butt, stick bent in a 90 degree angle. Damn that’s 2 weeks in a row a stick has met its waterloo. Sipping on a cold beverage, thank you Captain and Shirley, we 3 first finishers watch from the road as the rest come hiking in. John gives that little smile of accomplishment while the other two have a different way of showing it…Jeff hobbles with a limp and Larry strides as if he has a corn cob you know where. Holy cow boys ya’ll alright?Laughter fills the holler and hikers fill the big truck. Off to Ironto’s Italian Kitchen. Can we get there any faster?","Rt. 624

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336191,"It seems the last few hikes have been a dash for the trail followed by a feeding frenzy. No way we’re gonna get in shape like this. But boy is it fun tryin!BonBon and I rolled into McAfee’s parking lot to see a surprise visitor, John, and he brought his daughter Emily. Way cool. Signage was there as planned and we made a quick run for the trail. Literally, you have to listen for cars before running for the other side of the road where the trail picks up. What a great day for a hike. Warmer weather with a tad overcast, no wind. Perfect. I even sported my trail runners today instead of boots. Signage has been fighting a foot problem of her own and is wearing a second new pair of shoes in two weeks. These New Balance Boot/shoe seems to agree with her so far. We have the trail to ourselves which I just love. Along with trail stories from Signage I hardly remember most of the climb. We talked of future hikes and family. John was our lone man for the day. Herding the Hens as I called it. Lucky for him we behaved ourselves, the best we could anyways. The woods were now clear of snow. The only colorful spot was the moss growing on the roof and around Catawba Shelter. It glowed green thru the dull branches. Not far past the shelter we hit the long switchback grade to the top. Some mud and then packed frozen snow. Slippery as snot really. Just look for a rock peeping out to put your foot on for a hold. This went on for about ½ mile maybe more. We see the knob sign.A grand view as I had hoped. Still ice on the rock outcrop, watch your step, not so close to the each Signage. She’s a regular dare devil. No fear in this chick. The rest of us set with safe distance from the 50+ foot drop and have a snack. No lunch stop today we have The Homeplace to attend later. Quote of the day: “Never follow a Thru-Hiker for they know what they do” Let me explain. A thru hiker has accomplished many a great feat on their trip, hiked high mountains and climbed numerous rock ledges. Some scarier than others. This day we have the icy ledge which leads from the Knob to another outcropping. On a ‘good’ day this can be scary. A path about two feet wide boarded by scrubs on your right = SAFE, then on your left = NADA, SPACE, THIN AIR…You catch my drift? So what do we do… we follow Signage…easy Bonnie take your time. I leave room for a falter either on my part or another one of us. I scoot my feet and my toes try to grab thru my shoes for a grip. John said it all..I ain’t all about this!!! Wew we make it. Now this isn’t but a few yards but sure seemed longer. Signage smiles and laughs at making an adventure out of the Knob. A few hikers are arriving now and take photos, time for us to split. We decide to cut on to the fire road just a mile down from the top, we can make quick time on it. The track is pretty muddy but a nice walk and with a pleasant view. More and more folks on this path too. Say is that gal barefooted? I had to ask why. Chelsea Lynn was her name and barefootin was her game. Headed for the top with no water or clothes except for what was on her. “A massage for the feet” she said the trail was. Holy cow tough stuff. Happy Hiking and off she went. Arriving back at the road we have one more dash to our cars. It is like the game of wack-a-mole. Don’t get smacked by a car and run for your life. We say our good byes to John and Emily as they will miss the grubbin down the way. A good hike it was. Let’s eat.I now know why the hikers plan there trip around this place, The Home Place. Down home country cookin, all you can eat. A hikers dream. The chicken was finger lickin good, and pass them pintos I’m out. This Carroll County girl will be headin back thar real soon. Happy Birthday Captain and Bonnie hope your day was as good for you as it was fur me!!!!","Parking Lot
",McAfee Knob,"Jan 30, Sun",7
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336545,"Happy Birthday to me and it was in more ways than one. Some I shall not go into and just leave for your imagination the rest I shall share. Harry and I rolled into the open field, aka parking lot. It’s Sunday so we shall not leave our cars at the big white church. For years we’ve been coming here and parking at one of the two places. Once an old house was here but burned down some few years ago. We’ve had a note left on our cars to not park here in the past but we take our chances just the same and lead other hikers to follow our lead. 4 more cars arrive.We decided to scratch the Sarver hike and go left to Kelly’s knob instead. The views will be better and it’s a perfect day to see the valley. Wispy clouds stretched across the skies. A cool morning but not cold enough for wool hats. I wonder if there will be any snow left along the way. Most all has melted now. Meandering thru the open fields before cutting back into the cover of woods we don’t see the donkey’s they must be in the barn. No birds either, too early yet. The sun warms us quickly and we shed that top jacket and take in the breeze. Ahh it feels good. Soon we arrive at the Blair Witch House. I always have to take a look around the place. We speculate a wild and crazy time was had when the black hand prints made tracks over the clap boards. Prints on the ceiling, prints on the walls, print on the front door. Hey check this out, a water source has developed just below the old home place. I’ve never noticed before but during the winter guessing snow run off is enough to create a small pool of water and slight spring. Good to know.Up and over a hill and the sounds of Laurel Creek begin to be heard. It’s moving pretty good but I have seen it higher. We rock hop keeping our feet dry. The laurel thicket has kept some of the snow from melting and a slick layer of ice lead from the water’s edge.Stopping at the shelter we check out the latest entries in the register and guess who is featured? The Captain’s zipline. The entry reads to not only stop at Wood’s Hole but don’t pass up the zip across Stony Creek at The Captain’s. A great stop for sure. They love ya man!!!Time to climb the knob now and feel the burn. A steep ascent this is. I feel my legs getting heavier and heavier. Harry says if I need a break he is all for it! I can’t, gotta get to the top. Sweet relief and what a trade off, Views, Views. Again Happy Birthday to me. The rocks spaced just far enough to keep me from daring the jump across. I set up on a nice little place in the sun to eat my lunch. Harry skips from rock to rock playing hop scotch. No fear in this man either. I ventured across one time and was scared half to death coming back so none for me. Some Hokie students arrive and take in the grandeur too. Some of them haven’t been here before and want to know more. Camera’s snap left and right. Glad we got here early as another couple is coming along behind us. We don’t hang out too long there are super bowl parties to attend this afternoon. Wow in no time we are back to the shelter and the creek. One last hill to climb out and we’ll be back to our parking field. Wonder if we’ll have that note Harry? Well we didn’t get a note we got the writer instead. Yep Granny Nascar came wheelin up in her big truck and asked “if we had permission from the owner to park here?” Well…a…no. Are you the owner? I thought we were gonna get a Hell Yea but she soon simmered down when smooth talking Handsome Harry talked her off her high horse by mentioning the house fire and was anyone hurt. He had just blasted me for not having any useless information in the absence of the Captain. Well the house fire was all I had and good thing cause it sure helped us out of this tight spot. Before long Granny Nascar was cooled off and telling us life stories of the property and land trusts with the ATC. All in all good ole gal just protecting what’s hers. We passed along her parking advice to the other hikers coming into the field and shared other hiking trails with them. It was good to see so many young folks enjoying nature with us. I had a great birthday hike, thanks for joining me Harry.","Parking Field, Rt. 42
",Kelly's Knob,"Feb 06, Sun",7
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/337717,"We headed back to Kellys Knob for another rock hop scotch scramble. Harry informed me hadn’t come up from John’s Creek side so that was all the incentive I needed. AND well it’s all up from the time car door shuts. Boy it was a sight better feeling today (temperature wise) than my last time I hiked this direction. I think it was like 5 degrees and snow on the ground one February. My hands were freezing before I could get my gaiters on. Today however was short sleeves and cotton socks. Yep Harry Cottontail was our gear master. It being a balmy day and just a chance of rain late, he gambled on his cotton getting him thru. Doesn’t he know Cotton Kills Man!!!Jimmy ‘The Bomb’ made it from Raliegh by way of Carroll County. He’s an old school buddy of mine and was in town sort of and came to hike. Along with Signage we had a good group to make conversation quite interesting. She hadn’t hiked this section since her trip in 2007 and hadn’t taken the option to view Kellys knob then either and Jimmy hadn’t done from the creek to Rocky Gap. I love completing a section even if it isn’t my own.Arriving at the trailhead we noticed this guy cramming stuff in this hatch, dog, gear you name it. Many cars too. Not more than a hundred yards in the woods we see where the party was last night. A fellow sets by a smoldering fire strumming his guitar, two more tents zipped tight, beverage cans scattered all about. Clothes hanging from various trees like someone twirled around and flung them for show. Happy Trails Dude…Eager to see how my foot fairs today I take my post in the lead. The trail is a gradual climb thru low tree growth and rocky patches. Once we hit Rocky Gap road the long wide fire road faces us. Grab granny low here cause the burn is about to set in those legs. Up we go. Glad it is overcast or the sweat really would have been flowing. Soon we reach the junction of John’s Creek Trail, a 4 mile side trail. Then a couple who stayed at the knob appears before us. They say it wasn’t too bad last night, windy of course but had a nice stay. They still had on heavy coats and long pants so they had not warmed up yet. Signage confirms that thru hiking does prevent most of the side trail adventures. Like this short yardage walk from the AT to Kelly’s Knob. She never even remembered seeing the sign. Well if your 5 foot little you wouldn’t think to look up at Jolly Green Giant eye level for a sign that’s for sure. This sign is quite out of place.We have the rocks all to ourselves. Harry hops about like it’s nothing. While Jimmy takes a more tactful approach. Signage thinks about it and thinks some more and sets down beside me. I know I’m not going over. Where’s the Captain to give us coordinates of local land marks? How will we know where we are looking? I give my best locations but I’m sure I screwed something up. After lunch we head towards 42. No need to worry about parking spot today. We didn’t dare park in Nascar Ladies Lot. Took her advice and parked at a stop sign junction where there was a car two already this morning. The foot does good. I can still feel it ‘talking to me’ but it ain’t shoutin. I hike on. Down Down from the knob. We are warm even going down hill, love it. Spring is just around the corner and so was the shelter. We take a look. Signage has a mission of taking pictures of all shelters and privies. Jim finds a hammock strap someone has left in haste. Bummer for them.Speaking of finding stuff, the Blair Witch House had it all. From Natty Lights to Miller Highlife 40s to Four Loko. Watch out for the Blackout in a can. They say to combo of alcohol and caffeine will rock your world. Well we didn’t rock we just trash collected. Between Jim and Harry their packs were packed out. Looking them from behind you’d thought they were alchies looking for a place to lite. Apparently others have found the witch house ok to camp by but we all gave a thumbs down on that idea. Soon the woods opens to our field walk and sight of the donkeys. Signage remembered them from ’07 walk. One bellows at us and paces his fence line as we walk by like he is guarding his fields. Well maybe he is, he belongs to Nascar Lady. Hey look, she’s stacked off our ‘old parking grounds’ and put up No Parking signs. Guess she really means business now. We gather around our cars watching traffic pass by talking about which road leads where in this valley and places we need to hike next. Those AT sections call us back even for those who have hiked them all and those of us looking to.","Johns Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/338151,"Have you ever experienced what seemed like a little piece of heaven? Felt the warmth of home in another place? See the light in someone’s eye like you could see their soul? Oh and feel the love between two people so strong it bleeds over to your heart? Well you just stop in Woods Hole and let heaven take you. Harry and I were shuttled from Angels Rest parking spot back to Sugar Run by Neville the owner of Woods Hole. She and her husband Michael gave us a tour of their place before dropping us off on our hike.Pulling into the drive I noticed the raised garden beds where finished from last year. Fenced off and ready for this year’s plants. The old bunkhouse has been a temporary workshop for Michael to keep out of the cold while working on other projects. Idol hands make devils work I think is how that saying goes and there ain’t no chance of that around here. The block fire pit and oven are finished too. Walking into the house we are asked to remove our shoes which feel right at home. Sock feet on a warm hard wood floor and the coziness of Miss Tilly’s spirit fills me. Her old treasures have been kept safe and here for us to enjoy. Glass jars filled with garden goodies stack a wall before entering the kitchen. The aroma of dried herbs rushes my nose. They have remodeled the kitchen but still leave it with that 1800s look.Then we see the front room, the actual clay and log home that Tilly lived in. Tall sealing with rafters and tin roof to boot. Can you hear the rain already? Upstairs two rooms are for guests, one more private for a special rate or you can buddy with friends. All of which have those Tilly relics. One I noticed right off, an old foot powered sewing machine just like my granny used to work. In the loft of that room Michael had the start of his greenhouse seeds. Yep up in a warm sunny spot of the dormer he placed trays of seeds that have gotten a good start. They plan to set come April. Back downstairs we step into the massage parlor. A sauna cabinet readies you for some soothing oils to relieve those aches and troubles. Should we ditch the hike and just stay here? We must get our day started Harry time to hit the fog and rain. We say our good-byes and we’re off for Doc’s Knob. Shuffling thru the short bushes the branches make us more wet than the actual showers. Harry, Cotton IS King, has once again pulled some trail gear wonders. Tennie shoes today, wool socks-Good call, cotton shorts and tee-shirt. Damn man didn’t you hear it’s supposed to rain all day and it’s always colder in Giles. He did have sense enough to call me for the use of my gaiters. He also has rain jacket and pants but has elected to run free today and test his rain proof skin. I laugh to myself. Not more than 2 miles and we reach our first overlook, Doc’s knob. Fog socked there is no view just a white abyss. The rhodies add some color for us and once we turn off the mountain for the fire road they engulf us. Had it been a down pour we’d been in good cover. Stories of previous hikes, camping snafus, and those young and wild days of not giving a care bring us to laugh out loud. Just before reaching our double blaze to turn back on top of Pearis Mountain we meet a thru hiker. Ewok, a short guy with a bright white smile and dark eyes. He’s from Asheville and southbound last year and had to come off in Pearisburg with a bad knee. I think in December is when he came off. Now he is back finishing sections he missed and headed for Hot Springs now. We told him of the rain coming and Woods Hole was the ticket to take. Hopefully he did. After a quick snack at the double blaze and some gear jockeying we head for the ridge. What has Harry got on now? One minute he has his rain jacket over his backpack and his hood up to hold it on. Looks like a little kid running thru the yard playing superman. Then he’s added the gaiters over his rain pants to protect up his tennie shoes from getting soaked. NIICE.Almost at the crest the winds howl. Do you hear that train? Or is it the ocean waves breaking? What a sound. Do we dare? The open power line clearings give us our only views out. Narrows, Sentinal Point, The New River. Gusts of fog roll over us. Hurry lets get back into the woods. Soon we reach Wilburn Valley over look and then Angels Rest. We don’t even bother to go out on the rocks. No need no view. Hey but at least it hasn’t poured rain all day. We’ve been quite lucky. Now just the 1.7 miles of down to conquer and we’re out. My feet tell me we’ve been walking since 9:30, almost 1:30 now. We should be finished by 2 and then we’ll be off for a buffalo burger. Easy don’t fall now. The mud is quite slippery on this slope. I’m warm hiking down. Warmer off that ridge. Soon we come to the road. A great day for a hike and so glad we got to experience that little piece of heaven. Now time for the New River Grill. Harry changes again, imagine that. LOL I’ll have to tell you what happened at the grill. Two cases of mysterious phenomena. #1 Watch out for that dip in the floor. Seems that the weak legged walks hit shortly after the trail. #2 Beer Bandits. Never leave your beer in the company of a blind weak legged friend trying to get closer to the tv so he can see the scores while you go the restroom. Gone what do you mean it’s gone. Did you drink it? Harry!!??","Woods Hole

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/338741,"Excited to walk new ground today I’m up before day break. No wait I had to get up before light heck the time changed on me. Wew gotta get used to this. Tired from missing an hour of sleep, shucks! That’s not tired. Tired is hiking 12 ½ miles. I get a surprise call from Johnny Knobnocker and he’s meeting us this morning. I blew pass the first park-n-ride knowing I was traveling by myself to meet Signage at 311. Well John has decided to come AND another gal, Darrie, meeting us at the trailhead.Darrie is sporting a loaner pack in preparation of a backpacking trip in April. Not sure how much she was carrying but not geared out. The rest of us put on the day packs and are ready the adventure. I’ve hiked Andy Lane many times, even when it was the ‘old’ route. No doubt about it there’s a section worth comparing to Maine without the rocks. Steep steep back to back climbs but first let’s enjoy the stroll down to Tinker Creek and feel the morning sun brighten our path. The waters roll about the fullest I’ve seen here. You could kayak or tube for sure. A big coleman tent is set up from a night’s stay along creek. Soon we begin that climb, the cement plant humming to our left as we make our way to Scorched Earth Gap. It’s always nice to round that last bend and see the big rock signify the junction of the AT. 3 miles down and my legs are all warmed up for that last push up to Tinker Cliffs. The plan is to take the Tinker Loop trail today, a blue blazed trail which is part AT and then all side trail around the back side of the mountain. New ground, I love it. A blue bird day with quite the wind gusts at times. Gonna be blustery on top no doubt. We take a break on the rock, put on a layer, and read 5.9 mile Tinker loop. Donna is quick to say she’s only walked this once and was following. She’s asked a friend to double check the route just to make sure. Side trails can be tricky, some marked well some not. Good ole Andy Lane did a fine job on his trail and it has been maintained since his passing. There was even a board down at the start with clippers hanging on hooks for volunteers to take in with them. Stone walls tower over us as we follow the trail to the cliffs. Here comes that wind now. Gusts try to take my hat off. My eyes water. McAfee Knob, see it John? The cliff’s edge offer vast views over Catawba Valley, farm lands sectioned off, not quite green yet. We point out the AT ridge walk over to the Knob and then North Mountains path which used to be where the AT ran years ago. Wow sure glad they moved it over here. This IS the triple crown ya know. Dragon’s tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs all in a 20 mile stretch. Donna and I talk about this and to add North Mountain for an exciting loop overnight. Yeeaaa Baby!!!Darrie has to leave us now. She’s not up for the whole hike today. We try to set down for a bite to eat but the gusts are just too much. Cooler up here too. Run for cover. She returns to her car and we hike on along the edge and enjoy the views. Look a faint blue mark. I remembered these from past hikes but never knew where they lead. White blazes have been redone after we leave the cliffs. Good thing folks are aways going the wrong way here, myself included. Sometimes I see this big rock over hang and sometime totally miss it. Not today we scramble around the turns of the trail and see all the rock structures, way cool. We meet two backpackers heading north. Big smiles even after hiking up the steep grade we are descending. Down, down, my feet crunch in the toe of the shoes. Leaves are thick too, hiding the trail. Carvens Cove is spotted to our left. We end up seeing it most of the day. Junction time. Here we go, new ground. Ya’ll remember that big grass gap we’ve stopped at for lunch a few times hiking Tinkers? Well this is where the blue blazes come in. Turn left on a farm road. There’s a big barn too. Nice barn with two picnic tables. Oh I’ll come back here a camp. Water runs down the trail from all the rain we’ve had. The blazes are some what faint and far between. A man sets on a rock. Wow what a pack. It was like a bear hanging around him. Two feet above his head and twice as wide as him. Older fellow plum worn out. He said he’d taken the side trail to avoid the cliffs. After talking about it we decided he added miles instead of shortened. He didn’t ask for food but mentioned being low. I’d offered some of mine but hey man we’re on an adventure hike and we might need all we have if we get lost. After we left him John fesses up he is totin’ a 12inch sub. Now you’re talking. Donna you trip him and I’ll knock him on the head and we’ll split it if hard times come on us. Fairly easy walking, this trail goes down a ways but cuts back toward the cliffs running thru under growth but no bush whacking. I keep my eyes peeled for blazes when the four wheeler track disappears. An up and down or two and we stop at a tiny stream made from rain run off. Good cold mountain water. Yumm. My foot aches, throbs actually. My hearts in my heel. Motrin please. How peaceful here. Sunshine. Leaves dance around with each wind gust but they are short lived. Donna has treated us with homemade oatmeal cookies. Can’t beat that.Not sure exactly how far we are we pack up and move out. Shoot we were just one corner from the picnic table and footbridge at the AT connection. Next time we’ll know. It’s about 1:30. We’ve done great. Camping here is prime. Flat for many tents and the stream right here for easy access. Trail maintainers have re-routed the old steep climb from the creek and Lamberts Shelter to Scorched Earth so this mile is steady good. The last time I was here Noni had a heart attack and Larry passed out in the weeds. So that tells the story.Well we made the loop adventure and plan to hike it again. Now just those 3 miles down Andy Lane. We chat of other trails to hike and states to conquer. I feel the urgency sometimes to hurry and finish, the whole AT that is. What if I have heart trouble and my knee gives out, Captain in mind here. I got-to go and hike NOW..Donna settles me down. The miles will be there I just need to take it one weekend at a time and enjoy what I have. Just like this loop. I’ve been here at least a dozen times and now it’s all new.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/342090,"If I have to pick a trail to hike knowing I just might be walking alone it would be the Rice Fields. It’s close enough for a quick drive and long enough to satisfy my hunger for trail time. However I didn’t have to walk alone I had some old friends join me along with a newbie to the trail. Anxious to get my day rolling I arrived at Renee’s early. With our big storm running thru Pulaski friday night phone contact had been sporadic and I didn’t know for sure if she was going. You know how I get, patting my foot impatiently awaiting 8am, I’m at her place 20 minutes early. I surprise her with the news that Bonnie and her stepdaughter Lindsey are meeting us. I just love when someone new comes. I can bend their ear with all my stories of times hiked on that particular section. The fog has been left from the storms and we wonder if our views will be any. 10 miles today Lindsey, you ready? Tennie shoes and Bonnie’s ‘gaudy’ wool socks on she smiles grabs her loaner sticks and says yes. The little creek along the trail is quite full. Rock hoping the 4 crossing and coming on to our first climb I announce let the UP begin. Bon and Renee know what’s in store but our newbie, well she just puts her head down and plows right behind me. At the big rock where I always stop to shed layers Renee calls out that this ain’t the pace she’s used to and Bonnie chimes in that’s why she’s in the back. LOL. While stripping quickly down to short sleeves Lindsey asks if this is how the rest of the day will be. I give a little wink with a smirk, OH YEAH! The trail is somewhat washed in places from the hard rains but with all the rock it’s just like always, step after step, running along the side of the mountain up. We can hear Celanese plant grown below us letting off steam. Blue sky tries to peek periodically between fog banks. We chatter like hens, clucking out tails of men and woe. Gossip and advice, all those things women know all about. You should come listen sometime. There Lindsey, see the ridge, that’s sweet relief. You’ve made it up the worst part. One foot in VA, one foot in WVA, how cool is that? Her eyes light up. Ridge walking is fine. Meandering along the crest of Peter’s Mountain we have breaks of fog to see the valley below. Green pastures, a house or two. Soon the woods part to the large grassy opening of the Rice Fields. Hindered still by the white blanket we keep hoping for a glimpse below. We leave our packs for a quick walk to check out the shelter. A hiker appears, Big Country, from Alabama. He’s hiking for a second time to try and complete farther than he got last year. Wet and looking quite thin he held up in the shelter to dry out. Tarp tenting last night in the storm didn’t prove a sound shelter. I tell him of the Captain’s and he takes direction planning to head that way.Over lunch the privy turned into an interesting conversation since Lindsey hadn’t visited one before. Quite airy on that platform huh? She also ate her lunch as if she’d been out for a week. Wow, this tastes sooo good!!! We get a good laugh, especially Renee and I since we sure know that feeling of living off trail food for more than a few days. Nothing like looking forward to a cheeseburger or a mound of spaghetti. BREAD!!!Time to hike off now. It’s all down hill from here, well almost. I told her how I have the magic of making a hike up hill both ways. She was impressed.Cool temps coming in, hope we bet the rain. Once off the ridge the knees begin to feel the stress of the mountain. Toes cram to the front of our shoes. Burn those calories girls. Lindsey can’t believe we walked up all this. We meet another thru hiker from Bluefield WV. He’s headed for Pine Swamp shelter. I tell him of Captain’s too but he doesn’t seem interested as he has his mind set on milages and specific stops. Sound like someone else you know? Then near our finish we meet another fellow. Young buck, big boy, carrying 60 pounds. He’s from Miami and just started on the trail today. He had gear packed for 11 days he says, heading for Daleville. We wish him well and come to our end. Kicking off our shoes for sandals the oohhs and aaahhs let out. What a great feeling to share with friends, indeed.","Rt. 624

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/344013,"I have said in the past you just never know when you’ll acquire your trail name. It can come without warning and it can come often. Oh and it can come over and over, stabbing you in the back like a knife or like getting run over by a bus. Heck mine came without me even being on the trail. Wait, that’s a problem.Harry and I met at Trent’s Store Saturday morning as the fog and rain moved out from our region leaving us an unseasonable warm sunny day. Slim Jim just arrives as well from his night out in the woods. Yes he braved those forecasted rains Friday and hiked the loop we intend to hike today AND he spent the night in his hammock ALL ALONE. Now that’s a REAL hiker. He is quick to smack me around for bailing on him and says he has left a little something for me at Wapiti Shelter. Saying our good bye to Jim, Harry gets his trail food of two Cokes, nabs and Amish cheese and salutes Jim’s fortitude. Arriving at where we would have camped we make the decision to hike up the Ribble first connecting to the AT at the top of the mountain and loop around for the 13 miles.   This will get the hardest climb out of the way first thing and only tease Harry with an easy stroll for the first two miles walking the AT. Fresh spring flowers are popping out now, May Apple, violets, blood root. Most of the trees are budding too with tiny leaves starting to form. This little 2 mile section of the AT prior to the Ribble junction is quite nice. Tall thick pines form a wooded darkened canopy with the white blazes shining bright like flashlights up ahead. What Is that up ahead? People, camouflage, hunters. Two guys are walking up the ribble too. We follow hoping they will turn off either in the woods or just off the trail where a parking place is. Arriving at the forest gate/parking area they do leave. Get ready for the up Harry. “This is where Johnny Knobknocker hit the wall and dropped all this Sand that day”! With a groan and moan he mutters “And it’s only going to be 80 degrees TODAY, I could have walked this YESTERDAY when natures air condition was on” Are you guys feeling that knife go in my back about now?Meandering up the forest road the trail runs in and out of laurels, over small streams and then open woods. Look more people Harry! Three young kids and a dog are up in front of us as we get closer to the top. They stop short and wait on us and boy are we glad they did. What a treat meeting these cousins, Laura and her dog, Gypsy from NC and Luke and his brother Eric from Charlotte. She has graduated Wake Forest and plans to work at a dude ranch with her father this summer in Montana. They just happened on the job and decided to take it. The boys are finishing high school and excited about hiking more of the AT. How impressive that they just picked this spot to hike and so young and so free. We gather at the old run down hunter’s cabin for a picture or two. I tell them of the overlook they will come past and what to expect for camp and their hike out Sunday. They are covering about 7 miles at a time and will have a short hike out to finish. Once on the AT the air turns cooler and the sweat dries to salt on my face. Cloud cover keeps the sun from truly baking us, still no leaves out just yet up here. Harry pulls his hat out just for safe measure. We chat about tv shows and foraging for trail treats like merkels aka morels. Those honeycomb like mushrooms that are oh so good fried. More people approach, just a small family out for a stroll from the tower to the overlook I guess.Ah yes the overlook, lunch time, shoes and socks off rest. There’s Docs Knob and Angels Rest and the valley to Woods Hole. The cousins catch us and have their second lunch. PBJ samiches and trail bars. The rocks feel cool on my feet, lovely. The kids only have 3 more miles to their day, stopping at Wapiti and we have about 5 so we clear on out and say our last good-byes to them.Not more than 200 hundred yards do we run into yet more people. These are thru-hikers from our great state of VA and they are drying out from yesterday and look to be settled in to their camp for the night possibly. We tell them of Woods Hole but they seem determined for town.A little more ridge walking and we turn for the valley and Wapiti. We have to stop there ya know, there’s that ‘something’ left there by Slim Jim. Small rocks impede the trail but all in all this down isn’t too bad. A few rhododendron tunnels to pass under and we are there. Conversation quickly turns to Randall Lee Smith, who is no longer in this world, who killed two campers at this location and later after being released from prison came back into these woods to attempt killing two fisherman. Holy Wacky Wapiti Batman!Harry opens the hiker log for the shelter and there it is, My Surprise!! You can read the exact words here in a picture associated with this journal but in short…Lead Dog is now “Fair Weather Girl” who has left her hiking friend to himself. Bailed on him! Kicked to the curb, Sucker punched, Ran from the Rain. All day I heard about it from Harry and now it is written for all to see. I have been shamed. With a big laugh or twelve The Straggler pushes that knife a little deeper and we press on for our car. Only 3½ miles to go. The pond just out from the shelter was fenced off with orange snow fencing. We suspect to keep the horses out. There are many connecting horse trails along here. The AT runs along the bottom lands with the stream and thru a few marsh spots. More hikers spotted, All from Richmond, one thru-ing and the other two out with their buddy for the weekend. I’m sure Captain will start seeing more hikers now. Speaking of Captain he came up while the day wore on and we realized our tree knowledge was dwindling. We had regressed to guessing at types of trees and challenging one another as to what type of pine this and that was. This just won’t do Harry expressed. There’s the ribble junction again Harry, we’ve made our loop, now just that last easy stroll back to our car. Boy I’m ready for a good foot soakin in that creek too. The day had warmed quite a bit and my feet where feelin it. What’s that up ahead? Two horses were tied and feeding on a hanging bale of hay. A horse trailer pulled in for the night and owners out on the trail some place. We both took just enough time to drop our packs at the car and grab a cold beverage before darting for the creek. Setting on the bank, feet numbed by the water, we laugh at how our weekend came to an end. Some here, some there, but all getting our trail fix. Oh and you know the best part? Pulling my feet out of the water and slipping on my shoes, feels just like warm butter baby!!!!","Dismal Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345008,"Some hikers say luck will get them through, some say determination and some say the good Lord. All I know is you gotta wanna make it happen and this week well that’s what happened. A thunder storm loamed over heard. Lightening flashed a few times too. We pass thru Big Walker Mountain Tunnel, same thing on this side. Sure hope it rolls on past Bonnie. We hit the forest road for the 20 minute drive back into the woods riding into Beartown Wilderness and the community of Poor Valley. Rugged country it is back here. Yes you’d have to have some determination to live here now and back in the day. A hiker sets on side of the trail close to our pullover spot, a car already here as well. He is wet and sweating. I ask if he needs a ride but he is just resting before the big climb to Chestnut Ridge. (Hey ya’ll remember this one don’t ya? Our first overnight ever in the woods and good ol Lead Dog plans a 10 miler for the first day and the last 5 miles are well….ALL UP!!!) This hiker is from Maine and we talk of the 100 mile wilderness and me wanting to return sooner than later. He’s been here before and looks forward to the shelter but isn’t staying there tonight.The sky begins to rumble, closer, closer. Bonnie it’s a comin girl! Get your rain jacket, pants. Hail pellets too. We continue to walk. Hummm I wore my summer red’s today, my non-gortex trail runners. Bad choice I’m thinking but turns out they dry twice over and my feet never feel wet all day. I bet that Slim Jim guy wished these storms on me, Fair Weather Girl. I got mine today Slim. I had to be here and so be it. Rain or Shine!!The trail works up our body heat so we stay warm and soon are out of all rain attire and gasping for breath. WATER! To drink that is. Head’s down the spring flowers give us something to enjoy. Purple violets and little white flowers. May Apple form in bunches almost ready to bloom. Look a Lady Slipper!! Just one gathering of 3 pods hanging their heads waiting on that next ray of light to allow them to wake up. We meet many hikers today. One couple heading off the mountain from an extra early ascent who say the light show this morning from Chestnut Knob Shelter was quite the sight. They seemed to enjoy it. Had I’d been on the ridge just might have been scared. Soon Bonnie and I reach the open fields, 2 miles to go I say. She has not been here before and I am glad it isn’t foggy just overcast which might have been a blessing. The trail cuts through patches of orchards. Yellow finches dart from tree to tree. Cherry blossoms and apple trees bloom, how nice. The pond and water source come next. Now I remember just how far it is down South of the shelter. Best get water here if you are traveling north and out - but never mind coming back for it if you are already at the shelter. To FAR, right Larry?!! Read journal from October 2010 if you want to know more about that.The fields continue on as if to repeat themselves. Each time you see woods you think the shelter is there but no just a little farther. And there it is. Rock building erected with a fire tower years ago but tower torn down now. The Maine hiker is here and finished his lunch. He heads for Jenkins shelter. Soon a couple arrives from Indiana. Wet and ready to dry out. Also looking for flat country like home, Ha we say not in these parts. Bonnie and I check out the Garden. Trees have grown up since last visit and make the view prohibited and with the hazy skies don’t do it justice. We take photos anyway. By now the sun has peeked out a bit and warming things nicely. We head back down. Here’s where the hikers really start coming by, total of about 7.. One fellow with a husky who was carrying his own doggy pack AND a chain leash. Wow that’s gotta get heavy. Then more single hikers each saying there are heading to Maine or hopefully as far as they can go, some young some older. Before we know it we are closing in on the forest road and our car. Time flies when you’re having fun. Ah cold beverage. Say here comes another hiker Bonnie. Hey you wanna a cold drink? Hiker Keith says some catchy one liner like does a bear shit in the woods or something like that and guzzles it down. He’s from Bland area and worked as Missionary in the Philippines for 6 months with his wife. Missionary was his given trail name aka Missy for short. HA! I say you don’t look like a Missy. 60 years old his wife gave him a bucket list and this adventure was on it. He’s determined to finish, as he took 2 weeks off for a foot injury. And says it’s all about luck, that you never know what will happen either here or back home. Says he will continue on God willing. So we wish him well yelling that’ll be some feat Missy.","FS 222

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347374,"8:09PMSticky and Tired I am. So ready for bed my eyes can barely stay open to write. Have I only been out here 1 day and heck only a ½ day at that. Must have been the early rise and drive down that got to me. Temps were rather hot today as well. I worked hard yesterday readying our yard before leaving for this trip and wore my body out. Shoot this 30lb pack ain’t helping either. But 30 isn’t bad considering I’m toting a 2 man tent and extra food for Larry when he comes in tomorrow. 15 tents are in camp already tonight. Several are staying in the shelter as well. Fire is going to keep the bugs away and most of us have turned in for the night. If we only knew what this night was to hold….Jim and I met at Fort Chiswell this morning at 7:30am traveling to Tom’s house in Damascus for shuttle to Wilber Rd near Watauga. A few hikers were passing over the road when we parked, most of which we meet later in this trip if not all in Damascus. Heading up the trail my pack weighs heavy at first. Been a while since had this on. Jim is light baby light. 17 pounds in his make shift pack with what looks like a car window shade hanging off the side. Yep that’s his sleeping pad. Tent what tent he don’t need no stinking tent. Just a $6 homemade tarp for him. I’d like to see this stuff last weeks out here. But for now light is right!!Sweat drips from my nose leaving spots on the dirt. Jim chatters along with not a care in the world. Look you can see the lake from here. He hadn’t even noticed. A talking fool this boy is. I thought Bonnie had the gift for gab. Just excited about this trip and of course a chance or two to blast me from bailing last trip, Fair Weather Girl! “Hope it doesn’t rain on our parade”.Soon we reach Vandeventer Shelter, 4 miles down on this 11 mile day. Many hikers are resting up in the shade. Damn hot day. Haze hangs over the lake washing out this grand view. I hop on the rocks behind the shelter for my lunch while Jim sets up his ‘sleeping pad’ for cushion against a tree. Gobbling down homemade gorp Jim calls his mom to update her on our progress. She following on her schedule he has left her. Finishing lunch we follow in behind Ella and her dog Guiseppe. She’s a quick stepper, just disappears in the woods like an ancient Indian myth, her dog never making a sound. This continual up is really pushing us today. Glad we only have 11 miles instead of like 23! Jim has already been talking of trail magic coming our way. He knows it’s out there. CheezeBurger please. If not we’ll have to wait on Quincey’s in town 2 ½ days from now. A spring crossing halts us. Need more water and boy is it good and cold. Wish it was running more cause I’d have my feet in it. We bring out Captain’s gravity fed water filter. This is Jim’s first use of it and works well for us. No where to hang so we take turns holding while the water drains in our bottles. Only 3 more miles to go, the skies begin to rumble. Jim recalls something he read about straggling out space between hikers to give that lightening less chance to hit all in a bunch. I double time to rid myself of him. No not really but we do get a chuckle of what if’s. “If it hit’s you Martha I don’t think I could provide decent enough CPR to save you” Ha you’re out too Jim. The skies darken but no rain or wind to show its really coming. The leaves didn’t even turn over on the trees. We should be approaching the next Gap, Turkeypen, not far now and then the powerline. Hurry Jim I don’t want to set up camp in the rain. We opt out of gathering water for the night at the source prior to Iron Mtn Shelter. Camp will be crowded for sure. A pack of hikers are already laid out in the shelter. Bags and mats with no room to even drop a pack. I scope for tent spot and make haste before the storm rolls in. Jim follows suite as other hikers arrive all evening, 4ish now. “Say Martha that tents not big enough for you and Larry” Funny that’s what he said. They don’t make a 52 FAT!!! I like it just fine as it is twice what I usually carry and have my gear on each side with me in the middle, NICE. After gathering water and cooking we decide to visit with those congregating at the shelter. By this time like 20 of us. Say is that a gun in the guys pack? Turns out what looked like gun case, stock end, was a trail guitar. It’s passed around for those who can make music giving it a strum. I tell them of what’s in store at Damascus. Some tried to get rooms in town but waited to late. No worries folks you got a REAL tent city to hold you. Their eyes glass over when we tell them of Cheeseburger, onion rings and PBR- Free showers and food at the Big white church-Eating contests too. Oh and don’t forget to come to The Captain’s Hiker Feed in two weeks. They check their trail books and make notes. With that, good night all, I head to my ‘big tent’. I say as I put my light out, hope it doesn’t rain, Jim’s gonna get wet.","Wilber Road-Watauga

It’s just behind the shelter like a lion ready to pounce us. The MSR decal illuminates on my tent flashing with light. CRACK, BOOM, BAM. Dear God Spare me. The light show starts at 10:30pm“Oh my, Jim Jim, get in here!” His tarp has to be ready for flight by now. I hear tent stakes clicking together like he might be packing up and running for the shelter. I dare not look out, to scared. My neighbor’s tent is just feet from me. I hear him moving about too. What’s going on out there? My heart fills my throat, beating fast. Riders of the storm we are. No room in the shelter I must stay put. Iron Mountain roars, CLAP the last big bang, all hikers gasp and quite stills the air….2:00AM It’s Back. Rain awakens me and then the down pour comes. I grab my headlamp and scan all around the edges of my tent. First time in this stuff and sure hope it holds. I vision Jim watching all tents flick on as hikers do the same as I. Skies growl and I exit again.4:30AM Pop, Pop rain bounces off the tent. I’m too tired to care. Get me to 6AM and I’m out of here. Awaiting the rain to lighten I stir awake and get my rain gear ready for what ever is out there. Sure Hope I just find Jim still alive. I’m not the only one ready to leave this mountain. Hikers rustle all about, some soaked and accessing damages. Jim raises his head, boggin pulled down tight and trash bag close by used as a rain shield. He has made it and all dry too. Gumby, my neighbor, has a case of the wet ass. Tent pooled water under his feet and sleeping bag wet. Not good. He wants that $6 tarp now!!7ishAM Packed up and ready to roll. A warm morning too. Hopefully the sun will pop out and we can dry our gear. 16 miles today. Some at camp are doing the marathon to town, 26, God Bless’em. Jim tries to convince me we could join in on that fun. Not a chance man. I feel good but not that good. We take turns leading setting our own pace to push the other. 4 miles down, Uncle Nick’s Gravestone. Lived Alone, Suffered Alone, Died Alone it reads. Nice view from his place but way out here for sure. Hope we have trail magic. Jim wills it to happen. The road 91 is just ahead it is possible. A big orange metal box appears. Open it up, hurry, no time to read this disclosure taped to the top. I’ll take that Orange drink, RC for me, Ginger Ale, Ella drinks one down too. The tool box holds little debbies, WOW. Jim smiles big. Hitting 91 road we take a break to eat a little something more and dry an item or two. The sun is out big now and feels great. An open field is ahead and quite inviting. A grassy field wide open and cut with a gravel graded handicap path. Very accommodating for those who need a push and they can stop a bench to look over Shady Valley. The miles really click off now. Up and down small hills with cresting views. May Apple is everywhere. Lady Slippers hide amongst the woods. We decide to press for Rt 421 for our lunch stop and water reload. I hear the road, motorcycles coming and going. Hikers are on both sides of the road resting. A concrete picnic table has our names on it. We invite other to join us. Gumby is here, feet are spent. He’s going to town to shoe shop. Says is Soloman pair aren't cutting it. Paid $125 and getting about .33cents a mile. Now that’s calculating it out. Another gal has hurt knees and coming off too. A trail angel is there and gives them a lift. The other young marathoners are bound to hike it out. NO JIM I AIN’T GOING WITH THEM. He continues to prod me. I’m going to meet my man and Abingdon Gap.5miles to go and we shall be at our night’s stop. Crossing McQueens’ Knob which is a bit of a pull we take a water break and add socks under Jim shoulder straps. The old rug sack is wearing on his skin. McQueen’s Knob shelter is close. The Holiday Inn it is called and actually etched on this head board. This small make shift shelter was once used back in early ATC days but is now merely a reminder of hard times. Wonder if Larry will be at the road down here? Tom is to shuttle him up about 5:00. We’ll be in front of him. 1 mile walk for him into our camp tonight. Hope he’ll make it. LOLThe gap opens up to the shelter and loads of grassy spots for tents. A southbound lane is warn to another tenting area above. We stop at the forks and declare our spots. Feels good to lye down. We hear the water source is quite the trek down the side of the mountain, 275 yards, steep. Damn. We suck it up and do it. Team work and some sweat goes a long way. It helped our fellow hikers coming in late too. We shared. Even shared my stove too to a gal who’s went out. At least a hot meal for one night for her. He’ll be coming down the mountain when he comes!! Ol Larry rolls in about 6:30. Sweat showing thru his ‘cotton’ shirt and on his back once his pack comes off. No wonder he’s carried in trail magic, Cold brews on ice. Now that’s a MAN. I cook while the boys gather firewood and our night will be set. Dusk sets in and still hikers are bound for town.

The threat of rain still looms and most of camp headed out early including us. Just having your things loaded in your pack makes things easier even if rain does come. 10 miles to cover, come on Larry you can do it. He’s all smiles with his light pack and knowing it’s all down hill from here. Yea right. How about some hills sprinkled in for good measures.We did have some entertainment on the way. First there was Marathon Man. A quick talking, hippy haired dude, who left his tent at the state line and hiking out to ‘the road’ and back. If you look on the Trail Days website he ends up leading the parade baby. Look for the Green Hair. Next there was Kitchen Sink. He came up on us toting a grocery bag and I thought it was really just that but turns out he was picking up trash. It was full too. He too had hiked the AT years ago. Now he hiked from New Orleans up thur TN and here he is. Gonna work at Trail Days. Quite the poet and philosopher. Pressing for town my feet start to holler. Down down begins about 8 miles in. I started counting campsites to keep my mind off of it. 6 total counted from the Gap to here so guessing a lot of those who passed yesterday stayed out here before reaching town. I’d like to try out that Backbone Rock Trail as well. We begin to hear the sounds of town. Cars, lawn mowers, the smell of Quincy’s. Breaking out into a freshly mown yard we are here. I love this place. To Tom’s we go. I gotta get a shower before I eat boys. Just the way it is. A cold drink, a cool set on the porch, ah don’t get no better than this. You did it Larry you did it. “Too bad you and Jim didn’t just come on into town yesterday” he says. “Wouldn’t have bothered me none” HA that’s my man.

Coming out of my tent camped snuggly under the trees of Tom and Sandy’s yard I take in my surroundings. I’m ready to start Trail Days.We browsed the vendor stations for new gear and ideas for adventures to come. Captain and I even interviewed with Osprey about our passion for the trail. Oh and you can’t say you’ve been the Trail Days without visiting tent city. This is where the pilgrimage of hikers stay. Tents shoulder to shoulder in an open field and those looking for a more secluded place will be tucked within nooks and crannies along the creek bank. Riff Raff, Billville, the fire ring. Thomp Thomp Thomp the drums go each night with a circle of wildness. Don’t go in…you’ll never get out!!!There was mud and there was rain. Not a Trail Daze without that too. Bands played at the gazebo and hikers performed their talents too. Speaking of talents, the hiker parade has a load of that and some things best left unsaid. We sported our Hokie Hiker theme and did our best to make a statement. Balloon wars broke between parade participants and the locals. Water guns fired and hoses spouted from the buildings. Our very own The Captain came armed with a fire extinguisher pressurized to shoot water as least 20 feet. Every pretty girl in a white tee shirt was fair game!!I myself the water challenge to another level when a little rascal blasted me from behind right in the behind. Charged with adrenaline I swiped her water hose from her hand and gave her a good drowning. All in fun mom, don’t kick my ass for shooting your little girl. LOL ..the parade marches on.See my photos for all the action captured. We did have a fantastic time. I truly want to thank our gracious hosts in town.

With every zip of the line another hiker arrived following the signs to The Captains. Burgers, Dogs, Westnile Beans, Salads and Chilies, Deviled Eggs, Chips and Fruit, Desserts and Cold Beverages. A Hiker’s dream, heck my dream!!!We fed nearly 100 I’d say including helpers and passerbys. Hikers from Maine, Germany, Netherlands and all over the US. Corn hole competition started up in the early morning while we put up feeding stations and iced the drinks. Sunny skies kept the crowd in good spirits along with ‘extra’ spirits. Some hikers returned from last year giving yet another shot at completing the AT. Cope was one in particular. He came in Friday night and was rarin to go for the weekend. Our friends Jim and I met on our trek into Damascus made it too. Scout Dog and his masters, Gumby, Rolling Stone, and Marathon Man. Remember he led the hiker parade with green hair and that fast pace step along with his quick talk? Captain’s family had already been quite the hosts Friday night, cooking spaghetti for a few early arrivals. Then Saturday morning reinforcements arrived in stages. First myself, Wildman Dustin, Slim Jim, Bonnie and Jeff. Then Harry, Miss Betty and Dana and Ian. The last waive was Noni and Denny, bringing even more food. WOW. Once the grill cooled off some when water walking to cool off and some well just fell in. Man Down, Man Down. Hey now that’s a guy with priorities. Threw his phone out, kept his beer upright all while heading face first down the bank to the creek. Slim Jim, You alright? Snap Snap I take my photos. I’m here to help ya know. ;o)Let the Hiker Olympics begin. MORE COW BELL!!!! That was the signal of each event and ending. Be creative; make something out of aluminum foil. You’ll have to check the photos on these. (Yes I have all the photos. No camera mishaps this year. Good thing that port-a-john had the warning sign this time). Too explicit for me to write about but let’s just say the guy (Cope) with the ‘package’ won!!! Watch out he’ll squirt you! From the world’s lightest backpack to lightest sleeping bag, to designer glasses and campsite recreations they were all good.Next events were waste no water with teams pitching water from the creek, bucket to bucket to fill a final one to the brim. Some quick fillers won hands down for those pints of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. Bobbing for marshmallows was a hit too. No hands please. My favorite, Backpack Scavenger, always gets a good laugh. Me naming off a list of odd items to see if 1 hiker has them all. 18 out of 25 was had by one lucky lady, Chickadee. And lucky she was in more ways than one that day, say Wildman?!Lastly we had Bear Bag toss and Nature Hunt. Ropes hung from the trees while other teams worked hard to gather crawdads and Joe pie Weed and other specimens around the Captain Quarters. He of course was our only judge in this event, the wizard of the woods has the last say.Our last event and by far the best was Garry Williams’ Bluegrass Band. What better way to spend an evening on Stony Creek than with a banjo plucking and some sweet harmony of that high lonesome sound. We taught them hikers how to really flatfoot and hoedown. Sure hope we get them back next year and for longer.Yes The Captain’s place is good stuff. Happy Hikers awoke the next day to head back out for Maine. Some waking more quickly than others. We wished them well and all asked is for them to send a postcard photo of their summiting Katahdin. Now THAT’s good stuff.","Trail Daze

The Potts Creek Railroad line was turned into a nice grade of path leading thru the forest lined with green grasses and coal cinders. We had a good sized group today hitting the trail with 7 and looking for that 8th hiker, Talkin Tim. He’s a new guy to our area by way of the army and home town being Wisconsin. Say Where’s the Cheeze? He took some time finding the trailhead coming from New Castle and ended up joining us as we were on our way back, finishing the last 1 or so mile with company.The morning woods revived me. I’ve been craving some trail action and this was just the cure. Larry was trilled to be walking flat ground and only having 6 miles in front of him to finish. This whole trail one way is 4.5 miles. We started on the closest end to Captain’s house, 7 mile drive, walking toward the trestle junction ( 3 miles) and turning around. We paired in two’s for easy talking as the path is wide enough for a four wheeler, which we saw by the way even though signs forbid it. Hey we are close to WVA aren’t we? Anything goes baby. Chatting we passed by several coal clumps which Captain says were spit from the old steam engines that ran this rail years ago. No need for blazes on this path, just follow the old railroad bed. A few benches were placed along the trail too.Captain’s knee is healing nicely and this was a good start to the hiking season for a test run. Slow and steady he was. I set no records myself as I have to get those trail legs and lungs back myself. Yo Maatha, we ain’t gonna do all this trail are we? Jeff calls out. Well that would be 9 miles out and back if we did Jeff. “Oh no, my shorts have a tag that says, only good for 7 miles or will self destruct’! Needless to say we didn’t leave Jeff in smoking drawls. Coming to the trestle junction a sign tells us about the size of this gorge and how the bridge was made; only tall trees to see now and a switched back path down to the creek. I must see!!! Bonnie, Lindsey, myself and Captain head down. The bench at the plaque, well, was too inviting for the boys and Miss Shirley elected to supervise them in our absence. Now this is more like it. Down each turn I was back on the AT like trail towards to creek. The water was running pretty good to from the days before down pour. I had to taste it, umm good. Captain pointed out the block pillars that still remained and how the rail used to run. Imagine a gap filled 100 feet deep with wood crisscrossed to fill the height and then the trestle measured 600 feet wide. All made by hand. I can’t! After scouting we returned to meet our resting soles and return back to our cars. All the way talking about that good cooking awaiting us at The Swinging Bridge Restaurant in Paint Bank.","The Captains House

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362114,"Well I tried to let ol Larry pick the hike today. Cascades was his destination. Just a 2 miler in and out, he’s been here before, he knew what was in store, he even selected our meeting time in the parking, 9:30am. Besides what would be the rush over there since we ONLY were hiking 4 miles? A little lady was checking the parking pass drop box as we rolled in the lot oh about 9:50, Bonnie just arriving herself. See I told you we didn’t need to rush, Larry says. My feet itching to get out of this truck to kick some tail I mean trail. Anxious I was. Just a few cars here. Just wait it will be full when we come out I know it. Ginger and Bonnie are ready to go as I tap my foot while Larry piddles in his things before we can get started. I point out on the kiosk map how the trail near the top can be extended on to another overlook called Barneys Wall. Did you just feel those eyes of Larry’s cut towards the skies for some heavenly help for him? Bonnie says I’m game!!! Smile…. that’s all I needed to hear. Off we go on the lower cascade trail which is our favorite entrance passing along the creek all the way to the falls. The rocks are slick with rain from early this morning but the air is fresh with a hint of humidity. Fallen leaves have started to color the path. I do love this time of year.We have the trail mostly to ourselves. We take the time to check out the creek below at each bridge crossing, any fish? We speculate where we could catch them, we only need The Captain to confirm. The creek is still quite low. Shoot we reached the falls without even hearing the roar. It sort of snuck up on me so to speak. Still a fantastic sight even thought the Falls were quite light, thin streams flowing across its edge not the rushing waters usually seen. College kids stroll right up to the rock ledges just barely immersed in the residual water running off. I slip out to take a photo and remember back in the winter when this was a solid block of ice and the falls almost frozen thru. Wow!There was no spray from the falls as we walked up the wooden steps to the observatory platform. Most of the time you get soaked here but not today. Onward up we go to connect to the conservancy trail…my next adventure. Say where does this take us? Oh about another 2 miles UP BABY! Larry looks again to the heavens for some divine intervention. Barney’s Wall is up there guys you gotta see it. The grade is an easy climb, forest road wide, lined with rhododendron. We can hear the falls from here better than down below. The Little Cascades are just over there too I point. The Barney’s Wall sign says 1 ½ miles and I know now it’s time for the trail to turn more direct UP. Bonnie and Ginger grab their granny low gear. I lead the way looking over my shoulder to see if my man is still coming. So far, yes.Rhodes turn to hardwoods and we are back in the thick of things, now this is hiking. Quite now, just the sound of my breathing. Bonnie you still with me? Yep but Larry is missing. He has elected to turnabout and make his way back to the truck. It is Sunday football time ya know. I’d say the hardest is just about over. The first ½ mile on this side trail was the worst and then it became more gradual with some almost flat stretches to catch our wind. The blue skies peaked between the high trees but the clouds moved over quickly now and again. Once we reached the overlook it was quite clear. I was hoping we could see the trail below as I had done once before but too much leaf cover for that. Besides you don’t wanna get to close to the edge here cause the drop would be deadly. I’m not sure how far down but we sat well over the tree tops. The return hike was quick and pretty uneventful except for a quick thunder boomer which dumped a bucket of two of water on us. It felt pretty good too. We had our rain jackets on just to keep from getting totally soaked but our gear quickly dried as we walked right out of it. More and more people began coming in now too. Some 10 at a time. Glad we’re traveling this way as we emerged from the woods to a parking lot full of cars. Larry sat in his truck reading his sports page with a big grin on his face and a cold beverage in hand. It ain’t too tough ladies.","Parking Lot

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363404,"Waiting on a sunny day at the top of Dragon’s Tooth we look out over the valley, the leaves have turned faded rusty now and a warm breeze dries the sweat from our faces. Wonder how far they are behind us Bonnie? A young fellow from Indiana summits and we ask if he has seen our Captain and Larry. Oh yea I did, they are about 20 minutes back. Soon the chatter of a debate is heard, the mutter of opposing parties, then the L-Train appears and the Captain softly words a Hootie Hoot and proclaims, I MADE IT!!! Wonderful words to hear from our dear friend who has fought back from heart surgery and knee surgery in the last year. I cry now while I write.We had discussed the hardness of this terrain and if he was ready to tackle it and he said yes. “If I can do this I can do just about any trail around here.” So in the cool burn off of a frosty morning we dropped a car at Trout Creek and headed over the mountain to parking below the tooth.Taking our places Larry selects a spot with Captain so they can ‘take their time to discuss the finer things in life’ and who knows what all. They drift out of sight. Bonnie and I trudge on to the rocks. A tough little hike this is up the 2 ½ miles to the top. Some steep steps and some grab a tree to pull your self up spots. We take our time so not to lose footing and to not get so far in front of our boys. A very warm day it has become. Clear as far as you can see. Look past McAfee, there are the Peaks of Otter, now that’s pretty darn far! We meet some folks already coming back down from the tooth and a few overnight hikers coming out for the day. Good to see some little guys with dads too on their adventures. My legs tire reaching our lunch spot where we will wait on the fellas. It will be a longer afternoon since this isn’t the half way mark I say. 4.5 miles to go. Hope everyone can keep that pep up to the finish line, there’s Ironto’s Mountain View Italian Kitchen awaiting. Now you’d think with that bate of food to look forward to my man might go light for his lunch selection. I have packed him a nice ripe pear and some trail mix. Oh hell no he pulls out what looks like a weekend’s food sack for 2. With a big smile he opens up a bag of chicken and pulls out a spoon. Anybody want some? There’s spam and candy bars and who knows what all in there. Must have weighed 2 lbs. Needless to say that pear hiked back off the mountain… in my pack!Get ready for some down guys. Rocks and down testing our knees and legs for stamina. I know I have a ways to go to get back in shape myself. I feel it! Not long we have a break or so and can actually walk a path. Cooler on this side of the mountain too, north side but we hike south, ironic.   3 miles down and not far to go we run into a young twosome hiking south as well. They are out for a month, the guy from NY, the gal from Georgia. They have met in the middle and are hiking as far or as short as they can go. They have no set schedule just where ever the trail takes them. They started at 311 below McAfee’s knob. Just over this hill Bonnie and we’ll be done.Mean while the fellows are coming along behind us I project them to finish about 4:00. We have since reach the car and found a setting spot atop our coolers watching a few back road travelers come by. We discuss our tree knowledge wondering if correct fom the day and will confer with the tree wizard upon his arrival. I hear them Bonnie but I can’t see them up there can you? Holy pete they are coming down the road. Did Captain pull another adventure trek again? Sure enough opting to take a hill less treacherous they turn off the trail at the Pickles Branch Shelter. A fire road leads down around that last hill and hits the road. Larry was quizzed on their directional orientation to see if he knew where the old man was taking him and he passed. Good lord I hope this doesn’t come to be norm now….we’ll never know where these two will end up at the end of the day.","Rt. 623

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363956,"I just love going to new trails. It is always an adventure and exciting. We’ve driven thru Backbone rock many times going to sections of the AT but never walked across it. I’ve been researching it on the internet and discovered work was being done on a parking lot and guardrails being installed to protect us from ourselves.Harry met us at Wytheville as he straggles in from yet another destination work venue. Always on the go we just never know when he will drop in to hike. Was good to have him back today. Reaching the Rock overpass we parked just beyond it on the side of the road. Only a car or so here now on this cool morning. I almost put on my gloves but with a few sharp climbs up the man made steps I was warm. Sun shines bright today too so should be a perfect day for a hike. Captain’s knee will get a quick test as the steps are steep and not for the short legged. I’m sorta glad for the rails at this point, it is slippy wet and covered with leaves. Once on top we cat walked all the way across the ‘backbone’ of the rock. Way cool.Following the blue blazes we intend to connect to the AT in about 2 ½ miles. Captain wastes no time with his pop quizzes. “So Harry what plant is this? If it ain’t Hillsville then what?” You’d have to be a local to get his one but if you know your towns you’ll get it…Galax, that is right!! My turn.. I spot some leaves which I believe are teaberry but I see no red berries so not sure. I refer to our wizard woodsman before taking a taste and he confers. YES Teaberry!! Other quizzes popped up to test our biblical knowledge, so can you name the women of the bible? You already hike with one name sake…Soon our path hits some quite steep ups with my calves burning like they haven’t yet this season. We have waited a few times on Captain just to keep close and make sure progress is ok. This last hill I’m ready to power up and wait at the top. Harry takes rest on a nice forest made bench. “This is what separates Lead Dog from the pack”.With each section of climb we come closer to our junction. I spot a yellow image. Looks like a tent but too tall then realize it is a person on a log and there’s our metal sign. We are here. It’s a little early for us to eat lunch but we do stop to chat with this fellow. He is from PA, Chief is his trailname, who is sectioning the AT and has started at Roan Mountain for this trip. His wife shuttles him about every 5 days or so and he will finish up I do believe in Damascus. I think he said he was retired too and then heading to see grandkids in Ohio to celebrate. Congrats!! We have about 4.5 miles to go now and will stop for lunch at the TN/VA state line. I am quick to recall our last hike here just this May coming in for trail days and meeting The Kitchen Sink and Marathon Man. What a pair of characters! Wonder if Marathon man’s tent will still be short of the state line? It wasn’t I looked.Resting over lunch we all agree how good it felt to be back out on the trail. Talk of next weekend’s overnight, gear to bring and gear I shall be purchasing today. YES I have new sleeping bag waiting for me at Mount Rogers Outfitters (MRO), a versilite western mountaineer 10 degree. Cozy I will be. An easy walk from here, we recollect doing this last 3.5 miles in an hour and 20 minutes a few years back, now that cookin. I take in the last of the turning leaves, just a few spotted with bright yellow/orange leaves still dressed to impress. Down Down with long switchbacks the time flies with Harry and I chatting about tv shows. We emerge from the woods and spot a patch of money plant that has turned white silver for the season and admire the log home who’s property the trail passes thru before turning into the creeper trail for the finish. ‘I could live in this town with both chime in’. I do love it’s laid back feel and connection to nature. Captain is soon behind us just 15 minutes past. He is picking up the step my friends. Lock your women and girls up he’s hot on the loose. Well carrying that polka-dot bag maybe not!! He drapes his clothes bag over his arm like a church lady heading to the Sunday morning meeting. All he needs now is a little attitude as he walks off to change.","Backbone Rock

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/364211,"What better place to gather than at Partnership Shelter? It’s close to the road, Route 16, close to a ranger’s station with an outside phone for hikers to call in a pizza for delivery, it has a spigot for a water source and nice privy, heck in the summer has a hot shower. But the best thing Partnership has to offer is it’s a place for friends to gather, therefore I’d like to call it Friendship Manor. And the stories goes….Friday morning couldn’t come quick enough. Jim and I had conversed more times than I could count on planning this trip. We have Harry coming to meet us at THE BARN restaurant in Groseclose and then Captain will join us tonight after getting off work, meeting up at ‘Friendship Manor’. I roll into the parking lot with my new sleeping bag packed and warmer gear as the wind is hollowing today and it is November ya know so not sure just how cold it might get each night. All morning I felt like I had forgotten something and then it hits me while cutting off the engine…MY STICKS!! Holy Shit I have forgotten my sticks. Now this wouldn’t be such a fear had I not been carrying a full pack and had some aches in this old body, knee especially. My heart races and my mind clicks thru ideas. I’ll call Captain, he will be coming this way tonight and can stop by my house and get them, Larry can leave outside. This can’t help me today but will tomorrow anyways. The boys pull in.Slim Jim, my old Carroll County high school friend and The Straggler, from anywhere, anyplace, aka Bluefield has made it. I have already gone in the restaurant to inform them we will be parking till Sunday and ask if any hikers have left poles behind, no luck. Harry sorts thru his van of gear randomly packed, “say do I have enough gear? I feel like a girl deciding what to where to the prom” But at least I have packed my sticks!! Ha Ha Harry very funny. We put on our packs and head off for the trail but first a quick stop at the Shop EZ so Harry can get something for his lunch.11.6 miles to Partnership. First stop will be the Old Settlers Museum in the little community of Lindamood. Meandering the fields we progressively climb away from the interstate. My legs already start to burn. I’ve been working out at the gym and thank goodness or I’d be dieing. You wouldn’t believe sticks help that much but they do. Reaching the 1800 school house we check out the inside and read the rules for not only the students but teachers as well. The old farm house close by is quite inviting and we do look into the out buildings before moving on connecting back to the AT. Slim Jim has a great way of breaking up the day, giving us various stopping points to look forward to, up next Chatfield Shelter. This Lead Dog is taking second spot today as each climb takes some fortitude to push through and I can’t make quite as quick a step as usual. Remember I have no damn sticks! “Say Miss Maatha take one of mine Harry offers. I’ll take a turn using that 10degree bag tonight” HA he only hopes. I grit my teeth and carefully step across the rocks of the stream. “Lead dog is like Teflon….she’s non-stick”. Guess that’s my name today. All joking aside the fellas were quite the gentleman offering their stick, note not plural, I’ll give ya one if you need. And they did on some occasions and I graciously accepted. Thank you!!Stopping at Chatfield Shelter for a snack we don’t stay too long. The wind still throws a bite once the sweet cools. We don’t add layers with the climb of Glade Mountain a head of us. We just grin and bare it. Jim is in short sleeves a little to brazen for me. While Harry sports his cotton..”It kills ya know”! Cresting the ridge we can see out now, the few clouds of the morning have blown out. Clear and Cool.Heading down Glade we are bound for a side road for lunch. I am ready too. My breakfast has long burned off. It might be 30 and with the wind who knows the temp. The gap here allows some protection but we all dig in the packs for a down coat. The sun feels good, we compare lunches and talk of eating that pizza tonight that Captain will be delivering. One more big climb for the day and in fact of this whole trip lies ahead, Locust Mountain. This should be smooth sailing from now on…NOT, who put all these rocks under the leaves? Glad Jim spots a make shift hiking stick for me. I break it down for my height. It has saved my knees. Ouch my toes!, Harry cries.The rangers station isn’t far now and that means the shelter is too. We talk of popping in the station to warm a bit and change before settling in for the night. They don’t close till 4:30 and we should be there way before then. Approaching the road we see a locked gate, crap it’s a holiday, Veteran’s Day. We knew that, we just talked about it being Armistice Day 11-11-11 but got caught up in warming inside. The shelter will have to do.Arriving early we wonder if we’ll have dibs on sleeping arrangements. It’s a big shelter with a loft so should be more than enough room. A gal greets us in the parking lot on the path in, she’s from Chapel Hill and I honestly thought she was a ranger heading to her car. Turns out she’s hiked the AT in 2009 and is out finishing a 3 week stretch. T-Bone, a older gentleman, has hooked up with her for a few weeks. He is a South Bounder from Florida. They inform us 5 other guys have been staying in the loft. They are on their second zero day. So the shelter isn’t full by any means but we had planned on staying in the loft and with a cold night ahead I decide a tent will be much warmer. I start violating the rules. See there is no camping within a ½ mile on either side of the shelter. I guess to keep down riff raff. Also a big sign on the shelter NO ALCOHOL. Say T-Bone you wanna shot of this Captain Morgan’s? Boy did he jump to his spindly little legs and shiver over with his cup and a smile. VIOLATOR!!! No, the IS Friendship Manor.Harry disappears…what’s that he’s carrying out of the woods? GeoCash. He’s stashed his tent, water, sodas and other goodies from the day before. You little rascal. You could have picked my tent up so I wouldn’t have to carry it. I had already given Captain reinforcements for tonight last week in a cooler. Sodas and a few cold brews. After setting up my camp, Harry sets his tent up too, we meet the other SOBOS here. (Oh Jim goes Thru-Hiker all the way and sets up his bunk on the shelter’s lower floor.) “I’ll turn you into a thru-hiker before it’s all over Lead Dog”, He states. Footwork and CoCoToes are round their ready built fire. They have gathered fire wood too. This should be great. Captain is bringing in fire wood too. They love us already. Harry had given these same guys a ride Thursday into Marion. The other 3 of their group, aka The Rescue Squad, are in town for the night or who know how long. They have been gone since 2:00 and it is now going on 6:30. Good and dark now and our bellies are growling for that pizza delivery. 6:54 Captain calls and he’s in Marion. We go to the gate to wait.About the time he pulls in another car stops too. It’s the 3 lost soles getting a ride back with some Marion beauties. They have to say good bye. We all gather around the fire, eating pizza and having drinks and telling stories. Section hiking vs Thru hiking and what classifies either a true hike or not. The Rescue Squad carries on into the night with the light of the Taurus Moon. Pretty appropriate since this means the Bull is Charging as of November 10, 2011. Well one charged right down on all fours tossing his cookies. Too much American Honey, Evan Williams versions. We had long turned in and I hear from my tent…the BU-ICKk pull up looking for RAL-PH and EAR-L. It was bad. He went on for an hour. Soon the moon moves over my tent illuminating like a spot light. Everything is quite, just a leaf slides off the tent. I snuggle down cozy in that new warm sleeping bag. Ahh this is nice","Groseclose

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/364215,"Winds have calmed and a few of us begin to rise for the morning. Rustling around in our tent, Captain and I sort our gear. Harry expects us to burst out fully packed and ready to go with all the commotion we are generating. I begin to toss my things out of the tent for packing like a kid looking for a lost quarter in his toy box. The only thing I truly make sure I have before I plan to leave are my sticks. I almost slept with them last night. Jim was first out with a great photo of the sunrise along with the fire. He was quick to post on facebook. We say our good byes to T-Bone and Biscuit (Chapel Hill gal) and leave some pizza and 2 drinks for the Rescue Squad. They haven’t come to just yet but they said they will clock 22 miles today, destination Hurricane Shelter. A nice trail this morning through a tunnel of Catawba rhododendrons. We warm quickly and I have to come out of my long johns. I normally don’t start out with them but it was cold on the wake up. Captain and Jim have taken a break at the powerline while Harry has blistered the trail and was out front for a far piece. I go to catch him.I’m back. In step and in stride. I feel good today. Catching Harry, we separate the parties literally, Politically. Bang Bang a gun shot, then two. A big buck scampers in the gap above us crossing the trail in retreat. Run boy run. We all have blaze orange on or something of loud color. Or as Jim says he’s just loud enough that they’ll hear him.We gather up at a forest road once again for a snack and find a muzzle loading tool in the leaves. Captain is quick to identify as we all have no clue what the metal gadget is. No hunters are spotted just a few in trucks passing when we hit the South Fork of the Holston River. Harry and I arrive here about 30 minutes before Jim and Captain. We meet 2 day hikers and they have seen hunters earlier this morning. It’s close to 12:30 now. We fully expected the Squad to come flying past us during the day but no sign. Wonder if they have left and we bet on what time. Here at South Fork the trail crosses the road and a busy road it is too. Would be an easy out if we needed one. A big bridge leads over the river and a sign in box for hikers to state their destination and mode of travel which we find odd since foot travel is all that’s supposed to be on the AT. Funny some have noted Boot as their mode. One even says flying. Captain takes a rest while eating lying down. He is tired and hot. This will be his longest hike since surgeries at 10.6 miles. We have 2.8 to go.We check our water and decide to not pass on a good stream to reload instead of waiting to see what the shelter source will provide. We have heard not so good there. I notice Harry is sheepishly quite. “No I’ll pass, I’m good on water”. My pack is now a little heavier but not far to go. Up and over these last few knolls and we’ll be in the open fields.Coming down to the last forest road crossing of our trip I tie an aqua bandana to the AT sign. Larry is to come park here and walk the last 1.5 miles in along with a buddy named Webb. This will be Webb’s first AT hike and overnight. Larry has helped him with packing, yep you heard right. The L-Train is all knowing of the hiking experience….As he proclaims, I AM THRU-HIKING!!! LOL with me now. Once again Harry wonders off except I get to follow this time. He’s done it again. Another GeoCash. Except this time it’s for all of us. Wow, potato chips, dip, peanuts, soda WOW again. Oh and a pillow for himself NICE. We suck down a soda a piece and help haul in supplies. Sneaky rascal.Reaching the field the white marks are on fence posts stretched out between thistle bushes. Cows greet us along the way. Sure hope the L-Train gets here before dark so he can find his way. He’s bringing our subs from the same pizza place as last night. I can see him now…wondering from tree to tree, post to post, stuck in thistles then giving up and settling down in the sleeping bag munching on all that food and grinning from ear to ear. Oh he’d be listening to his radio for football scores and entertaining Webb with old ‘war’ stories. Jim hikes up front looking for an old school bus we’ve seen pictures of on trail journals. It is gone. Bummer I was really looking forward to the candid moment. Entering back into the woods it’s not far now till the blue blaze cut off for our shelter. Trimpi Time.A couple is here with their 2 lassie dogs. They are from Speedwell and have come up the side trail, Slabtown. We visit and others come in. Tinny and BobWhite. Captain had provided them the use of his home just a few days ago. They knew of our trip and how great they just by chance came down to the shelter for a break and found us there. Harry’s food stash is made quick work off as BobWhite almost devours a bag of chips and most of the dip. Glad those subs haven’t arrived yet we might have been one short. The girls head on south. Slim Jim packed in a saw and he has begun cutting up long, arm size logs for burning tonight. I packed in birch bark from our trees at home and newspaper and begin building a Bear Girls fire. One strike and she should be good to go. In the mean time Captain is setting up his newest gear purchase. You’d think he’d have it all by now but there’s nothing new he’s not gonna try. A big surprise…Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo II. It’s a tarp tent with an inside attachable net and tub floor. Shaves 2 more pounds compared to his other. Before long he’ll be carrying all he needs in a lunch box. Choo Choo I hear the L-Train comin. They are picking up wood on their way in. Good boys. We have collected quite the stack for tonight. Webb is quick to begin working for his stay. Ha. Sawing and gathering wood. We show him around so to speak and give him some pointers on food storage and teach him hiker talk. Larry pulled a Twit, that’s his town name, ha, drove his pickup truck. We talked about bringing the van so we would be warmer on that shuttle back tomorrow and in case of rain. Well the truck it will be. Quick get those subs distributed we are starving once again. A tall thermos of hot chocolate to boot. Thanks for carrying Webb. Jim and Captain string up a left behind blue tarp. See this shelter is just like Pine Swamp, made identical with fireplace inside the rock walls. Jim intends to turn this into an Indian Sweet Lodge. Look out!!! Fire pops and cracks, warmth fills the room. No need for extra layers tonight gonna be nice in here. I might even have to come out of my sleeping bag. HA HA!!! A little smoke fills the air along with strange stories of farts gone by. Don’t ask, you have to come to find out. L-Train turns on the radio and gets those game scores and dominates the ‘radio time’ yet another job he could find himself doing if his heart desired. Captain is tucked tight in his bag for the night, it is dark ya know. Webb laughs till his belly hurts with all the crazy tales. Yep this is what it’s about, having fun with friends. Harry has gone to his tent now and I have bedded down myself. Larry continues to talk a bit and stokes the fire. It’s getting about midnight now the wood is holding on pretty good but Larry elects to make sure. So out the tarp hole he goes. A saw begins to saw. Hear that? I can’t see Harry but I know he’s wondering what the hell is goin on up there, he’s down below the shelter for his camp. Saw Saw, Jim raises up, L-Train’s on a missing ain’t he?!! Gotta love him. He’d rustle and then stoke, and then stoke and then rustle. He was our own little shelter mouse prowling in the night. I drift off…","Partnership Shelter

Each person that got up for a night relief would add a stick to the fire. We had good coals come morning. I was first out today and got that sunrise photo. It was subdued with cloud cover but vibrant pink/orange just the same. A really warm morning compared to yesterday.One by one we rise and pack up gear. Tarp goes down and a departing shot of the shelter before we leave. Jim and I had considered hiking back by way of the Slabtown side trail but I think best we hike out together back thru that field. I like it there and we’ll see the cows again. Reminds me of home.My hair’s a wreck and it’s too warm for my wool hat so off it comes. What a freight, Webb’s eyes open wide and WOW. Guess he’s not used to the Wild women comin out in me. HA. Hope I haven’t scared him from coming back.We chat about the next hike, I’m game for keep going today, sketti hike is upcoming. Can’t wait for Captain’s special sauce and I inform Jim he’d better get in line first or Harry will have his share downed in a blink of an eye. The Barn awaits us today though.Loading up in the bed of the pickup truck we are true hiker trash. Captain takes dibs on that front seat with the heater and driver L-Train. The rest of us are left to batten down the hatches and ready ourselves for that crisp ride thru the country side back to Rt. 16 and Captain’s rig. It was quite exhilarating at first, felt like a kid going to the farm again but soon turned to “are we there yet?” Webb’s eyes begin to water and Jim is shaking cold. Harry and I have the best seats next to the cab. We decide to check the activity at Partnership Shelter when we arrive. Wondering if the boys have left the shelter on what would be their 3rd zero day. Some other young SOBOs are there, Yep they are still in the loft they say. Had 11 hikers stay there last night. I holler up top, “is puker up there?” Should I call 911? They get good laugh and say they will be leaving today. So here we were right back where we started from, “Friendship Manor”. Meeting up with old friends and making new ones. Again that’s what it’s all about…sharing the trail with friends…Let’s go eat guys!","Trimpi Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/364516,"I’m still not sure how this rock formation got its name, Hayrock. It doesn’t look like a stack of Hay. Maybe someone came on it and say HAY look at this ROCK. It is quite the mass jetting up from the ground, leaning over the trail as if it could slam on you any minute. However I can vouch for my little group Saturday it wasn’t much in their book. “Heck we passed all the GREAT rock overlooks on the way to this place.” “Why aren’t we stopping at THIS rock?”I chose a hike with a view and a trail destination “overlook” and of course a place hopefully less traveled by hunters. It is rifle season ya know. So we hit the trail at the park-n-ride off the Daleville/Troutville exit for a 4 mile out and back. The lot was full but the trail was sparse only 1 hiker spotted on our way up to the ridge.L-Train and The Straggler were quick to team up on ol Lead Dog today. Shoot we hadn’t hardly hit the first white blaze and Larry was asking if we turn right wouldn’t we come out at the Pizza Hut. Why yes, but we aren’t going that way my dear, see up there? That’s our destination. He turned to Harry looking for some back up counter remark.Still hearing the interstate we hiked away from civilization however we ran across some trees marked with round metal tags and numbers. Lots of them and orange ribbons tied too. Lots of work went into this but no idea why.Hiking along I keep peeping over my shoulder just to keep my eye on these 2. Hell they might turn around and really head back to Pizza Hut. Soon we reach the foot of Tinker Mountain and begin our only real climb of the day about 2 miles up switchbacks to the power lines. I hear the humm long before I see them. Closer and Closer the humm turns to a Long BUZZZ. Then this massive tower becomes the AT. Wow. The boys arrive and declare this is such a nice view why continue. Too much buzzing for me in all manners of the word and I lead on. Ridge walking we go. Pines around us and rocks in our path but easy walking really. Carvins Cove to our left and Botetourt to our right. The population over the county has grown drastically since my last hike here. Rows of houses every where. They have no idea we are up here. Reaching our second overlook of the Cove we take a break and scan the valley for local landmarks. The boys pick out the airport runway and shopping centers, I take in the cove and how full it is this year. All the little necks are filled with water, nice. “Is this Hayrock?” Nope we have about 2 more miles to go. ‘Why?” Why would we wanna leave this?” Cause Lead Dog says so. GEEZPlugging along the ridge the air is still cool and an extra jacket needed. A sunny day with just a few wispy clouds. With each little up I keep warm and I hear the fellows chattering behind me. Now we all know if the hike is ‘that bad’ there would be no chatter. HA However with each little down I do wonder where that Hayrock is. It’s been like 5 years since I walked out to it this way. We should be there by now. Hey Lead Dog we are losing valuable elevation here. It’s up here I shout, hang on. I hootie hoot to verify. “What? This is it? You’d thought I had led them into a deep dark hole to the edge of the earth. No accolades at all. They just plopped down in the leaves on its edge and ragged on how the view was obstructed by all these trees. You can still see the cove guys. Besides we have followed it all day let’s go see this big ol rock. Come on down here and walk underneath with me. See all the graffiti and stuff. Nah we’re fine right here. We laugh and keep the snide remarks flowing and do enjoy our lunch stop passing an orange moon pie to share. Some kind of good. Larry talks of Italian food coming after the hike and lays his head back to rest. Harry just encourages him dang it. I myself walked out here to see this here rock and I’m gonna do just that. I climb down around the edge where the trail leads and see if anything has changed since my last visit. I find a make shift lean-to like Bear Grills makes in the wild for shelter. Cool. More graffiti unfortunately marks the rocks but only so high, it’s out of the vandals reach. A fire pit sets back next to a huge area which looked inviting had I’d been looking for a shelter spot.Climbing back up to join my ‘happy family’ we head back for the day. The boys chatter fades as I draw away from them on the ridge. I only hear them every now and again as the switchbacks carry their voices down to me. A few more hikers are coming in for the afternoon. Then I see a train of blaze orange. Hunters!! Four of them are just passing thru they tell me. One talks on his walkie talkie. My guys see them later and 2 are already set up in their blinds and others are scattering. We saw no guns and Larry speculated they were tracking an earlier kill. Glad we are heading out way before dusk or we might end up the same. Heck you’d thought my guys were shot and wounded by their moanin and groanin all day. Enough already you losers.","Rt. 220 Daleville/Troutville

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/365032,"“Well i-dee-clare” That’s what my granny would always say if we did something weird or out of this world. You know a little something that just wasn’t quite right. Boy did I hear a lot of I declares this weekend. You’d thought we were going up against Everest or jumping out of a plane. I declare I will not hike this gorge again. I declare I will only hike it this direction. I-dee-clare, I-dee-clare!!! Shoot I just i-dee-clared them back that they’d love it today and they almost did. All those bad memories of some previous trips to the Gorge were almost dispelled but it took most of the day and a completed loop to confirm. Gathering at the Rocky Knob Campground we came from all directions, Slim Jim from Hillsville, Harry from Bluefield, me in Dublin and Miss Bon from Christiansburg. See they will come near and far to hike this loop. Now I didn’t call this meeting place but was sure to approve of it and set the wheels in motion when Jim brought it up. We hopped out of our cars and quickly got on the gloves and wool hats to block out the winds of the knob. Temps forecasted in the 40s but a mere 24 right now. Sticks everyone and off we go.Discussions had already taken place of the direction to be taking today. This 11 mile loop has some quite drastic descents and assents. With a coating in leaves they can be quite treacherous. Also discussed was the motion of some as this being their “last hoorah to this God For Saken Place.” The declarations fly.Up the first field we go counter-clockwise. The wind cuts across my right side keeping it froze till I can warm up with exertion. The ground is rock hard and only prickle bushes survive in this openness. Looking over our shoulders we can see for miles and we have miles to go today. Harry falls to the rear of the pack taking the Sweepers position but I suspect he is only looking for an opportunity to ditch a side path back to the cars. He already had mentioned the need for someone to watching them due to ‘vandals I the neighborhood’. Funny he’s the one with his face covered like a bank robber and hood up. We reach the shelter of Rocky Knob.I always enjoy stopping here and hiking in this direction we come to it at the very beginning of the day and catch some clear views over the gorge. This shelter was once part of the AT back in the 30’s when the trail ran in conjunction with the Blue Ridge Parkway. But we get no AT credit today someone states. HA Harry hides in the corner for a rest and in hopes we might just leave him. See he is the one who stayed out all night ‘flying around’. Yea he got in the plane of his and took Betty to the WVA basketball game and didn’t put his little head on a pillow till 1:00am. Then having to get up for this DARN hike he didn’t manage enough shut eye. So tired he is and all those bad memories of LAST hike are weighing him down something awful. Blow downs, I hope there are no blow downs. We maneuvered like 12 a few years ago and Slim Jim’s last trip was in knee deep snow drifts and hard to find trail blazes. He brought his sleeping bag and cook stove oh and water filter. He’s not getting caught out…without!!! What’s wrong with these boys? Bonnie and I buck up and lead them on. Across the upper Saddle and down to the parkway overlooks we go making good time and feeling good. The hard rains from last week have soaked the ground but that water has frozen and only sprouts of ice cover the trail. It’s like ice grass shooting up. The last field we see the stages for the Floyd Fest Music Festival. We are only minutes away from this event site from the trail but we confer we’d surely not find our way back to a stealth camp in the woods if we ventured there this summer. ;o) I do love this trail because it wraps so many things a trail can offer into one. A loop for one is perfect, no retracing your steps, some fields for openness and views, some parkway signs for history, and now for some ‘real hiking’…those paths lane just on the edge of a mountain big enough for the width of two boots and walking sticks. Now that’s hiking!!!Immersing ourselves in the woods the rhododendrons are plentiful their root systems cut under the trail making footing wobbly. I declare that “I’d much rather go down at the beginning of the day” Wait a minute did I just say that? Harry is quick to catch the quote of the day…which was totally taken out of context. My point was going down a steep knotty section is easier early on your legs since they are fresh but I’d much rather go up ANY day with not much preference when. Boy did I just double talk? Or just stick my foot in my mouth? The troops laugh to stopping in trail. Slim Jim says we need a tape recorder to catch all the muffle talk. Rock Castle is just up a head guys and then we’ll have lunch at that chimney. Large boulders stack on top of one another and giant granite towers make up the castle. We hear the water in the gorge pretty loud now. Glad those new bridges were built a few years ago or we’d be fording. We’ve come 5.2 miles. The sign says 5.6 to go. Not bad since the next 2 miles or so will be all forest road down. Well I have to say this is when my legs began to talk to me. Right knee twinges and balls of feet begin to burn. Bonnie says here feet are hurting too. We have several little creeks to cross all from the mountain run off too. Usually these are just hop overs but today we have to really rock hop and be careful to keep our feet from getting wet. It’s also much cooler over on this north slope which is totally in the shade. Don’t wish it away too much cause that 3 mile climb awaits to reach our cars. So they aren’t done here at the fire gate? No Harry we didn’t leave cars here. RATS!!!Passing the CC Camp they have put in bear boxes at each campsite. Guess them boy scouts aren’t trained to throw those bear ropes for hanging their food. They need the Captain’s coaching on that. 3 mile climb is here. The moment we’ve been waiting for aka dreading. Take off that extra layer and wool hat cause your gonna heat up quick and we did. The sun beats on our backs even though we can still see our breath. Jim takes the lead but soon after the first hard pull takes a breather. Guess that sugar lunch didn’t pack enough power for the gorge. I’m feelin fine and ready to roll. Bonnie and Harry approach us and are in shortsleeves now. WOW. She gives me the evil eye and I think the bird. I look away. HAHarry asks about a ski lift to the top.I jump to the lead and press on. I know more muffled talk is gonna fly so I better be out of ear shot. The climb reminds me some of Katahdin only that the steps are steep between and your eyes are looking at the ground which is in your face. Sticks give you more power to push up to the next ledge but sometimes it’s almost better to do the scamper and crawl. I glance back and down like 50 feet and see my troops. They tell me later they’d look to find me and then realize I was way above them. Look to the tree tops guys. 30 minutes later we’ve reached the summit so to speak. We still have a little more climb to our cars but the gorge is behind us. So glad we didn’t go down this. Way too treacherous with all the leaves. Some places our toes were pointed to the sky while walking on our heels. Now that will give those calves a good stretchin out. “Doesn’t that give you since of accomplishment?” I get a few nods. Harry even smiles. I know it’s his fair-well smile to this trail but that’s ok. At least he came back for another go around. Slim Jim, I think he’ll be back too. Maybe not in knee deep snow though.Bonnie will be back I know it. We’ve come here too many times not to keep the good times rollin. I-dee-clare that was some hike!!","Rock Castle Gorge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/365353,"Say Harry, and others, hope you had a good Christmas cause if you didn’t then you’re really gonna be sorry you missed this event. Best weather we’ve had for a sketti hike, temps well above freezing unlike last years frigid 10 degrees. Sunny skies above, full falls to view and a supper sized pot of Captain’s famous family sketti sauce to devour.It was the quickest my Larry Eugene has ever hiked. Just the FAB 3 today, meeting at the Cascades parking lot this late morning. Yes I was convinced to hold off to 10:30AM, beginning this {hard} 4 mile round trip to the falls. Gave ol Larry some extra shut eye time and our friend Slim Jim extra travel time too. Now boys we still don’t want to be late!! We have been invited to join in on a family/sketti feast and grubbin is to start at 1:00. Just a few cars now but many more to fill the lot later. I chatted with a few couples heading up along with us. One lady had been here before some several years ago and they were brining some friends along with them. I’m sure a lot of folks here today are doing the same. As usual we hit the lower trail first and will return down the forest road/upper trail. Larry is a quick stepper this morning leading the way and working up quite the sweat. NO time for talk all hike mode he is in. Jim and I chat about the trail and that what better place to be on a holiday weekend than right here in Giles County. We hardly get to the second bridge before Larry asks if we are there yet, WHEN’S SPAGETTI? The creek along our path is rushing full and actually gives off a misty chill in the air. We all know in this holler the sun don’t shine but 2 full hours a day. HA I do love coming back here. Don’t get me wrong now, I wish we could have hiked all the way across Peter’s Mountain and really worked up that appetite but today’s jaunt will do just fine to burn off say the first plate full. Ain’t that right Harry??Hearing the falls roar I prepare my camera to get that first full shot. It’s almost running as loud as I’ve heard before. Many extra water run offs are along the trail especially the one closest to the new rock walk way. It actually is running in the trail here and will soon be a frozen block come later in the winter. We don’t tarry long and take a few snap shots and head for the upper trail. The boys get there sports talk fix in while I catch my stride and trek on. I miss Captain not being with us today. Doesn’t seem like a true sketti hike without him but he’s in the kitchen and all his family are visiting. We shall roll in like true hiker trash and crash the party. And that we did. The yard was full of cars like tents at hiker feed. 1 lone tent standing on display – his new hyperlite for all to check out. The smell of sauce engulfed the house, a long line began to form, oh no will it happen again??? Will the sauce run out? Quickly I scan the room to make sure Harry hasn’t popped in by surprise and hid in a closest some where. Shooo, We are safe!!!Five pounds of hamburger, loads of fresh tomatoes and seasoning. The FAB 3 wait patiently for the Captain and all to go thru first. Jim sneaks a slab of his cherry cheese cake right before setting out for everyone. “No need to let folks feel bad for getting that first slice, His eyes popping. Wow he’s a good cook too. This might have to be a standard part of the feed from now on, Jim. I load up my plate with the sides running over and yes I got that second scoop of sauce for old time sake.Thank you Captain for sharing your family fun with hiker friends. We look forward to another visit.","The Cascades

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/365589,"What better way to end the year than with a hike. I am excited about doing this section again; it’s been a few years since I last walked it. We have a shuttle today to cut down on the travel time to drop cars and then pick up after we finish. Stepping out of my car the wind cuts right thru my hiking pants. Damn did I need to wear long johns? It’s supposed to be sunny, warm like 50. Hell no it ain’t no 50. Try 30 and slight overcast and grey. I walk into The Barn and the gals remember me from our last visit here. Oh it’s a hiker, your shuttle will be here shortly, Linda says. Her husband, Skip, is our ride. She flips another egg and offers me a cup of coffee.Slim Jim is still in for the holidays and picked this hike out for us. We both have New Year’s Eve parties tonight and thought a good hike is just what we needed. Skip loads us up and we’re off for 42, O’lystery Picnic Shelter. Skip tells us all about his shuttle service and the many characters he’s made acquaintance with. We found interesting the picnic shelter was used for grocery drop off for hikers. They would call in their order and put money in the rafters of the shelter marked with blue, red or yellow paint. Saying money is under Blue rafter for So and So Hiker. He said he’d never been duped. However he had one hiker he was ready to leave on the side of the road with his smart mouth. LOL The craziest story was when he took a lady hiker and her mid-wife to a place she wanted to birth her baby. Yep wild and all nat-ur-ral!!! Thanks for the stories Skip and we’ll see you later this eve. We walk around that picnic shelter looking up to see if we can see the colored rafters. Glad we walked this little bit behind here Jim or I’d missed a few white blazes. Crossing the road we are out of the harsh winds and into the woods. YeeehoooShouldn’t we be nearing The Mill soon? Yep is up around this next bend. The trail progresses up and above North Fork of the Holston River. Looking off we do see the old structure. Wow it is big. Missing many boards and has been reinforced with cement pillars so not to fall in. We can’t help but walk to take a closer look. Check out the high water mark, 5 feet. Not a place I’d like to ford then. Board walks are built along here too. Big railroad ties lain out side by side to keep us from getting soggy feet in the bogs. Black Angus cattle greet us coming into their field. Two little calfs play in the morning light and give us a look every now and again. Time to knock out this first climb, Big Walker Mountain. The trail used to come along the top of here but I’ve never seen exactly where. About 800 feet of elevation change and I feel the leg burn. It’s graded pretty well but Jim declares a break is still called for. How about a chocolate break for a pick me up, I say. Reminds me of Sandra D’s mini bits she’d have stored up for after her lunch. Just a tad will do. Recharged we crest the top and start the descent to Crawfish Valley where we’ll have our lunch. There’s a couple of side trails we take notice of and decide we should figure out exactly where they might connect in from. We’ll do that with some internet searching. Protected by the wind we chow. However it’s still cool by this creek, damp, so we don’t hang out long and take out to tackle our next mountain, Gullion. This son of a gun just kept going. One false summit after like 3. I hit granny low and powered up to the top. Jim is right behind me ready for a drink of water. Dang I don’t remember this.   All down hill from here and about 2.5 miles till the old shelter site, Davis Path. I still can’t figure why the conversancy decided to tear down this shelter. Basically left just the floor and steps. I wouldn’t set my tent up on it but guess you could cowboy camp as it’s the only level spot. Jim said there was tales of too many parties going on but seems too far from the road for that. We both were ready for a set down. Jim pulled his breaks off on the down hill getting here and let the legs run wild and I tried to keep up. Too long of strides for this gal. Pounding the feet takes a toll on ya. I prefer the smooth and steady pace. We soon hear the interstate traffic and open up in the valley field. Groseclose is just ahead. The sun tries to peek out but the clouds just a little too thick to get any real warmth and the wind is still pesky. But that is all forgotten while we chat about trail books and the Barefoot Sister’s journey. Still hard to believe they hiked with no shoes and then turned around and did it again to get back home in Maine. The barn is in site now, our finish line. Wonder how many hikers have passed under this interstate bellies gnawing for town food? It’s not a big town but just enough to satisfy. And satisfy our hiker hunger it did.Setting in the parking lot we recount the day and how good it was to get that last hike in for 2011. An older gentleman approaches; he owns most of the land around here. Leases the barn and lives beside it. He recalls the old train stop this once was and how things have changed since. The AT ‘took’ 120 acres of his land he says but doesn’t seem too upset about it but did note how the fields have grown up. The wind blows cold and we must now depart. Happy hiking he says and come back. Oh yes we’ll be back. It may be the end of the year but our journey still remains on the trail.","Rt. 42 O'Lystery Picnic Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/365591,"Happy New Year!!! Flip that calendar and let’s tally up some more miles. You don’t have to walk the AT to get your trail fix but it sure helps to be close to it. The Captain and I connected up just below the Doc’s Knob area where what they call the Watershed path. No hunters here today but we’ve seen this pull off be a true hunters paradise with tents and trucks packed like sardines. Just the lone HIKUPIT rig today.We’ve already dropped his car over in Narrows where the Mill Creek Trail head is. We are adventure hiking today connecting various side paths, yes paths, no trail markings for most of the day or blazes to follow. I’m in the Captain’s hands for direction. We’ve hiked this before so I’m not totally in the dark. Quizzing grade about a B- I’d say with me missing a few directional questions.Welcome Old Man Winter today. Wow 30s with a north wind chill. Flurries dancing in the air. My fingers take a good 20 minutes to warm normal at the start. We have our yak traks just in case and our down coats. Heck I have my down vest on now and keep it on all day. Leaves on rhododendrons are turned under tight. About as closed as I’ve seen all year. We are protected in here for a good couple of miles before reaching the ridge. Train sounds gust above us as the trees sway about. Man hope this lays a bit. Captain spots a four wheeler track and says that’s our queue to follow as these will lead us to Sentinel Point, our next big turn and only overlook for the day. We progress along the ridge just below its crest to avoid total wind lash. The tree stands become more abundant and well designed. Some having only steps and a platform to total enclosure with gun holes for peeking and shooting. We find the “animal camera” fastened to a tree, making faces at it in case they are still checking film. They’ll have some questions on what kind of animals we exactly are. HASoon we reach a mountain cabin. Brand new it is and just beside the old one we saw last trip. Humm they’ve build a privacy wall between then and no trespassing signs are all around. A family feud Captain proclaims. Blankenships and McCoy’s. Well not sure about the later but sounds better with another name involved don’t it? We move along quick in case someone might be around even though we see no trucks. The four wheeler tracks become fainter but we keep following. Some bushwhacking and log hopping needed here and then we spot the open cut. The tall power line which runs to the valley and the town of Narrows and then opposite over to Angels Rest area. The Appalachian trail just a ridge apart from us. Hurry Captain, Stand here I’ll get a quick photo. Let’s get off this open area before our heads blow off. Man it was fierce. Just a few feet after departing on to our next path the quite comes over us and calm. The hollowing winds have been left on the ridge and we have escaped to peaceful trail. We are now on the Mill Creek Trail system , rock cairns and hand made painted signs will guide us out. I have the map the maker, Bob Robertson, has designed to accompany his work and work it is. Miles of connecting paths all made by him. They say he’s up in here all the time. Well maintained, hope he has help.Headed for the Shortcut path and the pine thicket for lunch we must go down down. My toes crunch in my shoes. Captain shuffles along keeping short steps to not fall. Come on old man I’m hungry. We’ve got a few twists and turns upward before we make it there and I know he’s ready for lunch too. Here have some of this magic chocolate. Yep the same batch as last hike with Jim. It will fortify you for sure. One down his hatch and one to suck on I’m left empty handed. Well guess that’s better than the Captain swirling around like a stoned man on a diabetic buzz. There are the signs we are here. Let’s eat. Hot soups and crackers go well with reminiscing of trails gone by and upcoming treks to complete. Stamina and strength and all that training ahead of us to be ready for our walkabout in the Smokies this April. I can’t wait.We pack it up and head for the next junction, Catwalk. This trail will take use closer to Mill Creek the trail’s name sake and the old water reservoir for Narrows. We first must navigate this water crossing. Shit I forgot about this, I say. We waded thru in the spring, was a hot day. Not today boys and girls. We’d lose our toes and maybe feet trying that today. The water is swift and to high for rock hopping. Captain scopes out where currents have gathered limbs and a small tree for crossing. You first I say. Steady, He grabs laurel branches close by for support, the log begins to turn. Step on it he shouts and I do righting him. One more step and he’s on the bank. WEW, my turn now. Hands gripped on limbs and toes curled like a monkey on a branch I scamper across. Captain catches me on the last lunge. SAFE!!! The catwalk is steep and pretty much straight down with now switchbacks. Quite the workout on the reverse. Leaves keep the trail tricky and The Captain is less sure footed. He still needs some more trail time to get his legs and confidence back. No worries I’ll get to crackin that whip. Move it move it move it!!! Sergeant Thomas unveils.Reaching yet another water crossing he notes this is the head waters of Angels Rest. Ya’ll know that faint water source .2 miles from the AT up there? Well it rushes to a full water fall here. I do a pole cross with my sticks and am on the other side easy. Captain surveys his options and does a short rock step and partial foot dip and lands across in my arms provided just for in case. SAFE #2!!!Rock cairns lead us down the winding rocky section while we are blasted by snow squalls and very cold winds. I’m ready for a warm truck I think to myself and soon we are out on the forest road. A house top and a truck spotted, we are here!! Captain shoots the shit with his fishin buddy, Timmy, who saw his truck parked below his house and he has been waiting for us to come out. He was making sure Captain was out safe and sound. Good man.

Now them fat boys might not hike the whole hike but hey they hiked their own hike and isn’t that what it’s all about anyways?The L-Train had to work hard to get him a hiking buddy today convincing Trucker Jeff to drop his load and come on. Was that just a funny or what? Larry even selected the direction from 42 in Newport/Level Green we’d hike. Old man Sarver’s Cabin is the destination.What was supposed to be a sunny day and warmer turned out to be more clouds than not with a breeze that had some dampness to it. Rain gear in tow just in case. Bonnie and I take the lead and the boys groan over just how far they might hike today. First we all must climb this knoll out of Sinking Creek. A large open grassy field with views back towards Kelly’s Knob and oh the Nascar Ladies house. Bet she’ll be down this way today patrollin her property for violators. We are safe, parked at a pull off up the road a bit from her land and the trail. The creek is running pretty full, we hear it coming down the other side of the field completing that first mile. The boys had the option of parking here where another parking area is. 1.3 miles to Sinking Creek Mountain the little footbridge sign says. That should be a good point for them to access their fortitude and decide whether to proceed or not.Look Bonnie there’s the big tree, The Keffer Oak, the largest blazed tree on the whole Appalachian Trail, aged some 300 hundred years old. Diameter like 20 feet. Its majestic limbs reached out around us like a prehistoric condor flapping her wings. We gathered up against the trunk for a photo op. We all looked tiny, even the fat boys!!Crossing into our last open field before the ‘real’ climb begins Bonnie and I take bets that our guys will drop out before reaching the crest of Sinking Creek Mtn. Shoot if they make it that far the worst is over and they could just come on to Sarver. We shall see.There is no false summit on this path. The white blazes give a distinct projection to what’s up ahead. Looking up each time I see yet another blaze and another blaze farther and higher they go. Bonnie’s steps draw short and I’m in what I call granny low keeping that persistent pace. Stick step stick step stick step. Legs burn and lungs gasp for some air. The boys are out of sight. I know we should be turning soon to the left and cresting, wonder if there will be snow left? Through the rhododendron knarls we are closing in. I hear voices. It has to be the guys Bonnie they are still coming. Fooled us! There is ice on that last rock ledge. I hear more voices then dog yowls. Hunters, Shit I forgot my blaze orange. I click my sticks and make my own noises so they know I’m coming up into sight. I do have bright colors on today but I don’t want to take any chances. Hey Hey I shout, How’s the hunting? Coon dogs and guns are everywhere. 5 hunters each 4 dogs per person. They aren’t much for conversation or photographs and ask my direction and that they intend to stay off the AT and head out the ridge and down to their trucks at 42. I let them know our boys are behind us and wish them good luck, I think?? Bonnie tries to text Jeff just to let them know we’ve made it to the top and bear hunters are about. No response.Ridge walking is always nice. You can see out both sides of the mountain. Still breezy, we put on a layer. Voices again…dogs, hunters. Three more hunters and one is a gal. They have blue tic hounds. One really likes me. We also let them know our guys are behind us and to keep a look out. They get a chuckle when I say they can’t keep up with us chics. The gal especially gives a big laugh. I think it says in the ‘hunter/AT handbook’ no firearms within 500 yards of the AT. Well I’m not looking to police this issue and all folks we encountered today were friendlies and nice enough locals I presumed.We shouldn’t be far from the orchards Bon. Yep the rock piles start to appear. A good 20 or so scatter the ridge top running in and out along the trail and between old fruit trees. There’s the junction sign too, we are here. A new trail sign has been placed and looks like the direction of the trail rerouted ahead off to the left to avoid the exposed rock ledges the old trail used to pass over. It was quite hard to follow the blazes and very treacherous during wet and snowy weather. About a ½ mile it says ALL DOWN HILL to the shelter and water. Oh yes I remember that. At least it is switch backed unlike years ago. Before a straight descent down the mouth of this holler led you to a corn crib called a shelter for the hikers. A mad hiker I would be coming to this location for water and shelter after a long day to end up with only a mud hole and fallin in shed. Since, a very nice shelter has been constructed and more attainable water noted down the way from it. Heading down we have already counted out the boys and not seeing them till we return. Warm sun rays barely shine thru the thick clouds while we have lunch at the shelter. A hiker approaches, could it be? Nope it’s a section hiker from all over he says. A tall lean aged man wearing shorts and rain jacket along with his blaze orange boggan. We direct him to the water source and inform him of the Sarver ruins which we plan to check out later and the cemetery. His eyes light up and off he goes. I’ve been looking forward to this hike and finding the lone lost cemetery. It’s been 2 years since I tried to find it and didn’t come across it then. We finish our lunch and leave our packs, taking our cameras and sticks to adventure hike.Passing the ruins all that is left of Mr. Sarver’s place are 2 large rock chimneys. The roof is totally fallen in as well as all the walls. The corn crib stands but is looking much worse too. Before long all that will be here are our memories and chimneys. Bonnie looks up the hill I plan to take her up for our adventure. “you know where you’re goin?” she says. Well sorta. I’m looking for a grouping of cedar trees. I take a diagonal approach from a big square rock setting to the side of the fire pit left by hikers/hunters. Bushwacking upwards passing between more rock piles and two big pines. This feels right. Just a bit further and I should see them; YES the cedar tops are spotted. I found it Bonnie!!! Five tall cedars mark the head of each grave site. A stone plaque and foot stone each. Fencing is partially around it. Head stone reads: Henry Sarver, Company C, 22 Virginia Infantry; In Memory of Daughter another reads. No engravings on the others. We also find a geocache box. I open it even though it warns not to. Two items have been left behind by others and a pill box with a small sign-in tablet and pencil enclosed. I replace all items as they were and once again leave the sight hoping to come back again and rediscover.Climbing back out back to the AT we run into a father and daughter. He greets us with “you girls must to Bonnie and Martha”. They have run into our guys. Yep we saw them at the crest of the mountain he says. “They described themselves as the Fat Boys” he chuckles and so do we. He said they are turning around and will see us at the car. His daughter is eager to hear about Sarver Holler as I tell them about the ruins and gravesite. He is familiar but hasn’t been here in 15 years. Happy trails we say and depart.A quick walk back across the ridge and down down Sinking Creek Mountain. We both guess them fellas have polished off all our refreshments and are kicked back in the truck listening to the radio. Some hikers they are. Reaching the open field overlooking where we parked I give a big whistle. I see their heads moving around under the hatch of my rig. “Well at least they made it out alive” Bonnie says as if they had been out for days. They have been counting up their mileage while waiting for us. 5 maybe 6 miles they confer. L-Train proclaims they even walked out to see the donkeys on Nascar Ladies land, “that had to be like another mile don’t ya think?” The hunters are all gathered around their truck now too, out from their hike. Pulling off my trail shoes I think what a completed day it has been and goes to show ya everyone hikes their own hike.","Rt. 42 Newport

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366166,"Chatting coming off the mountain I see an image up ahead. Looks like a man; he’s not moving, standing quite tall and with let’s say an attitude. Bonnie’s head is down walking behind me rattling off to me about being HooDoo’d. I tune her out and then the image speaks “Where have you been?” It’s Larry, he’s come up into the woods looking for us. I’ve been waiting since like 2:00, its 2:30 now. Bonnie says we’ve been out getting HooDoo’d. Let me explain….Coming over to Giles today the skies are blue bird blue and the air has the bite of winter. I sure hope the winds are calmer than the last few days. It snowed a little last night and I can see it dusted the mountains all around us. Great I say to myself, a snow hike!!Bonnie is waiting for me at the Angels Rest parking spot of Rt. 634 above Dairy Queen in Pearisburg. We plan to go up to the rest and then out to the overlook of Wilburn Valley and on to a power line cut. I’ve done this a few times and don’t really look at the map for mileage. Guessing it will be about 7, we calculate our arrival back time text our boys and head out. They are to meet us when we finish for a late lunch at the New River Grill. Yep our Fat Boys are ditching hiking today or they might meet for a short jaunt and drink before we come in, who knows. With the cold snap this morning I set up our departure time about 30 minutes later than usual to let the sun help warm the mountain. We head out close to 10:00.Bonnie’s scarf wisps in the wind about her head. We have liner gloves on and a pair over them. Long johns and wind stopper hats. We are geared for a cold walk. 1.7 miles of all up hill will help fight off most of the freeze, thermometer says 20 degrees but it doesn’t count wind chill. Not far in we have snow under foot. YES!!!The trail switchbacks us most of the way to the top and our first stop, the rocks below Angels Rest. The approach here steepens greatly with no ‘pull off spot’. Just rhododendron curled pencil tight engulfing the trail. I know we are almost at a “catch your breath place”. Blue sky colors a back drop behind the shrubs, the rocks of Angels Rest approach. My gloves have sweat beads on the outside and my back is wet when I take it off my pack. Bonnie gets some water while I set up my camera for a photo op. We venture on around the formations and follow the blue blazes to the actual view rock overlooking the New River and Pearisburg. The trail crews have cut some trees to allow more of a vantage point. Celanese is in full view now. Guess that’s good…Back up on the AT we head for Wilburn Valley overlook which only takes like 15 minutes. Now’s where the mileage gets a little sketchy. Remember I didn’t count up on the map; just by memory. It’s 11:00ish now and I’m thinking we’ll be at the lines in about 30 minutes and stop for lunch. That would put us back at the car say 1:30-2:00, which is what I told Larry. Passing the few lone rhododendrons up here, which are my landmarks, I know we are soon to arrive at our power line. It’s a nice walk with a little down grade. The winds have calmed nicely and we are plently warm and loving our hike. Time is flying by and so are the miles. Yes I say miles, well it was only 1 extra. I see the opening and cut of the trees. “See Bonnie I told you a power line was just up ahead. 12:18. Humm I must have miscalculated the trip. “But look there’s Narrows and look there’s the ridge before you come into Mill Creek Bonnie” I try to distract her from her watch.Pulling out the map while we eat lunch, from a fine rock seat I might add and sunshine on our faces and well just being out here, I count 2, 4 miles to the power line. Oopps!! “Yep You HooDoo’d me”, Bonnie mutters. Jeff said you’d do that to us and well you did it....I got HooDoo’d!” I give a little Cheshire grin and finish my lunch folding my map, guess we have 4 miles to go wink wink. Coming back was like lightening. Well for us maybe we knew how far we had to go back. But for Larry he figures we’ll be talking trail by the car long before now. He got about ½ mile in (more like 2 miles according to FAT BOY calculations) before spotting us coming down the trail…chatting…A hiking we will go, A hiking we will go, I HooDoo’d ol Bonnio and a hiking we will go. Yep a good hike it was and we got a little more trail time. Larry got his walk in too. HA and we all gathered for that late lunch at the New River Grill. Well Jeffie didn’t get to come he was trailer truckin but I’ll get my chance to HooDoo him later.","Rt. 634 Pearisburg

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366354,"Today was a day of wonder. In driving over to the trail I just couldn’t figure what the weather was going to bring me. I was pretty sure I would be hiking alone but still wondered if a buddy just might show. My plan was to hike past the Rice Fields to see if a sign Captain and I had placed there a year and half ago would be there. The wonder got to me. Arriving at the trail I notice the trail crews had really stepped up the markings. Blazes ran across the road and a nice double arrow gave easy direction for any newcomer. No other cars here though, I will be Lone Wolfin it today. Fog has socked in the mountain, temps are a damp 30. I have my rain gear in case, wool hat and extra layers. No long johns today I think, like I said it’s supposed to be in the upper 30s to 40s that would be too much. I think. I do love hiking this section; it is my safe haven for walking alone. I know the trail and where every landmark is and it’s so close to home for the drive over. I wonder what all my hiking buddies are doing today. I know where my dear husband is, cozy in the bed, dreaming of a double cheeseburger and biggy fries. HA Bonnie is with Jeff since he just got in from the road. Captain is probably working, the steam from his big plant, Celanese, fills the morning skies. Slim Jim is back home and lord knows where The Straggler is. I know where I’m at, the very place I live to be.With my mind as my only distraction today I have already wondered if I put my keys in my pack. Did I leave them on the bumper when gearing up? I stop to look. I have them and my phone too, good. Crossing the creek several times I am at the foot of Peter’s Mountain, time for this day to really begin.Feeling strong and with a little more pep in my step, I’m at the top of the first knoll in no time. The fog is thicker already and I haven’t come anywhere near to today’s peak elevation. Hope I can see up there? Sounds of the factory fill the woods. Not being able to catch its view the roars seem haunting out here alone. A big owl moves from its perch, wings flapping long and smooth disappearing into the white abyss. Soon I come into the long switchbacks and rocky sections of the mountain. I notice a white coating on the briars. Taking a closer inspection it is ice, rime ice, frozen fog. Wow the first of this year that I’ve seen. I thought I was getting a little cooler but had worked up such a warmth from the climb hadn’t really stopped to notice. Putting on my wool hat and another layer I trek on.My senses are more astute than normal from not only hiking by myself but being swallowed in this whiteness. The blazes are spotted but only a few at a time. A roaring above me becomes clearer, the crest is soon approaching, that’s the wind hollowing over the ridge. Rime ice has now covered everything but me. Quickly I stop to put on my rain pants for wind protection. Windstopper vest too. The tassels on my wool hat whirl around popping me in the face. I tie them under my chin and am glad I have my glasses on for eye protection. I laugh out loud literally at myself. This is what I came for so let’s enjoy it.Again my mind wonders what if a tree falls my way, would I survive it before rescue would come? Folks know my where abouts but it would be a mighty cold wait. I quickly lose that thought and am back tracking white blazes and taking in the awe of this winter wonderland. I can’t help but take picture after picture of it all. How can I capture what I’m seeing? Simply.. you can’t. The ice is like a feathery texture to each limb it forms on, projecting along just one side about an inch to 2 inches in width. Wind cuts off pieces landing them in the trail making me a clear white path to follow, it is magic. Of course those pieces that don’t land nicely are the ones pelting me like shards of glass. Ouch.Recognizing the cut of the mountain I know I’m half way across and just a few miles shy of the openness of the Rice Fields. There should be a gas line cut and then a powerline opening too. I wonder if I should stick to my plan and hike on to the water source? I will make that call at the fields.The stile should be just up ahead, another landmark to gage my progress. I am warm as toast. I’ve walked about as quick a pace as I can without a slight jog. Slim Jim would be proud. He’s a long strider to follow. It can’t be more than 11am.I see the wooden structure, the stile, Yes. It is coated like slim and crossing was quite tricky. Four points of contact and then a big fat ass on each board going off the down side. Nope I didn’t bust it I made sure of that!! Now’s the time to make the call, do I stop at the shelter for lunch and retreat? I’m not really hungry. I feel great. I’m warm. The weather isn’t worsening. It’s only 1.5 more miles out, but I have to come back. That’s 3 more miles to the day’s trip. I CAN DO IT!!!Charging up the open field the light of openness and out of tree cover is a nice change. Still socked in fog but brighter. The few pines along the field lines are draped heavy with ice. Beautiful! I look over to see if I can see the shelter, just barely. I wonder who was the last hiker to stay there? I will read the register when I return. Down and up the field and over yet another slickerly stile I’m off for a mad dash to the water source. Wonder how fast I can hike this mile and a half? I haven’t been this way in over a year and don’t remember a lot the trail here. Rocks make the stride hard to work. The weather station should be up here soon. Not WDBJ7 but a forestry center with all sorts of towers and receivers on it. Yep it’s here. Now what?More rime. The limbs are fighting me. Should I have stopped at the shelter? Once out of this little mess and I crank up the pace. I begin talking to myself. “If this down grade doesn’t come to the water I will turn around. Yes I know it’s down here I feel it” Quick Quick I’m almost in a jog. “Don’t stumble idiot.” There, there it is, wew. I check my watch 35 minutes. No way. Did I walk really that fast? The signs are placed at the foot of the trees we had nailed them too. Guess the trail crews corrected our ‘mistake’. But hey they are least here and the source is running just fine. H20!!!Now for the march back to the shelter for lunch. Every little step I remember with detail and it passes in a wink of an eye. I find myself talking again almost singing coming down and back up into the field. Oh I wonder, wonder who wrote the book of love I mean who would be at the shelter? I laugh out loud.Soups On and it is goooood. Warm and fortifying. Some register entries tell me THE Lone Wolf was here on his southbound trip 11/23/11 and then a couple stayed here bringing in the New Year. YES now that’s hiking. I myself must get to hiking and off of here. The chill is starting to set in and I feel my feet coolin off. I sign my Lead Dog and I’m out of here.My finish time is estimated to be 3:00 or that’s what I’ve told everyone. Let’s see if I can beat it. Again I work about as hard as I want to at this pace so as not to lose the enjoyment of hiking. Still feeling great. I see the resting tree, a long tree down right at the turn off the crest of this windy mountain. Coming off the noise lessons and I finally here the swish of my wind pants as I walk. The calmness is back and the woods come alive. Birds flutter from tree to tree. Woodpeckers and chickadees. Rime starts to disappear and the leaves on the ground start to take color. Each tree and lichen on the rocks stands out now. Funny normally this would just blend in but where everything was washed out white they are vibrant now. A slight ray of light comes over my shoulder on the last way down. I look back to see and the top of Peter’s mountain glistening white. It’s saying good bye Lead Dog you come back now and climb me again. I’ll see what else I can give you to wonder about.","Rt. 641

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/366677,"Hiking, Homeplace and Harmony is what we have in store today. The week couldn’t go by quick enough. Now we stand here at Andy Lane trail to get our hike on and see what the day shall bring.Bonnie and I met up at the park-n-ride this morning with Jeff dropping her off. He was quick to say he’d rather have his privates smashed in the barn doors than go on some 13 mile hike. Is it really that bad?? Jim is to meet us at the McAfee parking lot so we’ll have a car to hike back to this afternoon. Just a few cars there at 9:00ish. Good ol Andy Lane, a man who dedicated his life to maintaining ‘his’ trail and providing us a side trail to hit the AT half way between Daleville and Salem. Scorched Earth gap is our first check off point, 3.1 miles away. The morning is cool and clear. Jim sports a warmer than normal look. Cashmere sweater and some sort of wacky wrist bands. After closer inspection I notice they are cut off trail socks. Yep he has smartwool wrist warmers he calls them. I’m sweating just looking at them. Maybe on a 20 degree day but today??This is his first time on the Andy Lane trail and we give him point by point descriptions as we walk along. Enjoy this nice little valley Jim. Take in the farm and the cattle, tinker creek, we soon will hit the UP of this day. Closing in on the cement plant in easy view is our right turn up the mountain. Granny gear, hit that low gear and grind it out. Bonnie brings up the rear with a little sigh after that first big pull. Water I need water!!! The ground is mucky but not like I have seen it. Hill number 2 we face. My knees hitting my chin as I keep my head down and push with my sticks to make the elevation. Wow, who cut this trail? Jim exclaims. After a few long switchbacks I see the gap of light, Scorched Earth. Good thing we didn’t have to come the old route, it was much harder. A snack break and a photo on the big rock. Jim’s already taking about the Homeplace. We plan to eat there after we hike today. A hiker’s dream of all you can eat home cooking. Fried chicken, roast beef, veggies, biscuits, and cobbler. Are we there yet?Looking up the next ½ mile to Tinker Cliffs doesn’t look so bad. I guess knowing each bend and what’s around it helps too. I was hoping to be down to my shorts today. Figured I’d be hot enough with the climb but not yet. A light breeze had started and we expect it to be quite blustery on the cliffs. I love this section, standing on the cliffs looking out over the ridge the AT follows all the way to the big knob of McAfee. The valley separates this mountain range and the North Mountain where the AT used to follow. Sure glad somebody found these cool rock formations and moved the trail. The trail dances close the edge of the cliffs cutting in and out around sprawled out buck pines. We soon turn off the mountain for a steep decent into a gap where we’ll have our lunch.Bonnie and I scamper around on the next few rock formations making like the strong girls of a circus show acting like we are holding up some of the rock under passes. Slim Jim steps out front so he can stretch his long legs and makes quick time of our descent. Bonnie is fading behind and just might get lost in some of the deep leaf beds. She’s only 4 foot nothing ya know. Ah a warm place for lunch on this bank. We set down in the grass close to the trail, sun in our faces and wind to our backs. Feels good. “I can’t wait till supper time” Jim hardly eats a bit so to save all his stomach space for some ‘real food’. We girls snack lightly as well. Guessing we have about 7 miles to go, Bonnie’s ears perk up. She isn’t gonna get HooDoo’d today. She throws her shoulders back and glares at me, “I’ve been on this hike and I know exactly how far this one is!” Right now I know we have to climb this steep PUD. And there were several of those too. At least we have the views off either side of our ridge. Look!! Carvin’s Cove is coming into sight. ‘Where’s McAfee?” Bonnie shouts. Are you lost already Bon? We point her in the right direction to give her a landmark and goal to follow. Yes it seems a long way. Grey skies start to roll over and the wind is much colder now. An extra layer required and gloves for me. Our legs and feet are starting to feel the mileage. Just one more big hill to climb guys. That would be this side of McAfee, the shelter will be our resting stop Jim proclaims.The connecting ridge goes on farther than I remember. “Where’s the fire road?” I don’t remember this slight grade. Up by the way. Voices come up behind us. It’s a group of college students. A gal is close behind the leader who she calls Marathon man. He’s been keeping quite the pace. Bonnie is quick to point at me and says we have our own one of those, this is Lead Dog. They are walking our same trek today and are ready for McAfee and that parking lot. We let youth roll by and take up our own pace. Don’t you know youth burned out and we passed them just the same. Wink wink!!Visiting the shelter we eat a pick me up snack and gather our motivation for that one last push to the summit. Jim cools off by stripping off his sweater for his skin to dry leaving just his wacky wrist warmers on. I guess that’s for style points. Bonnie asked if she can just spend the night here. Come on troops lets show this mountain what we got left. Let’s just say some of us had some left and some didn’t. “Bonnie you comin?” Jim says. Her little legs churning like the little engine that could, I think I can I think I can. My sticks click to keep me in my pace. Jim is not far behind me. I hear the wind up top and see the trees swaying. I will need to put on my jacket once we crest but now I’m cookin. Meandering thru the large rock structures and twisted mountain Catawba the trail winds aimlessly. I feel like a pawn in a big maze. I hear the people. It will be busy at the rock overlook. I put on my jacket here and soon emerge to the openness.Wow this is what we hiked for..the vast view of Catawba Valley. Peaks of Otter can be seen, I wondered with the overcast. Look you can see the ½ mile rock ledges of Tinker Cliffs. More and more folks come up. We get a couple to take our group photo here and then on THE LEDGE, McAfee’s Knob. Jim, not so close! Set your ass down! Holy shit he has his legs hanging over the edge. I snap the camera as quick as I can so he can get back to safety. Let’s get off of here before we freeze or see someone else do so. There were more and more kids coming up the trail. Most not dressed for the changing temperatures. Short, tee shirts. Cotton kills ya know. Well except on Harry. He has some super powers as cotton doesn’t seem to faze our good hiking friend. 3.5 miles to go and my feet are really talking to me. Bonnie is short stepping now as we all are feeling the effects of double digit miles. The trail switchbacks us off the steepest parts now and we come to the fire road crossing and elect to take it the rest of the way. No need to hike over much traveled trail and many uneven slopes. 2:00, 3:00, more and more people still come up the trail. Do they not know it will be dark soon? Where’s your coat? Your water? Some are camping too and they look prepared good. Jim’s ready to call 911 and Channel 10 News to give them the latest breaking story of …Lost on the Mountain…Cotton Clad Kids die in the Cold. We on the other hand are out of here, bound for the HOMEPLACE....4:00 I see the road. My legs are walking but my mind doesn’t know it. It’s thinking of a warm car, cold beer and hot food. Bonnie and Jim give a yeepee and we dash across the highway to the safety of the parking lot, which by the way is packed. Everyone is still out there. I see the kids come out while we change our shoes. The gal raises her arms as if to cross the finish line of a big race. YES they have completed a great hike. YES WE have completed a great hike and there’s more to come…did I tell you already?...HOMEPLACE and bluegrass. We can’t get over to our other car fast enough, only hitting the high spots in the road. Bonnie says I bet there will be a line. Well she was right, try an hour. Guess we’ll have cocktail hour and warm in our car while resting our feet and legs. None of us wanted to stand for an hour after hiking 6. Happy Birthday Bonnie!! We celebrated her number whatever in the car as our stomachs turned inside out waiting on food. Darkness fell and we finally got our seat. Bowls and plates of food decorated the table. Jim’s fork pursed ear high ready to strike after the waitress removed her arm from aim. We ate like thru-hikers. Like we’d been out for days. Bonnie even whiffed her cobbler down like she had just sat down for her first bite. Good Lord, I’m full. Thank you for this bounty. Now let’s go listen to bluegrass.The yard was full of cars. The pickin room was filled with stringed instruments, wrinkled folks and smoke. Yes this was an old timey jam session if I’d ever seen one. Bonnie recalled memories of her dad and his bluegrass days. We found our corner and turned up some elixir and toasted a fine day. That was the best we could do at this point. We looked at each other, no flattin for us, we’re pooped. We’ll just let these folks pick the night away while we drift off in our thoughts of today’s hike, homeplace, harmony.","Andy Lane-Tinker Cliffs

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/367784,"We were just here not more than two weeks ago, same side trail with some of the same people. However today we have a whole different trip in front of us. We have an old friend back with us, Sandra-Dotson #2 and a storm’s a comin! Slim Jim and I are geared out for an overnight stay at Lamberts Meadow Shelter and the chance of some snow and or rain. Sandra and Bon Bon are going up Andy Lane with us to Tinker Cliffs and then cutting their day a little shy of ours. With the 50 degree temps forecasted today we can hardly believe snow would have a chance. Let the surprises begin...Heading into Exxon at Daleville I notice 6 hikers getting dropped off. I have to ask where they are headed. Hello, surprise #1, Lamberts Meadows tonight. Hummm I think that shelter only holds like 6, 8 max. “Guess we'll be tenting tonight"" Jim says. Well I won't… I didn't pack a tent. On second thought now maybe I should have. I was only thinking of preparing myself for our TN trip when tenting isn't allowed in the Smokies. Not that exceptions aren't allowed but 99% not. So I'm sheltering it so scootch over boys!!! Jim and I leave my rig here for us to hike to tomorrow and we’re off to meet the girls at Andy Lane.Comparing packs before we hit the trail I joke with Sandra that my pack just might weigh in just a tad over her’s today. She’d loaded baby, clothes hanging off her back, protruding like the hunch back of Notre Dame. Django is leashed up and ready as well eager for his day in the woods. Bonnie finds her spot in line and off we go. Questions and concerns already loom of what the future holds. What if it rains? What if it snows? What if the shelter is full? All we can do is hike on and find out. The bottom lands along Tinker Creek aren't near as marshy as I had expected with the rain we have had the last couple of days. Guess the ground soaked it all up and the warmth has helped too. I have my gators already on and am soon out of my long pants and in short sleeves before we hit the gate heading up Andy's Trail. 3 miles to Scorched Earth Gap and it's all up hill, mine as well not sweat it all out just yet. Well no stopping Sandra, she's already fogged up and rosy cheeked. ""Been awhile since you hiked girl?""Jim and I soon hit our pace and tackle the 2 hardest grades without really stopping for a break. We have our trail legs and lungs and feeling strong. Bonnie leads Sandra to the gap hardly believing she has come this far already. Keep hiking with us girl and you'll soon be overnighting too I say. The gap proved to be a gateway of traffic. Hikers coming up behind us heading to McAfee Knob, Hikers coming from McAfee heading to Lamberts and those hiking back down Andy Lane. Wow the nice weather and long weekend have opened the woods up. Hummm wonder how many will be at that shelter now? MY TENT?!Making the last push to Tinker Cliffs Jim and I know this will put our hardest hiking behind us today. The skies are holding clear but hazy now and a nice cool breeze greets us on the cliffs. Air conditioning!! More hikers are met. Us girls get a photo and a hug since this will be their lunch stop and turn around point. Jim and I decide best to hike a little while longer before we eat. Down Down to the gap. Carvins Cove to our left and Catawba Valley to our right. A perfect view, a perfect day. The top of the meadow barn is spotted, we can eat at the picnic table there. I'd been by here last year but didn't check the place out. Wow, a covered porch on the barn with a table under it, fire wood, grills, and 3 milk jugs of clear liquid. Now I assumed it was water but Jim teased it might be white lighting. Shoot we could just camp here I thought. There's a privy too. We could sleep under the porch, build a fire and have all the room we needed. Can you tell I’m still thinking about that spot left for me at the shelter?Jim checks in home while I try to eat my sandwich. I'm not real hungry but know I need to eat for energy. See this morning I had some intestinal disruption to say the least. I wasn't sure if hitting the woods was the right idea but heck I was already packed and Jim was on his way. I could make it...I think. While finishing up lunch a man cuts down the bank coming toward us. He's no hiker, a local. We stay alert. He says he lives just over the hill and out for a stroll. He leaves and I take one last look around and notice some pad locked doors and then a cabled winch like system in one corner of the barn. Holy shit is this where they string up trespassers? Two hooks for two hikers.. let's get out of here...deliverance.   This blue blazed side trail, tinker loop, is a path not hiked much except by hunters I'd say. Hence the deer hoist I just spoke about. It runs along the side of Tinker Mountain below the cliffs by a mile or so. I guestimated we'd be at the shelter in time to 'take a spot' say 2:30 or so. Only hiking this once I recall some turns along the way but only as we come to them. Jim is curious to note that this path is not on the 'regular' trail maps he has researched. No worries Jim, I've been trained by the best adventure hiker I know, The Captain. Just follow me I'll get us back to the AT. I have to say the grade was more than I remembered but was a fairly easy hike and once I saw the little stream we cross I knew we were just moments from our intersection. The white blazes lead up the creek, a picnic table sets in the bottom meadow, here would be the prime camping spot...if only I had my tent. “My tarp will accommodate us if necessary” Jim proclaims. Huh I've seen the tarp, 1 person yes, 2 no way and in the rain??. I'll take my chances on that shelter spot. Wonder if the Exxon boys are there? What about the other hikers we met over the cliffs? 3 of them were coming this way. I see an orange hat, a person. There is someone already up there.We approach the shelter and a small stream of smoke lifts in the air. 1 hiker, then 2 are spotted. I scan the shelter floor, space, YES we are safe, we are in THE INN!! Art from Chattanooga TN and 2 young lads from just over the hill from Lord Botetourt are all that have arrived thus far. We make our introductions. The boys are out of high school and not yet in college mode yet, working and camping along in life. Both sport hunter orange toboggans and remind me of Santa's Helpers. Cheery fellows with loads of laughs. Art is a seasoned section hiker who has completed about 900 miles of the trail and has come this way to knock out the sections from 311 to Daleville. Packed light with a GoLite pack no bigger than a day pack he tells us he hasn't acquired a trail name when I ask for theirs. As the eve goes along we discover he and his wife are quite the adventures and have chosen to donate their bodies to science if something were to happen to them. He's in his early 60's, I asked… didn't want another surprise in the night other than a hiker coming in ya know. He displays a business like card which has the number to call if he were to expire, a real DEATH CARD. Yo man you just got your trail name I say.Laying out our gear Jim has stuff every where. He's brought his super size pack which any average army guy would call his own. Outer frame sucker with pockets galore, hey Sandra did you help him fill this thang? It really wasn't all that heavy but enough for him to be glad he was out of it come camp time. Practice makes perfect. I lay out all my stuff in its own little place for me and unveil my big green monster, my western mountaineer 20 degree bag. An ahhh cames over the shelter. The boys were ready to trade their soles for it. Looking over at their flat mats thickness of card board and slim like sheets for sleeping bags I did feel for them. Even Art was impressed however I'm guessing he'd never carry something so heavy to break the 2 ounce mark per item. I'm sure he and Captain could have spared gear all night. Time passes and still no Exxon boys, wonder if they stopped? I guess when they heard some girl was gonna be here they decided to end their trip. I joked a good thing Noni wasn’t here right now. Santa's Helpers just might get more than they bargained for in the woods. (Remember that quote...I'm an exotic dancer, she professed when asked her profession on one trip?) We take turns stoking what little fire the boys have started and wait for night to fall and whatever else might come from the skies. Still no precip just yet. I noticed two patches of daffodils sprouting up. Spring? I brew up some hot cider and pass around some refreshment while our meals are cooking. A couple comes in for a late lunch or early supper just out for a quick trip up Andy Lane. She was carrying the pack and of course the guys all wanted to know what spell this young man had placed on his lady. Each shares load, she carries on the down, he carries on the up. Pretty good trade off.The sun sets and hiker midnight is upon us. 6:15pm. Who goes to bed at 6:15? We all did. At least in our sleeping bags we laid talking to one another and sharing a laugh over stories. I tried to write in my journal but couldn't concentrate enough to string my thoughts together. The temps haven't fallen much maybe 30s and I'm already very warm in my bag. ""Say guys I'm sweating over here, it's like 104. If you need my down booties ya'll just say so."" The shelter erupts in laughter. ""Give me them damn booties woman""..I turn on my tunes and watch the last of the light go out of the sky.. a few snorts and puffs come from the boys corner...giggle giggle...Light flickers, is that a hiker I say out loud? No one answers in the shelter. Oh no it must be the other hikers coming in. Where will they fit?! I find my glasses to take a better look setting up in my sleeping bag. No one is there. The fire coals are faint. It must have been just a quick breeze that stirred up the flickers of light and fooled me. What time is it anyways? I lay back down.Tossing in my slight sleep I feel the night pains of should I pee or should I hold? Still I wonder what time it is. I look at my watch 7:54, no way, we talked at least that long. I can’t wait any longer besides I better hit the privy this might be more that a quick wet, belly rumbles. I quick step it up the path to the privy walking knock kneed so I don’t trickle down my leg, damn this shit, literally. Waddling up the privy steps my head lamp shines up in the darkness like spot light, the cold throne crisps my cheeks and I blow the door off this place. If there had been pigeons to set lose they surely would have flown.I tuck myself back in bed and check my phone for the time 12:18am. That’s more like it. However it also confirms my watch battery has died. So have all the shelter occupants, not even a rustle.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/367875,"Morning brings the surprise of still yet no snow. The skies are grey white as if it could drop a flake any minute but just doesn’t have the feel to it. The boys have gotten an early 7ish start and are gone while Art is about packed and ready himself. Jim and I are surprisingly the last to leave at 7:45am. Knowing the temps are supposed to fall as the day progresses I am over dressed with my woolies on and winter pants and top. I soon heat up and am ready to shed a layer when a damp breeze catches me and decide best to keep on keeping on. The trail has been rerouted from the many PUDS of these first couple of miles and is quite easy. We are just tucked below the ridge and out of direct winds and the many rocky parts to our left. Sandy sections underfoot and short undergrowth make it feel somewhat open but very ordinary. Jim talks of Pizza Hut and how soon we shall arrive there today. We only ate a trail bar for breakfast. I never cook in the morning any more. Too much trouble and usually cold too. Easier to just get up and get moving. Besides why spoil and good hunger for pizza. We had talked about it last night and wondered if Santa’s Helpers would be there too. Oh the Exxon boys, I about forgot to tell you, they did arrive but stayed down by the creek last night. Two fellows were out when we passed their site this morning. Others still in their tents. Pretty good sized tents too, 3 of them.Big flakes begin to fall. Wetness begins to saturate us so we pull out our rain hats. I don’t even fool with rain gear, it’s not that bad and beside we’ll be off the trail by lunch. I’m still plenty warm too. Jim dawns another piece of snazzy gear, his new rain hat. Quite the fashion statement with grey diamonds etched on a blackish girlie style hat and let’s not forget those wrist warmers too!!!A clearing comes up ahead, a powerline cut, we should be headed for the crest now Jim. Carvins cove is faintly seen to our right, the heavy weather has started to set in the mountains and valley making things dim and washed out. Darker than normal light too seem much later in the day than it really is. Soon we reach Hayrock, we’ve come a good 6 miles only 4 more to go I say. Still not real hungry, we just have a snack and water. Best to keep moving since it doesn’t take long to cool down and the dampness to cut in on our warmth. My feet are beginning to feel it now. Balls of my feet are becoming a tad sore. Jim confers his legs are a bit tired. The last powerline, this is our turn down off the ridge, the last views over Botetourt. Guess the young boys are settled in home by now. I can’t tell what time it is, remember my watch gave out. The snow begins to really stick now and the taste of pizza is growling in our bellies. We reach the kiosk; Jim turns over the lead saying he doesn’t miss our turn out of the woods to the parking lot. Just a mile to go.We have our heads down as the snow begins to stack up on our packs and brims of our hats. One last hill to climb Jim, we are parked just over this knoll. With our adventure coming close to an end we immediately start talking about the TN trip and the what if’s of the Smokies and the weather it may hold. Uncertainty…The AT…the people…the fun…the accomplishment… the surprises…that’s what brings us back!!!","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/368100,"Sarver Holler, one hell of a climb or was that the dreaded climb out of hell? However you look at it, it IS one climb that most never want to do again…especially if one is hung over. Oh no it wasn’t me; it was the Wildman’s turn in the box. I picked up Dustin aka Wildman this morning early so we could meet Captain and Bon Bon at the Craig’s Creek pull off. We are doing a two car drop today so I wanted to get a little jump on parking cars and a good thing cause this day turned out to end a little later than expected. Hitting the trail at 9am we are bound for waling and gnashing of teeth just like the good book says with the ending of time. Sarver holler is not for the weak with a straight ascent up the side of Sinking Creek Mountain, traversing 1.5 miles and elevation gain of 1500 feet. Captain jumps out in the lead to get a head start with Dustin right behind him while BonBon and I are still locking up the car. It’s a beautiful clear day with a nip in the air which will feel good once we start up.Wildman’s big boots clump against the ground like they are heavy as cinder blocks. Man is he gonna have a long day, little did I really know…. The trail cuts into the woods and Captain pulls over for us ladies to keep up our head of steam. My fingers are numb but I know I’ll soon sweat and don’t dare put on gloves. At the first semi switchback off the top layer comes and we hit granny low gear. Bonnie loses a few steps behind me but is still in ear shot. The boys are out of sight. I look to the sky and measure the tree tops for progression. Once I hear the water I know we aren’t far from the old house ruins. The backs of the lower calves burn and I hear Bonnie give out a sigh. “The water is just up ahead girl we are almost there!” I yell out. 9:49am The rock piles appear and the stream flows rather nicely down from the mountain. Two remaining chimneys stand amongst the heavy logs of the home place all of which have fallen in. We drop our packs at the fire ring and take a look around while we wait on the boys. The corn crib is pretty wrecked as well but still has its sides. I know no one will want to check out the cemetery today so I don’t even ask I just point to its location. So we wait….Cooling down us girls have to put back on our jackets. 30 minutes, then 40 minutes and a Hootie Hoot. Before I see them Wildman gives a shout, BLANK BLANK YOU MARTHA!!!! The holler has claimed yet another ticked off hiker. I grin and await more cursing. Captain is ready for a rest so we get him to the shelter which is just up the hill. We can all get a snack there and get the motivation to climb the last ½ to the ridge line. Connecting up with the AT we now have 7.3 miles to go. Its 11:22 and we’ve only come a mile and a half. I had suspected we could all finish about 1:30 but now I recalculate for say 3:30. Time now to see what this newly blazes trail and relocation has in store. The trail used to go over long rock slabs and slanted ridge line. Very hard walking especially in rain or snow. Now looks like we are cutting to the north side of the ridge and avoiding this. I am eager to get moving. Bon and I set our pace and chatter and don’t even realize we have again walked off and left the boys. Wildman said he was watching his feet and looked up and we disappeared. I decide we better stop here and get the truck key from Captain since it is his car we are hiking too. We’ll stop say 12ish and all have lunch together. To our surprise the reroute doesn’t last that long and we’re right back on the slanted rock ledge. 2 miles worth of this can sure wear on your feet especially if you don’t have good fitting shoes. I’ve gotten many a blister from this mountain but today my feet feel light as a feather. Sure hope Dustin’s feet hold out.I see a nice grassy spot with a downed log we can all set on for lunch and tell Bonnie to stop here. We shouldn’t be that far ahead of them at this point. 12:10pm. Turns out we weren’t they arrive in about 15 minutes. Trail talk of wooing wild women and crazy nights bring us to rolling laughter. The Captain quizzes us on our surroundings, where is McAfee Martha? Where is Audie Murphy? I see Peaks of Otter and Tinker Cliffs. North is that way. Now that we know our directions and are fortified lets make some tracks. Hell it’s gonna be dark when we get off of here, little did I know….See ya at the car boys, don’t you worry Dustin we won’t drink all your beer, I’ll have a big orange waiting on you Captain. Bouncing along we hop skip across the rocks loving this wonderful day. Bonnie and I both are ready for a change of terrain. Give me the woods, the pine needle trail, the leaves. Rocks rocks rocks. Look the Eastern Continental Divide sign, Bonnie. 1920 miles to Gulf of Mexico and then right 405 miles to the Atlantic Ocean. Let’s hike to the ocean then, its closer. The sign is our sign the rocks are over. The AT turns off the ridge and we can hike on some ‘normal’ ground. 3 ½ miles to go. We met some trail crew works this morning in the parking lot and have now come into their work zone seeing lopped off limbs, cut briars, and cleared blow downs. Thank you, Thank you. We hear them working just ahead. 3 fellows working up quite the sweat. More are down by the shelter they say. We make quick work of this section and soon we hear the road traffic our car is just around this next bend I say.I check the register box just as the trail comes out to the parking lot. Warren Doyle has signed in saying he’s headed to Blacksburg for the night and for anyone to call him for entertainment. I really wonder if it was him?? SOBO’s had signed in at Sarver just this month too. Time for me and Bonnie to sign out. HA3:30pm We kick off our trail shoes and settle in for a snack and drinks knowing our boys will be at least 30 to 40 minutes behind us. More and more hikers come out of the woods and each car parked here begins to leave. The trail workers have all come out as well. The lead worker was going to tell Captain when we pasted them so they would know how far long they are but the boys hadn’t reached them on their departure. The sun weakens behind the woods sinking lower in the sky. The holler is getting cold and dark. 4:30pm“Should we go back looking for them?” Bonnie says. Or should we start drinking Wildmans’s beer? “I’m not gonna get too worried till 5:00 surely they’ll be out by then” I mutter. Tapping our watches and meandering around we anxiously look up the trail.YeeAwwaaa!!! echoes from the forest. Wildman gives a big Wildman holler. “I’m coming ladies, I’m home free”. A faint Hootie Hootie comes from the Captain. Thank God our boys are ok, they have arrived. Dustin can’t get out of his boots quick enough and Captain is ready to collapse on the back of his truck. His big orange vanishes with a cold soda headache. “Where’s my beer?” Dustin exclaims. Bonnie and I look at one another sheepishly, Don’t know?” We just hid it really. Sure glad you didn’t need to bring out the head lamps boys. We had our long johns on ladies. We had our night clothes. HA Glad to see everyone safe we load the tired bodies in the car for the drive home, a drive home in the sunset.","Sarver Holler

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/369240,"Can anyone be a Thru Hiker? Well of course I’d say. All you need is some trail time, some gear and a few planning stages. It’s that simple; you put a pack on and just go. The only thing left to do is just finish or well be finished or THROUGH. Isn’t that right L-Train?Today I have taken the L-Train to Angels Rest and the plan is to walk to that power line and back. Its 8 miles just ask Bonnie. He seems up for it. Besides there will be a trip to the New River Grill after so why not?! We arrive to the trail head and are the only ones to park. It’s a nice day with a cool holler feel as usual on this north side of the mountain. Walking up the fairly new lain rock steps I recall Yukon Charlie’s work detail here. This was one of his last visits to the trail to finish his maintenance on this section. As you know we lost him to illness last year I believe. Soon Larry asks if we are half way to the top yet. Not even close. We should be to the fire road shortly and that is half way. Not pleased he puts his head down and pants onward. I know he is thinking he could still be sleeping right now but instead he is banking up some bonus points with the wife, Lead Dog.Reaching the fire road a sense of accomplishment is felt and a smile breaks on Larry’s face. If he only remembered what is up head. Hope he doesn’t or I might be walking by myself from here. Some steep coming L-Train I’ll see ya at the rest.Looking out over my left the New River flows green. It’s the most colorful I’ve ever seen the river. The smoke from Celanese drifts thru the air. The trail twists steeper running into the rhododendron thickets. A mossy lined trail peaceful quite. Just me and the woods. Reaching the Angels Rest junction sign I climb on a rock for a set down and wait for the train to arrive. Mudder, Smackin, Flippin, Siggghhh. I hear him coming. It’s amazing in the stillness what sounds will travel up or down from a ridge. Making his last turn before in sight he lets out a line of dissatisfactions. “Hootie Hootie, you’re almost here baby!” His eyes could have cut me into. Then I hear a sound from the other direction…It’s a thru hiker, our first spotted this year. He and Larry come up and around to where I am for introductions. I start my usual line of what is your name, where are you from, when did you start, where are you going today? The Professor was his trail name, from NJ, finished school, worked construction while working on his masters, hit the trail Feb 1st and was going into Pearisburg for Mexican Food and shoe Goo. He stayed at Woods Hole last night. He mentioned how being the first at hostels provided him with warm welcomes and excited hosts. Unlike say those hikers coming later in the season when the hostels are running over with guests and the owners are warn out and loosing their patients. Larry introduced himself as being a thru-hiker as well. Just in a different sense of the word. “You are thru and I am through, finished, done” We all had a big laugh. We gave him some pointers of things in town and to be sure to stop in to see the Captain. He had heard of the zip line and plans to do just that. Pressing on to Wilburn Ridge Larry is quick to volunteer “his trail magic”. “I could turn around right now and catch him, I could take him to town and Wal-Mart, and and….” Keep walking L-Train you are loosing bonus points bud! The overlook was dead calm with silence. No wind. Just warmth of the sun. A hawk drifts by. There’s route 100, the way we drove in on. I have a snack while Larry’s mind is still spinning its web to get out of this journey. Trekking on we are bound for that power line. Ridge walking and I’m ready to air it out so to speak. The only airing I hear from behind me is truly Larry’s behind. Wew glad he is down wind. Cracking off like he is in some competition with the boys. His pace slows.Passing my two known land marks, two lone rhododendron bushes, I calculate we are about a mile from the lines. A nice big tree is laid out just waiting for us to have lunch on so I give Larry a break and ask if he’d like to call it quits here. In his astonishment he can hardly say yes and nods his head like a bobble head doll. Lunch was relaxing and just enough to tide us over till the grill’s burgers. A new lift has come to the L-Train’s step quickening our return back across the ridge to the overlook. Hardly seemed like an hour had passed. Making our way to the switchbacks we started to meet a few more hikers coming in for the day. Was good to see more folks on the trail. Yes a great day to be out weather for a thru-hike or just trying to get through.","Rt. 634 to Angels Rest

Gommer’s famous call out whenever something happened to catch him off guard. This day was full of them.I pulled up the road to the Rice Fields parking spot which holds just a few cars and it was already getting full. The closer to got I realized my scheduled hikers where each there lined up leaving me a spot to pull in front. What’s this? The Straggler? Good ol Harry has blown into town and surprised us. We also had back our trail named Johnny Knobknocker, aka The Sandman too. Bon Bon and The Captain and me round out the 5. Sandman lives up to his name and has his 35 pound weighted vest strapped on and is in the process of tangling up his arms trying to get his regular pack on over it. It holds like 5 one liter Gatorades to round out his load. I myself have my overnight pack to get that extra workout in preparation for our TN hike coming up second week of April. I weigh in at 24 pounds. Pack that is; my arss weighs that much on one side. HACaptain scampers out in front to get an extra jump on us hoping to reach the top of that first hill before we can catch him. Leading my group we come up on him midway thru the switchbacks. He has done well. We all catch our breath at the top of Hickock Knob and disperse out. The fog is burning off gradually and we just might have a view on top today. Grey skies lend to a chance of showers any minute but so far they are on hold. Time to grab granny gear and dig in for the next 2 miles cause its all up. My legs feel the extra weight of my pack Lord only knows what Sandman is going through. I stop to check everyone’s status and if anyone wants to take the lead. Harry looks at me like I have 2 heads and 17 eyes. Sandman seconds that and everyone says a stern NO. The pace is apparently at their limits. I smile inside and know I am doing my job then.Lichen covered rocks brighten the inter slopes of the mountain as the trail passes over then. A nice touch of green to add to this St. Patrick’s day weekend. Harry adds, ‘when did Devils Marbleyard move to Peters Mountain?’ Yes the rocks were plentiful and slowed our strides to maintain our safety. Captain comes along behind us listening to his radio marching to his own beat. He counts off the false turns which lead you to believe you are at the sharp right turn of the mountain crest. A total of 4 he tells me later was the tally. My trail landmarks are the water source and then THAT TREE. You know the one that looks like..well…the profile of a naked old dude from the waste down. You catch my drift? Right? Once at this tree you are at the ridge and a nice place for a break.Lined up we set down on a fallen big oak tree which has been here as long as I can remember. Sandman tries to give away those Gatorades but no takers on a full bottle only sippers looking to hand him back his load. Me being one of them. Layers come off to cool down and snacks go in to refuel our bodies. Still no Captain. We shall wait on him at the shelter. Three miles to then along this ridge.Spring has sprung in the valley’s making their patches of farm land vibrant with color. I do love this time of year. Tree buds are popping too. Wild flowers aren’t quite up just yet. Still a touch of fog resting over the water ways of the New River and Bluestone I think Harry called it. West Virginia we see you.Chatting along we reach the stile of the Rice Fields and can hardly believe we are already here, 11:05. A Sherpa cart lies beside the fence. I’m guessing a hunter has left it here to haul out his deer when he shoots it. Strange though it being here. Say who wants a ride off the mountain? All hands go up. Looking out from the fields we sense how peaceful it is. The wind is nil and we have some warmth from the sun trying to peek through the thick clouds. Still no rain. We decide to check out the shelter log and kill a little time while the Captain arrives and we’ll have lunch together. A hiker did stay here last night and was looking forward to some dry weather. Guess his boots where wet and he tried to dry them because there were 20 sheets of notebook paper crunched up in a pile left behind. At least the next guy could do the same. We also read about to hikers we met last November in partnership shelter, T-Bone and Biscuit. They are back out, T-bone finishing up his section he missed on this SOBO hike of 2011, Biscuit back out to hike NOBO yet another time. Hope we see them again. What’s that moving behind the shelter? I spot a glimpse of ….of…the Captain. He has tried to sneak up on us. I have blown his cover. Hey old man, 11:39, that aint bad. We high five. SURPRISE The Captain is back. He is quite proud of himself I can see it in his eyes. Having lunch John digs down in his pack and pulls out his own surprise, a black dried up piece of looking shoe leather. Heck it’s a banana hid since his hike to Kilimanjaro from last September. Wow they really don’t break down do they? A rumble comes up behind us. It’s it thunder? Sounds like a stampede, you know like cattle moving through a field. I know they do graze up here but have never seen them. Horses! It’s a team of 5 horseman out for a ride. Hummm, where did they come from? Where are they going? Aren’t they not allowed on the AT? Quick, answer the Captain’s Trivia Question…Where on the AT ARE horse allowed? The Smokies in TN and The Creeper Trail in Damascus, the AT runs in conjunction with it. Riding on up the trail they cross over into the next ridge and disappear north. Walking back we tried to follow the hoof marks and see where they had come onto the trail and figure it had to be up a powerline cut. Two Gatorades lighter John pulls on his load and readies himself for the 5 miles off of here. My load feels lighter too. Feeling good. Bonnie jumps behind me then John we are out-a-here. We gotta get John off of here so he can go play basketball. WHAT? Are you kidding me? Harry and The Captain match up for a more leisurely outing. Rain starts to spit on us, feels nice, and dries about as quick as it hits. The trail on the other hand turns tricky in those rock sections. Sure hope no one falls. The showers come and go and before we know it we hit a flat spot and it sure feels good. All the down has taken a toll on our legs and knees. A hiker comes into the woods. Section hiker from New York, G-Man, retired garbage truck guy that got his trail name from his kids. He is out for 5 weeks finishing what he can between here and Erwin TN. Hikers are coming out now and will continue to thicken the trail. Can’t wait to meet more.Resting at the truck Bonnie and I kick back and enjoy a cold drink while John gets him a sip and hobbles off to his truck to make that basketball game. Good luck Sandman. 2:30.We guess our other boys should be along with in the hour and concede our time well spent. And well spent it was….3:10ish I hear them chatting and emerge from the woods. Smiling and looking quite well after not hiking regularly Harry enlightens us on the finer things of life. Like hiking with Captain and getting to know hikers. “There’s more to the trail than just clicking along with that clock”. “We get to know people” You are right Harry, right as rain. Yes, Nothing like the surprises of this day, this trail and the trail with friends.","Rt. 641

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/370777,"Neither hail or pain nor driving rain shall keep us from the trail. Are we insane? I’m sure there are some who would say so but The Captain and I think not. Besides we weren’t the only fools in the woods today.Meeting at the pull off parking at the junction of Rt. 100 and 42 I had already decided we should cut our hike shorter than scheduled. From 14 down to 10 miles would be more than enough to get a good hikers work out in. Besides it’s gonna rain ya know!!!It had rained off and on all night and the trail was already saturated. We put on our rain gear and pack covers as soon as we got out of the truck. Parking at the end of Dismal road before it cuts up the mountain would give us the early climb up the Ribble trail, the old AT route, and hopefully put us on top between rain storms. My rain gear consisted of my newest rain jacket and golite rain pants. Light as a feather they are and kept me bone dry. Then I put a pack cover on my pack, same one from Osprey. Captain elected to go with his packa, a rain jacket, pack cover combo, which I also have and wished now I had on later. It comes with a sewn in hood and ‘skirt’ covering your legs just above the knee. Knees bare mind you, no rain pants for The Captain on his climb up. AND yes it begins to rain steady.Leaves are thick in the trail washed full from previous storms. Squish Squish Soggy Soggy the trail turns more inclined with each step. Reaching the first forest road where the Sandman met his waterloo the Captain gets a seat on a tree stump. His stamina is improving but a rest every now and again is called for along with his new trail snack, Reese pieces. If you were to have followed us you could have just tracked us by the little droppings of yellow and orange candies. The rain picks up and soon my pack cover has formed a nice little sack of water hanging from the bottom. Captain points it out and we dump it like a pan of water. Guess since my pack isn’t really full the extra material just sagged and gathered water. Not good. However all things in pack stayed dry the bottom was quite soaked, glad my tent was the only thing I stored there. Yes I carried my full pack today for training. Weighed about 20 pounds, felt good.Captain’s packa worked well in the rain which has now turned to gusts blowing sideways on occasion. Sure glad the temps are up today, 50 I’d say. His only draw back was trying to get to his water conveniently. The packa was a little difficult to get under to it so I just lifted the Captain’s skirt to assist. Humm sure hope the kilt isn’t coming to TN. With these two pieces of gear together might get another Marline Monroe shot!!! The cabin should be up ahead letting up know the top has been reached. Steeper climb now and I must wait a little on my hiking buddy to catch me. I see a pile of boards and the dismantled privy. The picnic table has even sunk in the ground. Guess whoever owns this decided time to clean the property. The AT is just around the corner and so is a brighter day.Wow how can the weather change? Walking the ridge a lighter skies try to come over. The trail becomes more inviting with a grassy lined path leading us. We chat about our upcoming trip and hope the warmer weather we’ve been having follows us to TN but these rains can go away. Then I notice movement, its three hikers coming our way, more fools on the trail. Ha Gals from Charlottesville out completing a section from before Wapiti and heading for Pearisburg. They are wrapped up but look thrilled to be out here and say they will be hiking the same section in TN we are but northbound. We tell them Woods Holes is just a few miles back and a good place to dry out but they seemed bound for Docs Knob shelter. Our day continues to lighten with blue skies surrounding us and Captain strips from this rain gear. I decide to let mine dry on me and will shed at the overlook now we can see from it for lunch. I feel pep in our step with this spring sunshine upon us. Setting on the overlook rock I stretch out my rain stuff to dry. The heavy fog still socks in this side of the mountain no views to Pearisburg today but we have sun on our shoulders and food in our bellies. Life is good. Hope we can make it back to the car now before the next wave of weather hits. We don’t tarry long. Calculating we’ve come over half way we should be out in 4.5 miles. Our next land mark will be Wapiti shelter. Lots of down from here Captain, I will see you at the foot of the mountain. He puts his head phones in and I bop on down the trail. Ah it feels good to stretch out the legs. The down isn’t near as bad as I remembered. My pack rides nicely and soon I reach the turn and will be at shelter before long. I hear the storms gathering afar. Rumbles of thunder. I dare not wait too long before putting on rain gear and elect to at least put the pack cover on again, too warm of other items. Captain catches me at the stop and takes out the ear phones for me to warn him of what might be coming. We’ll be lucky to get out without getting wet again he says. I’ll wait on you at the shelter turn old man.The trail seemed to draw us closer to the brewing storms. Bright above us, black in front of us. A tunnel of rhodies gave me the feel of protection but didn’t let me see what I might be walking into either. Peeking out every now and again only gave me a fright and made me walk quicker. Waiting at the Shelter junction I put on all my rain gear again in preparation of what’s ahead. Captain approaches in about 15 minutes. Has his packa on too. Bring it on we say we are ready, we won’t melt.A flat trail open trail gave us all the perspective we needed access whatever might be coming. Darker and darker it became. The wind picks up, it won’t be long. The skies groan and moan. Hurry Captain if we can just make it to the Ribble junction we’ll only have a mile to go. We’ll have it licked no matter what comes. So I thought…Just when I crest the last little knoll clueing me the ribble is up head IT COMES. The rain so thick I can hardly see. White marks show up but the blue marks no way. I must go by instinct. Then HAIL. Yes hail not Hell. Well I did say holy hell. I turn at the junction and hunker under a big pine tree waiting on Captain. I hope I can see him. His orange hat will surely show up. There he is I holler out. I can hardly hear myself the hail is so loud.“My hands my hands!!” Captain shouts. The hail cuts at us. Bouncing off our heads like marbles. Damn hope they don’t get golf ball size. LET’S GO!!! The trail is a swamp. Slick with ice balls. I look closely for blue blazes, good I got them. I know a left turn is approaching going up the hill. I can’t afford to miss it. I check for Captain over my shoulder. Making the turn I raise my sticks to alert him turn here. I wait below seeing him tredge along coming closer to our junction. “Wait Captain, Turn here, Hey!!! I whistle as loud as I can. He looks but doesn’t see me but knows he must turn someplace. Then he realizes. Wow that would have been bad. To miss this turn you head back up the mountain for another loop, no way. By now the trail is a creek. The hail has stripped all pine needles the ground. It smells like Christmas. Letting up we are now drenched and really don’t care to dodge even the biggest of water crossings. Wading on thru we go, water up to our knees. The car is only a 100 yards ahead. Emerging from the creek bank Captain throws up his arms and sticks…“I made it!!” Yes we made it Captain. It was a Hail of Hike.","Dismal Falls Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/373600,"Where to start, my mind runs rampid. We tamed the tail of the Dragon, we fought the winds of the Smokies, and we hiked long miles and some hiked long long days. We met many thru hikers and of course some section hikers like us. We also acquired a list of thru hiker quotes which I will try to recall back to you. My favorite “it’s not about the miles but about the smiles!” So here we go….We left out early Monday morning to drop a car at Fontana Dam. I had called early on to make sure this was still ok and yep just pick a spot. Captain and I met Jim along the interstate and we caravanned down to NOC for a quick lunch and then parked Captain’s FJ at the Dam. Here’s where taming the dragon comes in. Now you guys know Miss Maatha ain’t good on a mountainess curvy road. US 129 is THE TAIL OF THE DRAGON. Thank God Jim was driving. This damn road has 300 some curves over an 11 miles stretch. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? When he told me this I just sank in my seat. I called shotgun right off and asked for a cold drink before the ride began. Buckle up all passengers. Heads clear and seat buckles secure let the roller coaster begin. Motorcycles zipped by and little sports cars tried to straighten every curve with Captain giving approval for each racing engine. Easy Jim. Take it slow for me or I’ll spew. And he did. I made it out alive and couldn’t wait to get checked in to our hotel.We stayed at the Grand Prix Motel in Gatlinburg which is a hikers dream. Cheap room split 3 ways at $12 bucks, shower and kitchenette. There’s a pool too but not quite ready this time of year. We quickly made friends and met the management, talked hiker trash and passed along trail news. All you need is some mistletoe and story to attract a crowd. As one white headed hiker quoted, “I never knew I’d find myself lusting after white haired women.” Let the stories build.After a good diner at Jose’s we hit the bed for an early start tomorrow.","Grand Prix Motel

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/373618,"Yikes it’s cold at the Gap. I had Jim leave off the heat in the car coming up the mountain. Stepping out I was ready to rock-n-roll. Let’s make tracks boy. A quick photo by the sign and we darted in the woods. 10.8 miles lies ahead of us today. It is clear but very windy. My legs turn red quick as the blood runs to keep warm. Wish I’d put my gloves on to start. Rocks and roots hinder our stride but hey that’s the Smokies. The grade will be all up today basically and we should warm soon enough.Captain is bringing up the rear and keeping up nicely only behind us by about 15 minutes. He is getting faster and stronger but I know this trip will be a big test for him. His first time out for multiple days since his knew blew out in Maine. Go Captain Go!!! We plan to regroup at set spots along the way so as not to get to far spread out. First stop Mt. Collins Shelter. We already have views out towards Fontana lake out destination in 4 days. It looks quite the distance away. Waiting at the shelter junction it doesn’t take long to cool down. The wind has a bite and the clouds are thickening. Don’t leave sun!! Two long legged fellows come out from the shelter path. Wow 7 footers, Hey guys the basketball team is in town. Their hiking poles were as tall as me. They say they are heading to Double Spring and shall see us tonight. All other hikers to this point are heading north and town. Some even running, yes running wild boys, skipping along rocks and roots with out a care of a wipe out. Spring is starting here in the Smokies. Trout lilies spot our path lined with green green grass. Jim notices some unusual insect catchers. We assume that what they are maybe for wooly an fids. We just called them smokie mountain hummingbird feeders. There were also different stile crossings too. This one section was noted for Hog Invasion. They rooted and rutted quite a mess and fences were put in place to stop their advancement hence a metal stile for us to cross in two places. Closing in on Clingmans Dome the weather turns much colder, splitting sleet. WHAT? Thought today was gonna be sunny and cold. Now it is winter time and looking like a storm is all around us. I’ve been up in the tower and know that is no place for lunch on a warm day. We had talked about eating in the bathrooms but they are on the other side of the side trail to the dome and we aren’t gonna go extra for that. So we decided to hunker down behind a retaining wall leading up from the base. It will provide wind protection. Hope Captain comes along soon as we can’t stay here for long with out moving. We will freeze. I put on my layers and rain gear for wind protection and eat with my gloves on. Jim stammers around hanging his wet first layer out the dry. Shoot man put that over your dry shirt and it will dry under your down coat. Nope it flies from tree to tree between wind gusts. I have to laugh. Folks are coming up from the parking lot and are dressed for town and soon quick step it off the tower and retreat for the warmth of their car. Hey there’s the long legged guys, wearing short shorts like runners and wool hats. They ask if concessions are at the parking area and we never see them again. They did not arrive at the shelter later. We wait for about hour for the Captain but it just got too cold. I leave a note on the sign that we will see him at the shelter and have water and a spot for him laid out in the shelter. In later conversation we find out we only miss him by 10 minutes. He was froze too putting on warmer clothes at this stop and moving along as fast as he can to stay warm.I’ll tell you the dome has quite the view but as cold as it was you just take a quick circle and read the plaques. I saw Fontana and really that’s all I needed to do. Hey young man; take our picture and let’s get out of here.Once we crested the highest elevation on the AT 6,643 it was all done hill to our nights stop. Thick grass built up along the trench of the trail keeping us in it’s path. Hikers one by one trudged up the front side (our back side) of Clingmans. They say going north is harder and by their faces I’d say so. Most spoke but some just grunted and moved on. Oh I forgot to tell you about the crematory tag we found. Coming almost to the crest of Clingmans we noticed a silver flicker on the side of the trail. When I picked it up it was a tag marked Sarasota FL crematory and then I noticed the white ash I just put my fingers in. Guess a hiking sole was placed to rest here. Sorry I have disturbed your bed sir. Just about an hour from our destination the sun popped out and we could shed the last of our layers. I’m still not in short sleeve though!!! I smell smoke the shelter has to be close. An open area, the shelter, how inviting. Now this is what I’ve been waiting for. All the shelters in the park for the AT are 3 sided rock structures with an opening for entering. This large opening running the length of the shelter is covered with a big tarp. Thank you park rangers. There is a fireplace inside and with the tarp we can at least capture some of the heat. Problem here is finding enough wood to stoke the fire. Most shelter areas are picked cleaned. Jim and I are quick to get our bunk spots and Captain’s between us. A gal Kellen is already here working on the fire, 3:20. Another hiker comes in Bahala Na, name meaning Happen What May. He has been thru many surgeries from his cancer, hip and shoulder replacement and a brain tumor removed. We share a camp beverage together and talk of our back grounds. Jim joins in a conversation with our newest arrivals all the way from Israel. The 3 Ts, Tomas, Tom and Tim. They share some of their countries food, a bread stuffed with oils, spices and olives and meats. Oh it was so rich and good. The sun drops a little lower in the skies and we tell our new friends our Captain is soon to be coming in. We look out from our supper seats and hear a faint Hootie Hoot. His hat bops up and down between the trees and then he comes in plain sight. Down to his shorts and trail shirt stepping it off like a thru hiker. The shelter erupts with clapping like the president just entered the room. I cheer, CAPTAIN, CAPTAIN. It was good to have him in before dark. WEW!!!Supper pots boil and hiker aroma fills the air. We don’t set out long and soon gather to our bunks and places for fire warmth. Packs hang the inside roof line. The shelter is full. Captain fills us in on his day and we confer, damn cold. The wind still howls. He has already decided to get up with the chickens in the morning getting a jump on the long day tomorrow. 4am is when his roster will crow and Jim elects to go too unbeknown to Captain. Kellen told Jim of a rock ledge that might be tricky in the dark and someone should accompany another. Besides there is safety in numbers. I will get up about 6:30 I think to myself and catch them. A challenge I fancy.","Newfound Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/373745,"3:25AMThe Captain is up and packing his gear for a long and arduous journey. We have 16.4 miles to complete to reach our next designated shelter. The Smokies requires non-thru hikers to register prior to hiking their planned trip. So the shelters I had originally planned to stop at along our way were already full and we have this longest day ahead passing 3 shelters before our relegated stay at Russell Field. Now we all know if tough becomes rough and worse comes to worse one can just hold up short if they have to and that is what Captain plans to do. He has his tent and extra food and warm clothes. He can stealth camp (hide in the woods undetected to avoid a stiff fine of up to $5000) or stop at say Spence Field trekking 14 miles. The plan for Jim and I is to wait at Russell Field shelter if he doesn’t arrive tonight and wait for him the next day however long that may be. Red light glows in our corner of the shelter as Captain readies himself. Jim arises and informs he is going too. ‘Get back in the bed’ I hear Captain Say gruffly as not needing a hand to hold on this morning trek. Jim is stead fast in his decision and packs to leave as well. I hear their sticks click against the trail till out of sound. I drop back off to sleep.5:30AMNature Calls…it always does for me about this time. Now to just hang on till 6:30. It will be a bit warmer and lighter then. The moon shines almost full and no head lamp needed. The wind howled last night blowing the tarp ends as if someone was coming in and out of the shelter every few minutes. Not even a mouse scurried about, just too damn cold for them. I slept pretty good my hips only waking me with an ache close to morning. Moonlight guides me to the privy. Nice to have a place to set this cold break of day..I think~ A blue hue rests over the shelter as I return to pack for my challenge hike. I hope to catch the boys by 9am. They will have been hiking for 5 hours at that time and should have a pretty good start on the day. Following the white blazes I take very careful note not to miss a one. Usually I don’t even think about it but alone your senses are more intense and with this cold 20 degree morning I sure don’t want to be heading the wrong way at any point. Light pops over the ridges as the sun starts to fill the sky. Peaceful. Fibrant. Connection to earth. This is what I dream about. Flowers line the path once more and I see Fontana Lake in the distance. We are following her once again. A tune comes in my head then I sing aloud to the song of Beatles…It’s a hard days hike, I’ve been hiking all alone, It’s a hard days hike, I’ll catch them before long….Passing Silers Bald Shelter a few people are stirring. Smoke comes from their fire. I wonder if the boys stopped to warm themselves here? Come to find out they did and not a sole knew they came in before dawn. Descending to a gap I notice a note posted on a tree. Martha 7:30. It is 8:30 now they can’t be far. I have to stop to shed my fleece and wool hat. The sun is full but a wind still gusts cold every now and again. I know there is big up, 1 of many for the day, then I turn the corner and there they are. Captain has taken a break on a log and Jim is just above him half way up this second grade. “Holy shit what a pull I shout. How the heck are you boys?” 9AM, I have caught them. They agree today is gonna be a doozie and it’s all about putting one foot in front of the other. Jim is ready to stretch his legs now that I have arrived and Captain is ready to hike his hike. You young bucks go on along he orders. I’ll be there when you see me. From this point each hill gets a little hard and the day a little longer. I think, if this is hard on us, how it must be for the Captain. All the while Captain is thinking, if Denny can hike this with some 60 pounds on his back so can I. (Note our friends Denny and Noni did this same stretch years back, loaded for bear and heart stricken, they made it) The Captain will too!!!First Briar Knob then some no named mountain which Jim declares is Liam Neison because it just kicked our ass. Chuck Norris is more like it. The climbs never end for hours. Thunderhead is supposed to be up here and every time I think we are at the top yet another blaze continues on upward. I quit shouting out we are at the top as it only turns out to be a lie and Jim is ready to crack me with his sticks. We pass many hikers now coming north and off the ridges. They say only a few more miles or a few more turns or a few more switch backs. They all lie too. It never ends. Putting my head down I grit my teeth, ‘this mountain is mine I will conquer you, I will not stop’. Then Jim yells out I’m stopping damit, my legs gotta rest. I press on feeling my strength heighten. What pack? I have no pack on my back. Then I hear voices a group of gals are at the summit with their leader. A sign marks our accomplishment 5527 feet Thunderhead Mtn. Bushes obstruct this spots view but a hiker has told us just over the top a nice grassy opening awaits. I can’t hike fast enough to crash in it. Views vast and mountains so many mountains. Thick field grass clumps surround my body as I stretch out and collapse. Jim’s legs twitch with fatigue and he covers his eyes for a nap. He is zonked from the 4am departure. Wonder where the Captain is about now? Eating my lunch other hikers pass and tell us what is ahead and we the same for them. They have had their own battle coming from the opposite direction. Rocky Top is there and Spence Field is here they point. It is nice to be able to spot them in the distance and calculate how far we have left to go. Good ol Rocky Top… Hell no they can’t grow no corn on Rocky Top and Strangers ain’t never come down from Rocky Top, they are too darn tired. Dirt’s to rocky by far. Good ol Rocky TopI did soak up the 360 degree view and wished Jim could have enjoyed this summit at much as I. His day was dragging and the thought of arriving at Russell Field pulled him. His humor was even gone. Dead man dead. The quietest I’ve ever heard him be. Down we go back towards Spence Field and notice if we had to stealth camp this would be the place. Orchard trees bloomed with little nooks of underbrush for hiding. Nettles tall to cover a small tent from few. Maybe Captain will see this and if need be pull up here if he can’t make Spence Shelter, just 2 more miles ahead. Spence Field gave us reason to cheer, only 3 more miles. We can get there in an hour and 20 minutes we presume. We’ll push and make it. Jim is out of water and there’s no persuading him to pop off the 0.2 miles to Spence Fields water source. I do have some left and share along the way. We pass a few hikers bound for Spence Field as them to pass along our messages to Captain. I left him a motivational note on the shelter junction sign telling him if he has made it this far he’s one hardcore hiker and we will wait for him at Russell in the morning. The gals and leader at Thunderhead are staying there tonight too and have our message as well.Arriving at Russell Field was such relief. It was coming on 4:30 and early enough for us to pick our bunk spots. A father and kids of 3 are already here milling around. He has his hands full with ages from about 11 to 5 I think. Graham, the least and most defying, makes his own rules and marches to his own drum. The girls help their dad with camp chores and play games. Taking a nap is all Jim has on his mind and I myself am ready for a stretch out. Late afternoon now and the shelter is really starting to fill up. By 8:00pm most had arrived with one last sole coming in after dark. We have made a few friends and shared gear and food. PP aka Pink Panther cooked beside me outside and ended up bunking beside me as well. A very tall lean older gent that has been supported by his girl friend slack packing him up until the Smokies. She will meet him at Newfound Gap. He carries little and most of it is very outdated and heavy I’d say. Dressed in jeans and mostly cotton he was a true fire starter and kept it going until bed time. Hiking in tube socks and slip on loafers I don’t know how he was doing it. His bed thin sleeping bag-of cotton-only an inch or so thick. I felt guilty rolling in my green monster bag and having to come out of a layer because I was too warm. Not hot just warm. Jim has his rhythm back now and chatters away with the fellows. They compare gear and talk guy stuff. I wrap up my writing for the night taking in one last look down the trail for the Captain. I know he will not be arriving tonight and hope he is warm and safe. My pen drags on the paper too cold to spread any more ink…..","Double Springs Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/373932,"Early AMWell I was still the first one up this morning but not for hiking. Yep you guessed it Nature BABY. No privy to visit today just a hill side opposite the water source. I have a big tree already picked out for fertilizing. No wind rushing over my bum is nice for once.The shelter begins to rustle with stuff sacks getting stuffed and the sound of air rushing out of a sleeping pads. “No turning back now” a hiker chuckles. Cook pots boil and nourishment consumed. Jim and I peek out of our bags still staying cozy while waiting on the Captain to arrive. PP is working on his morning fire gathering up scraps of wood from the night before. Soon he has it going holding his feet up over it. Socks wrapped with ace bandages to give his arches support in his “trail shoes”. 8:41AMHere I set out front of the shelter watching the last of the hikers leave. Have had my breakfast in the sunshine and not dresses in everything that I own to be outside. Jim and I have sent word to the Captain with the NOBOs. They will pass him as he approaches us. Like an anxious dog waiting on his master we glare down the path. Just the kids and dad to leave out and us. 9:00AMI see him, Hootie Damn Hoot. For the second time in 3 days Captain is greeted be cheering and clapping from a shelter audience. The kids shout ‘The Captain is here!’He looks well and fairly rested. We reload his water as he takes a break and we finish our packing up. He arrived at Spence Shelter at 7:15 before dark. The thru-hikers made room for him on the top bunk while the girls along the bottom whispered in hopes this long haired freaky person didn’t nestle next to them. He won’t bite ladies at least not so it will hurt. HAEating a trail bar in his sleeping bag he went straight to sleep and here he is after a very hard and trying day. Good to have him with us on this semi short day.We are to hike 7.9 miles to a camping site area that once was a shelter. Captain’s day will be more like 11 miles with his 3 miles this morning. It is a good day for a hike, warmer and NO WIND. Still cool but feels like air condition on the hills we climb. Much tamer hills too with the Devils Tator Patch being our highest today at 4775 feet in elevation. We plan to have lunch at Mollies Ridge Shelter close to half way. Just before leaving we notice an extra bag left behind. Oh no it’s Pink Panthers food sack. Holy shit he will be without for 2 days until he reaching Newfound Gap. We try to convince another NOBO that has just arrived to take on in his journey in hopes they might catch one another or if PP turns back, which we really doubt he will. No dice this NOBO declines and carries on in his hike. We leave a note and continue south.Having Captain back in our pack sure is nice. His trail talk is always a pleasure and a laugh. We begin passing more hikers coming from Mollies Ridge. They are pretty loaded down as having resupplied in Fontana the day before. The trail is much easier today and I easily trek up the puds. Cresting Devils Tator Patch a fellow and friend stop to talk with us. He asks the normal hiker questions, where did you stay last night, where are you headed, how many days you been out. Then he asked the BIG question….May I see your…..not that….registration slip? RIDGERUNNER. I did notice his lighter than most pack and his walkie talkie on his hip. Dead give away, you ain’t no ordinary hiker. Very nicely he asked for my identification and I complied. When he asked how many in our group I said 3 and that Captain was just behind us. Now remember the Captain didn’t stay at Russell he stayed at Spence, VIOLATION. I didn’t tell Carl the Ridgerunner that and was hoping he didn’t ask the Captain. Comes to find out they do meet and the same questions fly but nothing comes of it. We trek on.Finally out of my long sleeves and down to shorts since leaving Gatlinburg it’s feeling like a vacation. Slim Jim has his second wind back too and chattering away about food cravings and what lies ahead. Carl told us how nice birch gap is and we can’t wait. Not only did today bring us good weather but also some trail treasures. It was like geocaching without the hunting part. First I came along a pack cover then on the next hill and bundle of rope. Here Jim stick these in your pack YOU might need them. He’s always picking up trail trash so why not get something good for once. Most hikers have already been long gone past their dropped possessions so no need to just hang up in a tree to blow around. Coming into Mollies Ridge was quite inviting. Fresh grass to set on or stretch out whichever you like and views from both sides of her ridge. I find my spot quickly and take my shoes and socks off for the first time during this trip day. Ahhh how gooood it feels. A pita with spam and taco bell hot sauce now this is the life. Jim soaks up a warm spot himself and soon the Captain comes marching in for his respite. He’s been eating like a bird due to pure exhaustion. Yes I have drove him hard this trip and he might just kick my ass. Not a hot meal since day one and I plan to feed him good tonight at our campsite. We should all be in camp well before dark and have time to socialize with others. Speaking of meeting others we soon run into Balls and Sunshine just past our lunch break. This is a father/daughter duo from California who have already hiked the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). This trail is 2650 miles long thru Washington, Oregon, and California between Mexico and Canada following the highest portion of the Sierra Nevadas. WOW. I believe she might be the youngest to have done that and if she finishes the AT and then conquers the Continental Divide trail 3100 miles out west she would be the youngest all around Triple Crown Hiker. Go Sunshine. They both were very unassuming folks with many questions and gear suggestions. Balls is known for his Trailjournal logs and Backpacking Lite knowledge and website. She asks me in a quite voice so the boys don’t hear…”Does the AT go thru Kentucky? I sure want to try some of that Kentucky Fried Chicken” I had to laugh out loud but quickly told her she could get some KFC in Gatlinburg that the trail didn’t pass thru Kentucky. Captain invited them to stop by his house for a sodas when they come to Pearisburg and we hope to see them at TrailDays. 3:40PM Birch Gap CampsiteFinally I get to relax in a sunny spot and write. My pen has been froze up for the last 2 days so writing at night has been almost impossible. Sun on my brow and camp beverage to enjoy. I’ve had my cookpot shower and my stuff is lain out waiting on my home to arrive. (Captain should be in soon and we can set up the tent). Jim has picked his spot just beside ours in the stable area. Hence his new trail name Stable Boy. Some of the shelters and campsites in the Smokies are designated for horses as well. None spotted on this trip. This nice 2 flat areas are close proximity to the only allowed fire ring and cooking area and first to see when coming into Birch Gap. There are about 7 other tent pads to choose from so we got these big ones. Stable Boy has his tarp tied to the horse rails and adjacent trees. We still expect some wind tonight and have the ‘storm doors’ pulled down to deflect the head winds. A few other campers are milling around and finding their special spots as well. Stoney Bologne, Captain(another), 2 Texas boys and Slushy. We are at 3600 feet now coming off 4300 at Russell Field. Even more down hill tomorrow to Fontana at elevation 1700 feet. My feet have felt tired but good and my legs are about as strong as I can remember. Small 300 foot climbs are easy and those 500 footers I love to challenge. Most hikers seem to be in their grove now clicking off double digit days with ease. 5:00PM Captain ArrivesHere comes my home, time to help with set up. He instructs me each stake placement and attachment. Soon our stuff in inside and ready for the night. He too has turned lowest point into the wind to keep us warmest. Sunny and 50 or so now which feels like 70 compared to the cold 20s. Captain defers social time for a nap so I shall fix supper a little later. Time to meet our fellow hikers for the night.The most interesting guy was Captain, the other captain from Florida. He was young and free using a hammock and cooking most foods over an open fire pit. He made his own cookpot but liked to only use it in dire need. Fixing chicken and dumplin and gravy to blueberry muffins the next morning I declared his name should be Cookie or Emeril. Slushy was just the opposite when it came to cooking. She didn’t like much of anything and didn’t cook very well. But she sure liked Slushies when in town. Checking back on our Captain and his supper time he has elected to stay in the bed. Yep he got chilled after his nap and is now deep in down and eating yet again only a trail bar and Reese pieces. I will make him eat a hot meal in the morning. Jim will hold him down so I can pour it in. Jim as already had first supper, he ate soon after we arrived, but will eat again while I cook my meal. Other Captain has already gathered a big load of fire wood and we help him keep it stoked while he cooks his supper. This is what it’s all about. Campfire camaraderie. Bearbags are hung, the sun goes down, campfire flickers out and so do we.","Russell Field Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/374116,"“Say wake me up when you come to bed so I can take my sleeping pill” Yes this was an actual quote from The Captain. Say What? You’ve been in bed since 6:00pm yesterday afternoon. Of course he needed to rest. Shucks just the day before he’d hiked like 14 hours. He took a rest beside the trail before making the big climb up Thunderhead. A hiker came by and said man you ok. Imagine what you’d think coming up on an old dude stretched out beside the trail? I’d probably poked him with a stick to see if he moved first. So last night I crawl into my new home, Captain’s tent, with our heads at the little end of the structure positioned for wind break. Hell there was no wind except what was coming from Captain’s side of tent during his sleep. HA! Down sleeping bags pile to the top of the mesh insert. I have what felt like 1 inch of nose room if I lay on my back. I’m suffocating already. I have left the front door open to allow at least my feet to breathe. Now it wasn’t hot last night by any means but I was sweating. Get me out of here!! Captain moves over a slight bit as I grumble to a more comfortable position. 2:30amThe pharmacy opens in the red light district. Captain rattles in his medicine box. Say Martha you need something? My hips do hurt and a little pain relief would be nice. Hey don’t you give me the wrong stuff dude. How can you tell with that red head lamp? They all look the same. Captain distributes the right dosages and we fade off till morning.With a short day ahead of us we take our time breaking camp and having breakfast. Stable Boy is relieved he has more nap time as I have instructed him to sleep in while I get some hot food in the old dude. The sun begins to rise brighter and brighter and the temps should rise along with it. We visit one last time with our camping friends and wish them well on their journey north. Our Captain is fortified and we 3 Amigos look forward to that shower at Fontana Dam and a big burger and fries from some place close on our way back to pick up the car at Newfound Gap.Cresting the side trail back to the AT, south we go. Sign says 4.8 miles to Fontana. I thought we had 5.6 according to my map but less is always nice. Shuckstack Tower is our big vocal point other than the dam today. I’ve heard of hikers sleeping in the top of this 80 foot old fire tower so they can see the sunset from up there and sunrise. Humm don’t know that I’ll be able to work up the nerve to get to the top or not. I do plan to walk the 0.1 mile to it and give it a go. More spring flowers show their faces today. I’m stopping every little bit to snap pictures and Jim is soon out of my sights. Captain is behind us but we plan to regroup at Shuckstack. Working my way up the approach to the tower turn off I know I’ll hear grief from the boys as to why we are going up. “Wasn’t this supposed to ALL down hill from here?” Guess not. I hear a voice above us and a hiker is coming down from the tower. Jim and I drop our packs and take in the grand view just from here. 360 degrees of mountains and color. There’s an old rock chimney the only remains left of a building that once was a shelter for the fire tower watchmen. The tower creaks as the hiker comes down. Yikes Jim I don’t know about this. The hiker confesses he could only go half way before his nerves got the best of him. I turn around and Jim is almost at that point already. SHIT. ‘Come on Martha, get up here” Each step up my throat gets tighter. I look out to Fontana lake hoping to draw some power that will allow me to keep going. “Come on girl get up here”I have to stop halfway. I set down. Here Jim take my camera and go on. Take those pictures so I might see what I missed. Hootie Hoot. Captain calls up to us from the trail junction and shouts out he isn’t come up here. He’s on his mission to beat us to the end. Jim takes photos all around and says if I had come up I could have given him a boost thru a trap door to go ON TOP of the tower roof. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE AND I MEAN NOW!!! I wait on him as the tower sways side to side just enough for me to go white knuckled holding on the side rails. I’m still setting down by the way.   Jim leads me off of here and we chat with another hiker who has just arrived. He plans to go to the top too. Says he hiked with Balls and Sunshine on the PCT. He carries little and looks aged with experience and hopes to catch the 2 before Hot Springs. Now that I told you how scared I was let’s tell you of what a grand site it was from the tower. The whole dam could be seen and the Little River that forms Fontana Lake. The mountain ranges of the Smokies and Nantahalas stretch for miles. Red and yellow buds brighten the tree tops as we look down on top of them. Exhilarating!Back at the trail junction Captain has made his mark and shows us the way. An arrow points down the trail. Walking pretty fast he has put some time between us. “Captain’s killing it’” Jim says. Yep he’s showing us that the old dude has some steam left. I do believe the only reason we caught him was do to the fact he stopped to talk trail gear with another ‘experienced’ hiker, aka old dude. He was sporting a Highgear pack and had been to Captain’s house before for a soda. More and more hikers are coming up from Fontana now. Some day hikers too. They are all giving that worn our look from the Twentymile Climb it’s called. Shuckstack disappears behind a mountain ridge and we are pounding down the 2000 foot drop to the dam. Ground cover is more prevalent now too. Green surrounds us and warmth comforts me. My trip is about to come to an end. Can it be? I’ve planned for months for this and we are almost a mile from it coming to a close. A kiosk marks the end of the forest trail, some road walking now to reach the waters edge. Smile boys for one last woods photo. Coming into sight the Dam is massive rising 480 feet in height and backing up water for 30 miles. It is the highest dam east of the Rocky Mountains. I look back over my shoulder and can see the Shuckstack Tower way up on the ridge. Wow we came from up there?! Walking the last few feet of the dam I look to the skies closing my eyes and feel the touch of the trail surrounding me. Thank you Lord for keeping us safe. Another section to mark off complete. Come on boys, photo finish. I see grass to rest in and can taste those ice cold drinks. I got dibs on that shower…..","Birch Gap Campsites

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378947,"I dropped my car off at Tom and Sandy’s in Damascus loaded for us when we come off the trail for a weekend at Trail Days. Jim and I met at 3:30 heading for Mountain Harbor Hostel. We’ll hit the trail tomorrow for 4 days.Hikers were corner to corner in the bunkhouse. After checking in with Mary and Terry, the hostel owners, we were pointed to the clapboard outbuilding for our quarters which turn out to be just above the animal quarters. Yep goats, horses and such are in the stables below the hiker area. We will sleep just a few feet above them. Slanted floors gave me the feeling of vertigo. Jim was staggering as well as we step over hikers setting in the floor and on each chair available. A tv blared in the corner setting on top of the refrigerator. Mary warned us it was rowdy down here, just plain LOUD.A hiker pointed us to our bunk. A king bed laying on box springs in the floor, no bed structure and separated from the rest of the room with a pull curtain and tie backs. This was supposed to sleep 3, not sure how that was gonna work out. When I laid down on the bed the ceiling was just inches from my nose with a hint of slope which causes the blood to run to your head. “This isn’t what I expected!” Jim kept saying over and over. $40??Well that beat $145 to stay in the B&B house. Besides we’re hikers right? We can sleep anywhere!!! The TV takes another octave up in loudness. I have been here once before but had only gone to the front door to drop a key and pay for car parking. Today seeing inside was quite the treat. The main house this is…A great room and kitchen wide open for serving and socializing. Big Screen tv for all to view. Mary’s office to the rear of the house and her laundry set up for all the stinky clothes coming in baskets full. At first we got the impression we were staying in here but soon picked up on a NOT. A quant setting with lots of character for sure. Getting to know the hikers here was a little slow going but you just mention a hiker feed or trail days and their attention turns to you and their ears perk up. Food is always a hot topic. We tell them of Captain’s Feed in 2 weeks and hope they make it. One hiker, Napster tells us of his Holy Cow Burger he ate at Bob’s Dairyland down the way. A 15oz double decker with chili, country ham and onion rings slapped between 3 kaiser buns. He ate it in 20 minutes along with a milk shake. HOLY COW!!! Chatty Kathy, a guy by the way, Sacaqawea and another hiker have stopped for a shower and head back out in the drizzling rain for camp. It is dusk now and most hikers are either in here or are by the next closest campsite a mile off this road. Sorting thru our gear one last time we settle in for the evening just listening to the rain on the roof and that blaring tv. It went on till midnight. I was ready for sleep by 10. The forecast is 90% chance of rain tomorrow. Guess we’ll just have to see. I won’t melt.","Home

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379057,"6:47PM Whistling GapRain taps on my tent. The storm moves past. We are dry. Dodged the rain for a third time in one day. We were dropped off this morning about 10:30 at Sam’s Gap and the rain had broken up for us so we didn’t have to just jump out of the truck and run for the woods. Before the shuttle we had breakfast at the B&B for $9 bucks. Now let me tell you this was well worth every penny a bit more than that bunkhouse mula we spent. Mary had the center island in her kitchen covered with pastries, homemade quiches, fruits, French toast with homemade syrups, roasted potatoes, caprese, sausages, berry pies, coffee, hot teas and juice. A spread fit for a king. Jim and I sat with a couple from Florida who are thru-hiking and using their retirement money to live it up on the trail, hence them staying in the ‘big’ house. Our bunk buddies are sleeping in so we have first dibs on the food and waste no time filling our plates. This will be our last ‘good’ meal till Thursday afternoon. We also met a hiker named Bumpo and another hiker who will be shuttling with us this morning. Bumpo has 75 miles to complete and will finish his journey of the AT in Damascus. A nice conclusion at Trail Days, very appropriate. Terry shuttles them to a forest road for drop off and then Jim and I another hour down the road. The storms are passing over and heavy fog awaits us when we step in the woods. The trail is like soup. Mucky with footprints deep in black mud like a cattle path. I have my gortex trail tennies on with low profile gators to keep my feet comfy and dry. Packa is on for those unexpected rain showers and easy access to pull over my head, arms and chest like a rain jacket provides protection. Jim goes with his swim shorts, which I noticed some other hikers wearing last night. He doesn’t use a pack cover just a trash bag inside his pack. I do that too but I like to keep the outside dry as well so things don’t get saturated. Been there done that in Shenandoah. We have our hardest up for the trip today or at least the highest point, 5500 feet to Bald Mountain. We hope to have lunch up there and take in the 360 degree view we’ve read about. That would put us half way in our 13.2 mile scheduled today. Feeling good we make great time and before we know it the climb is almost over. We passed a few thru-hikers on our travels. Loaded down they were with big ol packs. Fozzy Bear and Bucket List were getting water just after one climb and heard us chatting on our way up. They could believe it. They joked that I was carrying all Jim’s stuff since my pack looks way big with this cover over it. Little Bald and Bald Mountain both stretched about 2 ½ miles with open vistas and fields. Reminded me of Chestnut Knob and the Humps after Roan Mountain. The sun burned thru the clouds and I so wanted to stop for lunch here but Jim made a good call for us to keep moving as the storm clouds kept thickening. Too risky to stop now so let’s push for the shelter just a mile or so away. Stepping back into the woods it was like night and day. Another fog bank set in, the temps dropped cool and the woods grew dark giving me an eerie feeling. We hurry along. Voices I hear voices it’s coming from ahead, the shelter must be close. We duck inside the structure where 2 hikes are staying. They have already hiked their day’s trip and staying here for the night. Good heavens it’s only 2:00. Old English and Patagonia are their names. Old English is from England and travels with no shelter, no tent no nothing. WHAT? That’s risky. So they are hiking shelter to shelter and getting way early starts so they are sure to ‘have a spot’ when they arrive. I’m sure that’s not a problem since most thru-hiker hike up till dark at least.   Drops of rain begin to pelt the tin roof, a deluge is upon us. SOOO glad we pressed on for a roof over our heads. Having lunch Fozzy Bear and Bucket List arrive. They are soaked to the bone. They were caught on the Bald with no cover. They will try to dry out and stay here. Jim and I scan the skies for an opening to continue our hike to Spivey Gap 5 miles away. I really don’t want to stay here this early in the day and besides this shelter is surrounded by black mud and dark. Waiting till 3:30 we make the call to roll.Clearing skies warm the woods nicely. The trail is soggy but not as bad as we anticipated. Looking at the map we have an option for camping at Whistling Gap short of Spivey Gap. We’ll check the water source, what the weather is doing at that time, and how we feel. Getting a later start today and rain delay it will be 6:30 before we can reach Spivey Gap where we intend to camp. Mostly down hill and slick as snot our legs grow weary. Rumbles of a storm still loom around us. I feel the urgency to pull up and set up camp before it hits again. Besides we’ve evaded the rain twice already let’s not push our luck. Whistling Gap it is. We check the water source which is running nicely. Chore time. Jim hangs the bear bag. Good thing, I suck at that. I need more practice. Tents and tarps go up. I quickly take my evening sponge bath while drops fall from the sky. Hurry Hurry, the storms are circling. Darting in our shelters we are dry as the third rain event passes over. Stretching out in my tent sipping my cocktail I’m just were I wanted to be on my first night of this trip. I relax and listen. Rumbles move on. A warm light brightens my tent and the woods. Greens come alive as leaves drip with the spring rain. Stoves simmer with our supper and the sun begins to fall from the sky. Now this is hiking.","Sams Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379131,"7:04AM the next morning.Well what would an adventure be without having to cut off your shorts. No it wasn’t a drinking game nor an initiation. Well it could have been the later. An initiation to the trail…a trail of tears. Fellas I do understand. Can we say galded, heat rash, burns like fire and hurts like hell. My inner thighs were flaming red by the end of this long day and here I set this morning after cooling down overnight cutting my Pategonia long johns down to long undershorts to keep me from heating up again today. Here I go..We pulled out of camp by 8am this morning in hopes of making up the ground we lost yesterday. The clouds still continue to hang heavy with just a ray of light hitting our path. We’re pretty much in the thick of the woods now and much undergrowth to scan over. What is that I do see, yellow lady slippers. YES, 3 little pods. The only place I’ve ever seen grow in the wild is by my hiking buddy Captain’s place off Stony Creek in Pearisburg VA. He will love this photo when we send to him. There were many other pretties spotted today, Galax, May Apple, Colorful Mushrooms, Flame Azalea and more. Reaching Spivey Gap boy weren’t we glad we stayed where we did last night. A dark bottom of a gap surrounded with heavy rhododendron bushes. Damp. Coming into this last night at dusk would have meant setting up in the dark and getting cold pretty quick.Across the road a sign notes who maintains the trail from here to Damascus. None other than Bob Peoples. I love this man. He gathers workers year around to fix the trail and reroute areas deteriorating with erosion. What this means for us is a trail easier to walk as it is laid more flat in nature and less steep going up and down the mountains. Long graded switchbacks making my feet very happy. Our next break will be at No Business Shelter. We’ve decided to maintain our strength and leg power it’s a good idea to break this long day into 5 mile increments. Almost 18 miles to complete and with packs makes you very tired quick. The last climb up to No Business was a dozy. Needing lunch and hot with sweat I was ready for a break. I see how this shelter gets its name. Defiantly a place lacking business. Another dark old shelter made of a cinder block base sleeping about 6. My lunch was the only good part of this place. I take my shoes off to cool my feet while Jim stretches out on the floor. Old English and Pategonia arrive a few minutes later tired also. They are pushing for Uncle Johnny’s in Erwin for a night’s stay and shower. We of course will pass this too but carry on for Curley Maple Gap for our stopping point. Jim led us to town striding to make these 5 miles in less than 2 ½ hours. Our goal, reach Erwin and the Nolichucky River by 3:30. The path is suited for it, quick pace is set and a gradual descent of 1500 feet. Final elevation 1700 at the river. I can hardly keep up with Slim Jim. Each bend of the trail curves in and out of the mountain. Seems like déjà vu at every turn. Finally the River appears at the last bend. She’s running red with clay from all the rain. Jim has canoed here before and tells me stories of this trip. #1 instruction, “when things look bad paddle like hell!” Speaking of hell, this is about when my inner thighs turned to burning torches between my legs. I’ve made it to the Nolichucky River by 3:30 but it has come with a price. OUCH, What the hell is going on? Crotch Rash, Damn it!!! I dig for my body glide but it is too late. We have 5 more miles to go and I begin to worry about it. If you never seen body glide it’s a trail essential. I normally use it on my feet to keep them moist and friction free. It is a slick, almost waxy product, made to do just that- prevent friction. I made the mistake of not applying prior. Jim is like do you wanna call it quits, get a ride some place? What, dude are you crazy? My legs aren’t coming off they just hurt.Old English and Pat come in and take a rest with us and have a little left over trail magic I find in a cooler by the door. Luke cold beers. The outfitter has left for a shuttle and will return soon so they can check in. I meander around the place checking out this little piece of heaven and would certainly stay had we had the real need. Cabins, Showers, Supplies. Maybe we will see them in Damascus time to go.We have on heck of a climb to end an 18 mile day. 1300 feet with a last 500 foot incline over like quarter of a mile. Not only is my heat rash hurting but my shoulders are feeling a day’s workout in this pack. Jim too, he struggles to keep the pace he once was setting. I start a pack inventory in my head of what I could throw out. Just about everything except my body glide. HAI put my head down passing Jim as he takes a break for some food and motivation to get up to our shelter. 100, 200, 300 feet. Only 200 more to go. Looking at my altimeter on the way up helps inspire me to keep going, I am closing in on it. New wood appears thru the forest trees, the shelter, I am here. The shelter was rebuilt not long ago and holds 14. Big and accommodating with a nice awning over the picnic table to keep things dry while cooking. NICE. Two levels for hikers to sleep. A couple is here. 2 Fellows from the Netherlands, the Dutch Boys, Kool Kutz and Nugget. They welcome me in as I walk with the true hiker hobble now. Jim comes in just 20 minutes behind me bushed too. We are so tired making sense of conversation and trying to cook at the same time becomes a chore. I do ask the boys how they got there names. Kool Kutz was a barber shop place where he got his long hair cut off some time ago and Nugget is from eating all the Chicken Nuggets he can when in town. Talking soccer and trail info we get to know one another. I have accessed my ‘ordeal’ and conversed with the boys (my husband included) on remedies. Desperate times call for desperate measures. “May I have some Gold Bond please and a cup of tea?” Dusting my area out back of the shelter while they chuckle from the other side sweet relief comes. Commando tonight in my sleeping bag and will ponder cutting off my long johns in the morning. Sleep tight and don’t let the crotch rash bite.","Whistling Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379260,"Glad we just stayed in the shelter last night. A good rain came in the night and that would have meant packing up wet stuff this morning. Besides we were way too tired to fool with camp set up. A mat on a board floor and sleeping bag is all I needed. 
I have cut off my johns and feeling great this morning. I am looking forward to some sunshine. Please give me a little blue sky – Beauty Spot could offer just that. We have that peak and Unaka Mountain ahead of us. 
With only 12 miles today we feel pretty good about it. Still fatigue in my legs but they are rested. My lower back and shoulders are telling me I have been carrying that 28lb pack for a few days. It is getting lighter as I eat up my food and drink but I know it’s there for sure. 
Once we get going and settled in on the trail its back to business as usual. Let me Lead and let’s get up this mountain Jim. Just as I get to a trail sign for Iron Mountain I see red from behind a tree, it’s trail magic! 7 or so cans of soda. We just had a small break just before here so Jim takes on the burden of hauling our Cokes in his pack so we can have with our lunch. Thanks man!!
Sun fills the skies. I’m smiling from ear to ear. Yes I love it. A forest fire has come thru here. Low under growth is all that surrounds us and an open, wide trail ahead of us. Colorful rhododendrons dot the landscape too. HOT baby HOT. It’s heating up. What did I wish for? Sun? Well we got it now and it is draining the life out of us on this climb. Jim gives a sigh and begins talking to himself. “Come on Jim, Come on”. Hell I even take a break. Sweat rolls off my nose. Where’s the top?
Soon an open field comes to sight but the climb isn’t over. One more up and down to a fire ring surrounded by this grassy ridge. Looks like a house is just over the hill too. We see a rock grouping down near a parking lot and decide that’s the best place to dry out. Crashing on the ground and I rest my head back on my pack for the sun to touch my face. AHHH this is nice. We would have stayed on the crest but really hazy and not really much of a view. Besides the skies still look threatening and we are closer to the woods in case we must take cover quickly. Downing our Cokes with our lunch we cheer the mountain and look over our maps for the next big climb of the day.
Having our second wind the walk off Beauty Spot was quite nice. We reload water at Deep Gap and ready for our ascent to the forest of red spruce. They say it looks like Maine. I’m excited to get there so hang on Jim here we go. 1000 feet to climb. There’s supposed to be forest road half way but never cross it so we have come farther than we realize. A beautiful climb with more grass lining the trail. Tall majestic trees invite us in at the top. It does look like Maine. “Watch for the blazes Jim. It will be hard to find a trail 
in this dense forest with all the spruce needles on the ground.” No definition of a path between the trees. Darker in here too. Only 4 miles to go. We’ll be at the shelter by 5:00. Liken that.
Taking a few breaks to keep our strength up we ease into Cherry Gap before we know it. An old structure sleeping 6. I see my tent spot right here. I’m all about getting my last night sleep in my tent before our adventure comes to a close. Jim tends to like the shelters and says it was provided why not use it. He has it all to himself for now. It is early so who knows if those behind us will stay the night. 
Two piped springs run behind and below the shelter. Jim gathers water and hangs our bear bag rope while I set up my camp. Soon a hiker comes in, Detour. He’s in a run and stopping to refuel and deciding if he’ll go on to the next shelter 9.6 miles away. Heck man its 6 now. He’s averaging 20 mile days and trying to catch some friends ahead of him. Pulling out a 3 liter jug of what looked like tea he gulps some down while preparing his food. After more conversation he decides staying here will be best and gulps his juice some more. Having my cocktail I offer to share, that’s when we find out his juice is left over beer from the night before when at Uncle Johnny’s. He’s come 19 miles and got a late start to get here. Telling him we plan to come off the trail tomorrow and head for Damascus and Trail Days his eyes widen. Hearing about it we give him more details and he is all about it. ‘Can I get a ride?’

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379293,"Breaking camp this morning I feel like a thru-hiker. I sure smell like one. A few days of the same routine of busting camp, taking down the bear bag, gathering water for the day, and putting your essentials on your back and well just walking. I like it. Could I do it day in and day out for 6 months? Heck I can’t wait to get to town today and I’ve only been out for 4 days. I try to bath a little each night to keep the stink at bay and give me a little freshness from a hot day but I notice many hikers just let that ‘work’ go. Come into camp cook a meal, drink some water, put on camp clothes which is usually just a different shirt and may shorts and go to bed. A lot prefer the shelter to sleep too. Less work involved setting up and tearing down a tent each day. I love that part actually so I do ponder could I REALLY do it? I know one thing for sure I will continue to put on my pack and keep hiking and for sure make it lighter each trip too. Today I’m down 5 lbs of pack weight and that’s just from food and drink. No more deodorant, no more extra clothing, humm what else could I leave out? NOT Body Glide that’s for damn sure!! ;o)The boys have starting stirring and we are ready to hike out by 8am. No real rush but the sooner we finish the sooner we can have that Cheese Burger at Bob’s Dairyland and be in Damascus for the fun. Detour is gonna beat us to the car by a long shot so Jim and I try to get a head start on him but he passes us in less than 30 minutes. 12 or so miles today, a short day for him, a normal day for us. The day couldn’t be more nice. Sun, Warm, Smooth path for the trail which winds thru farm fields, orchards and hardwoods just like at home. Setting check points once again to break down our day makes for an easy trip. Just get me to this 4 miles and then these 4 miles and so on. Jim falls behind early, OUCH my knee!! No time to pull up lame now Jimbo. Slowly he works it out but each time it flares again. Digging in his pack he pulls out an ointment called Biofreeze. Lathering the knee up in hopes this will fix what’s ailing. Me on the other hand have caught my stride. Fresh as a summer breeze...well all most…you better not be down wind of me. My sticks clicking. I’m out to catch Detour. Yeah right!!! Besides he’s long gone by now and I’m too busy scoping for new flowers. Jack in the Pulpits every where, Hogwarts, Wild Geranium. But no Dutchman Britches, I’ve looked high and low. Old English spotted some yesterday that I missed. Rats. Cresting a knoll and a nice camp spot I take a rest. I’ve put a little distance between Jim and myself so better wait for him to catch up. I’m sure he’s still talking. That boy talks like no other. The only time his chatter stopped was when he got really tired going up Beauty Spot and oh yeah Curley Maples last 500 feet. Silent Stable Boy he was. A snake slithers across the trail and crickets pop in what seemed like the hundreds. Is it the end of times like one of the biblical plagues? Mountains stretch across my horizon and the sun warms my shoulders. I could sit here all day. Jim approaches.Several more miles to the next scheduled stop for lunch which will be at Clyde Smith Shelter. Detour knows this but we’ll have to see if he waits on us. One there we’ll only have 4 miles left on our journey. I can’t believe it is coming to an end.Now I have already told you about Bob Peoples. Well these next few miles are his work at its best. I plan to hug him with I get to Trail Days. He’ll be working his booth for Hardcore, a sign up for any one wanting to help with his maintenance of the trail. You work the week after trail days. He will shuttle you to the work site and back to wherever you have left off on the trail. We now walk on a gentler slopes from reroutes. Now he’ll leave some kick ass climbs which you have to. You wanna see what’s up there right? I know I do. Each time a big mountain stood in our way the path veered around the edge for smooth sailing. I’d see the mountain approach and call out ‘Be good to us Bob” and he always listened.Having this ‘easy’ trail on all but 2 climbs I’m feeling pretty good about myself today and me becoming that thru hiker. I’m out front again and walking with a quick and confident pace stopping only to take flower pictures and to scan the forest for other hidden treasures. Then wham, my feet start that ache. An ache that hurts to the bone. The balls of my feet are now on fire and my little toe is screaming for some air. Jim sneaks back up to me feeling pretty good now his knee hurt has subsided. We press for the shelter, us old creaky section hikers. 1 more mile and 500 feet to go. At least the terrain is pleasant to look at, Thick light grass covers the ground between the trees. I could just lay down in it and be swallowed up. You’d never know I was here it is so high. I can’t hike fast enough to get off my feet. Hope the water source is close and deep, my feet will go for a swim.Detour is finishing his lunch as we come in to the shelter area. Dropping my pack I here Jim read the shelter sign about where the water is. Damn 100 yards down behind the shelter. Off I go, inching down. A piped spring, which most of our sources have had on this trip, runs full. Off with my shoes and socks and splash my tootsies are in. Steam rolls off the water, ice cold and just what the doctor ordered. Washing off I feel like a new woman. Jim heads down as I come back out of the hole. Soon we are on the last stretch of miles headed for Hughes Gap.Detour has already headed for the car. Sure hope its there. Our last up, Little Rock Knob. Twisted steps of rock meander along a narrow ledge to the top. Now this IS hiking. Sweat drips off my face, this reminds me of Maine. Each opening seems like the top but not quite. Look a chair. The TOP. A small fold out seat has been left on a precarious ledge of slanted stacked rock, photo op. Jim is first to test it out. He eases his butt back into it holding on for balance. Unaka Mountain to our left, a day’s hike away, we were just there. Roan Mountain to back. This by far our best view of the entire trip. What a treat. Leading off the mountain we recap our adventure and what lies ahead. We both can’t wait for the road. “I see a truck,” Jim. “Where’s my car?” he says. A few more steps from around a curve and there it sets along with Detour. 3:19, not bad for some section hikers who told him we’d be arriving abut 3:00. Yes I am a section hiker for sure.

Jim and I heard of this place our first night at Mtn Harbor Hostel. Napster downed one of their Holy Cow Burgers. I had to see it. No one in our group ordered but we did see a picture of this mound of meats. Cardiac Arrest!! Here’s the contents:
3	five ounce patties
3	slices of cheese
6	slices of bacon
3	country ham
2	onion rings
1	scoop of chili
All for one low price of $8.99!!!
Detour being a vegetarian got the appetizer sampler with all fried goodies that didn’t have meat. Tator Tots, Fried Shrums, Fried broccoli, fries and cheese sticks. Jim got the double bacon cheese burger and tots and me I settled for the single Bacon cheese burger and a big orange soda. Stuffed. Now where’s the closest gas station for a cold beer.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/379438,"It wouldn’t be trail days without a parade and a fire ring. We participated in both and did it well. We hit the fire ring both Friday and Saturday with the later day being our day in the ring. Don’t go in to long or you’ll never get out. Dancing around a large ring of fire with drums thumping in the background can be quite the experience. Throw in fire eating hikers and some fire twirlers and you got a show. At the parade Bonnie and I adorned our hiker babe skimpy bikini pullover shirts which gave us that knock out look that would stop most any man in his tracks. The Captain took the show with his six pack abs and speedo. Yep them buns were a showing. Dustin and his daughter Hailey rounded out our group with Dustin in his coconut tatas and grass skirt while Hailey was the more conservative of the bunch opting of tattoos and a pretty hat and beads. Smart girl. Waiting for the parade to start the outfitter provided hotdogs to all. I met many folks. One group in particular, The Family From the South, I called them; from Florida a mom and her 5 children. Mamma Queen had her little clan hiking big sections this year and hope to thru hike next year. Ages ranged from 13 her oldest boy to 3 her youngest little boy. 2 girls in between and Happy Jack who offered me some of his snacks while they waited and asked his mom why they where in town and not on the trail. Good luck to them.Our wagon is full of ammunition, ICE COLD WATER, which Dustin pulled along so we could reload our super soaker water guns. Captain’s fire extinguisher was the go to cannon in dire emergencies when the audience pounded us from all sides. Some top window shooters were caught by surprise when the hose came out and they were drenched before they could duck for cover. I was first shot in the back right out of the gate with a 5 gallon bucket dumped on my back. It was so forceful most of the water ended up in my left ear to give me swimmers ear for the duration of the parade. Then near the end a fellow feeling froggy darted out in the middle of the parade to take a picture and started to get pelted with water from other hikers. When he retreated Captain and I shot him in the back with our soakers. Well he took offense and came after me slapping my gun to the ground. Now that just didn’t suit me fellow hiker friends (strangers to me by the way, just parade marchers like me) they surrounded him and escorted him to the sidelines where thing calmed down and the parade went on. WEW another close call. Remember the little girl that soaked me last year near the end of the parade and I grabbed her hose and got her back? Something about that bridge at the end of town I might just have to start avoiding it.To say the least we all had a ball and look forward to trail days next year.","Damascus

Empty mason jars with a hint of mountain fruit elixir scattered the picnic tables. Hiker Olympics was a big hit this year even with a somewhat smaller crowd. Let’s see what’s in that pack. Backpack Scavenger was led by a tally of 15 unusual items. Our very own Ian took top honors in the bobbing for marshmallow competition. All about aluminum is always our most interesting event with folks creating something with aluminum foil. You’ll have to see the pictures on this one as words just can’t express it. Double beer bongs, bagpipes, virus man, and the him/she, nice cans baby!!!! Stinky shirts to hairiest legs participants brought the best out of the woods. Limbo finished with a high jumping competition. Waste no water our final event pitted 3 three man teams pitching water to fill a final bucket the most. Well most just got wet. A fly by to salute us and our stinky friends had to be the highlight of the day. Moon that plane!!!! Thanks Harry!!Ian our bagpipe playing little man settled the crowd a bit while we listened to his sweet notes of harmony taking us on a Scottish trip winding us back to our roots of Amazing Grace. A fine rendition if I say so myself.The zipline ran up into the night with hikers coming over stony creek to Captains yard. Tent counted to 47 and hiker total probably 70. Good thing we had some help from Four Pines hostel owner bringing in a pork loin and deer burgers or we’d run out of grub. Music filled the air as cd’s spun flat footin tunes and hippy beats.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394057,"Hiking season. Fall. Leaves. It’s here. I couldn’t wait for Sunday to come. I had my Larry saying he was going to hike with me BUT only if it was short. HA Like I didn’t know that already. I had word that so and so might come too. But who really would be there when we showed up?. My phone rings twice before I get out of the Pulaski town limits with news that Sandra is bringing 4 more besides her hubby and then Harry informs me 4 are coming with him and little bitty rascal too. This is gonna be a great day.Pulling up to the register at the falls our line of cars forms. $3 please..If you decide you don’t need to pay then the fine is a cool $75. So you choose your donation. I hardly get the car in park before jumping out to greet everyone. Look here comes Anna and TJ. Low and behold Denny Wayne and Noni show. How long has it been? No matter it’s good to see everyone. Lining up for the trek I trot right to the front. Where else would I go? As usual this hollor hike is crisp. Fall is surely in the air. Anna and TJ gather up behind me and the rest take their pecking order. Say Sandra are you watching Noni’s boots? Django be sure to keep in line now. I always take the lower trail up to the falls so we can walk along the waters edge, it’s the best part besides the destination. Lots of rock steps to quickly get our legs warm and hearts pumping. Stopping at the first landmark, an old saw mill, the group comes back together. Adam and Heather have their son and he is loving his trip up the trail on daddy’s back. I’m sure ole Larry would love to be in that cat bird’s seat as well. HALeaves dot the rocks on Little Stony Creek. Sun rays part the tall trees around us and invite us on up the way. Creek flow is down a bit so I’m hoping the falls are still holding on for that nice view when we arrive. Closing in we notice a large rock slide across the creek. Slate sheets have piled up to almost cut a quarter of the stream flow. No telling how loud that was at impact. TJ and Anna wow at the falls and I snap my photos. Love this place. Ok troops let’s gather around now, 10 seconds, snap. Smiles with hoops and hollers fill the air. Harry’s skydiving friends size up the falls, all 66 feet of her. I see the wheels turning in their heads of base jumping off it. They’ll jump off anything. I’ll keep my feet on the trail thank you.Speaking of trail this day just isn’t over for me. Gotta make it on up to Barney’s Wall. Any takers? The yuts are game. Anna and TJ. Yuts meaning youths if you haven’t seen the movie, My Cousin Vinny. All others elect to visit some more here and we’ll meet them back at the parking lot.Ok guys this is the ‘real’ up for the day. This section will add 4 more miles to our already 4 to make me a happy girl. Sharing my past hikes up this way and some other AT trail stories passes our time. Having the kids makes me work hard on the climb. TJ hardly misses a breath while talking too. Anna is some quite and stays right on my heels. Are we almost there yet? She says. My favorite words!! We catch up to 2 other gals heading our same way. Oh and we also met some hikers who were coming off the mountain from camping at Barneys Wall. The rock over look is just that; a wall of rock 700 feet high. Climbing up to here will give us a 1600 foot elevation gain for the day and a view over Pembroke that was quite spectacular. The gals haven’t been here before and I encourage them to come on down to the edge after they stopped at the camping fire pit which looked like the end of the trail. Don’t get too close to the ledge TJ!!! My vertigo keeps me from getting out to far. Colors of fall are most vivid here as well. A few weeks and the trees will peak. Wonder how the bunch has made it to the parking lot? Bet the stories are a plenty down there. Come on guys we better get going so they don’t drink all our beverages and leave us for lunch.Remember all the up? Well we go all that down now. Anna sighs but is happy to be here glad she gave it a go. Before we know it we are back to the junction sign. Them kids can really push a girl. My feet and knees were a screaming from the pace. They just stride on with no sticks almost in a skip running off here. Seemed like it only took 15 minutes to reach the falls. When’s the next hike TJ asks? Next week baby you just stick with me and you’ll be out here more than you know. The parking lot is full now. Glad to be ‘out’ we shed the shoes and air the feet. Ahhh nothing like warm sun on tired toes. This fine group has meshed quite well to becoming good friends. Oh yes the tales were told, far fetched and real. Larry says his life at home will be sweet as honey this week since his hiker chick got her woods fix. I thank the good Lord for dropping you all in my mix.","Parking Lot Pembroke

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394420,"8:48PMThe stars are out. The boys chatter by the campfire. One SOBO and 2 section hikers are bunked in the shelter. I’m warm in our tent. Nice!!!Meeting this morning at 11:00 couldn’t have come quick enough for me. Come on Larry get up….I was up at 7:00, Packed Jack’s pack with my extra tent, a borrowed sleeping mat and my old sleeping bag. Only thing left was to see what this first time hiker was going to bring. Mom helped. Don’t laugh now. It’s was sweet. She was making sure her boy wasn’t gonna get cold or hungry. Cotton was everywhere. Cotton socks, cotton shirt, cotton sweatpants, cotton cotton. The trash bag with all these belonging was sorted and handed back full to dad to take back home. Jack stood in our driveway wide eyed. Putting some lighter weight items in for replacements like silk weight long johns and shirt, smartwool socks made the pack load nicely once it was all sorted out. Oh and dump out that extra bottle of water, we’ll be walking right by a creek. What about my mountain dew? YES you may take it. That’s your pleasure item I grinned. Hell we all been there. Packing 40 pounds plus on my first overnight I sure wish I’d had a Lead Dog to sort my stuff and lighten my load. I can hear you wondering, who is Jack? Well he is a son of a couple we know. He hiked one day to the cascades and said he wanted to see more. Then he went the Mtn Lake and walked his folks to death and then heard about the AT. Well that’s when his dad said we gotta call Larry. His wife loves that place. So here we are. This 15 year old is about to take his first steps on the AT and I sure want to make sure he has a lasting impression of this experience.Anna and TJ are meeting us as well but just coming in for the day. I plan to put them on fire wood collection when we reach the shelter. With the rain forecasted for later tonight we want to gather as much wood beforehand as we can. We’ll hike in 2.5 miles to Laurel Creek Shelter set up camp then hike on up to Kelly’s Knob for a late lunch and take in the view.Waiting for the Yuts to show I begin pacing at the parking spot. 11, 11:15, 11:30 we gotta roll. The dark clouds are gathering and every minute here we’re wasting. I leave a note telling them which direction to hike. They will surely catch us anyways with our larger packs. Into the field we go. Past the big barn. No donkey’s in sight today.Once in the woods I feel a since of relief. Not sure why. Guess because we are finally here, on the trail. The woods feel comforting. A chance of rain gives me some anxiety but the woods help. A gust of wind catching us shortly after the first mile, I see heaviness in the skies. Just enough to be cautious and instruct the boys to put on their pack covers. Drizzle and we all know what happens when you do that…it stops and the sun comes out.Warming us it is perfect hiking weather. Cool and refreshing. Reds and oranges brighten our path. Larry brings up the rear while Jack keeps pace with me looking over his shoulder every so often to catch Larry’s eye. Telling hiking stories and landmarks coming up I say there’s a haunted house ahead Jack. What? Where? We aren’t staying there are we? The three story clap board farm house has many tales of its origin. All I know is it looks haunted with those black tar handprints along its walls and has had creepy sounds of creaking planks as if someone was walking in the house as we looked inside on past visits. Check this out guys, one of the clap boards is up here by the trail. I look down to where the house should be and ...NO HOUSE? It is a complete pile of rubble. Did lightening strike? I don’t see burned wood. Did the winds just blow it down? Who knows. Crossing the creek the shelter isn’t far. I hear voices. Hootie Hoot!! It’s Anna and TJ, they did catch us. With relief in her voice Anna says with some shortness of breath they’ve been running to catch us. TJ said they had gone in and out the county lines like 4 times after turning around on Rt. 42 for fear of going the wrong way. They just hadn’t driven far enough each time to see the church at Level Green and where to park.The creek is hardly a flow. Hope our water source below the shelter is better than right here. And it was but not by much. Reaching the shelter the work begins. Tents go up and fire wood is stashed under the shelter floor space to keep dry. Water filtered and Larry settled to his resting position. “I’ll just watch camp, ya’ll go on up to the knob, I’ll keep things safe here” he says. I’d put money on that being said since this morning. Off to the knob the young one’s lead the way. This old dog will have to take the rear now. Anna leads and a quick lead it is. She’s almost in a skip, feet hardly hitting the ground. TJ runs to keep up, Jack too. Me I’ll keep my pace here and know they will burn themselves out soon enough at that rate and with this increasingly steeper climb. YES the Yuts are wearing me out AGAIN. How much farther Anna shouts back? We’ll if you keep your pace 6 minutes I say. 10 for the rest of us. I give her directions to the turn off and sign for the overlook. She disappears, Anna Poppins is gone baby gone. And her trail name is born.Cool now on the mountain crest I begin to wonder if we’ll make it back before a shower blows in. We met 2 older ladies coming off the mountain asking for the shelter. Guess Larry will have company after all and will entertain them I’m sure. At the knob the kids scamper from rock to rock and down every nook and cranny. Jack’s a regular Houdini disappearing in and out of the crevices. TJ follows. I’m glad he’s along to get down there with him. Remember I’m in charge of bringing this boy back home to mama in one piece. JACK, GET BACK UP HERE. Anna huddles into a ball, goose bumps on top of goose bumps. I’ve layered on my rain jacket for a wind break and she follows suit. A quick downed lunch was had by all. We did enjoy our views but were ready to retreat to the warmth of the woods. Back at the AT junction the kids double check their headed direction with me before hitting their high geared pace back. Jack lingers a tad to keep sight of me. And then TJ takes the lead to back Miss Anna off her run. Thank you TJ. Guess I’m getting a taste of my own medicine. A game forms with a leaf toss and the next thing I know this old gal has hit the ground. Yep knees planted hard to break my fall on the rocks and my hands to catch me just in time so I don’t face plant. Only takes a second to stumble when not looking where you’re walking. Getting up they make sure I’m ok and off we go. No worries. I’ll walk out the pain. So I think.Sunshine, blue skies, way cool. This hike just keeps getting better. Is that Larry talking to himself? A section hiker has arrived. Decked out in his blaze orange and stretched out for a rest on the shelter floor reading over his maps. Should I stay or should I go? That’s always the question about 4:00 for a hiker when they’ve come to a shelter and its still daylight. How many more miles can I walk before dark? “Hey we got fire and fire water”. Guess what he decided to do? Word must have gotten out cause we another hiker showed up and then another. What can we say we draw a crowd!!TJ and Anna have to leave so to make it out before dark and get to those fun activities kids do on a weekend. Thanks for all the help guys. Remember to follow the white blazes. LOLJack and Larry get a fire started early just for fun and to make sure the coals are good and hot before any rain that might come. I find the last sunny spot between the trees and read the paper we brought in. Section hiker John from PA gets his camp clothes on and bunk set up on one side of the shelter while SOBO hiker Turtle Box does the same on the other side. Daniel who has come in last sets up his tent. He is from Huntington and out till Tuesday to ‘stretch his legs’. He is almost retired and the wife just had her knees worked on. He has thru hiked before and they plan to do it all next year. John is over half way finished with his section hiking lacking New Hampshire and Southern Maine, I think. Turtle Box started at Katahdin in June and looks like he’s more than settled in to make the finish in GA. Jack studied each hiker and listened closely to all their stories. He asked only questions quietly to Larry or myself every now and again commenting only when asked. He was surprised at how little they carried and how much they ate. Do they all stink like that? Yep and you will too Jack. It’s inevitable. He shacks his head. What’s for supper? Larry spouts. Help me out Jack, aren’t you hungry? What did you do with those 3 samiches? I begin to cook up chili, have hot sauce. Mac and Cheese, who wants what? How about some apple pie and I don’t mean the dessert kind. Fireside with trail magic. Yumm Yumm good. Turtle Box even had 3 huge marshmallows he’d been saving to roast. They were so big he got 2 to 3 roastings off each one licking his fingers clean each time. Boys I think I’ll turn in now while the skies are clear and I am fire warmed. I hope the rain has missed us by chance. Jack be sure to zip your rain fly now just in case. Put on your wool socks. There’s another fleece in your pack too. I sound like Noni. Larry’s like what about me….Love you too honey....","Rt. 42

It warmed up during the night I had to come out of my dew rag and unzip my sleeping bag a bit. Larry tosses beside me trying to adjust to these tight quarters. No comparison to our King size where his arms and legs are stretched out like an octopus. The only other night noises I heard were a few down wind crack-offs from the shelter not to mention those coming from our tent. I do believe if a match had been struck we’d been blown clear back to our car. Wondering how Jack is doing over in his tent I turn back over and fall asleep.Waking at my normal 5:30 I cat nap till more daylight comes and nature is just too strong to hold off any more. The rain has tapered off so I get my shoes and hat on to make a dash for the privy. No one else is up 7:00. Hikers usually delay that early departure if it is raining and those here are doing just that. Larry gets those few extra winks while I pack up my things inside our tent. With the window of opportunity to pack up without a down pour I’m all about us getting to it. I check in with Jack and he is in the process of packing too. Wait Wait don’t bring all your stuff out to the shelter just pack up inside your tent. Much easier that way and you avoid dropping something on the wet ground. First time procedures are many and he is doing well to take them all in. Where does this go and how to I fold this mat? How are we gonna get the tent dry? My shoes are squishy. I had to laugh a bit to myself. Larry begins taking down our tent while I help Jack with his. Before we know it we are ready to go even before the 2 section hikers are. No chance in beating the thru-hiker out. Turtle Box was gone 30 minutes before us. Stop to see the Captain I shouted out to him as he departed. Temps are rather nice this morning just a coolness in the air not even glove worthy. Rain gear on due to the drizzle and to keep some dry on the walk out. Jack do you have those socks I gave you still dry? Yes Ma’mam. Those will come in handy when we reach the car. Larry offers his crocs for later too. A smile on his face he seems happy still to be here.Even with the night time rain the creek we cross hasn’t filled a bit. Before we know it we’re back at the first sight of the fields which means only a 1 more to walk out. Food is on Larry’s mind and soon becomes the topic of where to eat breakfast. Me I’m already thinking of where we can hike next not only a day trip but another overnight. Jack says he is in just tell him when. That make me smile all over inside.See up there, that’s where the trail keeps going. Sarver Holler, the Keffer Oak and much more. I will take you there for sure.

A few made a wrong turn but came in just as my train was pulling in. There was a lot of cotton and a lot of what should I wear. As little as possible it’s gonna be warm today folks and you’ll be out of those long sleeves before the first turn on the trail. A train of 10 today I shall lead and hopefully some will keep on following right on over the tooth down to Trout Creek. I intend to get my 8 miles in today and will take along anyone willing. The L-Train was mighty glad to have some other followers cause he sure the hell didn’t want that on his plate. Shuttle service is more on his mind and good Italian meal after the hike.Ages from 8 to 80…gotcha! No one was 80 but some sure hit that number on the heat register. Say Sandra how hot did that face get topping the tooth today? She might have just earned a new trail name, Fire Engine Red or maybe Stop Sign Face.Our youngest Hailey was quite shy at first leading her daddy Mike up the trail but was quick to make friends. Little Jack brought his mom and pop along, Jennifer and Scott, both newcomers to the AT. Sure hope they come back after this technical climb. At the first big group stop she gasp saying next time she’d wear less and bring her inhaler. My lead pack moved along quite well only having to stop for water and photos on the way up. I tried to put Anna Poppins out front but she would have no part of it. A late night and not much fuel in the tank set her back a step. But only a step, she was right on my heals all day. With Bon Bon and my golfin buddy, Leila in tow there was plenty of laughter to spread around. Ascending to the tooth is a workout no matter how many times I’ve climbed it. Say did my legs get shorter or my strength get weaker? One ledge I took a step up and well my ass didn’t follow. I was in limbo man. Do I keep grunting, do I ask for a push, maybe Anna will just do it…nada…then by the grace of god a little more umph and I was up and moving again. Yeah go ahead and laugh, who’s next? Views out were pretty good today. Some haze made the crispness off leaf color wash out but still nice just the same. We didn’t meet hardly anyone till reaching the summit junction. Dragon’s tooth left and Trout Creek right. Say Leila you been to the top before? Why yes and today she will too. A gal not much on getting left behind or out done she took Anna right up thru the access spot and was on the top before I could blink. I’d say her pops named her just right with Slippery. Not much gonna get by her and you just never know where she might turn up. Glad she turned up with us today.Bonnie and I find a sunny spot for us to have a snack and wait on the others. Hour and 50 minutes to get here they should be along in about 15 to 30 minutes. We don’t want to tarry too long we have 5.4 miles to go. Getting a little start on them and their shorter return trip back to the car will allow us all to finish closer to the same time.More folks begin to arrive. Too crowded for me. I get antsy. I hear Larry’s voice then come Scott and Jennifer but no Jack. What I was gonna take him across the mountain with me. He has taken a turn for the worse feeling some sick with sinus. I bet he’s coolin it on a rock and didn’t want to be caught with this pack of girls. Can’t blame him for that, not many men would be either. Shortly comes along that fire engine I was telling you about. Sandra’s face red as a stop sign and ready for a break. Mike and daughter are right behind her fresh as spring. They have their lunch and Larry takes the ‘family’ back down with him. Come on girls we have tracks to make. Trout Creek side of is much more forgiving on the knees but still has lots of down. We have views off both sides of the ridge and enjoy the warm blasts of wind and sun. Chattering along we wonder if a bear might be seen and were all the birds are today. It is quite over here the trail less traveled. Only one couple did we meet. Anna is already curious of what to wear come colder weather. Ah yes I just might have this one hooked. Watch out Anna, Bonnie says, she’ll have you out in the dead of winter. She about froze out my Jeffie one time. It was twice I do believe. Slippery is in awe at beauty of the trail. Say what’s those double blazes for? That means a turn is ahead. Ya’ll just keep following ol Lead Dog. A quick break for some girls just wanna have fun and some snap crackle and pop. Say where did Slippery get off too? I HEAR you. Switchback time and we’ll be closer to Trout Creek. Check out the grove of birches. Love this spot. There’s the shelter sign we have about a mile to go. Sure hope Larry’s got the Blue Hen waiting on us and a cold drink. Say let’s soak our feet in the creek when we get there!!!One last pull to climb and over the hill we go. Striding briskly I hear the gravel road noise of a car going by. Can’t see it just yet but it’s around the corner. They’ll hear us talking ya know. Sound carries from here. Toot toot a horn blows. Sure hope that him Leila says and not some backwoods man looking for us. Don’t worry we can out run Bonnie. LOL. Hootie Hoot. I point out the road and the creek. Come on girls lets dive in. Our chauffer has arrived cold brew in hand. Come on ladies let go I’m hungry. Not before we get our feet wet. Rolling his eyes Larry settles in while we scurry to cool our jets and rest on the creek bank. The water’s so cold it made my head hurt. Ah that good and tired feeling.

Last visit here over 2 years ago I left with nada. Fog engulfed the mountain and heavy rains took our view. Today,We are back.Slim Jim and his new companion Coonhound Buddy have already spent a night out in Hot Springs along the French Broad River. The soothing waters cooled their feet after a 5 miles walk into town from the Lovers Leap side. It was a hot day compared to normal temps this time of year. Buddy eagerly tried to make friends though out the night sounding off his high yonder yodel for all the town to hear. Finally Jim had to corral him in the car for the rest of the night. Wonder how that night’s sleep went?Captain and I rolled into town Friday morning a good hour ahead of time. Shortcut drove in from Pisgah NC shortly after. It was good to have us 3 Amigos back together again. Been along time since Maine. Adding Slim Jim to the mix just put the right spice in the mix. Not to mention Buddy. Wild Bill our shuttle up to Max Patch was quite the character. Opening the back of his dusty old Jeep I began to wonder how all our packs, people and 1 dog were gonna make this sardine can ride. I quickly get my stuff in and call shot-gun. Front seat for this gal, gonna be an hour drive on some curvy road and I sure don’t want to be wearing my mornings breakfast for the weekend. Buddy made quick friends with Shortcut and Captain in the back while riding on Jim’s lap. Long legs, wet snout and Buddy balls were in every ones face at least 2 to three times. A yodel every now and again at a passing truck with other coonhounds on their way for a hunt made for an exciting ride. Back to Wild Bill…he is a search and rescue man having worked on the trail not only around here but out west too. He fought fire and built trail. He also takes care of a dear friend, an army vet and is surely a fixture around town. Dropping us off at the trail he handed each of us his business card…Wild Bill’s Shuttle and Search..”call me anytime” We don’t plan on using you again to next trip Bill. Thanks for the ride. Max Patch is an open field which has a walking trail around its perimeter which we took to hook up to the AT. Lots of day hikers out enjoying the view some even camped on top. NICE. Shortcut and Captain point out the Smokies, Snowbird Mtn etc. Snapping photos I’m lovin’ this trip already. Whoa Buddy Whoa, strapped onto Jim’s pack belts he’s pulling Jimbo like mad. Guess who will be in the leading today? Onward puppy dog….I’ve learned now to never follow two men and a dog when females are approaching. You know that small print on a side mirror…images in this view may be larger than they appear? Or is it closer than they may appear? Either way Buddy and the boys were blinded by beauty and boobs. Missing the turn marked on the trail they were leading me right for the women. I even looked back to check for marks but had gone too far with them to see the blazes. Shortcut hollers out to us. I hear it but the boys are pulled like magnets, nothing more they could do. LOL Getting back on track we soon arrive to Roaring Fork Shelter, a good lunch stop. Even though we just got on the trail it has been a long time since breakfast and we are at the noon time hour. This will be a short mileage day for us. Not really knowing what lies ahead, relying only on trail maps and the AT Guide, getting to our camp spot is still my biggest priority. Even with this pretty day and nice temps anything can change. Water is a big concern too. We’ve already past several noted streams that have nothing but dry rock beds. Coming close to Lemon Gap our possible camp spot I notice water isn’t prevalent. Shortcut hears voices ahead and thinks the road is just over the next hill. She explores and comes back with good news. Water is running good before Walnut Mountain Shelter. Let’s trek on and stay there. Everyone is in good shape for a 1.5 miles more so why not. We have plenty of daylight. There are many hikers out both section and SOBOs. Wonder if there will be anyone staying at ‘our’ shelter tonight? We plan to tent it. Too pretty not to and I sure enjoy that part of hiking best. First we must climb Walnut Mountain. Graded Bob Peoples style we reach the water source mentioned by the other hikers with little sweat. To filter or not to filter was the question. The little professor gives us the break down of components in our water treatment drops and basic household bleach. Shortcut is a knob of knowledge when it comes to science her field of study. My experience has been if it runs over at least 3 rocks and above pasture lands it good to go. Cresting the mountain we have a slight view out with the shelter just below on the other side in a gap. It’s a small old structure sleeping only 5. We scout for flat tent spots and find a cluster just right for our little group. A hiker comes in while we prepare our houses. He is from Vinton southbound for Springer. Starting July 1st at Katahdin he’s gotta make tracks if he wants to get thru the Smokies before harsher weather arrives. And with the storm approaching this coming Monday he better get truckin. His name was Stilts. A name well suited as he was 6+ feet tall and slender. Warming in the evening sun and drying out damp hiking clothes we catch up on our lives between Maine’s hike and now. Seems a short time ago and yet a long time too. We are glad to be back out and talk of maybe hiking all of Connecticut this spring. Jim joins in after getting camp water for us all and settling his child in on a lead line. Buddy hops on his rock, nose turned up to sniff out anything approaching. Yodel Yodel, two girls hike in buddy warns. They are from Raleigh headed to Hot Springs like us. Wild Bill said he had a 2:30 shuttle and this is them. Selecting camp on above us they grab the fire wood at the shelter and invite Stilts for an evening drink of wine. Over our supper we watch the sun drop and then the moon light take the forest. The brightest moon I think I’ve ever seen. I was almost able to write with out my head lamp as I lay in the tent with the rain fly open. Shortcut rustles in for bed. Jim and Buddy crawl under his tarp chatting with one another. Captain begins his purr. Smelling the girl’s campfire and feeling the light breeze on my face I watch the moon travel over our tent and drift off the sleep.","Max Patch

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395431,"9:10AMSetting on a rock watchin the fog clear not only from my surrounding but from my glasses I wait on my troops. A bit of a climb after Kale Gap toward our highest point of this trip- Bluff Mtn.A clear moonlit night led to some blown in fog this morning. Captain’s tent slept well. Roomy enough but with little head room I’m still adjusting to it. Buddy was a good dog making only lapping noises while getting some water. His collar dingled to let us know he was still about. Jim had a mat and sleeping bag for him. Such a good master.This morning Shortcut and Captain pulled out first wanting to get a jump start on us younger two. Jim will be along a little later. He cooked a warm breakfast and was still breaking his camp when I got started. Trust me with Buddy in the lead he’ll catch us at the top. Catching up to Captain I soon get sight of Shortcut. Each walking their own hike - me in fast pursuit. Here I am between the senior citizens plugging along. I laugh to myself. Sure hope I’m doing this at their ages. 68 and a cool 65.This summit is 4686 feet, a 1000 foot climb. We sure are glad we put the climb over Walnut Mtn behind us yesterday. The plan is to make Deer Park Shelter for a 9.9 mile day. We could push on to town but why rush the weekend away. Shortcut and I have a rest here. Jim arrives with pack straps rubbed into his shoulders from his load. A charging coon dog has given him quite the work out. Captain said they blew by him with Jim calling out “Mush, Mush”. 4 miles to Garenflo Gap and it’s all down hill folks. Let’s do lunch there and then we’ll only have 3.4 to the shelter. Down hill it was. Graded again nicely but by the time we reached the bottom our legs feel like jello. Temps are turning colder too. Once you stop and the sweat begins to dry better get those layers on or you’ll get chilled quick. Shortcut and I arrive first and find a little row of pine trees to set under just off the trail for others to pass. A couple comes with their beagle dog for a short hike to the shelter and back. She informs us she used to maintain this section. Jim and Buddy arrive about now too and the dogs sorta greet. Captain is along a good bit after. The down is harder on him than the up today. Being careful not to slip he takes his time. We all discuss the plan for the shelter or not. Jim has decided he may just push for town. Get his companion off the trail since it could be a wet night and sheltering with a dog would be quite hard especially if we have more than just us 4. Deer Park only holds 5. Built in 1938 by the CCC it has little accommodations. Remember the girls are behind us too. Shortcut is chilled and gets to moving and also ponders the push to town but the shelter will be a meeting point to discuss. Captain and I are for sure staying at Deer Park. I give him the last of a reserve water bottle keeping my platypus water for me. We confirm eta to the shelter and all set out. A chill is in the air and the fog has really moved in dropping temps. It is still comfortable walking. The trail skirts the mountain veering from the old route over Lamb Knob. We are all glad of that. Jim has pasted Shortcut and says he will stop for a warm bite at the shelter and then head to town. I reach her shortly after with Captain behind us. I did notice the place we thought about camping at Little Bottom Branch Gap wasn’t a good tent spot and no water. Besides a shelter named Deer Park better have a good source. Maybe we’ll build a fire if woods are good and not in a tunnel of rhodies. Closing in to the shelter we see no fire will be a possibility. Not only are we in the thick of rhododendrons the forest is not pretty damp from the fog draped over us. Too wet. First we’ll get our bunks layed out and get water. The source isn’t great but we gather 2 liters to filter when Captain arrives. He hopes to come in about 4:30 it’s 2:30 now. I decide not to get totally comfortable for the evening and out of trail clothes till he arrives. We might need more water. Us girls chat while looking out of the shelter as the weather lightens. Captain appears out of the woods 3:30. Smiling he says surprise and puts his bunk between the ladies. No Jim. He has blown by the shelter and hit town about now. The beagle and Buddy didn’t make a good match so he kept trucking. I filter our gathered water and us girls go to retrieve more so we can drink freely and cook. Yes our Captain… your maidens have your water. Have some hot tea. Captain has already shimmied into his cocoon sleeping system, his mat strapped on this sleeping bag, head only popping out to make comments. Heck this man as he says will die at age 147 probably at the hands of a jealous 18 year’s old husband!!! We have the shelter to ourselves let the trash talk begin. Cooking suppers while my seniors chuckle in the back ground I pass out a little fire water to share. I do believe it warmed us up and enlightened the conversation. Shit is made them little bossy. Here wash my cook pot, fill up my water, hang bear bag. What am I a slave? Well it’s better than the alternative. I could be out here by my lonesome. Here let me tuck you in. Do you need another pillow? How about a chocolate?After my chores I nestle down in my bag as well. Darkness falls and we listen to the water droplets pop off the tin roof. A mouse scampers over my head area. A tap dancing mouse. It’s Mr. Jingles. He sure can do it. Hope he stays right were he’s at. My mind runs wild. Captain gives us his good night toot toot and we fall asleep in laughter.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395433,"Early to bed and early to rise. Let’s knock out this last 3.2 miles and get into a warm building for some breakfast. Hot Springs here we come.A good night’s sleep except for my little mouse and few aches in my hips I’m ready to go. My pack weights little to nothing. Starting off with 21 pounds I’m guessing it’s at like 15 now. It’s suppose to be all down hill from here. Yeah right!!! Captain jumps out first on us while we elect to eat breakfast before we leave. He’s on a mission to beat us and eats on the go. Well little did he know, nor did I, that a few little puds stand in our way to the valley. He pushed on the up and kept pace on the flat getting quite the lead. We met a SOBO and says he 2 minutes in front of us. Last night I confirmed that Jim and Buddy made it to town just fine and were downing McNuggets in a warm car. On our water run the second time the girls came down the trail and were town bound too. A young gal also game along day hiking our whole trip, 21 miles in 7 or so hours. Go girl go. Now it’s us after Captain and he hootie hoots at us. I see the town Shortcut. Smokie Mountain Restaurant here we come. More SOBO’s come into the woods as we emerge into onto the street. Are they sure? The weather isn’t good coming in. Heavy skies almost haunt the area. Sure glad we are here. Wearing our pumpkin orange hats Slim Jim made we make our mark in Hot Springs. Feels good to knock off another section of the trail. Wild Bill get that jeep gassed up. We’ll be back for the next section.","Deer Park Mtn Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395946,"There are many miles along the AT, some include side trails, some are easy miles and some are long hard miles and then….well…you got yourself some Martha Miles. Yep them’s the best kind cause you get a surprise every time ;o)Andy Lane trail is our starting and finishing point today. Its a side trail which hooks up to the AT and is named after a fella who maintained this section for many years. Bonnie and I have hiked it at least a dozen or more times and plan to introduce it and Tinker Cliffs to our newbie’s. TJ and Anna are excited about hiking new ground and I love leading the way.It’s a perfect day for hiking or anything outdoors for that matter. Clear skies and warmth in the air. Gonna be a shortsleeve kinda day. The kids are dressed in layers in preparation after last hike up Kelly’s knob and they froze. Their little book-bag backpack is quite stuffed and they take turns carrying it. An easy trail to start we meander along Tinker Creek and thru the cattle fields crossing the stiles. Time to grab another gear folks let the climbing begin. How far to the top Anna asked? I wonder if she feels she can charge up it like Kelly’s knob? I lead us at a pretty good pace and no one seems to wanna pass. Just gasps and sticks digging in for more traction. TJ thinks sticks would be a good addition to their gear and Anna asks where and what type pack she might ask Santa to bring her. We meet one couple and their dog coming out on our way up. They had spent the night over past Tinker Cliffs. By the end of the day loads are coming in last minute and with dogs. Sure hope they realize night falls quicker this time of year. Reaching our junction to the AT and scorched earth gap we have a snack while I explain the plan for the day. From this point we will take the AT over Tinker Cliffs, cut off on a side trail and loop back around to where we stand right now. From memory I thought this was like 9 miles for the day but after double checking my signs and some quick calculations turns out we got ourselves some Maatha Miles. 11 I do believe. I say nothing to clue in my followers. Bonnie’s reading the signs while TJ and Anna explore the junction rock with not a care in this world. Ok let’s roll folks.We’ve told Jeff we should be done by 2:00 and will meet him at Ironto for Italian food. All the while in the back of my mind I’m thinking we gotta scoot to make that happen with an extra 2 miles added into our day. Never mind that, let’s enjoy our climb over the cliff.Bonnie and I show off the views to Peaks of Otter and Carvins Cove. TJ is excited about the rock formations and ponders a way to navigate. There’s McAfee Knob and if we keep walking the AT we would reach it. Maybe next trip. Today is the loop.Our highlight reel shall reveal our photo shot of the day. Gather in right here guys this will make a nice shot. I’ll set up the camera over on this ledge and run back to be in the picture. Yea right! I see you with that puzzled look. Did I make it? I set the camera for 10 seconds, the max time by the way, ready- set- GO! Galloping like an over weight deer I dart down the trail, I gotta make this turn up ahead, shit I ain’t gonna make it. SNAP. I’m caught mid-stride showing off my speed. TJ steps up to the plate for his shot at this accomplishment. He sets the camera – GO- GONE- he’s here and we’re waiting on the snap, NOTHING. Crap he didn’t push the button. Trying again he readies himself and GO. WOO don’t miss the turn, leaping over shrubs he clears the ledge and slips in just in the nick of time. CHEESE. Gotta love it!!!Ok down to hiking guys. I know we have Martha Miles to go before we rest. Off the cliffs we go embellishing our moment and laugh while wading thru the leaves on the trail. Don’t fall Bonnie we’ll never find you. Up to our calves in places we stump toes and trip over hidden objects beneath. Now at Brickey Gap it’s time to turn left and hit the loop back to Scorched Earth Gap. How far is THIS trail they ask? How long will it take? Hell at this point I’m afraid to give any definite response so I stammer and stutter so nothing is really heard. We set down in the field below the old hunter’s cabin which now has signs of hunter activity. A truck and big tent are here but no signs of life. They must be four wheeling. Finishing lunch, its 12:30 now no way we’ll be done at 2:00 Bonnie says. Hummm???Shuush, don’t say anything but I intend to walk a little faster maybe they won’t notice.This side trail is just that, the side of the mountain, nothing special. Just a walk in the woods and on a blue blazed trail not really blazed that well. I’ve been on it 3 times now so have a feel for where the turns are so not really worried about missing a blaze. BUT I can feel the kids breathing down my neck not wanting to get far off my steps. Bonnie is just a bit behind and I check periodically to make sure I see her purple shirt. In about 30 minutes we are back on the AT below Lambert’s Meadow Shelter. Wow that didn’t take long. 1:30ish, we have 4 miles to go. 1 LONG mile up this grade. It’s warming up too. Not a breath of fresh air. I try to make conversation to keep our minds off the distance. It just keeps growing. The blazes keep appearing yet no summit. Where’s the rock? I push them. Anna finally calls it and asks for a break and some water. TJ’s been carrying the pack and ready to make the hand off. Bonnie? Where’s Bonnie? Tired and dejected and ready to kick my ass she appears. Martha Miles, damn Martha Miles. I see it, I see it, the Rock. The kids run for a set down.Heading back down Andy Lane it feels like yesterday since we were just here. TJ asks “could you do it all over again tomorrow?” You bet I could. Anna and Bonnie confer, only if they didn’t have to work. Talk of next time hikes and maybe some BIG hike in the spring continues. “Can we come on the Connecticut trip?” Ahh Haa I haven’t killed their spirit. I smile. I sure am happy I introduced them to Maatha Miles oh and the AT.Just to let you know we did make it out but at 3:00. Jeff met us for that good Italian meal too.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/396176,"I’ve said at least a dozen times you never know what the trail will bring you. You can repeat a section and it will look different every time. The path may lead to the same destination but along its way you’ll meet new people, with new sights and sounds. Today we heard and saw them all so to speak.Just me and the kids today for a ‘quick’ hike. Just 7 miles ya know. New signs are posted along the way. Right off the bat the first one says 3.9 to McAfee Knob. I know they haven’t re-routed from the most recent work. Looks like we’ll have another day of ‘extra’ miles guys. They chuckle.We are some of the first out today. A few cars in the lot. Most will come as we descend later I am sure. Money plant and a few sprouts of field grass line the morning path. Graded nicely all the way to the top now we will make good time for this ‘shorter’ hike. Again the kids have dressed in layers. TJ even has his long johns on under his skinny jeans. I’m guessing he has about 2 jackets on over his flannel shirt. A small fellow he doesn’t expel much energy on our hikes, barely breaking a sweat I assume. Anna sports her Yukon Charlie hat. Fur comes out over each ear with tie flaps. Me, I’m in my trail shorts and two a couple light layered shirts. The air is just cool enough to keep one long sleeve on all day. Talk is of what they can expect in CT if they go on that trip with us. What do we wear? Will we see a lot of people? Camping? Gear? You name it they need it. I assure them between The Captain and myself we can get they thru but they will need to invest in some good trail shoes, socks etc. Anna has already put a new pack on your Santa’s wish list. Passing by the Boy Scout shelter a few hikers are still camped from the night before. Hammock still full and tent zipped tight. McAfee shelter has activity too as hikers leave out just before we approach. A whole group of college kids are up ahead as well climbing up on a downed tree fallen above the trail. We pass right under them. See ya at the top!The kids are surprised at how their stamina is different than last week. I do believe that last LONG mile up got to them and since today’s grade is quite easy they feel strong and ready to keep hiking on to Tinker Cliffs. I know I do. Reaching the top several groups are posing for the grand McAfee ledge shot. I inform Anna she has just about completed the triple crown of the AT having summited all 3 noted rock outcrops in VA – Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee, Tinker Cliffs. Now you just have to hike those connecting ridges. Can we do that next week? TJ stares out over Catawba Valley.After getting our perfect photo like all the others we pick a sunny spot on out on the rocks for a set down and lunch. “Hey Dude with the awesome beard” a girl calls out. Take our picture. TJ’s new trail name is born. We can see where we just were last week, Tinker Cliffs off in the distance. 10 miles hike from here I say. Questions roll out again about a week’s long hike and preparation. I could have talked about it all day but we must get on back. Besides it’s starting to get crowded up here. Almost all the hikers we met thus far are camping tonight. Big packs and all headed for the other side of the mountain. There is the Hog Pen Gap for camping, a shelter and then Lamberts Meadow all the way over toward Tinker Mtn. I’m already starting to count hikers and it doesn’t jive there will be enough room. As we begin to descend more and more hikers we meet. Groups of 7 to 10, dads and sons, Buddies and Babes. Wow I like the minority. Everyone has an overnight pack. Not but a few of us day trippers out. Even the little tikes are totin’. I begin asking every group where camp is for the night. All said ‘the other side of the McAfee’. Wow gonna be grand central over there. Chatting with a young one I get a good comment…Where’s the nearest fountain? Then a fellow carrying what looked like a small mattress on his back for a pack was asked if he had a small child in there. Nope that’s where I carry my oriental women, she’s gonna cook for us tonight. We cracked up. Another guy carries a gallon jug of water in addition to his gear. More and more hikers come into the woods. How many? I’d say 80 and that’s not a stretch. Glad we are going this-a-way. Soon we are to the bottom, parking lot is getting full. A warm day has brought everyone out. TJ is ready to shed them johns. (Yes he did come out of his coats and so did Anna with her hat along the way) Holding his tiny pants up for all to see I have him pegged again for yet his REAL trail name…Tiny Pants. Those are the tiniest pants man. I couldn’t have fit over my arm without loss of circulation. A big bearded grin comes on his face. You see you just never know what the trail will bring. Loads of new faces, new experiences and 2 new trail names.","Rt. 311

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/396742,"It’s December and way too warm to hike. No just kidding. A warm day it was, still a bite in the morning air and some frost on the ground when we hit the trail. Johnny Knob Knocker has made it back with us. The kids beat me here to the parking lot eager to go.What no creek? Not a drop of water in the side branch as we head into the woods. Usually we cross water about 3 times before leaving the gap and make our push up Peter’s Mountain. This worries me. Soo dry so soon. We need rain, snow, something wet from the skies. But just not today….I picked up Johnny’s pack at the start…hummm does he have sand in there again? “I’ve got extra Gatorade” he says announcing the source of his weighted down pack. The straps cut into his down jacket popping up the shoulders like a linebackers. Tiny Pants and Anna take turns carrying their community pack and alternate hiking stick use. Leading our way I start informing John of our upcoming BIG hikes hoping he might be able to join us. He has already been in search of a tent. Of course you can always fall back on our best resource for hiking gear….THE CAPTAIN. A gear whore, you’ll always get what you pay for. The steam stacks of Celanese below us have filled the air with a stinging aroma. Anna covers her nose, this can’t be healthy. And with us gasping for extra air into our lungs on the climb we inhale it all. Yuke!Soon we are strategically stone stepping along the edge of the slope and have worked up a sweat. I’m in shorts already and glad of it. Gloves to start but on no more. John finally comes out of that down and is wet underneath. Two hikers approach. They have camped at the water source just before the crest of the mountain. Weekenders headed for town now. We come to that camping spot and are just about to the top ourselves. I’m guessing it will be colder once we crest and tell them about last year’s ice hike I ended up in last January. Hoar frost 3 inches thick that day and wind wind. Today it’s clear, sunny and cool. Some wispy clouds holding the temps down some. Say do you have any bungee cords in there Martha? John asks. Humm nope but I do have this shock cord on my pack. What’s up? Not my pants he says. He’s about to pull a Marilyn Monroe Captain Style if he doesn’t get something around his waste to hold his drawers up. Yep them Gatorade bottles have shoved the pants down over his so called hips just about giving the kiddies a giggle. The wind is blowin now cooling us all off quickly on this stop and synch so let’s get trekking folks.3 miles of ridge walking along the WVA/VA line and we come to the open fields. Nice. TJ is in awe. What’s that town below? Keep walking this path and you’ll come to Captain’s house I say. Some maintenance has been done to our normal viewing spot. Shrubs cut to the ground and undergrowth removed. Still a little too windy to set here for lunch so we retreat to the shelter. Wool hats go on and jackets while we eat. “I didn’t know the shelters had power” Anna says. They don’t. Some wise acre has put in a double wall socket along with power cord to look real. John and I look out the back side of the shelter to confirm the joke and have to laugh. Free Power!! Over lunch John shows us a new rain poncho/tarp cover he has purchased. Covers everything well (pack and himself) but how do you secure for camping? Jim/Captain a lesson in tarp tenting is gonna be needed. Heading back the way we came, John takes the tail end spot putting the kids up with me. You afraid of loosing your pants? No you lead a mean pace. It’s them kids, they’re pushing me man. Before we know it we’re back at the sharp turn off Peter’s mountain and headed for the 2 miles of down. John falls behind a tad just to take care of his steps and not turn an ankle. TJ asks where he is and I assure him he’ll catch us before we finish. Anna’s using her sticks like a natural now while TJ is loaded for bear with that little pack stuffed to the seams. “You can carry your own stuff Anna and I’ll carry mine” he barks after taking another piece of clothing from her to add in. Load him down girl, it might slow him as he looks for vines to swing from and rocks to leap to and from. My arms are really getting a good workout on this down. Wrists pressed to hyper- extension to hold myself back and take the pressure off my knees. I’m ready to get off these rocks and back down to the so called creek and Celanese air. Sure enough John is back up with us as we approach our finish. Where’s the next hike the kids inquire. I didn’t get to go on the Dragon’s Tooth hike TJ informs. The hiking bug has bit. Not wanting to miss a section I sure wouldn’t want to disappoint.

I know they are grown kids butt….. Even though we all didn’t feel the best this morning it didn’t stop us from getting outdoors. The excitement of taking Tiny Pants to the Tooth was what the day was all about. We approached the tooth from the longest side hiking north just like the thru hikers would experience. It’s a 5.4 mile up for the morning but having just enough switchbacks and plateau sections to catch your wind. We dropped a car on the south side off Rt. 624 on the way over.Since we just hiked this a month ago (opposite direction) I pretty much recited the proximity of our location the whole day. The shelter is here and the poplar grove is up ahead, we’ll be at the crest soon and so on. Anna was curious just how I knew how far along we are. Well we usually hike about 2 miles an hour including lunch stops and ups and downs. If we get a good stretch of flat lands we can push 3. TJ is sure we did more miles in an hour last week at the Rice Fields and he was right. Cookin baby!!We did run across a little Christmas on the trail today just before the grove of poplars. I little red teddy bear was placed up in a break of a fallen tree just shy of the shelter sign. Quite noticeable on this somewhat grey day. It’s still unseasonably warm this time of year. A chance of rain was forecasted so I brought extra rain jackets for my little hikers just in case. Once we reached the ridge line it was time for a break and a chance to see out. A big rock provided a nice photo op. How far are we? Oh about 2ish miles in Anna. Once we reach the tooth it’s only 2.5 to the car. Wow that’s short, an easy hike she proclaims. From here we have views on both sides of the ridge walking thru some patchy rock covered trail. To your left is McAfee way off I point. Audie Murphy monument is behind us. We’ll go there soon. They both are wanting map to mark off trail done and see those to do. Watch out for these leaves they just keep getting deeper and deeper. It was like slow motion then FAST, Lead Dog is down. Yep right foot went out as the trail disappeared in the leaves and crash… down on my left knee. A rock raced close up to my face as I caught myself. That’s what happens when you’re not looking and leading the guided tour I laugh. By the way get ready to hit granny low here’s where the climb really begins.Rock steps, twists of the trail around trees and ledges… we’ll be to the top in no time. See there, the pines, that’s where the tooth is. Them kids are like ok. Cool. We there already?? HA I think they could have kept walking to Maine. The new sign at the junction sure made it seem that easy. The Roanoke Trail Crew has put in a nice sign showing YOU ARE HERE, Dragon’s Tooth there, Trout Creek here, AT this way, and Maine looked to be just around the corner. Too funny!Now here is were my nerves about left my body. Anna shows TJ the way thru the rock shoot to access the top of Dragon’s Tooth. This ginormous rock formation stands above the trail like a leaning Empire State Building and the kids are scrambling straight to the tippy top. STOP don’t you go…., too late. TJ’s on the edge with Anna right behind him. Me, well I’m at my normal height limit of midway where there’s a nice wide section of somewhat flat area to set and look out. No way will I ever get to the tippy top. Ya’ll keep talking up there so I know you’re still there. I can’t see them…McAfee stands in the distant haze with the valley stretched out magnificently. Above our tree line we are truly on top of the world. After getting our fill it’s time to move along so the next group of hikers can have there time up here. Easy Easy, scoot down on your butts…AHHH they are making me nervous. Sweet relief once I get them down to normal ground. We find a nice spot for lunch. Never a dull moment with these two. An orange “ball” comes bouncing over my shoulder. CATCH IT! It bounds off a rock past my reach and gone down the hill side like lost boulder from an avalanche. That’s my lunch, my orange. TJ instructs Anna to put the rest of his meal in a safer location, that he doesn’t want to go hungry today. We all hope it didn’t catch enough speed to crash a car on the road way below.Time for the walk off kidos. Ya’ll wanna lead? I know they’ll be waiting on this old lady and her knees to navigate this 2.5 miles of rock steps safely. They elect to stay behind and take note of my path. Every now and again I hear them jumping off what I scoot down on my butt. Easy guys no twisted ankles now. Some other hikers are coming up now and they are bushed. One gal red faces like our SandraD is setting taking a rest and her boyfriend winded with her. Ya’ll ok I ask. A meek yes comes out. Hope they make it. So you kids think you could hike this with overnight packs? Sure, we’d sure try they say. Maybe you’ll get to experience trail magic some day. What’s that? That’s when something you are wishing for just appears on the trail. Or something you need happens to be provided. A cooler of goodies, a ride to town, a helping hand. They are excited about getting some of that. In good time, In good time. You just keep following ol Lead Dog and you’ll see…","Trout Creek

Oh then you should have been with our gang today for some kind of adventure.It was like herding cats to get us on the road to start. I figured meeting at our house about 9:30am would give all time to get up and get going…Larry included. What was I thinking? From We’re passing Wades to who’s driving with who, Oh can you pick me up at the airport…. Once on the road in 2 cars, 1 hauling the girls and 1 the boys, nothing doing that we have to stop for gas and goodies. Larry what’s that healthy selection you’ve chosen for your truck of comrades? Donuts baby!!! Finally out of the town limits we are bound for Damascus for a day of gear shopping for TJ and Anna. Packs are on the main agenda and what ever else we can squeeze from mama’s debit card. But first we must pick up Harry. Yes the Straggler is flying over from Bluefield and landing at the Mountain Empire Airport in Rural Retreat. You can see the runway from the interstate heading south between Wytheville and Groseclose Exits. Once loaded again the head count is Boys 5 – Jeff, Larry, TJ, The Captain, Harry. Girls 4- Bonnie, Me, Anna, Regina(mom). Look out MRO here we come. (that’s the outfitter store in Damascus we are headed for). I called ahead to warn them we are coming today. Steve and Dave await our arrival.We entered the store scattering about like unleashed dogs in a race. Where’s the bathroom? Here’s the packs! Look a SOBO hiker! Sale rack! Piles started to form on the check out counters and pack measurements began. Twinkle Twinkle their eyes light up. I like green, this one is perfect. Steve has them loaded with sandbags to fill out the pack for trial and fit. SOLD. CaChing!!!Now for some browsing, Harry’s snuggled down in a sleeping bag for a test run. I’m chatting with Silly Goose about his southern trip and his 15 days in the rain in Sept. He’s resupplying and trying to get home for the holidays. Family to meet him in a week. Bonnie has a load of clothes and Captain and Larry are chatting gear. Who’s hungry? Dot’s it is. We’ve been in here for like 2 ½ hours. I’ve never eatin at Dot’s, a hiker/townie bar, but a cheeseburger and a beer sure sounds good. Order up. Now fully fortified let’s see what Sundog Outfitter across the road has to offer. Yep some purchases made here too. Where to next? Abingdon for a bike shop for Captain and then we better get on home. Here’s where things get some spice. See we have to drop Harry at the airport and conversation comes about of the kids taking a ride sometime with him. Nothing doing but Harry taking them up on it now. No time like the present. All aboard.Up they go bound for the Dublin Airport where we’ll pick them up. But first a stop at Wytheville at another bike shop for Jeff. Wow this day is getting stretched on. Guess I know now how those Martha Miles feel huh?! Shop till ya drop or your card runs out. We gather at Dublin, dusk setting in. Where’s my kids mom says? Regina sends a text out. We’re coming in Hot Anna replies. There they are a speck among the clouds. I hear the plane engine. Bark Bark the tires of the Mooney hit the runway. They are safely down. Thumbs up and feet on the ground. Thanks for trusting me with your kiddos mom, nice to have met you, Harry says.You just never know where Lead Dog’s pack will take you.

World spinnin and your about to pass out….and then….huhhh I think I might…..ahhhh…..Well here we are out to have some fun. Yes fun. I’m sure you couldn’t tell by this intro but…fun. Share time with friends. Enjoy nature and whatever adventure that might lie ahead. I’m excited about bringing Skyla, my step-daughter, out to hike with us today. Harry is in and TJ is ready to go. I’ve prepared for her to have a great time. Clothed her in warm gear and provided hiking sticks. I’ll carry the pack and supplies, you just follow me.Our plan is to hike up to Angels Rest and then on to the next overlook take a break then hike on to a powerline and retrace our steps for a nice round 8 mile trip. It’s a cold seasonable Giles County day. Snow can be seen on the ridge tops. Perfect. Leading as Lead dog does I’m out of the gate like a whipped race horse charging up the initial slope of the trail. Skyla right behind with the boys following. I’m chattering about this and that and Harry tells us of the snowboarding week at Snowshoe. We are in a little snow now ourselves. A good skiff on the ground making traction a tad tedious. Better take a break so Skyla can get some water. “I don’t feel so good” Her face white as a sheet but flush on her neck. Here take off this fleece, open the top of your hat. Weee the world goes round and round. Easy girl. Have some water. We give her some projectile room just in case. Harry and TJ gather in a safe distance. Yep I have about killed my girl. I had a coach in AAU basketball that would run us ragged and say Push it.. Push it. Push it Girls, Push it. I’ve turned in to that awful coach. Sorry Sky. Oh and by the way you got a new trail name…Cookies!!! ;o)After a little regrouping and realigning of who’s following who we are off. Harry takes our lead, TJ and then I follow in behind Skyla. She struggles to make it. Her stride no more then a half step at a time. “You go on ahead Martha…I need Captain” He’d hang back with me. I’m the worse hiker ever she says with a little chuckle. Glad she can laugh about it. Slow and steady wins the race she announces. By the way how far to the top?Progressing on, the snow increases under foot. Glad we have sticks. TJ is without but at this pace he doesn’t seem phased but does comment coming down he might just take the lead by way of butt sliding. Harry got us to the first stop, Angels Rest and none too soon. TJ and I felt like we’d been hiking days and gone now where….we’ll we have only come 1.7 miles. Skyla looks at the sign and says are we done? Not quite baby let’s check out the overlook so to take your mind off it all.Wow that’s the town of Pearisburg. I can see Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut. Every hikers dream to walk right off the trail into town for pizza and ice cream. We don’t tarry to long we are already starting to cool down and I’d better get this train rollin again if we are to make it that 8 miles. NOT. I have already conceded in my mind that would not work. Let’s just head up the 0.6 miles to Wilburn Ridge Overlook and then maybe just get in another mile. The snow is now drifted in places over our shoe tops but we make it just fine. Tj is loving it even in his cloth sneakers. We find a warm spot in the sun and have a snack and rest. Here have some Noni oranges. We didn’t have those holiday goodies like pumpkin roll she used to pack this time of year but we did have some Florida red oranges to devour. Heaven. Skyla is all smiles now. She has conquered the mountain and feeling much better sucking down a bottle of water like no tomorrow. You have another in there right? Boy do I have some hiker training to do with this one. Getting in that last bit more of trail it’s time to about face and head back down. Hold on to your sticks and take is easy. Man Down, TJ’s on his backside. Watch these rocks. I’m off in front once again with Harry sliding right behind. Half way down I hear another man go down or should I say woman. Say can you straighten this stick she says? No worries Cookies I’ll get the outfitter to fix it. Coming out of the snow the trail turn bare and crispy still frozen under foot. Hard footing but fast walking. Watch your step, bam she’s down again. I’m ok I’m ok. Just glad to be out and on pavement. We have reached the road we parked on. The guys help her to her feet. “I’ve made it, that was hard but I’ve made it!” she exclaims. It was good to see her smile and share her with my hiking friends.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/397793,"I just love taking folks to new ground, connecting the dots, picking up where they left off last and seeing where the next section of the AT might lead. I looked forward to finding the monument my first time, it wasn't marked on the AT maps like it is now nor was there even a trail sign to say turn here. Just a faint blue blaze that I walked past. Who was Audie Murphy anyways? And why put a monument on top of a mountain that most can't even access without some trail walking?We met at Craig's Creek this morning for our car pools. Boys in one rig and girls in another. Captain has a new black truck, a real people hauler. We'll leave his at Trout Creek our finish and then all load up in mine to start our hike just below Niday shelter and hike up the steepest side of the mountain first. Imagine that!! It is a cold winter morning after a clear night. Everyone is wrapped up pretty good. Glad there is no wind to contend with. We'll have a mile or so walk along the bottom lands before we hit the base of the mountain so no real exsurtion to warm up quick unlike our last hike. Sorry Sklya. Anna is catching up with me on that hike and asking when we will hit 'the hard part'. 3.7 miles to the monument the sign says...so about another mile or so and you'll know it. Crossing a few foot bridges and winding around the foot of the mountain there is some signs of remaining snow or should I say frozen snow. Melting and refreezing has caused the shady spots to be rock solid. Not deep but just enough to make footing tricky. Nope didn't bring my yak traks but they WILL go on the pack for next trip for sure. The leaves provided just enough substance to allow traction without slipping. Soon talk turns to the CT trip in the spring. We plan to see that other big oak along the trail, The Dover Oak. They say IT's the biggest tree on the AT, while our Keffer Oak is noted for the largest BLAZED tree on the AT. I wanna see for myself. So your all about bigger say Martha? Yepper Johnny.. And I say down South we go it..bigger!! Captain and John hang together while Anna and I lead the way. ""Sure glad you are along Anna, gives Martha a taste of her own medicine"" Captain points out. She needs a good dose. She is all proud of her new pack and trying to fill it up with 'stuff'. Don't get ahead of yourself, it will fill up quick enough when you pack for a week's trek. Her new red rabbit hat, that new green pack and purple socks set quite the trail fashion. I did worry about her feet getting cold today and possible wet with snow. So far so good. She still sports her everyday tennie shoes with perfect big toe toenail holes in each shoe. Ascending each switchback the trail gets a bit steeper as we go. Graded just enough to keep us from slidding back on those icie spots. Sure glad we are going up instead of going down. I gotta shed another layer and get out of this wool hat and gloves. Sunshines between the whispy cloud cover and keeps warming things up. However we are now coming into the shady spots and true northside of the mountain. Yikes no grip, sticks don't even penitrate the frozen snow. Where did our leaves go? Careful, careful Anna. Down she goes..Nothing hurt. We teadiously step and finally creast the gap to where I know a park bench awaits. We gals will hold up here for the boys to meet up with us. Guessing they might be 20 minutes behind us I deside to take a trip behind some brush for a much needed rest stop. Sure hope no one is coming down this forest road or they might get to see a full moon. I hear voices, Anna talks to her grandmother by cell phone nd then I see other people approaching and a dog. Wew I just did get finished in the nick of time. This family has come in from the forest road parking at the top of the mountain and walked out to the monument and back. They say about a 2 mile walk out from where they parked. The boys arrive.Captain is ready for a set down and get some nurishment. Being on a stict diet only apples and cheese are on the menu. Say when's the last time you took a good shit? About a week he says. We all laugh. Guess when you do the weigh in that number will be double digits dude. He is loosing weight to get ready for our trip. The guys too took their time over the icie sections with extra caution not to fall. While Captain takes a load off I take the others on up to the monument since they are anxious to see for the first time. There are two benches here as well making it a nice lunch stop. They just put in the second one along with new flag pole too. A nice touch with the this large granite fixture in the middle of nowhere. Stones have been placed high around it as people have put their own tokens of appreciation on it. Badges, flowers, notes, momentos. Audie was the most decorated WWII veteran, born in Texas. Etchings tell more about his specific medals and how he died in a plane crash not far from this site. Just as I finish reading a plane sound is heard above. Could it be? No it couldn't....the ghost of Audie Murphy??? I flyies over several times and we finally see the plane. Not sure who you are up there, all I know is you ain't our Harry, the tail fine isn't turned just right...hahaha Finishing our lunch the Captain comes blistering down the trail. He waves saying catch me if you can. I just love a challenge. We take our time snapping some photos and giving him a little more cushion. With the snow and down hill coming up I know we'll over run him in about 10 to 15 minutes. Anna is already calcuating our approach. Walking on the ridge for just a bit more will be our last chance to see out with much of a view. McAfee Knob can be seen way off in the distance and I try to find the exact spot of Dragon's Tooth to point out. One things for sure that is Captain up ahead. He's already out of his big coat and sporting his trail hat instead of tobaggon. Is that him Anna says? Hootie Hoot.   We'll see ya at the car old man take your time and eat our dust or snow in this case. Johnny boy hangs with the Captain for some guy talk. Slipping off the ridge and now hitting the switchbacks on this side towards Trout Creek we run into 2 hikers and their little dog. Slickery here no doubt. We pull over to let them try to keep their uphill momentum and pass. Woop Woop one guy almost goes down holding his dog in one hand and sticks in the other. Desiding to set the pup down he manages to make it past without a fall. Now its our turn to slide down this. Sure hope Captain and John make it ok here I say. Once out of the snow it is smooth sailing. Warmer too. We chat along and before we know it I see the road, the truck is just up there. Anna spys it too. Wow that was quick. 1:35 gal. We won't see them boys for another 30 minutes. Suprise Suprise and a hootie hoot. Anna combs the woods for them. John's orange shirt appears between the trees. Then Captain's voice again and by gooley there he is. Only 15 minutes HA I made it he says. Now let's get down to some real trail stuff. What's that tree right there? What side of the mountain where the pine trees on Anna? John waits for her guess and wants a try. Oh I get quizzed too. Nothing like a hike to see some history and then a quiz to follow....","Craigs Creek Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398505,"Snow is down and my feets gotta hit the ground. I couldn’t get to the trail fast enough this weekend. With having a some what stressful last few weeks with my hubby Larry, the L-Train, Eugene Thomas, having open heart surgery I was ready for a peaceful walk in the woods. He is recovering nicely by the way. Already talking about his next hike. Yes I know your mouth dropped just like mine did. Snow measurements in the region where 7 to 12 inches. I thought heck I could make it to the crest of the Rice Fields for a heart pounding 4 mile hike. Easy drive over, walking alone I could set my own pace, and be done in time to scamper back over the New River Bridge and check out the Pearis Cemetary. The trail passes right by it just outside of town. I’d been there several years ago when connecting unfinished trail sections and am curious to see what changes have occurred since new signs have been put in place along the main road. Gators on, warmest long johns and layers check. Let’s get my hike on. The little creek running just along the path at the trail head has now become boot top deep and covered with down tree limbs making rock hopping quite tricky. I sure don’t want wet feet within 2 minutes of my trip. By the time I finish contorting like playing twister over water I’ve worked up quite the sweat. I’ve got to get out of these layers. Crossing the last of the streams I’m down to no jacket or gloves or boggin. Snow is up to my calves and the sun is shining fine on me. I picked this section knowing I’d be on the south side of the mountain and warmer than say Angels Rest tucked back in the holler and cold cold. Well it’s hot as hell now and I’ve only come a quarter of a mile. I’ll keep climbing to the first real pull up to a knob which looks over Pearisburg and its Celanese Plant. That will be a good test of how long my day will be. Step after step the snow deepens but is powdery like sugar. Kicking like thin air but my feet are heavy as cinder blocks. Wearing my boots for the first time this season is weighing me down. I love my trail runners and sure miss them but glad I didn’t try this in them. My feet would have been soaked and probably cold once stopped. Switchbacks are put in place on the trail to lessen the effort to climb a hill. Well NOT today. Every effort I have is in pushing up this knob and the more steps just add to the agony. I think I can, I think I can. Yes I did take a breather twice to climb this hill that normally takes me 20 minutes from the car. 1 HOUR today. Guess who isn’t going another step further once she reaches this top?Clearing off a nice log to set on I call home base… Lead Dog to Mamma Bear..Lead Dog to Mamma Bear…I am safe but ready to call this part of the hike a day. My mom is staying down us while Larry recovers and has given me the time to get back to work and do what I do best, hike. She is glad to hear I’m cutting it short and heading for easier trail.Celanese smoke stacks fill the air with steam white as the snow I’m walking on. Trees still hold full and heavy as I slide below them trekking off of here. I can see the US flag tall on the adjacent hill from where I’m at. It’s the cemetery flag. My plan is to grab a beverage from my car and drive over and find a spot to park so I can enter the woods down from the Rendezvous Hotel. The second part of my day.All I need is an AT sign and a blaze…just follow. I found a pull off spot close to where I thought one might be and enter the woods once again. This time it is a piece of cake. Easy walk and easy grade. Warm as toast, about 40. Then I hear a plane, is it Harry? I told him where I was going. He’s buzzing the Rice Fields. I’m over here now. Look for the flag Harry. I tie my orange bandana to my hiking stick and begin waving it to the sky. I now know how Bear Grylls feels when search and rescue can’t find him. The buzz fades and Harry is gone.Pearis Cemetary, name for the founder of Pearisburg, Captain George Pearis a revolutionary warrior. He settled on this spot just above the New River and built his home and ran the ferry. Some historians in town have researched the plots and named all they could find and noted unknown head stones. I found one grave for Lafayette Henry Thomas, who fought in the Civil War. Who knows, he may be a long lost descendent of ours. I’ll have to bring Larry back hear when he is well enough to make the trek. Lunch was pleasant under a big oak with my hot soup and snow beer. This large tree draped her arms out over these soles and me while I looked off over The New. Our nation’s flag hanging still. Calm, Peaceful, Free.","Snow Hike Pearisburg

I’ve got some companions today or should I say fools. Ya’ll just park south of the Nascar Ladies place and let’s roll.The little parking spot was full by the time we all arrived. One car even from Florida. Guess they are wishing they’d stayed home. Snow still covers the mountain sides with some grass showing thru from sun melt yesterday. This slight wind’s gonna make a difference in comfort levels for sure.No long johns for me today but could have stood them on the start. Shady areas bite with the cold breezes. No worries it’s all up for 2 miles folks so you’ll warm quick. Bonnie, Harry and I have our gators on while the kiddos layer up the best they can and have dug deep in the closets for snow shoes. TJ’s wearing his work boots and Anna has some sporty snow boots. Platform almost. Say do those things moon walk?Climbing from the car park on Rt. 42 up the field we get warm and are ready to remove some clothing at it’s crest. Hiking is much easier today, snow not as deep. Heck I could have wore my tennie shoes I do believe. I just couldn’t chance it though. Harry felt the same way. These concrete slippers just don’t cut it man.“Once we pass over this road up ahead we’ll be soon to the BIGGEST tree on the AT” I say. Muttering begins…Why in the heck didn’t we just start from here? No comment. Bonnie fills the kids in on those minor details and how THE Lead Dog works. Don’t you start too Harry. Besides I’ll tell Betty you been lookin for Whores. Just kidding. See there were these signs posted close to 2 field accesses stating NO HORSES. Well some wise acre made adjustments so it read NO WHORES. A good laugh was had.There it is, Southern Style, The Keffer Oak. One big ass tree. THE BIGGEST TREE ON THE AT. Well we’ll see come April if Virginia’s beauty matches that of the Dover Oak in NY. We will be starting our hike at NY’s Oak and knock out all the trail in Connecticut. I should have brought some rope today for measure but I’ll have time before then to do so. I’ll be sure to post results. TJ scopes out a place for a foot hold and really wants to give her a climb but just not ample place to do so. Lower branches a big as a most small tree trunks just in need of a swing to sway from. In aw they are. Now for the fun stuff, the climb to Sarver Junction. We’ve already decided no need to go down to Sarver Shelter which would add another mile to our already planned 8 mile day. Gonna feel longer anyways with tough footing. Speaking of footing, the foot prints I’ve been following have now disappeared. They made it just past the Keffer and up in the field and turned around. Humm that might be a sign. Guess I’ll just break trail.When’s lunch Anna asks? It’s only 10:30. Thought we’d get a snack if need be close to the top. Only 1.3 miles from here. Come on you slackers I holler back to the ‘old duo’. Harry says he’s telling a story and will be along shortly. I’m pretty sure it was a short story about how quick he and Bonnie we kill me when they catch me. Once again the switchbacks just keep adding steps and length to our progress. Trudging along we make turn after turn getting closer to the ridge. This north side has really kept its snow. This shall be fun coming off we all say. Anna begins to fade back while TJ pushes her along. Running out of fuel from a light breakfast she is ready for the snack break or should I say her lunch. Finding the rocks I remembered that are just below the crest we stop. Hey is this it Harry says? Is this Sarver, knowing good and well it isn’t just for grins. Anna collapses in the middle of the trail, FOOD FOOD I need FOOD gobbling down her lunchable. Guess I’ll just eat my chewy bar when you guys have your lunch later hahaha. Bonnie’s developed a slight catch in her hip and well my heel is killin me from these damn boots. What’s hurtin on you Harry? I’d say everything, we should turn around right away to save ourselves. TJ just shakes his head. The power of youth and the agony of da feet. Cresting the ridge the sunshine feels mighty fine. Wind greets us but the sun is good. 2 more mile guys and we’ll be at our junction. They all like this part and before we know it we ARE at Sarver. I tell them about old man Sarver who raised his family up here and show them the orchard and rock cairns made from picked up rocks on his land. I’ll show you the home place and cemetery another time.The return hike was just peachy. We ran into another hiker chick and her black lab. The pup was so glad to see people she leapt high like on a spring board. Pet me pet me she lapped. Hiker chick was from Craig Creek side and was hiking Sinking creek side like us for her first time. She was glad to have our foot steps to follow.Quickly we are back to our turn to descend back to 42. Bonnie’s got her Yak Traks on. Smart girl. The rest of us just take our chances. The snow is just deep enough to prevent serious sliding and just packed enough to add some falls. Anna set the tone with 2 for the day and I rounded out a good whip-out almost near the end.

Gonna be slickery.I knew it would be cold in the holler and boy was it. The deeper we drive in the greyer it becomes with the blue sky from a crisp morning barely seen above the tree tops. The parking lot is still snow covered needing some sunlight to melt it off. The kids are here early and Bonnie has come in just before Carolann and me.Stepping out of our cars we put on all we brung. Double gloves, yaks, hats and extra pants. Kids say no need for packs today too short of a hike and I confer. We’ve come on this hike in honor of our short tripper Miss Carolann, aka Gabby the City Slicker, and boy is she. Putting on her gortex pants over her other pants and trying to get her yak traks on she’s sounding off so folks down the way could surely hear. Where’s my gloves, where’s my water, I can’t feel my fingers. Here carry this. We are almost the first up the trail this morning getting run past by a family of friends and their little ones. All the tikes are excited to go and soon are out of sight. The trail is much easier walking than I imagined. Slick still on bridges with inches of frozen build up and rocks packed with snow. But the actual trail was crumbly snow, very dry. Rhododendron leaves are tucked tight to protect themselves from the deep freeze. Glad the wind isn’t blowing or we’d be done for. Look a heater, NOT. The old sawmill turban does look like a giant space heater. We try to warm our hands. Little Stony rolls ice cold beside us and we meander up the lower falls trail. I always take this path first that way we don’t have to walk around folks on the way back, coming and going. We can truck on down the upper falls trail on the way back along its fire road. It’s wide and mostly in the sun. Anna and TJ lead our way since they have not extra chains for their feet like we do. They can set the pace and let us know how slick it is before they fall. Hahaha Better them than us I say. Wooops, their goes Anna, sliding down the stairs of the bridge barely staying up right. Wooops, their goes TJ, feet up, he just disappeared from sight going down the other stairs. Careful kids. Big smiles and dusting off snow and their ready to go again. We did work up enough warmth to shed a few layers on the way and by the time we reached the falls the sun cast a few shadows around us to make us feel rather cozy. Water rushes over the fall’s ledge not quite frozen solid yet. Packed ice has built up around the bottom though. Careful don’t trust it I say. There’s a large rock area noted for the prime photo spot and getting to it in the summer takes some rock hopping with it surrounded by standing water. Today it looks frozen solid but don’t trust it!!!Strategically making our way for our picture I set up the tripod of hiking sticks and my camera, 10 seconds now, ready set go…I tip toe over rocks and then rollover the big log that’s been fallin since forever and TA-DA, CHEEZE. I got it. No sooner than we finish a large group comes in for the same thing. Careful guys this ice isn’t solid. The spokesman for the group is a large man dressed like a car salesman asking for me to photograph them. Sure but only if you go this way I direct. One by one they go and then look out, a chick crashes through after not taking the best route. Wet feet at 15 degrees isn’t good. Come on guys lets get out of here before the whole bunch goes in.Navigating the iced over the upper trail steps we make it to quieter surroundings and enjoy our stroll back to the car. Talk of Connecticut still fills our mind while Gabby wonders how in the hell we’ll ever survive. She’s our City Slicker thru and thru coming for these short hikes when theirs nothing better to do. The parking lot is now full and more coming in as we set in the warm sun waiting on the church crowd to come and go from our favorite Pembroke eatery, the New River Grill.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399305,"If you fix it He will come….and maybe more will follow. Sketti, Snow on a cold Saturday what more could we ask for. Captain fixed the sketti and Harry came to hike. Family and friends, what FUN.With winds driving us off the ridges today I planned our hike to be short and sweet with a little snow on top. Captain shuttled us from his house up the big bridge off the road below Bailey’s Gap shelter. It was hard to leave his house after getting a whiff of that yummy sauce he’s been cooking since last night. Come on Harry no lolly gagging. I think he grabbed a spoonful before we left. We’ll hike from here toward Pine Swamp shelter and get in about 4 miles today. A good workout with the snow on the ground and more coming. It’s dang cold Bonnie says but she’s dressed for it in her new down coat. Layers Layers on us all.Nikon joins us today with a little extra nudge from Captain. He darted back and forth between us three and Captain trying to decide should he stay or should he go. Finally out of sight as Captain drives off Nikon takes the lead and races up the trail, following the white blazes by the way. Rhodies and short tree growth protect us from the winds in the tree tops. A good couple of inches of snow covers the ground and remnants of the white stuff settle in the tree branches. A perfect day for a hike!Easy boy, easy. Nikon tears at my shoes and ankles as if to say come on let’s play or was it - come on let’s go. Hell I couldn’t understand Mad Dog I only know Lead Dog. Once we tangled I was trapped. I couldn’t walk or run from him. Harry takes off, come on Nikon come on. Yeah doggie go chase Harry. Bonnie doubles over with laughter. Finally off he goes happy once again and we are on our way.Meandering along we go with Stony creek road and then down to the creek passing over just a few ups to get our warmth up. Nice. Come on sunshine hit us but then it would fade to grey. It’s supposed to snow again this eve and I’m betting it will this close to WV and its mountain range. Always does. Say Lead Dog thought this hike was easy? Why am I sweating? Cause it’s sketti hike and you gotta work for it. Nikon seemed to enjoy himself. He celebrated by jumping in every creek crossing and taking a lay down Nikon style. Most of our crossings were uneventful UNTIL…..Hummm it’s pretty deep right there? What do you think of crossing this way Harry? Bonnies like, this doesn’t look good. Nikon crosses 3 times but none to our liking. Ok I think I see the plan….Step, rock, balance, re-evaluate, stttepppp, woops easy Martha, don’t fall in, one more stride and I’m on the bank. YES…utt oh, now what? This bank is slick as snot. I jab my sticks in for leverage to push myself up for a good foot hold. Got one in but then…..slip…I’m slipping…water below…hold on girl…tree tree where is a tree to grab? What seems like 30 minutes of fighting to stay up on this bank my co-hikers are cheering me on and making their on way to safety. Made it, I made it!!!! My hands are freezing from grabbing handfuls of snow and anything I could. Quickly I dig for my gloves and check to make sure all is well. Where a video when you need one? Harry says.Feeling the closeness of our next junction we look around and no Nikon. We call and call. Then a voice answers back. It’s Captain. He has driven back to pick us up. Ain’t he swee?. Nikon knew his way and ran to his master. We 3 head on up to check out the shelter for old time sake. Remembering our work hike here a few years ago it is always nice to see what changes might have occurred. Just a quarter mile and we are there. A big clear plastic tarp has been secured over the front of the three sided rock structure. With the fireplace inside this could be quite cozy. Hikers have been here or maybe hunters but it has been taken good care of. The tent signs we posted are still up too. Good deal.Here have some M&M’s Harry offers. Here have some more, fill up. Tricky that Harry is. He’s trying to get us full so we won’t want sketti sauce. Fat chance of that. Hurry Bonnie don’t let him by. Captain’s truck runs warm as we scamper back to the road. Can you smell the sauce? I can. Rich sweet sketti sauce, Captain’s finest. Like I said family, friends and fun. What more could you ask for after a little hike?","Stony Creek-Pine Swamp

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399671,"Who called this meeting? What fool said Hey let’s climb Sarver Holler? What the hell was I thinking planning a hike after a night out with friends? OOoohh this is gonna hurt!Dropping a car 9.5 miles down the way I’m already dreading that 2ish some miles of pure leg burning climb. It’s no joke on a good day. The kids are gearing up for it. Bonnie warns them to not try to keep up with me just take it slow and steady and she’ll see us at the shelter. Anna has a bit of a chest cold still and is dragging like me. See that ridge? That’s where we’ll be going.Jello legged about half way to the Sarver homestead I have to stop and get my wind. My head pounds with every heart beat. I need water. Thank goodness for a cold morning and the snow dusted under foot keeping temperatures down. I’m sweating. Come on Bonnie. I barely see her move below me on the trail. Anna and TJ are just behind me but slowing too. Hear that water? We aren’t far from the cabin. A few more hard pushes up the mountain and I see the creek and two remaining stone chimneys. Most of the old house and side buildings are completely fallen in now. Sad to see. We are in a good amount of snow now. Crusty and refrozen on top so when we step we don’t sink all the way to the ground. Let’s pass on checking out the cemetery today. I’m spent already and we still have to climb up to the AT yet and have a good 7.5 miles left for the day. Taking a rest at the Sarver Hollow Shelter I read some in the shelter log. Balls and Sunshine checked in here last May. That would be about right since we saw them on our Smokies hike in April. One last burn of the legs, a few switchbacks and blow down jumping and we make it to the crest of Sinking Creek mountain and the AT. A light goes off over TJ’s head. Say this is where we had lunch a few weeks ago. Yep that’s it, now let’s take you on some new ground. Anna’s eye glisten. We all have our second wind now and are glad to be done with the hardest part of the day. When’s lunch? 10:30am now. Well Anna are we running out of gas already? Nope just checking my schedule. This coming from a gal with no watch. Here have a jolly rancher. We’ll stop along the ridge some place so we can see out for lunch and hopefully out of the wind, which as picked up now. Say about 12 or 12:30 that will put us half way done.More snow and clouds. The sun just can’t stay out for good. When it warms the wind blows. I need my wool hat. TJ you need some gloves? Here take mine I have extra. Bonnie is the only one with boots on today. The kids have gone back to regular tennie shoes and I’m in my gortex trail runners. Some small drifts slow us down walking but really not too bad. I do almost lose a shoe a few times when my foot would crush thru the drifts and I try to keep stride. Ah the rock ledges. A good mile or more of this on Sinking Creek Mountain. They say feral goats have been seen up here. None sighted today just us billy goat gruffs. Side hill hiking can really wear the ankles and feet out. Bonnie’s boots are doing a number on her feet and I do believe Anna is ready for some dry shoes herself. Too windy to stop for lunch up here guys TJ confers, Let’s trek on but first we gotta get a photo with this wind twisted old pine. No way could it grow any taller than it is against the elements up here. Knarled and short we huddle in under its branches and say cheeze.Stopping for lunch in a gap with sun and wind protection we are starving. It’s about noon and we should be halfway about now. Gobbling down her granola, nuts and twigs Anna shares her lunch with TJ. She’s a vegetarian so getting enough protein is essential for strength. TJ is usually well feed but sometimes like now I do believe he’d like a bite of my sandwich. Say TJ you want the rest of my samich? It’s albacore, relish, onion, black pepper mayo on wheat. YUMMMM he scarfs it down. Fortified it’s time to get this train rollin again. Only a few more rocky spots and we are at The Continental Divide. A double blaze leads off still along the ridge line while the AT white blazes will take us 3 miles down to our car. One of these days I’m gonna see where this trail leads. Curiosity kills the Lead dog. Leaving the snow behind and wind we warm up quickly shedding hats and extra layers. This feels good, I feel good, we all feel good. Humming right along I start telling stories of previous hikes along this same section just last year. A work crew had been trimming bushes and undergrowth from the sides of the trail. Before I know it I’m tangled up and my stick gets caught up in something. My balance is heading all down hill and then I see a stawb from the fresh cut bushes. I’m gonna fall on that, I’m gonna fall on that, shit I did fall on that. Ahhh my leg my leg. Bonnie screams out Martha broke her leg oh know. Anna and TJ come to check on me while I get myself out of the shrubs. Holding my leg I don’t see any blood but boy is there a hen egg forming on my shin area and side of my calf. A perfect round circle the size of a quarter shows the impact on that damn stawb. I still don’t know how it didn’t cut my pants. Glad we only got mile and half to go guys. Medivac where are you?Aching with every step the numbness turns to pain. I just keep walking. I tell ya my percentages of falls this year has gone right thru the roof. Must be the booze or at least that’s what I’m blaming it on, can’t be my age. Soon I see the shelter, Niday. It has a nice new roof, privy and picnic table. We are only a ½ mile from car kiddos. We walk and we walk. Hummm it’s just around the last hill. We walk and we walk. Seems like an awful long mile there Martha, Bonnie snips. TJ says I’ve heard of these, there Martha Miles, yep I’ve heard of her. They all laugh out. Well it’s killin me just as bad as you, my legs ready to fall off. Look the road, I see my car.Hobbled I’m ready for a set down. The girls pull off their shoes as steam rolls off their feet. Ahh. Anyone for heading on up to Audie Murphy? I laugh. What a bunch of beat ups? We all have had enough for today. We’re full up on trail….at least for now anyways.","Sarver Holler

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400499,"Finally a nice sunny day for a hike. Temps are forecasted for the 50s with light winds. No snow left either. I’ve picked this little 9 ½ miler to stretch our legs once again and enjoy an easier section. Easy you say? Are you lying to us Lead Dog? How long is a mile? A Martha Mile?Woo John Woo Stop. He just past our parking spot not really knowing where to turn off. Bonnie and I are already here and try flagging him down. Thank goodness for cell phones. We’ll load up in my rig and drive down to Crandon and put on off a little side road 611 and hike back to the big suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. Say does anyone know if it is the longest on the trail? What about the Tye River bridge? Where’s Captain or maybe Jim to defer this question to?Thought we were going to Bland John asks. Well I was thinking of doing that 9 mile section which would cover to where we are starting today but decided on this one for a closer drive. My email said from Bland which would have been an 18 miler to Kimberling Creek. Don’t think so. But maybe another time. Man it’s nippy this morning. A slight wind makes this shady area quite cold. My fingers are numb. Bonnie can’t take it any more, get my gloves she says. John has forgotten his but manages just fine. He’s got 4 Gatorades though. Anyone up for a cold drink at lunch?He’s gone from carrying that extra sand to drinkable items now. Hey whatever works big boy. Briskly walking I know we’ll be at the Jenkins Shelter way before lunch time and plan to hike on across the next road up to a ridge to eat which should be about 5+ miles in. It’s 4.3 from where we started to this next road. A sign at the shelter says we have 1.2 miles left to get there. Bon Bon begins to calculate then John. Say is this gonna be one of those random mile days? Different numbers adding to different outcomes. Must be Martha Miles. No no I’m telling ya this part is 4.3 and then from the road to our cars is 5.2 miles. They don’t believe me. Sure Sure. So what time will we finish Bon asks? Oh about 1:30 I’d say. Well we know you can’t count but can you tell time?!! It’s like 10:45 and we’ve come to the road. Wow that was fast. It passed quickly while we talked about the CT trip, gear and hiking food. We have just the one hill to climb and I think we’ll crest so we can see out a little and enjoy our lunch. This was really the only climb of the day and graded nicely it was. I sure feel a sight better that last Sunday’s hike. Strong and rested. Maybe I should have picked a harder one? Seeing the double blazes up a head I know this is the spot. Thinking we’d be off the north side and in some sun I figure will be warmer. Well it was some warmer but a cutting wind kept blowing. Lunch was good and needed but time to roll it’s getting cold. I think I’ll leave my fleece on and gloves for a bit. John shoves his hands in his pockets and I check to make sure he has his sticks. They are tucked under his arms. Bonnie’s bundled too. Where did this wind come from? The ridge did provide us some nice views on either side to the valleys. A big farm and pond to our left and then a small community of Mechanicburg nestled around a church, fire house and convenience store down to our right. We seemed to walk above them most of this last 4 miles.Soon we reached the next double blaze to take us off the ridge and to warmer trail out of the wind. NICE. Wasn’t more than a few hundred yards before those top layers had to come off. So now how far Lead Dog? What’s the eta now? Oh about the same 1:30. The trail turns even more forgiving with a long grade down and along a fire road twisting around the mountain edges taking us closer and closer to Kimberling Creek. It always seems longer on a fire road walk I think. Too monotonous I guess. Look the field, remember that big tree Bonnie? It needs a swing I think. A long huge branch reaches out from it just above the trail, we walk under. This reminds me I gotta remember to take my rope and measure the Keffer Oak before we leave for CT. Then I’ll have a reference when we measure that Dover Oak. Down Down we go, thru the last orchard field and begin to hear the sounds of water, it’s the creek running strong after the hard rains and snow melt. Good to see. So what time is it guys? 1:45. Well now that’s pretty darn close to 1:30 don’t ya think? See ol Lead Dog can tell time and almost count. No Martha Miles today. On a side note the drive over takes us thru Amish Country, a little community of these folks settled along Walker Creek off Rt.42. I notice some buckets attached to trees along the way so I just had to stop to see what was in them. Well it looked like water. Each 5 gallon bucket had a lid and was secured to the tree above it’s roots about a couple feet. There was a tap screwed into the tree for the sap to drip. I’m guess the water was there to kept the sap from hardening or freezing, I just don’t know. There were 4 buckets to a tree and rows of them saddled for sap. Pretty cool.","Crandon Rt. 611

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/401085,"The skies were angry my friends. The winds howled with snow. The closer we drove into the belly of the Big Walker Tunnel the colder it grew. What have I gotten us into today? We’ll be Walkin’ in a Winter Wonder Bland.Snow covered the parking lot of the Dairy Queen just off the Bland exit, our gathering point. Sandman and the Kids are coming in separate cars so we each can travel our own direction when we get off the trail. They will follow me to our ending point where the trail connects with Rt. 52 just outside of Bland. We dropped their cars and loaded up with me to our starting point back at Rt. 611, Crandon. We all are looking forward to good little 9 mile hike and why not have it with a little snow. I had instructed everyone to dress in their warmest today. It’s always cold over here. I never imagined we’d have this white stuff to top it off. Glad the kids bought those new long johns yesterday on our shopping trip to Damascus. They both are testing them out. John bought a new pack which I’m sure he’ll bust out next hike when he has time to sort his things for packing. “So what’s the trail like today Lead Dog?” Easy? Well it will be easier than the last time you hiked up Sarver that’s for sure. Harder in the sense of distance though. With snow that shall increase the intensity too. Lots of PUDS to keep us warm I say. And thank goodness for them. I was warm in the first 15 minutes. Had to come out of my vest. Love these smartwool long johns too. It darn near has to be below 30 degrees before I will wear them and hike too. I shed my gloves to vent my heat. Gotta keep our wool hats on though too windy otherwise. Biting wind out of the north. Thank goodness it’s not driving winds either or it would be frosty. Rolling up and down the various terrain we can see out of either side of the ridge. Anna asks what the big view or destination is today? This section is truly a walk in the woods today folks, no real focal point. “What ain’t this good enough? TJ tells her. Get to walking he says. “You’re killin me Smalls”. And a new trail name is born. Tiny Pants and Smalls. A perfect little couple. Deeper the snow becomes to about 3 to 4 inches in places. Squalls come and go and then a large front begins to draw closer. A far wway ridge turns white and the heaviness of the clouds cover us. I feel we have come a good 4 miles and should be approaching some pine tree cover which could provide a place for lunch. I stop to check my map. Ok guys we can pull up here or push on to the shelter. It will be another hour or so before we get there. We had talked about having lunch at noon where ever we might be on the trail and it’s like 11:30 now. The agreement is to trek on and have a dry place to eat. Before we take off I notice John is struggling to get his Gatorade out his side pocket of his pack. Where’s your water spout? FROZE. I thought he had heard me say keep it in your coat. Just put the spout down in next to your chest and it will thaw from your body heat. He gets a big gulp Gatorade. “Anyone else up for one? I have 3” he says.I think we should make the shelter by 12:30 guys lets get crackin. The trail makes a few turns and tunnels through some very nice rhododendron sections. Green leaves provide a nice contrast with the snow to liven up what is a really grey day. Glad these rhodie sections aren’t heavy with snow on them or we’d be soaked. There’s the sign guys, the shelter sign for Helvey’s Mill. Wow that didn’t take long 12:10. Sign says a quarter mile, hum didn’t remember that but who cares. Not like we don’t have all day. Besides that will give us a cool 9.5 miles to say we will have hiked today. The blue blaze trail leads us down a bit and thru more rhodie tunnels and pines. A quite place to camp for sure. Harry, remember when we hiked here and met the boys scouts? Remember the journal about the little guy who blasted the privy so no one else could stand to go? Shortcut, remember this is the trail we met you and Jim on? Harry was with me. What great memories I have of this section. I share with my hikers today. Anna and TJ crawl back into the shelter for added warmth. John pulls out his lunch and low and behold I believe he has set a new trend. We’ve had colorful lunch bags before and bright after trail bags brought by some and now we have some trail glamour….A thermos so bright and quite pretty it might be fought over. Especially if what’s in it is nice and hot. He turns it up with a wink and giggle like a school kid with the best lunch at the table. Wanna trade? I pull out my bland ole thermos of soup too while Anna leaves a trail of crumbs for the shelter mice. Hey TJ better make sure she doesn’t eat like that in your tent or you will have crumbs in your bed. We don’t tarry long here as it didn’t take long before the chills set in. I noticed John’s outer jacket was soaked thru with sweat. His big down coat underneath was heated up I’m sure on that last climb here. He is first out and leads us back to the trail. 2.5 miles left guys. Snows a tad deeper here and the trail is turning off this ridge down down. Glad we didn’t have to come up this Anna says. Traction begins to get slippery and my sticks are locked in for balance. Easy don’t go over the edge I tell myself. Down down. We hear the interstate traffic echo between the valleys. Not far now. Look the road. Which way?Crossing a little stream and then up on the side road we have about a ½ mile or so of hard top road to walk. Is this the trail John asks? Yep see the white marks on the guard rail, the tree up ahead. We will be going right over I-77 in just a minute. Honk Honk. The kids have the truckers tooting at us. Hey no flashing now! The winds gusted so in this open cut I don’t think that would have been an option. I do hate road walking but it’s the trail and now you can say you hiked it. So there you have it….walkin in a winter wonder Bland. Bland, a place like none other. A place to which you never know who you might meet or what might meet you. Nothing bland about it.","Crandon Rt. 611

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/401908,"What a day of surprises. From this won’t fit in there to just how big is it? Say where are we going? Hope I have enough gas. From sunny and warm to what is this white stuff still doin here? Who are you and what have you done with the Captain?There were cars from everywhere this morning meeting at Level Green. Some on the side of the road and some at our regular designated area, Nascar style. Which way we going Lead Dog? Let’s split up to kill two birds with one stone. Captain you take John to drop a car over at John’s Creek and I’ll take the kids to measure the Keffer Oak. We’ll meet back here and start our hike.Sandman is caught off guard. His pack is in disarray and his tank is about out of gas(Unbeknownst to the rest of us) New pack verses big ass bag. Uhhh that sleepin bag ain’t gonna fit in here John. Well it will but nothing else is gonna. Supplies are every where. Cramming his tent in for some practice weight along with his Gatorades he’s ready at least for today. Come on kiddos lets see what that tree has to hold for us. We drive over the hill and park closer so we only have ½ mile to walk to the Keffer Oak. I have my bear rope and duct tape on my sticks to mark our record tree. It’s just gotta be bigger than the northern Dover Oak. I hold my spot will TJ goes as far around her as he can. Anna makes sure we are even in height with no slack. One rope length and a quarter he says. Anna tears off some duct tape and places our mark on the rope. I’ll put a tape measure to it when I get home. (To tell you now, the length was 20 feet 2 inches) This was measured at about my eye level. So we’ll do the same when we see the Yankee tree. Gathering back at our starting point it has already warmed up to were I foresee me in some short britches today. No gloves needed. Down thru the donkey pasture we go headed for Kellys Knob. There’s all kinds of new gear headed up the trail. The kids and Captain all have new trail runners and Anna has new pants and a top. John of course has that new pack too. Man I gotta go shopping or I’ll be left out. Gear talk continues as we head over the hill into the woods. Captain is felling froggy and takes off after we stop to shed some layers. He knows what’s up ahead and wants to give it all now while the trail is forgiving. Look at him go, fleet of foot and light on his feet having lost 30 some pounds since last year some time. He’s having to pull his pants up and synch his hip belt. We’ve missed him on the trail. He says he is in training mode now and ready to hike those miles in Connecticut. Passing the now fallen in Blair Witch house we begin our creek descent and crossing before meeting up again at Laurel Creek Shelter. The kids are glad we came back since they really didn’t get to fully enjoy the trail on their first visit here. They ran in to catch up with us after getting lost on the drive over that day. Snow remains under the cover of the laurel bushes. Quite cool too. The water rushes as we rock hop over the first crossing. Easy does it on this next one. I remember I walked up this big slanted rock last visit. I think I’ll go this way again. Woop Woop, I’m slipping. Dropping to my knees I claw in. Anna is behind me squatted down like a catcher waiting on that big pitch. I got you Martha, I got you. I’m digging for traction and make it over the ledge. Wew that was close. DON’T COME THAT WAY! We all laugh.Waiting at the shelter we have a little snack and see where someone has camped and tried building a fire with laurel limbs. They don’t burn baby. And don’t leave your trash in the pit either. Rookies. Ya’ll catch your wind here now cause you’ll be out of it by the time we get to the top. Our climb is about 700 feet in less than a mile. It will feel like all day if you’ve never hiked it before. Soon I hear the cries out of are we close yet? Where’s the top? Ok Martha we’ve had enough, tell the truth when are we gonna stop? Captain has already dropped out of sight moving at his own pace. The others are at the mercy of Miss Lead Dog. Push it baby push it. Feel the burn. See those green bushes ahead? That’s the top. Conversation goes easy now as we move along the ridge. Still some snow here too. Captain has already asked if I brought my yak traks. Nahh it won’t be that bad. But I begin to wonder knowing all the down yet in store later. At least the wind isn’t howling. But it defiantly isn’t 60 degrees. A grey day now with clouds thickening. There’s the sign, time to turn off and see the rocks of Kelly’s Knob. It’s Sandman’s first visit here and he follows TJ’s lead across the rocks. Step and jump and easy don’t look down. The crevasse are just wide enough you can’t really just step across them and deep enough to well, die if you fall, or get hurt pretty bad. I’ve been across a few times but it ain’t my cup of tea. I’ll wait over here for the Captain. He can tell you the logistics of our location and mountains surrounding us. I’m pretty sure of them all but rather defer to our ole sage. After the geography lesson and some scolding from the Lead Dog trying to keep my kids safe from harms way its picture time. Anna says it sure was good to have lunch without wearing gloves. She’s wished for snow hiking and really got her fill these last few months. Bring on Spring!!!Some blue sky pops out just as we start to meet some more hiking coming our way. They have parked at Rocky Gap and taken the shortest route in but still have to climb a good mile or more. Some look happy and some not so much as we pass them. The snow deepens but not bad. Just more that I expected to still see. Gonna be slick on the rocks just past the road I think. Captain you wanna sell them yak traks? He has walked farther without them than I thought he would and finally gives in and is ready to strap on. “Enough of his walking with my ass pinched tight afraid of falling” he says. A big tub sets beside the trail. Trail Magic guys lets take a look. Nada, a couple empty beer cans and food wrappers. Guess business has been sparse this time of year. Us trak-less hikers proceed on, asses pinched tight, and knuckles white holding on to our sticks. It is tricky. Say how long do we have this to contend with John asks. Oh it’s 2 miles to the finish and I guess we’ll be in this lovely state for a mile. So just hang on and enjoy the ride. Anna wishes she had the sled just before busting her behind on a slick rock. Did I tear my pants? TJ gives a good inspection and a pat, no. Finally out of the snow and in the leaves the temps are warming nicely. Wow what a change like 10 degrees. I’m ready to get back into my shorts. I had zipped off the legs on the way up but had to put back on at the knob. Look blue skies. I hear a plane too. Harry, oh Harry it that you? Johns Creek runs clear and cool. Bet that would feel nice on a hot day Anna says. A native trout’s happy home. Just keep walking and you’ll come to War Spur shelter, then Wind Rock and Mountain Lake. We’ll do that soon. Really want to be sure it’s warm up there. Like the Captain said it’s the highest peak in Giles County. Coming out of the woods into the warmth of the sun sure felt good. Feels like spring. What a great ending to the day. Now lets just hope we got enough gas to get home John adds. Puzzled looks come on everyone’s face. Yep I only had quarter of a tank coming out this morning. I didn’t know we’d be driving all the way to West Virginia by gosh. Surprise Surprise you just never know what Lead Dog will pull. You better have the tank full and pack 2 extra sandwiches cause the weathers changing and I’ll get my Martha Miles in one way or another.","Sinking Creek

Not a chance today. We are socked in, surrounded and rain is all about. We met at the park-n-ride loading up in 2 cars, Sandman and me followed by Smalls and Tiny Pants. John’s in his usual pre-hike mode; scattered. Humm could be a new trail name. I’ll have to think on this. “I gotta get to a McDonald’s he says” Sure ok. “Ahh I had my rain jacket out but left it. But I do have that tarp/poncho.” Well at least you have that, will be a good day to test it and see if you like it. John orders two ham biscuits and a coffee and we’re ready to roll. The skies are heavy with clouds and rain is a really comin down while we drive down the interstate. John’s car is left at Daleville where we’ll finish. We load up in TJ’s rig and head back to Andy Lane Trail, our 3.1 mile connection to the AT. Everyone keeps peering out the windows for a better looking forecast but none to be found. RAIN it is.Out of the car and into our packs we go. The kids have done as instructed and put in extra trash bags for pack covers. They don’t have their store bought ones just yet so this will have to do. I put on my rain gear pants included. It’s gonna be muddy so I’ll protect my pant legs from getting soaked.

We ain’t been 1 mile and the mud is creeping up over the shoe soles and splattering the pant legs. So much for new shoes, right guys..Yuk! Those damn hills are gonna be a bitch I think. I chose this direction to get the hardest up out of the way early and besides coming down them at the end of a long day would be slippery hard. We are already sweating under our gear and needed to dress down and do. Temps are fair now about mid 40s but could change with a gust of wind and get down right damp cold quick. Ya’ll keep dry if you can but don’t sweat. My glasses steam up, I can’t see the trail. I gotta shed again. Rain suppresses once we hit the big ass hills. Grab your granny low gear. We dig in. Step Slide, Step, Step, Slide. Gosh this is hard. Not a sound is heard. Just my heart beating and me breathing. Sticks pack up with mud driving into the earth. One hill down one more to go. “Where’s the top?” Just keep digging.We are relieved to reach the switchbacks and the gap at scorched earth. Have I been here before John asks. Yep we hiked it in a loop over Tinker Creek last year. The Kids start to recall coming here too. Let’s snack here at the gap rock and get a photo before heading off to Daleville. We go 10 more miles to go so we don’t want to tarry too long. Heading off to hike new trail everyone is excited about it. Chipper that the rain has really held off too. “Say since we already hiked all the UP today we got all down hill left right? Sandman inquires. Yes well actually it is a mostly down grade since the trail was moved from a couple of truly hard climbs. Too bad we can’t see out is the consensus. I feel closed in TJ describes. Could you stand it for say a week? Anna begins wishing that isn’t the case come CT trip.Clipping along the miles are hard to determine due to no land marks to see and mark off. Once past the only shelter of the day it’s just a walk in the woods, a stroll in the forest. The only thing left to do is get well trail educated. When did the trail start? By who? Who hiked it first? What kind of tree is that again? Do you wear gators when it rains or shines? What’s the elevation here? What’s our highest elevation in CT? Some we answered with confidence and some half guesses but we did get our education. Anna was a tad off her beat today. A little extra green potion from the leprecon last night has left her feeling not so good. So when she announced she was hungry I figured now is as good a time as any. We’ve just crested what is usually a nice overlook over Botetourt and its noon. No wind and no rain and NO VIEW. I begin asking what each has for lunch and discover John has left his second ham biscuit in the car. Oh I have a pop tart I found in here. Ok Johnny Boy am I gonna have to check your school bag for your homework before the bus comes each trip? He gives a sheepish grin. Hiker share goes into motion and we all offer anything we have in our goody bags to fortify our friend. It isn’t long before the chills set in and we gotta get. TJ barely has his lunch down, hands turning red from cold. Wait Wait I’m not finished. This train’s a travelin…..Gusts of wet fog roll over us. Damp. Walking quickly I’m guessing we’ve covered about halfway. Still no steady rain to impede our progress over the scattered rocks so that is good. Here’s where the trail used to come in and cross here. We go all around the hard stuff. Yes. Before long we’ve reached Angels Gap. Let me check my map and see what exactly we have left. Where’s John? I had been with head down and chatting along with the kids I didn’t even notice he had dropped out of sight. We have 5 miles left guys. It’s 1:38. We should be done about 3:30/4. John comes in view and is quite. Care for a jolly rancher? I need to stretch my legs Lead Dog, I’m gonna head on. Ok man do it to it. And he disappears in the fog, his yellow pack cover the last thing to fade in the mist. Hayrock is a mile ahead kids. You’ll love it. What’s this here ahead, a side path? Humm hope John didn’t take that. He’ll end up in Botetourt some place. Here’s another path on our right. That could lead to Carvin’s Cove. Can’t see it out there due to this fog but trust me it IS there. Anna stays concerned hoping our buddy is on the white blazed path. Sure he did, the marks are readily seen at each junction sooo of course he saw them. I hope??Check out these rocks! Scampering around and up and down they go. Wow they are something. The trail crews have covered over the graffiti with paint the blends into the rocks. Looks so much better. Hay! Let’s Rock…and see if we can’t catch John. Can we walk the last few miles and be done by 3:30, Anna asks. It’s gonna be tough. We have a little more ridge and then come to a powerline. Then down down. Feet are gonna be tired. Hummm Hummm, What’s that? With the fog ungulfing everything you couldn’t see it ahead. It’s the power line. It sizzles. Oh it does that on a clear day but seems louder since you can’t see it. Bet if we stayed up here for a few days we’d come off with super powers, TJ jokes. Let’s not hang around to find out. Deep down I know we can’t make the car by 3:30 but am walking about as fast as I can without jogging. TJ’s knee is beginning to ache and Anna says her feet are too. I know mine are. Fast walking on tired legs will do it. Look a foot print. Looks like John’s track. How far? How far? We cross the railroad tracks, 10 minutes. Let’s run? No way. Hope he’s at the car. Well here’s the junction we take to cut off the trail. See the blazes go off to the left? The trail will wind around the hotel and come out just on the upper side of the Exxon and run into 220. So he can’t get too far lost. Tell ya what if he crosses 220 and passes the Pizza Hut he’s getting a new trail name. Coming out of the woods and seeing John’s car, we see no movement. No John. Well let’s go up the hill and check on Magellan. Rounding the bend of the Exxon parking lot here he comes. Hey guys I followed those blazes just like I’m supposed to, took the scenic route and grabbed a candy bar. Haha just making sure you weren’t on your way to Maine. Well we never found that little leprecon nor that rainbow but we did find a little pot of gold at the end of the trail…it’s called the Exxon.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/404327,"Come on Captain let’s do some adventure hiking. I’ve been wanting to see where the blue blazes lead from the ridge of Sinking Creek mountain at the Continental Divide. There’s a sign pointing the way to the Gulf of Mexico and the other way to the Atlantic Ocean. Double blue blazes calling me to see where they might lead off into the woods….Starting from Craig’s Creek road we have quite the climb for the first 4 miles. Yeah baby, let’s get our hike on Captain. With just us 2, “Captain why don’t you lead the way so I can watch your ass for a change?” Haha He had considered bringing the dogs but thought better of it. Nikon has been fully healed from his knee surgery for a while now so why take the chance. Besides we already got one lame dog out here don’t need another. Just kidding ole man.It sure was good to walk with my old partner once again. With my new couple of hikers along this season I’ve been keeping the wheels running a little quick. Captain’s been on his own training regimen readying himself for the trail. First was to lose weight. He’s down 31 pounds since Dec 2011. WOW. Now to get the balance and strength back. He’s working on that with his trainers at the gym. Then he's been hitting the treadmill and climbing those imaginary mountains. Say is this mountain imaginary today? NO WAY.Coming up on Niday Shelter we know the next few miles will be a climb and will warm us up. It was down right chilly starting out, gloves on and jackets. We decide to shed those while getting a drink of water. We noticed where the old trail used to run and see where the trail crews are running yet another route to avoid the erosion on the current path. Pink ribbons are tied to the trees marking its way. Branches are lain criss cross on the ground to deter folks from taking the oldest path. Humm we might take a look at that when we come back Captain says. I'm game.Each time I think we are just about to summit the ridge another ridge forms behind it. White blazes showing many more feet to climb. We do pass the time by talking of preparation for the CT trip. Things we have learned from past hikes, like frogg toggs and dry ducks suck in the rain, that boots are no more the trail footwear of choice, don't leave home without extra socks and always leave a good note of where you are if others are behind you. Plans are made for each day of this upcoming trip to have several check points for fast hikers to stop and wait on slower hikers to catch back up so we don't get too strung out. With that I give the Captain a nudge to pick up the pace and get to the top of this ridge. Don't you push me Lead Dog, I plan to get there without stopping today he says with a wink.Steady we go making progress. West winds greet us at each false summit. Damn where's the top? Heck I just hiked this a few weeks ago. Coming the other direction I do remember saying man this is alot of down. Don't get me wrong it ain't steep steep just pesky never ending up. We plan to have our first lunch at the sign which we feel isn't that much farther. When the trees start getting shorter and the light of the sky can be seen threw them you sorta know the top is close.There! I see the sign, let’s eat.Hats and jackets go back on. Temp says 48 but feels like 38. Clouds roll apart and provide some sunshine to glisten down on us while we set on the rocks for a bite. Ahhh this is nice. Hope the blue skies stay like this Captain. Me too. Trail mix and honey buns yumm yumm. Wonder how far this side trail is? The hunters say they haven't noticed blazes from the road we think it will come out on. Captain's worker friends asked him to report back on animal activity. Where's the turkeys? the deer? Hike the damn trail and you'll find out he says. We speculate this adventure trail should be 2 to 4 miles on out the ridge but little do we know....One blue blaze, two blue blaze, we look we walk. I look over my shoulder to see if there is a blaze on a tree behind me to keep my direction. Captain does the same. NO MORE BLUE BLAZES.... What the heck? We branch off in different directions following gaps in the trees which could be a path but nada. No trail. No more marks to follow. Knowing if we continue and have to bush whack this could be quite hard we toss in the towel and abort. Shucks I feel I've been cheated out of my miles. Looks like we'll just have to retrace out steps and head back on that same ol AT. That ain't so bad, it's all down hill and we can check out the original AT path. Humm now where should we stop for lunch? Will the shelter be too far? It's a bit cold to just stop here on this slope so we press on. Thinking we will not meet a sole voices are heard just ahead. A group of 6 men approach. The lead hiker looks experienced as if in training and the others grow less hiker looking as they descend back. Hey where ya headed for the night? Next to the last guys says La Quita. I didn't get it at first but then we all laughed. Yep he's ready for town and just on a day trip they say. They are hiking from Craig’s Creek to 603. That's the road the kids and I walked in from to get the Keffer Oak measurements. When we tell them the Continental Divide sign is just behind us they are elated.Down Down we go and begin warming too. Sure hope the weather holds for our planned overnight this coming weekend. Coming back to the burned section of the trail where looks like a storm hit we know the shelter isn't far so we'll take our late lunch there. Workers have built a new privy and picnic table. Steps look fairly new too. Then we notice a party has been had. Empty beer cans and food cans piled up under the corner of the shelter. If you carry it in full why can't you carry it out empty? I begin to stomp cans for packing out while Captain does his housekeeping duty by sweeping out the shelter. There we go all tidy, now we can move on.With an empty case of beer on my back and a kick in my step I tell Captain to lead the way out. Let's get our adventure hiking fix. Turning off away from the white blazes we both estimate which way the old path will go and where we will come out. We pretty much hit it the nail on the head. And what's an adventure hike without some quizzing on tree knowledge. Ok Martha, what type tree is this? Oak, no that's maple. What kind of bark is that? Oak, no hickory. Damn, O-fer. Buck pine, white pine, ground cedar. Now I'm back in the game. Shag bark hickory, Yes I got it!!! Stretch it out ol man this trail is a walk in the park. Show me what ya got while I breeze thru your next questions. That slight feeling of getting a little cheated today was all erased. By the time we reached our end I had been refreshed in the Captain's Crash Course of trail knowledge and he had conquered his miles to the Divide.","Craig's Creek Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/405291,"Well here we are out for our first and only shakedown hike before the big trip. Osprey packs are everywhere just pick a color and your size. Some are old and some new, some things borrowed and some things blue. Stewart from Outdoor Trails dropped us off at Bearwallow Gap nice and early so he could return to open up shop. Of course you know me I like early. This will give us plenty of time to set up camp, gather water and fire wood and relax before night fall.Slim Jim had the longest commute coming from Raleigh yesterday and then driving in from Hillsville this morning. The park-n-ride has become a regular meeting place for us now with the kids in Blacksburg, John too and me coming over from Pulaski. Ok did you already run thru your head a thousand times what did I forget? Did I put that in? Smalls quickly announces they have a problem…No sticks but we got our hot oatmeal breakfast for the ride down. Young and energetic I know they will be fine. Alright Johnny boy, no sand in there today, right? His pack looking a little over stuffed. Look a new mat. New shirt too. Jim’s got his homemade pack and some new duds too. Buddy has a new lead line and new trail manners. Me, I got all my old stand-bys and even having to carry a tent today. That’s ok good practice for me too. 27 pounds let’s go. As we approach the trailhead snow blankets the mountain sides. I figured we’d be in it but how much? And for how long?Tiny Pants takes the lead. Smalls follows. Where is the trail? Blazes? Road crossing are always a little harder to follow and this will give them an idea of what to look. Blazes can be on guard rails, on the road or even the back of a road sign so don’t always look for them on the trees. Out at a quick pace I let them go. No telling how fast they’d be with sticks. Sharing the load really helps them stay light. Packs couldn’t be more than 20 pounds a piece. However I know too fast a pace will tire you out quick so I’ll see how this shakes out. The snow has melted on the path but lingers all around. Sunny and mild with a touch of coolest causing us to keep our gloves handy. We’ll be walking just along the parkway most of the day. Slight elevation changes to keep us honest you might say. Yo Lead Dog, Jim hollers out, what’s that magic watch say? When is it gonna rain? Is it sunny? Ok Smart ass don’t be jealous just because your wrist doesn’t tell you the weather. Buddy can’t you keep your master quite?Before we know it we’re at Bobblet’s Gap our first scheduled break. I didn’t remember it begin .2 miles off the trail so we opt to keep trucking for a better place to set and enjoy the view. Peaks of Otter stands off in the distance. A fine place for a group photo and a little break. With the trail crossing the parkway at various overlooks we have many options for resting points. Let’s shoot for Harveys Knob the halfway point for lunch. Heck as I speak we are walking past it. We’re cookin folks. Told ya today’s miles will be no comparison to tomorrows. Easy verses strenuous for sure.Rolling along with the parkway with ups and down just enough to keep us warmed up, snow still under our feet and hunger in our bellies. Then just ahead we spot a picnic table-Lunch!   Montvale and the wide open valley. Say who’s bag is who’s? Everyone of us have an orange food bag. Sandman pulls out his super sized blue food bag. Do you think mine will be mixed up he says? This thing could have held 10 days of food. What else you got in there Sandman? 2 of everything. 2 tents, 2 sleeping bags, I packed everything Martha told me and then extra he says with a Cheshire cat smile. In the mean time Jim is digging in the parkway trash cans for a water bowl for buddy. He has left it in Stewart’s car on the ride over. No fear we’ll turn this lunchable bowl into one. Show and tell time began next. So what’s for lunch? What did you bring for supper? Jim shows off his shrimp and fresh veggies he plans to fix later opting for snackie lunch of goldfish and chocolates. Hey I got 1 of 49 flavors of cliff bars to barter John says? I got chili bean soup, I got pasta parmesan. Here how about a cliff bar? Pizza Hut tomorrow guys. There’s no stopping us. How far are we from camp Lead Dog? About 4 miles guys. Some more parkway walking and then we’ll turn off to the northside of the mountain and head for Wilson Creek. Sure hope this snow is gone by then. Will be a cold night otherwise. And soon the trail did turn off but right in to deeper snow. About 4 inches or more worth for the next 2 miles down. Slippin and sliding we make it in and out of it with breaks of sunshine cleared trail.Coming close to a water source I decide it will be a good place for a break and water reload. Practice for attaining water from trickle and not a stream. TJ pulls out a cliff bar wrapper and we secure it with a rock to widen the water flow and begin filling our nalgene bottles. Nothing like fresh mountain water. Man that’s good and cold. This will tide us over till we can gather more at camp. The snow has disappeared under foot. Look ahead Anna that looks like a nice place for a shelter. Woods, sunny and dry. Peering thru the tall trees I stare hard as if I could make a shelter appear just thinking of it. Pop it does. Wilson Creek Shelter.We looked like kids getting off the school bus running to drop our book bags and heading for a couch. We scattered the place and laid back to enjoy the sweet sunshine. Buddy was fasten to his tree lapping up some water while Jim and I gave out instructions of what we should do next. Have a snack, get water and then we’ll set up tents. When can we build a fire? Smalls is all about the fire business. If we build it at 2:30 we’ll be gathering wood again for 7:30 when it gets dark. Hang in there girl.Jim and I get water from the creek over the hill. Not a long way but just long enough that one trip was all I wanted to make. We took a hiking pole to hang our water bag over so we could share the load on the way back. Tents went up and firewood was gathered. Speaking of tents, what’s that motel going up on the knoll? The Sandman has his NorthFace “Sweet” Frog up. It has a vestibule big enough to drive up and drop your luggage off like the Marriott. Jim’s got his and buddy’s home complete with a lead line for running. No bells a whistle for them two. Rain fly and ground cloth only. I pick a spot out of ear shot of the kiddos. Didn’t want to cramp any bodies style our here in the wilderness. Me and little Hubba will tuck here in the leaves for warmth. I do like my little tent. She started with me in Georgia and has been on many little section hikes. Comfy.Soups on!! Stoves and pots galore. Pastas and steam, flavors and smoke. We should be attracting guests by now. Wonder if we’ll have a thru hiker or so tonight? Jim’s shrimp begins to boil while John’s trying to get 8 cups of dry goods to fit with water in an 8 cup pot. Ain’t gonna work John. Oh and I have some chicken to fit in there too!!! We need a mess hall pot for all that. Laughing we get him measured down so he can cook ¼ now and fix more later if he likes. Nicely he shares some chicken with me and the kids. It worked well with my black bean chili and tortilla soup. The new stove of TJs pleased them and they gobbled down 2 loads for Lipton sides. We all stood back letting our chef Slim Jim work his chopped madness into mouth watering wonder. Shrimp and veggies lo mein. Look who’s coming here, a hiker, we did attract one. Bub from Bluefield rolled into camp just as we were finishing our meals. He started Feb 20th, skipped some up into Damascus and came home for a week and has just come up from Daleville. A strong fellow in his 40s with a Osprey Pack big enough to hold a small child. Said he started with about 20 some pounds but guessing he froze and is now carrying a good 50+. Funny though he only put on a long sleeve shirt after cooling off. Still in shorts and tucked into his sleeping back in bare feet. Tough mountain boy. It’s fire time, light it up Anna. Jim’s little wax ball and my fire sticks got a nice flame going to lay a good start to a hot bed of coals. We burned all but 3 sticks as night fell and the stars began to light the sky. Too cold to just hang out and some tired we all retreat to our tents. 9:04PM The Norfolk Southern train whistle blows and the lights go out.","Bearwallow Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/405477,"Wow the temps got a little chilly last night. While writing before bed I had to cut it short cause my hands and arms we getting quite cold being out from under the covers. It was an uneventful night with hardly a sound. Even Buddy Coonhound was silent.So guys how did everyone sleep? Chilled and uncomfortable was the census but made it ok. Sandman is trying out a sleeping bag from Captain and it was tooo short. He was very cold and had a hard time keeping his heat in. Say is that new mat insulated? Oh and just thought if you didn’t close your vestibule that could cause a big draft too. We say good bye to our shelter friend and wish him well on his journey north. Time to head for town and that pizza hut. 8:09am we pull out. A cool morning but very calm and quite nice. Sun tries to come over the ridge to warm the holler we are in. Winding down deeper we reach the creek. Man its chilly here glad we had camp where we did. Following the creek we’ll come to Curry Creek and its side trail. Might be a good place for everyone to catch back up. I noticed John had dropped out of the mix. Our sweeper Slim Jim says he stopped for a bathroom break. It’s a bit too cold to stop long here so let’s push on up this next climb and rest on its summit I say. This is our hardest up of the day and looks like it will be in full sun. I’m ready to sweat!The long switchbacks begin. I gotta get out of this extra shirt. I dig my sticks in and grab granny low. The kids are just behind me but falling back just a tad. No sticks on a climb can put a lot of extra pushing power on the legs, they are tiring. Buddy is an asset on the ups, mush mush Jim calls out to him. Still no John in sight. Sweat pops out on my nose and my face starts heating up. Each switchback turns steeper as we approach to crest. I target a big oak with a blaze on it as my stopping point. The forest road should just be up ahead. The packs come off and we crash all about. Water water! Anna’s too heated up to eat her snack. TJ says his foot is getting a hot spot. Ahh the troubles of day 2 on a hike. Day 2 is always the hardest day. Legs are tired and you normally have a restless nights sleep because you aren’t tired enough to sleep dead. Trust me tonight you will.Kicked back in the sun I see the top of Sandman’s hat popping up and down as we comes in closer to sight. Hey Johnny Boy you made it! Yep I’m here. That was some haul. Speaking of haul aren’t you missin some of your load? Say What? Yeah your tent sack looks half empty. This morning he had decided to rearrange the location of this mat and tent. Switching them to opposite places in the pack and the tent was now strapped to the bottom on the outside. Oh man, looks like part of it has fallen out. Guess it did when I stopped way back or maybe it just fell out recently? Who knows? He hurriedly rushes back off to look for it. Leaving everything else here. Do you have water? And off he goes out of sight saying he’ll see us at the shelter (our lunch stop Fulhardt Knob). In a fleeting moment the rest of us begin to second guess this decision. We had met 2 trail maintainers some miles back and maybe they’ll pick it up? What if it really was back where he stepped off the trail? That could be 3 miles back. He’d have to rewalk 6 miles that would be a 16.6 mile day. Plus this hill he just climbed would have to be reclimbed again. Oh Man! He didn’t take his phone or water. Not good. Walking on slowly I say a little prayer that the missing sweet frog is just a bit down the trail and he has already found it and on his way back to us. Bring Sandman back safe. We’ll save you a piece of pizza Jim jokes. Anna is now hungry since she skipped her snack. Let’s go ahead and stop and that will give John more time to reach us. We hadn’t hardly finished discussing the next times and taking 5 minutes to form a plan if this were to happen again when the Sandman pops up behind us. Only walking 200 yards back he began to run the scenarios around in his mind too and decided to let fate take it. If it turns up fine if not I’ll just order another. So here we are all back in our peloton ready to make the climb to Fulhardt knob. The fire road turns out to be one long pull. Wide and graded but long. Snow turns back up too making things cool down once again. Feels good we’re sweating. TJ’s foot is hurting more now too. Hang in there bud. How much farther Anna asks? Half a mile.I see the junction sign, YES almost there now. 0.1 to the shelter. Jim asks if the cistern is still there. Yep sure is. This is the only shelter on the trail with a water source supplied by rain fall. It gathers from the guttering system and is housed in a cement holding area behind the shelter. Then it flows out to a spicket. Buddy is glad, he laps up his water. What a nice area. I haven’t been in here in some years. 5 miles to go guys. Can you taste the pizza? We all are eating the last of goodies in our food sacks. Some skimped on lunch and will be good and hungry come town time. It’s warmer now and we’ll burn even more calories. The kids ponder cooking something but opt to save what water they have for hiking. Let’s get a fun shot here on the picnic table before we leave. Can we do YMCA?Of course we can. All we needed was some music to wrap it all up. Say John what’s that laying on the ground by your pack? It is part of his zip off pants. He just about walked off and left it. Ok Johnny Boy are we gonna have to start pinning things to you? Back to the north side of the mountain we’re back in the snow briefly before coming out to warm sun and more hikers. Down Down these 2 miles making good time but hurting our feet and knees. We’re almost at the bottom and a road crossing guys. Maybe there will be some trail magic Jim hollers out. And magic there was…Look it’s John’s tent!!!. Thank you Mr. Gary Bible and other trail maintainer for the delivery. They have picked up the sweet frog and left it in a bag on a post with a note. You have made our day. Now let’s get these last 3 miles knocked out.The railroad tracks are just ahead and then the Troutville Road. You’ll be crossing under the interstate shortly too. Where is Daleville? I can see it on the kids faces. Are we there yet?When I walked this the first time I said I’d never walk it again. I hated walking this close to town and all the sounds of the roads. Today I can’t wait to pass thru it all again. Where’s that pizza hut. At least I have the remembrance of how far we might be. The others are running out of steam. I gotta get them up over this last wide open field. Posts blazed our way up this stubborn damn hill. The ridge ending in the clouds of the sky. It looked like we’d walk right into heaven. I throw my arms up with triumphant joy when I reached the top. Meandering closer and closer to town I ask the TJ if having the option to cutting it short would he do it. NOPE I’ve come this far let’s finish it. Anna seconds the notion. He is limping a little now and his blister has no popped. Jim and John are our back a ways. My guess is they’ll cut off at the Exxon. Come on pines spit us out at that pizza hut. I can see the blazes cutting out of the woods to the road. We are here. We dodge cars crossing 220. Daleville has been found but we still have few more blazes to see before we can say this section is complete. Come on Tiny Pants show us the way. Smalls pulls ahead they want this over man and like fast. I’m racing behind legs ready for a rest myself. Don’t miss the turn off or you’ll end up at Tinker Creek I chuckle. Emerging from the side trail and out in the park-n-ride we started from yesterday Slim Jim and Sandman cheer us on. They did cut off having already walked it before. John lies out in the back of his hatch with the Cheshire smile on again. We made it we made it Anna shouts. That was a good hike. So could you do it again tomorrow? Are you ready to make a 14 mile day in Connecticut? A hush comes over, ahhh well, sure, gonna have to. Let’s go eat Pizza!!!","Wilson Creek Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/407900,"A good hiking friend told me these very words:“Words are interesting---take the word “rock”---I’ve listened to it all my life, even climb a few. A Good word.Now take “castle”---another nice word, regal sounding, lovely visions.Finally the word “gorge”---a fun word, has an air of adventure to it, promise of breath taking beauty.Now if we you take these 3 fine upstanding and respectable words and put them all together…well for some reason you get bumpkis out of them, the sum is less than the parts here. My advice is to avoid combining those 3 words as nothing good can come from it”Author Harry ‘The Straggler” MooreWell I never!! How could such be summed from a wondrous 10.9 mile loop hike? A hike which gives the feeling of accomplishment for your efforts after climbing from a gorge… emerging to open fields with vast views, the sights of majestic rock structures, and the babbling of a mountain creek. Don’t you dare listen to that wordster. You come for yourself.And come they did. I had a good crowd today. Some that had hiked this loop before, some many times, and some newcomers. Our last prep hike before leaving for Connecticut this coming Saturday. I can’t believe it is here.Ol Lead dog did her trick. I decided we’d tackle the hardest part first, the 4 mile climb from the Gorge up to Rocky Knob and see the shelter. A shelter once used by the AT when the trail used to pass thru here. I know I know if it ain’t the AT why hike it? Well because it used to be and for some that might be an interesting fact. A warm morning already awaits us. Even down in the gorge with some shade things began to heat up. I’m not sure if it was all sunshine or Bonnie blasting me for driving all the way down here so we’d have to hike back up. Either way I was feeling the heat. John has brought his buddy Herb along for the ride and is looking forward to seeing the trail from a different perspective. John’s hiked this loop but from the campground start. Herb is new to it and so are the kids. Sign reads 3.0 to Rocky Knob campground. 4.0 to Rocky Knob. So let’s get’er done!We are all sooo happy to have a sunny day. No snow, no rain. A great day for a hike. The trail is lined with spring color. Flowers are starting to pop, trees are budding and animals are about. Deer, birds, and chipmunks. Look Dutchman britches. Trillium. Trout lilies. Blood Root. Note these were all very easy to find as our noses where to the trail as our legs began the pumping to climb this gorge. Sure glad we decided to climb this now while it’s not so hot I say trying to get a positive response from my fold. Nothing. Just hard breathing and a few grunts. The kids and I pull away from the pack. John, Herb and Bonnie are taking a slower more reserved pace. Come on kids let’s burn up these rock steps and soon we’ll be to a little water crossing and we can cool our faces. My butt’s a burning Anna says. Yep we’ll have buns of steel girl. Not sure if TJ is all about that for himself. Anna is light today, no pack. TJ is carrying it all since they have prepacked for our big trip. As he said she’s just out for a walk, that ain’t hiking. Wetting my face down the back group comes in. Bonnie has lost her hat. Fell off when she stopped to take off her pack for something. She tried to go back to find but to much down to retrace back up. Best left lost. Not good for a sweeper…John says they left me behind for the sweeper position and I lost my tent. So they wouldn’t let me retake that job. So just how much more of this climbing is there today? Oh just this morning, once we reach the shelter it’s ALL DOWN HILL FROM THERE. How many times do have to hear that? Sandman wants to rename me to Martha ‘bullshit’ Thomas. Easy now…Reaching the campground area we soak up the rays in the wide open field and have a snack while waiting on the others. Herb hasn’t hiked lately and Bonnie’s been vacationing so this will be a hard trip for them today. TJ and Anna explore trees and scamper around like youngins do. Bonnie announces upon her arrival that she is with Harry on this one..”I’m never coming back to the ROCK. I’ve hiked here before and I never remembered it like this. Where am I?” John looks at the trail sign and says 10 miles to Rocky Knob??? What kind of sick game you playing here Lead Dog? No no it’s 1.0 miles from this point. You only got 7 more to go from there. Wewww. Anna makes a mad dash up the hill as if she might run to the top. Having no pack she’s gone crazy. She almost crests what she thinks is the top and sees it goes on and on and gives up to walk. The rest of us follow the long switch backed marked path and meet up with her. Wow what a view. Miles and miles of countryside. Finally we make it to the shelter. Now you’ll really have a view to die for. How would you like to sleep here for the night Herb says? He is liking this spot. Remember the AT used to come thru here so you have now walked some of the OLD trail. Cool yes? We take a group photo from a rock ledge that looks over the gorge we just emerged from. I’m not sure about the elevation but trust me you wouldn’t wanna fall the distance. I point out Buffalo Mountain and that a side trail can be taken to a better view. Down Down we go now taking ourselves back closer to the parkway. We pass over 5 or so parkway pull offs and read the designated informal signs. Lots of cars and cycles today roaring along beside us. How far till lunch? I was thinking about the chimney down in the woods but me having not hiked here since last year and not this exact way I can’t put my timer on how long it might take to get there. We better hold up here in this next field. Noonish so why not. Sprawling out under a big oak we have rocky slabs jutting up from the earth placed nicely for a chair back. We all pick one. Bonnie has baked banana nut bread and is sharing her bounty. Yumm yumm Herb as a bag plum full of peanut butter and jelly samiches. He wasn’t gonna go hungry. Sandman rares back against his rock, hands behind his head and says this is the best hike I’ve been on to date. Alright, now that’s what I like hear. I have to agree it is an all inclusive kind of hike.Taking our last steps thru the field we look over our shoulders for one last view before we head back into the woods. We pass the venue for Floydfest, stages and structures just ahead on the next hill. Camping here would be prime but the coppers would run ya off.   Rock Castle –the name sake of this whole trip. Majestic!There it is guys stacked to the sky. Rocks as big a VW bugs, a path cuts nicely amongst them for us to pass. Nothing doing but for Smalls and Tiny Pants to get a better vantage point. Up they go for me to take a photo. NO JUMPING. Come down seated, don’t fall. Next we reach the chimney. Woo and hour or so after we had lunch. Sooo glad we didn’t wait till now. We’d been starving. I know at this point we don’t have far to go. A sign will tell us just above where we cross the creek again. What do you mean UP? You said no more up!!!Trust me….Trail parking 2.6 miles. Then underneath give coordinates for each way, 5.6 to campground or 5.2 depending on which way you go. Let’s play a trick kiddos. I hold my hand over the 2.6 and when John, Herb and Bonnie come to read they see the 5 mile numbers and are a tad perplexed. They begin calculating so I pull my hand away and reveal our real mileage left. Cheers and hoorays fill the air. Sandman used to run 2.6 miles in 15 minutes so let’s do it guys. Let’s go. The wide open fire road takes us to smooth walking reaching the final bottom of the gorge making loop almost complete. Just a few more creek crossing and an old farmhouse to pass. More and more hikers are in this area enjoying the coolness of the gorge. One lady jumped back, startled by a snake. Anna was close by and thought she was jumping back from her. Ohh Ohh kids she thought. They bit! This big black snake was just crossing the trail enjoying its path such are we. Anna takes off again for one last sprint to the car. That’s it no more packless hikes for her. The rest of us enjoy the last few steps of the day. There’s our starting sign. You wanna go for lap 2? It was good but I don’t know if even I would wanna give that a go. Flipping around the forest gate Anna completes her day with a final gymnastic move. Now that shows what a wondrous place Rock Castle Gorge is. It’s so good you’ll be doing flips….Or you could just flop down by the creek and soak your feet with a cold beverage. Which ever you like don’t miss out on this hike","The Gorge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/410646,"Anxiously we await for our bus to come pick us up for our first train ride. We gathered at the 118A park-n-ride on a cool spring morning. 6:30AM Bus rolls in right on schedule 6:45, here we go stopping at the various other park-n-rides until we reach the Lynchburg train station.Choo-Choo the big long train rolls in. Where do we set? Which car? Does it matter? We walk to the front and hear instruction that the first car is the quite car so we quickly abort that idea and hit the next door back to find our seats. We have first picks and I get a window and the others gather around together. Traveling with on day packs we have easy use of the overhead compartments. Shortcut has all our trail packs and is in route north to meet us tonight at the Wingdale train station which is supposed to be just a ¼ mile from our hotel. John is traveling up separate as well taking his folks for a visit with their family along the way. He will meet us in the morning to start our hike. So, on the train we have Jimbo, Anna, TJ, me and the Captain. A mess of 5 to keep this train alive!We quickly make friends with our little passenger, Beckit. He is directly in front of my chair and pops up and down to chat with me. Before we know it he is right up in my grill telling me all about trains and his knowledge of them. Big brown eyes snap with excitement of his tales. Fiona, his sister finally comes out of her shell and is ready to show us around. They are traveling with mom from Virginia, have relatives in Pulaski and family name of the Allen’s from Hillsville, back to Boston. Wow what a hand full she has but they are regulars at this and each kid has their own pull suitcase and bag of toys for the road. This train is the way to go we all agree. No traffic stops, food and beverages are aboard for purchase or you can pack on what you like. See the country while we travel at speeds quicker than a car and then like lightening once past Charlottesville. I am a little nervous about our train transfer in New York. This country mouse ain’t to sure she’s ready for the Big Apple. Stepping off the Amtrak we say good byes to Beckit and family and fall in with the masses flooding out of the trains into NY Penn Station. Next thing we know we are in a mob coming from a Knicks games from the adjacent Madison Square Garden Arena. Chants of let’s go Knicks fill the air. We chant along. Standing street side now we scan the skyline, building have surrounded us. I pull out my map. Anna pulls up her GPS on her phone. We have our coordinates. 20 minutes walk to our next train out of Grand Central Station. Having 2 hours between trains sure is nice but we still are good footin it fast not knowing exactly where we are going. Wish they had some white blazes to follow!People and cars dart in and out of each other while we try to find our place. I feel like we need to hold hands to stay together. I sure felt better seeing the Grand Central Station building but once we entered I felt lost once again. Let’s eat and then see what shoot we exit into to catch our next train.My first beer of the day sure went down good with that piece of NY pizza but not good enough to buy 2. Did I just buy a 6 pack for that $11 I just handed over? Pricey yes.It’s 7:00pm and we leave shortly. Scanning the times of trains on the computer gives some confusion so I ask an attendant at one of the gates if this is our train. Chuckling at my accent I am sure he smiles and gives me two option, neither of which I’m sure of so a nice little lady getting the same details tells me she’d take this one and so I say Miss Patricia we’re with you girl. We have a little bit of a wait till our train comes in so we get acquainted. She is very familiar with the AT and has lived in some locations close to it. She gets all our trail names and asked how we got them, then just laughs. She is using this train trip for herself to get familiar with her route for an upcoming party she plans to attend later. Once on this last train my anxiety level finally settles out. All we have to do now is get off when Wingdale is announced. Miss Patricia will be getting off at Pawling, one stop before us. The last of the line is Wassaic, we’ll be on that one coming back once we get off the trail. I contact Shortcut to make sure she has our location and is settled in to our hotel yet. Yes and will be waiting on us for pickup at the train station. She informs me the hotel guy has no idea about our scheduled shuttle or car drop that I had talked to him about months ago. Several times I mind you. Ahhh my heart begins to beat hard once again. Damn IT. It’s 9ish now and we need to have this lined up before bed. Or at least for my sake before bed. I wanna sleep before our start tomorrow. Calling Bill at Dutchess Lodge he says we’ll talk when we arrive no problem. Good bye Miss Patricia, Hello Shortcut. We have arrived. Feet on the ground and ready for that second beer sure sounds good Jim. A quick stop at the only gas station in town and we pull up to the motor lodge. 10:00 or so and knock knock. A man comes down from a set of stairs and then directs us to Bill’s office. Looking like you’d look from awakening from a deep sleep Bill appears, shirtless in his finest Puma sweats. NOT. So Puma Bill can you get us to the trail, can you get our car at the end of the trail to be waiting on us next Friday? Uhhh I don’t know nothing about that? WHAT? AHHH? Still eyes half open he give us keys and says he probably can get it done but we’ll talk in the morning. Give me another beer…..","Virginia Park-n-ride

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/410797,"After much tossing and turning and did get some sleep before this morning. Shortcut and I have bounced around the idea of leaving her car to Puma Bill to drop off and we just don’t have a good feeling about it. I’ve put in calls to Big Lu at Bearded Woods and also to John to use Beth, his sister, as a back up. Pacing the room floor I await Bill’s return to discuss our situation.Packs are ready to go, hikers are ready for breakfast, so we head down to the local diner, Cousins. We fill up on food and keep eyeing the other selections in the deli cases. Subs, pastas, fresh pastries. We abstain and head back to the motor lodge to get this show on the road.Puma Bill has a fix, a buddy and he will do our car drop. George is familiar with the area in Salisbury for the car drop and will assist in direction. That will be $75 they say and we’ll take you to the Dover Oak. Sold!!!Stepping out of the car and finally seeing a white blaze my heart rate settles back down and exhilaration hits. It’s time, it’s finally time to hike. John is here waiting for us with Beth and his parents. Shortcut turns over her keys to total strangers and we only can hope we’ll see her car again in 6 days.THE DOVER OAK!!! There he stands, larger than life, branches stretching up to the skies. His massive trunk shall be measured to see if his girth matches that of our southern babe, THE KEFFER OAK. Anna and TJ help me stretch my same measuring rope around it. 1 time around and then we mark and have to measure some more. It’s looking like HE’LL beat her by a foot. To be exact it was by 17”. Keffer 20’ 2” vs Dover 21’ 7”. Well I be, but our gal has way more character I’ll tell ya that. It all seemed anticlimactic. Here we are finally at the Oak just getting started and yet we have another whole 6 days to see way more than we can imagine. I stand her alone staring at it and my troops have taken off blistering the trail in my wake. Wait wait for me. Some Lead Dog I am….It was quite cold starting out. A crisp wind cuts you cold when you stop but clear skies give us the needed warmth to really forget about it. Open fields set before us are lane with wooden boards called bog walks. This elevation of a little more than 600 feet keeps these low lands quite marshy so the trail maintainers have provided a nice board walk for us. When I think we’re out of the bogs the trail turns back into them. Wow check this walk out!!! We are about to cross this ½ mile Swamp River by way of a long footbridge. Imagine the man hours to complete this? Cat tails sway in the wind. Benches and wooden chairs are bolted on the bridge for resting along its way. We meet several folks out for a stroll and they are quick to question our destination since we look…well like thru-hikers. HAHA. We’re too fresh for that but we’ll play along just the same. When we say we’re from Virginia/NC out to complete all the AT in Connecticut we get high fives and cheers of encouragement. Was really nice. Smile Southern girl!!!Once over the footbridge we come to another trail highlight, the AT Train Station. We wanted to come to this station to begin the hike but would’ve had to back track to see the oak so re-routed our start spot. Maybe next trip we’ll come off the train at this stop. It has a small platform to step out on when the train arrives here only on Saturdays at limited times. New to this trip Captain and I have discussed having meeting points throughout the day. This way front runners can’t get too far ahead of the back runners. It’s a short day today of only 8 miles but with a late start we’ll be coming into camp about 3 or 4:00. Which is about when I like to arrive anyways. Time to get camp set up and for this night maybe a fire since we are still in the state of NY. Fires aren’t allowed in CT and camping is only allowed at designated campsites. We pass many side trails and steams. The kids pass the waiting time looking for creatures in the creek while the others catch back up to us. We plan to all meet up at one of the side trails called Yellow Trail for lunch. The kiddos and I are making quick work of this easy terrain. Very short hills and some rocky patches twisting in and out of tree cover. John is not far behind us bouncing between the lead pack and our ‘seaonsoned hikers’ Captain and Shortcut. Followed by Jimbo who is running sweeper today. Before we know it we arrive at the shelter. I toss around the idea of getting in a few more miles to shorten some of our longer days later in the week. But checking by vote of those in camp now that is a NO go. Let’s camp here so we can build a fire. Gonna be cold tonight, like upper 20’s burrrr. We have a nice big fire ring, plenty of available wood, good camping and water. John picks the tent pad area. Looks like a place for a dance floor tonight Sandman. What time does music start? He stretches out in the warm sun pulling his shoes off. “Just wake him up in the morning, Lead Dog” Camp chores begin as tents go up and firewood and water is gathered. Shortcut arrives followed by Captain and Jimbo. “A shelter, perfect, Jimmy says. “The good Lord has provided us with shelter I shall use it”. Captain and I elect as well. Come on in Shortcut you can pin Captain in on this other side. We girls will have him surrounded. Anna sees that the fire is going early. Some hot coals still remained and she give it a stoke and voila! Cook stoves come out like a hiker convention. Our picnic table abounds with foods. Pots boil and aromas fill the air. Here try mine, no try mine. Look out John your stove is still burning…as he walks away to clean his pot and various other duties. Captain hangs the bear bag line which by the way is so heavy we had to use a billy club to handle the pulling of it to secure around another. Other wise you’d cut off several fingers with the hold. Watching the flames fade while darkness falls on us a sense of peace has truley come over me. I am settled in on the trail. Who cares if it’s a tad too cold or if we have a car at the end or not? I will have a shelter over my head tonight and friends to hike with tomorrow and that is really all that matters.","The Dover Oak

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411012,"A cold night it was. I had trouble keeping my feet warm. Wish I had those damn down booties. Tenting was good for the kids. I had told Anna to put her rain jacket over her feet if they get cold and she did. John seemed to do well on his tent platform but I never did hear any music down that way.Early to rise with some sun and still a bit of a nip in the air. We are all excited about crossing over into Connecticut today. Heck by the way the crow flies we are just over the hill from the Dutchess Motor Lodge. Say reckon Puma Bill could find us for a ride back to Cousin’s for another breakfast?We fall into our pecking order and cross the CT line together. Let’s knock out this state my friends. Our first big hill comes up, Ten Mile Hill, Elevation 1000 feet. I know seem paltry but starting out at less than 500 feet will be a leg warmer. We’ll regroup at Ten Mile River Lean-to.Shortcut is having some delay today. Just not feeling herself she says. Ya’ll head on I’ll be along she says. Captain is not far from her either so they’ll be fine alone. Me and my little ducklings are up and over the hill in no time and at the lean-to. Funny it says Ten Mile River Lean-To and we’ve only walked 4 but it did feel good to set down in the sun. An open field out in front of the shelter was nice and provided an open view. We have now descended to the river which is full of mallards and other ducks. They dip their heads for fish while we watch. The rest come in with Jimbo rounding up the rear. Our wait has turned us a little cold so we shall move on while Jimmy decides to whip up a hot breakfast. This will put in a good 30 minutes or so behind us but that’s ok. He can sweep again today. Who knows Sandman might just need his tent picked up. HAHACrossing our first big iron bridge we now are beside the Housatonic River. Boy is she a rollin. I’m sure it isn’t full run either. Most of our trip will be along this water way and should provide a nice change from that deep in the back woods kind of feel. The Ned Anderson Bridge is a memorial to he, Sherman Farmer and the boy scouts who helped maintain the AT in CT from 1929 to 1948. Hey I was a Farmer, that’s my maiden name. Hummm ol Sherman may be relative. Another interesting landmark to our trip is an Indian Reservation, the name sake of our shelter tonight, Algo. The Algo reservation is down a dirt road we are walking now. They have signs up for Maze and other vegetables. Hope we don’t have to duck to avoid any arrows a flying. Temps are warming up now and we have another big mountain to climb, Schaghitcoke. Yeah you try to say it. Try when you’re out of breath too. Even harder. Shit, I need a coke sounds better. Come on John let’s get to the top of this thing and find a place for lunch. TJ and Anna are ready to shed some pants and have a snack. Come on guys you can do it. Rock steps and twists of the trail, I can see the crest John. I scan for a place to drop the pack but something drives me to keep going. Let’s just go on up ahead and see what’s around the corner. Sure glad we did. Check out this big rock ledge. Wide open for views off to Wingdale, our start and the rivers we had been walking beside. Wow can’t believe we just down there the kids say. Stretching out on a warm rock may not sound comfortable but you’d be surprised how quickly a tired hiker can fall asleep. Bodies strewed everywhere. Shoes and socks off Ahhhh. Shortcut and then Captain arrive to find them a spot too. Where’s Jimbo? Oh he’ll be along.Having only 3 miles left in our day we think we have it made. A piece of cake. Just some ridge walking, cross Thayer Brook and we’ll see the shelter. NOT I mean a big not. The ridge walked turn down to a total rock bar. Hell are we in Maine? TJ and Anna can’t believe it. What was once said, This is awesome, is now why put a trail here? My knees begin to beg for mercy as I start to side step down to avoid to pounding. Ok no big deal we’ll be at Thayer Brook and it will be all over soon. I see the water now. But wait the trail is turning up. What? Map doesn’t show this. We walk some more. More up. Then another brook, ok this must be it. Trail turns up more. This must be the real Mt. Algo. I can see the top Anna says but first can we get a snack, I can’t make it without a snack. By now I know my back pack is cussing me a blue streak. I’m sure of it cause my little ducklings are doing so under their breath. One last charge push and we cap ol Algo and see our shelter. There’s a stream right here for water and a guy already in the shelter resting. He is a SOBO hiker back on the trail after having knee surgery in 2011. A fit older fellow who is all smiles after going into Kent for a cheeseburger. Yummm I’d love one of those. We’ll cross that road tomorrow. Hope we can keep Jimbo off those roads to town. He’s always talking about running into a town for food. Wait just one more day and we’ll be doing that very thing to Cornwall Bridge for our care packages we shipped to ourselves. Sure hope Captain wants to tent tonight. He has my house and I have the kitchen. We are sharing some of our load. I’ll just withhold supper if he won’t and see what I get. Haha.Jimbo’s all about staying in the shelter and finds himself a spot. Kids set up their tent. John gets his up while I wait on Captain to arrive along with Shortcut. Hootie Hoot. We see them. They have made good time in the rocks and yes are cussing all the way into camp.My house goes up and then I help Shortcut with her’s. She is spent and ready for a rest and food. We gather along the outside of the shelter in the sun to cook. Mind you we are cool as a storm front in moving over and providing those crisp winds. Sure hope the rain misses us for tomorrow. Jim’s mom, Storm tracker and meteorologist, keeps us posted. Anna keeps on top of it as well with her handy phone. We had met a lady earlier in the day who had dropped off a German and Indian guy and here they come. They are carrying gallon jugs of water and way too much STUFF. Heck they even set up what looked like a single man bivy like tent in the shelter. Yep right between SOBO and Jimmy. Not good. Jim being the diplomat he is asked if they didn’t have good sleeping bags. Uhhh it’s not gonna be THAT cold. All but telling them, don’t put up your tent in a shelter!!Turning in for the night we are all pretty tired. This 12+ mile day has been a good but tough one. I hope we can convince Shortcut to hang in there. She is looking down the road at coming off at Cornwall Bridge Thursday morning. That gives us 1 more day and a few less miles so there is hope. Turning my head lamp out the sounds of night camp becomes more vivid…trickling of the brook, rustling of a sleeping bag getting nestled into. Oh and a purr from the Captain.","Wiley Shelter
",Mt Algo Lean-To,"Apr 22, Mon",12.40
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411041,"Sure hope today’s miles aren’t as hard as yesterday is the census this morning. The good news is the rainy front has moved off the coast but has left us with a cloudy cold day. Walking will be fine but stopping for any length of time will chill ya quick.We have many noted peaks to summit but they are stretched between beginning and end with a long river walk today. This should make for some easier miles. Hear that Shortcut, easier miles. Jimbo had a colder sleep than the rest of us that tented. He was a bit slow this morning and said for us to hike on and he’d catch us after his breakfast. I’ll track ya down on Skiff Mtn he says. The descent from Mt Algo down to Kent Road was long and pretty steep at the end. All the trail did here was bring us to access to town and then turn right back up again for several rocky climbs. First that ol Skiff Mtn, which by the way didn’t seem right crossing without our Slim Jim. Second was Caleb’s Peak. He gave us views over the Housatonic once again and some pretty homes on his banks. We could see the town of Kent as well and all it’s church steeples. Say wonder if we could get a gin and Housatonic down there?Burr the wind is cold on this cloudy day. The trail turns us off these peaks to St John’s Ledges with it’s 91 steps down to the river. We didn’t count but was 91 or more for sure. Now you might imagine wooden steps or a few rock steps then trail. No all rock steps, some layed out even and some with set down and scoot off of steps. Pretty tricky. Sooo glad they aren’t wet. White marks are all over the trees and rocks to lead the way. Almost 500 feet of elevation lost in this section. It sure felt good to finally step on the forest floor again. Dirt, leaves, trail anything but rock please. We are set to meet up at the River road which will be a good place for a snack, maybe an early lunch Anna says. I lay out my tyvek out for my kiddos to have a seat on with me. Watching the next ridge come and go with the heaviness weather we sure are glad to be here instead of there. The river is just across the road from us making it quite chilly. Anna and TJ decide this will be their lunch stop while I have my mid-morning snack. Soon Captain comes along for a rest. When Shortcut come by she is on a mission. No stopping for her she is off to the next shelter for her break. Too cool to stop now and she’s feeling pretty good and wants to keep it rollin. John comes by and isn’t much on stopping either so he and the kids move on out. Just when I ask if anyone has seen Jimmy he pops around the corner. ‘What a wonderful day for a hike’. I made it over Skiff Mtn unscathed he says. Did ya’ll see those rocks back there? Good Lord.Road walks, huh, every time I’ve been on one my feet hurt more. Yes you can make good time but mile after mile can get quite boring. From dirt road to river side trail and then back to dirt road the trail led. Blazes were few which always gives a sense of did I miss a turn. Lunch was good at the little shelter along the river. Camping spots were abundant here, flat. I have noticed since in CT where campfires are prohibited that every shelter or camping area has had a fire ring. And yes chard wood was in them. Not sure when and how this is policed. Next stop Silver City or that’s what we called our little spot in paradise. And what would paradise be without some work. Yes we must climb over 500 feet to get there. YOU CAN DO IT! John leads the way, sure hope he doesn’t miss the turn. If he does the next road will stop him but that’s a mile farther. This increase in elevation will make for cooler camping. No shelter here to break the wind either. Just a big pavilion open on all 4 side with picnic tables under it. Very nice for large groups. Lots of flat spots for tents too. Look a swing, the only one on the trail by the way. And a large open deck area with benches surrounding it. Man, wish this was a hot day I could catch some rays. Only cloudy and cold now. Instantly everyone is hustling to get their tent up and getting inside. Captain tried to put on all his extra clothes to keep from it. He knows if he goes in he’ll not come out. John has his castle up and falls asleep almost instantly leaving all his gear scattered outside. Anna says she won’t come out and that TJ will have to cook. Another hiker comes in. Mike from Brooklyn, trail name Milo. He asks if he can join us. I chat with him on the deck watching the clouds try to part. Warmer temps are on for tomorrow we just got to make it thru tonight. Deciding to warm myself a little before cooking supper I join Captain in our tent. We’ve lowered it closer to the ground to keep the wind out. Makes head room nil so you have to back into the tent to get in. Now that’s a sight in itself. He has done so already and is in layers of shirts, coats, hats and gloves. Zipped so tight his farts couldn’t get out. Well that’s a lie cause one did and I like to have died. I can’t laugh for choking but try anyways. He gets hot and tries to come out and is trapped. You should have seen him trying to get gloves off so he could unzip jackets all while laying zipped in a sleeping bag. Again I am laughing so hard I can’t breathe. Help me Martha, Help me he cries. Warm now time to cook. Say Martha hears my bowl and spoon will you just bring it to me? Yep Captain is still in that tent retreating from the cold. Jimmy asked where he can get a Squaw? It will cost ya Jim I don’t come cheep. A new trail name maybe? You’ll have me tomorrow ol boy when Captain jump off the trail and I’ll need a new home. Will you cook for me too?Supper goes down and so do the hikers. No need to come out and watch the clouds part. They’ll just have to believe us Milo. We watch the weather break and talk about going into town tomorrow. He has decided to join us. The more the merrier I say.","Mt Algo Lean-To

It’s to town day and we are anxious. We’ve been out of camp each day way before 8am and now running the clock back to 7am. We hardly took the time to get one last ride on the big swing. Food packages, a REAL breakfast and who knows what all is to be found at Cornwall Bridge and the only thing between it and us is a 1 mile walk. Who knows we may be able to hitch a ride…Standing at the road we all gather together to make a mad dash to the other side to get out of the curve the trail brings us down to. A sign tells us something about the crossing at Guinea Brook, which is where we’ll come back to after town and begin again. We don’t have time for such details we got food to get to. Shucks we don’t even take the time to flag ride.You must be Lead Dog from Virginia the owner says once hearing me speak. Yes sir I am. My eyes looking over his shoulder at the menu on the wall. Eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, any type bread you’d like. I’ll take it all!!! The boys look for a place to charge their phones. Oh look they have Italian subs, meatball subs and and and I can’t read any more I’ll be out of money. We had already stopped by the post office and see they will open at 8:30am. So we grab some breakfast samiches and take over the seating area inside. It’s still a little nippy outside but the skies are clearing to blue. This is shaping up to a great day. I scope the parking lot for anyone driving a pickup truck. They will be the prime option for a shuttle back. The others pilfer the rest of the place like kids in a candy store. Ah ha I see just who I will target. A fellow who is getting his morning coffee and paper chatting with the owners must be a local and that’s his truck outside. Say mister how would you feel about give me and my bunch a ride back to the trail? A big smile and chuckle he agrees. We need to get our packages from the PO can you give us a minute? I’ll give you more than that he says, he needs to run down the road to pick some supplies for his work and will be back in 20 minutes. We scamper across the road between the general store and the PO. Boxes torn open like Christmas morning. Food every where. Humm I don’t wanna carry all of this. An empty box soon turns into a hiker box, which means anything you don’t want becomes community. Take what you want leave what you don’t want. Milo who joined us in camp last night has become one of our group now. He cam to town with us and plans to hike on with us for a while longer. Seeing all the goodies going into the box he helps himself to some extra provisions. Come on guys our ride is back let’s load up. Now for the really sad part. No it wasn’t that we had to leave the store and other foods, it was having to leave our seasoned 2 hikers behind. Yes Shortcut and Captain have decided to get off the trail here. Today’s upcoming 13 miles and tomorrows 14.5 have helped them make up their minds not to continue. They will track down Shortcut’s car and come meet us along the way. I know some trail magic just might show up with them out there. We all give them big hugs. Here Jimmy take my squaw and take good care of her. Waving from the back of the pickup truck we’re headed back for the trail. Thank you! Thank you, mister for the ride. Guinea Brook awaits us…Where do we cross? I don’t see the marks. Anna spots them way across this big ol creek. To me a brook is something clear, slow moving and shallow. This son of a bitch was moving like our Stony Creek and with not much stepping stone room. We ponder. Jim and John go out half way by rock hopping to an island area but no where to go. They return. Milo leads us up the creek to what looks like 2 downed trees making a V across the water. Maybe we can shimmy from one to the other and make it across. We proceed.Milo goes first and makes it over. The trees are low enough if we feel off you would go far before getting wet but wet is something we surely don’t want. I’m next. My pack is heavy now from new supplies and I’m not as steady with it on as before. Weight shifts can thrust me out of balance real quick so I move slow and grasp the tree with my legs like a wrestler giving a take down. Straddle scooting inching across it’s time to stand up. Milo gives me a hand. I’ve made it. NEXT!! John, Anna then TJ. Jimmy rounds up the rear and gets all the smack talk. Come on frogger? Don’t fall. Watch the splinters. Smile. The birdie flies and he is across. Wow if that doesn’t get your heart pumping nothing will.Hot baby Hot. The sun is full on out and we have that adrenaline flowing. Stocking up on water and stripping off layers we are now ready to get our hike on. Over and over we go up 200 foot climbs for retreat back down and do it all over again. Making really good time we hit our first big up, Pine Knob. It seemed to go on and on. The sun baking us. Hey let’s take a cool off at the little water fall? Anna has been dying to wash her hair and this is prime spot for it. Just kneel over and stick your head under. Feels great. Each hard pull keeps adding to the day. Thankfully we have several long stretches of easy trail to help us recover between them. We also take several breaks to take off out shoes and cool in the streams. Lunch was especially nice by a little creek. My sub was extra good with Italian sauce running down my arms as I crammed it in my mouth. Here Anna have some tomato and cheese. TJ helped me finish the ends. John and Jimmy both knocked out all there subs too.Next up is the Lemon Squeeze. A rock pass thru just big enough to clear with your pack. Look a bobcat, John says. What? You’re lying? Yes I saw is it too says Milo. What where? I’m just getting ready to cut into this rocky pass way with no way out and a wild animal is around!!! Where? A big buzzard comes out next right at my head level. Hope he isn’t gonna peck my eyes out. He retreats. I move on thru. Everyone else comes forward. We all gather and look around from above where the cat was last spotted but nothing. It has disappeared. Let’s hike to this next shelter and take a break. We can rest up before knocking out the last 5 miles. I can hear how the heat and the miles are starting to wear on everyone. John especially. I’ve noticed he has dropped back a few times. His pack is pretty full, carrying lots of extra water and food now. His tent oh boy his tent. Well how many times have we asked if we need to secure it a little better? It is now within another stuff sac, hitched with 2 more bungies and lastly Milo has hooked a big fat carabiner to help hold on. It continues to bounce against him with every step and that adds weight. Coming into the shelter Sandman crawls to the back of the shelter running from the sun. Pulls off his shoes and says ahh. TJ works on his feet some too. A few hot spots. Jimbo christens the privy. That sausage and peppers sub has lasted just about all day. It’s the meal that keeps on giving. Belter Belters where are you? We continue to cross pesky 100 to 200 foot climbs. Just when you think you are on the top and might see out the trail takes us back down. Where’s the hang-glider view? I bet we pasted 5 hills which we thought would be it. NOT. I see the race track for Limestone. John has had it. No more stopping for him. You guys can go up and down these things faster than me. He charges on as we take one last break. I know I’m ready to call it a day. The last mile of any day is tough but when it’s the 13th or 14th its hard. Finally the trail turn off the backside of Sharon Mountain descending 500 feet. Rattling off the numbers as our knees take the pounding we get closer and closer to our camp. Ha, John is setting up off the trail in the woods like a steamed little kid told to go to his room. ‘There’s no shelter!’ He demands. Not supposed to be John, just camp sites here. Humm.We go into the designated area and pick our spots. Here Jim lets take this one, it’s the first one, who cares what’s best this is closest. Surrounded by tall dark pines we have pretty good wind protection. The spots deeper in even better wind block. Good we can cook down there. The winds have picked up but thankfully it was a warm afternoon. Time for a warm bath with my cook stove and pot of hot water. Look out Jimbo this squaw is taking over the teepee. Water gathered, everyone bathed, good food and good fellowship. Milo and TJ had a noodle cook off eating at least 4 packs of different noodles sharing their flavors. John was too tired to cook and went with hot chocolate and varies snacks. Jim and I hung the bear bag.Turning in right at dark we have stayed up our latest night thus far. Even with a long day I’m feeling really good. A warm night to fall asleep with is wonderful. Jim and I discuss the option of camping at 1600 feet tomorrow night, out last night at Riga Shelter. If these winds don’t lay we may just have to abort that idea. I don’t want to as this shelter is supposed to have the best sunrise of all in Connecticut. All we can do is just wait and see. The lights go out in Belters headquarters.","Silver Hill Campsite
",Belters Campsite,"Apr 24, Wed",13
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411755,"Well we had a some visitor come in last night. I was almost sound asleep listening to my music when Jim says someone is here. Head lamps dart light in and out of our shelter as people pass us by. They are looking for campsites and are reading the posted layout of the area. Pellets of rain pop on the tent now too. Humm hope that stops. We here them go on up the hill to the top sites. Their voices fade off as do I back to sleep. Rain did come more during the night but only for about 30 minutes. It was 1:30. I slept the warmest of the trip and was ready to roll early. Having another big day before us getting an early start is best. The troups sorta know that and are easly awakened as I walk by their tents giving morning reveille.Another cool brisk morning with clear skies. Hope the wind lays as we progress so we for sure camp on Riga Mtn tonight. We did get word from Captain this morning that they did retreive the car. It was parked at another spot on Rt. 41 but found it no problem and are staying with Miss Maria McCabe. I had already lined her up as our hostel stop for tomorrow night. Perfect they'll already know where everything is in Salisbury. Reaching our flatlands again we are back beside the Housantic River. Road crossings and some weird trail travel basically take us down and around a cornfield to only bring us right back to the road we started on. We could have walked the road and cut off some steps but hey it was pretty. School is in session and this little intersection is a buzz with cars. We stop and salute the American Flag as first bell rings and the pledge of allegiance is played. I thought this part was supposed to be flat? Anna questions. She is learning what the map reads isn't necessarily what the trail does. These short steep ups and down beside the town are hendersome. Our legs are still weary from yesterday and need time to get warmed up. Just wait till we climb Prospect Mtn, that will get them going.Ah a Housantonic please. She rolls to our left now and we are moving closer to our first landmark of the day, the Iron Bridge over it. The trail spits us out in an openig, a grassy lawn to the Hydro Plant for the town. There's supposed to be a shower head outside one of the buildings that hikers can use. Too cold for that now. Say look an orange car, is that who I think it is...Captains hat moves and then I see Shortcut get out. They have come with trail magic. Dunkin Donuts. 1 dozen is soon down to 1 left. Cheers to them. Happy to see us and us to see them they tell of their evening at Maria's and getting the car. Shorcut collects our dead phones and chargers from our luggage already in the car and will charge them and return to the trail where we plan to meet for lunch. Sodas sound good for that stop. Captain takes our order. All this action and it's only 8:30am. Come on guys we better get truckin. Crossing the big bridge we head up to Falls Village and a wide water fall area. This would be a prime place for a long break along the water setting on the rocks. The trail turns us away from civilization and towards Prospect Mtn(1475 ft) Wew this is gonna get our blood pumping. Time to shed those layers and get watered up. Johnny boy is on his mission to get out in front. Look out we got a runner. Hot soup Hot soup coming through!! He disappears up the switchbacks. Ok Lead Dog get your hill pace on and get us up this thing Jimbo instructs. We fall into place. The long switchbacks are what I was hoping for. Just like at home. I can do this. Soon the rock slate becomes the trail but still not that steep. We crest and see John resting against a tree munching on some trail mix half smiling. We can rest long due to the cool wind still blowing. Clouds come and go keeping the warmth from truely settling in for the day. We come off this mountain only to return back up to 1200 feet for Rand's View and was a ""G""rand View it was. Our first big valley view like at home. Mountains surrounding the distance and a wide valley cutting a path miles wide. Wonderful!!! We go back up for Giant's Thumb. Humm wonder what exactly this will be? Bascially a large rock standing alone in the woods which really looked like a big...well...dick. Come guys lets get a picture NOT. No one wanted to stand next to that. So I just snapped a shot for the record. Our pelliton just keeps moving like a colored up centipede winding along the trail. John's off in front once again and I've taken to the back position taking more pictures today. Billy's View is next. Another climb up for a look out over Salisbury. Large white homes dot the mountain sides. Again we don't tarry long for getting chilled even in the sun. We are to meet up with our trail magic crew at 1:00. It's only 11ish now. 3 miles to go. We'll make it with time to spare.Milo and Jim are now setting a quick pace. If foods involed Jimbo has a whole nother speed. Milo is just a good hiker. He's only been following in with us and taking his time. I can tell he's much faster than we realize. Anna and TJ are just behind me while John is up between me and the guys. I have stopped a few time to take on and off a long sleeve when I get cool. Sweet sunshine is now full out and I'm loving this. Feel like real Spring. I take a photo of yet another rock row fence. I haven't told you about them but they have been abundent since we hit the trail. Every mountain has them along the way and even at the top. I can't imagine how much work it has taken to build these and over so many miles. It's incredible. Down Down we go. I can hear a road. Steep Steep rocky steps with even a wooden ladder to climb down. We have to be close to a road with this hand made luxury. Back at 700 feet once again. Rt. 44 and major highway. A field runs just parallel to it. Jim and Milo have found a nice sunny place by a fence post marker for a rest. Only .8 of a mile to meet Shortcut and Captain and we have an hour to get there. Shoes off and head's back Ahhh this is nice. Hard to believe we have already walked 10.4 miles. We got this!! TJ works on his feet some more. Blisters are building but not killing. John how are ya? You're quite dude. Just catching my wind and glad to be out here. Milo was going to stop in Salibury today but has decide that Riga Lean-to sounds pretty inviting especially with all us up there. He will get off the trail in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. That will be an 18 mile day for him tomorrow. WEW. Jets cooled and bodies warmed let's go get that soda. Field walk turns right into town walk. I sorta like this. We pass a community cemetary, wind back into a field pass behind folks houses, down a side street and then cross Rt. 41 and see the orange car again. Soda Soda, pop pop, down the hatch. Say lets drop extra stuff we don't need for the rest of today, tonight and tomorrow. Slack off as much as we can. No tents, no extra food. Ditch it all says Jim. That hiker box just got full again. Shortcut pulls out the box and we run it over the side. Milo scavanges again for some goodies. Help yourself. John's quick to check his phone and get connected back to cyberspace. Me I'm all about culling out my food bag to only carry dinner and breakfast for tomorrow. Anna and TJ can't believe they are leaving their house with Shortcut. He wanted to shelter last night but wasn't one. So tonight is it. John don't you wanna leave your Marriott? Nope I have a tv in there. It's high def. We all get a good laugh. Fortified and lighter we are truely motivated to tackle one last challenge, Lion's Head. Oh boy our biggest climb thus far. Over a 1000 feet elevation change but we have 2.5 miles to get up there. 3.4 miles to our shelter so it will be most of the trek left. John's off to again to get a jump on things. The duckling settle in behind me and we are off. Milo and Jim follow. Turns out this stretch isn't killer until we get closer to the top. Rock steps in bunches weaken my legs. Trail comes back then more rock steps. Say Milo how about some happy tunes to get us up this last pull? We stop and get our funk on. Beat box and thump thump. We are rockin this place out. OK CHARGE. Knees pump and sticks dig in. One last rock face to climb with toe holds on roots. Dig baby Dig. Hey Johnny boy. He sets in a shady spot tapping on his cell phone sending pictures of our view. NICE. Salisbury down below us. Can't belive we were just there. Anna and TJ pose for some great shots. Here get me too. Now this IS hiking I say to myself. Hard work to get to a grand view that most never see. It's special let me tell ya. Bring on Riga.I can't believe it's almost here, the shelter with the best view of Connecticut. I can't believe we will have all but completed the state and this is my last night on the trail. The path meandors along this ridge giving us a glimps of Bear Mountain our highest point (2316) which we'll climb tomorrow. With just a little over a half a mile the trail crosses several steams even at this elevation. They aren't trickles either. Look the camping signs and the shelter we have arrived.Even after walking a 14.5 mile day I don't feel as if I have. Yes I am ready to rest but I don't feel whipped. The excitement of the view and upcoming sunrise make us drop all sensations of exhaustion. We all plan to sleep in the shelter and await the beams of light to fill its walls. Tyvek lines the bottom of the structure, sleeping bags go on next, it is full to the brim. Glad we dropped those tents behind on the way up we say. Jimbo is extra light now and I'm betting will run off this mountain tomorrow since town is the destination. John elected to tote his tent but aborted the idea of tenting and is joining inside instead. He lays down on his mat right away for a rest. Look a big green coleman sleeping bag. Someone has left it behind. Humm I think this will make a nice ground cloth for us to set on here out back of the shelter so we can catch the last of the evening sun and cook our dinner. Camp chore get done, water gathered and a nice sponge bath for me in the stream just below the shelter. Water rushing over my feet felt mighty good along with fresh camp socks to warm them once clean. We do have to keep long sleeves on and some hats due to a slight breeze. Turn on some tunes Milo lets get the party started. Aromas of hot teas and hot chocolate yummmm. Pass the juice around it's the last night on this mountain and with our our new friend. We hate to bid him good-bye but he has yet another day to walk before coming off himself. An 18 mile day mind you. Sprawled out on our green blankie I look to the skies with thanks. We have dealt with some cold temps, dodged rain, climbed many a rock hillside, and met some mighty nice folks. Ahh life is good. Say John you wanna come in a set? ""No I'll just lean against this tree here. If I fall over just cover me with some duff"" Haa haa. If you don't know duff is dried leaves and such you scoop up to put in the privy hole after you finish your business. Now you can really laugh. Finishing cocktails over supper we soon begin winding down for bed. Food placed in a bear box provided. No bear sighting for us but town has had many and we have been warned to keep things in a secure box. Places everyone. We snuggle in before dark. It is getting cold. A clear night always provided crispness. Here kiddos we'll drap this coleman bag over our feet. Just enough to stretch from TJ over Anna to me. Sorry guys you're OUT. Milo is next to me against the right side. Say if I roll over just spoon me and I'll stop snoring. John is beside TJ and then Jim against the left side. John has already began is purr. Out quick still wearing his glasses. Bet so, he is laying on a twin mattress, big enough for Anna and TJ both to lay on side by side. SWEET!! The sun fades out. Wind creeps in over my shoulders. I withdraw deeper in my bag and drift off to sleep.","Belters Campsite

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411780,"Peeking out from my sleeping bag light just starts to peep. Ohhh how cold it is. Only my eyes and nose are uncovered as I raise my head to curiosity. TJ is doing the same, 5:00AM We prop our heads up so we don't have to strain our necks and settle in waiting. Milo begins to move around and get situated for his perspective. All other asleep. Pink light, twilight. Beautiful. Not a cloud in the sky. Slowly she comes up we start for our cameras and better vantage points. Oh man that means coming out of this warm bag. Yikes. Putting all I have on I get to my post ready to snap photos. Milo and John follow suit. Jim is deep in his bag along with Anna who is now awake but not wanting to test the morning. Rays of sun soon fill the shelter like a spot light. Jim raises up to only get punched in the face with it. Damn who turned on the light he says. UP time for town. In a moment he is up and beginning to pack before I can even take my morning constitution. This sunrise has put us all on a different schedule. Man packing is easy when you shelter the kids say. No tent to tear down just roll and go. Captain has already phone in to see what our eta will be at the pickup point, Rt. 41. 10AM Jimbo announces. Come on keys this train pulls out at 6:56 sharp. We have a few miles of the AT yet to walk including that big climb of Bear mountain and then will loose Milo as he continues and we cut off connecting to 2 side trails and that will be all of our journey. John double checks the mileage today. He is ready for a short day and we are as well. 6.2 guys we go this.Crossing more streams and passing another shelter with campsites it is rather nice this early hour. We warm quick and shed layers. Even pass some early morning trekkers too who have come in from where we shall finish. Wow they got an early start too. Riga Junction #1, that's the first path to come off Bear Mtn but we'll keep going as we want to come to the second junction so we can say we have walked all the AT miles in CT to the Massachusetts line. Milo lead us up the ""Bear"" of a mountian why don't ya?!Rock sheets are the path on this side. It is graded so not steep steep but we are moving up in elevation. 700 feet worth. Short stubby pines line the path blunted by the harsh winds that have to blow up here. Sorta a tunnel we are in following white blazes under our feet on the rock. Milo and Jim are scooting followed by me and kids then John. Climb Climb. We should come to a large structure of rocks like a pyramid. That marks the summit I tell them. The pines open up and there it is..Bear Mtn. Milo is already on the tippy top, hand raised in celebration. 1st big climb for him today and all before 8am. He will have 2 more of equal highth before his 18 mile day is to an end. Come on Anna let throw him off his perch. Grrrahhhh, Girl Power!!!We have a quick snack, breakfast really, We moved on quick this morning so grub is on the go. John gets the coordinates for our next junction, Paradise Trail. That is where we turn off and hit then Undermountain Trail down to the parking lot. Go Go, Go Johnny Go. Jim and then Milo proceeds then me and the ducklings. Down Down baby this is mean. We thought St Johns Ledges was tough, this is much steeper and no good foot holds either. Slow and steady we make it down tactfully stepping easy to assure good footing. Wow this will bust some knee joints. I'm sweeting. With a few butt scoots and grunts more we make it to flatter trail. Yes! Don't forget to turn at the junction John, Riga to Paradise we holler out. You'll end up in Massachuttes man. Before we know it that's the place we be. There is no sign for the CT/Mass line but we do know trail info say it is 50 yards past the Riga Junction/Paradise Trail. Dropping packs we head down 50 paces following Milo to say our good-byes. Declaring a white blaze as out spot we give him a hug and well wishes. 3.2 miles left for us. Jim and Anna are off to the races not to be seen again. John, me and TJ are left to the rear. I don't hike back here much so these last few miles I shall enjoy this new perspective. The Paradise trail did offer too much. Winding thru head high under brush gave us a trapped in feel. The same view doesn't give you the sense of moving along very far. A few streams to cross and we do met a couple hiking to Bear today. An older 2 that are from CT and happy for us an out accomplishment in their state. She tells me only a mile to our next trail turn, Undermountain trail. These 2 miles on Paradise have gone on forever. Stopping to take off my last layer gives TJ a chance to get out front and try to catch Anna and Jim. No chance they are too far ahead for that. We'll let them young ones run John. We'll hang back and enjoy this last part of our trip. Soak in the moment so to speak. John is pretty quite now. I'm feeling he is running on fumes at this point. When I asked him last night if he'd be back to hike with me again, the response was ask me in a couple of weeks. A fair answer and I'll do just that. Coming to a campspot and a small side trail I pass it and after a ways begin to wonder could that have been our turn off? Surley not. There would be more of a sign than that. I know the map show Undermountain trail connecting to this trail down a ways but where is it. On and on, finally I see a small turn in and then we connect to a fire road. Hey John this is it. Back a ways from me he yells 'the junction? the road? No no we have to walk another mile to the road. Johns head turns back down to the ground and continues to come toward me. When will the end, I think he is wondering. Descending quick elevation the fire road finally hits the bottom of the mountain. The parking lot is close. Meeting more hikers coming our way is always a good sign. Again I look to the skies in thanks. I hear Jimbo and the kids. Hootie hootie from the Captain. I have made it, I have done it, another state is complete. John rolls in shortly behind me while Jim exclaims we have a lost senior citizen up the trail. Yep Shortcut has gone up the way to meet us and hike back. Damn we get you people off the trail and you just keep running back in, he says. Well we didn't see her. Humm. Wonder where she turned. Laughing at the situation we look up in a few minutes and see her little self coming our way. I took a turn and missed you guys but hey I got some miles in she says. Happy that we are all back together again we cheer our accomplishments. Now who gets the shower first?","Riga Lean To

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411816,"What would a trip be without meeting new friends. You've already heard about our train friends and trail friends now you have to hear about our welcome to my home friend, Miss Maria McCabe. I think she said she was 82 but not for sure. She opens up her house to hikers year around for a place to shower and bunk. She provides fresh farm raised eggs, breads and bananas. If you need condiments and such just ask she will provide. Born in Austria she was a young girl raised in a time where Heil Hitler was the morning salute. Speaking both Italian and German you can still hear the strong ascent in her speech. ""Calm een, Calm een, yooo crazy steenky hikers"" she would say. Grab a towel and take a bath, bananas are on the table. Living in the heart of Salisbury she is close to the road 41 we hiked down to and the one that Shortcut's car was originally parked at. If you are reading this journal and need a place to stay she's your gal. CHEEZEBURGER, CHEEZEBURGER got to have one. Instructing Captain and Shortcut to do some sleuthing on places to eat in Salsibury they have gone on the recommendation of Miss Maria to hit Mizza's Pizza. Burgers and beer for lunch after coming off the trail yesterday hit the spot. Then we had a return trip there for pizza, pasta, and more for dinner after lounging in in Maria's yard soaking up the last of the evening sun. What a treat.Train time now. I've lined up a shuttle from Bearded Woods Hostel. They are a town away and Big Lu is coming to get us this morning early 6:45am. Big Lu turned out to be a Little Lady. hahaha Yep a gal about 4 foot nothing and might have fit in my backpack. She and her husband Hudson own and run the hostel. She cooks and provides shuttles and much more. Telling us of all her adventures and Hudson's she has made many runs to Maria's house for shuttles. They know each other well.Dropping us at the trail Wassaic train station we are on our way back home. Train Train take me on out of this town....Back to Grand Central our walk to Penn Station was a breeze. We cruised the city streets like we belonged here. Well maybe not, but at least we felt more comfortable. Stopping in a shop or 2 we found a place for early lunch while the streets seemed much more calm than our week before. A slight delay at Penn Station got our nerves up again but once on board we discovered that our train IS the reason the bus runs and she don't leave till our train arrives. Cool no worries. Besides this train will run like 95 mph and make up any time necessary on the way. The train emptied as we progressed home and by the time we reached the Lynchburg station we had our cart just about to ourselves. So if you are considering a train ride, DO IT. What a way to travel. Easy, cheap, fun. What other way can everyone eat, drink and ride AND be picked up and delivered ON TIME.Our Smartway bus turned Short Bus in Roanoke. Again the passenger count dwendles. Just us 5 now and a lone soldier to be taken to the 118A Park-n-Ride. Boy are you in for a treat. We plan to play fart baseball. It's a hiker thang. Mr. Bus Driver you wanna play? Who's on first? Captian! Ah I'm out. Who's on Second? TJ! Ah I'm out. And it's an in the park home run, Captain rounds the bases. And that about wraps it up from buses, trains to crazy hiker games.","Rt. 41 Undermountain Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415501,"Here we are back at Hot Springs to finish that last section of 40+ miles. Buddy Coonhound is along for this hike so we have elected to camp along the river. It’s a cool afternoon but some sun has hung around to keep the chill off. The winds have blown what was left of the rains and heavy skies out. We pretty much have the place to ourselves. Just a car or two down the way at other sites. Bath facilities close and being just back from the waters edge we have some protection from the chill. I put my tent up in a flat spot while Jim is pondering his options. Looks like he might just sleep in the truck bed and let Buddy have the cab. Humm wonder whose boss of this twosome?We get a fire going while Jim finalizes his pack for the hike. I’ve had his gear since the trip to CT so he has much to sort out to take for our next 3 days. I’m excited about tomorrow. We have to make a decision whether to hike 17.1 miles or pull up around the 15+ mark. We’ll just have to see what the terrain holds and how we feel. Getting a long day out of the way will make the last day shorter. All the best for us since we’ll have a 2 ½ hour drive back to Damascus. We left my car at Tom’s this morning, loaded down with Trail Days goodies upon our return Thursday. We’ll get a shuttle out of here in the morning leaving Jim’s car in Hot Springs for us return to.Fire crackles. Brats and veggies yumm. Macaroni salad and a good cold beer. We chat over our itinerary and settle in for the night. Big day tomorrow and shuttle leaves at 7:00am. Good night Buddy Coonhound….Yooodddlllle.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415502,"Up and at’em by 6am we are ready to go meet Daniel at Bluff Mtn Outfitter for our shuttle to Sam’s Gap. He had us to the trail head by 8am which will give us a good head start on our day. Not wanting to miss one white blaze we walk back from where Daniel pulled off the side of the road back to where we left off last trip here. It may not be important to most but it was for me and Jim. We both had the same idea when we said good bye to Daniel. Fresh and clear morning. Feels like springs. Plush green grass lined the path. Flower Flowers, white trillium dot the landscape which turn to groves of trout lilies then Mayapple. I do love Spring.The trail is quite forgiving. Graded ups with switchbacks just in the right places. Did Bob Peoples lay this trail? Easy or not I can tell you I notice I have been off the trail for 2 weeks. Legs are a bit fatigued on our first climb. To early to burn out just yet. My pack is a little heavier also now that this squaw is carrying her own tent. Buddy even has his own pack on. Still leashed to Jim he can’t roam too far. We have 3 big pulls today Hogback Ridge right out of the gate (Elevation 4255 feet), Frozen Knob (4580) and at the end Butt Mtn (4750). All of which have at least 700 feet of elevation gain to 1650 feet. I meet 2 old guys coming up as we go back down a piece of the trail. Gulliver is my name and hiking is my game his says. They have come from Hot Spring. Going as far as they can go, loaded down old school but experienced. When I tell them I’ll be ½ way done with the trail after this trip I get a knuckles from ol Gulliver and he says they have left me some beer at town, they didn’t drink it all. Luckily our first too ups are early in the day and we decide to have lunch at the half way point, Devil Fork Gap. We saw this road crossing on our way in so seems a good place for a break. Turns out to be a happening place for sure. You name it stopped in. Hikers needing a ride out, hikers needing a ride in, coon hunters looking for their lost dog to dogs looking for lost masters. I have found a partial sunny/shady spot under the big oak in the grassy field. Jim has gone on close to the tree to tie Buddy of for his rest. Cars come and go over the road crest. A hiker chick has called Hot Springs for a shuttle out. She is sick and has a pulled groin muscle. She is also waiting for a fellow hiker to catch up to her too. Overload is his name. He has a lost puppy hiking with him and is slow catching up. We are to tell him she is getting off the trail and will come back to pick him up at Sams Gap. Another hiker gal comes along with her doggie. Buddy make friends. One tall lanky guy comes in with no more than a day pack on his back. He man where’s the rest of your pack? I holler out. He laughs and says that they way to go. 20 mile days and nothing to sway. Say Jim can you make me one of those? Baum Proof Gear will be on the market soon I am sure. Lastly the real show stopper was this hunter who rolled past in his truck loaded with dog boxes like the coon hunters use. He screeches to a halt and hops out saying ‘Say is dat yoor Walker Dawg? Looks liiike mine. They wonder off ye know’ Jim quickly lets him know Buddy Coonhound is a trail dog and not his Walker. Say where ya’ll hikin too? He asked. When we tell him we have another 8.5 miles to go and yet to climb Butt Mtn. he was like…Shoot ya’ll better hold up at Flint Mtn Shelter. Butt Mtn is too long. Ya’ll better get to scratchin to make that. His southern draw was stronger than mine and I understood every word. He is right we had better get to movin. 2:00 now. We expect to arrive about 7:00. This rest has felt mighty nice. Temps are warming quickly. We better stop to get water before the shelter and that last big climb.Again the trail is very forgiving but not so that I’d wanna carry too much water up Butt mtn. We have been told there is some on the top and take a chance of that. We reload but not so we are burdened. More NOBO hikers are coming down now. Some are headed to Flint Mtn Shelter which we just past. Their knees buckling under the pressure and our hearts pounding to get pressure. I was felling pretty darn good till now but this hard ass mtn is taking the life right out of me. Buddy even drops off my heels. Here in the warmest part of the day and no shade on this forest road is taking a toll. Damn I could down a Sunkist about now. Water, Water.   Another set of hikers come down and encourage us to the top, it’s just up there. The crest, finally, then what is this, a grave site? Yup I can believe. The climb killed them too. Butt Mtn was a beautiful place. Grassy ridge with a giant fire ring and 2 campers there. Water is down that way they say. We are too tired to even care. Jim dismisses the instruction, half mile off the trail they say. Oh hell no we ain’t adding 1 more mile to this day. Here Buddy you drink out of this mud hole. I think to myself..could I?The trail turns into a field, a wide open field, wow I could camp here too. 2 more miles to go Jimbo. We are spent. We get a quick snack and Buddy lays down beside Jim while he checks his cell for service. We are too high up for the signals I say laughing out loud. The evening sun comes in, God help me get there.Jerry Cabin is active with hikers. Shelter is full and all tent spots are pretty much full. We head straight for water and when we return our 2 options for tenting are down to one and we jump on what is left. Buddy instantly makes friends with folks. They do love them some Coonhound. He downs 2 big bottle full of water and is ready for more. Can we do this again tomorrow Jim asks? Now no but ask again later and we’ll see. Resting a minute before dinner buddy has curled up on his mat and is out for the night. Jim is gonna cowboy camp beside him and I have put my tent just beside them. There is a small fire ring but we are too tired to gather wood for it. Let’s just cook.Now I’ve been cooking for quite some time on my little stove. Cooked for me, cooked for Captain, cooked for Shortcut why not cook for Jim. Pots a boiling here ya go. I get my meal to boiling and cut off the gas. Pick up my pot and then reach to move my stove and shit my down coat is stuck to the prongs. Goose feathers begin to fly, Quick Jim get the duct tape. He thinks I’m on fire soon to be melted away. He can see it now, first the coat them the tent, poof nothing but a smoldering mess. My coat is officially broke in!!","Sam's Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415658,"Man was I tired last night. Took me a little while to totally drop off to sleep. Had some hip pain and aches that just kept on. Finally took some medicine and drifted off. Gonna be another long day. We plan to get in 15.4 miles.We’ve been told from the NOBO’s that the trail will be rocky from this morning and if we want a view take the high road. If not take the low road. Firescald Knob Junction gives us the option of going around on a blue blazed trail to miss the exposed trail on the ridge line. I’m sure in the winter this may be the best option but for us we don’t plan to miss our white blazes.A path heavy with stones and rock which cut narrowly between the shrubs makes for tough walking. Just enough room to pass this would be impossible with deep snow for sure. Gonna be a hot one today, glad this breeze is happening. Erwin TN is down to our right and look Firetowers!! We’ll be going by them soon enough.Wow this rock gap doesn’t look easy for Buddy to get up. I go first scrabbling up with toe and finger holds to its top. No sooner that I turn around to help Jim with him than Buddro is right beside. Two hops and he’s up like lightening. We were concerned about Buddy’s leg last night. He has some swelling in his left front leg. Like a tendon has some inflammation. He held it up when first getting up this morning but worked out his stiffness just like us. Good trail dog!!Arriving at our first fire tower, Camp Creek Bald 4750 feet, this will be our last big elevation for the trip. Don’t you worry we’ll still have some pulls but none this great. We have a snack and I work on my feet to make sure they are clean and no blisters working up. I chose to wear my non gortex, red racers, and they have done great. Feet coated with body glide, dry socks and ready to walk – this upcoming down will be a test on us.My legs begin to ache, Jim says his foot is feeling the stress too. Has since put Buddy in his nose halter which keeps him from pulling so. All approaching hikers are barley moving in the heat and making their climb. We have it best heading down this time. Coming off 2500 I’ll be glad to reach the bottom at Allen Gap. We have lunch a little over half way down at another shelter. Reload with water and cool in the shade. Two hikers come in, one on this way to Maine and an older guy out to complete 500 miles. He has hiked the AT before a few times and just comes out as he can. Retired fellow and well verse on the trail. They tell us of a place to visit at Allen Gap called Mom’s. They just opened in the last week and have sodas and ice cream. Oh hell yeah…we are all about that. Sure enough a sign on a tree points us in the right direction to Mom’s Store, we can see it from road crossing and head on down. A small run down cinder block building with old Winston signs and such. A big red emergency type light twirls in the window like a beacon to call us in. Ice Cream, come get some Ice Cream. $1 will by each item in the store. Cash only. We dig in our packs and pull out our dough for Orange Crush , Cokes and cold cream. Yummm it was heaven. Resting in the grass beside the store a fellow comes over to chat and give Buddy some water he has in his truck. A chatty guy whose walked all the trail around these parts. He gives us coordinates of our upcoming 4 miles to Spring Mtn Shelter. Don’t miss this turn and don’t camp here or there. By the time he talked us to death for 20 or so minutes I felt like I had already hiked them 4 more miles. Wew that dig out of Allen Gap and the Deep Gap was trying on us. Today’s 15.4 miles felt every bit as much as the 17 we did yesterday. Smoke from the shelter fire hangs heavy in the evening woods. We pick out tent spots on the ridge going in with all the other hikers. Many up here too. Buddy quickly curls up in the leaves for his pre supper nap. Ahhhh. Jim and I gather water from a sparse source. Many had said water was bad but really not. You just have to gather from the right spots. Nothing a little ingenuity won’t fix and a leaf or two. I put out packed in cokes from mom’s in my water bag to chill while we get camp organized. They will taste might fine with a little Jimmy Beam and grub. We look around camp for a fellow called Fast Eddie. We met a friend of his on our way up from Allen Gap, Sir Stops A lot. He had some cough drops for him and asked us to deliver when we pass. No Fast Eddie here they say. He was last seen taking a nap at a firetower we’ll come to tomorrow at Rich Mtn. Visiting some more with other hikers we have some laughs at dialect. 2 Europeans trying to understand Tennessee twang along with Carroll County was quite the show. The hikers here are great fun. We chat about going to Trail Days and what that is all about, Captain’s zipline and our hiker feed and of course the moonshine that lies ahead of them. There was even a couple honeymooning. They came in from Hot Springs and will go back out tomorrow. Jim and I had to laugh when they said we’ll be walking together. Hummm took them 2 days to get here and they plan to hike it all in one. Well be getting an early start in the morning. With Jim cowboy camping again he’ll be packed quick and Buddy even quicker. Hahaha. I do believe Jim’s a little upset that Buddy is out cowboying him tonight. No mat for this trail dog, he’s still nestled down in those leaves. I can’t wait to walk across The French Broad River tomorrow.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415673,"Up in the morning and out to hike. We busted out of camp by 6:30 while everyone was still sleeping. Burnin daylight folks, move it, move it, move it!!! The honeymooners tucked deep in their big ol tent didn’t flinch as we hiked past. Nope won’t see then today Jimbo.Buddy was a tad lame at first limping and stiff while moving from his bed. Even laid back down to get a little more attention at first. But once Jim caressed his head and strapped on his pack ready to go.Shoot Jim was limping a little too. His foot still hurting from yesterday and we have this down and up and then ALL down to Hot Springs to do. OK you bunch of Sissys. We got miles to town – LET’S GO!!! I have to admit I’m a little tight myself but once warmed up feeling pretty darn good.Fast Eddie never showed last night so we are out to find him today and deliver those cough drops. Remember, last seen at Rich Mtn firetower taking a nap. We doubt we’ll see any other hikers before Tanyard Gap our half way point. A few ups and downs and then a big pull to Rich mountain that seemed to wind around the mountain forever but better than a direct line up so I’ll take it. Look the town Lead Dog. Are we here already? Hey is there a doctor in the house? Jim hollers up. Sure enough a man peeks over the tower rail. We go up to visit. Fast Eddie is here with another couple. They have spent the night up in here. The wind blows and is quite cool. Look, the river, I can see the French Broad. Cool. We give Dr. Eddie his cough drops and tell him we plan to leave a note at Devil Fork Gap to let Sir Stops Alot know the deliver was made.3 miles down and not even 8am yet. Off to Tanyard Gap about 4 miles. An easy hike it was only meeting 1 fellow right when we approach the gap. His hammock has broken and looking for a ride back to Hot Springs. While we visit a truck rolls up and hikers jump out with trail magic. Cokes and bananas and sweet cakes. Yumm I’ve been starving all morning having just finished my tuna fish samich. They leave more for other hikers. THANKS GUYS!Jim is quick to pass the word along to all we meet heading north. We really start to see more now too. The pilgrimage out of Hot Springs, those loaded with new supplies and hiking UP baby UP.A little under 6 miles to go and I am pumped. Speaking of pumped we gotta get over one last knob, Pump Gap. Looks pretty steep on the profile. Shoot we are immune to such. Just put your head down, get the feet on the ground and climb. Once over Buddies been haltered again with this terrain. Jim’s feeling it in his legs as Buddro pulls to keep on my heels as we descend almost 2280 feet over the day. Lovers Leap overlook is fast approaching. I recognize this stretch. I worked on the Konnarock crew some years back and we did trail maintenance here. I can’t wait to see it all. Feel good to come back and walk over what I helped build. The big French Broad stretches out thru the valley. Running full to the brim. I stand gazing at it and the town of Hot Springs. In a few short minutes I’ll be on that bridge. Come on guys lets go.Crumbling rocks under our feet make the last mile slippery. Jim asked who did this shotty work? Ya’ll need to build this up. Locals come up to see out as we race to get to town. Finally down by the river you can feel its power. She is truly BROAD. Closing in on the bridge I feel my heart race. This is it, my half way mark in trail miles complete on the AT. I can’t believe. I step over the guardrail beside the highway and walk across the bridge. With each step I reflect back to when I started sectioning. When I first decided this was something I had to do. It’s a hard journey and I like it that way. Ain’t that right Jim? If it were easy everyone would be doing it. Now can I finish the rest? Damn straight I will, just a matter of time.","Spring Mtn Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415834,"After some trail time it’s always nice to roll into Damascus for some Trail Days. Thanks to Tom and Sandy Davenport we have a place to congregate and enjoy the weekend. Taking over their yard is what we do best. This year we have 5 camping tents and 2 big tailgate tents loaded with food and beverage and grill facilities. Sandy always provides good food each night while Tom puts on a show strumming his fiddle. Trail Days wouldn’t be complete without a visit or two to tent city, a place where thru-hiker can camp outside of town. Fields and wooded areas are chocked full of tents, tarps and signs. I’ll let you browse my photo gallery on that.Hiker Parade – well that had its rollercoaster this year. Dressing up and loading our water wagon and guns is always a blast. We gather at Sun Dog Outfitters for free hotdogs in their parking lot awaiting our signal to fall in line for the parade. Hikers are the rear of the event. Water shoots from guns and kids line the streets to get a shot in at us. What was fun and games turned to shock and puzzlement. A car comes from our right rear running out of control into the line of hikers beside of us. An old man driving has a blank face, staring straight ahead, both hands locked on his steering wheel. Froze in time, as if he didn’t know what he was really doing. His car stops just beyond us on the bridge, a lady trapped underneath is pulled out as hikers come to her aid lifting the car. A young fellow in our group, Matt, was one such hero. Rescue working comb the area for hurt individuals while we are herded off the bridge. We retreat back to our camp. Needless to say the tone of the day shifted from elation to heartache.To a lighter note we’ll bring those costumes back out again next year so we can fully christen them in the true nature of the hiker parade. Speaking of christening…. I made the wall at the local library. A collage of old trail days photos was posted in the entry way. Yours truly was marching along with my buds in the parade from 2010. You just never know where you’ll see me. It’s like being Harry. Taking the rest of our day back to tent city and it’s events we closed out the night by the fire ring, drums thump and flames fill the night sky. We’ll see ya’ll next year guys.","Hot Springs

Did we really just feed over 100 people? The Captain’s yard was the place to be this weekend that was for sure. Beginning Friday night he kicked off the event with a fish fry. Cool Cooking Kenneth pulled out the deep fry vat and mixed up his magic and dropped in Stony Creek Trout, Mahi Mahi, French fries, and hush puppies. Fixins were wrapped up with ‘pink’ slaw as one hiker put it. She had never seen carrots added to a slaw. Girl you been missin out. Yummm! Good ol corn bread washed down with various sodas, brews and that special mountain elixir.Kathy (Captain’s sister) and I counted 37 sleeping structures in the yard and 69 hikers. Is it just Friday? Lordy we may just run out of food. Thank goodness Miss Janet and Baltimore Jack provided some extra goodies for helping out. She rolled up in her party bus from Erwin TN with 20 hikers and packs loaded on the top rack. I bet it hadn’t been barely dusk and they broke out their hotdogs for roasting over the fire. Now that was oh about 2 hours after they just filled themselves with fish. Oh Lordy I say again.Music, fire and family. Yes a hiker community has sprung up on the creek.

Can you hear him out there? Sure enough Buddy took release and went for a hike. Jim was off to run him down before breakfast. Damn the bad luck. Canopies stand ready lined up with tables underneath and then a Big Ass Tent for the band. Yep the Captain has gone all out this year providing us with some Honky Tonkin. Captain’s sisters (Mary and Kathy) prepare the ‘family’ breakfast inside the house so we can get fortified for the big day. Biscuits and gravy, I’ll have some tomato too!!!Minute by minute more hikers flock in. The yard fills full. It’s gonna be a hot day. Folks already in the creek for a wash and swim eating their big bowl of cereal passing it around like little kids do to share. Milk does a body good.Reinforcements come in, here comes Bonnie with those famous west nile beans. Wonder how long they will last this year? Coolers line the way stacked full of beverages for the taking. Jim and I had squirreled them away so we’d have some for today for everyone. Grilled aroma filled the air as Bonnie and I begin the day. 11:00. Hikers line up even before the first burger is pulled off. 30 deep, 40 deep. They keep coming. Plates in hand buns open with condiments spread thick awaiting that juicy piece of goodness. Cheese please. Hurry Bonnie they are circling closer and closer. I’m gonna have to put a rope line to keep’em back. LOL Jim, Dustin, Matt, Bill and Captain run frantically in and out of the house to replenish the food tables. Shirley, Mary and Kathy have been cutting up tomatoes, onions, and lettuce as fast as they can go. Save me some potato salad I yell out. Beans, what beans? Gone baby gone, 10 minutes tops empty. Good thing Joe from Four Pines shows up too. Deer burgers and pork loin. Yum Yum. Noni and Denny, Ian and Dana come in with side dishes, desserts and salad. In a blink of an eye, poof, gone. Bonnie and I take reprieve from the grilling area and get our lunch. I’m pooped. Hot baby hot over there. Captain reports we have just cooked half the hotdogs and burgers in an hour and a half. We cooled off in the shade watching the corn hole games heat up. Hiker Olympics up next.What would a hiker feed be without an afternoon thunder boomer? It came at a pretty good time too. The band just had gotten all their instruments and sound systems safely unloaded under the big ass tent. Lights too. The rain passes and we gather the hikers in the middle of the yard. Let the games begin!Backpack Scavenger – Let’s see who has the weirdest stuff in that pack. I run off a list from tabasco to feathers to soap. Hiker chick had 14 items out of my 31 called out. Ben and Jerry’s for you my dear. Second, All About Aluminum. You have 30 minutes to create something from Aluminum that is Trail related and original. Teams form and ideas run wild. Hikers dress up themselves to their animals. Frank was top dog, literally, winning the contest as a dressed up hiker dog with armor on his paws to his parts. An Egyptian Goddess emerged with fresh fern to cool himself and a tall palm tree made of aluminum can. Super Freak guy with tattooed guns around his waste shorted on his skivvies wrapped in aluminum and a nice bra to match. A real piece of work he was. Beer Bongs and Aluminum thongs yikes.The next 2 events are truly hiker related, stinkiest shirt and hairiest legs. Hey girls can play too and they almost won. Lastly we did our Limbo game which a quarter of the field participated but it came down to a tall hiker and Giggles. Giggles pulled out the last limbo winner herself a pint of Ben and Jerry’s.Let’s get this party really started and the band played on. What a treat by the Captain to provide a live band for this crowd. The yard turned into a concert as the music filled the holler. More mountain elixir passed around and as some hit the ground. With the band winding down for their last anchor hikers jumped in the air with every beat of the drums and guitar strums. Those still lasting joined Miss Janet fireside for one last round of food, roasted corn on the cob and pit baked potatoes. I can smell the goodness now.Sunday, time for clean up and tent tear down.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/422165,"Now I know why I don’t hike so much in the summer. Hot baby hot. BUT I wouldn’t have changed a thing but for going for the whole weekend. That’s what Slim Jim did. He got his shuttle Friday from a fella called Deer Hunter, got dropped off at Bearwallow Gap for a hike to the James River on his quest to complete all of the AT north from Roanoke to Waynesboro before this fall. Petites Gap is where we jumped in to meet him on his last 10 miles out. There he stood on the forest road #35, clothes hanging in the trees to dry at this early hour. Buddy was tied to a tree waiting too. He was anxious to see if I had received his message for a boat load of Hardees biscuits and cokes. Yes I got but thought it was quite a large order and a joke. Now I would come empty handed even for a stranger. Steak biscuits and others and here’s your drinks and buddy’s water. Buddy up on is hind legs begging while Jim gobbles down his half. We got the details of his last 2 days out. 12 miles Friday to Bryant Ridge Shelter where he set up his tent on the shelter platform profusely apologizing to any and all hikers coming in. This shelter holds 20 so plenty of room. Bugs were bad he said so a tent was a better option than tarp.Day 2 was a big day of up and his legs were tired he said. Thunder Ridge is a big climb and Floyd Mtn prior only makes it worse. Hot and humid so drained the life from him and buddy too. They camped just past the shelter so his walk to meet us was only 2 miles in stead of the planned 4.7.After first lunch/breakfast trail magic it’s time to roll. He left the remaining magic for his friends he met last night, Milkshake, Farmer and Clip Springer. They will come this way on their journey and have a treat. I’m load least today, like 4 pounds. Haha Yep wearing my fanny pack. I really look like a day hiker. Maybe I could have pulled off a trail runner but I’d have to lose my sticks and move much fast to pull that off. The bunch is ready to kill me when they put on their regular packs. Jim has no choice since he has his home and life on his back for the weekend. But coming just for the day TJ and Anna were like man we should have down sized. Of course Anna did have a Kroger bag full of groceries. Bonnie starts throwing out her rain jacket and any extras to lighten her load too. Heading up our first an only big hill today we can feel the heat and humidity of the mountain air. 10:00 or so now and it’s like 70s going on 80s. No wind just us panting from lack of exercise since our last hike. High Cock Knob was Hard. Hahaha hence we changed its name to just that Hard Cock. Jim had taken a picture of what he called dutch boys pants aka Dutchmans Britches which was really Columbine. We see a big patch right off the bat going up. You can’t mistake it for Dutch Boys pants for sure. Winding to the top of Hard Cock I was sure glad not be carrying Jim’s pack. He was ready to get it off and cool his back. To hot for this he said. Glad there’s been water along the way and have the River at the end. I start recalling some of this trail from past hikes this way. All the side trails I’ve walked at one time or another to connect to the AT. Sulpher springs side trail and yes it runs yellow and stinks. Belfast trail which runs over Devils Mableyard. The kids ears perk up, they wanna go. Miles of boulder scramble will have to wait another day. Besides Tiny Pants is already entertaining himself and us enough with his Darwin discoveries. From finding salamanders in the creek, taming bees, and crawdad collecting he is our own little naturalist. Watch out you may be called Darwin from now own, NOT. Oh and Anna just might get a new name too, Tats. She’s got another tattoo. This one of mountains. Nice, I do like it. We couldn’t get to lunch quick enough and take a break. We’ve walked a leisurely pace stopping often at water sources and giving Jim time to hike his hike but with the heat shade is welcome along with a log to set on. Bonnie’s been running sweeper and crests the little ridge with a smile seeing we have stopped. Half way done guys. Buddy tried to lay down twice before arriving here so he is really ready for a nap. Jim hardly gets his pack off his companion before Buddy closes his eyes. A random lunch I had with a half made tuna wrap, partially tampered with chips (I think Larry or Skyla ate half of them laying out on the counter last night after I went to bed), no snack food, I usually have a trail bar or something sweat. NOT. No rain jacket, and I hear it rumbling. I’ll just get wet. Water bottles that I’ve been filling in the creek. Yep I’ll get wormy for sure. Free wheeling that’s what I’m doing. Out for the day and in by the night. I hope. It’s all down hill from here folks. We take a hard right off the ridge following the AT. Belfast trail led on to the Marble yard, I’ll bring ya back. Look out Riva here we come. That storm rolled around us and the sun popped back out. Vast views swallow us up and keep us wanting to come back. Down down. How’s your feet holding up TJ? He wore his slippers today. Old worn out Toms and no socks. The heals were even out of the back with a break from their soles. Wow. Didn’t seem to affect him. I myself couldn’t wait to stick my feet in the creek and I was wearing my new trail runners. Love them by the way, Salomon rocks. Matts creek was a happy site marking not only 2 miles left in the day but a place to really cool our jets. We kicked off our shoes and everyone stuck their feet in. I could stay hear all night. Buddy took another nap. We watched minnows in the shallows and wiggled our tootsies under the current.Flat ground to walk out, nice. Look the River Jim hollers out. He made it he made it. The James River bridge, the longest foot bridge on the AT. Pretty cool and right here in Virginie. Anna asked me what my favorite hike was. That’s hard to say but it is easy to say which state is the best, Home, Virginia. Right here in our back yard. We trot across the big bridge winding down our day while others are just getting some fun started. Sun bathers, kayakers and those daredevils gearing up the nerve to jump off this structure into the waters below. Nope not for me. We’ll just watch thank you. Oh and they did jump, a couple of girls and 2 fellows did the leap of faith. With a cold drink in our hands we give Jim a toast and Buddy too. Another section down. Stay tuned for the next edition of Slim Jim’s Journey to Waynesboro.","Petites Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437312,"Finally…hiking season. It’s back, I’m back, we’re back. Even ol Larry is back. Yep It’s HIS HIKE. He planned this little adventure. He wanted something short with a view of fall and be close to water and a shelter. Close drive time too as he loves his football games and getting back home on Sunday for kickoff is imperative. So we browsed the maps and I gave him some options to meet his requirements and here we are…parked at road fork of Rt. 42 just past Level Green’s big White Church. TJ and Anna are already here awaitin. It is Larry’s hike ya know and we are on Larry’s time, late. We still can’t get here at noon. Doesn’t matter I get to hike and I’m happy.Putting on our packs for the first time since June sure fells…well…heavy. We aren’t loaded down by any means but knowing you only have 1 night in the woods sure makes it easy to add just one more item or 12, heck it won’t matter. NOT…Larry is already wondering what all he has put in his pack since I have the 2 man tent and food. The kiddos are going to try out one of Captain’s tarp tents and see how they like Henry Shires version. Hope I can remember how to pitch it for them. Stepping into the field to begin our hike I see the marsh has expanded out from the little foot bridge we must cross to keep our feet dry from the stream below. Hurry Anna I’m sinking standing here deciding which way to walk to miss the worst of it. The beavers built there home just to the right of the bridge and backed up all the water forming a wetland. My right shoe almost sucks off my foot to be left behind in the muck. Shit let’s get out of here. Wet feet, we all have wet feet. Some more than others. Larry brags on his trail boots saving him from the worst of it all. Water squished between my toes and we’ve only be hiking 10 minutes. Glad we will have a fire tonight to dry our shoes out and it isn’t freezing today. Moving up thru the open field and over the first of several stiles we all are happy to be here and looking forward to our night in the woods. Heavy are the skies with a 10-20% chance of rain. I sure hope it stays that way. Temps are actually just right for hiking, we aren’t sweeting and walking has helped our feet warm from the cool marsh we started in. Wonder how many hikers we might see tonight Anna asks. I’d say 50% chance we see some SOBOS and a good chance we’ll have company at the shelter for the night. Wow some hiker must have a good time out this way. First a Mad Dog liquor bottle was spotted then Fireball. Then closer into the woods and in view of the grazing pasture along a deer trail and hunter path 2 liter beer bottles. Man somebody had to hit the wall out here. We place each bottle in sight of the trail so we can collect on our way out tomorrow. I’m thinking the fellow that left his Schlitz toboggan along the way must have had at least one of these beverages for his own. Hey Larry how ya doing back there? The hill begins to grad sharper upward and he drops back a little behind us. TJ keeps close eye on my heart patient and we gather a few time so we don’t get too strung out. I too can feel the hill in my legs and chest, heart beating up in my head. Gotta get those lungs and legs back in trail condition. Anna agrees as she takes a deep breath. Sure enough we meet a few day hikers that have already been to the knob as we close in on the location of the old Blair Witch house. It has since fallen in and all that remains are lap boards. The trail seems to swallow us. Branches, undergrowth and briars intrude. It has to be from all the rains this summer making things grow way wild. Sorry to say the colors aren’t prime but they are in their peak now. It is still pretty just the same. Laurel Creek is just up ahead but not running a full as you’d think. We rock scramble across it and wind under the laurels coming up to the shelter. We just begin to unload our packs and have a snack with a train of SOBOs come in. Hungry hikers they are having hiked from niday shelter this morning to here (12.4 miles). They plan to camp at Wind Rock tonight (23.1 mile day) WOW. And that ain’t easy hiking. Anna throws out her bag of pretzels and they add them to every version of their lunches. Pepperoni stacked with cheese, peanut butter all wrapped up in a tortilla topped with pretzels. Yuuummm I think? Baltimore, Texas, Chicago states represented in this bunch. 3 guys and a gal followed by a Pineapple (the other hiker coming behind them later) Who by the way never did arrive. We assume he passed the shelter without us knowing later in the day. We wish them well and tell them to be sure a see the Captain which they have heard about and are excited about the zipline. Tents go up and firewood is gathered who’s ready to hike to Kelly’s knob? Wait who’s coming? It’s a white dog, where’s his master? Shortly he arrives. Jeff and Casey, they have just been dropped off at 42 where we started from and are out for 250 miles which will take them to Hampton TN. Jeff is from Maryland and has moved to Maine after hiking up there and decided that’s where he wanted to live. Now resides in Brunswick Island. I can see this will be the perfect OUT for Mr. Larry, no Knob for him he has company to entertain. I breakdown my backpack for slack packing and let the kids lead the way. They go extra light, no sticks no water no nothing. Only a mile or so up and they ain’t worried. Hey Larry be sure to get that fire going so we can dry our shoes when we get back. TJ was thinking along the lines like I, if we take our shoes off now the warmth we’ve generated in them will be lost and would take too long to dry out before we could start up. Now I wouldn’t recommend this if I hadn’t already experienced this when hiking Shenandoah in 11 straight days of rain and in BOOTS. This is a cake walk compared to that. Bring on the KNOB.Anna is quick to tackle her slope and we follow right along. My legs burn. TJ skips just behind her. We are closing in to the crest, a cool wind greets us. Yep always wind up here. I sure hope the SOBOs stay warm at Wind Rock. They don’t call it that for nothing ya know. 50 feet Kelly’s Knob, the sign says. Trees open up to the giant rock slabs stack one on top of the other. Foot to 2 foot wide gaps between just enough to make you second guess how to leap across. Anna goes, then TJ goes, then…well…Lead dog goes…yikes. I haven’t rock hopped out to the far end of these in years. The first time I said I never would again. Well, never say never. Video time. Something knew guys. I have been following a gal from the Harrisonburg area, Robin Bledsoe, who is dedicating hikes for every fallen Virginia soldier who has given the ultimate sacrifice while fighting in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. (203 soldiers) So today’s hike to Kelly’s knob was dedicated to the VA soldiers of OEF. TJ recorded me and Anna while we put our flag down and said our piece. You can view on Facebook, Hiking for Virginia Fallen Heroes. Robin will be providing soldier names to me for upcoming hikes. So if you’d like to join me in a tribute just let me know. Gibby joined us on Kelly’s knob too. He is hiking north and plans to spend the night with us at Laurel Creek. He came by the knob while we were taking pictures and video. He is from NW Louisanna and sounds like he is from TN. Just retired in May and picking away at the trail just like us. He will come off at Troutville and take a bus home. Getting chilled it’s time to head on back to camp and warm by that fire Larry’s got for us. TJ is quick to say he can’t wait to put on dry socks, I second with my crocs. Look guys, blue skies. Half way back the clouds part and evening sun comes on. Hearing voice and smelling smoke the shelter is close. Gibby and Jeff have picked each side of the shelter for their bunks. Casey greets us with a smile and a wag of her tail. She likes hikers. Snack time and cocktails. Sizzling socks and warmed up crocs. Now this is hiking Larry states. All while he tunes in his radio for the college football scores.Night begins to fall and the wind picks up a tad but just enough to fuel the fire nicely. We get to know our shelter friends a little better while warming by the fire and eating our various meals. TJ by far was the most versed in that, eating remnants from everyone’s pot. Next time we come here it’s steaks and roasted jalapenos stuffed with cheese. The vote is in.Stars peek thru the trees and last…the massive white sphere rises…the moon. Like a spotlight from above it illuminates all the woods. Hiker midnight has already come for our friends and we are soon to follow. Lights out sorta…","Rt. 42

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437314,"Well last night was pretty uneventful. Only the man in the moon to watch over us. He made our tent light up periodically going and coming from behind the passing clouds. Sure hope the kids stayed warm in the tarp tent. Much more ventilation that they’ve been used to compared to mine. Way more room too. TJ was like wow this is a house. Anna should have had loads of room to sprawl out. Temps might have hit low 40s. All I know is Larry and I listened to the last of the Notre Dame game dropping off to sleep.The fellas were up in true hiker fashion having a warm breakfast, packed and out on the trail by 8am. We are again on Larry’s HIKE so we can sleep in, bring the fire back to life and warm our poptarts before hiking out. Waiting on the sun to come up and warm the woods we did just that. Say ya’ll wanna hike on up after we come out to the Keffer Oak? What about Cascades on our way back home before we stop to eat at the New River Grill in Pembroke? Nothing not even a node of a maybe from the group. Larry has spoiled them. Well it IS HIS HIKE. So we bust camp and head out to our cars. One more hill to climb and one last marsh to cross. Man I don’t want to have wet feet Anna announces. Me either girl. Maybe we can walk out down that old farm tractor drive I remembered seeing over the years. I really didn’t pay attention to that on the way in. Wish I had now. Wonder if it is still there?All the empty bottles we intended to pickup on our way out were gone except one. Larry packed it out. Guess the college kids we saw coming out yesterday got them. Good for them. Even the boggan was gone. Wish we could just keep walking today it’s sooo nice. A perfect day for a hike no matter how short. Yes we did get our feet wet again. No road to follow out. All grown up now. TJ and Larry tried to help clear some of the beaver dam. Well TJ did the work and Larry was the safety supervisor. I will report to the trail crew in this area so maybe it can be fixed. Squish Squish we walk up the road to our cars already talking about were to next. Yes the season has begun…","Laurel Creek Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437687,"Just me and the old man today, the heart patient, the twit. He once again picked our destination and time of departure. Don’t get your hopes up that THAT will keep happening my fellow hikers. I ain’t sleeping half the morning away and strollin around in circles on some short hike barley breakin a sweat every weekend. All kidding aside it was a wonderful hike and I truly enjoyed sharing some time with my hubby.The Cascades is the perfect couples hike as a fellow hiker just told me, Slim Jim. And there were many of those here today. One even proposed to the other at the falls. Very nice. The parking lot was sparse when we arrived but filling when we came out around 1ish. I like coming here too to break in the legs again for the hiking season. Heading off for an 8 to 10 miler right off the bat can be a little taxing on the legs and lungs. 4 miles works well. Starting on the lower trail is the norm for us too. Electing the stream walk up and the fire road out. Hard to believe the elevation gain is 700 feet. Larry says, well the AT would feel like 1000 feet every ½ mile. Why do they take you up to just go down? At least we have a water fall to climb too? Meandering along the creek we run into some fly fisherman spotting their catch but just can’t figure how to get down to snag them. We trek on up to an easier vantage point where the stone trail backs right up to the water’s edge. Larry picks out 2 native trout. Can you see them? Tiny black spots on their backs blend in to the creek’s browned bed. Only the faint red tinge on each fin helps me spot them. The rushing falls are heard up ahead. I’ve seen it fuller and I’ve seen less. Needless to say it was much colder tucked back in this holler so we didn’t stay too long. Just long enough to snap a photo for a couple and then make a tribute to 2 fallen soldiers. Yes I do plan to keep this going for as long as the names keep coming my way to honor our troops. When Robin hears from the families she then passes along that name to me to tribute. So if you make it to the Cascades look for their flag placed on the second tier of the corner railing. Again you can see my video on facebook.Walking back down the fire road was a breeze. Overcast skies cleared to a bright blue. Fall was in the air for sure with a cool northwest wind. Some yellow sections from turning leaves gave light to our way. Thank you my dear for hiking with me today.","Pembroke VA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/438072,"I couldn’t have been more excited to get my hike on than when Harry called and said pick me up at the airport I wanna hike. When a buddy will fly in for some trail time now that’s the bomb. Now I’m not slighting my regulars, not even you Cardiac Kid – that would be Bonnie’s hubby Jeff, who wasn’t trailer trucking. He was on the fence making sure the mileage was within his zone or he’d disintegrate. Harry came up the river this morning in his flying machine landing at the New River Airport in Dublin. As I was pulling up he pranced out the doors pack and sticks on his back ready to go. Wonder if he packed his lunch?We met up with the kiddos, Bonnie and Jeff at Craig’s Creek leaving the kids car there. Jeff was quite confused making sure we had cars in close proximity to the trail in case he might need a rescue or option for turning about. Yes Jeff we’ll have your car at one end and mine at the other..No No we don’t have to walk back to here. Lord that would be some day. We left his car at Craig’s Creek where the trail crosses the road and drove down to Trout Creek. Tj was anxious to see what this new section would have for him. This will tie the Dragons’ tooth section together with what we are doing today and Niday/Sarver area. Everyone checked their gear since we won’t be coming back this way. Jeff you got your keys? “Yep but I left my water in the car” We gather up some left overs in my car to manage him 2 water bottles for the trip. Anna and Tj are sharing a pack so they are hiking light. Yo Harry what’s the story on the ‘new’ tennie shoes today? Classics Baby. You need some pom poms to go with those. Ra Ra Ree Kick’em in the knee, Ra Ra Rass kick’em in the other knee. Hahaha Anna says I remember some cheerleaders used to wear those back in the day. Reebok high-top classics tricked out with some Velcro. Nice. Trekking up the ‘easiest’ side of the mountain we go. A graded stretch with many long switchbacks but hey up is up no matter how you slice it. 4 miles to the monument guys. The pace was a pretty good click as I felt strong this morning. Fresh and free. The kids pushing me all the way. I look over my shoulder and no Harry, no Jeff and Bonnie. Yikes we better hold up guys.Popping around the corner Harry appears ready to shed every layer he has on. Pants zipped off, both jackets peeled off. How’s them shoes doing, CLASSIC? Jeff staggers up a hot mess. Bandana soaked, barely a word came out for catching his wind, except…Yoo Maatha thought you said this wont steep? You LIIIIED to me. Then he went silent. Bonnie edges up behind him as if to say we made it. She’s moving some slow too with a hip pointer problem. Her foot has a pain that has caused her to compensate and now created quite a pain up in her leg. Woo boy we might need Life Team 10 for these 2. With a little encouragement that this IS the easier side to ascend we move on.Closer and closer to the top the wind really gusts now and again. Feels good to keep us from getting too hot but does cause quite the chill in the shade of the holler. Wonderful shadows roll across the mountain’s landscaping adding contrast of oranges, greens, and yellows to the fall foliage. I love this time of year. I think we’ve made the top kiddos this is the forest road. The monument and lunch are not too far now. Anna is already excited about her lunch, garlic hummus and milk duds. A true veggie’s delight. We hear a plane above but can’t see for the high clouds. That sound happened last time we hiked here. Guess the ghost of Audie is doing a fly by for us. It sure ain’t Harry cause he is down here. Haa HaaIt didn’t take us long to find a seat on the 2 benches at his resting place. The American and Texas flags fly in the breeze tattered from sun and weather. I guess the local VFW will replace in time. Harry approaches and calls out to halt ‘you couldn’t have started lunch without me’. Heck I’m halfway into my samich man. He digs in his pack for some year old nabs and a coke that he stashed in there this morning. When the word got out that our bench had milk duds and pop tarts he was ready to change teams. I pulled out some left over Halloween candy as well. Man we all wished we had some Noni about now. She’d baked some sort of goodness for us all. Where are you Noni??While lunch was finishing we explored the monument and its past discussing the stories we’d heard about Audie’s demise in a plane crash due to fog and old age instrumentation. I thought it only fitting we honor 2 more Gold Star soldiers at this sight. See my video again on facebook.In addition we found another memorial just over the hill at an overlook with a bench. The site was for Matt Payne, A Rocket City Rambler said the plaque. His boots were left on a rock ledge here. I’m guessing he was a local boy. Just before we left the monument a section hiker arrived and I introduced myself and asked if I could snap a photo of him with the granite structure. Low Hiker, from PA, here to complete the last of VA. He did 11 miles today and will do about the same tomorrow coming off at Sinking Creek. His wife is meeting him at Craigs Creek this eve and they will hike into Niday shelter for the night. She is his shuttle and slack pack team. We both agreed it was nice chatting with one of our own. Sometimes we get that slight look from thru-hikers that we aren’t quite up to their standard since we aren’t doing the entire trip in a year. No worries our adventure keeps on going man. Good luck.Back to the fire road we go. I think to myself this will give Bonnie a chance to see if her leg will let her complete the hike. I had already told them of a car access spot at the top of the mountain. You can see the forestry gate just up the way from the other bench before the AT turns off the crest and heads down to the valley. Nope I shall make it she says I’m good. Harry and Jeff both gave a puppy dog look of man what about us, we want the car shuttle. Too late boys you heard the women Let’s HIKE.3.6 more to go. This is all down right Martha? Ah yes my friends. Get those sticks in hand and brace those knees for some punishment. Down and around and down and around the trail takes us. West winds turn to calmer fall breezes as the elevation lessens. Everyone is moving along nicely too. The front pack only makes 2 stops for regrouping. Yo Maatha it’s getting on close to 2 o’clock. You said we’d be finished by 2. I’m stopping at 2. Keep on hiking Jeff I’ll get you there by 2.Reaching the bottom lands we notice the creeks are still dry. There are 6 footbridges in place with nothing flowing under them. Maybe one spot with a trickle. We need snow this winter for sure. It’s hard to believe with all the spring and summer rains the area is still dry. Let’s pull a trick on the Cardiac Kid. I holler back knowing we are close to the main road “I’ve made a miscalculation we have 3 more miles to go!” Harry drops his jaw and this sticks. Jeff turns into a pumpkin right on the spot … Bonnie just keeps on hiking. Looking at my watch it’s 6 minutes till 2. Come on kids we got this.Stepping out from the woods we cross the road to our car. Low Hiker and his wife are loading up for their hike into the shelter. Enjoy. Bonnie comes in with a limp but has made it. One tough women she is. Jeff and Harry are still chatting about who knows what. All I know is they made it too and without injury or rescue. What a great hike.Happy Trails to all and to all a good flight….","Audie Murphy -Trout Creek Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/438804,"There was no rest for the weary Sunday. I had hikers coming I can’t just not go. The Straggler has come from far and wide. Tried his best to hit his drop zone at the Blacksburg airport just the day before to watch the football game but the fog would not part to let him in. The kids are waiting anxiously to see some new trail, Anna anyway. And low and behold the L-Train has come from his sleep station to walk about. Yes I tell you I was not much in the way of a good Lead Dog. Half sick and not able to keep much down or in this morning I put on my pack and head out.
There were big plans for the day. Two overlooks, a tribute and options for more distance to hike. Well 2 out of 3 ain’t bad. How far are we going? Is it all up hill? What will we see from the overlooks? Anna is a barrel of questions this morning. Larry quickly interjects that this WILL be a short hike; all up hill and best to keep a safe distance from Martha or you might get spew on your shoes. Humm there seems to be a theme to this location since Skyla did that very thing last Thanksgiving break. We tackled Pearis mtn with a little snow on and cold temps pushing our way to the top. She was exhausted in a short distance from the start and ready to hurl. Hold it together Lead dog.
Chattering behind us was the conversation connection, Harry and Larry. What a twosome. I don’t think a climb to Mt. Everest could keep these guys from talking up a storm. Drifting back farther and farther till Larry’s voice is just barely heard. Gives me a good reason to take a break for some Gatorade. I’ve packed in my McDonalds muffin for later when I think it will settle with me. Glad the temps are unseasonable warm. A little breeze even to dry the sweat from my brow. 
Switchbacks turn to steeper climbing now. Sure hope the rains hold off today and that we can see out once up here. Tj has already been telling Anna of what to expect up ahead. His memory is spot on. The first overlook is just around that next turn and boy am I ready to set down at the rest.
Peering off the rock ledge looking down to the New River and Pearisburg was quite the treat. Heavy clouds hang to the far ridge line of Peters Mountain. I point out where the trail follows over the bridge coming out past Celanese then cuts up towards the Rice Fields. Hey we’ve hiked that they say, cool. 
Waiting for the fellows to arrive we decide to do another tribute to 2 more Gold Star soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Placing their flag on top of Angels Rest giving them a silent tribute gave purpose to the day. A resting place for soles to visit. 
Onward my friends lets track down the rest of my pack. Again Lead dog isn’t doing a great job with her group. We heard them boys clammering below us from the rock but now no more. They must have gone on to the next over look, Wilburn Valley. Nothing to fear “we’ll catch them” TJ declares. 
Winds and whaling from ahead. Boys boasting of their accomplishment of beating us to the top. Something about taking a shortcut. Trust me if there was one I’m sure they would have taken it.
Larry sets far away from the ledge. Quickly coaxing TJ from the edge where he stands majestically taking in the valley wide. Harry’s already go on like 5 layers of clothes, zipping back on his pant legs. Winds gust over chilling us down. Rains a coming before this day is out.
Taking a short snack break is all we could stand. Anna’s pizza cheese was blowing off so we gotta go. So Lead Dog are we gonna walk on or Off? Larry again is quick to answer for me…Hell no we ain’t walking on. There’s nothing out there but a down that we gotta come right back up and a place to turn around at. From here IT IS ALL DOWN, follow ME. And there you have it folks, how Lead Dog lost her pack and her lead. 
Well Larry didn’t really take the lead but he did get this train going out. I took my point position and let the kids push me right off this mountain leaving the talking heads to solve the rest of this world’s problems. I’m thinking they might need Captain for that.","Rt. 634

Humm sounds like Bland, sounds like a ‘dismal’ falls kind of day. Hey I’m all happy about it. I’m dress in winter gear. Long johns topped off with my “Baum Proof” wool hat. Larry wake up there’s hiking to be done. Harry ain’t comin but that doesn’t give you a pass buddy. Anna’s dragging butt even with TJ’s prodding. They are late but I’ll wait I wanna HIKE. Been a dang month and I’m about in D.Ts. I’ve kept it short today and us off the ridges. Wiiinndy! Since my hiking partners don’t have quite the spunk I’m feeling I will even shorten our planned 7 miles to just 5. Yep Merry Christmas you sorry sacks! This will be the kid’s first trip to the falls and they are excited. I begin to tell them how the trail used to have a path off this side-hill down to Trents Store. Now the hikers have a little of a road walk to reach. Good country store with some fine mom and pop grilled foods and of course you can check your game if you kill a deer.Larry’s already groaning about the terrain. He’s been here but not remembering this first little pull to get up and over the hill and down to the falls. It’s only 2.3 miles honey suck it up, you’ll make it. TJ has taken the roll of walking with him and I’m sure getting his ear bent slap off. Harry where are you?Anna and I are pushing for the turn. She’s ready to have a set down. Too much rock’n and roll’n last night at the local hang out. She’s pulled a Buck Nelson. Don’t worry Jim I’ll have them in shape for NY. The sound of the falls is heard as we round the final corner. Rhodies surround us, love those tunnels. The sign has a welcome greeting from hikers making notes to others of what an awesome place this is for camping, swimming and fun. Waaaaahoooo! I’ve always wanted to camp here myself in the summer so maybe will this coming.Ice has formed in a few spots where the water falls over the ledges down to that great swimming hole. It’s a long way from totally frozen but in time this winter I’m sure it will be. A tree just off from the ledge we elect to hold up at makes a perfect spot to plant my tribute flag for 2 more soldiers we plan to honor today. Larry notices a road just across the creek and wonders where that came from and why the heck we didn’t start there. Well that wouldn’t have been a hike my dear. That would have been a drive by. The boys explore some more and I talk to Anna about some camping options. We take our group photo and decide to have a snack back up by the sign; it will be warmer there instead of beside these cold waters. It didn’t take long at all to hike back out. Guess knowing we’d be eating our lunch at the car helped. We’ll be back there by noon and home in time for a nap…can you say L-Train time?A Merry Christmas to all.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440422,"It's been 10 years since I've done trail work. That was in 2002. I was going thru divorce and trying to find my new place in life. I chose a week long stint with people I had never met. We would be working and camping someplace along the Appalachian Trail. A place I had strongly thought about dropping everything I had at the time to go walk. That week was the hardest work I had ever done in my life. Sweat and tears I left in Hot Springs NC. That week rejuvenanted my soul. My heart was now with the trail. Today we work in Pearisburg relocating a section of trail running across the Celanese Plant's property leading to the Rice Fields. My group is hooking up with the Outdoor Club of VT (OCVT) and a few from the Roanoke's Club, RATC. Captain, Harry, Dustin, Jim and myself make up the Lead Dog pack. While Nimal, Jerry and Hunter represent the OCVT. Ralph Robertson hiked in also representing his own trail, Mill Creek of Narrows. Finally I'm most excited to meet the Witchers from Roanoke, Homer and Teresa. The Walking Witchers they were called back in 2002 when they took their family out to walk 2180 miles of the AT. My dad and I followed them thru the Roanoke Times paper. Their daughter age 11, Taylor (Cascade) and son Bennette (8) made the journey. Cascade some years later attempted her own trip and I followed her on Trail Journals. Needless to say I was very excited to chat with the Witchers about their trip and where the kids are today. (Bennette is in college at VT and Cascade married atop McAfee Knob. Nope not to Pogo if you recall her journals but to another. Homer assured me of that.)Loading up we head for a forest road where gates will be unlocked to let us drive the fireroad within about a mile from our work today. Some of the trail has already been lain just awaiting white blazes. Captain has been out here once already to do his tutorial in trail maintenance and be a leader if we chose to come back 'unsupervised'. A pile of work tools are stashed in the woods covered with a big brown tarp. Man if they had a worker for every tool here we'd have this thing knocked out in a week. Jerry the OCVT leader and Nimal tell us the ATC plans to have this section done by spring. I'm not sure how many miles we are talking about but at least 5 from where we park when hiking to the Rice Fields and then there's the section from the New River bridge to that point. I think that is 2ish. This new trail will take an easier route to the fields but will still have one sharp pull after a long switchback coming up right behind the back of the shelter and privy. Jim and I did scout this out close to the end of our work day. Jim and Captain uncover the tarp. Hey Martha get your catchers mit, I've got the shin guards! Jim hollars out. Hard hats on, shin guards, safetly glasses and gloves. Grab a pulaski/mattock and get to digging. Follow those red flags, that's the new path. Nimal and Captain give us instruction how to take the top layer of soil off the ground, making a 45 degree angle so water will drain off properly. Well once the soil was off it was all hard work from there. Rock, rock, rock. My mattock just bounced off the ground with each blow. Ok I'm tired! Where's that fire rake? That looks easier. 2180 MILES are you kidding me? All layed by hand. Hard back breaking work by thousands of volunteers. Hours of work. WOW. Now THAT's the true accomplishment here. I said it more that once today and will say it again I'm sure....I'd rather be hiking this trail than making/maintaining it. We worked from 10 to 3ish with a break for lunch. Jerry said it best when he left us to go on up to his work detail (cutting dead trees around the shelter)....Go make the trail, rest, have fun and enjoy this fine day. And that we truely did. Homer and Teresa worked diligently on a tall stump left right in the middle of the trail. Not sure why a new trail would even have such a thing. You are starting from scratch right? Why not go around? Anyways here it was, and had to be removed. Crowbar leverage and enginuity got it done. Mean while the Lead dog gang inched up the trail making good progress towards a slight stream of a water source. In my mind this would be our goal for the day. Just get the trail to there and that should be a good days work. I found if I stayed between the boys just behind Hunter letting him cut the trail I could manage some productivity without killing myself. Let that young strapping college boy do the hardest of the work and I'll clean up the area he leaves behind. It worked! This chain gang was a fine tuned machine by mid afternoon. Say Dustin where's the beverage cart? I'm thirsty. Warm sun and work kept us comfortable most of the day. It was quite chilling early this morning.Making it to the water source finally put us all working here together. Teresa and Homer cut a ditch and cleared rocks for the water to flow in a line across the trail. Large rocks placed to step across but not to far to cause a long strid. Team work got this little spot hiker ready in a flash. Now what? Time to move that big pile of tools up to this point so the next workers will be ready to start where we have left off. Our work is done here.Walking out one last bit of trail maintenance advice...Walk on the high side Homer instructs us. High side? Yes walk next to the high side of the trail. It packs it down and keeps the next hiker from walking close to the edge which moves the trail. And that we did. We walked on the high side. That's what trail work is really, a sense of high accomplishment, a sense of making something that others will walk for years to come. Yes we walked on the high side of life.P.S. SKETTI anyone? Yes the Captain has come thru once again for the annual sketti hike. And what better time for some food than after a hard days work. It didn't take much to twist the arms of Nimal and Hunter to come join us. My only advice was you better cut in front of Harry if you want any sauce boys...I'll let the pictures tell this story....","New Trail to the Rice Fields

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440749,"Fog engulfs the highway, my car. Don’t miss the exit to Groseclose. Hope the kids can see the big red barn our meeting spot. I text to make sure. What is this coming? The Straggler HA, didn’t know he was coming, cool. Hold off rain, wind or whatever that’s supposed to happen today we got some hiking to do.Really unsure of the weather I have on lightweight long johns and raingear in the pack. Rain is one thing but freezing rain well that’s another. I’ve chosen this low lying stretch with 2 options for shelter if the weather turns really nasty. 30s now so hey that’s a heat wave from the teens we’ve had recently. This IS going to be EASY right Lead dog? Sure it is. Heck Larry hiked this a few years back in 8 degree weather. If he can make it you guys can. Harry isn’t so sure this REALLY happened without some verification from the Higher Source but agrees to hike along just the same. Field grass is quite wet from the rain last night and fog settling in this morning. Our shoes will get wet fast so I told everyone to bring a warm change of socks for later. Harry not only put in socks he put in gortex booties…too bad one size doesn’t fit all because one was Betty’s size 7ish and one was his. Ooops that won’t work. Hey but he did pack a good lunch though. Hot soup with some Amish homemade cheese. Wanna trade?Over the hills and thru the woods to Lindamood School house we go. Established 1894 and tucked back just off the main highway you’d never know it was here if weren’t for the old Farmhouse and Settlement touring spot it is located with. We explore the school going inside it’s cold walls, windows shutters boarded up for the winter. Hikers have signed the register and I bet have slept in here before to get out of the weather. Summer time there is usually water for them and a supply box I’ve seen. From here we walk thru the old farm checking out the big white house and it’s side building. Aged farm equipment is displayed for old time sake. Making a loop we hook back up with the AT and have come 2.5 miles and guess what NO RAIN. Heck it’s warming up actually BUT look snow. Yep once in the woods now and under rhododendron cover snow remains from past dustings. Quite chilly in here too where no light can break in. 2 miles and we’ll be at the shelter. In and out of cold patches we start making the numerous creek crossings. 4 to be exact and a few more tricky than others. Watch out those rocks are slick. Humm a 2 log crossing bridge, I got this. Yikes a 1 log water crossing. Don’t like those. No room for error. Good we all make it across now to do so on the return.Say it’s that a road? Anna already has taken up Larry’s soap box to let me know there was a road back there at Lindamood we could have parked at and saved walking the first 2 ½ miles. Now this little road is within ½ mile of the shelter this sign says. Yes yes we COULD have driven to all those spots but what be the point in the hike? No pound cake for you!!!Cutting deeper in to the holler of the mountain I begin to wonder when the shelter will appear. I’s almost noon and I’m hungry. Anna’s starving as usual. This isn’t much of a climb but enough for us to have started to sweat and feel that breakfast has long burned off. I think I see it, first the privy, and yes the shelter is just there. Setting just up off the trail the shelter is a cold one. The PATC has painted the inside nice and white which gives it a better since of lighting. Not much sun can get in here for sure. Harry and I recall one time here a vagrant hiker was setting back in the shelter and all we could see was the whites of his eyes. A pretty sketchy and dirty fellow. Gave us the creeps. That’s the only time I’ve ever felt uneasy about another on the trail.We grab a set back inside the picnic table has ice on it and everything else is wet. TJ pulls out a new Christmas gift, a tiny fold up stool. A tiny stool for Tiny Pants. HA Anna you can fit on there..you’re hangin over the side girl. Shit it would have been swallowed up in the crack of my big ol arss so I’d even go there. LOLA hot soup lunch does the trick. A tribute to a gold star soldier was made with a few TV bloopers but I finally got it right and we are back off. Look blue skies. Yea man glad I didn’t stay on the couch today. Ahh feel that warm breeze? Is it possible with snow under foot still? Yes it is, must have been the spirit of Sgt Brandon Islip. He is thanking us for honoring his service. Water crossing past us and shortly we are already back to the farm. I’m hot!! Suns out some more now and all winter outerwear is off. I’m ready to get out of these long johns but with muddy pant legs just decide to zip them off. Harry’s in his cooling cotton, Cotton is King!!!We are already thinking of grubbing at the Big Red Barn when we finish. County cooking to hamburgers yummm. But first I have another small tribute to a little gal neighbor of mine. Miss Olivia, see I have my survival bracelet on you made me. It is in honor of her Aunt who is fighting breast cancer. Olivia is selling homemade bracelets to help her aunt with bills or whatever she might have. Thank you Olivia it has brightened our journey.Crossing back thru the fields we can see what all was fogged out earlier. The interstate, the houses, the factory. I kinda liked it better fogged out. The big red barn awaits but no you say, it is closed. We missed feeding time. They must close up after Sunday lunch. Guess we’ll have to quarter up Larry’s pound cake.","Groseclose

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441015,"Hold on to your hat folks. Dang I thought today was supposed to be 50 degrees. Ain’t nowhere close at the moment. The mud ruts are frozen solid at the Three Way parking spot above Woods Hole Hostel. All cold weather gear goes on and off we go for our hike to an overlook off top of Sugar Run Mountain. I don’t expect to see a sole out here today but little did I know…..So how hard is the hike they ask? How far? As the wind cuts across us, Harry’s eyes the only thing uncovered on his head. Even Anna and TJ have hoods over their mountain boomer rabbit hats. I mean it’s cold but it ain’t that cold. However in the back of my mind I am dang glad I put in my down jacket for our lunch stop. I have my rain jacket on now as a wind break. Works great. We have mostly ridge walk or just shy of ridge line walking anyway. One or two small climbs so yes this will be an easy hike considering most. Not much scenic about it either but just to sunny to be inside for sure and we do hope the wind will lay for a pleasant day. Hey guys this is spot John got his trail name…cracked his head good on a down tree across the trail. Johnny Knobknocker where are you today? I also tell them about the Ribble Trail that cuts straight up this mountain that used to be the AT. I plan to bring ya’ll back and we’ll walk that for a nice loop of this section. And of course a trip up here wouldn’t be without a stop in at Woods Hole hostel. Yes it’s been here since Earl Schaffer hiked the AT, the first documented Thru-Hiker in 1948. Miss Tilly Woods was the owner at that time but now her granddaughter Neville and husband Michael run this place. A little piece of heaven carved out in the back woods of Sugar Run Mountain. We spotted some of their farm animals on the drive in. Hippy cows were the topic of conversation. Long haired cows, what is that? And horns to boot. Short legged little guys grazing in the morning light. Scottish Highlanders is their real name Neville told us. Goats, beehives, chickens, cats, ginnies and a puppy dog in a pear tree.Is that a road Anna spies? Yep Harry confirms. Yes yes we could have parked here and there will yet another up the way we could have too. Haven’t you learned not to even ask such of me? It ain’t gonna happen folks. Listen to Harry he knows the drill…”you know you’re not lost with Martha if you’re going up hill.” Now we didn’t have so much of that today and once on the fire road just below the ridge we warmed nicely to come out of hats and gloves. In no time we reached the rhododendron patches and I know we are at the overlook. Mountain range to our left heading to Docs Knob and Angels Rest I pointed out. Pearisburg to the valley with high puffy clouds casting shows on the landscape. Magic from the skies. Let’s eat in the cover of the woods and we’ll come back out here for some photos before we leave. Sun, cliff bars, pickled eggs and potato chips pass around. Now that’s hiking. Everything tastes good and feels good on the trail. Stories of events we’ve been to and experienced current and past. Lunch was more than nourishment it was camaraderie. Ok troops lets bust fire on this trail back I’ve got some football to watch. Ahh the winds have subsided. Good thing for Harry, he flew over from Bluefield this morning and it a shaky landing to say the least. Tail winds pushing him crossway down the run way. Knocking him around along with all his stuff inside the plane. Glad I was the shuttle service instead of a passenger for sure. Look here comes some hikers and man are they moving fast. Definitely not day hikers. Long blonde locks of flowing hair on a thin tall guy marching towards me on a mission. To his rear comes a high stepping gal with pippy long stockings on, in shorts and a heart smiley faced designed shirt. Now I wasn’t about to let these folks fly by without a chat. Wow and a chat we got.. Chatty Cathy aka 2 Liter ran her conversation like no bodies business telling us of people, places and trail mishaps that would bring you to tears laughing. All along while Fabio stood smiling with his big pack on. They had started out in July from Maine 3 days apart not hiking with one another. She started with a 25 lb pack. They met in NY and began hiking together in PA, now loaded with 60 lbs him and 50 her. Now today was a slack packing day and let me tell ya she was some kind of happy to be carrying her Tommy Truck tiny kiddies pack from Wal-Mart with only food supplies and paying Bubba from Bland to shuttle her pack from Woods Hole to Bland. The best $45 dollars she ever spent she says. Fabio carried some day supplies and their tent for camping possibly at Dismal Falls. Tenting was another whole story in itself according the our little chatter box. Frozen shoes to wet down bags due to condensation. Then there was an attack by a skunk and the stories just rolled on…..We said good luck to our 2 last SOBOs for 2013. According to them 2 others behind them dropped out so they appear to be the last heading to GA with an eta of March 2. Good luck my friends and maybe we’ll do a day hike in the next weeks to catch up with you guys for some more trail side stories. So our day was complete now. We have hiked a new section for the kiddos and met some possibly historical folks along our way.","Three Way

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441407,"How cold can it be? Can't be that cold with this many people gathered for work outside. Trucks and cars just keep rolling in to the park in ride in Pearisburg. Every engine stays running to keep the warm air blowing for as long as we can. Once we step out there will be no turning back. Robin Reed the weatherman gives us a number the high will be today and it's not even a double digit. I know I left the house with my warmest gear on I own.Captain has agreed to drive us up to where we walk in for the relocation work. The hike in is about 2 miles. All fresh built trail. We'll begin work where we left off so we think. I step out of the truck into the icebox holler. I strategically put my gloves in my coat pockets so they would be good and warm instead of leaving in my pack which rode up in the truck bed. Jim has driven in again from Raleigh eager to share in the reward of giving back to the trail. His lungs are trying to adjust to this fridged mountain air. He says he almost stopped breathing. Harry is bundled to the max. No cotton today. All layers of wool and fleece. I'd say he weighs a few pounds more carrying all his stuff.Our trail leader Jerry gave us some instruction prior to our hike in. #1 have fun. #2 stay warm. #3 the warmth is in the tools. One girl was ready to begin work right then, Give me a tool. She was froze. Cotton kills!!! That's all she had on. Wind was cutting right thru that VT sweatshirt and Harry double checked to make sure she had socks on. Jerry passed out boggens and extra jackets to those not prepared. I was afraid they might knock Captain in the head and steal his Western Mountaineer jacket.Jerry was right heat was in those tools. I didn't want to put my pick ax down all day. Man when I did stop it didn't take long to chill. Two other leaders, Kathryn and Joshua, from the Blacksburg ATC gave instruction too. They both have hiked the AT and now have turned it into a career. Bennett is here. Remember he was the son of the Witchers. He walked the trail with the family when he was 8 years old, trail name Rock Slide. He was even wearing his sister's, Cascades, old trail shoes. Jim was quick to point out a burned place on the picnic table at the shelter where we had lunch saying it must have been Cascades. She wasn't the best at working her alcohol stove and usually caught something on fire. He brought a big gang of Virginia Tech students with him. We had 3 groups split up to start work, about 17 of us total. I'm thinking we can get a bunch of new ground ready to walk. Harry, Jim, Captain and I jump right in like old veterans and put on our hard hats and shin guards. Grabbing my tool of choice I ready myself for the word go and look for some more red flags to lead my way....but wait...what?...we are going to work on this same section? Looks pretty good to me. Better than some trail I've walked...Like Maine...rocks rocks rocks and roots. You want me to pitch every rock out of the trail? Every root? This part isn't sloped. Miss Kathryn had a whole new idea of what was ready for hikers and what wasn't. So I about faced and headed down the path and began my relo redo. Big Bad Ralph had to reset his rock steps too. He had built a fine rock section to cross over a stream but it just didn't met code. I've seen his trails he has built all by his own hand. Talking about a strong man, wow, bigger than all outdoors and can tell a heck of a story. Harry named him Paul Bunion after he reached down to pick up a rock big as a 5 gallon wash tub. Wrapped it up in his arms like a baby while the other guys teamed up on rocks that size with a rope/strap system to lug them around. Bennett took his team down to shore up a banked rocky section while Joshua took a group just past where we started last time. Not sure what was getting worked on there but hey that's why he's the boss. A good built trail will be a long lasting trail. Bob Peoples would be proud.For lunch we walked up to the shelter, Rice Fields. Jerry had a fire or some what of one going. He had the REAL job. Drives right up to the shelter by way of the fireroad. Has a fire and his truck to start to warm up. He is his own master up here. Crawling up in the back of the shelter it feels like a day on the trail with hikers. The shelter is wall to wall people finding a place to set down for lunch. Our breath fills the air like smoke it's so cold. I can't wait to open my hot soup and cider. I feel the eyes upon me. Hope they don't knock me in the head and take my thermos. Ah not to worry I have cups for sharing. Again breaks bring out the cold and we don't set around very long. Where's my tool?Rocks are broken and busted for scree, trail is leveled, and backs are breaking armoring. It's a super highway baby. Bring on the white paint and blaze this mother.","Pearisburg

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442190,"As the song goes...UT OH it's magic! Who doesn't like magic? It can be at the hand of a magician, the hand of our creator or maybe just you and me. I love me some magic and being on the giving end of trail magic, man now that's where it's at!!Our first magic of the day was good ol Harry landing that Mooney on a snow covered runway. We are picking him up at the Mountain Empire Airport in Rural Retreat. Didn't he see the weather forecast for down here? Snow and wind and yes it came. By the time I parked the car it had the ground covered and I expect we'll be walking in it all day. He battens down the hatch and scurries to the car as the wind turns him sideways. We both are layered up again today just like yesterday. Heck I have all the same clothes on except for fresh underoos. Excited we are. Excited to be setting up some trail magic for our SOBOs Fabio and 2 Liter we met just a week ago. She has kept me informed of their wear abouts since and are hiking out from Groseclose this morning after a big breakfast from The Barn. Yummm I can taste one of their cathead biscuits now. We plan to meet them at US86, a forest road the trail crosses, for lunch. They will have had a good hour or so head start on us and should be there by 1:00 I hope. We pull into park off Rt. 16 and will put a goody bag at Partnership shelter that is just a minutes walking distance. TJ sees the rangers station and says is that the shelter? Man that's something else. Well no but wait till you do see Partnership it's one of the best on the trail. A 16 sleeper with an upstairs loft totally closed in from the weather and a window you can shutter close. It has a spicket for water and a shower in the summer time. Best part is there's a pay phone at the rangers station outside you can call pizza delivery from. Now that's the bomb. It will be hard to top that but I'm gonna try with my bag of magic. TJ and I place it upstairs by the steps so they can see it and will be out of site in case others show up and take it for their own. It's labeled for our 2 friends and has a note wishing them well. Enclosed we have 2 Dr Peppers, orange juice, fruity yogurt, baby fresh yellow peppers, nabs, chocolate donuts and a VA completion celebration pack. This includes 2 mini whiskeys and M&Ms for toasting at the VA/TN line. I have packed hot cider in the thermos to give them at our lunch stop later. Magic baby Magic.Snow is under foot and a bit is in the air. Temps not supposed to get more than 20s today. Anna didn't check her forecast just right and was quite aw stricken when I informed her 40 was not in the picture. TJ was a tad out of focus too. He has worn his light weight tennies and has already gone into meditation mode knowing his feet will be wet. At least the wind isn't howling.Up and over the ridge line the trail keeps us in view off both sides. Snow dusts the sides of the trees like frosting. It is a great day for a hike. I hope our friends are making it ok with those big packs hiking in this snow. Slippery. Pud after pud we close in on the big one, Locust Mountain. This will be our bitch for the day. A straight up climb to a peak and then drops right back down to the road where we plan to rendezvous.. I've told you 2 Liter is quite to talker. We plan nothing shall be any different today and that we should rally together to get a word in. If we all put our thoughts together and string them along we might have a chance. I begin to think....2 LITER WHERE ARE YOU? Harry shouts out again. We've just crested the bitch. What goes down must come up. Damn we gotta come back over this. Harry hollers out again. Please answer back I don't wanna go down. But that we do and the road is there. We find some sawed off tree stump set around a firepit. Man I wish I'd been thinking I could have built a fire while we wait. Oh well hot cider will have to do. It 12:40, they should be along soon. We eat and chat, check the map and then begin to get cold. Feet are loosing that warmth from movement and the toes begin to get chilled. The kiddos are really getting cold so we have to move on. We tap into the cider to get that good feeling again and leave a little bag of magic between the rocks at the road on sticks to keep it off the snowy ground. Trail bars, peanut butter crackers, and beef and cheese sticks. That's all I had in my pack. Oh I wish they could have gotten some hot cider. My magic hat has lost it's rabbit.Trudging back over Locust Mtn I send up a little prayer for safety to come to our friends and that they find our treats. I was going to tell them where to find their goody bag back at the shelter but now I will just leave a note on the table when we get back. And getting back was much quicker than I thought. It did seem later in the day though with the dark skies holding the next weather event in their clouds. The sound of the road is heard. Look some sunglasses on a tree. Anna spied them on the way out and has noticed them again now. Hey how do they look on me? Think I will wear them back to the shelter and leave for Fabio. He'd look nice in these. Walking up to the shelter in my shades, beer in hand and a note to leave with it the place is full. 7 guys are sectioning and are here for the night. They have been out 4 days and will come off at Lindamood tomorrow. We tell them of our attempt to hook up with our friends and they say they noticed our care package left upstairs. They had gone through it and saw the date and new it was just left. Good they didn't eat it. Now you guys don't fight over this one beer I'm leaving. It would go good with that pizza your going to order but it's magic for later. They laugh and will welcome them in when they arrive.Our day is complete our magic has been sprinkled all along this stretch of trail. And look blue skies. Clouds have departed and opened the heavens to shine down on Partnership. One shelter of many that bring friends together, UT OH its magic.....PS...Fabio and 2 Liter found out roadside treats and loved our shelter magic. They texted a thank you written in the snow. We shall try to catch them again next weekend. Stay tuned.","Partnership Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441642,"“Mayday Mayday, Lead Dog we need a ride out!!! It’s cold, we’re freezing and we’ve been busting through a foot of snow all day.” My phone rings at 7:00pm Saturday night with a voice of despair. 2 Liter isn’t her bubbly self, more calm in her speech and tries to reason if tomorrow is the day they come off the trail and possibly flip flop to Georgia to finish their journey. L-Train load up your pack ol boy I need a hiking buddy. My original plan of running trail magic out to The Scales at Mt Rogers area was a bust as my other hikers couldn’t make it. But hey I made a promise to some SOBOs I plan to keep. Magic it will be some place. So the secondary plan was to sweet talk Larry into joining me for a shorter walk to Wise Shelter from Massie Gap. We’d get a starter fire going for our friends hiking this way and leave some goodies for them in the shelter. Wow did plans change.Saturday night when 2 Liter called to say they were only at Hurricane Mountain shelter I knew now was the time for them to get out. Bad weather on the ground in snow and artic cold coming. I told her of Rt. 603, Fox Creek, that would be only a 3 miles hike out from where they are now. Only 3 miles sounds short but they had hiked 9 miles the day before and took them all day arriving at Hurricane in the dark. White blazes don’t show up real well on snow covered trees. Danger Danger Red Robin!!!! Fabio is reads over his map while 2 Liter talks to me and we all agree Fox Creek will be our Rescue point. Come on L-Train let’s hike in a little ways to meet them. Now that our strategy hd turned from Magic to Rescue his thinking is this merely is a pickup/shuttle. NO WAY JOSE. It’s a sunny day, snows on the ground, let’s walk in and meet them. Rolling his eyes he puts on his pack and a smirk. Me I have my gators and my yak-traks. Let’s HIKE. Snow covers every branch and hangs heavy on the limbs. Fox Creek glistens with fresh ice and the smell of winter engulfs us. I’ve packed 2 red Gatorades for my friends and have some other goodies in the car for later when we take them to town. I left me pre-packed lunch in the car too. I shouldn’t be out that long. Water I do have.Why is it every time I hike with you we seem always to start UP? Who said that? Must be my conscience. Surly that wasn’t Larry talking. The trail turns up along a rhododendron path after crossing the creek. The 7 inches of snow makes footing slippery and hard to make a normal stride. Stair climbing we crest at a little opening and the sunlight can hit us. I’m warm so I shed a layer and take a drink of water. Larry comes up and I can tell I won’t have him long in my presences. This looks like a good place to make a tribute video for my hiker friend Robin who is doing an honorary hike for every fallen soldier killed in Afghanistan who is from Virginia. Today she hikes her 100th tribute. At a girl, I post an American Flag in a tree and let the wind fly its stars and stripes. Larry and I walk a little ways on together before the L-Train is called back to his station. I figure my hikers will be coming along in the next 30 minutes. I’ve been out about an hour and a half. We left the parking lot at 10:45 and they should have left their camp at about the same time. I know I’m not moving 2 miles an hour and know they aren’t either. Resting a bit for a water break, I didn’t bring my platypus for fear of the tube freezing and such a short walk in. Looking up to the skies it is a perfect bluebird kind of day. It would be a hard decision for me to come off the trail and go to another state to restart my journey. It has to be hard for these guys especially since they have put so many months into it already. (Hiking since July1st)A glimpse of a grey coat moves up the trail. I see 2 Liter, her heart smiley faced shirt catches my eye. I whistle out. Here guys I have Gatorade. They chug them down. What’s this you have here on the side of the trail…A snowman? Yep and he has a little tree beside him decorated with ornaments. Big smiles come to their faces. Its 2 Liters first snowman ever made. Heck she just saw snow for the first time on this very journey. Giggles and some sadness as she tells me all about how hard the decision was to end their VA hiking today. This little bit of fun has helped lighten their load in more ways than one. What seemed like a half a day to hike into see them has turned in just minutes coming back out. Having already broken the snowy depths the trek is much easier now. Not to mention all the trail talk going on. I got lost in the moment forgetting who I was. I was in a thru hikers story passing from state to state making my way to a summit. It was magic.And it was magic, or was it fate or God’s intervention that brought us together. I’ll take any and all. “We must admit one of the best parts of Virginia next to the fields has been you Lead dog” Now that’s more than magic…We delivered our friends to their hotel in Marion VA where they will regroup and head for Springer GA in the morning. I shall see you at Mt Rogers Fabio and 2 Liter when you summit with the ponies and those grassy fields of Virginia…..","Fox Creek

It’s Super Bowl Saturday Baby!!! Jim and I plan to tackle the gorge and capture the castle. Road Closed! Parkway signs warn of the gates dropped so cars can’t enter. With the snow and ice from the past weeks treacherous passage is blocked off. Lucky for us the Rock Knob Campground parking spot is just prior to this so we are trail free. Putting on our gear we see 2 fellows hiking up out of the gorge by us in the adjacent field. They got an early start its 9am.Jim is quick to select our hiking direction today. We ain’t going down that gorge that’s for sure. Walking up thru the first field will get our blood pumping and legs limbered. Glad the winds are not hollowing like normal. Just a bright blue day with snow remnants dotting the landscape. Before we know it we have reached the Rocky Knob shelter. Our 2 guys are here taking a break and enjoying this historical old AT original. They are from Martinsville out for a training hike and have parked in the gorge. They plan to retrace their steps back down. Good luck men. I was sort of disappointed losing them for the challenge of hiking them down or keeping in front of them for the rest of the day. Buddy leads our way for a little ways but is so excited he has to stop every third rock or twig to mark his territory. This could take all day Jim. Buddy Coonhound step aside and let Lead Dog show you how to make some tracks. LOL Passing over the various parkway overlooks we can see for miles. Buffalo Mountain, an old landmark from our youth, Jim and I both remember our folks talking about taking truck rides up there as do we. Then comes the music festival grounds, Floydfest. No music today just that of our winter birds. I sure would like to stealth camp here in the edge of the woods and take in this festival but hear the park rangers have it pretty well scoped out for people like me. Into the woods we finally go, a nearby stream is running full, warm sun and cool drink of water for us all. We plan to have lunch at the old chimney which will be just past Rock Castle. Hiking this direction it doesn’t take long to ascend around the edges of the mountain, a much easier approach to this loop. Our kicker won’t come till we hit that last 3 miles out of the gorge. Holy hell, coming down it. Glad we aren’t. It’s slick enough with the leaves and will make you stand on your head at times. We’ll have the joy of stepping up and up and up to get back to our cars instead.Half way – Rock Castle – huge granite rock piled high for a massive effective. Our path cuts through the middle of the mountain making a way up and around the boulders. A snaky place in the summer for sure. A Rock climber’s heaven and a hikers joy to see. It was hard to capture it all in just one photo, we look like specks swallowed by the structure. An appealing bench makes us a perfect lunch stop. It’s just above the chimney and the dark looking north side of the mountain. Snow still covers that slope, looks cold. Here we are in the sun and have room for buddy to roam between us begging for food. Speaking of food…There’s always something new Jimbo is trying out. If it isn’t his one of a kind self-made Baum Proof Gear it’s his kitchen delights. Today we have power charged brownies. A chocolate snack packed with energy powder, oats and goodness. Not bad and I don’t really crave brownies. These will be snatched up for sure on a long hike from our fellow hiking friends. Still a half a loop ahead of us we moved into the darkness of the northside trail. Yak traks go on, snow and ice over here. The bridge over our first water crossing is spectacular. Snow several inches deep and ice formations around every rock and creeks edge. Down down the fire road we go. No slipping for us we have traks. Foot prints are coming and going but we don’t see anyone till almost at the bottom. Most folks park at the foot of the gorge and take the leisurely walk into the Boy Scout camping area and on up to the farmhouse. A water fall is about the only real highlight on this forest road decent. Frozen over and it makes for some tricky crossing. Actually a couple of places give us pause. Rock hops and quick stepping so not to break thru the ice. Don’t wanna get wet feet just yet. Finally we run into some hikers, couples and a gal looking for a friends lost dog, Luke. We offer our services and take a phone number for incase. Buddy even begins his yodel for the cause. LUUUKKKE, LUUKKKE. Reaching the end of our ‘pleasant’ hike it’s time to get down to some real hiking. The 3 miles I told you about has arrived. A sign marks our turn off the flat wide fire road. A plane flies above, wonder if that’s Harry making fun? We reminisce of our last time here when Bonnie and Harry proclaimed I was crazy and they were crazy for following me. Why would anyone in their right mind come back? Well we don’t see them here today do we? Where’s your sense of adventure, toughness, grit??? Let me tell ya, you better have all those and will power. Because your legs and lungs are gonna burn and that’s all that can get you out of here. The heat wells up in my face. I gotta cool off. Water, water. I zip off my pants to shorts and push up my sleeves. Getting my game face on it’s time to beat this gorge. Buddy pulls Jim up, mush mush!!! LUUUKKKEEE, LUUUUKKKKE.. Not now BuddyCoonhound we can’t spare any breath on Luke. It’s every man for himself now. Each rounding of the bend turns up steeper. A few grunts and heaves to get myself up and over high steps, rocks and roots. Are we Maine again? I do love this, this IS hiking!!Cresting at the little bench I know we have made it to the top. Only that little walk over a few foot bridges and we’ll be insight of the parkway road. I see the field now we have made it.A few cars are parked beside us. Some checking their gps for a work around since the barricade is still up. Tech students looking to joy ride and then a father son duo out for a day hike. Humm don’t think you’ll make it back around guys. Jim gives them some survivor tips, headlamp, extra samich and do you have a sleeping bag?? Father has been here but only on the fireroad to fish. Thought it would be fun to bring son, Campbell along for the loop. Well it’s 4:00 now, took us 6.5 hours to hike the 11 miles guys. You’ve only hike up the 3miles and you got 9 more to go and it gets dark at 6 or so. Campbell looks up at dad and says we can’t make it. Jim and I offer them a ride back down and it is graciously accepted. Buddy’s not much on sharing his truck set with strangers so I load up the family. Yes no other place I’d rather be on Super Bowl Saturday. I got to see it all. Highs and lows of the gorge, snow and ice, fun and sun. And a chocolate milk trade for a ride given to a father and son. Yes put that down as an annual event.","Rocky Knob Campgroud

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442080,"No doubt the falls will be frozen just wonder how passable the trail to it will be. Never fails with high foot traffic to this very scenic destination the path is a solid sheet of ice. A cold holler that doesn’t see much sunlight will lend to a cold hike under heavy cloud cover. But the trip up is well worth it and all the above proved to be true.Carolann and I traveled over to meet Bonnie this Sunday morning looking to get a nice hike in before we all settle in to watch the super bowl this afternoon. We hoped to beat the crowd and did with only a few cars here. Putting on our gloves and an extra layer we head out. Not more than just crossing the first bridge over Little Stony Creek do we decide yak traks will be needed.Hummm Bonnie says I didn’t bring those. Strike two…she had already forgot her sticks. Luckily I had Larry’s in the car and suited her up before we took off. Oh well guess I’ll just slip and slide today she musters. With my foot chains on I could have been gone in a flash but we better hang tight here beside out little friend to steady her over some of these next icy rock steps. Being the trooper she is Bonnie doesn’t let a little thing like ice stop her from her hike.Creek waters are frozen in interesting ice formations. We can’t stop taking pictures trying to capture their beauty. At almost every turn there is something new and creative to peer at. It is cold but not biting and we soon have to come out of one outer layer to keep from sweating. At the next junction we discuss it might be best for Bonnie to take the fireroad up the next mile and cut down to meet us just before we close in on the falls. Being close to water;s edge and very icy falling in is NOT an option we want to face. Bracing ourselves with our sticks and yaks Carolann and I proceed on the lower trail and Bonnie heads up above us on the road.At the .3 mile mark from our destination I look up and there she is, Bonnie has beat us to the falls. Kids are sliding from rock to rock with not a care in this world while their mom holds on for dear life. Tennie shoe traction hasn’t a chance on this snot like trail. There it is, The Cascades, frozen almost from top to bottom. I’ve seen it more iced over but this is pretty close. Its waters stacked up like a casing to block off its flow. The whole landing area is a solid platform to which inquisitive folks just have to walk out on. Us chilly chicks keep out distance and go to the rock landing area for our views and on over to another wall of icicles. Just fabulous creations of what nature can show us. Several ladies have come down the upper access to the falls and warn us of the treachery. Walking on flat ice is one thing but coming down it you just don’t have a chance. We decide since we’ll be going up we give it a go and once we hit the fire road should be smooth sailing or sliding!!!Again my yaks give the confidence and foothold to easily maneuver this little section. Bonnie grabs hold of the wooden railing, Carolann in front and me in the back for nothing more than moral support and a little push if she starts sliding backwards. Bonnie cat like reflexes take her without a fall to the top. We give her a big cheer.More folks are starting to hike in now. New xmas shoes are everywhere. Gonna get those muddy I tease. From ice to slick mud the upper trail is a mess. We kick off the yaks and look for leaves to walk in to keep from sinking. Feeling good to stretch my legs I put a little distance between my friends on the walk out. Hey Lead Dog you in a hurry Gabby hollers. What’s the rush Bon chimes in? Ah you know me girls Lead dogs gotta lead. But ya know they’re right…I slow and enjoy those last few steps hiking with the chilly chicks.","The Cascades

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442392,"What is old for one can be new for another but just as much fun for all. I just had to take the ducklings to new trail this weekend. I’ve been here many times over the years hiking from this exact point at Johns Creek or coming down to it from either north or south. Many memories here and looking forward to making some new ones. Just Anna and TJ with me today. This should make for a fast hike. I’ll push them and they’ll push me. Besides we wanna get in and out of the woods before a potential of rain sets in this afternoon. It’s a cool grey day but surprisingly calm. Just our excitement fills the air.I love big miles and this will be a good training run to prepare for our trip to NJ/NY. Starting out we have an easy warm up walk to the shelter of about a mile and then it’s switch backs up for a good 3ish miles to get those legs burning and lungs working. Crossing the few foot bridges they are old school fashion. Logs lain side by side for just a two wide foot hold. Easy does it guys no wet feet this early in the trip. Glad we don’t have ice on them. TJ has already wished for the white stuff to fall from the skies. I guessing we’ll have a little snow at Wind Rock…hopefully :o) Passing the shelter we drop a layer of clothing in our packs, remove the gloves and begin the climb. Thank you trail maintainers for rerouting this once brutal ascent of Salt Pond Mountain. Now long switchbacks with a moderate grade we can move fairly easily over the terrain. Pockets of cool air breaks thru the gaps in the mountain as we climb in elevation. Enjoy this while you can guys because once we reach the War Spur Connector Trail its back to old trail and it means business.Saluting another Gold Star soldier, Cpl Ryan McGhee, we leave our flag at the junction sign. Digging in we trudge up the deeply worn path of the old trail. Man I hope this gets easier over the next hikes I say to myself. I’m not even carrying my big pack and feeling a struggle going on with my body. I think I can, I think I can we chant moving closer to the crest. Ah snow dusts the ground now giving us a little lift in our step. Trail beauty gives the hiking sole fuel and makes all things easier. Still surprised the winds haven’t kicked up we are all smiles reaching the “lone pine” knob marking the top. More snow dusts the trees and branches with a light fog back drop. Humm we might not have a view out guys. Let’s just hike on and find out.Wandering along the trail we notice an iced over bog area, a perfect skating rink. Let the WINTER OLYMPICS BEGIN! Grab a seat at the Salt Pond Arena and see your favorite hikers perform. Spin and skid times 3 we twirl and pose for Mother Nature. I was very happy to capture the bronze as my youthful competitors were quite talented.Making quick time of the next few miles to Wind Rock we sure are happy it’s lunch time. But first let’s get a look see off the ledges. Powder covered the rocks and rime ice coated the tree tops. Here we stand above them gazing thru the fog looking for our one break of light to see. AND NO WIND. I am amazed. Every time here I’ve been gusted away and run off the edge. Gathering around a big fire ring we have our lunch. Hot soup, hot dogs and some valentine love from granny…..Hershey Kisses. Yumm. A touch frozen in the middle wow must be colder than we thought. Shoot my low fat cheese on my peanut butter crackers turned to a card board like consistency. Not the treat I was looking for.Soothed by our kisses we bebop back down the trail. Needing to warm our hands and bodies from the break it’s to double time hiking. Good trail along with good conversation and we are back to the lone pine. Leaving our snow a damp wind blows up the trail. Burrr feels like weather is coming. Specks of snow fall again and fade. Our toes and legs feel the down. Wow did we really climb all this TJ asks. I’m ready to be at the shelter Anna says. I point out the old trail to our left and then to our right as their paths cross. Glad we’re on this one. Did I just see a person? A blue image moves by the shelter. It’s a hiker. He started in PA heading south but not for Springer. He’s already done his thru hike in ’97, planning to get off the AT at Cheoah Bald where the Bartram Trail intersects. He doesn’t want to hit the influx of new AT hikers heading for Maine. Good luck to you we wish and head on to our car. Meandering back we talk about our hike in the next few months and where we’ll be hiking in years to come. But first don’t miss these white blazes TJ instructs his trail squaw. You don’t wanna have to come back and walk these few feet would ya? Anna huffs and marches over across the road to pick up the blazes to check off yet another section of the trail in their books","Johns Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443101,"How long does it take 2 feet of snow to melt? A long time. How hard is hiking in it? Pretty darn tough. How pretty was it this weekend? Pretty darn pretty that was it was. And, how much fun is it walking in snow in shorts? It’s the best. Anna and TJ were already in short when I picked them up for our trip back to Wind Rock. I knew it will get probably get warm enough for that but was a little leery knowing what “the rock” can bring. They don’t call it ‘wind’ rock for nothing. And well rock for that matter. Could have been called Rocks of Ages. You gonna get both the wind and rocks on this hike.Stony creek valley was quite nippy this morning. Stepping off the road into the thicket of cold damp rhododendron the heat went right out of us. Chilly bumps whelped up on Anna’s legs and my finger tip went numb in no time. Snow still dusted the ground and the sound of water was all around us from the mountain’s run off. Too stubborn to put on any more warm protection than we started with we were determined to make this a 60 degree day. Rock hopping across the branches we kept our feet dry, at least for now. Will the trail switchback up the steep part to the shelter they ask? Not a chance. One thing I remember most from this section it has no mercy on the hiker traveling northbound. Luck us we get to experience it in both directions. Straight the hell up she goes with one only turn, not even enough to label a switchback, to Bailey’s Gap Shelter. A narrow path just wide enough for your feet and your sticks. Bring if you gottem but don’t leave them at home for Pete sakes. Yep that’s what my 2 youngins did. Ran off without their sticks. Oh boy this WILL be an adventure sure hope there’s no snow up there…..Wow what a burn my legs are on fire. Gotta get out of these pants. Shorts feel good. Bring on the sun baby, blue skies lead the way. I see you mr. snow over on the adjacent bank. I make fun as we pass it by, dry underneath our feet. Oh was I about to get a surprise. We round the next bend of the trail and there it is, the white stuff. TJ’s in his light tennie shoes as well as Anna. He had thought about grabbing those yak trak but blew them off for rougher times. I have mine on my pack but remember the last time I wore then thru this minefield. The rocks shredded them to nothing. Let the snow hike begin.At first it was fun, it was exciting, it was cool. Hiking in shorts and in the snow makes you feel free and refreshed. But then the snow got a little deeper and the trail got a little harder to find and then ‘where the hell are the white blazes?” Being the Lead dog I am I resort to instinct and trail awareness…haha….see those downed trees, they have been cut for the path..let’s proceed there. Let the adventure hiking begin. Each of us takes turns spotting a blaze. We make a pretty good run at staying on course. Rocks rolling underneath the 8 inches of snow makes unsure footing and a few near slip ups. One miss step put me in a crevasse so to speak. My leg plunging down up to my knee and a bit of a squeal like a girl came out. Laughing Anna comes to my assistance. Glad I had those sticks or I might have been a gonner. All in all we are enjoying ourselves and really making pretty good time under the conditions. Thank goodness it is warm and the feet aren’t cold even though quite wet. Some deeper snow drifts have to be tackled as we finally reach the crest of Salt Pond Mountain. Luckily foot prints, aka post holes, are left for us to walk in at the deepest points. Ah a blast of warm air greets us and the sight of leaves is a blessing. Out of the snow for a bit my legs feel light as a feather. There’s the kiosk, Wind Rock is right up there.Starving we don’t even want to explore, food. Places everyone. We take our exact same seats as last hike here 2 weeks ago. Warm air engulfs us, no need for a jacket. TJ takes off his wet shoes and socks and lets them dry in the sun. Another hiker approaches, a fellow out for a quick trip up to the rock. He is a local out to enjoy the nice day. We let him have his time.So how many soy dogs can you eat in a minute? Me none, well maybe one, but it better be with a lot of mustard. The grocery store just opened at the kiddos korner. Anna pulls out a bag full of food. Pack of soy dogs, bottle of mustard, wraps, can of pringles and chicken salad. Glad this is a day hike. Tj knocked out three dog wraps and a chicken salad one. Anna’s dog is best with mustard and pringles all wrapped up. YUMM. I think….We don’t even want to think about the return hike so we take out time eating and then head to the ROCK. A slight breeze is all she has for us today and then her vast open mountain top view. Above tree line we can see for miles. A perfect place to honor another VA soldier. We place his gold star tribute flag on Wind Rock and thank him for his service. The time has come back down we must go. Feeling rested we hope the return trip will be easier since we have cut the snow and going down. Well we all know what that means…hold on and don’t slide up and bust your ass. We do make it pretty good helping one another as they need and of course laughing a little at those slip up and catches. Tired we do get back thru the minefield of rocks. Our legs getting tired from each toe hold. TJ is right though, the snow does help with the trickery of rock dodging. Not being able to see them you just walk over the snow pack and go one. We take a break to celebrate coming to the end of the snow adventure and have our oranges. Little chipmunks come out of the woodwork to investigate. Humans, humans, they always leave us something. Oh I dread this downhill to the road but gotta do it. My sticks shrink an inch or two from me leaning on them for knee relief. Ah to be youthful, the duckling right on my heels. They did plead for the bottom after the first half mile, as did I. Back to the damp rhode path it is like air condition in here. Ahhh we say this feels good. I’m not sure what’s the best…that feeling from early this morning or the feeling now. All I know it feels good to just be hiking.","Baileys Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/446038,"Has it been 3 weekends since I have hiked? Feels like an eternity. Rain or shine we shall hike today. We are looking for a little bit of spring. Sick and tired of snow we all chime in that we are ready for Spring to spring and warmer weather. About that time a snow flake falls on the car windshield and by the time we park the car at the three-way above Woods Hole the woods are white. Well guess what, SNOW or SHINE we ARE hiking so put on them gloves, toboggans and a smile and let’s go!!!Anna and TJ haven’t walked this stretch I have planned today. So with our little blast of snow and new ground up head should make for an interesting day. We left my car at the parking below Angels Rest and we’ll hike back to it in hopes of meeting Hudson. He is the husband to Big Lu and they run a hostel in Connecticut. She helped shuttle us from Maria McCabe’s to the train station last year. What a great bunch. It would be so cool to run into him today. Branches hang white with fresh wet snow. The path is quite tight with the limbs brushing me as I lead us along. Good thing this rain jacket is on or I’d be soaked. Walking at a quick pace to warm up we break out of the narrow path to a rock trail and snow fog. This usually happens when the air isn’t that cold. The fog just settles all around the ridges. This just might hamper the view from our first stop, Doc’s Knob.View? What view? TJ laughs as they scramble out on the rock ledge. I point to where another outcropping is on the adjacent ridge above Wapiti and the Ribble Trail. Yep I tell you IT IS OVER THERE, trust me. Fog drapes the landscape while we look out above the tree line below us. Oh well maybe we’ll have a view from the next overlook at Wilburn Ridge by this afternoon.Anna is sporting her new hiking tights today. Very sporty. Sure hope I don’t need this for our big trip she says. We are ready to pack light and only where shorts and t-shirt. Shoot TJ just might hike barefoot. He’s almost done that in his old worn out TOMS, vented in the back and toes busted out they were classic hiker trash footwear. The trail turns off the hill to an old fire road which we follow for almost 3 miles. Winding along in the holler, thru various rhode thickets and some slight stream crossings. Say aren’t those fresh cut branches? And that stream looks cut out. I wonder if Big Ralph has been thru here doing some trail maintenance. He has built a whole network of trails off the AT toward Mill Creek. I hear voices, me too. Two hikers are stopped in the trail, one putting socks over her hands. Ha been there done that, right Harry? They are from TN and are out finishing a section they missed last year hiking back to Woods Hole. So no Hudson guess he’s taking a zero or already out in front of us now. Lunch time is calling us so we decide to gamble and hike up the only real climb on this trip before stopping. Leaving the fire road its ridge walk and hopefully no driving winds. TJ points out a small overhang of rocks to the south side of the mountain. We can use this as a wind break. Perfect! Anna comes out of her jacket she’s so warm. Views are breaking out, birds are gliding above on their gusts of wind and we are tucked so no one would even know we are here. Now this is hiking!Tuna fish samich, chips, peanut butter and graham crackers, bojangles and biscuits. We had a feast and more….desert…well almost. TJ breaks another new version of a Cliff bar, Coconut chocolate chip. HUMMM was more like drinking banana boat sunscreen to me. No no its like drinking a pina colada Anna says. Well either way we have just shot down TJ’s happy ending to his lunch. Hey that’s what women are for.Creeping up out of our hole the wind pops me in the face and I quickly change ball cap for boggin. Yikes old man winter is still here. See the River? Narrows? Hurry let’s not stand long under this power line we have no protection. Scurrying along we quick step it. Shoot we’ll have these next 4 or so miles done in no time. Looks some tents. Yep 3 tents set right on the edge of Wilburn Ridge. Wew that will be a cold night’s stay. Heck its cold now standing still. Not sure if thru hikers but we suspect not as they are stopped way too early in the day and I think I saw a large coleman gas container like you’d hook to a grill. Way too big to carry far. With still not much of a clear view we decide not to stop along the overlooks left not even Angels Rest. We’ll have the same view of the river from that side of the mountain here where we start down.1.7 left and ALL DOWN. Our feet and knees told us…. quit!!!! The trail is really rough from all the snow and ice melt. It has thawed and refrozen making humps and shoe prints. I almost face plant getting tripped up with a small snare root. Anna shouts out with my fear. Of course my youthful agilities kept me upright but it was a close call. Feeling good otherwise we smile as we walk out of the woods reflecting on yet another good hike on the trail. As they say it’s not about the miles it’s about the smiles.","Woods Hole-Three Way

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/448386,"What a nice surprise I had pulling onto Clendening Road. Big Ralph and his stickered up van was spotted. Hey he must be joining us today. I had no idea but I had contacted him for fine tuning my directions of where to park and hike on the new relocation trail to the Rice Fields. Bonnie was all set to get a new experience with some adventure hiking as I was the only choice for Lead Doggin. Now with Ralph in front I have no fear of taking a wrong turn up the mountain. You can forget about parking at the old spot now. That area is fenced off and grated for heavy logging truck use now. With the new gas line, going in over the mountain and to the Celanese plant a mess it has made. So we parked at the parking area in front of the gym and then rolled up in Ralphs van for our short drive up Pocahontas road. Here is where my confusion was as where to park but once Ralph pulled off the road it all made since. Small red flags stuck up from the ground going up the back to the new trail. Bonnie was a bit perplexed seeing NO path from the road up the bank. “Are we following these now? Where’s the white blazes?” A 10 foot bank stared her in the face as Ralph took 2 big steps and was up it in a flash. I even hesitated a bit and got a running myself. Bonnie revved up her legs and powered herself up. Red flags turned to new trail and walking was easy. Trail maintenance at its best. The builders have laid a good flat base with long switchbacks heading up the mountain. This will be a much easier approach to the fields than the original north trek. Not blazed yet we follow Ralph’s lead and listen to his marvelous tales and laugh at every turn. He plans to attend the sawyers class to become a certified chainsaw worker. I’d say cutting since age 15 qualifies Ralph but safety is the key he says after telling us a story of a fellow cutting his face into from a kick backed saw. His friend is as good as new today but was a sight at the time. Setting an easy pace for us to keep up with Ralph brings us the fire road and directs right so we can make the left turn back up the mountain on the rock steps. NOW I know exactly where I am. Here is where the trucks drove us in last two times to access the new trail and to continue on with the work cutting more. I do believe I would have stammered upon this but sure glad we have our tour guide today. Showing Bonnie the area’s we have worked on was a feeling of accomplishment. I can imagine what the everyday worker must feel about his or her work every time they walk up here. Great job guys we appreciate you!!!!Ralph also shows us his local knowledge of our surroundings pointing out Angels Rest, Doc’s Knob, Turnhole Knob/460 and just about every dip in the ridge lines. Bonnie says it’s like hiking with The Captain. It’s pretty darn close that’s for sure but we all know….there’s only one CAPTAIN!!!Starting up the old water trail the new path takes us across to a freshly red flagged side hill route. Wow those ROTC cadets really moved some rock in here. Big holes are left for more workers to fill and smooth before this will be for actual white blaze use. This will make for a beautiful section to see off toward the town of Narrows. Running out of red flags we turn up toward our right and crest into the field. Bonnie is all turned around. I can tell she is wondering where the hell that shelter is again. Look up ahead and there it will be. Wind wind always wind up here. We round the corner of the shelter and Ralph is already talking to 2 thru hikers. Slow Poke and WHAT. He had just told us about picking up some fellows at Sugar Grove last week and lookie who’s here? It’s the same 2. Happy to see him they ask for an autograph. Signing a red truckers hat he puts his Mill Creek Narrows mark on it. Many signatures have already been gathered so far on WHAT’s journey. Southern boys with big smiles they even get a little cheezier when Bonnie and I half our sandwiches to share with them. Peanut butter, Banana and Blueberry jelly. Glad I had cut my sandwich in half with Ralph’s knife before he showed us how sharp it was by shaving the hair on his leg. He can put an edge on a knife let me tell ya!!Sending good wishes to our friends we walk off our separate ways into the fields. North they go and South we go back on the original AT. Familiar once again. High blue skies and wispy clouds.We meet more hikers on the way back. 2 retired couples from PA out for 5 days ending up in Daleville. ‘we are section hikers on the AppalaCHIAN trail’ the lead gal says. I say you mean AppAaaLAAAChian don’t ya? A good laugh was had and dialect exchanged. Then we came across 2 gals thru hiking. Young chicks one from Ohio packed very light verses a VA gal loaded down with bulky gear but said her pack weighted the same as her hiking friend. Maybe honey but your load looks way more tiring to carry than hers. Good luck! Then our last groups was 3 lads from Detroit out on spring break heading south to warmer climate, hiking from Pearisburg to Rt. 42 Sinking Creek. Identical REI packs looking for an adventure. Have Fun Guys!Warm air greets us as we move off the mountain. What a great day it has been for a hike. Old trail, new trail and new faces from other places.","Pocahontas Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451096,"Back on the trail and tucked into my tent. Life is Good.I couldn’t wait to leave my work today watching the clock from 10 o’clock till noon. 1:00 came and I was in my trail duds darting out the office door barely saying good bye. Jim and I met at Raphine exit. Buddy Coonhound yodeling as they came off the exit. With travel delays and some parkway roadwork we decided to opt for the mid-walk into camp, 2.2 miles.Its 5:00 now and we have a cooler of trail magic to deposit on our walk in. Sodas, bananas, oranges and apples, a nice treat for a thru-hiker. Well any hiker as a matter of fact. Located between this Three Ridges Overlook and Reeds Gap it will have foot traffic for sure.A brisk breeze causes me to zip on my pants and hope this isn’t a freezing cold night. Even with the sun out it isn’t but 50 degrees. Another concerning forming quacking is my feet. I am trying out my newest Salomon’s tennies. These are very light with not much support around the toe box and I am already finding my toes are feeling cramped. I know what can happen with that problem, BLACK TOES. Oh man that’s no fun and we have a big down to start out tomorrow. It must be due to my big pack instead of my day pack. I’ve worn these shoes on hikes before but all day trips and loved them. Not taking any chances I am already committed to losing the liner socks for the rest of this trip.The walk into Maupin Field got our blood pumping and me eager for tomorrow. Reeds Gap parking areas was full of cars, wonder if they will all be at the shelter. We hear voices as we approach our destination. The grassy area here is much nicer for camping than down by the shelter and the creek. Colder and no sun down that way. Buddy finds a sunny spot to call his home too. After setting up our camps we get water and meet a pack of college boys from the Chesapeake Bay area. Their tent was fresh out of the box at Walmart big as a castle and enough room for 6. When I asked where they were hiking too they said without hesitation: HERE! Too funny. Having our dinner the sun fades and a chill comes in the air. We discuss gear we have and new purchases made since we last hiked together. Jim has made his newest pack and also fashioned a nice new tarp tent with matching ground clothe edged off with eyelet for stacking down. Now that’s cool. Baum Proof Gear at its finest. 9:30am A few night hikers pass us, light passed thru my tent as their head lamps scan around. Too dark for me and too late to be hiking. I would be afraid I’d miss something. You may laugh a little now…just stay tuned for what can be missed….","Three Ridges Overlook BRP

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451274,"Good Friday Baby, Good Friday. 18 miles down, a great camp site with pink skies sailors delight. Cozy in my sleeping bag fortified and dog tired. I am literally lying down while trying to write – plum spent. The quote of the eve was “we should have started this project in our 20s.”Speaking of 20s we saw a posse of them 20 year olds doing just that, having their life events or just living in the moment. Camping, enjoying Easter break and then those in for the long haul to Maine.A long haul is exactly what it was today. We set out to prove we could do 18 miles and to see if we are ready for our Roan Mtn trip coming up in a couple of weeks. We hit the trail at 8am and pulled in to Spy Rock camp at 8pm. WEW, we just got our tents up as last light faded into the distance. A spectacular vision indeed. Jim opened his eyes this morning to a fog covered camp. What the hell? It was a clear night and there’s not supposed to be any weather this way today. It’s Good Friday for Pete’s Sake! It’s the Martha Curse. I have yet to come to this mountain and see off of Three Ridges. AHH not again I say. Heading up Bee Mtn our first approach towards Three Ridges the clouds hang heavy but I have hope. I’m feeling pretty good. I have ditched those liner socks like I said I would and the shoes are fitting better today. Hope I can stay light in my loafers come later this eve HAHA.We have planned to take a couple of scheduled stops for water reload and breaks. Buddy Coonhound is turning into a fine Sherpa. Jim has a couple of liters of water in Buddy’s doggie pack along with food. So when we need fresh water along the way we take a bottle from the “Sherpa” and then reload at the next source. Buddy has his fresh water along the way too all treated with Clorox drops to keep the germs away. I have my sweet water treatment as well for back up. Yes we went totally filter less this trip. Humm we might do that already, I think, where’s Noni?Coming over the North rim of Three Ridges we get our first peek of THE Priest. YES. Massive he is looking over all of Montebello and Steels Tavern. We will be there this afternoon. But first we must descend some 2900 feet to the Tye River working our way over the rocky trail and various rock structures, Hanging Rock, Chimney Rock and the Ridges themselves. On breaks we meet some thru hikers some slacking and some busting it all out fully loaded.Down down my feet are a little fiery. Had it been a hot day I would have soaked them in Harpers Creek when he stopped for water. Remembering one of my first overnights an Easter or few ago I recall the rustle of an emergency blanket in the night along with a holler for help that a zipper was stuck. Yo Sandra- Dotson #2 you out there??Yodeling for joy Buddy brings us across the Tye River and not a moment too soon. I’m famished and ready for a set down. Finding a sunny spot in the parking area off Rt. 56 we gobble down our goodies. Now I’m not sure if Moose Goo is really a goody or not. Jim is into not only making his gear but some new trail foods as well. I’ve already tasted his delicious Baum Proof Protein Power Packed Breakfast Bars. If the name isn’t enough of a mouth full you just try the chocolate kale delight this treat is. Moose Goo on the other hand is more like quik-cret and carpenter might use to gum up a seam in the wall. This peanut butter, protein powder, corn meal mix held together with honey was none other than awful. Yes I would eat it if on the trail for months. Not days or even weeks could coaxed another taste. Jim swabs another goldfish up with it….9 miles down, 9 more to go. Breaking it down in parts makes it so much easier. So let’s say 5 miles and we’ll be preaching with The Priest. Then 4 more miles and we’ll be resting at Spy Rock.Leaving the river we’ll get our next water reload at Cripple Creek and have a mile or so behind us. Little things can mean so much. A mile here a mile there, A fresh spring patch of flowers, a ray of sun. Trillium, Blood Root, Dutchman Britches I love spring along the trail. Gearing up this 3000 foot climb I’m feeling really good and I believe my hiking buds are too. Trail grades nicely for us to even make some conversation. Long switchbacks. A rock overlook with 1000 feet left makes for a good rest stop and an opportunity for 1 of 2 Gold Star Tributes. I plant my flag and give thanks for SGT Shawn Dunkin’s service. Cold wind chills me and I put on some more layers and gloves to warm. What a mistake. Didn’t I just say we had 1000 feet more to go? Dumb Ass. Jim’s gone on ahead with Buddy in the lead. Hey wait I want a pull up this mountain too. I’ve hit the wall. With each slight crest a false summit again and again. Push girl push. Jim laughs as I come into view. I was a sight, a hot mess. Get me out of this shirt! It’s stuck to me AHHH. Preaching to the Priest, this fat lady has sung. Next stop Priest Shelter for our last chance of water for the day. We’ll have to camel up and hike in what we will use for tonight at Spy Rock and the short hike out tomorrow. Calling Buddy, Sherpa Buddy can you please haul my drink? Well we can’t rely on that too much as he will need most of what he carries for himself. Selfish Dog!The shelter area was crawling with campers. I say campers since not a one was set up in the shelter. A thru hiker will usually take advantage of the shelter for a quick and easy place to rest and less energy to setting up tent or tarp. Not always but lots of times. Looking at the time I know we gotta roll. I don’t mind hiking into camp at dark but don’t wanna walk much IN the DARK. I might miss something. 5:00 now and next thing I know it’s 20 of 6 and we haven’t left the shelter yet. It’s that dang Moose Goo. Takes too long to swallow that stuff plus you’ll need an extra liter of water to wash it down. Getting my last trail snack myself I’m pack ready carrying the most water of the trip, 2 full liters. Reaching Crabtree Falls road we have 3 puds to get over which will help track our progress and those last burn outs of the legs. Our feet and legs are holding up, now it’s all mental. Each flat spot on the trail called to us “camp here”. It did look inviting but we have our goal and Spy Rock is it. Pud one down Crabtree Farm road past, Pud two down Cash Hollow rd past. Jim makes a last effort to contact his dad in case we have no service at camp. His phone wouldn’t get out so he tries mine with success all the while I have taken a rest against a log laying down flat with my head resting back nicely for a quick moment of shut eye. Wow I almost dropped off maybe this WILL be my camp? We have about 2 more miles to go and a little less than an hour before dark thirty. The excitement of finishing 18 miles gets us up that last PUD and in site of a few camp fires. Yes yes that has to be the tent sites below Spy Rock. Our eye is on the finish line and we don’t even notice that this path to camp is NOT white blazed. This defined path leads directly to the rock structure I recall. Groups of college kids are already set up for the night with big tents and big fires. Yeehoo maybe we can get a hotdog. We pick out our tent spots and set up while a lovely sunset brightens the last of the day. I can’t wait to get into my evening ware and have some camp beverage. This tree will do nicely for my recliner. I can watch Jim finish his tarp set up and the kids pass the bottle around. Buddy has ditched his pack and made himself a leaf bed to tussle in, rolling around on his back moaning as if to say AHHH. Cooking by headlamp we have a big supper. Max Patch Mac and Cheese, Mashed Potato Soup, Pepperoni and Cheese. I could have had another round. Tired we don’t last long chatting. One last “here’s to a big day” toast and lights are out.","Maupin Field

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451300,"We have already had some quotes now for the lessons. Lesson #1 Never trust your memoryLesson #2 Never trust a local dressed in blaze orange and cottonLesson #3 Never doubt to need for following a white blazeLesson #4 Never assume you won’t need breakfast or water on the “short” walk outAnd finally Lesson #5 when all else fails return to what you know, regroup with whoever is with you, take a breath and retrace your steps and find that damn blaze….A gust of wind wakes me this morning along with the voices from our college campers. They were up till at least mid-night when I took my last dose of Vitamin I. Clouds and cool air wisp around us more so on Jim and Buddy than I since they are tarp tenting. We break camp early so we can get a move on home. We’ll first check out the view from atop Spy Rock.I decide with the short walk out I’ll just stay in my evening ware, long johns under my pants and a few layers on the top. Heck it’s only 1.5 to the car and no need in getting all hiker dressed for just that. Shoot I’ll just eat my last Baum Proof bar with a cold beer at the finish line so no need in carrying this last water off either. Here Buddy you knock this out and Jim and I will finish the last of my lemon drink.We step from our camp spots back on the path that lead us here and head for the rock. Funny we both comment wonder why they don’t have this blazed. I don’t see a white mark around. Oh don’t worry Jim I know the trail doesn’t go over the rock it goes around I’ve been here before.I drop my pack and sticks just at the foot of the climb. Jim leaves sticks but wants the pack for that ‘special’ shot from above. Buddy has his empty pack on too and amps up the nerve to climb.Scrambling for a toe hold we scratch up the rock face testing our rock climbing skills. Buddy makes it with a little nudge and lift from Jimbo. A tent and 2 folks come out to greet us. Hey that’s the blaze I saw on top of the rock last night. It was a guy in a blaze orange hunting jacket. They have camped up here, cool. Spy rock has a full 180 degree view all around. A grassy path lays out over the rock like a red carpet to the front door. What a perfect spot for another Gold Star Tribute. Thank you Spec Jared Kubasak for your ultimate sacrifice. Taking our last photo opts we ask the dumbest question ever..which way to the AT? Again I am still on memory mode and believe the trail will be back where I left my pack. It will just go right around this rock and we’ll be on our way to Fish Hatchery Road. Jim on the other hand has never been here and takes the young man for his word…go right down over this rock ledge and you’ll come into the AT. It all goes south from here….Jim’s off the other side I’m down getting my pack on but first need to take off some clothes. I’m hot. Wish I had a drink of water. No worries I’ll be done soon and will have all I need. Humm no blaze still. I wonder down and around then back to where I started. Then go back up the way we climbed. Oh yea that’s a blaze..maybe…2 marks could have passed for a blaze but I KNOW the trail doesn’t go over the top. Jim’s long gone. I’m back to my “guide” he said oh yea just go on over the way Jim went and you’ll come to the blazes. After much wondering and separation anxiety I resort to “HEY JIM…HEY JIMBO!?” HOOTIE HOOT…Jim hollers back MARTHA, MARTHA. Good I think he has found the trail. All the while he thinks, good Martha has found the trail. Finally back in each other’s sights we decide best to go back AGAIN to the rock. Ya know they don’t call it Spy Rock for nothing. Let’s get our barring’s and hit reset. You can image the look on the campers faces when we crested the top for my 3rd time. Nothing to do but laugh. “you see that path down there?” Yep that’s where we camped I say. Well you just go on back to the SIGN and hang a left you’ll be headed for Fish Hatchery Road. The AT is right there. HOLY SHIT. I know I there was a reason I don’t night hike…I might miss something!!! Yep we walked right past the sign that said Spy Rock > and left the AT last night. Buddy looks up at us while we make him go back down almost to say I could have told ya that.Walking past our camp site and gal asked weren’t you the 2 just here? Yes we say and brush off any further inquiry by saying “oh yea we just explored the rock and now it’s time to go home”. Took us damn near 40 minutes to do all that too. White Blazes take me out of here and before we knew it we’re at the Fish Hatchery Road. So again refer to my above Lessons or you just might miss something…..","Spy Rock

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452548,"Spring really is here. Flowers on every hillside, trees a buddin, and wild life spotted. I was so excited about taking my hiking company to a section new to them. Love Thunder Ridge Mountain and all its little sites.We will drop a car on the way up the Blue Ridge Parkway past Peaks of Otter. This spot I have only been to once and was with The Captain when he GPSed his truck we were leaving to hike back to. We also started at Petites Gap like us today. Once again I am relying on my memory and a little guidance from the RATC website. Leaving my car I’m thinking “sure hope when we come out from Cornelius Creek Shelter that we end up here”! Bonnie was right flowers ARE in bloom. Petites Gap glistens with white blooms, Trillium. Then we spot dozens of Trout Lillies. You guys can enjoy these real closely as you’re heads gonna be down for a while, I say. We got 2000 feet to climb over these next 6 miles to crest Thunder Mountain 4225Ft. Warm sun pleases us. We’ve been in wind and cold for all our hikes this season. Today is already the best hike I’ve been on TJ says and we’ve only walked 10 minutes. A pleasant grade gets us warmed up for some increasingly steeper trail I see up ahead. This ain’t no Priest but I am working hard to see the first plateau. Once on Thunder Ridge, our first of many sites we take a breather and share some fruit. We got all day to do these 10 miles so let’s enjoy. Cruising along its story time and I’m completely involved in my own voice and come to a screeching halt..SNAKE…Anna runs up by backside. Wo Wo he’s crossing the trail. Croc Dundee jumps quick to defend us or was it just to entertain. TJ has Mr. No-Shoulders wrangled up with stick and hand for all to see. Turning him loose I see a snake with every crocked branch lying around the trail. I hate that feeling.Soon we reach two great views of Devils Marbleyard. Yet another place I been and want to share with the ducklings. Bonnie has climbed the rocks with me before and remembers our many adventures on the side trails that way. Hikers are a plenty. Section hikers, day hikers and a few thru hikers. We talked to one gal, Cozy, who we think was from Florida. She had attempted her thru last year but game off in Vermont when the mast of the thru-hikers thinned out and she felt uneasy in the shelters. She skipped up to Maine. She was a cautious type having been a former police officer and didn’t take kindly to other carrying guns along their way. So she’s back out picking up where she left off and its Vermont Bound or Bust. Looking forward to our lunch we have one more climb to crest before we come to Thunder Mtn Shelter. Sure is getting warmer too. Not leaf cover yet and the sun bakes on our shoulders. Sunscreen gets slathered on. Check it out guys, you can see the big radar tower up ahead. You can see this big white ball on its pedestal from the Interstate and now we can almost reach it. We shall be up close and in person right after lunch.We have the shelter to ourselves, good thing right Anna? I am ready to take off my shoes and chow. We had food from one end of the shelter to the other already deciding to share sparingly if thru-hikes come in. And 2 do. They are starving too hardly saying hello before digging into their food bags and reading the shelter log. So what kind of tree would you be if you could be a tree? That was the big question a friend of theirs has written for other to ponder. We play along too. I’d be a Red Bud. I like their vibrant color and they grow in hard to reach places like I like to hike, Up a Hill! Humm The Captain I think would be a Shag Bark Hickory. Yep he’s a pretty shaggy TJ says. Bonnie would be a Dwarf Maple. “No no I’d be a Japanese Cherry” she corrects me. We wish them well and hike on to our next trail treats of the day. THE Guillotine. Sounds scary doesn’t it? A huge rock structure with a big ball of rock stuck between its sides. The trail runs right under it. Nothing doing but scamper to the top. Yikes the old ladies will stay down here thank you while the kiddos make their way out on the suspended rock. Cheese and don’t fall making for a great photo opt. But wait there is MORE. Yes yes we still have the big ol soccer ball to come to, the air force radar tower I told ya about. It’s coming in just a few 100 yards. What a fantastic view from 4225 feet. Anna is ready to take a big ol nap on top of the grassy plat. TJ instead takes the weight of the world on his shoulders. You’ll have to see the picture to get that. There’s the parkway below, the interstate and over there is the Peaks of Otter. We are 6 miles in and 4 miles out. Have you got any left in ya?Smiling that the hardest of the trip is past and not to mention the best sites we are off this mountain. A fairly easy down the trail winds thru switchbacks and then a few puds to keep us working to get back to the car. Shooweee I’m hot. These gaps we drop into are hot and not a bit of air stirring. Anna is wishing she had some cold water and wondering if they’ll have enough to finish. Sharing a pack is nice but not knowing how much the other is drinking puts them into conservation mode. I myself had moments thinking the same thing and am already looking at the map for the next water source. We’ll come to one just past Cornelius Creek side trail. Bonnie’s calm, cool and collected announcing she has her water all accounted for by packing a full 2 liters for the day. HAAgain I’m in mid story time and come to a quick halt…what another snake? Nope listen, that’s water trickling. Sure enough running just off to our right is the stream. We each dig in our packs for our left over Gatorade bottles and fill and drink and fill and drink. HAAAA cool wet water. Never tasted so good. You’d think we were out in the desert. Whistles wet and faces cooled we are rejuvenated. Where’s that next overlook?Blackrock it is. Under the nice cover of rhododendrons we almost have a bounce in our steps as we approach our last site of the day. In the fall this spot is spectacular. Today it has its own uniqueness. The trees aren’t fully leaved yet so the lines of green are sparse but the view is vast. We take our spots around on the rocks to get our own special views. Peaks of Otter stand just a ridge away the closest we’ve been to them except on the drive up. Had we not had to get back home I do believe we’d found ourselves waiting for the sun to set from here.So where exactly are we turning off to get to your car, Bonnie asked. How do we get out of here? Ya’ll don’t let me miss that turn. Crossing the same creek twice on the way out it was like Déjà vu. I kept thinking the turn for the shelter is right up ahead and then we rounded the curve and that same creek was there HUH?? Finally the sign appeared and I knew exactly where we were, .3 from the car. Ya’ll just follow me. Passing the shelter, another new privy and then to the jeep road. Well the RATC site said left so here we go. Now I did have in my mind we’d come in behind where I parked but it was across the road. Hey at least I had us in a few steps vicinity as TJ spots my car. Ah yes what a fine site.","Petites Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453934,"Drop a car here, meet a hiker there. See a flower here see a flower there. Sun trickles thru the tree branches just filled with fresh greenery for the season. A little breeze moves around us…Ahh Easy like Sunday morning. That’s exactly what our hike was today. Easy Peezy. Just us two chicks today the kiddos are cramming knowledge for exams. Glad Bonnie was up for some hiking. Larry heard there was food after and will join us in Ironto later. Leaving my car at 311 parking lot below McAfee we head over to where the trail crosses route 624. No one is parked here yet so Bonnie has plenty of room. Hee Hee. A 6 miler today we joke about that used to be the normal mileage short of 1 or 2 at the most. Shoot Bon us seasoned hikers are all about double digits now and today’s trek would satisfy us till first lunch on the big trips. Flowers bloom out at every turn up the first hill to our creek crossing. Trillium, columbine and more columbine. I have to say I don’t think I have been on this section this time of year with such color. Easing along we take picture after picture trying to capture the beauty. We find a nice camp spot just before the bridge and hope to come in one day and test it out. You couldn’t fish here, not deep enough but you sure could soak the feet and relax along its banks. Just before entering the open valley we run across a box turtle eating in the shadows. He was camouflaged well in the leaves but I spotted him. Crossing the several fence stiles in the fields it’s time to turn UP miss Bonnie. Ah the dreaded field exit to the ridge. It’s the only real climb of the day and early is better than late. We’ll have it behind us and cruise the rest of the way. Feeling froggy I march up the path and wait on her in the pines and take in the view over to Dragons Tooth. Now that’s a climb. Just inside of tree cover 2 trail runners come fast…HOT SOUP, HOT SOUP! I call out. They laugh at us and fly over the stile and disappear. We guess they’ll pass us on the return but we never see them again.Cresting the ridge a gust of wind about takes our hats off. Good to have it or we’d be sweaty wet. We have views over toward the Catawba B&B and we’ll soon come in sight of The Homeplace. A side trail is to be put in soon to this delicious eatery for easier access from the AT but we did not spot yet. However thinking back I do remember a fork in the trail which put us on the south side of the mtn and thought the other path used to be the old AT. Maybe next trip we can see where it does go. Well they don’t call the Sawtooth Ridge for nothing as we passed up and over many rocky peeks but we never lost must elevation either way. Butterflies light on the pink pleasantries of wild azaleas. Look Bonnie!! Lady Slippers. Oh what a find. Snap snap our cameras go. A few more hikers are past and the trail widens which always means you are coming close to a trail access point. 2 fellows come along asking it they are close? Close to what I ask? Are you looking for McAfee Knob? Ah yes with an Indian ascent one replies. Well fellas you are headed the wrong way. A few minutes later a lady pops out of the bushes startling us both. “I should look both ways before entering traffic she says” A good laugh we have. She was killing a little time on the trail while waiting for some scouts to come for her shuttle ride. She didn’t work for a hiker shuttle but rather was a friend of the troops. Reminiscing about past hikes over these grounds we soon arrive at the parking lot and see a nice spot to take a rest before meeting up with Larry. We’ll hiker watch for a bit. Car tags, Maine, Georgia, North Carolina and VA just to mention. Here comes the scouts, 2 have beat the rest and proud to say so. Here guys have this extra Gatorade to celebrate.Kicking back we watch hikers come and go. Ah yes this is nice…it’s easy as Sunday Morning.","Cornelius Creek Shelter, BRP

A few hikers gathered around the fire pit finishing their supper, smoke lightly hangs in the air. We find our tent spots. 7:00PM and glad to be here.Excited doesn’t touch how anxious I was to get going this morning. I was packed and ready at 8:30am. Only thing else left to do was pace the kitchen floor. Back in the day Captain and I would have already hit the trailhead by the time the rooster crowed. My boys today are a tad more leisurely as we aren’t to meet up till 3:00 this afternoon. Them lawyers can’t trust’em. Jonathan has court at 11am and Jim…well… he has Buddy. Jim and I will meet in Damascus to leave my car with trail days supplies and then we’ll head on south to Mountain Harbor Hostel where Jonathan will be coming in. Plans changed that he needs to come off the trail Wednesday morning. He can just walk down the road and get his truck, which by the way has mine and Jim’s last few days supply of food. No need in carrying extra if have the option to slack anything anytime. The last part of this big plan is leaving a set of keys for Jim’s truck at the hostel. Captain will be moving it from Hughes Gap where we start and put at our finish off Wilber Dam Road. Leaving Jim’s truck we have some trail magic for our fellow hikers. Cold sodas and apples. Who knows maybe there will be 2 left over when we come to it Friday morning. Can’t you see them wondering how did this same truck get from one place to the other. A gal comes toward us heading north walking gingerly. Seeing the cooler her eyes widen and thanks us for her surprise. We ask when does she expect to hit Katahdin? Oct 15 (the last day the mountain is open to hike for the season-weather turns to threatening thereafter) Sure hope she makes it.Roan Mountain 6275 feet awaits us. 2000 feet we gotta climb to our camp right out of the gate. What’s this? Switchbacks? Graded trail? I tell you what it is…it’s Bob Peoples. Thank you Thank you. I plan to hug your neck when I see you at trail days man. He has re-routed this kick ass steep to a graded 2 more mile longer stretch. Now I wouldn’t usually wanna add miles but when you can keep your legs under ya with a full pack I’m all for it. Reaching Ash Gap 3 miles in I am surprised how quick it passed. Time flies when you’re having fun. The boys are talking up a storm. Being old buds from school and such they have many stories and current events to discuss. Jonathan got himself a trail name last hike with Jim. The Flying Burrito. Not sure how it came about but guessing it’s what he eats. A storm rolls over Grassy Ridge to our west. Hope we make camp before it catches us. Ash Gap is a fine camp spot but getting every mile in today would be very helpful come tomorrow and the next. We have planned some big miles for us and not knowing The Flying Burritos training sure don’t want to blow him out right out of the bat. More re-route is spotted but not yet in place. Hardcore will be here after Trail Days I’m guessing. That’s Bob’s work crew name. Sign up for Hardcore and help us hikers climb with ease. 900 more feet to reach the site of the old Cloudland lodge. In 1884 it opened to dignitaries and visitors. $30 for the month or $2 a night to stay. This knob will be covered with color in a few weeks with the rhododendrons peek. Maybe we can drive up here some day to see that site. I can hear the L-Train now…you mean we walked up this and could have taken a drive!!!!Thunder moves past and I spot the shelter sign, time to turn here boys. A rutted out deep path leads us into the depths of the Roan. Eerie actually. Glad I have hiker friends with me.Cooking by head lamp, laughs and Cheers to the beginning of our trip. Shush! Oh Jesus Christ comes from an adjacent tent. Ooops are we being too loud? Sorry dude didn’t know.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456783,"A somewhat restless night for me. I never sleep well the first night out, too anxious and keyed up I guess. Today holds our most highlights of the trip. It's been a number of years since I walked this and was in 2 separate sections. New ground for all the boys, Buddy Too! We broke camp as the sun was peeping between the tall fur trees. Smells like Christmas.Saying good-bye to a gal I talked with last night I lead us out and also tell the fellas about me apologizing to Mr. Shush. He accepted and I wished him a better night tonight. 
Rocky path takes us to Carvers Gap 5512 feet, an easy walk. The haze burns away and warmth engulfs us. Ahhh love it. Open fields ahead. Jane Bald, Round Knob and then Grassy Ridge. Just breathe taking. 360 degree views over these 5 miles. Buddy Coonhound even stopped to look around when we did. 
Say Skinny Legs where did you get those short shorts? Slim Jim lightened up in more ways than one on this trip. He is pulling off a Kojak haircut, head slick as a ribbon, face too. No beard. Who is this guy? TJ you gonna top this on the Northern trip? Then he decided to go skimpy shorts for light weight. Look out don't set down in them things might loose something. All kidding aside the haircut was in honor of his mom. 10 years ago this weekend she was fighting cancer and he shaved his head for her then and does so today. SAAALUTE!!!
First lunch, Stan Murray Shelter. I'm starving but only want to stop momentarily as scheduled lunch lunch will be at Over Mountain Shelter. That would put us about 7.5 miles in on this almost 16 mile day. Over Mountain was where the Revolutionary soldiers fought and held camp. A 3 story big red barn rest over the mountain in yellow gap protected from all sides. I passed seeing it last trip and really wanna check it out today. It will cost us a little over a half mile round trip to do so but well worth it. 
Man it's hot. Sun beating down and we all need to reload water. Will do so on the way out. The enormous barn has a large congregating area on the bottom with sheets of paneling to lay down on. Upstairs for sleeping down stairs for cooking the sign says. Jonathan has already laid out his bed roll and is gearing up for a nap. Good call. Food first for me though. Jim swallows moose goo while Buddy finds him a shaded area deep under the shelter floor. Digging for cooler soil he sighs when he hits the ground. AHHH
Chatty Kathy comes in. A thru-hiker with loads to talk about and circles to take us on. Puzzled was his trail name and I can see why. The rest of his clan rolls in and they too had been at Roan. They plan to camp at Apple House tonight too. This should be interesting. There's 8 or so of them. 
With our siesta cut a bit short we move on and let them spread out. Only gonna get warmer and later in the day to climb the last of our 2 big ups. Hump Hump - Humptie Dump. Jonathan is out front quick. Man what set him on fire? Watch him go. Little Hump has us a 900 foot elevation gain over 2 miles and then Hump itself is a whopping 600 foot gain in just 1/2 a mile. Daunting it is. Pushing myself to gain ground on the Flying Burrito the damn trail makes a u-turn and forces us to repeat some of the elevation we just gained over the Little Guy. What are you trail people doing to us? 
Bradley Gap gives a full span of what is to come. A long winding path leading to the top of Hump Mtn 5587 feet. Look out ""Sturgill"" we are coming to clip you! Jim calls out. Look the Flying Burrito is in a run. Yep he grabbed another gear and ran for a few yards and then slowed his pace as the mountain widens around turning him to a small moving speck. 
Bob Peoples has been all over this trail up till now. Boy am I wanting his skills here. Direct approach with no foregiveness. Mercy!!! Burn Baby Burn. Not only the legs but the sun burns down on us too. Buddy finds a small growing shrub and retreats from it all. A false summit kicks me in the teeth. Crossing a fence after the climb thus far is just plain mean. Jonathan has left from sight. Hope that means he crossed the top. A blast of wind hits me at the crest, Yes yes we have made it. Jonathan rests on a large rock area and we join him. 
This IS the best of the south Jim proclaims, the Franconia Ridge of the South. Gusts cool our sweat as we point out surrounding landmarks. Grandfather mountain, another mountain top resort on farther and then a storm front just behind us. Glad we are over this and heading to woods soon for protection if need be. It was hard to leave this spot but we must press on. 5 more miles to camp.
What goes up must come down and boy did we do just that. Rocks and rocks. Pounding my feet, OUCH. Doll Flats where are you? A storm is a movin in and the winds rush thru the gap here. A sign tells us we are leaving NC. We started in TN crossed over to NC and now heading back to TN. A tent is set up already but we move on. 2.4 to go let's keep in front of this front!!!
More down loosing 2370 FEET over the last few hours. The dogs are barking and now the drops are starting to fall. Quick put on the pack covers that always make the rain stop. I try it out and what do ya know it did work. Almost....hey we got to camp and picked out tent spots but were too tired to move quick enough to really get set up. I'm in a race with mother nature and she's about to win. I throw my gear inside and zip in. Buddy hides in a rhodie bush while Jim half pitches his tarp. Jonathan has managed to get his cover up as well but they are out of my site so not sure how sound their camp is. 
Dusk and The Posse has arrived. I hear them huddling around trying to decide who will do what. Rain pellets my roof. Tent poles clank and directions are shouted. Is this a boy scout troop? Oh lord no. Hey don't put your tent right up against mine we'll both get wet I holler out. Turns out it is the group from lunch. Rain subsides and I peek out to see what's what. A hammock is going over my right shoulder and 5 more tents are surrounding the wagon. Holy cow this might be a looonnng night. I wonder up to the boys and they are laughing at the situation I have found myself in. 
Whiskey has gone to town one hiker yells out and Puzzled is out there too. I'm guessing Whiskey has left you guys high and wet while he is getting a snort and Puzzled, well with a name like that who knows where he'll end up. Come to find out Puzzled is from a ROTC background and is all about providing for his troops. Here he comes with a super case of beer, brats, bbq sauce, chili, chips and Gatorade. He had a big pole with grocery bags hung on it over his shoulders to balance on the 1/2 mile walk back in. 
We managed to get our supper cooked before it got too late or wet again. A small foot bridge above the boys camp made a nice cook spot and gave us some space to socialize separate. Rain begins to pepper again and I don't really wanna get in bed wet or have to deal with wet rain gear. I retreat and deside it's a good time to write. 
8:30pm camp is a buzz. Beers pop, burps and sounds crack off in the night. ""Hey I'll give that a 9"", I yell out. Laughing a gal says ya'll hear That? It's The Lady in the Tent. We converse without seeing one another and before I know it I am handed a brat on a bun under my rain fly. Say thanks guys. Then another hand comes under with a tall boy to wash it down. Dynamite Dudes. You just gave a section hiker trail magic, THANKS! You've made this old ladies day!!","Roan High Knob Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456905,"We left our new friends asleep this morning. The rain has cleared and just sprinkles leftover on the trees pop us on our heads as we pack up. Hopefully we’ll see this Posse at Trail Days and even the Captain’s Hiker Feed. Hey Rodeo be sure to stop by. She is familiar with Blacksburg and had attended Virginia Tech. Hiking companion was Scout the beagle and was hiking for a cause TEAM REEVE– spinal cord injury and lightweight backpacking. Hope to see you again, says the Old Lady in the Tent.Today we lose The Flying Burrito to the salt and surf of the sea. Heading for Topsail Beach Jonathan will hike out the half mile and retrieve his car and deliver our last few days of food supplies. Good thinking SlimJim about resupply here and for the rest of the trip. More hikers are packing up as we head to the road. Glad we stayed where we did. Too close to a major highway this direction. We have a big day ahead of ourselves, 17 miles and it’s already warming up. Not complaining a bit. Bring on the heat and dry weather. Entering the woods across from 19E we wave good bye to Jonathan and begin our first up. I can’t wait to show Jim the Big Tree at Bishop Hollow. It covered a whole gap along the trail but with all the new lush foliage and field grass it doesn’t quite have the grandeur of my first view. I got a hot spot on my foot from yesterday’s down to Doll Flats over the rocks and already can tell this is gonna be a problem as the day goes on. Nothing to do but hope for a cool stream to cool my jets when possible.Bet we see a snake today Jim! Turns out it was 4. Buddy will have to keep those animals away. He is pulling Sherpa duty with some of Jim’s extra water and me if needed. We have both gone to filter less this trip. Only using bleach and MSR drops. Water has been flowing clean and clear thus far and is oh so good with each big gulp.Hear that creek? This is where Captain and I had lunch one trip. This will be a perfect place for us to dry out our wet tents and such AND take a bath. I can hardly wait to peel off my duds and jump in. But first we must hang out the laundry. Elk Branch/Laurel Falls rolls full and wide. Green field grass calls me to lie down. Buddy finds a shady tree along the creek bank as we make our way to the shore. Yikes!!! A big black snake slithers from under the weeds just by my feet. I hardly care the water is in my sights. Wading and washing I’m in heaven. Wish we could have camped here for the day. Dried out and rested we gotta get a move on. 9 more miles left in the day. Several hikers pass us by but we end up seeing them even later on in the day. The coolest dude was Hob. A fellow from the New England states. He hiked the trail in 96 and I think he said 2006 with his wife along. Back out now for another walk about and she will join him farther north for about 500 miles. A solid man in his late 60s early 70s carrying a very light looking customized Zpack. Says he prefers sleeping under the stars and plans to do so tonight if the rain holds off. Shoot he’s walking 2 miles an hour right with us and still is going farther to a camp site past the shelter. Turns out to be 21 miles. WOW you go Hob. “Maine before Medicare” as he put it. Questioning him about Maine and New Hampshire’s Whites he gives us a plethora of information. Jim, I hope you took good notes. “I think I saw Katahdin in the distance” Hob says as he fades out behind us. A steady trail keeps us in a zone. Mile after mile, creek and falls after another. A beautiful area but doesn’t hold a candle to yesterday’s sites. Where’s that darn bench? We make it there and we can have another rest and I will air my feet. A group of weekenders says the bench is just ahead. We’ll the ahead was like 2 miles. They also say a storm is due in tonight and most of tomorrow. We can only hope it lessons. Larry’s report is 100% yikes. I do believe that is Hump Mtn out there as we kick back on the memorial bench. A cool breeze brings in the feeling of a cold front. Still a very nice afternoon but you just know when it’s about to end. Pushing for that camp spot I declare I will not stop till we reach it. Every break causes the blood the rush back to my feet and pain sets in. Jim is hobbling too and Buddy is laying down with every pause in the trail. 7:00. The next water source WILL be our camp site I declare. Well so much for those words. Spots were black bottom silty water sources. Finally emerging from a thicket a big camp area opens in a rhododendron patch PERFECT!One hiker has already set camp and had his supper. I’m ready for that too. Jim gets the bear bag hung and then we collect water. Tents and tarps pitched, bird batch and cocktail time. Weather report is awful for tomorrow. We discuss our options. Should we stay or should we go? 18.2 scheduled miles or press out the Friday’s miles 2.8 and make it a whopping 21 miler!!! Right now I don’t wanna hike that many but who knows in the morning we may feel better about it. Let’s see what rain does come and decide then Jim pleads. Well I just capped off my 1 drink minimum turned 2 so I’m committed. I won’t be on the trail tomorrow night no matter how many miles we hike I boast.","Apple House Camp

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456907,"2:00AM a roar comes over my tent. Rain fills the trees and pounds the ground. Glad we have the protection of this bowl and aren’t up at Moreland Gap Shelter. I listen for Jim and Buddy, My back to them in my tent. A light goes on as he adjusts under his tarp. I imagine rain rolling over and under his sleeping bag and Buddy stepping to get closer on top of him to keep from getting wet. I check my surroundings as well by head lamp. All is secure only thing left to do is try and sleep. One hour passes and then the next. Will morning ever come? Oh the adjustments to getting back out in the woods for a few days. Hope I adjust come NY trip and sleep more sound. Rain still showers us at day break but once we both make the move to officially pack up it stops. Buddy is no fool and buries up deep in Jim’s tent to stay out of the remaining wetness. Hey Buddy Coonhound time to go baby. Wonder how many miles he thinks he’s good for today?I’m all for coming out at Dennis Cove Road 8 miles away. We have the option of walking to Kincora, Bob Peoples place and pay for a ride to Jim’s truck or we can call 2Liter and Fabio. Yep I had touched base with them prior to coming this way hoping we might see them at Trail Days. Well now “if you need anything, just give us a call she says”. COME RESCUE US !!!The big question has been, Lead Dog, if you hadn’t already walked this stretch would you have come off the trail? YES with 100% rain coming and 21 miles to get to a dry car and trail days waiting on us. YES I would have made the same decision. I can tell Jim is a tad bummed about it but agrees its best.The last 8 miles are rain free. Heavy clouds do linger but it isn’t cold or much windy. I can tell my pack is heavy with a wet tent and we take a little break at a great camp spot which I do believe is where Hob spent the night. 20.5 miles from 19E to this location. Wow. 2.5 left Jim and our hiking adventure will be over. We text and call our friends again to confirm pick up. With many mixed messages and locations before it is finally confirmed Fabio is in the area.Down down the winding path, rocks slick, wooo watch out. I take a twirl and a twist but regroup before going over the edge. Jim has his own battle letting Buddy lead us out today. His nose close to the road instead of following the scent of a woman. Nothing like a big yodel to set the woods aloud. Bob Peoples has been here too. Being this close to his house I’m sure he has many visions of bettering our path. Reaching the road dry we are thankful to have a ride coming our way or pretty sure we do anyways. We haven’t hardly gotten our seats warm on a stump when a white truck rolls up. I’d recognize that long hair anywhere, It’s Fabio. I give him a big hug and he hands us a big Sonic Limeade NICE.

We had stayed dry on the trail mostly and had taken great care to keep it that way but once we unloaded from Fabio’s truck to ours it was a lost cause. Trail Magic trash was everywhere in the back of Jim’s truck and we had to make room for Buddy to get into his crate. We chucked our packs in the back and drove off only after soaking ourselves in the transfer. 100% glad we got off the trail yesterday.Captain and Bonnie came in this morning to join us at Tom and Sandy Davenport’s. They are so gracious to let us camp in their yard during Trail Days. Canopies go up and we turn this place into our own tent city.

The parade was a tad subdued. Guessing from last year’s incident with the run-away car folks were on alert. But that didn’t stop the water gun action close to the finish line.

First it was Cascades, No that will be a mad house this Memorial Day weekend. Then he said how about that 2 mile trail that is 3. Hummm what trail was that? You know the one at Mountain Lake. I ran to get my map to see…maybe I can work some magic and turn this 2 mile trail to 4 or 5 hahaha. Then I remembered what trail he was talking about, our Honeymoon Trail.This will make 2 times ol Larry has pulled this trail out of his hat to bank some brownie points with the wife. First time was leaving our honeymoon lodge heading home from Mountain Lake and he was like let’s take the long way home and run over the mountain down by Captain’s. Salt Pond road runs right past this War Spur trail and the next thing I know he is turning in to park. My eyes twinkled just like today when he said I’ll go hiking with ya. Now we all know I loooove a long hike and one with an overlook and a possible climb or 2. Not to worry the L-Train’s got this covered in his L-train way. This loop has a slight down, which means you have to walk back up (I think that’s the .2miles to the overlook). It has an overlook, so there ya go. And if you rest long enough you’ll have that lonnng hike you are looking for. HA. We have the place to ourselves. Only 3 cars here and hopefully they are already around the loop by now. Larry elects our direction which will be clockwise. So off to the left we go so we’ll be at the overlook later in the loop for our lunch. Being already at the top of the mountain our grassy path leads us peacefully thru the woods. Sunlight makes its way around the leaves casting shadows and glimmers. Birds tweet and our sticks click on the random rocks they might hit. The slight down takes us into a dense wooded section of the hemlocks and a small creek. Storms have shattered these big trees and made quite the mess. A few flame azalea blooms hang from their branches finishing their season. We pass 2 couple along our way, one going and one coming. Then the one switchback takes us up to our side trail, .2 to War Spur Overlook. This is really the only down on the loop and well worth it. Breaking out of hardwoods and then a line of rhododendron along this rocky ledge we can finally see out over the holler. Just a few more weeks and all the rhodies will be in full bloom, nice. Larry works his way around the first setting spot to a more secluded area and we make way for our lunch. Clear blue skies with just a few high clouds. Warm sunshine and a tuna fish samich. Man it don’t get much better than this. All I need now is a little honey time. Oh yea I have that too!!! Another family comes in soon and enjoys the other section of the rocks. We finish up our visit and head on out. Leading the way Larry takes a sudden stop reaching up to his hairline and says shit! A bird just shit on me!!! Laughing hysterically I reach in my pack for something to help clean him up and notice the beautiful red/orange bird fly over to another tree. Hey is that your mystery bomber? It had black on his wings and a very small bird but bright enough to see easily in these green leafed trees. Just give me something to clean my head Larry spouts. That’s what you get for leading there L-Train. If you’d been “moving” you wouldn’t have been hit. From the junction on Larry put me back in the lead and on our way to rounding the loop. Just one last freight train of kids coming this way we past. Glad we missed that at the overlook. So our Honeymoon trail turned out to be another brownie point day. Lead dog got her hiker fix with the man she loves. AND L-Train got him some brownie points in more ways than one, thanks to Mr. Red bird.","Mountain lake

Thanks to Kiss the Cook Kenneth and his wife Donna, the deep fryers were popping. Fresh made hush puppies and French fries to boot. Fish as long as your arm had to be halved to just fit in the vats.Some hikers have been here since Wednesday waiting on this event. I’d say we fed about 30 in all including our staff/family/helpers. Tent began filling the yard and hikers gathered around a newly made fire pit. Now this isn’t some rock ring either. They guys had some sound architecture going on. A 2 tier structure rounded with flat rock they zip lined over the creek. Then a second layer for seating closing to the pit dug deep for the wood to burn in. You can leave open for more wood or cover with a crate for grilling over hot coals. I was very impressed and would like one in my back yard please.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/459507,"Captain's 10th Annual Hiker Feed kicked off with the theme bigger is better. What seemed to be a slight crowd turned out quite the opposite. With tenting religated to the outer rim of the yard and then more past the parking zone a small tent city formed without us realizing it. Nat and I counted 65 sleeping structures varying from tents to tarps to hammocks. A few even found shelter under Captain's car port area sleeping on their mats over the graveled flooring. Shoot us staffers and some family used Captain's boat as our storage for a change of clothes and supplies. We couldn't have pulled off the cooking for this crowd without Billy and Carl's Big Ass Grill. This think could hold a whole hog if you wanted but as Billy says that would be a waste to a good grill. Bonnie and I lined up 65 hamburgers, 1 super sized pack of hot dogs and a pound of bacon all at once. Heck we had more room but our arms couldn't reach to the back burner area so we didn't even light it. But let me tell ya once Billy arrived to take over the REAL grilling he had her covered. Ian was called in for back up to man the buns and slap on the cheese. We cooked 200 hamburgers, 200 hotdogs, 2 large pork loins - man a slab of that with mayo and tomato on a hot dog buns was Right! Don't forget all the sides and deserts made from our helpers. Beans Beans from Bonnie and Noni. We need more lettuce, chili, onions Kathy and Mary. Don't put out the deviled eggs Jim till we have had a chance to grab one. Four at a time was gobbled down before even landing one on a plate. Later Billy grilled a 5 gallon tub of corn on the cob in their shucks. Chick quarters for the band. Yes there was a band. More about that in a minute. Oh and ribeyes for a late night snack when all the lights went down. We'll cook till their ain't nothing left is Billy's moto.After the first wave or 5 it we started our Hiker Olympics. Backpacker Savenger to see what was in those packs and what shouldn't have been. Mr Blister - one guy won with 13 total on his feet. PeeYuuu, Stinkiest Shirt. Yikes and I had to judge this year. Thanks alot Captain. Up next, Hairest legs not only for the guys but the gals too. Lastly, Limbo the crowd favorite. Lower and lower till finally only 2 were left standing. Ben and Jerrys ice cream for all the winners and a few left over for our host. Evening settled in and the party at Stony Creek continued with our band. Second year running and they plan to come back next. The circus tent put up made a great shelter from the sun and provided an even better lights display as night fell. Hikers danced and sang as well as I. I just love a good honky tonk. More and more hikers arrived during the evening and night. Some ziplining across by way of head lamp but most made their arrangments to settle in to the Captains. The word was along the trail this was the place to be. ""I hear the Captain has the best feed"". To sum it up as one lad stated, ""this is better than trail days. You guys have made my trip complete and I will send you a card when I summit Katahdin"".

We walked right off the front porch onto the trail mad head to our first stop, Sunfish Pond. Bull frogs greeted us along with tiny pumpkinseed sunfish darting along the shores. Look out snake...right where I just got water. My legs felt a tad heavy to start the day. Will take a few days to get acclimated. I got my second wind after first lunch. 2 Advil for a heat headache and some fresh water did the trick. Second lunch was all the doctor ordered. A foot soak in a brook just below the turn for Mohican trail center. It was a popular stop offering camp food and shower. Unbeknownst to us a group of 5 that came by at this junction would become a fun part of our journey.With such a beautiful day I couldn't image that this day could much better till be reach a nice ridge walk along the edge of this unnamed territory. Grassy sections overlapped the trail and provided nice resting areas under the short trees. Man had we cameled up back there I'd vote to pitch a tent right up here. An older fella was doing just that, resting enjoying his peaceful view as we passed headed for Catfish fire tower. Later he joined us at the tower as we climbed down.

This new one is elevated on stilts and has a nice deck and porch which hangs full of our wet items from last night rain. A small pool of water crept under my tent from a poor set up due to rocky ground when putting in tent stakes. I even broke one stake off with a few blows with a rock. Thanks to Jim he gave me a spare. Titanium usually doesn't fault. Jim had a creek running under his feet down the road and had to manage that during the night. Needless to say our packs were heavy with wet tents. Thank goodness all other items remained dry.The walk out of camp was dreary with fog. It didn't take long for our shoes to get soaked either. The ridge walking thru high grasses held the moisture and just transferred it all on us. Thankfully we had some road walk to break up the also very rocky sections. My feet did pretty good considering how wet my socks had gotten. No way to even let them dry out during breaks either, way to humid and damp out. No sun.A group of camp kids came across our way at Blue Lakes Road during our first lunch. They ewe heading in to 'the' overlook. Hum did we it's pass such a thing?

Bumping into one another after dropping packs and pulling off wet shoes we all run thru the door at the same time. Scanning the 1 board menu I see my prize...large Italian sub and a Sunkist. He sliced each meat and piled the bread sections high and topped with veggies and condiments. Neatly and patiently he quartered and wrapped tightly for travel. Old joe says Hey baby you gonna eat this all at once? No sir half for breakfast half for lunch. Here's the real funny part...when ordering breakfast samich you have choice of meat with egg and cheese. All three of my compadres were asked, pepper ketchup? The boys without hesitation answer yes. Yes no substitutions here Joe. Miss Anna without her meat selection politely asks for mayo and tomato. Joe nodes and orders are UP!Eating on the outside bench the 5 hiker bunch rolls in. I have decided to name them the gerital gang. 2 older bearded fellows along with 2 ladies are hiking together with a younger guy. Might be ones son. Yet another firepower to see today, Culver's gap tower. Too foggy to see out I don't bother but what's that hanging from the braces up top? A sleeping bag. A voice calls out, permission to come aboard friends. Come join me. Moose has slept in the tower after having some fire whiskey and beers at the gaps local pub. He hiked in at 10 pm last night and said his muddled mind was led by his trained hiker legs and this was were he ended up. Quite the character.Being our biggest day thus far we don't tarry and push for sunrise mountain. Anna, Smalls encourages me on. You got that sub waiting on you Martha. Go girl go. Path is littered with rock making travel hard. Feet bruised and lower legs pain like a tooth ache. Terrane isn't that hard with rolling knolls but these rocks suck.A pavilion? Where did this come from? I never heard about a structure like this. Rock floor and pillars with a wide open covered area for seating and a fee side benches. Too bad no sun. Just rolling fog banks but hey it's still hot so not crying too much. Rest and lunch, yummy sub and still have some for first supper too.More grassy walking makes for a car wash for our feet Anna describes. We run into some other section hikers who are from this area and ask when's the sun coming back...answer September!6.5 miles to go 2:20pm. Let's blow this out y'all. More rolling knolls and some trail like home and we reach Mashipacong 'aka mash potato' shelter in record time....3.5 miles in hour and 18 mins. Perfect break spot and little did we know that the beard box had a water cache. Bummer. Might have liked to camp here too. We need 3 more miles to make scheduled camp tonight. Besides the gerital gang lit out prior to us at Joes and said heading there too. Shelter will be full if the take it or they might camp. We'll see.I don't like walking off extra from the trail but sometimes you have no choice like this .4 to Rutherford shelter. Water source is usually the reason so far off. G-gang was just setting up tents so we pick shelter for our beds. With tomorrow a resupply day we talk up a big morning...10x10! Get in to Unionville before noon and have lunch at Annabella pizza and roll on out. Gonna get the bunch up at 5am to make this happen. Getting to know the g-gang tonight was awesome. Papa Paul (lives at smith mtn lake) and Windward (lives in hawaii)are the bearded brothers. Looked late 60s. 2 ladies Calamity and Which way 50s and then A-Train from PA early 20s. They all fell into one another with up the trail starting points to get in front of the early crowd but have been caught up to. Also had 2 late arrivals....from none other than Blacksburg go Hokies! One worked at jimmy Johns and guessing has delivered subs to my place of work.We will be coming out of NJ tomorrow. Another state behind us. The garden state they call it. I can vouch for the lushness for sure but has been more like a rainforest. Bog walks and swamps at each turn with this lower sea level status. Snakes, frogs and newts every day. And let's not forget loads and loads of rock.Looking forward to the Pochuck board walk tomorrow. A tad blue sky peeked out just at dusk giving us some hope that leaving NJ will give us new light in NY","Brinks Road Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462625,"Up and at'em my hiking friends. It 5am and time for 10x10. A restless night for me. Was more than tired for sleep but sometimes shelter sleep just doesn't agree with me. Moisture drips from every limb and twig. Grass soaks our already wet shoes and before we even get back to the main trail my socks are soggy. Leading the pack I'm just not feeling the giddy up we had coming into the shelter last eve. I stagger to get rhythm. Little light cast odd shadows on the trail and the thick vegetation makes it hard to define the trail. Path narrows and waste to shoulder high brush soaks my clothes and arms. Dragging now in a steady shower I am spent. Legs feel like cement. My only thoughts are yet another high point I will miss litteraly. High Point monument is approaching and this damn weather is preventing any sight of the Washington Monument type structure. The highest point in NJ fades in and out with the waves of thick fog and with it goes all my spirit as I try to snap a photo of this ghost. Luckily Jim senses that I am out of my norm and takes the lead. The kids give me a pep talk as I follow in the rear. Jim has been trail tuning which adds some spunk to us. Singing out of key with ear buds in he gives us just snip its of tunes to hike by. Rock-n-roll country! Come on gang it's 10x10 wed. And we have cold beer and pizza up ahead. Thankfully the trail turns more and more forgiving allowing us to make up time and we mark our accomplishment with sticks at the road crossing. 10x10 big arms in celebration. 3.8 miles to town.Now the decision, should we stay or should we go? I announce I am staying and with that Jim gives TJ a high five and states I have just saved him 2 hours of his life in thinking he would have to talk me into it. Anna is all smiles and has her eyes on Annabells. Well swap this short day for a long one tomorrow and not loose a step.3 slices of pizza and 2 big orange sodas has me revived. Let's set up camp and take a nap. But first Anna leaves Annabells a little surprise...your killing me Smalls...blowin it up!While we check in at the town village which is right across the road from pizza place the G-gang arrives. They have the same idea. Well except for Windward who hikes like theirs a fire in his pants and bolts by saying.....tavern tavern....y'all going to the tavern? We think some wild times in his youth have set his tone for current condition. Also another hiker has arrived, Grasshopper. He recognizes me from my trail journal and says he had read my past stories to get some idea of what would lie ahead for him. He is from TN/Alabama with a thick draw. Love the south!Miss Kitty at the village gave us our free pass and directed us to our camping options. Any place within this fence and not on the play ground. We retrieve our resupply boxes from the PO right beside camp. How convenient. Nap time and then off to the tavern.Grasshopper and Windward bellied up to the bar while the other shoot pool. We find a table close to a wall outlet to charge our phones and order up. Cold brew and wings sure hit the spot. Thanks Melissa and owner for a great place to recharge ourselves. 16x16 we joke. Up by 7 and arrive by 4. Not. We want breakfast from Horlers General Store before leaving town. Maybe leave at 8 would be more realistic. We came up short on the boardwalk today so will have that to look forward to tomorrow. What seemed like a bust for a day has turns to an added highlight to this trip. You never know what the trail might bring.","Rutherford Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462665,"Back on track and ready to get the hell out of Jersey. So far rain and fog have prevented every overlook and vast view since Sunday our 1st day out. We cross into NY within 4 miles from Unionville. However bitchy we might be on this subject temps have been perfect for hiking and night time sleeping. Bugs are at bay and truthfully we are having a great adventure. Today's highlights were eating once again at Horlers store. Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a softy bagel. You want pepper ketchup? No thanks salt and pepper for this country girl. Back on the trail at 8:30 we look forward to the longest boardwalk on the trail..no not like a the beach with stores and shops but a large plank structure running a couple miles over marshlands. Not to mention all the other plank walking just to get there. Thank you trail maintainers. Making up the 5.3 we left short yesterday adds to our biggest day so far at 16.6. Rested and fortified let's getter done. The GGang got out ahead this morning and left us a message about 4 miles in..4x12. Ha we hit that mark at 10 thank you. Glad the trail helped with that, flat and less rocks, gave us the advantage. But we did have a round about way of getting 2 miles of that done. The trail made a big box turn off the road around Wallkill wildlife preserve. Yes we followed those white blazes. A yellow blazer would have had a much shorter route.Pochuck mountain was our first climb at about 700 feet in less than a mile. Seems easy enough but this state believes not in switchbacks. Go straight up and keep you momentum or you'll slide back. A short break at Pochuck Shelter to get our legs back. In the hunt for that boardwalk every road crossing had me anxious. I thought we had only come 2.5 miles by the map but knew by my legs wed done more. After some recalcs we determined we had covered 5.5 miles. Shocking. Fine with me more behind us before our lunch. We crashed on a side bench on the boardwalk with a small tree branch overhanging to provide a little shelter from the now stead mist. Righto we still in this bad weather front. Birds and frogs buzzed and burped around us hiding themselves in the tall weeds and cat tails. I'm sure had this been a full sunny day we might have been over run with Mosquitos. I'll take this trade. The GGang rolled past us on their way to Vernon. A town where the road crosses the trail and has opportunity to Heaven Hills farm a deli, garden center, ice cream and wine tasting. They plan to get a ride out for a zero day tomorrow. They wanna miss the big rain forecasted and dry out. We sectioners will take our chances a brave to storm. Clicking across the boardwalk I enjoy the last of this turkey flat trail and ready myself for the upcoming Wayanyanda mtn. With a name like that gotta be way way yanda bad. But first I think I will have some of the ice dream please.My troops are up front after me taking my many photos and are chatting the the gang at Vernon road. The gang has knocked out their bottle wine waiting on their shuttle to Antones on the Lake. Windward hollers out come on Big Dog as I cross the open farm bottom. The kids bust a gut laughing and the crowd cheers me along. After we have our ice cream at Heaven Hills the skies look more threatening. Humm can I stay on and work for stay my friends? Raspberry and butter pecan gave me the sugar pick up I needed to kick it up Wayanda. 1.6 miles worth of pure hiker hell. Wet rock steps sorta guiding us in the heart of the mtn. Push girl push. Dig those sticks in and push up with all your might to make it up and over each step. Burn out! We cussed and damned her. Sweat rolled down my face, off my eye lashes, off my nose. This has been the worse trip for me fighting fogged up glasses. The humidity and dampness paired with my heat made for troublesome sight. I'd just take my finger and rub to the inside of my glasses and keep trucking.Cheering and celebration ensued at the summit followed by a rest and medication. Vitamin I has helped with sore throbbing feet. The boys have been making fun of their women being self medicated. Hey they are too.The day is drawing late and we are feeling the miles now. Should we opt to stealth camp? My map shows shelter .4 off the trail and Jim's say .1. Big difference. Most of the thru hikers have pasted us and we know will be in this small shelter. Holds 6. Rains coming so we will have to camp. We camel up on water since nine close to this shelter and hope for the best.6:00 and we are still rolling. Jim sees the shelter sign 0.1 it is. Thank goodness. He also spots a fine camping spot for us all to be together and looks to drain well. Rain spitting we set tents and tarps and make supper. It's tall boy Thursday. I pass a little firewater around. Here's to us-section hikers from VA ready to kick Jersey to the curb.","Unionville Town Village

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462668,"Friday the 13th ya don't say. What a perfect date for the horror hike from hell. Oh I'm not complaining...oh yes I am.We slept in the rain or tried with gusts whipping up pellets of rain in waves. I tossed most of the night hoping this time drainage would be better than rattlesnake camp. They was gonna be wet enough to carry sure didn't want anything else wet.Too tired to really care I was ready to roll early to say the least. Jim listened to the radio to see what we were up against today. All along the trail we heard 90%+. Heaviest between 7-9. Rain the rest of the day. Nothing really left to do but get in as much as possible and pack up before it unloaded. Still running on yesterday's water gathered we don't plan to stop till we reach 17A and the hotdog man. The first few miles it seemed to be very doable to reach our destination only a little wet and unscavved. Oh hell no. This turned out to be a rock climbing/balancing/strength event. Now rock steps and maneuvers are one thing. This part of the trail ran over rounded rock between shrub sections tunneling you with no option for a side path for over say 2 1/2 hours. Plus did I say all while walking in a monsoon? Rain poured straight down. My cap dripped, my glasses need wipers and my feet need flippers or crampons. My toes curried in my shoes trying to get a grip on this terrane. Smalls took top award for the most falls. Tiny pants took a header and I needed at least 2 to 3 'hey give me a hand'. The bookie prize went to me when I lost my mouth piece to my platypus. We stopped at a road for a quick energy bit and I put my water hose up on my chest strap so it would fall in the mud when taking off my pack. Well went to saddle up again I must have twisted it lose and it flung way out in the road behind where we stood. Pouring rain and I'm here and can't get my water...how ironic. Well I could have but it would have been a mess to try. ""Get your shit together Thomas"" Slim Jim shouts out from the road retrieving my missing piece. 10HUT. Taking the cake for the worst trail blazing and navigation goes to NJ/NY line. The ladder should have been a warning. What is this Everest? Yep an aluminum ladder was lashed to a rock slab and blazes lead up to another ledge. Walking out to its end Jim throws up his hands in disgust. A mark slants to his right with no foot hold or grips. Yeah right I'm gonna walk sideways on a slick rock. The other option was left with tiny rock crevasses for a toe hold to possibly work our way down. Down was the other factor. Oh say 8 to 10 feet so jumping wasn't an option either.Sticks whew useless, we just tossed them below and started trying what felt best for our comfort level. Me I stop back to see who made it best and picked that way. Jim went right and barely slide off without injury. TJ and Anna went left each taking a slight different route. Oh boy my turn. I'm going without pack handing it down to the kids and take Anna's path. You'd think after this suicide mission it would be over. But no, more and more treacherous footing. Why why put the trail here? Where is Bob Peoples?Reaching the state line was anticlimactic dampened by the insistent monsoon. I had to put my camera way deep in my pack to protect it and only hope the few photos and my description here can tell what we saw. Oh and the highest point in NY had a flag flying but fogged over when we passed. A group of thru hikers commended us for being the earliest rising section hikers they had met. Hey early to get a jump on you cats and a chance for some shelter space. Luckily today most thrus are going 27 miles and will be way past out next stop.Struggling we finally reach 17A which holds for us Bellvale Creamery and the Hotdog Man. Wow 10 miles down and only 2 to go and it's only noon. TJ and I both have hiker hobble walking up the road. Jim on the other hand was almost in a skip. 2 dogs, drink and chips $5.50 PERFECT! Jim get the special twice and Anna gets her own special. Dog bun, no weinie pls just condiments. Still refraining for sodas and meat she does the best she can with what is served. Oh and did I mention the sun, the wonderful sun? It came out and warmed us to a burn. Other hikers are eating as well. Santa,Prom Queen and Trail Wife from Maine. A bus rolls by and another hiker approaches. Is that Moose ? Sure enough. Can't be certain where he will appear. On to the creamery for some dessert. I'm stuffed and only have bites of what others ordered. A spikit on the building allows us easy reload. I'm ready for a nap and dry out and head on back to the trail. Anna joins me while the boys finish ice cream and Jim charges his phone.Sun warms the woods and casts shadows for the first time since Sunday. I can't believe this I the same day. Crossing yet another rock area Anna lead s the way. Scampering up and over the Eastern Pinnacles. Nice but I still don't like this approach to straight up rock climbing with a pack on my back. One miss step and your flat of your back falling down quite the distance. Up next Cat Rocks. Pack comes off and I barely make it down this one in a twisted mess. If a blue blaze option comes up I will be taking it. My legs are shot. Trail animals today...a snake on pinnacles which Anna ran up on and then she spotted the smallest little turtle in the trail. She moved him for his safety. Sun still out as we roll into Wildcat Shelter. Hang up gear to dry and work on our feet and rest. The boys arrive and do the same. We have the place to ourselves. Close to dusk one last passing thunderstorm to cap off the day. And then a thru hiker arrives. Sunbeam from Minnasota. What a great personality. He always tents if he can and has no stove. Quite cooking because too tired after long days. Only eats junk food and buys sodas when he can along the way. We visit for awhile and turn in when the peep frogs turn up their voices.","Wawayanda Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462675,"Wow what a good nights sleep I had. I didn't stir till almost 6am. We all agreed to rollout of bed at 7 and be ready to hit the trail at 8. I slept so hard my throat was sore from snoring. Hope you guys didn't stay awake on my account?My water was low so I gathered up a little early and went on back down to the water source we crossed last eve to reload. It was the first real mountain like run off that I had seen on this trip. All other quote springs are either pond run off or low land black water. The ground up here has so much iron the water has a rusty dinge to it. Tastes ok after treatment but looks like cat water we called it.Clear beautiful day. Blue bird skies and lush forest surrounds us. I feel the best of this trip. Cooker hiker from back home said today would be our toughest with all the elevation changes. Leg burn out. I can't imagine it being harder than last but well see.Charging up each climb we hope for no more rock walking ridges. Fitzgerald Falls provided a nice change. 2 tall falls cascading side by side from above. Smalls takes the opportunity to wash her hair with a little assistance from Tiny Pants. A good man, better hang on to this one Anna. Time for up and down, up and down, over 14 miles. We set goals of shorter sections to hike to in hopes of helping our motivation and progress . Technical rock climbing sucks, especially with a pack. Mine is a tad larger than the others and is starting to really take its toll on this old women. Feet and leg strength can only take so much. Pushing my body up using my sticks helps but again arm strength will only so so far as well. Hoping for a grand view off Mombasha High Point turned uneventful. We couldn't tell if we were at the top. Can't see over these trees. Water magic was at most major road crossing today. This section has little sources and a trail group and a local have been so kind to leave gallon jugs for reloading. A Sobo warned us of this and said be sure to resupply. Another set of hikers met us climbing one of the many ups. Section hikers too and packed for only a few days out. 2 seasoned gentleman who as we walked away asked if I was thur hiking and then if I was Lead dog. Hey yea I follow you on Trail Journals. You started in 2009. Yep that's me guys. I smiled so I forgot how hard the rest of that hill was.NY 17 was the hardest descent I've seen in some time. Losing 500 feet in less than 1/4 mile. Knees creeped and sticks bent trying to ease down this thing. Entering now Harriman State Park we take a nap at a parking area in the grass and people watch while we cool off. We stink something awful at this point. Been 7 days with out real shower and the fermenting it almost peek. Tomorrow is town day and hotel thank goodness. I scan the lot for potential magic. Water cold drink anything. May oriental folks apparently find this a location of choice. They are being shuttle in by bus and they arrive and go by car too. Picking plants and buzzing around like little bees. What's that he is carrying? Watermelon, oh dear God help me here. A slice of tasty water sure would be good. My mouth waters as I put on my trail shirt and hat back on to look as best as I can. Hahaha. Let's turn up the southern charm. A group of 5 have cut a big melon and slices lay. Say miss, you share as I gesture hand to mouth? Ahh yes ahh yes she says. I hold up 4 fingers to cover me and my hiking buds and she gathers 4 slices for me to take. Yogi #1. Yogi is a term used on the trail when you ask for something you do not have. 4.3 miles left to Fingerboard. We contemplate going a little farther to make town tomorrow a little earlier in the day. But after more ups and down we haven't to energy. Agonies grind up from 17 went on forever. Again no switchbacks. I started making my own by darting from one side of the trail to the other to alleviate lower calf strain. TJ was feeling froggy and busting right up this with Anna close behind.Harriman park by far is the most beautiful. A large lake ran all along one side. Camping and nice overlooks to its edges. A very open feel even though tall trees surrounded us. I think it was due to not having any under growth. Just bright green thick grass. If it had been mowed would have looked like a yard. Getting my second wind it's time to see this states version of the lemon squeeze. This usually mean a tight rock crevasse you must pass threw. This one help true to that. Anna goes first but her bed roll wedges on both sides and even with her drive stops her. Pack must come off and handed up. Thank you TJ. Jim takes his roll off this pack and squeezes by. Big Lead Dog is up next. I don't even attempt with y pack and hand up to Jim above. He'll my arss can barley fit thru here wide side. One more rock scrabble with blazes painted right up a rock wall. I'm out. This is ridiculous. A blue blaze side route is my option.Evening sun helped the numerous mountain laurels to finally pop bloom. More day hikers around now coming in to camp for the weekend. Soon we at a ridge loaded with tents and people. My eyes are so set on blazes and looking for the shelter I almost overlooked the large sign with all the upcoming and past destinations. Heck we are here. A family was coming from the shelter and had decided it was full and didn't want to stay there. Cool that would be good for us. He says no water there and I ask if he has plenty to share and he offers me a nice cool liter. Yogi#2A father and son have taken up residence which leaves just enough room for our 4.Perfect since tenting was going to be sparse as a group together. Besides again we want an early start on town tomorrow. The less to pack up the better.Fingerboard, one of the 1st shelters built along the AT, circa 1934. Bet Earl Schaffer slept here, 1st thru hiker. This 3 sided rock hut with 2 fire places on each end was quite historic. Very low ceiling and plank board bed setting right on a rock slab. You looked right out the front over the so called valley below. They have no farm valley views like home just deep gaps of forest.A cool evening has us retreating inside out of the wind. Sunbear comes in and pitches his tent out back and the pen Texaco makes a stop by. He had come off the trail to surprise his mom in PA and has walked 'only' 17 miles this eve and wants to get a few more in before dark. Lights out. Can't wait for that shower, pizza and heated pool again tomorrow. I most likely will just sink.","Wildcat Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462684,"Up with the chickens again.. The super moon spot lighted our shelter at 2:20am. I thought a hiker was coming in with his head lamp it was so bright. Shoot sunrise here is at 5:15 and set very late like 9:30 so really long days. They are about to catch up with me too. I've been fight head congestion which has move to my chest so that I sound like a smoker when I cough. Tiresome but I'm pushing threw it with the help of my hiking companions. Jim burned the way out of camp. Nothing between him and town but a smooth 13.4 miles. Still in the park the beauty follows us off. More blooms and thick sections of shrubs the trail passes thru. Fairly easy walking. Glad this terrane is more forgiving without those monster 900 foot climbs and descents. Only have 2 of those today. Black mountain and climb to West mtn Shelter. We won't actually see that shelter as it is .6 off the trail and has a view of NYC skyline.8 miles in we gotta reload food fuel and take a rest. We have been going pretty hard. I am about too tire to eat and Jim surely is. He has curled up on the rock overlook in a small shady spot. It was a grand view. One of our best. We could see the Hudson River, Bear mtn tower and town. Oh yes town. We should be there in an hour or so. 2:30 is our target.Very hot and muggy now. The only water between there and now is what we have on our backs. I drink what is left in my side liter with lunch and only hope what is in my platypus will last to the end. Rested Big Lead dog is back in front. It's been hard for me to keep that spot for long. between hitting the wall with energy and my pack dragging me down I've decided an new set of gear will be on my back come next trip. Ultralight baby. This old girl can't lug it any more over this many days.Bear mtn tower here we come. What's this Anna a paved road. She and I both are elated. A fellow tells us it isn't too bad and steps are approaching. TJ takes the lead here and begins are arduous journey up the uncountable rock steps. The trail rounds and rounds the mountain side. More and more people now which means a road got them here from someplace. Hot as hell too. Full sun beats on us. Hope my water holds. A group of foreign guys check their map and ask for direction. Hey for water you got a trade. Hey I joke but really you got extra water? Taking these decongestant pills has me parched. A trade is made and we are all on our way. Yogi#3Jim spot what looking like a vending machine as we crest the mtn. The trail has turned to a wide sidewalk almost. A building, yes vending. Gatorade saved our lives! The tower is swarming with people. A road leads right to it. Motorcycles and cars line the way. Not the place we want to stay long that's for sure. A quick photo op and look off to the city skyline we bust off of here. Jim and Anna begin counting steps down. Count is lost at 250 steps not more than a quarter of the way down. Blazes and people are all that is on my mind. Get around the people and follow them blazes to town girl. We pop out at an inlet of the Hudson. Eclectic groups have formed on every picnic table cooking out. Hundred of them. One big Father's Day party. Where's the blazes? We wonder around a bit and have no guidance from those there. AT what is that?Once found we need to make our way to the intersection heading for our hotel in Fort Montgomery. Hot and hotter on the pavement. Anna takes charge with the map to get us pointed in the right direction . This highway crossing is going to be a suicide trap. I spot a guy in an SUV pulling from a side street. That will haul us and gear I thought. I run over to ask if he knew where hotel was and before he could answer my group has darted across the round about and is in the middle medin. Oh I gotta go mister....Seeing our duress he pulls over right in line of traffic and says jump in. Yogi#4. Trail magic. Thank you Lord. Cars flying past us we through packs, sticks and bodies in and are whisked away. Yoni you saved us. The drive was way more than 1.6 miles. We all vote now way we walk this back tomorrow...TAXI!!!First thinks first shower...Anna gets dibs says long air need more time to dry. Ok sure. But don't flood the bathroom floor next time...your killin me Smalls. Pizza and beer for starts. Laundry and nap. Next up Fresh Market for supper after some heated pool and sauna time. Lovely. We watched the basketball finals in the lobby with a group of army vets in for a wounded warrior project at West Point just up the road. What a great way to end our night sharing fun and friendship.","Fingerboard Shelter

I do admit a zero would have been nice but us section hikers haven't the time for that. Gotta get those miles in will vacation days still last and get back to work to make money to do it all over again.Jim said last night he was going down at 6 for first breakfast and then again before they closed at 10. Me, I'm ready for a little more sleep in and then that one last shower before food. We all ate in shifts getting in what town had to offer for each of us. Taxi has been called and we are to depart at 10:15.Waiting our on the hotel lawn we see a hiker approaching from the gas station close by. Long brown legs, blue on blue. Is that Grasshopper? And is he even wearing shorts? Hey man we holler out. He has walked the distance from the zoo up here and going to get his resupply box inside. Perfect he will have first dibs on the items we had extra from our resupply and frig. Beers and cokes. Coming out he has 4 boxes, our 2 and his. What a spread. He says he'll not even need to go to the store after all and pops the first beer to cool down. We offered him our taxi but too early for him to get ready so gave him the number. He'll probably walk it back. No big deal for the hooper. Dropped off at Bear Mtn Inn we retrace our blazes and head down into the zoo. The Trailside Zoo And Museum is free to us. Actually think it was to all that ewe walking in. Small but Nice we saw its animals and a bear. Not as exciting as our wild sighting for sure.Heading out of town we walk right over the Hudson River. The bridge was spectacular and had a giant American flag hanging from it rafters. Sorry to say we heard an old man drove up last night, got out of his car and jumped. Police boat was out searching and cops stood on the bridge as we passed by. The kiddos jumped out in front leaving the road walk. All exits are up out of any town. Jim and I watch them disappear as this heat is welling up in my face. More rock steps at first and I'm moving like molasses. Luckily the trail turns the the left and out the side hill, nice. A well maintained path and a beautiful day. All is good. Rolling over of ridges and almost no rocks I feel like I'm back at home. I only wish I felt as good as this trail is. My congestion is full on and breathing is quite the struggle. Getting a later start was nice for the rest but has put us in the heat of the day. We take breaks to cool and catch us all back up together. 8 miles down. New have 15.3 total but not really worried about the time it will take as we will be tenting for sure at a camping area. No reservation required. As the day progresses the trail is even better and so am I. I take out first on each stop to get a run on the bunch knowing they will pass me. But they'll have to work for it. I don't give up easily. Jim really wants to see the friars at Graymoor Spiritual Center so we take a side trip. We need water as well. None really in front of us after this stop. No men of the clothe were spots but we did take a quick tour of the grounds. A feeling of peace and history as I walked through. Large steeples and stained glass, candle light shrines, and blessed water. Thank you God for providing. Clocking more miles evening draw in and the kids have put some distance between us old dudes. They always stop at road crossing but these last few miles have none so guess well see them at Dennytown road. Milo is expected this eve. We plan to meet him about 7:30. We thought we set this time with a good 30 minutes to spare but we are moving a little slow over these rocky turns. Not really hard hiking just wear and tear of the day. Wonder what he'll bring? Can't wait.The clock struck the half hour and we hear voices...it's Anna. We are here Jim. Milo greets us with a cold water. Much needed, Jim is out. Also he had some NY brews which hit the spot. We go on in to the sites and gather on a picnic table. If he had not come I do believe I would have set up my tent and went right to sleep. Still so tired. Burning Boots and Thirsty arrive. Milo offers them a drink as well and we catch up on what our lives have been since we hiked together last year in Connecticut. What a small world. Already we talk up what section will be next. Massachusetts And Vermont, hope Milo can join us. Thanks man for some great trail magic!","Holiday Inn Express- Bear Mtn-Fort Montgomery

Warm and muggy we roll out early trying to make some extra miles today to shorten tomorrow's final walk out. Seems to be the theme of this trip but has really worked out for us all. Long day begets a short day and rest. Always nice.Getting my legs warmed up as the sun begins to break through I feel again as if I'm walking at home. A good feeling. Sun filled woods, shadows and blooms. More trail maintenance that takes us side hill and avoids all those rock bars. Thank you thank you! Four miles here and four miles there and before we know it RPH shelter turn appears. Anna and I have been talking since early morning that we'd like a cold drink and would get one even if it meant ordering pizza to the shelter. Yes it is located close to a road and pizza place does deliver to it. But what is this, a note, trail magic 6/16, 6/17, 6/18. I quickly look at my watch and say oh hell yeeeAaahhh. Grrrrrs Wayside offered hotdogs, drinks, candy, chips and ice cream. What a perfect setting too. This cinder block building has bunks, desk and small library and a pass thru to a covered patio with picnic table. I spy my spot of rest, a lawn chair and stool in the sun out back. We had already decided to hump it here by noon and take a long respite from this heat. Start back hiking say 4,4:30. This magic added a special twist to it all. 2 hotdogs and a root beer. I need the nap.Grasshopper comes in a little later after getting his phone repaired in town. Burning boots, thirsty and Sunbear are here too. Everyone waits out the heat and enjoys the story's Grrr tells us. He lives in CT and was going yo SOBO but his knee went out so now this retired Army vet shares his magic till surgery time.Loading our water one last time from the hand pump here, treat that first though, it's time to hike. Grasshopper has informed us a store awaits at Stormville and will give us those extra miles we need today. We can stealth and go for food and drink. In his TN draw...y'all sell beer? Click. Let's go...I take out with Hopper to get this first big climb out of the way. Knowing he will do all the talking I can use that as a distraction. He is a strong hiker and I'm sure was lagging so not to run off and leave me. Scanning his pack size I'm asking questions about gear and hiking tips. 3 miles fly by. 2 to go. The boys find us a nice area to stealth so we girls get camp set up while they go up the road to the station. Had they'd known we'd all just camped by the store. The owner said it would have been ok. Mowed grass area, outlet to charge phone, water And of course the store. Only expecting a slice of pizza, beer and a Gatorade Jim surprises us with a full pie. Yes. No cooking tonight. I cooked last night late and only did so for my own good, wasn't even hungry. Too tired. But tonight we celebrate. It's our last night out and what better way to do so than with our new friend Grasshopper. It was all I had dreamed of. The trail goes on for ever and the party never ends.","Dennytown Camp

Grasshopper says his goodbyes and we wish him well on the rest of his journey. Slow and steady I lead us out of stealth camp and up our first little climb. A cooler morning and I do believe the threat of rai. Has passed. Wow the trail is being so good to me. Less elevation change, gradual grades and no rock scrabbled. Jim is the one feeling all the pains this morning. Aches and joints. Get those tunes on Jim and march us out of here. Making quick time we come to a shelter the rest hiked on to and get our water for the remainder of the day. TJ makes his last cup of coffee from his airo press. Smells great and others sniff close. 5 miles and well stop for lunch at Nuclear Lake. I've heard it really pretty so thought it would be a nice last lunch venue.Easy woods walking in the fresh morning air makes me wish this trip wasn't ending. However I would be lying if I said I wasn't ready for a break from hiking. Burning boots dives into the open waters, Thirsty rests in the shade. Anna and I see a rock area we can set on and dip our feet in this Nuclear Lake. Jim crashes not even wanting to eat while TJ eats the last of the peanut butter etc. This place got its name from a plutonium plant that exploded and spread toxic dust all over the area. Once off limits it is now a highly visited scenic loop hike which the AT boards. As Boots said it ""hope it gives me super powers"". I soaked my feet and they feel lightening fast now! Shoot it is the clearest water we have seen in 11 days. Now to climb West Mtn. Over the next few miles and then we will descent to West Dover Road the finish line. Plugged in Jim is town ready. Man he gets those legs turning. I lag back and take these last few miles all in. The last mountain was much easier than all the rest. Trail helped but also I think we are much stronger and full of adrenalin. One last rock scramble prior to the sound of cars on the road. Visions of that big tree I see. Yeehooo we did it. We are here. We just walked 152 miles. Our thru hiking friend congratulate us. The Dover Oak towers over us with his massive limbs reaching all the way across the road. It looks so much bigger with all it's leaves. Jim calls for our taxi ride while TJ and I gather twigs to leave our mark along the road...VA GANG. That says it all. The G-gang will know it is us.

Tori at the B&B greeted us with open arms and showed us to our rooms for shower and change. Oh did that feel sooo good. Even with bathing just a few days ago a nice shower in a home is much more than what a hotel can offer.We relaxed in the parlor watching the World Cup Soccer playoffs sipping on brews they offered and some of what TJ conjured up. Still tired we thought about ordering in but got the gumption to walk down to the local tavern. Good choice it was right up our alley. Nachos, burgers and fries. Yumm. They even had a hiker sign-in book that went back to 1992.Today we roll out for home but not without a fine breakfast from this fine establishment. Co-owners Barbara and Deborah layed out a spectacular display of food. Fruit smoothies, dessert bowls, eggs, sausage, cresants. Oh and the monkey bread. Wish we'd gotten the remainder to go.

I knew the temps would be 10 degrees colder at the top of Salt Pond Mountain but still it was a surprise. My breath fogged in the air as we walked back behind the lodge on the red blazed trail for Bald Knob. Larry picked our location and hike today. Two of the best overlooks on the whole mountain, Bald Knob and Bear Cliffs. We made a circuit hike out of them getting maybe 4 miles in, a good start to the season and a little warm up to our trip this Wednesday to Harpers Ferry. Good thing we had to cut it short up here today for another commitment or I’d had him covering this whole mountain top. Wink Wink!Leaves littered the trail but most had not turned yet. Climbing the ½ mile to this summit got the ol legs working and the heart pumping. Warming up was nice as the cold settled on my naked legs. Still shorts season for me. Bundle up the top and put on gloves if ya have to…and yes that’s what we did. Larry even had his bogen on. Here’s why we came, looking out from the rock ledges of the knob. Views for miles with this blue sky day. We didn’t stop long as to keep our warmth up. I was in and out of my fleece at least 7 times. Sandra would have been proud. Winding off by way of the fire road we connected to Bear Cliffs trail, a less traveled path. Love it. We only saw one couple and they said the same about us. However the parking lot was partially full when we arrived and more so when we left. Glad folks are coming up here to keep this facility going. Anyways we hiked out the 2 mile trail enjoying nature and our conversation. Larry did seem quite for a bit when the path turned down slightly knowing he’d have to return up. “I didn’t think it was this far out” he stated on several occasions. He kept thinking the “connector sign” was the actual miles out this path (.25 miles) NOT 1.9 baby. Gotcha!!Woo big fella here’s our turn to Bear Cliffs. He as in the lead and almost past it. Turns out the old path is not used much and they have re-routed the side trail to avoid some rock ledges to navigate along. Needless to say it was great to be back here. Full sun kept us warm in this cozy tree protected area from the fall winds. Tree foliage has just about hindered the views from the cliffs though. Needs some housekeeping up here.Lunch and map reading with a tad of resting on the L-Trains part and our day was coming to an end. We have to get back. We take the return walk back and hit the connector down to another trail. North winds about chill us again along with more leaf cover blocking out the sun.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476353,"Coming off a day of following the Civil War’s campaign thru Shepherdstown WV and the battlefield of Antietam and its ‘sunken bloody road’ I was feeling like Johnny Reb marching home when I finally set foot on South Mountain. Here I was ready to walk on new ground, following the white blazes thru part of Maryland back to south Harpers Ferry.Larry and I were dropped off at 9:30 after leaving our car at Crampton Gap. We’ll walk south back to it. Laura from the Outfitters of Harpers Ferry helped with our shuttles and has informed us the store is up for sale but she still plans to keep her little shop down on the main drag open. I sure will miss the big store with the small water fall running thru it and their services. We can still plan to see her at Trail Day though.Here we stand, the L-Train ready to depart and Lead Dog ready to run, in the mist and threat of rain. We have already talked if we walk fast enough we may our run it.We have a little back tracking to do as I want to see the ‘first’ Washington Monument erected by the folks of Maryland in honor of George Washington. A large bottle shaped rock tower also used by the troops during the civil war as a look out area. Cold air cuts thru me. Damp it is and somewhat eerie feeling for some reason. Sure glad Larry is with me ‘cause I want to go up in this thing to see out. A spiral staircase, tight and dark leads me up after a few turns around and around to the top. I look out like a bird peeping out of its nest to see over the walls. Heavy skies cut the view.Larry leads us off the observatory and back to the AT, south bound we go passing various other ruins of the 1800s and many civil war markers to tell us what battle or troop movement happened at each location. Turners Gap, Fox Gap and Crampton Gap all where locations the confederates took higher ground to trap and target the Union soldiers unfamiliar with the terrain. I was sure glad these gaps where with not much elevation drop nor gain. Made for some gooood walkin for me and the L-Train. Shoot before we knew it we had covered nearly 6 miles and coming up on our scheduled lunch stop, White Rocks Cliff. I had hoped for a nice sunny spot for a break and lunch but not today. Cool, cloudy and clammy. Hey but still no rain. Heck we were in shorts and tees by this point. Onward Larry orders, get that arss moving private. Yes sir General Iron Pants. He has now derived a plan that I could just walk on into Harpers Ferry today blowing out tomorrows other 10 miles and he’d pick me up at the Potomac. Humm I do ponder the idea and I do have rashens to make the trip since we aren’t stopping for lunch. Do I try it? Rain supposed to hit 90% by 4:00, a good 70% by 2:00. Ahh I guess I’ll save it so you can hike with me Larry. A sigh is heard behind me…With no views from our highest climb of the day a mere 600 feet we grab another gear and cruise on over the next 3 miles arriving at Crampton Gap before 2:00. Our civil war tour isn’t over just yet. We have the War Correspondents Memorial to check out. It’s right here beside our car at the gap, built by George A Townsend, pen name GATH, in honor to all the war journals then, now and forever. This 50 foot high and 40 foot wide arch is quite the feature. Not to mention all the rest of his estate that was once here. He donated his arch to the Federal Govt so guess what, they maintain it. And that my friend is the end to day 1 across South Mountain. Johnny Reb and General Iron Pants are off to follow another white blaze called Honey Cream Ale…..","Washington Monument

Steady rain came over night and has yet to totally leave us this morning. Fog socks the mountain tops as we leave from the Econo Lodge to take our shuttle back to Crampton Gap. Yes I could have walked these miles today by myself and he’d pick me up at the river but this ol man is standing by his woman and saddling up for another 10 mile day.Laura drops us off at Gathland State Park aka Crampton Gap. Yes GATH had a park named for him and that arch I was talking to you about. It’s the only thing standing out here this morning in the heavy fog. Two of his small buildings have been refurbished to house a civil war museum holding artifacts found on South Mountain and a place for his history, writings and works. Humm we might as well tour these while we wait out the rest of the showers to move on. Sure enough an hour delay has given us yet another day to walk without a drop of rain hitting us. Only the trickle of water falling from the leaves do we see. Working to get his legs loose Larry trudges along behind me for the first mile or so. Just barely in talking distance range so I slow my pace till he catches up several time over. A nice wide path leads us through the moody woods in sights of the Ed Garvey Shelter sign. That will put us 4 miles in.An image moves between the trees up ahead on the trail. Short in stature, four legged I believe. Is it a dog? No it’s a goat. I see a black beard. Long shaggy hair hangs from its legs turning sideways it moves off into the woods a bit. It’s a horse Larry says. No No too little for that. Pony maybe but no horse. Sure enough he stops for a bite of leaves and stares as do we. A big wide white stripe covers his middle around his body like a band. I snap a few photos thru the fog which adds to this amazement. Billy Goat Gruff is real!Just over the slope we arrive at the shelter and check our map. We have come across a few trail runners already so we can’t be far from the other end of our trek. 2 miles left till lunch, Weverton Cliffs. I am looking forward to seeing out and sure hope we can.Feet feel good, legs feel good. Larry’s getting his second wind too but is ready for a break even if he thinks not. Cliff trail sign but no mileage to the overlook. Can’t be far I say, turns out only 0.1 but all down. The Shenandoah River runs below us and we can see over to Harpers Ferry 4 miles away. Train Train, the sound fills the valley as it runs past while we eat. Felt good to set down for a bit for a bite. Just long enough to get stiff. Sorry Larry. We just had come over our first real rocky section and elevation change and now we have a mile left of down before the trail turns to flat.Passing more weekend hikers and a few backpacking groups we reach the C&O Canal. What an expressway, flat baby flat. Larry was ready to pay up to $30 for a bike to expedite the trip. The feet are now sore and he has hiker hobble. Bikers, runners and walkers about. Calmness surrounds us on this path back town. We take a more leisurely pace putting up our hiking sticks in exchange for holding hands. Nice for a change on the trail. I don’t think I’ll get this same treatment from another. Grinning from ear to ear once the Potomac Bridge is in sight Larry picks up the pace. Not much but a little.

Well let’s just say it can go. Sometimes steady and easy gets the job done.Larry and I head up to the three-way above Woods Hole to get our hike on. I’ve given a little slack for some extra morning sleep time. With this in mind I know we’ve gotta do some quick steppin to make it off the trail by 2:00. I got a party to attend. Happy Birthday Judy Judy Judy!Wind cuts thru the road crossings while we get our packs on. We add a jacket to help knock out the chill and head south into the woods. I don’t foresee running into a sole at this location. Most day hikers will be the most scenic overlooks and the parkway due to leaf season. Noticing Larry doesn’t quite have that pick up in his step from last week’s boulevard path I drop back a gear and slow it down. He looked over the profile last night to give the final say so on this hike. Didn’t look that bad and had a nice section of no elevation gain, so he determined. Well we all know the maps don’t lie only I do. Ha Ha. Explaining that there would be ups and downs and more trail like features on this trek verses Maryland he consented. We do have a fire road walk but that isn’t till a couple miles in and that was just about the time he was ready to cash in his chips and look for an out.Now the only option there would be well that road we just walked over at Big Horse Gap. Oh I forgot about that access point. I really did. His eyes shooting bullets as we walked across it just 15 minutes ago. We are now about an hour and half in the hike and oh about 2.5 miles in give or take. We have another 2 miles or so out to the overlook of Sugar Run. I really wanna go there but the L-Train has other notions. Ball Deep or Die says the North Bound White Blaze. Yep a hiker must have marked this up when hiking in some ass deep snow. Larry takes this as his sign to about face and start hiking north back to the car. Besides cold beer awaits there and a radio. Kickoff is in an hour. I on the other hand am calculating my race out to the overlook and back. 11:33 now, Can I make it to there and back in an hour? I look at the map..hummm looks like more than 2 miles but I now the terrain is fire road with a few slight ups. I’m going for it. After giving Larry his lunch and a good bye kiss I’m off and running. Well just fast hiking. My sticks clicking in metronome time. Glancing to my right and left I see the trees pass by faster and faster. I haven’t tried to walk this fast since it was the 10X10 day in NY. This is much easier with my day pack let me tell ya. Even Texaco came to mind and how he pushed his pace in Maine for Pete sakes, walking at nearly 3 miles an hour in crazy rock and rooted sections with mountains in between. You go Marathon man, this hiker chick is doing all she’s got and feeling pretty good I might add. Leaves cover the forest floor and those remaining on the trees rustle loud with the gusts of wind. No sunshine today. Cloudy above but I’m plenty warm. My strides going as far as they can, darting between what few rocks are in my way. I know I am closing in on the overlook and hear voices. It’s a group of about 20 fellas lugging up this grade loaded with big packs. Say you guys stay at Wapiti last night? As I move on past then one by one. Yes they say turning to watch me disappear around the next corner. Ha don’t worry fellas I’ll be seeing you shortly when I pass you on my return I think to myself. Seeing the greenery of rhodies just on the ridge line to my left I know that overlook is only yards away. Keeping my pace on the turn up the hill off the fire-road I check my watch for time, 12:16.Perfect.Scanning the valley taking in a quick inventory of the leaves I then set up my snap shot to prove I was here. No time to eat I’m on a mission. Guzzling down some Gatorade it’s time to run down them boys. My mind races along with my feet over return trip. Push it push it push it. I love racing with myself, I always win! One last turn and I see the back foursome of the pack. Hey didn’t you just pass us the leader says? Yep that was me. They are from central Florida and here for a VA section hike. Come this way each year. Way cool guys. I notice the little fella has a Florida State tee shirt on. We chat only a few minutes me telling them how far to Wood Hole road, Docs Knob their destination. They plan to hike out into Pearisburg tomorrow. Have a great trip guys and glad to have you here in VA. Speeding on up the hill to my turn off where I left Larry the rest of the group has gathered for lunch. You see our buddy’s they ask? Yep 10 to 15 minutes behind me but I’m double timing fellas. You go girl! A voice hollers out as I vanish in the trees. So here I am having hiked 4 miles in 1 hour and 39 minutes and now making time on my last wooded section hoping to be at the truck by 2:00. I got an hour so let’s do it!Smiling to myself I am already thinking trail magic. Gotta leave them some goodies. Speaking of which hope Larry has left me some goodies at the truck I’m just about to get hungry. Rock hopping and side hilling I’m only hitting the high spots in the trail. Oh and here is where we met 2 Liter and Fabio. I know the exact spot they came hiking toward us and we talked and she talked. Yes SHE talked. And then there was the time Dad, Janet and I hiked this stretch all the way to Wapiti AND BACK! Yes we did, in the snow! When we came out the woods that day Janet said she was so tired her legs were coming off at the hinges. What great memories. Flashbacks turn present and I’m walking out of the woods onto Miss Tilly’s Road with 5 minutes to spare, 1:55. Record time baby, 2.5 miles in 46 minutes and that’s not on any fire road. Quickly I get my trail magic note ready while Larry tapes a blowpop to a bottle of water for my little Florida State fella.

Yep Larry bought me a new ULA backpack and it’s PURPLE too. Jim and I planned this overnight hike around my shopping spree at Mount Rogers Outfitters in Damascus.I rolled into the store to meet Tom Davenport the best outfitter in town and all around. He had my new special ordered pack laying out for me to see when I walked in the door. I had big red over my shoulder loaded for the trip. Tom looked at it and said HUMMM and I looked at the table and said HUMMM. Our minds began to race wondering if all of this was gonna fit in little of that. Stuff sacs of this and that scattered the outfitters floor like me opening all my Christmas presents at once. I couldn’t wait to prove I could make it work. Tom took his time and carefully placing each item in my new pack to make sure it would be loaded properly and carry well. Shit shove it in there Tom it will fit I was thinking to myself. He had just weighed big red before I dumped her load, 25lbs even the scale read. Room was running out and he went to the side pockets and mesh pockets on the outside. I strapped in, she felt good. Walking around the store like a proud mamma with her kid on her back, Tom went to the rack looking for options. We tried on some other versions on ULA, more room here and more room there, more weight too. We loaded and unloaded. I’ve got to make it work, no way I’m coming out of this store without lightening my load. It was time for a decision. 2 hours later I had Pretty in Purple packed to my perfection. Tom stepped back and let me go at it. Listening to his packing advice and some of my own preferences I was loaded for the final weigh in and comfort test. My eyes bugged out when I saw the scale arrow say 20lbs. HOT DIGITY DOG. SOLD! Tom was a relieved as I to hear those words. He had worked hard for his money today.

I was meeting Jim at our finish point first so we could leave my car there, Dennis Cove Road. Rolling into the parking area I was surprised how full it was at 1:00 and more cars coming in Jim included. We had a late lunch and get our gear transferred from car to car for the trip. Buddy coonhound yodeled as we drove around and around the curvy TN mountain roads. Arriving at Wilber Dam parking spots we left a trail magic cooler of drinks for the SOBOs and whomever else might find the need to quench their thirst. 2:00 let’s get hiking.My new pack felt great as I pranced off into the woods following Jimbo, Buddy leading our way. He was ready to stretch his legs and inhale the forest floor. A nicely graded trail lead us very soon to Watauga dam. Little did we know our view over this massive lake and up to the crest of the far ridge would be our location in a few more hours.Warm summer like sun soothed over me. It felt good to be back out for an overnight. My new pack was riding fine on the hips and shoulders. Shoot 5 pounds less it’s got to feel better. Signs have been posted along our way warning of bear activity and two shelter closing do to them. Guess they have found a good food source and have set up home. Glad we didn’t plan to shelter this trip. Just before coming to the first road crossing of 321, Shook Branch, a couple tells us they spotted of a bear just a few minutes ago. Noticeably nervous the lady was ready to about face and go back to the car. We on the other hand will just have to keep walking and see what we see.Taking a break at the little road side park we access our water situation. Jim has packed 2 cokes and two 32 ounce powerades on our good friend Buddy Coonhound. Gotta love ya some Buddy. We both camel up on the power drinks and reload from a water spickit. If my plan to attain water from the campsite source is a bust we’ll have back up. Up we go for the one and only real elevation gain of this trip, 2000 feet. I have moved to the front of the pack on this section. 6:30 is my target for camp. Feeling pretty good I take a steady pace with no plans on stopping. My pack still rides good and what a difference a few pounds make. Thank you Tom and ULA.Oh and another note of thanks to Bob Peoples. Nobody builds better trail. Nice long switchbacks with like a 5% grade makes our walk up Pond Mtn a dream. Hey look Jim we were just down there. A perfect gap in the colorful leaf canopy opens up to a view over Watagua Lake and the dam we walked across. Cresting Pond we keep our eyes peeled for that campsite and water source. I’ve camped here twice and know we have to walk across it before camp. Passing one fire ring Jim gets a little skeptical that any water will be found. Just to dry and we haven’t walked across a single stream the whole way up here. I have the faith, it will be, even but a trickle I say.There a green patch of rhodies it’s got to be in there Jim says. I spot a nice pool for dipping as we cross in the rocks that usually flow over with this mountain spring. Camp is just up ahead I say. One hour before dark, 6:30, yes, let’s pitch that tent, get water for Buddy and start a fire. Well I’m the only tent pitcher tonight. Jimbo and Buddy will sleep under the stars. It’s cowboy style for them setting up close the fire.Darkness falls along with random leaves ending their season. Our fire lights up Pond Mtn and conversation fells the air.

Just tired enough to drift on off while listening to some tunes but then once I cut the sound man it’s windy out there. We noticed before turning in that the tree tops rustled loudly with gusts rolling over the mountain but we didn’t feel it. Only my mind could imagine what was blowing around between me and my tent walls. Jim and Buddy on the other hand lay out on the ground beginning to slowly cover with falling leaves. We all slept well with only a few night light flashes with trips to a tree and a jingle jingle of a doggy collar.Morning light was hindered with a slight fog. Guessing that was from the lake and surrounding water lets way below us pushing dampness up the mountain. Just enough chill to keep me in my coat while packing up. Taking our time and eating a warm breakfast for a change we didn’t roll out till 9:20. Yep that’s a first boys and girls. Lead dog is getting soft in her old age.Yellows and golds popped with color in the haze as we walked across the remaining ridge. I’d say peak for these leaves. Good old Bob Peoples treated our knees and legs with care once we made the turn down Pond. He has re-routed this once tricky steep section to smooth long switchbacks. Before we know it we’ve come down 1000 feet and in even more color, reds and greens, just spectacular. The trail narrows now to wind along the south side and in ear shot of Laurel Creek. Sunshine warms us up so we have to shed some layers and let Buddy get a drink just under a nice big foot bridge. A train of kids come by with a pack leader heading for the Falls. Seems just like The Cascades at home now. Only a mile or so to get there. We let them pass and follow in shortly after.Winding thru the greenery and along the creek itself we run into a family of 4. They have traveled up toward the Falls but didn’t quite make it not knowing if they’d gone far enough or missed a turn. Recalling the best I could from previous trips they are convenienced they should follow in behind us and go back to see what they missed. Little Mason gives an OK as well. He looked to be about 4 or 5 with plenty to say after tucking in tight behind Jim peeping around his legs to see Buddy’s waging tail. Is that your dog? What’s his name? Where ya’ll going? Mom and Dad, dad carrying the 2 year old are close behind. The trail starts to come back to me now, yes we turn up this little steep area and then there will be a sign for the falls right or take the high water trail above left. Falls here we come, down down and close now again to the water. Trail crews have made a rock walk out of the rock bank so your only inches from getting wet. Path about a foot wide and then a protruding rock bend to slide around. Last time here I was scared to death of falling in but today a receding creek makes this less daunting. And there it is, Laurel Falls. A much wider and shorter water fall than our Cascades but just as pretty. Kids scamper from rock to rock along the bank. Jim and I manage our way out for a group photo. Come on Mason get in here. Big arms, big smile, lets show them how much fun we’re having. We say our good-byes and begin our last 1.2 mile walk out. Only these last 500 feet straight the heck up rock steps to maneuver. Stair master to the max. Sure glad I got this little pack instead of big red right now. Buddy pulls Jim along and I’m wishing I had one of those too.Just a walk in the woods now back to Dennis Cove Rd. Our overnight trip has come to an end.PSOur weekend was capped off by sharing some magic too. When we returned to Jim’s car we noticed no sodas taken, hum no magic, it can’t be. We loaded up the cooler and then a hiker popped out of the woods. He had nothing but the clothes on his back and an empty water bottle in his hand. Say ya’ll have any water or know the next place I can get some? Well today is your lucky day. We opened the cooler and poured remaining water we had to quench his thirst four times over. Spam, pepperoni and snicker bars to recharge him. He was Texas boy having started his hike in Maine July 1 and hoping to summit Springer Nov 10, The Nun was his trail name. He was slacking over a 20 mile section today and had about 5 other friends behind him, and 5 or so miles left to go. We talked over 40 minutes and then he left and another showed up. I could see where this might lead so we dropped more sodas in the woods and had to say good bye. Our trip was now complete.","Pond Mountain Campsite

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477997,"What better place to have an overnight than at a shelter with a fireplace. Even better is a shelter with tarp covering the entrance and a fireplace. Even “more” better is wood already gathered and stacked ready for striking. Could it possibly get another step better still? Sure it can all ya need now is The Straggler but wonder where he is…….Us long trippers put out our trail magic cooler across the road of Partnership Shelter north on the trail in hopes to refresh any SOBOs coming by. Jim has had this idea for most of our trips lately and gives us great joy knowing we helped a hiker along their way. Have a COKE and a SMILE!We have almost 11 miles today and plan to do a little trail maintenance as we come across it. Saw strapped on Jim’s pack and each of us with hand nippers we head for Trimpi shelter. Here is where we’ll rendezvous with our short trippers L-Train and The Captain. They’ll be hiking in from Rt. 672 loaded with subs, tarp and refreshments walking an easy 1.5 miles in. Larry knows how to plan his trips. Like he said “if you don’t plan it then you’ll be walking some path a heck of a lot longer than you want and staying a longer than you need.” I did stress the need for him not to back out as I’d have no supper but he was quick to retort that the human body can survive for a good 3 days without food and I should be more than supplied with reserves to not perish. Ah that man loves me!Jim is coonhound free today with Buddy staying overnight at the vets. We do miss him but does make it quite easy to stop and go as we have already come across some small trees across the trail. That saw does the trick and we are getting our LAT workout today. The trail is quite easy and we are making great time talking the miles away. 4 miles down and we cross 601 dirt road with 2 hunters taking a break at their truck eating pizza. Say will they deliver another? Up and down, briars and twigs, no non-sense cut and clearing crew we are. Having fun doing what we love and giving a little back to make that path just a little better than before. A perfect day too, a touch of coolness in the air to keep from working up sweat. We’ll save that for tonight when them boys fire up pit in the Indian Sweat Lodge. Closing in on our second road and lunch stop Jim spies one last tree to cut but first things first, let’s eat. The South Fork of the Holston River runs to our back while the evening sun warms our face. Just like before we spread out our food on a ground cloth and refortify. 1:30, sure hope our other 2 are on their walk in by now. Shoot we keep this pace we may just beat them in. Wrapping things up Jim goes back to clear that tree and I head to give the Sawyer Squeeze a try. Yep never field tested this newest and latest water filtering device. We saw and heard a lot about these on our trip to NY and Jim has purchased one. If you’ve ever hand pumped for water then you’ll know how sweet it is to let gravity or a squeeze do the work. Fantastic water flow with little effort. Filled up a platypus to filter into my water bottle and then Jim could drink from the filter and fill his bottle. Hey Santa all I want for Xmas is a sawyer squeeze and sawyer squeeze. 2.8 miles to go. Within a mile we reached Captain’s truck. Good to see. They are in the woods. Dropping the tailgate we leave our nippers and trade for some cold beverages and even ice. Yep I have a zip locked bag for chilling purposes and plan to treat myself tonight while eating that Italian sub Larry toted in. My new pack is now stuffed with goodies. Only a little over a mile left with the open field to pass thru and a slight grade back into the woods before we should see the shelter sign. Ah I remember the last trip here ol Harry pulled a double cache storing stuff in the woods at every turn. Man he had sodas, chips and dip. I’m not gonna let him out do me this time. I’m a quick learner. Cresting the last turn Jim sees the sign. Funny I don’t smell any smoke. Guess it’s a bit early for a fire yet, only 3:30. We have made great time. Wow look at all the tents. Hope we have a spot inside and the shelter isn’t full!! A group from Richmond has taken over the lower portion of ground below the shelter and our boys have filled the shelter. Great we have our bunks. Wood lines the middle of the shelter floor stacked and ready. Bunks on either side for cozy sleeping. Tarp is hung and subs are here. Captain says they worked harder on camp set up than hiking in. Larry’s big plan again. We visit with our camping friends who are sectioning over a couple of days. Sun starts to fade behind the mountains. Guess it’s time to close our door and strike a match. Venting the smoke and keeping the fire just right Larry works to keep us safe and warm. Of course he’s setting just about IN the fire but hey a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do. A south bounder comes in and we offer her shelter, food and warmth of which she does take1 out of the 3. She elects to camp to avoid snoring or waking us up with an early departure but does come in to eat her meal in our lodge. Fire light flickers with our faces, stories old and new. The Inventor tells us her journey thus far having starting Aug 1 in Maine. Her hometown is Massachusetts, a college grad with aviation skills looking for a career when she finishes her trek. She made a few pieces of her hiking gear hence her name. We give her pointers on places to stay as she travels more south and wish her all the best. Stepping outside for a breath of fresh air I see and hear yet another hiker coming in…my head lamp hits his face and the eyes. I blink, can it be…Harry It’s Harry I yell out. The insides of the shelter holler out and invite him in. Yes The Straggler has arrived. Now all we needed was Web to make this night as complete as last time. The boys sure could have used ya sawing them logs and I mean that in more ways than one. The rafters shook with laughter, tumbles and then some snoring as the night grew long. We each took our turn carrying the tune. Even our low landers could be heard. The waning moon lite the woods so no lamp was needed our predawn pee break. It only takes one to get that train rolling.Morning broke with Captains wakeup call and one by one we gathered our gear for our trek from Trimpi. A place where good friends gather with a fireplace, a place that’s even better than better.","Partnership Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478882,"When plans fall thru or when I’m on my own why not choose an old stand-by the Rice Fields. Its close, its… well UP and what a beautiful summit. The open fields looking from ol Virginie off to West VA by God. This old standby is now something new. With the trail being re-routed due to the new gas line you now have a much easier way to the top of Peters Mountain and all on the south’s sunny side. I’ve hiked this completed path now 2 full times and a few work trips. I could tell exactly where I had slug my Pulaski and mauls to create this very path I’m walking on today. Makes it a little more special. My little spot seems so insignificant compared to all the miles out there, some 2170 worth, that other volunteers have laid down for years. I can’t thank them enough.Still getting the feel for where exactly I am on the way up I check my watch periodically to see how long it takes on the approach verses my return. I still think this way is shorter than the old trail but it may just be because it seems more direct to the shelter. The woods are quiet this morning just me and a few birds rustling the leaves. I don’t figure I will see a sole today. My hands are cold so the gloves are on even in full sunshine. 40s I’d say but a cool wind blows every now and again reminding me it is December. Long switchbacks make for some easy walking hardly noticing the grade. The rock work placed for good footing by the Outdoor Club of VT is outstanding. So glad I got to work and meet these folks and hope to assist again. Passing the water bar section big Ralph Robertson made with our Slim Jim’s assistance, Harry and Captain and more looks great and holding as placed. Water running thru as not to mess up the trail. The piped spring is working properly too. New rock cairns have been placed on the BIG rock to designate this is THE water source for hikers to notice passing by.Once past here I know my only step climb is ahead. A short straight up trail to the back side of the shelter and the fields. At one time the ATC had posted another section of relocation on around the side of the mountain which Bonnie and I did hike but that has since been closed off. I’m guessing they didn’t have time to finish so why not just use this path which was only for the water source back in its original use.Cresting I see specks of white. Is that’s sleet? Sure is. Just enough moisture blowing around to cause it. I waste no time getting another layer on while reading the shelter log. A few hikers have been thru in the last few days. Walking out for my view from the field I notice rhyme ice on the limbs and grasses. I timed this just right. 10:30am Sun warms as the fog rolls off the mountain. Fresh!!Again still on Lead dog time no need to eat lunch quite this early so I head off back to the sunny side of the mountain where I plan to take a set down and call out to my folks and kill a little time.Setting on a rock, sun feel fine, a click click of a stick I here. Hey Ralph is that you? A fellow approaches and then a lady. They are from Peterstown, Bob and Kitty Devareux if anyone out there knows them. They like hiking the trails less traveled too and miss the crowds. Well it’s just me today folks. They did know Ralph and have hiked his trails at Mill Creek. Very nice to have met them. My day wasn’t over before running into another older couple closer to the road and then a SOBO chick and two more guys just out for a day hike. I didn’t get to talk with the gal. She seemed to have her pace set to make as many tracks during this nice day as possible. I didn’t slow her down but did say hi and good luck. Not wanting my day to end just yet I decided I should take a peek at the other new relocation across from Pocahontas road. The old parking spot for the Rice Fields has been closed so I have parked up at the Poco Rd access so I just walked on past my car and up into the woods. New trail was calling me. Winding up thru rhodies and hardwoods I finally top out to yet another sunny side. I want to see where this section might connect. It has to eventually tie into the area around the New River Bridge. Might make for a nice walk along the water’s edge I am hoping. Not wanting to make this too long of day I elect to save the remaining miles for another time. It will be more fun walking with friends on the sunny side of life.","Pocohantas Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479308,"We hiked and hoped for some snow on this Winter Solstice day but it just wasn’t in the clouds. But clouds we did have. Only a peek of sky so blue. We didn’t let it dampen our spirits though gabbing and laughing from trail head to finish.It was a treat today to have a carload heading for the trail. Kiddos back in the mix along with Bonnie and the master of all gab, Miss Carolann. CA was quite surprised when I just pulled off the road to a random dirt spot. “time to get out and start hiking girl”. Follow those white marks and you’ll end up in Maine. I don’t think she is quite ready for all that but sure glad to be out headed for nowhere.Climbing our one and only hill today I clip off a pace unknowingly a tad too quick. “Hey Lead dog slow it down” I hear from the back. My sweepers are falling behind and I’m guessing due to that steady chatter I’ve been hearing. Rat ta tat tat. Rat ta tat tat they go. Of course I’m talking a mile a minute myself telling the kids all about my plans for our June hike to Mass/VT. Oh how that can go on and on. Warmed up and settled in at a more gradual pace we pop over the hill headed for the falls. But first what’s that up in the woods? A balloon? Go check it out TJ we all demand. Opening the capsule tied to its ribbon it reads…Retirement Community from Missouri. Holy cow from Missouri. Just an old advertisement. Well happily we could use a balloon on our trip and it’s tied to Anna and TJ’s pack. Water runs load thru the thick rhododendrons sounding off their back drop. I’m looking forward to showing off this place to CA and revisiting an old spot. We’ve yet to camp here during the summer having too busy of schedules. Rock slabs leading up to the water’s edge and the falls are slick. Not iced over but frozen just enough for black ice. Feeling my feet dance I slow down and give warning. Wanting to take a photo from a different vantage point I take Bon and CA down around the bottom of the falls. Easy girls we gotta maneuver down these ledges here. Now I can take a shot from two levels and get us all in the photo with the falls. After a snack it’s time to take this train on down the trail to get a few more miles in before turning around and heading home. Got to validate the drive time over ya know. Winding underneath a tunnel of green the rhodie thickets seem to protect us. Flat Flat walking too. TJ couldn’t believe this was actually the AT or at least as he knows it. Dismal Creek runs up ahead our lunch stop. A small foot bridge just ample size for us to set on. So how far have we hiked CA wonders? 3.5 miles ‘that’s all’. Yep hiking miles different than those in-town miles. Anna checks the map for our location and to familiarize herself for next time. You have yet to hike past here and we’ll be back soon. All the while my sweepers are now collecting trail relics. “Will this grow in my garden? Hey this rock will look good on my patio?” Specimens are gathered and off they go to get a head start on the lead pack. Chatter I hear up ahead we have caught them. They pullover so “hot soup” can come on thru. It will be a short trip back now that everyone knows the distance. Always seem longer when you’re not sure where you are going. Re-crossing a water outlet we steady so not to slip in. Slime on the wood bars can be tricky. Should we wait TJ asks as we head on out of site...a blast comes…’thanks for waiting’….well at least we know they didn’t fall in I chuckle. The road soon become clear and in our sites. We have made our Winter Solstice return. Walking thru the woods and laughing all the way.","Rt. 606 Kimberling Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479739,"There is no better way to bring in the New Year than on the trail and with friends. I don’t know if resolutions were made or even necessary. We were here and others were elsewhere. All we had was a snow dusted holler, a path leading and some sparkle in the air.When Harry confirmed Yes he would hike that’s all my Larry needed to firm up he was a go. To the falls, yes the Cascades, over in Giles County. This easy little hike is always my playing card to get interest up for a hike and will be a good short one for me as well after coming off the sick bed. Fresh air in the lungs warms my heart and spirit.Also joining us today was Adam and his faithful companion, Roxie. His doggy is a strong 10 years old and was anxious to lead the way. It has been a year I guess since we last hiked together and so glad Harry invited them along to reconnect. The parking lot was vacant but only for us and one other car. Oh and the forest ranger truck. That will deter any nonpaying parkers for sure. What’s $3 bucks anyway?Santa Clause left a little snow for us on the north slopes. Sure glad I am sporting the new jacket he gave me too. Nice and warm in it. 20s here this morning and with the creek running strong will make for cold start. Gloves, hats and extra jackets all are adorned. Roxie hops along to keep warm too.Previous weather has been packed down on the bridges making for a slippery step. The ground is frozen winter hard. I love this walk along the babbling creek. Frozen water formations hang from down limbs resting on rocks here and there. The boys chatter behind me as Roxie darts from me back to her master Adam. Us girls will stay together if you like. She is so happy to be here as am I. Coming to our halfway mark I stop to dig out some New Years Fun. Party horn anyone? Oh look and hats. Here have some sparkly glasses too. Dolled up and ready for a show we go. Say Cheese Please!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!Feeling the power of the sparkle Harry sports his glasses all the way to the falls. The Cascades flow at a modest pace leaving a splatter of frozen like lily pads in her waters down below. Long ice cycles are starting to form a curtain hanging its sides. Blue sky surrounds us up above but little sun light ever reaching to the depths of this notch. We don’t stay long, cold. Scampering up the stair steps to the fire road trail we go. Sunshine greets me… leaning my face back I soak up all I can. Time to say our good byes to Adam and Roxie. They have more hiking to do, going to Barney’s Wall. The temptation was there for me to go too. I had pointed out this destination to Larry from our walk in but got little interest then and don’t think I have any now. Football in on his horizon. So long guys and hope to see you on the trail again real soon.Once again the boys chatter behind me while we make our way down the fire road back to the car. A few more hikers are appearing now. Happy New Year, Happy New Year we all say. Hope your hike adds some sparkle along your way. It sure did to our day.","Parking lot Cascades

The sun sets and it’s time for bed. Now that winter has come in and our days grow shorter…that ol sun sets early and so does hiker midnight and I do believe my clock struck midnight at oh about 5:30pm last eve….Driving into the lot of the Big Red Barn Jim flags me down for parking. Buddy was glad to see us and greeted TJ and Anna with a long yodel and wag of the tail. Jim has lined up our trip and has another hiker and his pup Sophie coming too. Jeff lives in Winston-Salem and used to live up in Connecticut I believe. He is a PATH member of 25 years and maintains his own little section of the trail which we shall walk today.My old blue hen, the explorer, is gaining mileage with age (might break 240,000 today) but can hold a peck and a poke of hikers and gear and a dog or two. Load up my friends; let’s take to the other side of the mountain. Now I’ve been across this way to where we plan to start our hike and leave my rig. Once with Captain driving and another with a shuttle guy from the barn. Both I recall were about 30 minutes worth of drive but I sure didn’t remember how curvy. Topo map gave us a good indication oh and by looking up too. Close quarters made for quick get to know one another for Jeff, us and the dogs. Buddy was put in his place real soon by Sophie with a one and only growl as she laid down and rest for her trip. Buddy made his way over the entire back hatch, into the back set and back again yodeling and giving everyone a rear shot or 12. Trying to keep from a rough ride I eased around each twist and turn of the mountain feeling our way into Bland County. O’Lestry’s Picnic Shelter, our starting point today, and the start of my very first overnight backpacking trip some 7 years ago. Good memories. Today we hike South back to Groseclose. I’m looking forward to seeing Big Walker Valley again but remember there’s a climb once there. 10:38 our feet hit the trail. Humm some 11+ miles this will be close to finish before dusk. Storms have moved over all night and left the skies still heavy with clouds but no drops falls. Muddy trail will be expected and TJ has sported his “winter” shoes. Warmer than usual temps have us lightly dressed, with rain gear handy but if the sun had popped out I’m sure I’d been in my shorts. A grist mill is our first stop just a mile or so in at the North Fork of the Holston River. Massive in structure and mostly standing I’m sure it was the finest in its day. Moving on thru the open pastures it feels like home. Cows grazing only to look up briefly as we pass. Anna wants a pet but none close enough to reach out too. Jeff being the maintainer man he is clears the trail of every branch or blow down keeping the boys busy giving assistance. I caught myself setting over trees I never even thought about. He then cleared or moved from the trail while Sophie stayed along the trail patiently waiting on her master.Reaching the crest of the Tilson property we could see Big Walker Mountain and the grand valley below. Warm wind rushes around us passing though the fields down to only go back up over Big Walker. Heavy breathing and some grunts get Anna and I up in front of the boys wanting to get this climb out of the way, our biggest of the day a good 1000 feet up. We both have done harder but early in the hiking season our legs tell us it’s hard enough. We plan to have lunch at Crawfish Valley. Camping spots and fire rings are there and a good water source if you come this way. Jim has camped here before and gives us direction. And lunch was good, it’s way past noon, my stomach tells me so. The sun tries to break thru the clouds as we get our nourishment and talk about supper at El Burrito Loco when we get back.Jeff and Sophie lead us on over the next few puds and soon to his relocation section. He and his crew have been working on this relo for 2 years now and it will be open come April. Jim has come in to assist on a few occasions as well. A good spot for it too, we will miss a short steep climb that is now routed around. Red flags mark the new path but not so you can see just yet, both ends that connect to the old trail are yet to be finished so hikers don’t take the new path till ready for traffic. Work will pick up in March to finish so if you need something to do come help the PATH crew!!Passing the old Davis Shelter, now removed, to be replaced come 2017 we only have about 2 miles left in our hike. My feet are tired but I feel pretty good. More rain is to come in by 5 and I’ve proclaimed we should be done by 4:30 to Anna. She picks up the lead and we all follow in. The blue rain jacket is on the move. I’m behind Jim and get a good look at his newly handmade Baum Proof Pack. Yep his sewing again, whipping out a day pack from a large dog food bag of Buddy’s. Rachel Rays puppy powered lamb and rice for a healthy nutritious meal. “Just 6” It’s called. So how many miles do you hike a day? Just 6 Slim Jim will say! I think a new trail name may be called for, Sewin Slim?One last open field, the Davis Cemetery and we’ll be home free. Sure hope that black circling of clouds holds off till we make it to the car. Quicker step. Anna spies the gas station signs already lite up from night time. Interstate traffic has their headlight on. Yep it’s gonna be o-dark-thirty quick. Drops of rain peck down just to make us scurry. Crossing under the interstate Anna and I bolt for Jim’s truck getting our things for changing and head for El Burrito. The dogs get loaded in their master’s cars and the boys head on over. About the time our buts hit the seats for dinner, night falls. It’s almost hiker mid-night. Eating our delicious Mexican meal we reminisce about a wonderful hike, making new friends and beating the rains. Now if we can just keep from turning into Rip Van Winkle. Jim can’t believe how tired he feels. It must be the darkness, what time is it…It’s hiker midnight baby!!!PS: Hey TJ would you do me a BIG favor? My car is still over the mountain. Yep he rode back with Jim to pick up the blue hen. Some hours later, no kidding, he returns. Jeff and Sophie are probably in NC by now. Junior expedition leader Sewin Slim might be demoted from trip planning. These long trail days in the short dark days of winter are hard on a girl.","Rt. 42 O'Lestry's Picnic Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480384,"Back to an old standby today, the Ribble Loop Trail. I like this trail #1 because it is a loop connecting with the AT. Second and so on you get a good climb either way, ridge walking, an overlook, rhodie tunnels and some excitement when it’s time to cross the creek. Just ask Bonnie!We joined up at the 42/100 road junction. John decided he wants to hike today AND get back to Blacksburg for his basketball pickup games too. Wow gonna be a big day John and you’ll be cutting it close to get back by 3:30. He drives over behind us girls. Dismal Creek road is still remaining in good condition after some years past maintenance and extra gravel. It’s a good 3 to 4 miles back in the holler drive to where we’ll park and start the hike. Dark clouds hover above casting a ‘dismal’ start to the day. Sure hope the showers hold off and that wind till we can get off the ridge a little later. Deciding to hike clockwise starting up the ribble blue blazes we’ll have the hardest climb over first and then we can coast on around and down the rest of the day. Winding up and along the old path that was once the AT by the way, we tackle the most direct ascent of Sugar Run Mountain. Hey Johnny boy you remember this trail? This is where the Sandman met his waterloo. Puzzled he looks up the mountain. Sure is, this is the trail you walked in with your many pounds of sand in your backpack in preparation Kilimanjaro. That particular day we had already hiked 10 miles and were coming up this climb to end our day. Oh John hit the wall right here and poured out his sand. We looked for it but it had faded away. Just our memories left of that day’s challenge. Come on troops we got another mile before we hit the top of this thing and the worst is yet to come. Bonnie settles into her pace and says see ya at the top. Passing the old house ruins just shy of the AT the north winds greet us. They aren’t fierce but surely felt. The blue blazes run on up the fire road and I point out here is where we jump on the AT. White blazes will take us right and along the ridge to the overlook and our lunch stop. 11:00 now.John checks his watch and takes the lead while Bonnie and I catch up on girl talk. It was good to have her back on my heels like many hikes before. The woods thin and we hit another fire road which puts us just below ridge line and out of the direct wind. But not before long a snow squall hits and sleet beads up on our hats and jackets. Burrr.But before we make the overlook the sun pops out and high clouds fill the air. Good thing this will make our lunch stop nicer to enjoy the views over Wilburn Valley. Sleet did pile on the shady parts of the rock outcrop but we managed to each find a sunny spot to set. Angels Rest, Docs Knob to our left and miles of valley all below. Well worth the trek up. No time to tarry guys we gotta get this ball player off this trail. John asks for directions and if he could just walk straight to his car now. Well sorta but you’ll have to veer off the AT back on the ribble trail connector. Don’t know that you’d see it and might pass the blue marks. Then…well then….you’d be on your way south to Georgia. I still send him on out ahead. His long gate will make easier hiking for him out front. Bonnie and I will catch him on the downhill. And downhill it was for quite a few miles and before we know it we’ve reach Wapiti Shelter. Flatter walking has separated us again. I check my map to see just how far we have left and approximate time we should reach the Ribble junction. 2 miles so about an hour Bonnie. Sure hope John made this last turn…..The trail takes a hard double blaze turn and I see a foot bridge. Hope he did too… Coming up on a pond out this way I notice the red clay in front of me has no foot prints. My feet are sinking so know John’s would have. Humm.. Let’s hold up Bon. Make a call to him in case he took a wrong turn. That Sandman, you just never know where he’ll pour out!!Hey Hey Martha calls from behind us. My phone trying to power up to call him. “Man that trail isn’t marked very well back there”. Bonnie gives a chuckle as do I. No worries Sandman we were already making arrangement to come lookin. You hang close now we only have about a mile to go.Doubt is heard that this is so. Bonnie says she’s already walked a good 5 miles over 2. And John seconds. The easiness of the trail can make you think you’ve walked for miles only because you cover so much more ground quicker. But my watch keeps me attune to our distance. Trust me we are close. Rolling up and over a familiar hill I see the blue blaze and smile. See See. We’ll be to the car in 15 minutes. The Ribble Ramblers are coming home but first one last challenge we must face and this to me is only known. Dismal creek must be crossed. There should be an old log stretched across her to test our balance. Summer time it’s just a fun ford but not today. We scramble up and down the creek banks looking for an easy spot to cross. The log it is for me. Ya’ll comin?Steading myself I step and rebalance mid log. Take your time and you can do it. My feet shake and wobble. Deep breath and I’m to the other side. Bonnie is next. John grabs the back of her pack to steady her. “I got it I got it” she says. Taking one more step and begins to fall backwards eye getting bigger and bigger. Grab her John!!! He snatches her up by her pack like a falcon would her baby bird and deposits her back on the bank. Wew close call, now for try #2. Ok Ok I got this she says. Slow and steady is the trick this time and she makes it. Ok Sandman you’re up. Big John takes on the log like a man quick and with 3 forceful steps and he’s safe. Breaking out from the woods and past the last blue blaze the ribble loop is complete. We carried no sand only memories; we lost no one but rather found help from our friends. We are the Ribble Trail Ramblers.P.S. 2:36 The Sandman traded in his hiking shoes for basketball sneakers and headed for the court!","Dismal Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480640,"You just never know what the trail will bring and today it brought us ice covered everything. The 1860 Farmhouse, the Lindamood School and Glade Mountain all glistened with frozen particles. We plan to hike up and over Glade Mountain to the forest service road and back. This will connect another piece of the trail for the kids too. Hey remember last year when we hiked from the other side and tried to meet up with Fabio and 2 Liter? Jimbo rolls up and Buddy rolls out ready to hit the trail. He is sporting a new fleece jacket no doubt another item from the Baum Proof Gear selection of Sewin Slims. I roll up in my new rig. Yep have the old blue hen up for sale. Mine as well break this one in to some hiker trash right off the bat. Sunshine makes this winter wonderland sparkle. Feels like Christmas again. Walking up the farm road we will connect to the AT just past the old home place and head for Glade Mountain. Branches drape over the trail heavy laden with ice. Jim and Buddy lead the way with me giving plenty space for whip backs. Rhodie leaves clink together as we brush up against and under them, the ice not even breaking off; coated thick. Luckily the trail isn’t too slick under foot. Anna and TJ bring up the rear glad to be back hiking. They have been busy bees with new school learning, teaching, nursing you name it. Before long we’ll have Professor TJ and Nurse Anna with us. Before long we reach Chatfield Shelter. The fresh white paint inside is still in pretty good shape with not much graffiti. Jim searches out any trash left behind that he’ll pack out on our return. The kiddos have been this far on the trail but what’s up next will be new for them. Shoot I haven’t walked this since oh well since last year, haha. I had forgotten my hiking poles and wasn’t a bit happy about it. The grade up Glade isn’t bad at all. Guess we’ve been tainted by the hard climbs of other states recently visited making our Virginie meandering and switchbacks mighty sweet. The trail narrows pushing us the very edge tunneling through low growing trees and shrubs stunted by the north winds no doubt. One small opening has been cut to see out over the valley and Big Walker Mountain. Iced in on this side and bare dull trees on the other.Cresting the top put us in the ice mortar war zone. Sheets of melting ice began falling from the trees and gathered speed on the way to us. Look out IN COMING!!! Shards covered the trail like walking in glass. Beautiful but painful if hit. Hard hat area for sure.Temps rise more as we turn to the south side of the mountain and head down for the service road and our lunch stop. Hope the rocks at the parking area are dry for setting Anna says. All the ice has melted from the south slope and we are lucky to be out of any real wind down in this gap. Buddy gulps his water, 2 forty ouncers. Glad he’s not drinking beer! Hick’Up. We have our lunch in the sun while Jim inspects the white blazes around the road determining what could be improved to pass along to his maintenance crew. About face we go to retrace our steps back over and find most of the ice we just walked thru has in fact melted off only to refreeze tonight. Glad we are here now instead of then. Some of this could be tricky. Buddy and Jim blaze the trail back to the shelter so they can carry out someone else’s mess. Leave no trace people. TJ clears the fire pit. Anna and I press on ahead sloshing thru the now thawed ground. We meet a fellow hiker coming in for his afternoon trek. Howdy and enjoy your hike.YOOOODEL YOOOODEL!!! Buddy sounds off in the woods letting all to know he is out here and on their scent. Guess it’s his way of saying he had a good hike. Guess I should be yodeling too.","Lindamood

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480933,"Let’s get our hike on before the games on. Jimbo and I planned to meet at the upper parking lot of for the loop trail. We knew even if the parkway was closed we could still park here because the barrier gate is just above the campground. On my drive over I caught a glimpse of some white leg. Trying to drive and check this out without running out of the road I realize I have two holes in the inner thigh of my pants. Shit. I’ve worn these suckers out and didn’t even know it. Now I’m no Janet Jackson and I didn’t have a half time show to prepare for but I did have a wardrobe malfunction and I didn’t want to make a show on the trail. My mind races….I could take a chance that Sewin Slim has his sewing kit in his day pack or I could just let it go, NOT an option. It’s cold out there and my hooha would get quite the cross draft. Ah I could stop at Riner Food Center and see if they might have the solution. Pulling into our parking location I’m the only one here which allows me the privacy to fix my draaws without much delay. Shortly Jim and Buddy arrive ready to get our Super Sunday Started.No doubt about it we’ll hike counter clockwise taking on the field hill first climbing toward Rocky Knob. I suggest we take the red side trail around the knob to see Buffalo Mountian view and just for old time sake. Many hikes before we’d come this way for a change of pace and I haven’t walked it in several years. Besides the over look at the shelter will be quite dull with the heavy overcast skies.Buddy is sporting his duck commander camo overcoat and his own pack with water and food supplies. Yodeling and wagging his tail he lets everyone and anyone within several miles know he IS here and hiking too. Passing the various parkway overlooks we turn down toward the woods passing the Floydfest venue and leave the cool winds behind for some tree cover and almost a ray of sunshine. Hiking down the gorge on this side isn’t quite as hard as the opposite end which we’ll have to climb out of at our finish. 3 miles worth. A father son duo approaches heading the opposite direction. We discuss our reasons for hiking either direction and Jim assures them they have hiked the worst way but offers them a rest and beverage from the back of his truck as they pass it by after while. I start counting the hours for approximate timing we shall cross each other’s path later. Jim already knows the race is on in my mind.The trail grades along the insides of the mountain crossing several streams flowing down her sides. Feeling fine we both hike a pleasant pace reaching the name sake of this loop, the Rock Castle. Various sized boulders cover the whole mountain side of the gorge. Our path cuts in and out, up and over them taking us to our lunch stop, the sunny side of the mountain and a bench. Chugging his water load away Buddy paces wanting to see what’s for lunch. Here boy Meatloaf Samich. Holding my hand for easy gobbling he tastes and spits out?? Jim dies laughing saying it’s gotta be bad for a dog to not eat, What you got in there? Sparing back, It was turkey meatloaf man, I got a heart patient I’m feeding ya know! Buddy did go back for a second try and ate it but only due to Jim hand feeding the little smartass.We don’t tarry as we want to get off the trail with plenty of time for pregame wings and things. The halfway point is just ahead crossing the bridge and now headed for the fire road. Last year the road was totally iced over with us having to wear yak traks for stability. Smooth sailing today. 2.5 miles worth of wide trail along the road bed and the sounds of the creek running full.The small waterfalls along the way added rock hoping to pass and icy cascades. Buddy slid across gracefully and we skipped hoping to keep our feet dry. The old farmhouse at the foot of the gorge has had some repair and loads of firewood stacked. This would be a fine place to camp but not allowed. You’ll have to go just down the way at the reserved Boy Scout area instead. We give ourselves a last minute pep talk before turning off the road and tackle the last 3 miles climb out back to our cars. Speaking of cars we see the dudes’ car from this morning down here. Wonder when we’ll meet up with them?I settle into a good pace for this climb as the trail turns harder and harder up for the roughest rock step section. Faintly I can hear the voices of hikers past, Harry, Bonnie…oh where oh where are you today? I’m never coming back here I think was their last words. Feeling their pain I press on and push myself trying not to slow down. I wanna crest this bastard before them fellas come along. Hoping to have a smile on my face and not a drop of sweat on my brow. Jim pressing on too with Buddy giving lead. Pull boy pull. Jim had to give him a lift on one rock slope. There was no toe hold for a dog and no room for a running leap. Hooraaa, hoooraaaah I’ve made it. Still some graded climb but we’re out of the worst and still no fellas. Come on Jim let’s get to moving and we’ll really look good when they come along and have to climb down this sucker with weary legs from a long day. And weary they were. When we met the son was stretching those legs while we talked. They both had smiles on but not as big as mine or Jims. Even Buddy gave a smirk. Good luck boys we’re out a here. We got some football to watch.Trekking the last of the loop glad our day was winding down. We joked of taking another lap but that would have to wait for another day and when in better shape for sure. We have much work to do to be ready for June’s adventure but today we had our game faces on and finished with a smile.","Rock Castle Gorge Loop

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481303,"Wind? What Wind? Is this 9 miles or 12? Where’s the loop? Is this Trail Boss trail? All I know is the lower water trail, the original AT, is now the high water trail, the new AT. Is everybody with me?Meeting Jimbo and Buddy at the Kangaroo in Bland greeted us with a north wind. Humm did we dress warm enough? The weatherman says 50+ today. He better be right. Besides it will warm up with this sunshine. It will warm up as we hike. Sure 60s easy maybe even 70 by the time we finish….Driving down the dirt road alongside Little Wolf Creek ice is still hanging along the creek bank. John reports on the car temperature gage 48 and dropping. Damn Bonnie says. We pull in the new parking lot and I’m already glad I have on 2 long sleeves and have another for in case. So which way are we going Lead Dog? Up across this bridge. We’ll walk the relo of some years ago to the high water path, now the true AT. No more creek crossings and wading. John leads the way up the switchbacks and turns. Woops don’t miss that double blaze dude. We’ll end up in no man’s land. A most direct way to the fire road this path takes and we’ll have an easy walk for a few miles now. Luckily we are just below the ridge line too. The sound of a train is above us. Wind howls thru the trees. Say was that a blue blaze back there? Yep Trail boss side trail I think?I knew this morning when we parked I should have walked over to review a new sign posted at the parking lot. Surely it would have made this clear to me. Not walking the trail boss in many years I can only recall where it is and now long. Online says 3 mile loop with the AT. But was it this AT I’m standing on now or the other way from where we parked? Jim is no help either only relying on his memory of maps and such. We’ll find out soon enough on our return because we plan to walk down this. Stretching his legs John gets a few turns ahead of us. Say does he know we are stopping at the shelter Slim Jim asks? Hope so or he’ll miss lunch. Buddy and Jim bring up the rear quietly while Bonnie and I chatter like school girls in the hallway. After a few miles I point out where the old trail came in to the left from the creek. I remember this spot having lunch with Shortcut and Pokie, Captain, Noni and Sandra too. We all had waded the creek and had wet shoes to dry out over lunch. Good times!!Fire road turns back to the north side of Brushy Mountain and into the cold of the holler where Jenkins Shelter sets. Frozen trail and patches of white flurries dot the path. All this down we have to climb back up…a sigh comes over the group. Hey but this will be the only big climb of the day, cheer up.Crossing the foot bridge the shelter isn’t far now. Icy waters and wind make for a damp place.Ah the shelter sets facing the sun and we gather around for our nourishment. Hey look at the little ornament in the tree. Jim says it must be left by the Barefoot Sisters after spending their Christmas here some years ago when thru hiked. Haha Can’t be, that would be too long ago. Maybe it is from 2Liter and Fabio? I wanted to show off the doobie smoking leprechaun at the privy someone drew on the wall but maintenance has been here and torn the side walls down. Now you have a nice new thrown to set upon for a great view for not only you but others. LOLAn old trail sign says 5 miles back to 615 (where we parked) but we plan to take that blue trail off. Wonder if it will be correct? I’m still feeling that when we walk back to the car and will see the trail boss but have not enough guarantees to say so out loud. I’ll just let the trails take us and we’ll find out. Taking the lead my legs feel pretty good on the climb back out. I’ll let John in front at the crest since his stride is so much longer than mine and beside Bonnie and I have more talking to do. The weather has become more agreeable and we cruise back almost to the ‘mystery trail’ where John has pulled over to wait on us. Leaning back against a downed tree he looks so peaceful I hate to get him up. Come on easy hiker let’s see where this blue blaze takes us. Down down oh I remember this now. This is the path the AT took when the bridge was out and they relocated here till it could be replaced. This isn’t the trail boss but it will get us back to the road. Jim seconds this and says be sure a take a right to get back to the car. Bonnie and John don’t believe a word we say at this point. They have decided that the 9 miles they have walked will only be recorded at 6 and that I am planning to make them walk addition trails to get the numbers to work. Oh the games Lead Dog will play. :o)One thing is for sure we all agree we are glad we are walking down this mile or so section instead of hiking up it. Oh don’t worry the kids have to come back and we WILL get a taste of this in redirection. Reaching the road we head back to the car and guess what…pass a little sign for TRAIL BOSS trail. Yep. So are we gonna walk it now Bonnie says? Heck we already hiked our 12 didn’t we? No John says we only did 6 remember trying to get a rise out of her and me. Jim has the right plan, since we are all set on being done today we’ll make it a point to hike this next trip.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482517,"What better way to bring in March than a trip up Cascade Drive to the Falls. I had planned to hike Angles Rest today but after finding out that a Chicago chick was in the area and hadn’t see this fabulous frozen place I had to take her. Besides after seeing some other posts of unbroken waste deep drift on the mountain glad we stayed in this holler.The parking lot was still snow covered and iced over from past traffic. Only a few of us up here this morning. Good!! Anna, TJ, Carolann and myself plan to share this winter wonder with Nancy Brewer from the windy city. Now she is most acclimated to the snow and cold and is well dressed for our occasion. I have a box full of yaktraks for every ones feet which are a must. This trail is one solid ice path. A small group goes out in front of us with the normal foot attire, tennis shoes. Good luck my friends and don’t slip up. I take my normal low water trail on the hike in. With few people out yet we’ll sort of have the trail to ourselves and can enjoy the peace of the woods and a few gurgles of the creek running under the various ice formations between its rocks. With the confidence of the chains on our feet we move without problem up the ice packed rock steps most of which can’t even be seen. Carolann and I are chatting away and I realize I’m sweating and must come out of a layer. I look back and Nancy is suffering the same in her snow pants and head band. “Wew I’m hot she says stripping off items.Slowing the pace we find a nice place for a group photo along the creek bank. Easy guys don’t get too close we can’t be sure where the land ends and begins with all the snow still on. Anna and TJ take the lead now while I hang back to chat with the girls, Carolann leading our pack.Unusually quite I notice we should be hearing the falls by now. Peaking around the last rock ledge we reach first sight of what’s to be the falls. WOW a frozen castle it has become. Layers and layers of water now frozen in time stacked high to the crest. No spray to mist and chill us today. The winds are calm and so are our surroundings. An ice rink basically has formed over the creeks. Not sure how thick but plenty of folk felt enough for them to scamper around on top of it venturing up underneath the ‘death’ of the falls. Not this chick. The view is quite stunning right here from the trail. Some crazy soles have dared to go behind the castle walls to the belly of the beast. Water gushes between the layers of ice. One slip or crack of the ice and good night sweet prince. Our group instead has our own fun preparing for the Hiker Olympics. The winter games come to Pembroke. Our moves show grace and somewhat balance on the ice. No Triple Salchow’s but we did do the camel position according to the ice skating world but guessing our scores would be quite low. Now for the last ice climb of the wooden steps back to the fire road. Again the yaktraks worked their magic and we had no incidents. What fun this stretch could be if we had a bobsled. A defined cut path a few feet wide leads off the mountain. I’m not sure my ass wouldn’t clear the turns but sure would be fun to try. Stopping might be a problem too. More folks are coming up the trail now both our way and by way of the creek. Slipping and sliding with a few screams as some fall down. Yakity Yak don’t talk back!!! Hey look a vine. It hung from the tree tops dangling right above the trail calling for Tarzan or our version, a TJ. Jumping up for a hold on, there he goes swinging side to side above us. Anna tries a go but too slippery for her to hold. Then Carolann does her best Jane and I think Tarzan ran off.Needless to say we fully enjoyed our day at the falls. Frozen now but soon to return to its beautiful flowing Cascades.","Cascades Parking Lot

Ice packed tire tracks lead us back into winter wonderland. “Boy I hope you know where you are going” Carolann says. Well I do know where I am going just wondering about turning this new baby around on single track AND a pickup truck is in MY parking space. I knew there would be some snow, like on the ridge tops but man it’s everywhere over here in Giles County. My plan of the south side of the mountain would be clear is merely a thought, reality 5 inches!Carolann has joined me today. City Slicker dressed to the nines trying to pull of some sort of hiker fashion all the way down to her toes with her golf tennie shoes for traction. Her version of yak traks. Forgetting her hiking stick I share one of my hiking poles and we take to the trail. I just love taking someone on the AT that has never been to a particular location. It makes it all new for me and of course I’ve got to tell of all my tales from here and some history of the trail. She was quite curious about the founding of the AT and how the path connected from GA to ME. Sorta made following the white blazes a little more pertinent. Glad this relo is a gradual approach to the Rice Fields or this could have been a killer day. Old route would have been quite difficult and much too long for my newbie. This 5 mile round trip in the snow is gonna feel like a good 7 or so. Glad we have these big boot foot prints to step in. He must be with the PA licensed truck where we parked. Reaching the fire road CA asks if “this is it?” Oh no my friend we got another section of up to hike before we can say half way. But this is half way to the top. Still smiling I know she up for the challenge. Rocks covered with snow make for a landmine of miss steps and I manage to hit all of them leading the way. Carolann is in a stitch laughing at me bobbing up and down as each other steps falls thru the snow. Retrieving my leg out almost causes a few lost shoes. This big girl needs more snow pack to stay afloat. Soon we reach a part of the trail I helped work on and brings back fun laughs from that day. Big Ralph setting rocks, Jim lugging stepping stones, Harry, Captain and I digging that damn bank. Man it looks good even with a white covering of snow. Carolann was quite impressed the trail was all laid by volunteer work and mostly by hand. Time to grab another gear girl this is our last up of the day, the hike behind the shelter up the Rice Fields. See the top of those trees? That’s the goal. Head down, legs pumping, digging up the snow down to the dirt we go. Ice shards have dropped from tree branching forming designs in the snow.Cresting, the trail opens up to the fields and wild wonderful WVA. Snow blankets the ridge and we add the only color except for the blue of the skies. A rock fire pit has been built at the mountains edge for viewing from a fine rock seat. I found it quite inviting to take in the lands far and wide. If you keep walking north you’ll come to the Captain’s I tell her. Wow! The boot tracks lead on as we turn back.Carolann leads us down but says doesn’t seem right her in front and relinquished her position. I really think it was so she could cackle more at me struggling to keep atop the snow and bobbing between those rocks.","Pocohantas Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483940,"Wind? What wind? I ain’t afraid of no stinking wind….well once I was. Which way to hike, where to park? Only Lead Dog knows….Left with a choice of hike or not to hike, you know what the decision was…your reading this journal right?! Our plan to head to Bland went bust when Jimbo came down with a late night stomach bug. Yikes yes keep that at home.So I quickly pulled out my maps this morning and rattled my brain. Settling on parking at the foot of Angels Rest for an out and back I parked off the old rt. 100. I will hike south and then come back to my car and go across the New River Bridge to check out the other part of the relocation of the trail. Curiosity is killing me of how that section goes. Seeing a grassy spot across from the trail sign I park my car. There are signs no other signs for parking or pull off spots but I have parked here before and placed myself out of harm’s way and traffic. I have only hiked from the foot of Angels Rest one time and said then I’d never need to come back and do it again. The trail merely winds in between an old section of houses for a few hundred yards and leads directly up. I remember it was snow covered and a hard hike just to reach the road, 634, where we normally park for hiking to the top. My approach today will add a mile each way tallying 5 miles on this half of my hike. Crossing over the town road an inviting little blue picnic table sets in a thicket of white pines. For a northbound hiker a nice resting spot before walking all the way up some of the elevation he just descended to get into town. Clothes hang on the line and wind chimes wrangle loud with the gusts of air. Never mind me I’ll be out of a dog’s bark away in a flash. Wanting a good hard work out this 2100 foot climb to the tippy top will do the trick. Let’s see what the gym work has done for me so far. Legs feel good, lungs feel good. Pushing off with my sticks with every step it feels like no time and I’ve reached the road. Either I was really out of shape long ago or I’m in better shape than I thought. Actually I think I’m just seasoned on what a truly hard climb really is and I’ve seen much worse out there. This is no slouch but it ain’t no Liam Neeson, Jim!Wild wind cuts thru the road gap as I hit the “regular” hike to Angels Rest. Sunny skies and warm temps have me in shorts today trying out a new pair I might wear for the big trip. Cracks and creeks of a tree trying to break get me standing to quick attention. Looking up I see the culprit, a dead tall black pine. They are ugly trees just looking to be mean. Startled I wait for the wind to lay and make a dash for safer ground up the trail. Hey did I just speed hike? I ain’t no Jennifer Phar Davis that’s for sure.Soupy places on the trail were few but just enough to make me take my time to tippy toe around or through. And then a fellow hiker appears, coming off the mountain. He said it was too mucky for him just up the way so he turned back. What? Ok well I guess walking in a rain soaked creek of a trail in Jersey has me seasoned again. Seemed pretty darn good to me considering all the snow and rain just left. I have the rest of my climb to myself. Just me and the sounds of spring. Chirps of robins as they dart from limb to limb. Trickle trickle of the creek flowing between its rocks. I told Larry I’d make it to Angels Rest before he tees off today at 11:30. Shout out down there its 11:09 baby!!! I’m sure the town of Pearisburg didn’t hear me but I told them just the same. I didn’t stay for long either. The shady area and wind turn me bitter wanting my gloves while walking back to the AT. Noticing a fire spot someone had left just before junction signs I looked closer and made out a torn up sleeping bag had been left behind and a lighter. Man hope this guy didn’t freeze out and just set himself on fire! I found no other clues…Strange? Onward to the next overlook, and my turn around point, some ice is still left in the trail. Packed down from previous hikers it’s having a hard time melting between the shaded rocks. Surprisingly I’ve been out of the wind most of the day and even once I crested it didn’t blow me away. I pondered the idea of walking on out the ridge but decided my luck might run out and decided best to enjoy what has been given to me, a sunny spot out of the wind here on this overlook. It is St. Pattys day sorta this weekend. Everyone celebrates early when it falls during the week so I’ll thank my lucky charms today!After a snack and some bird watching I head back the way I came. Shouldn’t take me long and then I’ll see what lies across that bridge. Feeling the down a bit in my knees and thighs I know I do have more work yet in that gym and will pick up some more miles over the coming weekends. Look out fellow hikers get set to get prepared.I ended up meeting 7 more hikers and 2 dogs in their own sets heading for the top. Some looked more enthused than others but glad to see them out.Coming back close to the road I smell a fire. Humm must be one of the area houses still keeping the coolness from his home. Smelling stronger. Is that a mound of snow on that knoll? Surely not. It’s a tent. I never saw it hiking in this morning. They, he or she, has stealth camped strategically out of sight except for this direction. It must be their fire. I don’t investigate since I am hiking along but I am curious. Tent was too big for a thru hiker but could have been a weekender. Have fun and be good over there as I click on past. Down Down I see my car glistening in the sunshine. She does look nice! But what’s that, a car has parked there too. Wait, not only parked there but directly behind me. Say What? Coming out of the woods back in town I get closer and see they really don’t want me to leave and have trapped me in. Hummm, I’ll address this when I get back. I have more hiking to do and the day is young, 1:00. I haven’t had my lunch and really wanna have it on that new trail maybe down by the river if it passes that way. So I simply keep on trucking.Heading into another small pocket of woods the trail leads past a cemetery and over to the bridge. This half mile walk only has me thinking of why would someone block me in? They had no license plate. So where did they drive from?   My wonderful day in the woods has turned to frustration now and I decide looking out over the New River my crossroads has come to an end. My intuition is turn around.My mind races as to the intentions of this move. I can simply drop my rig in 4WD and pull right out. Guessing they know that…Walking around my car and theirs I see no one around. I can’t lift my hatch so I load up front and simple pull out. Sorry if I violated some ordinance but simply just leave me a note. Hey don’t park here please. Driving to find a place down by the river to have my lunch is the best I can do to end up my day and then I notice it, the note. It was hidden under my windshield wiper. PRIVATE PARKING. Don’t tear up my yard, I have your tag number and will call the police. And they left me their phone number. How nice. Needless to say I didn’t see the need to confront this person since they had an agenda much more troublesome than I. Oh and I didn’t bother a blade of grass in “their yard” even though I had to drive up and over the bank to get back in the road since I was trapped in. I shall not park here again, don’t worry and advice others the same. I shall not leave you with a sour note but rather this…TAKE A HIKE!","Pearisburg

Fog was gathering as weather was turning more and more like rain. The road will already be saturated from all the moister over the last weeks. Snow, melt and rain want make for a clean rig for sure. Jim’s trail maintenance men had just been up Rt. 623 this week and said passable with a few washed spots to travel over slow. This will not be my first trip up this way, once in old blue and a few times with the rough and rowdy driving of Denny Wayne and the Captain. Both of which seem to travel at interstate speed on mountainous roads and travel the speed limit on the highway. Go figure. The Bland exit approaches do or die time? Stay, go, turn yes, turn no…..look out mountain here I come ready or not. I’m taking the high road, Get’er Done. Turning onto the Burkes Garden Road it will take me about 25 minutes to reach Jim. Sure hope he is there after a long wet day of trail work. He and Buddy might have said the heck with it and gone home to dry out. Knowing the likelihood of cell service we made last contact at noon today. Harry is due in at 6:30 as am I. He is coming in the low road, shorter drive in from Bluefield.Be bopping along, winding up and over the turns of the mountain I’m half way in and no problems. A mud slinging misty mountain drive it was. Nearing the top I know of at least 4 four hairpin turns. Thicker fog but not so I can’t see just want to get parked before night falls. I have a tent to set up ya know. And a fire to build.Head lights beam around my next move. Trail worker #1 coming out in a small pickup truck. Then a honking long suburban breaks around the last turn. Seeing me he backs up as I have not an inch to pull over for him to pass. Not knowing what is around up ahead and I keep my foot in the gas and hands 10 and 2. Just a nod from this ol girl passing worker #2. Thanks I shout out the window, him looking for me to stop and chat. No way buddy I’m chicken shit in this mud not gonna visit at this location. A heavy sigh of relief comes over me I’ve made it and then sets Jimbo and buddy in their warm pickup truck. No time to waste, fire gets built. Yes we brought dry wood and kindling. Tents go up. Yes we tented it is Spring ya know!!! I hear ya laughing now. Harry arrives and gets his eurovan parked for his night spot. We’ve all made it now what?Well nothing left to do now but make the best of this vernal equinox by setting by the fire roasting a hotdogs, wearing ketchup and telling lies.","Rt. 623

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484810,"Waking to a pitter patter of rain on my tent it was pitch dark. I was a tad disoriented since I’m just getting used to my new shelter. Zippers in a different place, Glasses and light in a different location, hurry girl or you’re gonna be sleeping in the wet spot. Fog was still covering us 3:30am. Hope it clears for my walk today. Buddy’s collar rings me awake. I was waking up for good anyways. My mat had me restless wondering if I had sprung a leak. It sure wasn’t as full as when I went to bed. The boys begin to rustle too.Having a good fireside time last night it was time for all to go our separate ways. Jim’s work is done here and time for he and Buddy to head back home. Harry is off for another work detail and me I shall get my hike on, lonewolfin once again. (mama ain’t gonna be happy)It’s 6 miles out and back for me to look over Burkes Garden from the north end, Chestnut Knob Shelter. Been there done that so I know it will be a haul but I’m up for it. Clearing skies make for a nice start to the day. It is still cool on the mountain; I’m in my silk long johns, wool hat and gloves with hope of shorts and short sleeve by noon. Remember each of the many puds on the start I make mental notes of check points to give me a time line of how far I’ve gone for the way back. This sport will be an hour from the car and that spot will be 2 hours. I could say exactly where our group had lunch that first overnighter I had planned many years ago. Here between these split logs. And I could say right where Dad took his slip down on a slick rock. I was so green to backpacking I’m ashamed to say all the stuff I carried that weekend. You’ll just have to flip back in my journal to find out. It’s in here.I have to say I do miss walking with my friends. Makes the miles pass but the solitude is cleansing. My mind connects with every sound and is much more aware of my surroundings. Being careful to not trip or make a misstep I also take a mental inventory of what I have in my pack. Could I start a fire, stay warm with the clothes I have, eat, water…Yes I am prepared.One hour down , two hours down, I see the knob. Sure hope that touch of clouds hanging over the summit moves out so I can see below. I’ve been walking beside the garden rim all day. Getting just glimpse every now and again. There was one early view that I passed up this morning waiting for a better shot later. I will hit that on my return. What goes down must do back up. Every hiker knows this. Down Down to Walker Gap uggg. Easy walking. A truck is parked here, must be another trail worker out. A bucket of gas and supplies sets outside a sure sign he is carrying a chainsaw. Getting my pep talk up in my mind I grab another gear, lead dog low and start right back up the other side. Steep with a few resting switchbacks my legs feel good. I have saved enough back to keep walking a slow but steady pace and with just enough breeze I’m not sweating bullets.I think I can, I think I can, I know I can…the top appears, the shelter roof signals to finish line. The worker is there with his girlfriend. Fish and Jennie. Waving out to say hello we meet and greet. He has hiked the AT and is now working on a second run sectioning and Jennie is clicking off her miles too. I thank him for all his work, he and a 72 year old man are the worker that have cut all the interfering tree tops preventing a vast view down into Burkes Garden. Setting down I take in this wonder view. Sunny skies with high wispy clouds over numerous green patches of farmland dotted with white building and red roofed barns. Amish lands and others, what a place to call home. Chatting with Jennie and having lunch we talk for an hour while Fish continues his trail work by checking out the water source at the pond. Nice talking gal but I have miles to walk before the sun goes down…well not that many miles but 6 is still enough back to my car. Well I’m still in those warm clothes having to put most of what I had taken off back on while setting in that open field for lunch. Now to repeat all of what I just walked it is more fun just knowing when that next hill or down is coming, no surprises. I leave a note at their car in hopes we may catch up again soon. Time to shed these long johns for good. Warm air settles and this has become the most pleasant of days. Very still and quite calm with hardy a noise in the woods but my feet touching the trail leaves. Counting my last hard climbs #4 is over and only rolling puds left before I’ll soon be back to my car. But I must first get that one last view of the land I came to see in the first place, God’s Thumb Print, it has been called. With only a 5 minute walk back to the car I lay back on the resting rock watching the hawks glide over the garden getting that bird’s eye view I’m trying to perceive. Even a walk alone isn’t really alone…you see…..","Rt. 623 - Garden Mtn Camp Spot

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485879,"Back to Bland we go for some more training miles. Jim and I have both walked this section but never an out and back. 14 miles in front of us and today looks mighty nice for a walk in the woods.Coming off a cold Saturday and night the temps on this clear morning are in the 20s but we expect maybe 50’s today. Dressed in layers, Buddy Coonhound included we hit the trail about 10am. Not remembering the road walk I probably would have parked us on up to where the trail cuts into the woods and more off the road of 52. But hey I have parked there before and without incident I might add. Jim was quick to verify before walking away from his truck to follow me.Trail Magic right off the bat. A case of water and bags of sodas. A thru hiker will be mighty happy to come across this. It’s a wonder they didn’t freeze. Maybe only left just this morning. Setting a good pace the grade is easy along the fire road winding in and out around the inside of the mountain. Darn cold in the cove too. Gloves and wool hats on with snow dusting under foot. Glad the wind isn’t hollowing or this could be quite a different hike. In and out of the sunshine we chatter about getting ready for our upcoming PA hike next week. We started to dub it the mile crusher but have come to our senses and not planned 20 mile days but 15 or so instead hoping to bump up one day to 19 to see what we are made of. Garden Mountain looms over us as we approach the Trail Boss junction. Finally we’ll get back to this old path we both have walked but long ago. We each called its location just about. After all the cove walking I was glad to back in open woods. Jim tells of his maintainers working on this section and I have to say it is much easier to follow than my last tip here. Before we know it our half way mark approaches, the road at Little Wolf creek. Walking across the little foot bridge I spot a nice swimming hole for the summer months.We settle in for lunch on the large rocks around the new parking lot area. One car left here by someone. Legs and lungs feel great after 7 miles but it was mostly down to here. We’ll see how we fair going back. Jim checks out the kiosk and note posted by forestry/ATC…Fire along the trail one mile ahead. Fire today? I didn’t smell any smoke nor see any. Says passing is not restricted by trail. Guess being on the other side of the ridge on the Trail Boss path we were protected from it. Buddy gulps down his 2 bottles of water never making a peep. He has been so quiet today I wonder if the cat got his tongue. We all were pretty hungry hiking right up to 12:30. My tuna fish samich and a growler or 2 went down just about as fast as Buddy’s water. Still cool we had to put on our jackets while stopped but stayed very comfortable with the sun. Leaving out of the lot we circle up the white blazes and hit the trail back. Not more than a few hundred yard to we walk right up on black earth. Fire fire but no smoke nor blaze. Soot smell fills the air. The fire has run right along the trail even making its path with every switchback. Sure glad we didn’t walk up on this went lite. Feeling the ground I was curious if it still held heat but not felt. Buddy’s keen snoot filled up however. Snorting and sniffling he cut quite a shine till we broke out of the fire pit.Switch backing to the ridge we soon close in on the Trail Boss junction. Full sun and a cool breeze to clear the air. Nothing left now get this next to climbs out of our way….Wasn’t that the last climb Jim? I think the nice opening is up around this bend? And then another bend, and another. Shit how many of these did we go around on the way down. It was like the déjà vu over and over again. Diffenantly more up than down this way. No wonder we booked it earlier. I just start talking to get my mind off it. According to Buddy he is not fat…He barked at me every time I said that word. I mentioned how lean he was looking since his first hike of the season. Buddy’s Fat! Yodel Yoooodel. I am not he says. So much for that conversation. Hey is that a hiker up ahead? 2 kids loaded down taking a break on our last turn of the trail we predict. They are headed for Woods Hole over the next few days. Group of 10 or so. These 2 are the sweepers enjoying their day. The fellow had thru-hiked in 2008 and the gals hadn’t backpacked ever but had hiked in New Hampshire while in school. Nice!!! Questions and more questions fly between all 4 of us. Trail Magic stops the fellow in his tracks and the gals wonder why such would be left here? We explain the finding of magic and how it is offered. Not even a soda drinker she partakes eyes glistening with pleasure. Meeting up with the rest of their group at the dirt road Buddy gets a good petting from all the ladies while Jim and I give them mileage to their first stop of the trip, Helvey’s Mill. One of my best shelter logs ever read was at Helvey’s, remember Harry? A boyscout troop had stayed and one of their own had bombed the privy. His bud warned all other passers to keep on truckin or for every hold your nose. I’m sure this group will have some great story to share with others and hopefully write in the log for us to find some day.Our day was coming to an end. The interstate traffic buzzed off to our left and the kids buzzed to our backs. We clipped off this 14 miles in under 6 hours without pressing to hard.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486994,"Arriving in Cascade MD after night fall we headed straight for Rocky’s Pizza joint to carb up for a big day tomorrow. I had called ahead to see if they offered adult beverages and the reply was we have BYOB. Humm, is that by way of brown bag or cooler I asked..As you like they replied. Well what do you think we carried in?After a 4 hour drive following a work day a cold brew to wash down calamari and one heck of a pizza I was quite satisfied. Jim polished off the scraps and we even had leftovers for breakfast and a slice for the trail. Jim had already been to the park so he knew exactly where to direct me. The park is not in town but is just above town overlooking Waynesboro PA. We were parked right between the road and houses in the parking lot. Pavilions, bath houses and picnic tables all across the road with the AT running right thru it all. We’ll hit the trail in the early morning. We want at least an 8am start to get in our 20+ miles targeted. We’ve heard Quarry Gap is on hell of a shelter, the nicest on the trail 2Liter told me.Settling in the back hatch of the new Explorer we shall car camp tonight for a quick exit come morning. We don’t have repack gear and no need to cook breakfast we are set. I decided to try my old mat one more time to see if it would hold thru the night. I do have my new Thermorest Neo ExLite for the trail but hate to give up on my old till I am absolutely sure. With plenty of room we hunker down for the night and drift off to sleep.Baarummm dumm dumm. Barrrrummm dumm dumm. Sounds of marching drummers startle me awake. I lay flat listening closely. I rub my eyes. Am I awake? Is the infantry approaching? More drumming. I put my glasses on to scan the park. Dark, trees, street lights aren’t bright enough to make anything out. Should I wake Jim? Don’t you hear this man? We are in the middle of the revolution!! Get a gun. Stand up and salute. Do something!I lay back down taking my glasses back off and close my eyes as the drums fade away….","Christiansburg VA Park-n-Ride

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487028,"New ground today I can’t wait to start hiking. Hearing the wind in the early morning hours we both wondered if our day would be freezing but emerging from the Explorer we found temps cool but manageable. Nothing a set of rain gear can’t protect.Clear skies over look us and we over look Waynesboro. Not a sole around, just us following the white blazes. Mason-Dixon Line baby. We are officially with the Yankees.Clipping along at a better than 2 mile an hour pace we reach Deer Lick Shelter. It snuck up on us. 5 miles down before 10am nice. Time to finish off that last piece of pizza and check in with home. Jim calls his dad and I call my mom. Both were quite shocked we had service and to be chatting so early in our trip. Surprises are nice. Breaking up a long day in 5 mile sections or so will help us only focus on short term accomplishments and with the easy grade we are moving pretty darn well for 2 middle aged hikers. Lighter packs and gear are helping me too. Mine weighed in at 23 pounds and Jim’s about the same sporting his Baum Proof Gear. Water will be in short supply after the next shelter, Tumbling Run. We’ll camel up there and it will have to do us over the next 10 miles. There is water at Rocky Mtn Shelters but the source is half a mile on down past the shelters off the trail. Barefoot Carver leaves his wooden spoons there. Jim had contacted him for leaving 4 but we have opted to pass in exchange for a longer day.Warming to be a perfect day for hiking we are in shorts now and ready for a good cold drink of water. Tumbling Run approaches having all a hiker could want in a stop or stay. PA shelters are times 2. Two shelters side by side, sleeping 4 each with a picnic table between. This one had front floor board areas and gravel between all wooden structures AND an extra level behind with another picnic area and pavilion. Group Camping, tenting and this wonderful creek running close by. Had we not needed to move along I could have stayed here the rest of the trip. I did leave my mark though. Blow-In it up! Privy #3 for me and they were all stocked with TP, Trail Magic!!Trying out my new sawyer squeeze filtering water was a snap. Jim has one too and we plan to ditch the gravity fed version and use these from now on. Cameled up, 9 miles down, time to climb our first big up of the day. It’s short and sweet but in direct sun. We’ll have lunch at the top near Chimney Rocks. Runners and day hikers are starting to emerge now. A side trail or two come into Chimney rocks and popular place just like our McAfee Knob. Encouraged by most to come see the rocks we are saving every step for the white blazed path. Every little .2 or .3 adds up and with another 10 miles ahead of us we are banking what we have left in us.Rested and fortified we are off in search of those Rocky Mtn shelters or at least the sign for them and plan to have a snack and rest. More good trail leads to finally rocks of Pennsylvania. Not bad but slows ya down picking a better spot to place your foot each step verses fast paced flat trail walking. Jim leads us up and down and around what seemed to be repeating trail. Rocky Mountain it is surrounding us to our right and forest all to our left. Glad the path is just shy of them and only cutting over every now and again. “If this trail goes over those rocks one more time I’m calling the ATC” Jim shouts. I have them on the party line right now. Tell it man!!!Right when we think we’ll never get to the shelter sign it peeks out from the trees. Spits of rain are coming down now. Our sunny skies have gone and clouds roll over. Rain is expected tonight. All the more reason for our shelter stay. 5.6 left to hike. Shooting for a 6:30 arrival we’ll stop once more at Caledonia State Park. Here is where Texaco, a hiker we met last year in NJ, stopped after a 56 mile day!! Yep you heard me right. He did the 4 state challenge. Came out of VA into WV at Harpers Ferry, pass thru Maryland’s 40 miles and into PA up to the park. I can attest the terrain is doable but the miles?! Holy cow the miles. He passed out in the park, busting his head lamp and face, waking up looking for light. And yes he did finish the whole trail!!Finally coming out of this rocky section we are sure glad to be back on the super highway. Speaking of highway we have one to cross. Cars zipping by. Please don’t make me run. I don’t have that left in the tank. Feet are growing tired and Jim is ready to get out of his pack. Trail turns to park path and then paved walk way. Runners dart and families enter for the holiday weekend. Most of the park services aren’t open just yet. Snack bars and pool, bathrooms. A grouping of picnic tables has our names on them. Stretching out on top I air my feet while Jim gets a quick shut eye. My right calf has been cramping some. Wonder if that great shelter has a masseuse? 5:20PM18 miles down, 500 feet up…. Jim you ready? Still shooting for a 6:30 arrival we grab granny low. I’m actually ready for a bit of a climb to warm back up. And I want to be under roof before it starts raining. “come on Jimmy” I hear him chanting to his self. I keep looking forward for that next blaze to lead to the top. My new sticks digging for traction my first real test on them today. Leaning on them hard they pass. Cresting and flattening out we soon run into the Easter Bunny. Well not a real bunny but some of his Easter friends have been here. They have decorated 2 trees along the way with eggs brightening this dreary evening. Giving us a lift in our step we are closing in on the finish line. Thick rhodies line the trail, a beautiful rock step section has been laid with concrete. That means a road is for sure close by. Greenery opens up and bam there’s Quarry Gap Shelters. Log cabin style structures sleeping 4 hikers with a breezeway between all covered. Even has a wind block tarp to let down around the back of the picnic area. Closed in fire pit, benches and a stream right in front of the shelters. Look the bunk area is painted green and clean!! Jim Stauch the Innkeeper has quite the place. Another hiker is already here, Lone Bull from Delaware Water Gap. He is sectioning. His wife dropped him off at Harpers Ferry and he is hiking home. Has been out 7 days and plans to zero in a day after tomorrow at Ironmaster Mansion at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Hey that’s where we are going fella. Yep once again a change of plans.After getting the weather for tonight, rain and possibly tomorrow Jim has gotten word that we have a reservation at this hostel. Trail Magic!! Neal Quesinberry, old high school friend, and his wife have made arrangement for us. Now we just have to hike 17 miles to get there tomorrow. Piece of Cake.","Pen-Mar Park, PA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487115,"Rain pecks on the shelter. So glad I didn't press the issue and set up my new tent. I really wanted to give it a trial test with the new hiking poles that support it. I have practiced set up in the yard and the one time at burkes garden. Oh well no wet gear to carry. That is good. The new mat worked well once I let out some air so I wouldn't feel like I was rolling off it. Now to figure out the pillow situation. I used to use my big pack as the base but no big red any more. Guess I will check into the blow up beach ball style that Jimbo uses haha.Up before day break Jim is boiling up some water for coffee. He was asleep by 9:30 last night while I finished my journal notes. Packing up we try not to wake Lone Bull. He has a short day planned going to Birch Run shelter. That will be a little shy of our half way point and lunch stop 7.5 miles.Heavy skies keep the morning dreary but it is rather warm. We head out in shorts. Not long rain showers begin. Only one way to make them stop...put on a pack cover. Within 20 minutes it stops. With little elevation change the forgiving trail continues. Ridge walking cutting between two low mountains. Cross roads at several junctions and a few back woods cabins we pass. Very nice cabins by the way. Marked locked on our maps listed as reservations only. All of which had guests for this Easter weekend. Yet to have an overlook of town or valley we have been meandering truly in the woods. Ready for a break Birch Run appears. Another nice shelter with stained interior and layers of bunks. The wind has picked up so stopping too long will be chilling. Speaking of our halfway point today we will be coming across the 'real' halfway point of the AT. It moves a little each year with relocations but a mile marker has been built and placed to note it. Shippensburg road used to be it but now noted from 2013 past Toms Run Shelter. Another mile marker is Slim Jim's 900 mile mark. Yep he clipped it today. We can celebrate tonight at the hostel. Feet are starting to feel the miles now. Even on this super highway miles are miles. A few more day hikers appear as we cross some side trails and approach the last couple of miles before Pine Furnace. Having a quick snack at Toms Run helped but this down has me with a left footed limp. Hot spot on the ball of my foot doesn't bode well trying to keep up with Jim's race to 'town'. Feet don't fail me now!Trail turn rather ugly and broken with trees and brush. Park boundaries start to show, then park cabins. Yea the road the road Pine Grove Furnace State Park. We have arrived. The big mansion sets right on the trail. Three stories with a massive deck around, the ATC Museum in the back drop. Scampering from door to door we lock for entrance. All locked. Check in 5:00. We have an hour + to wait. No hot shower just yet....but what do we have here....a HIKER BOX!!A hiker box is a box filled with unwanted items from those previous. You might find a partial filled fuel canister, snacks, socks, various clothing. Cool it still is and we are a little sweaty from hiking in why not find some goodies to make our wait comfortable. Within a few minutes we have ransacked the box adorning wool hats, speckled socks, new pants and shirts. Cheers to another good day. Clock struck 5 and Mike arrived. He checks us in and shows us to the showers and bunk rooms. Since we are the first hikers of the season we have full range. Cold soda and pick of our bunks. He an Mary are new to this Innkeeping location but have run other places before. They are as excited to see us as we are of them. This old home is over 200 hundred years old and Mary is all about its history. Now for the real Trail Magic... Neal and Kim. Wow! Freshly grilled rib-eyes for steak tacos, cheesy grits casserole, salsas galore and more speciality beverages than I've seen in a Kroger isle.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487227,"With all the magic from last night I had just about forgotten how soar my left foot was. A silver dollar sized blister had worked up under my callus in the ball of my foot. It had bothered me some coming into town and walking around last night I really could tell it was angry. Now to get it trail ready for our sprint to Whiskey Springs. Maybe I could soak it in those flowing waters for medicinal purposes?Neal and Kim had their instructions to leave my car there by 2:00 today. Jim had worked out this new drop spot to get a full 50 miles hiked. They seemed to know this road and assured us no problem the car would be there. We also agreed to slack pack today. After hiking some bigger than usual miles why not? Emptying our non-essential gear for a day hike would truly help our feet and improve our chances of arriving on time. Our quote of the day “Slack Packing Ain’t Cheating!”Getting our last taste of town we tidy up and have a delicious breakfast. This country gal decided what better way to start her day than with the last slab of ribeye packed for the trail last night. Would taste mighty good this morning with a waffle!! Jim downed his 2 standard and I gave him one of mine. No since in being a pig!!! Mike and Mary sent us off with a true sense of satisfaction. Big hugs and Happy Trails. Hey we’ll see you again hopefully in the fall I still have to visit the ATC Museum ya know!What’s this my car is still here?? Humm thought they would take it on with them last night for delivery today. Oh well only can hope that will be the case later this eve.13 miles ahead of us today. Simple, just one foot in front of the other. Hope the trail is as easy as the last 2 days. Neal has informed us maybe not just so. We can only imagine….Walking thru the park we pass several folks fishing along the inter lake and soon we begin our first climb of the day. My foot aches with pressure. Jim moans a bit pushing up the grade. Glad there are no steps. Runners come from the top having made a loop back to the park. Rain starts to spit. Much cooler today upper 30s with wind chill so we’ll try not to get too wet. Rain jackets on and of course that pack cover to keep the rain drops away. Hey it does work…shortly a ray of sun popped out and warmed us just enough to shed. Still looking for a view over a valley we walk on thru the woods more and more. Rolling ups and short downs with protection from the winds. Gloves and hats had to go on. Aren’t the March winds supposed to be gone by now? A hiker approaches… an ol South Bounder we joke. She was a young gal having already hiked up north and had to come off last year. She picked up where she left off and his hiking to GA. Snapshot was her “old” trail name and is looking for a new one this season. I’m sure one will stick soon enough. Telling her of what is coming her way and to not miss stopping to see Mary and Mike we move on. Not taking many breaks today since we are on short time wanting to get our miles in and drive home. We’ve pushed thru a normal morning rest and have not stopped. We are in search of James Fry Shelter and it couldn’t come soon enough. Pop, wet water oozes between my toes. The blister has blown. Feeling some relief I know I’ll need to doctor this. We find a sunny spot somewhat out of the wind and set down on the trail. No need to waste steps for the shelter this will do just fine for lunch.We know we can’t be too far from a road as another runner comes by with his trail dog. Jim looks over the maps and calculates we only have 6 miles to go. 11:00 now, we are right on schedule. Jim has his leftovers from last night’s feast for lunch. Yumm still smells great. After my feeding I lather up that foot with new skin liquid, it seals the open part of the blister and we are off.Road over road the trail winds just within the outskirts of town. Train Train take me on out of this town…passing us by just after we crossed it’s tracks. Look a Hooters!! Jim wishes, turns out to be an auto service garage. They look so much alike. LOLHere we are now at Rt 94 and counting down our miles…my map say 1.8 to go, Jim’s says 2.8. Whiskey Springs Road is the next road. So no biggie let’s just walk to it and we’ll know. Within less than half mile we come to a road….already…no way we have walked 1.8… hummm. We look down the road left, down the road right. A car comes by, I have no issue flagging down. Jim asks Hey what road is this? Mountain Road. There isn’t a mountain road on our maps?? Yep this road turns into Whiskey Springs he says and drives off.   Not leaving us much choice we continue on. Jim scans his google maps on his phone. “Where the heck is the AT?” Frustration sets in. This option of leaving a car on a non-numbered road is not seeming like such a good idea at this point. We walk on….Hello.. another road? In the thick of the woods, we are on dirt road now. No place for a car to pull off. This can’t be it. Jim consults the google again. Ok Ok I’ve found it he says. I have already asked another traveler and we are still on mountain road and whiskey is up ahead he confirms. Jim’s map gives us even more confirmation on this. BUT why the heck doesn’t the ATC or ALDHA maps show these most important crossings? Starting now to walk up we concede that the 2.8 miles was the distance we needed to hike from Rt. 94 to Whiskey Springs. That Spring better be running full cause I sure need a Drank! Shit this is the hardest climb we’ve had the whole trip. Rock scramble and true elevation gain. WOW now this IS hiking. Another valid reason that slack packing aint cheating. Once to the top we think we are done for the day. Just walk down in this cut and there the road will be. Oh no there’s more rocks. Big Ass Rocks. Stone Hinge. White blazes go up and over and then down and between nooks and crannies not meant for hiking. Why? Why? I say, We Say!! I guess we would have enjoyed had it been the first of the trip or just a destination hike but today this shit sucks. Muttering under our breath finally coming out of the rock scramble we wonder why if this is so important to blaze then why not document in guides? Tell us this is here folks. Say has anybody seen our Whiskey?10 till 2 Jim…There’s the road. Cars Cars. We scan for mine. Not arrived just yet. That’s ok we wanted to beat them here anyways.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492548,"We have waited for some sunshine and boy did it come this weekend. Not only did it warm our day but in addition we had Shortcut along to brighten it as well. Hey let’s not forget Pokey too. Yep our long ago met friends by chance at this very spot are back to reunite. All we need now is Harry….Shortcut and Pokey are back in VA to claim some more white blazes for their registry. They only like 8 miles in Shenandoahs to have VA complete. Driving in from Harrisonburg today they are meeting us at a side road where the trail crosses in Bland. We’ll walk south back to our other car we dropped off this morning on the way over. Bonnie and kiddos are back in tow and ready to go. With the young ones getting their college degrees finalized they have been sparse with the trail miles and poor ol Bonnie has been filling in for them providing me with some trail companionship. My mom and I thank her!!I’d tell you where Jimbo is today but you wouldn’t believe me so I’ll save that story for a time when you are with us and we’ll hear it first hand from him for ourselves. Pokey and Barb (another hiker friend of theirs joining on some trips now) bring up the rear as we head into the woods. Shortcut says, Lead Dog lead, so I do. Not hardly up the first grade I can see I must back this train down and settle in to a more leisurely pace. We have a wide range in ages out here today. Our seasoned folk in their 70s are quite the hikers but at a little different step. No worries I plan to visit on this run. You kids go on out ahead I’m dropping back to see my gals.Now Pokey has that name for a reason. Even in his younger days he had a speed all to his own and Shortcut knows this. They walk well together. His plan is to walk about an hour or so and turn around and drive back home to Asheville. Good that Barb is along because we plan to steal Shortcut away today. Getting the chance to stretch her legs she takes advantage of having some friends along and a ride back to her car. You go girl!!!This isn’t the only surprise she shares with us…story after story of her latest happenings. Shoot she was in a holiday fun run and jogged her way right to winning the senior’s division trophy. Sherry Brooks step right up and take your prize!!! She was right on my heels all day only to drop back a tad on those inclines. Bonnie kept saying this is a good pace!!!We talked of upcoming miles and northern states yet to visit as we meandered over the ridges under foot. Springtime surrounded us. Blooms and buds, birds and butterflies. Green pastures galore. I have missed you great outdoors!!!The trail wasn’t just ours today. We met nearly 30 thru-hikers on their way to Maine. Coming in pairs of two mostly hiking with a purpose and a smile. What’s with the blue tape? Just about everyone had some sort of brace on a knee or blue tape on their leg(s). Finally asking a gal passing by while we sat having our lunch she informed us she was nurse good body and had provided her medical services to keep them on the move. Wish I had taken a picture of the 2 captain America dudes in highty tighty American flag shorts. Didn’t leave much to the imagination as my mom would say. Head bands and Hair, wearing little more than a smile. Nice!!!Shortly after lunch we gave the kids Bonnie’s keys to transport the car from 52 on back about a mile to where we’ll come out of the woods. No need to rewalk the blazes up the hardtop. Besides Shortcut just walked that a few days prior. Glad to have them along for any need be action. They are great. Reminiscing over the last few miles left in our hike made for a quick finish. Bonnie couldn’t believe we had arrived at Helveys Shelter and only had a mile left. We’ll be out of the woods by 2:00. We tried to guess where all the hikers would be spending the night. 2 fellas were headed for Pearisburg in the next 2 days hoping to make it on what was left of their food. Hey don’t forget to stop by the Captain’s I reported. Zipline to cold drinks on the back porch. They cheered and hooped and hollered disappearing up the trail.We did the same coming out of the woods to finish the day. Woop woop we say. We shared trail magic with friends met new and we shared our hike with Shortcut too!!!","Rt. 611 VA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/494022,"More miles more miles. We got to get those miles before we head up north. What better place to walk a many than with the ponies and open ridges of the Grayson Highlands. Not only ponies but how about the thru-hikers? We rolled into Fox Creek parking off 603 outside of Troutdale. Cooler of drinks, bag of apples and our TRAIL MAGIC sign. I hardly stepped out of the car before a chick came calling for a taste. Zen from Cal-I-forn-I-A following her dreams. Then another gal from Philly gonna walk for a bit longer till Trail Days rolls up next weekend and get a ride back after helping Bob Peoples and his Hardcore Crew. We had dispersed out several drinks before moving the stash on into the woods. Let’s get this train moving Buddy Coonhound barks. He has voiced himself over the last 2 hours of drive time Jim says. We have a good long 16 miler planned today. Some AT miles with side trails to make a loop back to our cars. Excited to walk a new path or two up here I can hardly wait to reach the crest of Pine Mountain.Thru-hiker after thru hiker we keep meeting giving the same cheer of confidence and good luck to. Oh and don’t forget the magic at the next road crossing, enjoy!!!! There were so many I forget all the names and states but 2 for sure stood out. Exchanging names I say I am Lead Dog to Old Eagle Scout and his friend’s face lights up and says “Hey I know you, Trail Journals!! I been following you since 2008”! Trail Legend, nah, I’m no trail legend. Just enjoy walking and talking about it. Sure hope we see you fellas at Trail Days.Feeling extra good about my new found fame I acquire a little extra pep in my step. Jim has mentioned walking this several times as well as I and we recall how this mountain kicked our ass back then. Big packs and less use to the trail we were, Green. Now some seasoned we are doing quite well clipping off this 3+ miles of up. Strange banging noises are heard ahead. Trail dirt stirred up, new water bars appear. This can only me one thing, trail Maintenance is close. Now these are the true trail legends. The famous Konnarock Crew. Groups of 3 and 4 men and women working hard to keep this footpath in fine walking condition. Hard hats, Pulaskis, Mauls, and Muscles. Moving rocks like no bodies business. I tip my hat to you folks. Thank you, Thank you. Smell of spruce and furs greet us atop Pine Mountain. Christmas time is coming, Christmas time is coming….the song rings in my mind as the smell of Christmas enters my nose. Jim’s nose has another kind in mind…Stepping thru the small turn gate from woods to field his eyes are on the butterflies…two cute gals taking a rest in the sunshine. Stumbling gracefully just about knocking his teeth out he just does get through the stile without hurting himself. Buddy too was moving pretty quick to get to nature! Oh SlimJim has Buddy trained well in sniffing out the finer things in life. These ladies had 30 pounds packs heading from Damascus after being dropped off at Fox Creek yesterday. They had hike in 5 miles, hammocked at Old Orchard Shelter, and are trying to pull off a 16 mile day today. We gave them all the packing advice we could for shaking down their pack weight. Make 2 piles when you get home, 1 for what you used more than once and what you didn’t. You’ll see exactly what you don’t need to bring next time. Horse trail time for us, leaving the white blazes for somewhat of a graveled path. This should make finding the ponies real easy. Wilburn Ridge is our landmark we can see in the far distance, its rugged rocky line stands tall above the open range of the Highlands. We pick out White Top and the highest point in the Commonwealth, as Jimmy says, Mount Rogers. Sun is really boiling down on us now. I’m loving this. Even the light breeze is pleasant. We both had figured 10 degrees colder up hear but not today. Also glad we came early in the season, Not too crowded either. After merging off the Crest Trail at Rhode Gap we are back following the white blazes headed for Thomas Knob Shelter and our lunch break. This will get us about halfway in. Traffic is picking up, the parking lot is only a few miles away brining day hikers and group hikers in abundance. “Gotta charge a fee” Ridge Runner Jim announces. “And leash that dog lady. No pet is to run rampant on this mountain.”Like a good ridge runner he shares what he has with others. Water water who’s got water. Dad and son are trying to make it to Mount Rogers and supplies are running low. Jim brings out his trusty sawyer squeeze and points him to the water source. I too am in need of a cool taste and follow them down to make sure all goes well with filtration. Having 7 or so miles still left we pull out taking in our last look at the wide open range before turning back for hard woods and rocky trail. On and on rocky trail. Can fell the feet now. I’m still trying to toughen up that blister area that peeled off. Looked good pre hike hope so post hike. Even Jimbo is sighing a bit behind me talking to himself to push on for a bit longer before we take a break. Glad we are hiking down this the heat is really felt now. Yeaa junction of Mt Rodger Trail. This will take us down to towards the road and Grindstone Camp area. 4 miles worth and then the last 2 of a Fairwood Valley Horse trail. Now when I say down it wasn’t down abruptly enough. This trail kept skirting the side hill, narrow in passing, since not a heavily traveled route. If you were claustrophobic you’d had a fit. Branches trapping us in. Finally opening up we hear voices. Families are coming in for mother’s day. Tiny tots with small packs hooten and hollerin having a good time. Bet that runs out in another mile boys! Big packs on daddy’s backs and somebodies gonna be carrying a kid. Buddy gets a pet on his head for the hundredth time of the day and seems to enjoy it too. Long switchbacks bring us to our Creekside walk and the sound of 603 traffic. Our miles are almost coming to an end. What better way to cap off this adventure than to wade a creek. This is a horse trail ya know. Sign said high water trail this way. We rock hopped one and now I stand in the middle of this crossing with no more rocks to hop. Buddy and Jim are already wading in. Guess this is where I step off. I wouldn’t have gone this far in for chance had it not been for coming to the end of our hike. Cold feet will feel mighty good right now. Ahhh as the water rushing in over my shoes tops up to my knees. Buddy shakes his paws while we do the same with our feet. Cooled jets and our cars in sight our magic and miles are done for the day.","Fox Creek rt. 603

Creek banks hung full of locals fishing and frolicking and the trail ran full of thru-hikers making their way to Maine. Just glad we were amongst it all. Setting parked at the Kimberling Creek spot where the AT crosses Rt. 606 just shy of Trent’s Store we awaited. TJ and Anna went up to the road to flag Jimbo down. We could here “them” coming….YOOOO, YOOOO, Buddy Lee Coonhound sounds off from his box. We’ll leave Larry’s truck parked here and load up with Jim and roll.Dust engulfs us riding behind the horse trailers traveling back to the various camp areas along dismal creek. Kiddos in the back of the truck….TJ has battened down the Hatcher, hood up and rain jacket zipped tight. Anna is unfortunately setting in the direct line of fire from Buddy’s muzzle. He hasn’t stopped since leaving Carroll County. Watch out for those potholes Jim! You gonna flip them kids right out of here. Back’er down good buddy. Settled in now for the nice country road drive it’s over before we know it and we are at our parking destination. It’s time to get this hike started. We’ll take the Ribble Trail (blue blazed and was the old AT route years ago) a direct 2 mile climb up to the crest of Sugar Run Mountain, connect to the AT, Hike south and wrap around off the mountain passing an overlook, Wapiti shelter, Dismal Falls and be back at Larry’s truck. No Larry, just his truck AND a BLEEP BLEEP traffic violation. You’ll have to ask him how I took getting pulled over on my way to get my Hardee’s biscuit this fine Memorial Day morning in the town of Pulaski which requires a town decal!!!!!!Glad to be in the woods out of the city limits I’m ready to lead this train. TJ has packed his full on gear for a test run today. Anna even has her pack on. They have been slack over the hiking season only carrying one pack and sharing it during the day. Time to get down to business biys and girls!! “You know what you can do! You better get to scratchin”What starts out as a gradual meander along the creek turns up and more up. This ain’t nothing yet what till be reach the butt of the mountain and hit the side hill. You’ll know it cause you’ll be out of breath. And that’s exactly what Anna did, ran out. Needing a break to cool we grab a drink. Face red and eyes wide she is wondering where the top is. With all the foliage I can only guess. Being a sunny day and warming by the minute it will be nice to reach the old cabin just shy of the crest and set down a bit. Jim thinks it close and is right. The old picnic table is completely on the ground now and not worth using so we find a log to gather on. TJ breaks out a PBJ samich while Anna and I knock out some Gatorade. We hear voices just above us, it’s the AT crossing.Rested and ready for a nice ridge walk off we go meeting hikers all along the way. Some out just for the weekend headed to Woods Hole and those pushing for Pearisburg and resupply. Wishing them all a safe hike to Maine we also invite them to The Captain’s this coming weekend. It’s Hiker Feed and Hippy Fest. Stay on or catch a ride back if you have already past. Burger, Dogs and all the fixins!!! Oh and Hiker Olympics and Karaoke. Chatting amongst ourselves we make quick time of the forest road section and reach the overlook. Unmarked, I’m sure most hikers never know it is here. Luckily with us stopped a few venture thru the blooming rhodies to see. Yes the mountain is full of blooms. Pinks and orange blazed flamed azaleas. Anna takes liberty to decorate her pig tails with them looking like Mini Mouse ears. I point out Docs Knob and Angels Rest so the hikers can see where they will be hiking to. Clear skies make for a warm bake on these rocks while we eat our lunch. Buddy and Jim take shade under the leaf cover and I do believe Buddy even layed down. What? No barking??With only 5 miles in we don’t tarry as we have a long ways ahead of us. The worst is over climbing wise now just to walk the remaining 11 miles. Sounds like a lot but really when you break it down in sections it passes pretty fast. Next stop Wapiti ShelterWhat goes up must come down and that we did, come down down down. Next time I’ll make us walk the other way and get all this up for a change.You could see the weary in the eyes of those we met climbing up. Heat and carrying heavy loads made for a tiresome section for these thru hikers. I tried to give shouts of encouragement and accolades for getting this far and pressing on. Young and Old, girls and guys, near and far, a Hodge podge of all. A trail of many we are. Finally in the ‘bottom’ the greenery shades us and the long tunnel of rhodie trail leads us to Wapiti. Not needing to go to the shelter we opt for water along the way. Buddy can camel up at each water let crossing and if need by we can too. The shade feels good as warm patches catch me in the face. Can you feel it? Warm spring almost summer like heat in the woods…..Now is when the feet grow sore and the legs a little more tired. When can we stop? Jim declares there is a road just up ahead and a significant bridge to prepare for. Yes you heard it SIGNIFICANT!! So what makes a bridge such? Its properties? Its size? Its name? Its location? Ok ok no making fun SlimJIm.For us this bridge was our sign to rest. Seeking shade even I pulled up under some short pines and found a log to set on. Shoes off I can’t wait to put my feet in Dismal Falls. This will just have to do for now. Talking of gear we plan to take next month Anna says Jim should come up with a patch/logo for his Baum Proof Gear. Maybe a Coonhound logo will work she shouts. Can’t wait to see the newest prototype BPG backpack going up north. From 5 miles in to now 5 miles left to go and 2:30 on the clock it’s all out hiking time. Good flat trail to do it too. Those tall old VA pines swallow us whole in the deepest of this forest. Just us passing thru with one thing on our minds….a swim at the falls. Jim told every hiker past that’s what’s on our agenda. Chuckling as we leave them I was about to believe it myself by the time we got there.Hot and tired and tired and hot. My feet feeling their normal throb burst into smoke when I dropped them in the cool wet stream. Anna was right with me too. Water so cold it made my head hurt, for real!!! TJ went wading while Jim as usual walked his pace in a circle leading Buddy from harm’s way and the many people now scattered on the rocky shore. Hikers dropped at any clear spot and made that their bed for the night. Cowboy camp was officially declared by one, Hammer Toe. He has hiked forever and been there and done that. And yes he does have hammer toe poor guy. But had a smile on his face and was happy to be here. Families had shared some sodas with the hikers and I was wishing about now I had stashed some cold drinks on the opposite bank on our drive in this morning. Oh well, that will save for next time and we’ll just leave the truck here for our finishing spot. Cooled off and snacked up we’ll say our good byes and hike these 2 miles out. It took no time really. Seems odd as I use this location (dismal falls) for a winter hike as it can be quite the work out with snow on and easy to drive too with road cleared. Here we freshening up in the falls instead of standing on them frozen. I do love what the trail brings to us ramblin ribble rousers.","Ribble Trail

Kenneth and his wife are due in to get the fish frying with hushpuppies and French fries. Hikers are gathered around the fire pit chatting and counting the minutes till they can line up and eat. Cold drinks and mountain elixir are passed around while tunes play from Bill and Mary’s Yurt teepee. Say if you need a hotel in the woods that’s the place to stay. Full bed set up, with center table and dog bed for Bell. Billy the grill master has his 500 gallon cooker ready to fire up for tomorrow. He and Dustin marinate pounds of chicken, ribs and ribeyes.

Seven is back to add to his documentary and Tuna has returned to add some of his creations along the creek. A mini Stonehenge to remind us he was here. Shoot all these hikers will leave there mark with us in one way or another and we hope we will do the same for them.

With AWOL’s line item in his hiker manual we have gone from feeding 25 hikers to over 100 the past few years. From a small gas grill to now a super hauler pulled behind a pickup truck, we can now cook for an army (thank you Billy “I’m here to F-Shit up”).Just a quick summary of what went down…180 hotdogs, 180 hamburgers, cases and cases of sodas/water, oh and a few adult beverages, 4 full size pork tenderloins, pounds of chicken quarters, 5 gallon tubs of potatoes, onions and corn, steaks, all the sides and just about anything that Billy and Dustin could flip. Oh and yes we had some more fish left over from last night that Kenneth “don’t peek under my apron” brought out. We feasted, we floundered and we flamed.Morning broke and hikers ziplined in all thru the day. Cars from Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas (oh yes The Straggler and Betty arrived) you name it they came. Miss Janet even wheeled up from Erwin by way of Damascus and any other back road she could wander to pick up a hungry hiker looking for route to The Captain’s. Baltimore Jack road along and shared some of his wealth of hiking knowledge with those already here. Tent city grew and so did our bellies. To help alleviate such nothing better than some Hiker Olympics. Not too strenuous but rather just good fun seeing who has the most weird shit in their packs, to stickiest shirt and most blisters. Hairiest legs, girls and guys divisions. Then a twist on Limbo, last 5 finalist got a surprise from the Captain by him adding a backpack for them to carry while seeing ‘how low can you go’. Phones blocked the air ways and cyber land was at a standstill in time along Stony. Cell phones line up the porch charging station like a display at Best Buy. I felt like celebrity when asked to join Captain for a quick interview from a hiker doing a documentary on trail magic. Well my friend you are at the right place. Look for it on YouTube soon.Karaoke kicked off the evening while the hikers built a tribute to the AT structure in the fire pit. Gather around all for a group photo before she goes up in flames. Our DJ filled the night with his own lights and the holler twinkled with color to match the starry skies. Some sang, some danced and some well just went on to bed.

I have scheduled a few more than last year so we feel refreshed and clean a little more often. Bus and trains and we are off to NY Penn station. We love this mode of transportation. Always on schedule and relaxing. Checking the Amtrak website I see this normally prompt arrival time is going to be an hour late. Oh ok I can deal with that.

We'll pickup where we left off 2 years ago on the other side of Bear Mtn at the CT/MASS line. Barely hitting the high spots in the road Hudson drives us up the back roads to a side path near Mt Frizzle. It has rained and left a wet trail but it is warm. Sure hope this trip doesn't turn out like last year and we become drowned rats. He wishes us well and gives us advice on what's to come saying today will be some of the hardest ups of the trip as well as the best views. Watch out for Jug End very steep rock drop off and tough when wet he says. We hope to make it down from there before next storm hits this eve and be stealth camped in the fields around Shays Rebellion, a monument head stone in honor of a small town protest against taxation during the 1700s. Pack feeling good I feel good. Up the side trail and shortly we intersect with the AT just steps from where we got off last time. Perfect. No white blazes missed. A hiker pops out on the other side of another trail, Snickers. He is doing an out and back section covering some big miles. Hope he makes it ok after all them cigarette stops. Yep every time we leap frogged one another he was on a smoke break. Moving slow my group has some training to catch up on. Not many hiking miles done by my kiddos and Jim's long distance prevents only so many training hikes together. I can only hope my gym time pays off.Hiking down to Sages Ravine was like Rock Castle Gorge but easier. Then wow did it open up to the vast edges of Race Mountain. Skirting along the cliffs a mere slip of the foot could send you for quite the fall. Glad it is overcast sun and no rain here. Tricky. The walk goes on for a good quarter mile on open rock before cutting back to tree cover. You got to go down to go back up and thats what the ATC seems to love. Mt Everett next, our highest point today 2600 feet. All rock and why not throw in some rain for added difficulty. Creeping up step by step a thru-hiker closes in. In a blink of an eye he is to me and past. 'What's your trail name?' My name is Everett and THIS is MY mountain. Pressing on for the upcoming shelter we elect for a late lunch and hopes of drying out a bit. Cooler temps make for chilly bumps in the shade so we dart for any sunshine peeking thru the trees around Hemlocks Shelter.There are 2 hikers here. At first we think they are a couple but later find out one is heading south for a bit and the chick is going to Katahdin having started in Pawling NY, been out about a week now. Lunch comes and goes and we decide to just about pack up when another rainstorm rolls in. After some consideration we decide best to hold up here for the night. Who would have known what hiker bonds would be developed and good times to come....Settled in for the night we have our wet clothes hung up to only faintly dry by morning. We get to know our shelter buddies. Both are pretty new to the trail. Pilgrim is packed pretty heavy and asks many beginner questions. Hey we all been there. Bones the quite girl next door type doesn't say much but we do discover she just decided to hike a portion of the trail to 'get out of her comfort zone'. The other option was to go to Costa Rica and learn surfing for her 12week leave from her job as a physicians assistant. Sure hope she likes her choice.Well it's time for our push up challenge folks. Anna and I made a pact New Years to start doing push ups and see how many we could do come this big hiking trip. No time for talk now...its push up or shut up. Bones does the count off and Anna caps out at 30. I've been working hard to come out on top and made the next 5 to finish at 35. Very proud of us even after a day of hiking. Later that night in the loft she says hey I can do more and pops off another 15 to show me she is still younger than I and got more in her. This girl is down for the count. A final hiker comes in at dark, Blue Collar. Older fella, retired and in great shape. Packed light and eating avocado, triskets and cheese. Says he carries 20pounds max and never packs much food eating his way to each town. I gotta learn that. Rain peppers on down.

With doing sections there’s always that little stress of getting in what’s planned in order to meet that train ride back home.Clouds part for a sunny day. We’ll have to put our wet clothes back on, they didn’t dry at all last night. Chilly!!! Bones and Pilgrim are a bit reluctant to give this a go but see us doing it and go with the flow. He is hiking south so we give him our take on yesterday’s terrain and to be careful going down what we just climbed up. Bones is packed and ready to roll so falls in with us.Descending down Jug End was just like Dragon’s Tooth mixed with a little Tinker Cliffs. Awesome rock ledges with views over the state. Glad we are doing this while dry. Steep descent with every foot hold counting.Coming into South Egremont Road we take the time to kick off our shoes and let them dry a bit in the sunshine. Flat farm land surrounds us. We could have stealth camped here but beside a road could have made for a protest by the local authorities. A monument dated 1787, Shay’s Rebellion, was just across the road in recognition of Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays who led four thousand rebels in rising up against perceived economic injustices by Massachusetts. Speaking of an uprising….Bones is a doctor, hence the trail name, so why not have her take a look at my side. I had a small mosquito type bit on my stomach before I even got on the trail and during the train ride up got a little redder and irritated. By now with wearing my pack it has spread out to a patch about the size of a deck of cards. Hey Doc what do you think this is? Immediate exam determines I have cellulitis!! You calling me fat girl? Bones’ eyes get big and Jim stands back to make sure a cat fight isn’t breaking out…Laughing at myself I say man I got all kinds of cellulitis just look around!!! Not knowing my sense of humor Bones is quick to retract her statement and clarify that this is a skin infection and might out to get some antibiotics before long. Needless to say I we joked about my FAT for most of the day and the trip!!Mile after mile we push for another road crossing at Great Barrington. We hear there is a hot dog place down the road and are looking forward to a good lunch. Bones was supposed to hold up at Tom Leonard Shelter but we talk her into heading on with us. Besides there’s porcupines in them woods. Yes you heard me correct. These rascals eat the shelter entrances and get up inside if shelter steps not high enough. Reaching the road we venture down to a local garden center store and quiz them about our food stop. They are closed and other options are miles on down the road. We agree to eat what we packed and enjoy the shade trees and yard art at their store. A hiker we met on the way off the mountain had run into town and is now being dropped back off, RidgeRambler. GA Tech boy who started in Feb who’s rolling with the miles and mind over matter type attitude. Not wanting to get in to the shelter way too late we pack on up and head out. We have already decided that Mt Wilcox South will be our stop instead of Mt Wilcox North. With making up miles today’s trip will be close to 20. That’s enough for me. Ridge Rambler leads the way getting to know the rest of our group while Bones and I bring up the rear. Not more than a few hundred yards Bones shouts out that she is going to drop off back to town. She has been out for 7 days and really wanting a shower and refresher. So we trade Bones for the Rambler and only hope our paths will cross again. Glad to have the Rambler in the lead he pushes us to our limits. Walking in his crocs due to swollen feet he still kicks my arss climbing The Ledges, our last pull before closing in on our shelter. Time now O’Dark 30. Starting at 7:00am and soon to be 8:30pm we’ve been hiking for over 13 hours. Now that’s a day’s work. He calls out we’re at the shelter and makes the turn up the side path. Too tired to hardly raise my head I don’t see the sign which maps out the location of shelterS and water. Note plural. Rambler jumps back, a porcupine!!! It’s up in the shelter. I can’t see it so I start whooping and clicking my sticks. Whooop Whoop, Click click click shooo you porcupine !!! Anna and TJ hollar from below, stop making fun you are up there already Martha. Laughing off our scared Jim says I’ll protect you fradicats by cowboying up. We’ll leave the shelter to the critter.19.7 miles hiked and a pile of food in our bellies we hit the tents hoping for no visits from Mr. Pins and Needles. Chuckling in the dark Rambler informs us there is a NEW shelter just beyond this one and we could have slept there. SON OF A…….","Hemlocks Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502472,"Slept pretty good in my new tent even with one eye open for the porcupine. Didn’t have any more sightings either. Guess Jimmy’s cowboy camping did keep him at bay. I rustle my troops a little earlier this morning so we can get going and not have to roll into town at dark. Yes I have planned a scheduled stop at a motel/lodge early in this trip. Too close to pass up and we can shower a little more often than last year. We still have a few miles to make up so today’s 15.6 just became 17.4. We also have already discussed busting out a bigger day tomorrow so we can have a full zero in Dalton on Saturday.Ridge Rambler has been good for us, helping lead the pack and talking all the way makes for quick miles and happy times. Good to meet these fellas along the way. I have already heard from some of last year’s gang when they read about our trip back up north. Texaco, Grasshopper and Calamity Jane all of which we hiked with in NJ/NY. Nice to know they remember us too.Trail not too bad today with rolling ups and down but hot baby hot. Nice to be back in the ferns and woods that resemble home. Newts, flowers and fields along the way. Feet feeling great however I do have a black ass bruise on my bootie from a hard fall from day one. TJ has been nursing his bad blisters but has been a trooper with nary a complaint. Our shoes go from muddy soaked to dried and stinky 2 or 3 times a day. Thank goodness for the board walks that are out here or we’d be knee deep in it.Already planning a zero for Saturday has me drumming up a slack pack for tomorrow. Why not do the whole 19 miles left to town instead of 16 and then 3 in. Jim as already made it clear town is happening if he gets in the lead and why not make it easier on ourselves. I’ll get a number from the lodge for a local that I’m sure provides this service. On the phone I make arrangements with Shamrock to expect us a day early as well.Once again here we are following along the Housatonic River and coming up on the famous Upper Goose Pond Cabin. It was tempting to go see it but being a ½ mile off the trail we just couldn’t do it. Hate to miss the free pancakes made by the caretaker and a canoe ride but that ½ mile puts us closer to pizza and a shower. Following ol Rambler believe me a shower is a good thing. Heard he tried to wash his clothes by hand the last stop and didn’t get time to finish so he put on damp and man have they fermented. Good trail and good times and before we know it we’re at the US 20, Lee. Rambler has to go into town tomorrow and get a package sent to him from REI. New sticks and shoes to come later. Jim and I invite him to eat pizza with us and stay. Not wanting a hotel expense he plans to camp back along the trail after refreshments. I had already lined up adult beverages to be waiting on us in our hotel room and my girls here have come thru for me. Thanks Diana and Michelle. How much pizza is enough? Try three 52 inch big boys. Long Trail goes down gooood. Cashless and full is the way to go. Well I had some cash but when Hudson said cash only at Bearded Woods my mouth dropped open. I always collect all funds from the group and pay by card. Easier and make reservations quick too. So he tapped me out. Glad my bunch had my back. So I’ll have to address my empty pockets and possibly a pharmacy when we hit town tomorrow. Bones had recommended the antibiotic for my cellulitis so I plan to call my drs office for a call in prescription once I get close to Dalton.Phoning our shuttle guy we have him lined up to pick up our gear in the morning and deliver to the Shamrock INN in Dalton. Hope they don’t assume it is trash as we have left gear in our liner trash compactor bags pulled from inside our packs. Funny you just call up a complete stranger, pay him a few dollars and give him all your belongings and walk away. It’s really that simple out here. Trust and honesty.

Miles are miles and I’ve seen all the white blazes just like the thru-hikers. I’ve sectioned hiked all the AT that I have walked so I guess all my day trips are in this category. So today why not lighten the load on this long trip no and get my slack packin on. Pizza is the only thing weighing my pack down. I have 7 pieces to get me thru the day. Think it will? Jim is only carrying his food back as a day pack while TJ and Anna share one of their packs. Their plan is TJ carry on the up and then Anna carry on the down. Think they will?A hiker we met at Bearded Woods is up with us again now too. Shay, he left out early this morning to get miles in and met his folks for his slack pack over Greylock. Supposed to be raining in a day or so and he wants to get it in while he can. He is from MASS and has given us all his trail advice for our upcoming section. Flat Flat is the report once on October Mtn and just a few bogs. Finally good trail is in sight. Becket Mtn is our first pull and I’m feeling fine to Lead us out of Lee. We crush it traveling light and before we know it we have 9 miles down and rolling into Pittsfield/Becket and the infamous Cookie Lady. Story is she fixing cookies and leaves for the hikers by her house. Now to find her house. By instinct we turn right and walk down the road to a yellow house that looks abandoned but has a sign out front EGGS. Gotta be the place. I walk down the dirt drive way to another barn type house and see an AT sticker. This is it guys, look instructions to sign in on a clip board. An old man pops around the corner of the garage while I read and see a familiar name at the bottom of the rules sheet, Roy and Marilyn. Hey that’s the guy I called about our gear shuttle. Sure enough cookie lady is delivering our stuff right now while Roy hands off a basket of little chocolate chip rounds of goodness. Surrounded by blueberry bushes the place is a spot to dream of. You can work for stay, mow some grass or pick some berries when in season. We just missed that and boy I’d sure mow to stay here and visit with Roy. An airplane runway sets in the back yard, grown up a bit but still flight ready. He hasn’t flown in some time but still has his credentials. Harry you gotta come here. And for Marilyn, she’s been making cookies for hiker over 30 years. Makes about 2000 cookies per year Roy says, baking 150 at a time and freezing them for quick serve. What a treasure!!!Time is ticking so we gotta go. Jim takes the lead to get a quick 3 miles in before the next hour. We see good flat trail and push baby push it. It’s all I can do to keep up walking so fast I burned up to small blisters on the tips of my toes digging for traction. October Mountain was lovely with the ferns and grass lined trail. Warner Hill was the high point with a view near the end of the day giving us a peek of Mt Greylock. We had stopped at a dirt road crossing just shy of the hill for a quick break and time for me to contact my Dr back home for those antibiotics. Two locals chatted with us and told about getting snowed out on the hill and not being able to find the way. I did notice most of the blazes up here are way high on the trees. Not eye level like down south. Anyways I call the dr’s office and explain that my personal physician on the trail Dr. BONES say I have cellulitis and I need Keflex. All I get is “seek immediate urgent care right away”. Yeah right lady I’m still 9 miles from town and they only have a local pharmacy. Just let me talk to the nurse and get some meds for this “bug bit”. No can do, “this is a recording” is what I basically got. Laughing it off I decide I’ll just stay FAT and keep walking. The last 3 miles into town was long. We could hear town but just couldn’t see to reach it. Then the trail turned nasty black mud with not maintenance or water bars. Quite frustrating at the end of a 19 mile day. But all was fine once we saw the blazes on the street poles.","Berkshire Lakeshore Lodge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502970,"Trying out a Zero. Never heard of it? It’s when a hiker takes a full day off the trail and does Zero miles. You wash your clothes, take a shower, EAT, sleep, Eat some more, resupply and charge not only your phone but recharge your body. We arrived in town last evening under good time after our slackpack. Our gear was waiting for us in our room along with a supplied frig with our leftover beverages from the day before. Thanks to Marilyn Wiley (cookie lady) and Laura here at the rock. Clothes hit the washing machines and we hit the showers. Ahhh felt good. Now let’s find the bar and get some grub.Jacobs was the place to be, a local scene with a jukebox waiting for a $20 and bro country to sound out the place. Slim Jim dialed them up and TJ drummed along. Kick Tiny Pants. Food filled 2 high top tables we sat at. Wings and things, suds and buds. A dart game broke out and we took over the little corner all evening. Rain poured down all the while and we cheered cause we was here and not out there. Still on hiker time we didn’t stay out too long. Hiker mid-night still strikes once you’ve been out for a few days and our weary bodies told us it was time to turn in.The next morning we slept in and then headed down to The Dalton Restaurant for a big breakfast. Next on the list was to see the pharmacist and get some cash in my pocket. I am without my personal physician, Boneless as Jimmy would say. She gave me her diagnosis and I will relay this to O’Laughins. Nothing like visiting the mom and pop stores for quick carrying service. Step right over her miss and lift up your shirt tail so I can see. Since my home physician couldn’t help at all, go seek Urgent Care, I am at the mercy of the man. I checked out with Benadryl in all forms and another topical ointment. This is gonna blow my weight limit for my medical kit. The spot is quite red and purple looking from the heat and has spread to the size of a average cell phone. Your Pin Entry has Exceeded its limits. WHAT? Cashless I remain. I tried two ATMs and they didn’t like me. Calling my bank for support they are as helpful as they can be over the long distance, cell break up and dropped calls. I will get a reset PIN in the mail. Now isn’t that nice since I’m in Massachusetts and my mail is going to be in VA. Oh well who needs green backs.RidgeRambler blew into town for a bit. He had the last piece of pizza rolled up in my food bag for a snack and we gave him some of our leftover supplies not needed since we slacked to town. Not wanting another town expense he rolled on out. Then we get a checkin from our girl Bones. She is pushing to do a 20 mile day to catch up with us. At a girl, you hike it baby. Arriving at 6 we have a cold beer waiting for her. All the while we have made other friends with 2 other hiker gals who are sectioning, both from Alaska. Chuckles is an elementary teacher AND raises sled dogs. Had as many as a 100 to keep up. Put that on a TV show!! She also is the aunt to Boston Red Sox baseball player, Mike Napoli. Jimmy was ecstatic. Her hiking friend, Tag A Long, also a teacher was quite the newbie to the trail but giving it her best in borrowed gear. Now that we have our who gang here lets slam the door one more time at Jacobs and show then what we still have in us. Being a Saturday eve the parking lot was full but we still got our round tables by the jukebox and fired it up one last time. Food, Suds and Buds. I think we should schedule these zero’s more often.","Dalton MA, Shamrock Village Inn

Having one last shower that will have to do for the next 5 days we get a tasty breakfast from Juice and Java around the corner. Glad we didn’t pile in the food like we did at The Dalton or I don’t think I could have carried my pack. It is now reloaded with food supplies for this next section and man do I wish it was back to that 20 pound weight. Doesn’t help that I have a full Gatorade And those left over hotwings from last night. I do love me some wings and they will taste good come second breakfast or first lunch depends on how you look at it. I have celery and ranch too!!The sun pours down on us walking up the pavement heading out of town. My legs feel a little heavy at first but get some life once we hit the shades of the woods. The trail is great no standing water or mean roots. With a 14 mile day ahead we feel better about our day. Nothing too big except our up out of Cheshire. This will put us over half way thru the day and the next town walk thru, in approach of Mount Greylock. We’ll see it tomorrow. The weather is supposed to get bad between tonight and tomorrow. Sure hope we get a look of the big monument on the top of Greylock. Its name sound mid evil to me and I picture a castle with a mote. Back to Lead Doggin I felt good and strong. The team is powering up too. I can tell any one of us can take the lead and push us onward and upward. Looking forward to Diane’s Twist, an ice cream place in Cheshire, we could hardly walk fast enough. Reaching The Cobbles was a treat just prior to town. Finally an overlook, open and wide over the Hoosic River Valley. Mt Greylock stands towering above, our miles to come. A little granny lady ran the ice cream shop. A small house right on the trail, even had a hiker log to sign in. She scooped us up and we left with smiles. Resting in the lawn we chatted with bikers coming and going from the adjacent rails to trail path. Diane’s does do the business. I even went back in for a deli samich to pack out for my supper tonight. I can have half when I get to camp and the other half for second supper!! She fixed me up good too, extra chips and a pickle, mayo on the side to keep it fresh. Now the walk out of any town is hard. Always down going in and up leaving. But this time we had some field walking which I just loved. Knee hair green grass with a path cut just wide enough for our shoes. Large farm houses sparsely dotted the mountain sides, some with barns as big as a mini mall. Horse country I’d guess since I saw nary a cow. Our five mile up to our shelter was a hot walk. Sure hope the sun holds for a bit longer as the clouds begin to gather some more with our elevation gain. We will gain nearly 1750 feet this eve and still have close to 800 more in the morning to reach Greylock.Coming into the last mile and half push a thru hiker catches us, Hook. He started April 28. Yes and is already here. Packed light and dressed like a trail runner he is making 30+ miles a day walking from sun up to sundown. Carries a bar of soap to wash his feet every night. No need to keep anything else fresh he says except the one thing that gets you to Maine. He leads us up the tight twisting trail now to our shelter. He is headed on for Bascom Lodge, a place just past the Greylock. You can spend the night and they have a dining room. We shall hit that for a brunch tomorrow. I packed less in hopes to eat hardy there.Smoke puffs from a small fire at the shelter which is tucked tight on the side of the mountain, nestled in trees and protected against with winds I am sure. A group of fellows are here all friends out for a section, 2 from Maine, 2 from PA and 1 from Louisiana. I am glad we have arrived at 6 instead of 8:30. We have daylight and time to do chores. No camping tonight since rain in expected and at 100% now. And we already know what that means buckets. We take the loft with more than enough room for 5. Bones is now one of us, the Va Gang.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503100,"Rain began about 9pm last night and then dumped at 4:30am. In the loft I felt like it was going to come thru the roof but it was sound tight. An air hole had been bored just by the side and I fully expected the rain to spout in sideways from the sounds during the night. Some of our shelter companions had friends tenting and one was in a hammock. Bet the water was running under him this morning.Cellphones turn-on as folks begin to check the weather and when the rain is to move on or increase. Looks like 10 or so, we turn over to get a few more winks while the party below begins packing up and taking their chances. We have 3.6 miles to reach the summit of Greylock and the lodge. Yes the lodge, it will give us shelter and a hot meal. We can then make our next move accordingly. We batten down the hatches on all our gear, rain jackets go on and pack covers. Anna and I decide hiking in our underwear is the plan. Don’t worry mom I didn’t show my ass. Boy short tights work well and I usually have them as my underwear to keep those hot spots from working up in the nether regions. This trip I have had good fortune with Exofficio girly undies and my soccer shorts. I’d like to keep them dry and decide the sleek underoos will work well if we have to walk in rain all day. Anna agrees and packs away her skirt for another day. Time to step out in it……RIVER that’s all I have to say. The trail was a river. No water bars. No maintenance except patches of board walk that left you literally walking on water. Don’t walk to fast or you’ll bust a hump. Roots and rocks gave you a tippy toe step if you had the balance to try. Moose Maple, ah I hate this stuff. It grows all along the trail up here and I always in conjunction with BAD trail. Grows thick over the ground cover, branches spouting about with hand sized leaves holding all the water fallen for you to brush up against and get a good cleaning like a car wash. Everything on us exposed is now wet. Glad the temps are cold or it could be very bad.Talk of hot clam chowder or a soup begins to take over our thoughts. I had cut myself short of food today with anticipation of eating INSIDE. A breakfast bar and no extra lunch packed. Bones leads us up into the thicker clouds. Signs guide us to the summit as we cross the paved road a couple of times that tourist can drive up. Wind blasts us from side to side as we break from balsam tree cover. Bare legs get cold quick when that happens let me tell ya, Especially when wet. A massive structure can barely be seen a mere hundred yards in front of us, the monument of Mt Greylock. Stands tall like the Washington Monument in DC, the shape of a towering and thin pawn chess piece. Now ya see it now ya don’t with the weather blowing by. We scurry for cover at the front door. I pull the handle and rush in to only find it locked and ram my face into the door, all others behind follow suite and we stack up ontop of one another like a lunch room line of kindygardens running for the ice cream. I look in the windows, dark. A voice hollers from above, no it wasn’t GOD, but rather a worker up on a telephone pole. Hey they are closed on Mondays. You’ve got to be kidding!!Darting back in an alcove to the building side we stand in bewilderment. Nothing left to do but have a snack and move on. We’ll get too chilled waiting at the elevation too long. Getting a photo was just for old time sake to show just how bad it was and I don’t think you’ll find a smile. Heart broke and bent out of shape I fall to the rear. Jim leads us trying to find a damn white blaze. How could a place so touristy not have a well-marked path? Too flipping cold now to be making mistakes and back tracking too. Bones GPS’s just to make sure and we have our right coordinates. Let’s get low.All the miles we went up yesterday we’ll have to descend today and all in this creek. Talk begins will we have time to reach our scheduled shelter tonight, 16.5 miles. We got a late start. It’s gonna be Hard Times but we vote to keep hiking. I hate to get behind schedule, not me saying it this time but Tiny Pants and I second that. Bones has her own dilemma with a friend trying to come meet her for a hike along. When to meet him and where and it’s bad trail and more rain expected. 9+ miles in we reach North Adams and walk down thru this town. Should she stay or should she go? No comments from you Judgemental Jim, Bones turns to me. What do you think I should do? Heck girl it’s enough to take care of yourself out here, bringing on another might be quite to task and besides you need a break as you said to freshen up. She really didn’t want to do this big day either. We pondered a pull up short camp spot but with it only having tent sites we vote for the shelter. Do you got another 6 miles in ya? Bones turns for a hotel. We keep following the blazes 4:00pm.Anna takes a chance that the rain is over and the trail is not soup. Puts on fresh dry socks. Hiking up to the tent spots we have first supper. Let’s recharge and hike out of here by 5:30 that will put us at Seth Warner about 8:30 or so. Darkness doesn’t set in till 9:30 we hope.Some spot of light give me a pick me up and most of all the next few miles will get us out of Mass and we hit the Vermont line!!! But first we must climb this boulder field. Yes a massive rock mess with white blazes leading us up and over. Hard Times!Ridge walk yes let’s make some time. Darting up and down the puds our excitement to reach the VT heightens with every step. Gotta get to that line before dark. Also here is the beginning of the Long Trail which runs from the Vermont border up to Canada. NO NO not more bogs. Dark begins to set in. Where’s the sign? Should be just past this side trail. TJ, should we put on our head lamps yet? There I see it. We made it guys. Hell I’ll camp right here if we have too. 7:00pm Maybe an two hours. Hugging the Line we get out group photo, put on headlamps and kick it up.Hope this shelter isn’t full, Yeah right. Forecast maybe rain, its dark, no worries we’ll tent if we have too. Hunger has really set in now too. Ok fine I’ll be cooking at 9:30 but who cares. Where is that shelter sign, our head lamps shine all around.Lights, I smell smoke, we are close. Look at all the tents, this place is crawling with people.O Dark Thirty! Look there is only 4 in here. We are sheltering move over folks. One guy is reading all in their bags. Lights out. Hey guys this shelter holds 8, they have stuff everywhere. Here Anna you and TJ can fit between these 2. They don’t move. Reading guy moves closer to the wall, Jim and I will squeeze in between him and snoring guy. Anna goes straight to bed only eating some peanut butter I think. Hiking 11 hours. What a day. Jim and TJ have their pots boiling before I an even get my shoes off. The shelter is shit and no picnic table, we cook setting on the ground, log under butt. Hamburger crumbles, A-1 and instant potatoes is my meal. Hell I eat my crumbles cold, drizzled with sauce while my pot comes to a boil. Scarfing down food, hanging up packs and making our beds as quietly as we can is hard when tired. You just don’t care, you wanna go to bed.

Jim doesn’t move in hopes I will remain sound and in place. Yes Lead dog is tired as a dog and plans to sleep in a bit more this morning. Besides it’s a short day.Our shelter companions began packing up while we stayed tucked in and out of the way. Besides it was still drizzling and with no overhang or picnic table here at the primitive shelter working space was sparse. We do learn the leader did hike the AT a few years back is now taking this 4some up the Long Trail. Note the Long Trail and the AT coincide from the Mass line we pasted last night up a ways in Vermont then they split off. The Long Trail continues on to the Canada line, 272 total miles. It is the oldest trail in the United States. Humm sounds like a path that we must come back and finish after the AT. Heck we’ll already have half of it walked.Bones gave us her GPS tracking but with no cell service we aren’t sure where she is. Wonder if her friend is meeting her or if she has even thought about leaving town to catch back up with us. We did discuss a County Road just past the shelter she could get ride back into. Eating my left over potatoes from last night was good. Yes I ate them cold with some dried fruit. I need much more but that all allotted for right now. I can’t afford to eat my lunch this early and come up short then. Lead Dog is Hungry Dog.Leaving at 9am we’ll make our night’s stop by 6 for sure, taking our lunch break at the next shelter, Congdon, where these guys are hiking to for their day. Short trippers getting their legs.Drizzles fall, heads down off we go. Boggy wet trail, what’s new. Nothing really to brighten our day until movement, bright orange, green…what’s that? It’s Bones!!! Her orange rain jacket and lime green pack cover make spotting her a synch. Oh and don’t forget her green rain skirt too. All 90 pounds of her and 30 of that is her pack weight. I am just getting dropped off by my taxi she says. “Hey you guys slept in. Thought I was gonna have to play catch up.” I give her a big hug. She smells like a box of TIDE, heavenly. Since you’re all sugar and spice why don’t you lead the way and we’ll bask in your aroma instead of our own. What a roller coaster today with weather. We’d get dried out and then it would drizzle rain or the trail would turn good and then bad. Sun peeked and disappeared. Having lunch was a toss up to eat quick or just set in the drizzle and enjoy. We did the latter. Finally Harmon Hill gave way to pretty good trail then a bitch showed up with rock steps down to Bennington VT 9. Oh and why not dump some rain to make it more treacherous. Coming in and out of a rain jacket wasn’t an option by now, just get wet and keep walking. My knees ouched with every step down the slick rocks, 900 feet worth. Reaching the road we look around for the trail, see a parking area and then a forest service pot privy. Darting into it for shelter from the now monsoon we become real close with one another and the Throne. Luckily it had a lid and wasn’t frequented to cause our demise. Should we stay or should we go? Give it to 4:30 Jim says and it not gone we’ll head out. Standing wet I’m ready to walk just the same who cares at this point. Letting up the rain breaks away to bright blue skies and we hope the worst is finally over. Climbing out of a town once again is hard. Sunny and now in a sauna we are. Maybe we can walk ourselves dry again. I get us up half way with a steady pace to Split Rock but I am burnt clean out. Take the wheel Jim, lead us to that shelter man. A nice stream leads to our home for the night. Sun shines so maybe we can dry something out before night falls. Suppose to be clear for the next day or so. A few other guys are here. Genius/Gonzo from Mass just getting started heading north and 3 other local boys out for a good time over the next few days. We take our spots on bunks and then another thru-hiker shows up, 10Speed from Switzerland. All bunks taken, he says he’ll sleep on the floor under the kids and Bones. Shelter holds 8. Local boys take one side, top and bottom bunk. Kids and Bones on bottom bunk our side with me and Genius on top bunk. Jim takes one for the team and cowboy camps. Our first night in a while to really visit with ourselves and new friends was nice. We are settling in to a routine now too so makes it easier feel the part so to speak. Dusk rolls over and its hiker midnight. The local boys take their evening fun on down in the woods to another fire pit and enjoy the rest of their night. Genius joins them, he is young. I’ll make his bunk so when he comes in he won’t be waking us. 10speed slides in under us all. Goood dunight, in his thick foreign ascent, shall I deflate this persons mat? Just head poking out from under he reaches up to pull the plug on Bones. Giggles and snorts then our shelter turns to snores.","Seth Warner Shelter

Ahhh wish I was in my tent right now but this will have to do. Jim still curled tight in his sleeping bag while the morning rests with him. Peaceful. 10 Speed crawls from his trap and stretches out his long limbs. The local boys and Genius don’t move. We pack up quietly, eat and start our day. Another short one with a mostly graded up for all day. Hope we have some ridge walking soon to view out. I miss my valleys in VA. Maples and ferns begin to line the trail. YES, no more Moose Maple. Trail seems better maintained now too. We must have entered a new corridor of workers as they have done a great job here. No water stands in the trail and we can actually stride and walk normal. Our only real obstacle of the day was Hell Hollow Brook. Sounds scary. We walked up to a rolling creek with a big sign across the front of a bridge saying, Bridge Closed. Seems sound. A small note rests on the steps, Troop 75. “we crossed, go one at a time.” Green light for us. Jim takes lead and says he’ll cross and then go down stream “in case she goes down and I’ll rescue you”. I send the little people next. Best to get the majority across instead of Big Dawg taking it out first. Everyone is over and my turn. Thinking about running I decide best to take a quick steady step and not bounce this structure too much. Safely across we head for our various “lookouts” noted on the map. Again Finally we can see out. The mountains of Vermont reveal themselves just a peek at a time. The day warms and I’m feeling the best about our trip yet. I have my clothes drying on the top of my pack, fresh socks on, and a smile a mile wide on my face.The Green Mountains surround us and we are on the top. Glastenbury Wilderness I love you. We are at the tree line tops, short lushness abounds. Blue skies just a reach away. Good trail under foot with only a few black vermud spots. Not sure how far we’ve come we chat with local southbounders. You can tell those that are out only a night or so. They are fresh looking and usually just leaving camp when we meet them close to noon. They tell us the firetower is close. Can’t wait to lookout, hope I can stand to go up in it. I’m a fradie cat!Jim is already talking about a grassy field he expects this tower to be in. He’ll soak up the sun and dry his gear over an hour long lunch. Hey now that sounds like a plan. The trail gives us a push past Goddard Shelter, which by the way was a great place for camp. Faced the noon sun, water source right by it and neat as a pin. Hard woods turn to pine forest, tall and thick with just needles covering the ground. A patch cut back just for the tower to stand. We drop our packs and Jim is already half way up the tower before I can take off my shoes. Now the surroundings aren’t as lush as you might envision. No grass just those pine needles and dirt since these pines have shaded out all. The wide open cut out has leaves a direct line for the sun to heat up this spot and NO wind. You know what they means? Black Flies. Yikes. They have engulfed anything standing still. I try to ignore them, have my mat stretched out for lunch and some sunshine. The others are eewwwing and slapping. Get the bug spray out. What happened to my relaxing lunch?Nothing left to do but get up this tower and what a treat it was. The best view of the trip thus far. 3750 feet elevation plus whatever this tower measures to be, we are looking over it all. Greylock from which we came, Stratton Mountain soon to summit. We all just quickly ate and wanted to move on. With only 4 miles left in the day we’ll eat twice when we arrive at the shelter anyways. Jim and Bones lead the way off with Anna close by. I take sweeper to enjoy this great terrain a bit more. Arriving at Kid Gore shelter fairly early we have rule of the roost. Picking our bunks but saving room for other we pair up on spots with Jim taking a single side of a top bunk above me and Bones. A prime shelter spot looking out over Snow Mtn and Pond Reservoir. We’ll watch the sunset and rise from here for the first time of our journey. More hikers come in thru the late eve. 2 local kids out for few days heading to the same shelter tomorrow as us. Then 2 thru-hikers, Not Yet and Ox. Ox is from Dallas and stays in the shelter with us. Big reddish beard, quite guy attune to his religion and theory. Teaches at a monastery school out for a walk. I bet he ate for an hour once he settles in. Not Yet took a prime tent spot out on the edge of this wide open cut of trees. It was like he was on his own island. TJ get the fire going again and we clothes line everything to air out. Things are getting ripe after 4 days out and we still have one more to go before our town stop in Manchester Center. Look who’s coming here.. Genius. Yep the young lad from last night. Green as the come to hiking but knows some survival skills, he was in the military I believe he said. Not quick bright, hence his name put on him. He’ll take the bunk spot with Jim. Our house is full now. Let’s toast to a great day on the trail, watch the sunset and thank God we are here.","Mark Nauheim Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503416,"Sleepless SlimJim. Sun rises early up her in the north, 4:35am. Peeking from my bag I look for a spectacular sunrise that just never really materializes. Pink skies at night Sailors Delight, Pink of morning Sailors heed warning. We did have those pinks last night. Shades of pink this morning but mostly the orange ball trying to peer over these washed out mountains. Sun rise just not like down south. Looking hard to figure what or who is on the picnic table outside I realize that someone had come in last night and slept outside. My eyes trying to focus I put on my glasses to get a better look. Heck that’s Jim. His bunk buddy snored in his ear all night. Jim had turned in early than most and guess was looking for a silent night. Not easy to do in a shelter but we do all try. Genius must have turned his volume up and kept Jim awake to the point he had to get out. A normal light sleeper I never heard a sound. That tells you how tired I’ve become.Packing up I can tell Jim isn’t his normal talkative self. No sleep is not a good combination out here. Your body has to recover or you’ll hit the wall. Trying to hurry everyone along a little more than normal I want to get us rolling in case Jim does need a long break in the day. Bones scrambles to get her stuff packed up. Where’s my knife? Looking hastily it can’t be found close by so the search ventures out to the privy from which she had just come. Just last eve her rain skirt went missing and was found balled up beside the entrance trail to the shelter. Reminds me of “get your shit together Thomas” when I lost my water spout mouth piece in a down pour in Jersey. Jim discovers the knife beside the trail to the privy and huddles Bones along to the trail junction where I am getting water for us all. A 15 mile day with Stratton mtn in front of us seems daunting. Another 3900 foot summit. Let’s hope for good weather. We have a chance of rain coming again this eve so let’s get her done.Reaching Story Spring Shelter we’ve come a good 4 ½ miles and plan to break the day down in 5 mile increments. Jim still not in good humor is ready to break away from whatever has him in this funk. I got to go! He says. Looking over my maps for quick reference he doesn’t take time to rest just keeps his head down and disappears around the corner. TJ’s looking to have a little coffee for a pick me up and I too am hungry. Snack time begins and Not Yet comes in to join us. Take the lead Smalls show us to our next stop, International Paper Road. Her paces pushing me to walk faster on the down and we make good time. We are carrying little water to save weight. Let’s not reload till we reach the top of Stratton, a water source shows on the map. Not Yet comes past us once again while we have our lunch and we guess this will be the last we see of him. Bones takes close look at the map and show this paper road is a direct line to our shelter tonight. Say we can be there in an hour guys? I hear the question mark in her voice to entice us to give this a go! Gotta get those white blazes in girl. Let’s climb this mountain.Anna steps back on leading us up and I take over again giving us a steady pace upward. What great trail. Hope these long level switchbacks keep coming. And they do. Before we know it the water source is reached just shy of the summit. Let’s reload guys. Temps much cooler up here too. What a beautiful climb, foliage just thick enough to seem comforting and the trees so green in every shade it was magical. Cresting the top a trail member is in a forest shed. Say do you need to pay you here? This section has a $5 fee for staying in the various shelters. Help pay for this wonder trail I hope. A voice answers back no, the caretakers aren’t out here yet. We are early enough in the season to miss them. She says the AT was originated here on Stratton Mountain. Benton Mackaye is said to have envisioned the AT at this very spot. Sprinkles begin to fall, hurry let’s get up in this tower before it clouds over. Views aren’t as grand as Glastenbury but still vast. But boy was it windy. Glad this on is glassed in. I don’t hang around long, up and down in a flash. With this elevation I check my phone for service and good thing I did. Mom’s calling and has been for the last 3 days. We’ve been secluded and she aint happy about me not reaching out to touch her. No worries mom, we still hiking, my side is healing and TJ’s feet are too. Jimmy’s jumped ship to port a little sooner than us today. Our Dr is still with us and Anna’s gonna lead us off this mountain before it rains. Our green tunnel is leaving as we descend down. Reminded me of Leconte in TN. Smell of spruce fills the air. Rocky coble path but very walkable with little switchbacks on the south side. Less than 3 miles from the shelter Anna turns up the pace. Again I take my time a little more than the youth with Bones settling in between us. She is pretty light on her feet too but takes care over uneven trail. Sure hope Jim has made it to the shelter and resting. Sure wouldn’t want to find him on the trail side covered in duff.Where ya’ll been? I hear a voice. That’s Jimmy. He has come down the trail a bit just shy of the junction to Stratton Pond. We been hiking man just like you. We arrived at 4:00 right on schedule. And just in time too. The skies are darkening and rain is soon to fall.He shows us to our quarters, the loft, YES. This 16 person sleeper has 2 stories and bunk beds along the walls, big covered porch with sets and picnic table. We meet Flo, BB and Gi-Jo all hiking the Long Trail. BB is quite to talker now. Jim has to remain silent most of the time prior to his arrival but is settling in nicely now that pleasantries have been made. Let’s go Skinny dipping!! No that wasn’t out of my mouth but rather these crazy ladies. Noni where are you? We might have found our match. They say the water is might warm upon return. Other hikers for the evening are Boulder Dash from Nashville hiking a 340 mile section up into Maine. He has already hiked Katahdin and everything else but NY and NJ. He’ll do that next year before he get any older as well. Oh let’s not forget Genius. He rolled in with Brother Louie who has more hair on top of his than anyone I’ve met. Wild black frizzy-hair walloping around in the wind big as an exercise ball. Come gather around my new friends I gotta get a picture of this diverse bunch. Mostly LASHERS = Long Ass Section Hikers. Climbing up to our loft most of us are settling in for the night. Not Flo and BB. There’s stories to be told and card to be played. Shuffling the cards cuts thru the otherwise silence in the shelter. “what the shit was that?” a voice sounds out. Shuffle those cards again and I’ll cut them for ya.Giggles quite to sleeping purrs. 4:30am pop pop pop. Drops of water hit the tin roof. Then all of the heavens open up, gushing water pours down. No early rise for me, I turn back over for the best sleep of the whole trip.","Kid Gore Shelter
",Stratton Pond Shelter,"Jun 18, Thu",15
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503426,"Ben & Jerry’s Here We Come. With the rain pelting this morning the whole place slept in. Only some early weather reports checked. No one started moving till 6am. It’s only 10.7 miles to town so we have all day but want to arrive with time to enjoy it. All us LASHERS are headed for town. We’ll arrive in phases thru-out the day that’s for sure. Thru-hikers plan to hike on for more miles. Rain has left and the trail is in pretty good condition.Thank you trail maintenance once again.Jim leads us out down by the pond and then the trail takes a turn. Hummm white blazes show this way but a side sign shows different. After walking out a bit following the blazes the trail along the pond is totally under water, hence the detour back. About face and regroup. Bones leads us down to another pond area. The place is socked in with dampness. More weekenders are tenting along this area with many trails to access this area. Now I know why a caretaker would be at this big shelter. Could turn into a big party pad. Get them cards out ladies!!!Rolling along nicely until I take a misstep pitching my front inward pulling my arch. Pain shoots into my heel. No No not my plantar fasciitis. It’s the heels heart string that feels like a stepping on a nail. I didn’t hear a pop but boy do I feel this with every step now and we have 5 more miles to go. With no real trail features to distract me the path goes on forever. No rain is good but still very wet out with glimpses of sunshine. Oh how that will make my day. Anxious to reach town we keep looking for the final out to the road. Usually you walk down to town. Seems we’ve turned up. What there’s no up on my maps? The troops get restless.Hearing the highway we know we are close and none too soon. I’ve got true hiker hobble now. Lord just get me across this road to the parking lot before a Mack truck takes me out. One by one we dart across VT 11/30. Cell phones turn on and we hold our arms up trying to get more bars of service. In and out, calls made for rescue. We can’t get thru. Tried to reach local taxis and then Jeff at the hostel. We are almost ready to strap on packs and start the dreaded highway walk some 5 miles to town, sticking our thumbs out for a hitch, when I finally get a voice, “Heeelllo, Green Mtn House, Jeff speaking” Hallelujah. Please come!!Starving, Stinking and Aching, and Smiling…why not throw that in cause it’s so, we jump into Jeff’s rig. Questions and Answers he has for us as we do for him. We’ll go on to the house, order pizza, get laundry going, shower and eat our Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. Not necessarily all in that order. The place is top notch baby. I’d love to come back and make this home base for some day hikes in this area. We have the whole place to ourselves right now. Kitchen stocked with basics for a breakfast in the morning. Jeff will take you to town for resupply and pick you up, which Jim, Bones and TJ take advantage of. Anna and I take care of laundry and I get my foot on ice and propped up. Fresh and clean the place is spotless. Jeff runs a tight ship. Shoes and sticks outside. Wash before you set on furniture. Here are loaner clothes to wear while your laundry finishes and here are your supply boxes. Boy do I wish I was zeroing tomorrow. Our foursome has our own room each with a twin bed and our own bath. Bones will bunk with Boulder Dash. The crazy ladies will have their own room too. Lashers take over Green Mtn House!Once all arrive it’s time for a house meeting. Jeff runs thru the schedule for shuttles tomorrow. Girls going at 7:00 we go at 8:00. Boulder Dash is zeroing. Light out please when you go to bed. Good night Jeff…..Our gang isn’t quite ready for bed, heck we got leftover pizza more ice cream and a little something in a brown bag that came in from town. Tall boy up Team. An image appears at the door…Shit…’Just checking on things here, don’t forget the lights. You got an early morning you know” That Jeff is quick. He meanders over to see what’s ‘around’ the table. I have my maps spread out talking with Bones looking over options for a slack pack IF my foot continues like it is. We have 3 big days ahead of us and to get one as a slack to Rutland might be a dream. Jeff tells me of a trail angle down that way so I have that in the bank. Thank you Jeff we got it. Early day tomorrow, yes. We got the lights, turning them off, yes, good night.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503510,"Come On Big Dawg. Waking up to the smell of coffee and a hot breakfast was mighty fine. TJ had prepped last night by loading the maker and whipping up pancake batter. The girls up early for first shuttle have made biscuits. Boulder Dash has volunteered to help TJ with the pancakes and are flipping them when I come downstairs to make scrambled eggs. We gonna eat good!The kitchen is a buzz when Jeff comes over from his quarters. I think he was surprised to see us all up and at'em. Let's weigh the packs. Flow and BB first. Not bad for big packs 25 to 28lbs. Shake down time Bones! She has yet to show what's in that REI pack. Dash said last night it was all they could do to fasten it up after food resupply. Pulling out the medical kit I can see she is a Doctor for sure having prepared for any and all emergencies. Send it all home girl. You only need what can fit in the palm of your hand. Oh and that pretty girl stuff, it can go it. Digging deep she pulls out a utility tool that should be on the hip of a construction worker. Put it in the ship home box. 'What about my this?"" She says with a sheepish grin. Our eyes pop wide and we all bust out laughing...A TAZER! Holy shit. Yes throw that in the box. Her pack now down a good five pounds she is under the 30 mark. TJ and Anna in good shape under 28, Jim the lights at 22 and me at 22.15. Again I say I love my new pack and tent. Dash doesn't weigh in. He knows he is at 30 and says he can't seem to get any lighter. Grab that gear and we do shake down on you too we joke.Jeff having delivered the girls to the trail is ready for us now. So long Boulder Dash. Good luck on the rest of you journey. Thanks Jeff for a wonderful stay and accommodations. Dropped back at VT 11/30 we have a climb to Bromley Mtn our highest peak of the day. Anna has taped up my foot for added support. It is quite sore and touchy. I will take sweeper position and be some slow. Summer sunshine with a touch of cool mountain air. Loving this. A good foot path switchbacks up Bromley for 3 miles and then opens up to a field summit. Nice. White and yellow flowers rest amongst the grasses swaying with the breeze. A steep last ascent to the crest and all of the world opens up. THIS is what I imagined Vermont to be. Vast 180 degree views over ridge after ridge with several sky slopes. Bromley has its own sky lift too which looks like the starship enterprise. Hey the girls are here too, we have caught them. Photo op. Shay has been here too. He slept in the hut at the top. Remember we met him our first night at Beaded woods. I hate to leave such a beautiful place but we must move on.Down off Bromley was some wet over the rock steps and roots but very manageable. I take my time and soon catch up with my group at Mad Tom Notch Road. Come On Big Dawg they cheer. Limping in its medication time and a little snack. Five miles in we'll regroup at Peru shelter and wait on the girls too. Probably our last time to see them as we hike on and they are stopping there for the night. Good trail still yet with some overlooks, Styles Peak and Peru Peak. Keeping in ear shot of conversation up front I keep plugging along. I can catch them on the ups but down really bits the foot. I was really ready for a rest at Peru Shelter. Think Jim and TJ were too. I hit the tent pad to stretch out on. I could take a nap TJ says having come 10 miles today. I do like having double digits done by lunch. Before long the girls come in along with Genius and Brother Louie. I know for sure we'll not see these guys again. They will be way ahead now that we are stopped. I get a departing photo. Flow and BB will carry on thru the Whites and report back to me on their hut reservations and such. Hate to miss hiking with these ladies, they do it up right. From here I walked the remaining day by myself catching a glimpse of the gang now and again with curves of the trail and one last open climb to Baker Peak. Jeff told us about this. Rock scramble, open slabs of rock for several hundred feet. Fantastic views back over my shoulder. I have to stop and take pics. More encouragement from above...come on big dawg I hear from Anna. Glad this isn't wet or would be quite treacherous. With only 3 miles to go and all down hill I say see ya at the shelter guys. Big dawg is gonna limp this one in. More meds and a snack. Glad the trail was easy from here. Slopped and almost flat near the bottom. With this home like section I couldn't have a bad day. Foot hurting or not. God has given me so much and helped me along, I have asked.   I know his presence is here too..just look around. Big Branch roars below. I am close. Here are the tent spots south of the suspension bridge. Those soaking pools should be seen soon. Tents along the waters way. The trail take a sharp left turn when I cross the bridge. I now hear Jim and then TJ. They are doing some more Bro Country talk. Hope they sing tonight. I could go for some music. Big Dawg made it to Big Branch. The shelter wasn't much but it was home for the night. Supposed to rain again too. This Party of 5 will make the best of it. Fire is started right away while I head for the water to soak my foot. Temps not such that a dip was warranted but a freshen up is nice. Gathered around the fire we start supper and discuss the idea of slacking the last day. We can call out from the next road hopefully and line Things up for ride tomorrow afternoon into Rutland a day early. Nothing left to do now but toast to it! And toast again. Come on now Jim and I ain't carrying this another step.","Manchester Center - Green Mtn House

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503630,"This Is Vacation. Relief came over me when we all agreed last night that a call for pickup was ok. Big rain, big miles, sore foot, a tooth ache, what other excuses can I think of.   Oh and we are on vacation right? Let's make it fun. With no cell service here we hope the next road in a mile or so will provide. 2 locals came in last night and tented by the shelter with us. He had hiked the Long Trail and gave us details on it and our upcoming section today. Map shows pretty forgiving and he confirms with just a few noted climbs. Says cell service should be good at this upcoming road so we are stoked. Bones is woozy this morning from a doctors induced overdose. I joke here but her tooth ache has become quite painful. It started yesterday and increased to the point she felt necessary to medicate last night. Then this morning was worse and she took something to get her on down the trail. Well it got her down alright, down right sick. We felt for her trying to hike and feeling so bad but she pushed thru. At the road our phone break out. Bones calling for her insurance cards and to make arrangements to see a dentist when we reach Rutland this eve. I contact Jeff at Green Mtn House to get is trail angels number. We are set. Tom, 'plans too much' will pick us up at a road just shy of our scheduled nights stay of Clarendon Shelter, VT 103. Perfect, a 15.8 mile day. I will discuss with him on our ride to town what's best to get in our 'missed miles' and potential shuttle back tomorrow. We hope to meet him about 5:30pmKiddos lead the way, Jim runs sweeper keeping the sick and sore in between. His good conversation makes for a good time passer when you don't hike so well. Rain trickles down the trail and on us as we literally are walking up a creek called Little Black Branch. Since I know we have a passage out from this rainforest later I really don't care now how wet me feet get and start just wading thru it all. Today is the first day of summer and what better way to celebrate than a hikers tradition, hike naked. Don't worry mom, once again I did NOT show my ass. Butt and I say butt another saw fit to let it all hang out. SOBO comes front and center on one our our climbs. Face to face with nature I am, he smiles and says have a good hike, giving us a moon disappearing down the trail. You never know what the trail will bring.7 miles in the trail takes a change on the approach to White Rocks. Spruce trees engulf us and the smell of Christmas fills the air. Open ground areas of just pine needles and rocks, tall black bark trees with no foliage. Where are these white rocks? Finally the carins appear. Dozens and dozens of rock structures stacked by others showing off their artistic talents. We make our own contribution and head for the upcoming shelter for lunch. With us being rained on again off again we look forward to eating under roof. Luckily on the walk off White Rocks the sun popped out a bit to help dry us off. Green wall shelter was a tad more off the trail than I'd liked but we needed to set down, eat, medicate and then make our push for Tom.Shortly after lunch I take a tumble, face plant when my feet fly right out from under me. Mud and Martha don't mix. Poor Anna is closest to me trying to assist. Slipping digging for a foot hold to get this big dawg back up she does her best. Thanks to a close by branch I get a wash off by the crew. All hands on deck please.One last obstacle between us and him, Bear Mountain. There's like 3 of these in the last couple states we've hiked and none have been easy so don't expect this one to be. Suns out guns out baby. TJ lead us up this mutha. Switchbacks are a wonderful thing. This steep incline would be even more of a beast without them. Tiny pants is showing us what he's made of now. True grit not stopping or lessening his pace. Over half way Anna drops to the rear to catch her wind. I keep looking at the Osprey. Jim and Bones just behind me, TJ goes out of sight. Where's the top? I shout out. Nothing. Damn did he walk straight into the the heavens? Finally the trail hits peak and skirts the edges leaving us with no lookout. So disappointing. I huff and huff with disgust after all the effort. Oh well at least that is behind us.Having just 4 miles to pickup I feel we are home free. All down hill too. I drop to the rear and lessen my stride. More home like hiking and yes we have dried out. Rain jackets off enjoying the last part of our hike.But then, darkness, no no, no more rain. This time with thunder. A front has moved directly above. Rumbles from the heavens. I pray to you Lord have mercy on us. The kids are really scootin now, running for the road a good 2 miles away. In between I don't dare loose sight of them. Bones has stopped to put on her rain jacket and Jim to adjust his pack. Then it happens, monsoon time. Trail is a full on river. Water rolls over my shoe tops. I find myself in a slight run myself with little regard to safety. Foot what foot I don't even feel it. Glancing over my shoulder I don't see the others and barely have a bead on my kids. Gotta go, don't stop. Reaching a slight clearing it's an overlook, the rain dissipates. A chair sets inviting. TJ settles in taking in the view over the Rutland Airport. Waves of white clouds roll over the valley as the calm after the storm rolls in. Dripping wet we arrive at our road, Tom we are here 5:30 as promised. He instructs us to hang a left and walk down the The Whistle stop for food and ice cream. And he will pick us up there. Damn the bad luck, closed on Mondays. Oh well we shall use the caboose to hide behind and change to dry clothes for the ride to town. I call the Yellow Deli Hostel and get the ok to come in a night early. I knew it would be ok as when I contacted them month ago I got, ""it's cool man, you come on in, we make room, no reservation needed"".Tom got us to town and gave us all the details for using the bus service to get back to the trail tomorrow. Loves his 'job' providing for hikers and didn't want payment but we didn't let that go. We might need ya again so please accept. The Yellow Deli is Mello Yellow. Aish and his commune own and run the deli, an outfitter store and the hostel upstairs. All work for stay or donation, we did a little of both. Girls and guys bunk room. Ox and Library are here too. Time for a burger, wings and things. Vacation, Who's with me?","Big Branch Shelter
","VT 103, Rutland Yellow Deli","Jun 21, Sun",15.80
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503812,"The Wheels on the Bus go Round and Round. And so does Martha with a map. I looked over it very carefully. Asked for bus drivers approval. Sorta got Jim's ok. Where the heck are we on this route 4? We made the right choice to come on into town yesterday. We are dried out, clean and slack packing today's scheduled 17 miles. Not getting our cheeseburger last night make us only that more hungry for one tonight upon return. Yea the Hoppin Moose was closed dang it so no cool local tap room hang at and eat. So we settled for wings and things at another and then ate dinner with Little Harry's. Shoot we may end up there again too.Our host Aish had us a hot breakfast this morning of scrambled eggs and rice with homemade breads, fruit and diced tomatoes with onions. Their piped gypsy music soothed us as we visited at the round table. He gave me details on using the bus services And is walking distance from the deli. Perfect we can pay $3 to ride each way. Bones will not be joining us today, that tooth. She has made an appointment with town dentist and hopefully finds some relief. So we head for the bus stop. See ya for supper.The Red Dot pulls in, that's our line. Asking the lady when we board if this does stop at Sherburne Pass she confirms. We are set. Still looking over my map on the ride up toward Killington I wanna make sure she and I are on the same page so at her next stop I go up front to chat one last time. 'Can you drop us right here?' I point to THE spot. Sure can that's up next. All the while 3 other hikers have just loaded and they too confirm we can get to the trail from here. So it has to right, right?Attack on Killington, here we come. We step off the bus, the hikers point us down by an outfitter store and into a disc golf course. 'You'll see the signs for the AT, trust us! Oh and we do. I still don't feel right, map shows the trail goes right across the road, RT 4, where are the blazes? Walking down the golf course we do see little white signs with AT on them, still no blazes. Wandering around on the course following what seems like a trail we finally see an official ATC sign, Maine this way, Georgia that way. Well at least we know we are hiking south. And yes south is the travel plan today. Passing a pond we then come to a side road. Hummmm this ain't supposed to be here. Jim is good with direction and says am I crazy? Why do I feel like we are hiking north. Map time. I point to where I think we are, this is rd 100. We are almost 5miles north of where we should have been dropped. Shit. I just turned our somewhat easy day to a 22 miler. Our heads drop. Jim wheels out front wanting to get this march started. We are all pondering the math here and potential arrival time to finish. Deduction, ain't no way we can make that 6:15 bus ride back from where we left off yesterday. Shit it's gonna take us a couple hours just to get back to our original starting point to make the assault on Killington. Chatting over options, disgust and some laughs we take our medicine and knock out the next mile. All up by the way. I have dropped back, mad and lethargic. Trail is soup again, my legs are jelly, oh and did I say I was mad? Yes at myself for putting us in this predicament. Kiddos are running up this damn hill hoping to regain time. Jim too. I ain't running, not today. Hell this is supposed to be vacation, fun. I ain't having no fun. Almost to the top. Come on Big Dawg. They do love me. Shit that was hard. Jim stands sweating with his bandana tied in bro country fashion around his head. Didn't think this section would be this hard he says. Walking off the other side we knock around the idea of shortening our trip. Hey we will be right back to good ol' RT 4 in 30 minutes. I don't mind spending my last day with a cold one in hand watching the World Cup. I have the number to Tom handy he is just a phone call away. A sigh of relief comes over the gang. Never thought I'd hear Martha say that, Jim says. But glad she did said Anna. Hurry lets get to that road before she changes her mind.Trucks and cars rush by. Trying to call out to Tom my team finds it funny to get the truckers to sound off their horns. Nice thanks I can't hear a thing. Laughing and joking we must hurry across the road so we can flag the bus down. Tom says it will be by in the next 5 minutes. What luck.Fancy meeting you again I say stepping into the bus. Yep same bus driver from this morning, 11am now. We tell her of our demise and begin planning our next moves in town. Quick shower, food, and friends. Cheers with a Long Trail. Cheeseburger in hand. Now this is vacation.P.S. Bones tooth was ok. No root canal needed just a little irritated. Ox came in to the deli too. He joined us and Bones for a celebratory dinner together back at Little Harry's. Hate to say goodbye but we send our good wishes with our north bound hikers. We didn't make that attack on Killington but don't you worry we shall pick that up on the next trip back. P.S.S. We have determined we had rather hike for 13 hours than ride a train for 13. My feet don't swell as bad and the scenery is so much better. Don't worry Amtrak you'll still have us aboard for at least another or till the tracks run out to Maine.","Some where on Rt 4 -near outfitters

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515840,"So have you ever heard of this challenge? Hiking from Harpers Ferry VA to the Mason Dixon Line. Sounds easy enough but all in one day! That’s 42.8 miles in 24 hours. Many a hiker have gotten up in the wee AM hours to finish in the late night exhausted yet determined to walk an entire state of the AT in one day. Seasoned you’d have to be to do so. Ask one of our own who tried this feat only just last year. I’m sure Slim Jim will be back to make this a reality. On the flip side we’re rollin easy like Sunday morning baby just set back and enjoy the ride on the L-Train. Saturday: What’s a trip to Harper’s Ferry without visiting the ATC headquarters? I have to get my fix, smell the hiker funk when you walk in the door from pack stains on the wood floor, friendly smiles of workers and those like me looking to check-in. A few SOBOs around too. We strolled down town soaking up the morning sun and historical past. John Brown and his raiders, the confluence of the great rivers, and the Appalachian Trail. I could only entice Larry with so much ice cream to stay and walk around a little more before the trumpets of Charles Town races called him. Horses to Post and we’re off! Run baby run mama needs a new pair of hiking shoes. The Breeders Cup pre-races were many and then finally the big purse. “Put it all on Red Hot Diva”. Go Go Go..I didn’t win or lose it all. As they say I finished about even, right Larry?Sunday: Let’s get our hike on. We met our shuttle man, Dennis, at Pen-Mar Park. Leaving our car here he will take us south to Wolfsville Road and we’ll hike back north to it. Entertaining us on the drive over we heard all about how he came to be a trail angle. Not knowing the first thing about the AT he did however know hikers were getting shafted with high taxi rates from Hagerstown Md. So he put his name out for shuttle service landing him in AWOLs guide. “Man he’d say, you hikers are craaaazy hiking all those miles but heeeey if you need a ride I’ll get you they-aa.” I told him if he didn’t hear back from me we’d need his services again in the morning for the next section. Larry assured him that probably wouldn’t be as Dennis drove off and left Larry with me. You’re stuck now baby 10 miles back to the car and Rocky’s Pizzeria. The little parking spot was packed and I could already hear folks talking from up the way at the shelter not far from the road. Wonder if the trail will be full? New blazes and new miles under foot. I am happy to be back. We have a rolling first couple of miles with some ups and downs that will test our legs. Larry is already asking to look at the map after the first two ups. Where’s that down I saw he says? When’s lunch? I gotta be off the trail for that 3:30 football game.Having hikers passing every so often gave him someone to check in with on what was up ahead. Flat trail? Water? Next hill? Food? Beer? Anything to talk about he did. Finally at Warner Gap some 3 miles in we ran into a group of older ladies with big packs coming down what we must go up. 2 more miles till lunch big guy, don’t let these old folks show you up. They chuckled under their breath as Larry perked up and asked if they knew where he could find a good woman to take care of him. Pushing up our hardest climb of the day I run into a local who assures us this IS the hardest we’ll see and the trail flattens out shortly after 500 feet elevation. Trust me there is nothing up here we haven’t seen in VA and then some. Very forgiving with summits seen from the bottom of the climb. Glad to have this fellow’s assurances Larry moved on a little faster to reach the shelter and lunch.Raven Rock shelter was nice as all the MD/PA shelters seen so far. Clean as a pin, picnic tables and plenty of setting benches. Plenty of camping spots too. Enjoying lunch leaves fell from the trees with a slight breeze. Beautiful fall. Tapping his phone I know that’s the signal that the train is leaving this station and ready to roll on to the next stop. 5 miles to go and this train must station at 3:30 I’m told. Flat flat good trail. Let’s hope my man’s legs hold up. A sign comes up side trail High Rocks Trail .2. Larry is out,telling me to go right on and see it. I’ll catch back up. He’ll head on and tackle the rock scramble we’ve been told about up ahead. Walking out to the overlook I hear a passle of voices, motorcycles you name it. It was like Bear Mtn NY but not as big. People everywhere since you can drive right to this point. Graffiti, Graffiti Graffiti. Terrible. Kids have painted every spot on the rock area. I wasted my time I thought but hey I can at least say I was here. Humm should I write my name too to prove it?Back at the AT I hurry along to catch the train. He’s moved on pretty good as it took me awhile to finally see his red hat down below. Rocks Rocks, hate rock scrambles. Almost better without sticks in hand but I continue on. About a mile of rocks was enough for us. By far the hardest of the day.We start meeting more folks and know we are closing in on Pen-Mar. Get me out of here Larry says, where’s the car? Oh it can’t be as bad a bee sting or could it? I step on a soft part of ground between some rocks and bam BUZZZZ. Yellow Jacket jumps down in my shoe and goes to town on the inside of my ankle. Well every cuss word flies from my mouth as fast as Mr. Sting landed. Dancing around on one foot I pull off my shoe before he dives in for another bite. Bastard! Oh it stings; I dig for medication, anything to cut the hurt. Larry is in a fright turning to laughter. That was some fit you put on wish I had that on tape. Pulling into Pen-Mar was great and uncomfortable all at the same time. My foot starting to swell a bit and burning like crazy but ol Larry did great, we did great. Hey pretty good covering 10 miles in a 5 hours and 30 minutes. It ain’t no marathon pace. It’s easy like Sunday evening L-Train Style. Dennis did come back to check on us. Very Cool. Ya’ll did make it, good good. Need me tomorrow? He asked. Larry spoke up quickly to decline. Saying his rate would by higher than Dennis’s only if he was made to walk again.","Wolfsville Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515854,"10-12-15 Wolfsville Road to Washington Monument State ParkYes we are back right where we started yesterday. Hiking south this time getting the last 12 miles I have left in Maryland. I hear it is easier this direction but not such to entice the L-train to run today. He is my full time shuttle man now planning to relax during my hiking time and review his civil war history. Not a car in the parking spot now. Just me and the trail. Wonder if I will even see a sole. It's Monday but still a holiday so who knows. I tip my shuttle with a hug and kiss and cut into the woods.Climbing up the only real elevation of the day I can feel my legs trying to warm up. Not feeling too out of shape I push myself a little to see if that 'hiker' pace I once had in June can come on back. Trust me that's gonna take a lot more than this but it is a good start. Cresting the hill a short rock section and its back on the boulevard. Nice wide forest road type trail. Hiking along by myself I hear all sounds. Twigs snap under foot, a branch creaks in the slight wind, a rustle in the leaves. I can't help but be extra aware. I don't know these parts and they don't know me. Needing to shake the dew off my lily I figure this little bit of rock cover and brush will do. Good thing I was quick about. Just as I stepped back in stride a hiker approaches. Howdy and good morning. Wonderful day for a hike we both acknowledge. His partners follows just behind. Not long a few more come along. All in overnight packs probably been out over the long weekend.    Making great time I have reached my 5 mile mark in less than 2 hours, nice! Pogo campsite. Destination for lunch will be Annapolis Rocks, 7 miles in. I do hope it is accessible. News reports last night said a person fell to his death from there. Carelessly jumping between rocks taking pictures. Since I have no idea if the trail runs across this overlook or is a side trail I just keep on trucking. Hearing kids I must be close to the next overlook, Black Rock Cliffs. It's a stones throw off the AT so why not investigate. It's a group of 15, girls in dresses and little white bonnets, boys in plaid shirts and dress pants. Asking an adult who goes here? I find out they are a Mennonite school field trip. Perfect day for it folks. Say can I get a photo taken? A young lad jumps to the job and clears his friends for me to center up. Snap and there ya go. Nice meeting everyone gotta roll I have a shuttle to catch.One mile lies between here and lunch. Flat flat. I ask another approaching hiker, many passed now, what the situation is a Annapolis, can I pass? Oh yes and you have timed it right a big group will be leaving just about the time you arrive. Whoop whoop. This will be group number 3 for the whole trip. I forgot to tell you about the biggest pack of people I have ever seen yesterday. Larry and I had just left Ravens rock shelter and a train of close to 100 comes up. It looked like the Mexican boarder just opened up. Kids and a few adults bright eyed and loaded down step to the side for us to pass. ""Are we having fun I say?"" Se Se ""Thanks for the audience I feel like the President."" We are in a parade. Happy hiking my friends.Needless to say I am now hoping that big of a pack isn't still on Annapolis. Reaching the trail junction it is marked .25 just like the hiker told me. And here they come 30-40 heading back up to the AT. Not just a side trail to a rock overlook but this area is set up for designated camp sites with a caretaker area. Betting he is here thru the summer. Closing in more voices and the woods open to wide,rock ledges similar to our Tinker Cliffs. Searching for a place to light I find a spot comfortably from the edge but with no people obstruction. There are plenty here, high schoolers, moms with kids and a few rock climbers. A very popular place. The place to be on Columbus Day. Middleton and Greenbrier park below. We are above tree tops with little room for error if scampering around. I think of the fallen hiker and wonder his location of the fall. Enjoying my lunch and view I make small talk with others. A couple of fellers were quite inquisitive about my packs patches and the AT. So why not give a class myself. And before I know it a small group has listened in and I am the focal point and forest ranger leading class about this 2180 mile path from GA-ME. Class adjourned gotta a shuttle to catch. Larry has my eta and location so I know he isn't gonna forget me right? Surely a table of cards, a winning hand wouldn't keep him from his wife? Hope them horses aren't running today. Shit I better contact him or my mind will run crazy wondering.With lots of down ahead I am coasting into the highway I-70 footbridge. Passing Pine Knob Shelter I hear the traffic noise. White blazes are few along here so I am careful not to miss a turn along these several side paths. Stepping on the footbridge-wired covering over head-felt weird walking right over speeding cars. 3 miles to Washington Monument State Park. Walking right between neighbors yards also felt strange. This does happen every now and again but mostly avoids. I scan for water spigots or options for trail magic. Not that I need but wonder if available during thru hiker season. Soon out of the 'town feel' I'm back 'in the woods'. Beginning that last climb to the park. You have one hell of a climb a young lad tells me. Random loaded pack on him and a big log for a hiking stick he addresses me as ma'am. Do you know how far the shelter is? Park ranger said a few miles. You got several miles my friend. Neither was news he wanted to hear. This hell of a climb wasn't that much especially once I saw Larry hiking down to me. I know that finish line ain't far now. This shuttle man isn't wandering too far from his ride. Come on old women let this L-train take you home.Well Larry didn't clip off all those MD miles to say he walked all of the AT in one state but all isn't lost that it still can't happen one day. Who knows maybe I will come back and try that MD challenge but for now it was most satisfying completing it in L-train style.","Wolfsville Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516824,"No goblins or witches on this mountain just us hikers looking for a treat. And what treats there were to find. A nip in the air, frost under foot, fallen leaves…like all of them. Oh and the sweet smoky smell of fires warming the lodge.The L-train once again has picked our destination hoping to see the last of fall from 4000 feet. We arrived on the mountain just before 10:00am and glad for the delay since the heavy frost was just finishing melt off from a crisp 30 degree morning. The lake itself is still trying to return and has made some improvement on water level but far shy of its once full pond. Having hiked around it many times Larry chooses the golf course route for us. Imagine that. No clubs or golf cart needed for this hike just your imagination of where the greens used to be on this once played 9 hole course. Work has been done on the grounds approaching with our guess of maybe some future activities for the old course other than just disc golf. Marvelous views from up here. Wide open fields lay over with the winds. I hurry to the old clubhouse ruins for protection and take in the view over Pembroke. Larry chats with two other hikers who have come up the exercise their dogs. Looking at the map we decide to skirt the top of the mountain ending back up at the lodge hiking about 4 miles. Now you know I ain't ending a trip with this puny number. Come on L-train pick another trail! Dropping our sticks at the car we settle on an out and back to the stables adding about 2 more miles for the day. I've been wanting to see their treetop adventure course and if anything else is new at the barn. This path gave some more views of the lake and a gradual grade for a little extra treat.      Two groups were at the barn one finishing up and another getting instruction on how to use harnesses for safety. I just wonder how many kids sneak up here and just scamper around on the platforms and ropes when no one is looking.Returning back to the lodge Larry's trail time is at about its max. Me, well I got just enough to suit my fancy so we wrapped up our Halloween Hike. M&M anyone? Trick or Treat.","Mountain Lake

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517109,"A day of Remembrance. Shouldn’t that kind of be every day and not just a date on the calendar? Bonnie and I decided we’d honor all on this glorious fall day and hike to visit an old vet who lays to rest on top of Brushy Mountain. Parking at the foot of Brushy along Craig’s Creek road a few cars were already in the lot. Making sure we have some orange showing so not to be fair game during the beginning of our hunting season we set off across the road. My hands are a bit cold from the dampness left over from a cold overnight rain. Partly cloudy skies have us in an extra layer till we warm up. Still shorts on me trying to hang on to the thoughts of warm weather. Leaves cover the trail and make for a noisy walk and loud conversation so we can hear one another. But once back into the holler after crossings of the numerous footbridges we hit the climbing section I call it. We get quite along with the rest of the woods. Piney woods with the trail switch backing almost to the top. Warm up time!Bon Bon is right on my heels like old times. All we need now is Noni and Sandra to round out the little harem. Say anyone seen the Captain? You guys are missing out is all I got to say.Working our way up the mountain we run into a couple and their three dogs. 2 of the pups look like twins and all have their own packs. NICE. Before long we are at the crest and the wooden park bench. A perfect place for a rest and photo op. Glad someone has marked AT N, AT S since the white blazes are far spaced thru here and quite faded. Not that we don’t know the way but a thru hike may not since the trail is now a wide forest road. Our shoes disappear underneath the downed leaves and thick field like grass. A good ½ mile walk and the side path to the site we reach. An American flag hangs tall above the granite monument with many deposits of dedication to this fallen soldier here and others around. Dog tags, engraved metal plates and other relics left behind from visitors have increased along with a growing rock cairn. I see my little flag left in salute to Operation Enduring Freedom is here too.We step back to take it all in as the sound of a plane flies over…Harry is that you? The ghost of Audie? It seems to happen every time I’ve been here…..Lunch was good and filling. Didn’t take too long to feel the nip in the air and decide to make for our return walk off the mountain. Back at the bench a small group has gathered. 2 ladies from northern VA are sectioning from Damascus north a ways. Boy did one look like Shortcut’s twin, even sported an orange hat similar to Jim’s Baum Proof Gear prototype. They are slacking today since coming off a rainy yesterday. Spry gals they are and congratulatory of my miles already hiked along the AT. The others are out just going to the monument. Then one other lady hiker comes up the trail heading for Catawba and supplies. Was that Bruce Jenner? You’d have to see it to believe it. Well ladies it’s time for us two to make tracks off this mountain, good luck and good hiking. Blazing the trail down went by pretty fast. Good company makes the time fly. No hunters seen today just a few fire arms heard in the distance. Maybe they are presenting arms for a salute. As for us we give thanks to our vets that we can enjoy such freedoms of a pleasant walk in the woods.","Rt. 621

Shortcut will arrive in the morning and Mama Goose will see us at our starting point, Max Patch.

The weather looks great with the high winds lying and sunny skies coming on.If you have never been to Standing Bear you need to schedule it. A farm turned hiker heaven. The bunkhouse and wood stove called us in. Drum barrels made for an awesome stove with the heat hitting us in the face with we arrived.

Not ready to step outside and visit the privy just yet. Jim has stoked the fire to keep us warm right up till time to rise. Jack thought it too hot so he has slept on the back porch. After a few more winks I give my own wake-up call to rustle up the resters.The best part of waking up is some TJ’s coffee in your cup. I’m no coffee coinsurer, heck I don’t even like the stuff but the aroma did taste good. Red Rooster’s finest brewed to perfection by our own barista. Gotta have a muffin with coffee right? Well ol Slim Jim’s got that covered. Strawberry Rhubarb or Blueberry Chocolate Chip? Uh both please. Grapes to round off a well balance meal. Shortcut arrives just in time to get her fill too.Maria has the van ready for transport. Jack has given us all our trail advice making sure we ‘section hikers’ have what we need for the day. Water, sandwich, map. He’ll have the house warm upon our return.Turning up the dust on the back roads Maria delivers us the parking lot of Max Patch. Mama Goose drives in. She was going to spend the night on the top after hiking from Hot Springs but high winds of the previous days blew her into a friend’s cabin instead. Good choice. Shortcut leads the way to the top. This is her stomping ground so to speak having come her many times. This side path connects to the AT and Jim can walk his final stretch of miles in TN and check this state off as complete. Mama Goose tells us her story. She is an air force veteran and hiked the AT in 2013 with the Warrior Hike campaign and the PCT in 2015. She was a combat medic flying evacuation on a C-130’s during Desert Storm, currently a physical therapist married to the mountains. Wow some gal. So glad she has fallen into our pack today. Oh and let’s not forget her walking companions, Addi and Ruby. The puppy dogs are as excited to see this mountain as us. Crisp morning air blows as we crest the ridge. Wide open 180 degree views. Mountain ranges surround us. What a treat first thing on this blue bird day. A large tent is set up. Hopefully from just this morning or they’d had a very cold night. Blazed fence posts guide the way across this grassy patch soon off the ridge into the woods and the warmth. Most of the leaves are all down now for us to trudge thru. Glad we are going down for the time being makes for a very quick 6 miles. All our conversation has the time flying by as well. Not to mention our chats with other hikers out along this way. Some day trippers and some overnight adventurers. Mama Goose even knew one gal in a group that was out. Reaching our lunch stop at Groundhog Creek Shelter we gather around the picnic table. Jim’s one pet peeve along the trail…you better have a proper table for cooking and eating. Deep Gap delivered for him. We have the place to ourselves. Addi and Ruby rustle in the leaves doing what dogs do best. 7.6 miles left on the day with one big ol climb up Snowbird Mountain. Shortcut gets a head start and leads the way. Setting a good steady pace we all follow in behind her. Yes we are being led by a 71 year old little power packed woman. Short in stature but strong on hiking strength. Steeper the trail turns she steps aside for another to take over. Mama Goose and I come on along for our turn at it. I hear Jimmy rooting himself on, come on Jimmy, come on. Kiddos chatter comes to a halt with breathing taking over as top priority. Feeling pretty good myself I can tell my gym time is paying off. Soon the woods part and another open ridge top comes to us. Snowbird.Pulling over to a camp spot for a rest we drop the packs and enjoy this great view too. Not there 10 minutes and Shortcut comes popping up into sight. She is tough as nails. We lay out in the grass like old huntin dogs that’s been running all night. We can rest with the best of ‘em. Ruby has become a new friend to Anna and TJ loving on them and panting for attention. Gather around troops let me get this on film. Rested and ready we have 4 more miles let’s get to it so we can have that hot shower, cold brew and sketti! Down Down here we go. I feel my knees talking. Leaves deep and footing sketchy. Quick steps work better for me than long strides. Rocks hide underneath and kicking them first is better than stepping on them and sliding. Shortcut slows her pace to match the terrain with better footing. TJ keeps a close eye out to not lose track of her. Once miss step and you’d slide to the bottom. Trail turns wider and wider until on a fire road. Not long now folks and we’ll be back at the dirt road for Standing Bear. Evening sun greets us rounding the mountains edges. 4:00 and all’s well we crow. The dirt road the dirt road. Hip Hip Hurray! Slim Jim has completed TennessAA. Jack greets us back at the bunkhouse and is anxious to hear of our day. We invite him for sketti and celebration in the kitchen once we clean up. The hottest shower on the trail awaits me. I turn on the knob, cold, WHAT? Burner is out. Handy Man!!! Morgan gets things right while I have a ‘rootbeer’ and gather my supplies for fixing dinner. Oh and a feast we had. Garlic bread, sketti, vino and other spirits passed around the table. We feed 3 SOBOS with our left overs while they awaited a ride to town for all you can eat Chinese buffet. First dinner on us fellas. Want a Gatorade too? See the cooler out front. Smiles creeped from under their beards and filled us with thanks.

Giles County more so than most. 20 some degrees and clear skies made for a winter like hike. While waiting on a hiking partner I run over my inventory to be prepared…Gloves-check, wool hat-check (thank’s again Jim for my new BaumProofGear ladies leopard print version) fleece jacket-check, Nancy-check. Nancy who you say? She blew in from the windy city and is looking for a trail fix before having to leave back home for Chicago. I was hoping to get her another weekend to share McAfee Knob but today Angels Rest will have to do. She hiked with us last winter to the Cascades and did great in the snow and ice. Duh Chi-CAAHgo…Today’s climb will be a challenge but I know she’s up for it. We have the parking spot to our own, sorta expected that this early on a Saturday. Cutting up into the woods we go. Rain water has frozen under the ground and crunches with every foot step. My sticks can’t even puncture the service. Chatty Cathies we are. Not getting to really visit with each other much except for a Hokie football game here and there and a hike now and again we burn up the woods with conversation. I can talk some trail and lay it on thick. Now I can’t talk as fast as those northerners but I can sure try and listen as fast. Looking over my shoulder I do try to make sure and not hit the mountain too fast and blow out my hiking friend. Red faced and bright eyed she is primed for water break. I gotta come out of these gloves, hat and fleece. Being the first real shot of cold weather it time to adjust… uphill means NO winter clothes needed. Shoot Nancy is used to blizzard like weather and is dropping the few layers she has on too. This little over a mile and a half of up is switch backed nicely to alleviate the pull on the legs and lungs. But as we all know the trail can’t forgive all the time. Once that path gets narrow and closes in let the real fun begin. You ready Nancy? The chatter comes to an end and the breathing hard begins. We’re almost there girl. Keep diggin. One more rock step area and the trail sign will tell us we are there. Angels Rest – a blue blazed path runs thru tightly hung rhododendrons, shaded on the north side of this mountain but opens up to all of Pearisburg below. WOW now that’s something. Fog still settles over the winding river below. Red roofs dot the little burg. There’s where we drove into and walked up from. Reckon they even know we’re up here?We scamper around on the big rock to get a better view and photo op. Dark and shaded hard to do so with any proficiency. Captain we need you! Cooling off our sweat is making us cold so let’s get to moving onto the next view, Wilburn Valley Overlook.Shady side turns full on sunny side. The half mile jaunt to the overlook makes it all worth the while. This is what hiking is all about, sharing the trail with friends. Setting on the rock ledge we take in yet another valley view and say our thanks for being here. Ah man does this make me feel good. I wish we could walk all day but we have things to do and places to be. Let the Christmas season begin and this here is the perfect way to kick it all off.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518375,"I will use a quote for the weekend from a friend of mine. “We’ve been given a gift, get out and enjoy it!!!” And that is exactly what we did. Bonnie and I got up a little extra early to fit in a good 7 mile hike and have the rest of our day for Christmas preparation and parties. We met at the little Newport Stop and Go to car pool. I suspected with a 70 degree day in the forecast that would call out all hikers to the trail. We got a prime parking spot just outside of the Nascar’s ladies boundaries and set off on our hike.Surprised at the new trail work in the bottom lands we were mighty glad to have it. Not only had the foot bridge been “tightened up” a better blank system have been lane in place to keep our feet dry. Those beavers have really made themselves a new home and a once small stream has turned this entire field into a marshy bog. One miss step from the boardwalk might land you in the muck coming up without a shoe!Speaking of shoes this hiker will be out of her hiking shoes after today into a new sort of shoe. An orthopedic boot on the right foot. Remember my little tweak that happened on our long hike in Vermont last summer? Well that never healed up. I finally gave in for a doctor visit this past Friday and have some torn ligaments and bone displacement. Scheduled MRI is for the 28th and back to him to see what’s next. So today is all about soaking up all the sun, fun, friend(s) and white blazes I can. It’s pretty much all uphill from the start till the knob and all down on the return. Just the way I like a 7 mile hike. Just think Bonnie we could about face and do it all over again when we get back and that would be like our normal days coming in New Hampshire. NO thanks she says. I’ll just read about it. Warmed up from the field walk we enter the woods and head for the old Blair witch house. Bonnie was surprised to see it all torn down. Just a pile of rubble now and a small fire ring by the trail left by hiker or hunter. Hearing Laurel Creek our minds race as to what we’ll be crossing. With all the rain the last month this might be up for rock hopping. Slick and mossy, watch your step Bonnie. I think I will cross right here and take it slow. Plenty of rocks to take your pick depending on leg length. Good thing or BonBon would be in a pinch. One crossing down one more to go. Once over it we are at the shelter and decide to keep on trucking. Warm patches of light wind bring us to the real hill of the day, THE KNOB. We both reminisce about the first time hiking here. Janet and Dad were along and we did it in the snow. One step up and two steps back. We thought we’d never get to the top and come to find out we never really did, reach the knob anyways. Worn out and worked up I made an executive decision and claimed the first flat spot and somewhat of a rock overlook as Kelly’s Knob. Come to find out we were just a short distance from the trail sign designating the actual spot.So now going up I know every turn having been here more than a dozen times. Bonnie pretty much does too. Feeling froggy I set into my hiker uphill training mode. Head down and get to the top, No stop. Bonnie disappears but I can still hear her sticks clicking, she’s in her groove too. What a work out. As a thru-hiker call it, this should be named a mountain in the trail book not a knob. So true Ridge Rambler. Seeing the shrubs up ahead I know the top is within steps. I find a log to set on for a waiting rest. Still quiet it is. Just my heart beating. A bird tweet now and again and then the click of Bonnie’s sticks. “Sure glad to see the shrubs”Who would have thought we’d be in spring like weather in December? Look campers. Bet they had a wonderful night up here on the mountain. Good morning we shout closing in on them. A group of college kids taking a break from exams. I’m jealous of your camp spot. How was it last night?   Our first sighting of others but that is soon to change.Having the knob to ourselves for a little while sure was nice. Lunch and leisure. Pick a rock and soak up this day. No need to scamper around for us. Been there done that. We’ll let the schoolers take care of that. Just like hopscotch they hit rock to rock to make their way out to the very edge jumping over the crevasses. The old crooked tree is still here no better place to take a photo I think. So long college friends. Good luck and happy trails.Time to test our downhill fortitude. I step easy to keep the foot as level as I can. HA keep trying with that Lead Dog. That’s why the doctor was called. Bonnie clips along behind chatting away making this trip roll in fast forward. Hikes are really starting to appear now. Groups of 5, 2 here, 4 there. The knob will be a busy place soon enough. Some say they have been here before and some are newbies. You’ll love it I say. You’re almost there and it is well worth it.Down Down we are back to the marsh now our day is coming to an end. Oh I am not ready. Sure you don’t want to turn around Bonnie? NO then we’ll be finishing when these crazy kids will, In The Dark. The parking area is packed. Not an empty place in the little grassy pull off. 3 cars deep in places and more are coming. We don’t stay too long for our post hike activities making room for one more. Which way to the trail they say? Oblivious to which direction for the Keefer Oak vs Kelly’s Knob. I direct them right…Just follow those white blazes girls and enjoy this marvelous gift!","Angels Rest

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519874,"The falls never fails to deliver. Gives ya a short hike when you need a taste of the trail. And boy did I need a taste. It’s been a month since I’ve been out and I miss it so especially this time of year. Having come off the rush of the holiday season it’s always good to slow things back down and step back into the woods.With another rain event just the day before, carrying into this morning by the way, it left the trail wet but not frozen which is unusual in January. Wonder if the ice has begun to build at the main event? Good thing TJ bought that poncho on the way in to keep his new down jacket dry. Leave that thing on man…I wasn’t the only one excited to hike today….Maria is jumping from side to side wagging her puppy dog tail ready to experience a new adventure. This will be her first hike. Anna and TJ just had to get a pup after falling in love with MamaGoose’s two dogs on our overnight to Standing Bear Hostel. It’s good to have a trail dog back with us.Nothing doing but her to lead the way managed by TJ and her leash. Bonnie and Jeff have joined us too. Larry is glad to have some male companionship as the group splits out to the girls and guys with him take the sweeper position. We have the trail to ourselves with just a few cars left in the parking lot. Pretty cold this morning but we are protected from the winds down in this holler. Anna’s trying out her new Salomon boots. A mid high top version of the same shoes I’ve been wearing with a gortex liner. Warm and dry feet she will have and no more turning those ankles.Look out New Hampshire and her rocks.Stepping along gingerly at first I test my foot which has been acting up for some time now. I’ve run the gamut on diagnose from the doctor. X-rays, Mri, pills, stabilizing boot, lastly a cortisone shot, OUCH. She’s still tender and not quite right but it ain’t broke so here I am. I’ll keep on keeping on till it falls off I reckon.Peaceful the waters are this first mile or so up to the falls. Full flowing from all the rain you can tell where downpours caused her to wash out of her banks. Bet there’s a fish or two back under those big rocks. Maria’s tests the water with her nose but not very close, she is still learning and scared of the unknowns. The big boys lag some behind us as the trail turns upward from the lower trail and the stair steps begin. Heart rates go up and breathing intensifies. Yo Larry you coming? Yo Jeff if you’d slow it up you could catch your breath. The L-Train has it all figured out. Slow and steady wins the race. Don’t blow your engine man!Ice begins to show along the way now and that roar starts…the Cascades are close. Water rushes around the large hand placed hopping rocks approaching. The mountain flows freely. The falls mist rushes over us and I grab the rain jacket to keep from getting damp and chilled. An arch of ice has begun to form within the falls. We settle in on the first viewing deck for a quick snack and photo ops. WATCH, LOOK OUT! A block of ice breaks from the next deck area above and drops down just missing us. Bet that won’t happen for long. A nor’easter is coming our way after today and will thicken everything up and put the falls in its deep freeze mode.Returning back by way of the fire road we have an easy walk out. Boys and girls groups back in formation chattering all along the way. The Cascades has filled us with her mystic magic, she’s a classic.","Cascades parking lot

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520154,"Here I am ready to go. Rain or Snow, One inch or twelve, with or without. Lonewolfing. I check with the gas station attendant to make sure it is ok to leave my rig here for several hours. And as another measure of just letting someone else know where I am off to. Larry has gotten my first check in text message. I shall text again at my halfway point, Lindamood School.Crossing Rt. 11 I step from pavement into knee deep snow. My sticks help me judge distance of depth prior to each step down the embankment onto the trail. Birds dart around me as if to say someone has entered their territory or maybe to tell me turn back. Feeling pretty confident I can do this short hike I tell myself that’s why I did my at home out the back door field hiking yesterday. I tested walking in deep snow and seemed to make out ok. So why not take it to the trail….Ahh sweet sunshine. Bluest of blue skies. 16 degrees and warming…I hope. Dressed in my best winter gear I am not remotely cold. Gaters on and yak trax. Now I’m not exactly post holing since this snow is fluffy but still a foot+ of snow is a work out. Sunshine has the snow glistening like diamonds. I don’t think I have ever seen such. It mesmerizes me. My photos don’t come close to capturing either. I did try several times but the sparkling was not transferred. Making up the first crest of the open field I can hear and see the interstate and do ponder the thought of turning around. But hey why would I do that? The big red house and its barn stand alone on the next crest. The trail follows with in eye shot for a good mile. Then I’ll come to the boardwalk and railroad crossing. I’ll make another “turn around evaluation” then. Hell I’ve only be walking for 10 minutes and it feels like 30. Remembering this isn’t a timed event, I have all day, slow and steady wins the race I back off my internal pace as this isn’t remotely transferring to my feet. Step one two three, Step one two three, is the cadence in my head. Now this is more like it. Calm and easy. Well let’s just go with calm. Down to the boardwalk the trail goes. I take my time over this wooden walkway. One slip and I’ll be in the icy swamp below. Water cress glimmers green around the tall strands of dried out cattails. That big red house is so close now seems I could almost touch it. Standing on the railroad tracks I look both ways. “Train Train take me on out of this town” rings in my head. Along with the thoughts, I’m not turning around. Settled into the fact that I only have 2.8 miles to walk one way I certainly could muster up the strength to finish that. My mind wonders to remember how many ups till I reach Lindamood? There’s this one and then the open fields again and then some woods. Well let me tell ya the mind plays tricks. And it forgets! Minutes become an hour and an hour becomes 2.Every turn that I thought this was the turn down to the old school field the trail leads me to another step of deep snow. The northern slopes had drifts up over my knees. Thank goodness there were only 2 major spots of this and only about 5 to 10 steps each. Wow that Hiking Viking guy who’s out there in the real mountains of New Hampshire is making feel quite insignificant. Much respect my hiking friend. Now back to me. Hup 2 3 4. Get up this ridge and push some more. A yodel off in the distance has my ear. I see buildings; could this be the old farm place, the settlers museum area, Lindamood? Can’t be, which comes first? I know the school does and then the yodel sound again. Buddy? Buddy Coonhound is that you? Has Jim come up? That’s it, he felt bad that I was out alone and has come up to meet me for lunch. I’ll catch a ride back with him. The yodel becomes more sharpen and high…nope that’s not Buddy. I’d know that dog sound anywhere. Shoot. I’ll just have to keep walking.Coming out of the woods after a long up I check my watch. Wow 2 hours and I’m thinking I have another ½ mile or so to go. There’s a dirt road up here some place. I might could walk it on up to the school? Throwing my head back I close my eyes and soak up the glorious sun, take a deep breath and release. I think I can, I know I can. I am where I want to be. I move on. Crossing the dirt road and the AT sign marking this a footpath only I know exactly where I am look out teachers I’m coming to school. Not more than a few yards up in the woods I hear a truck. Damn I should I make a mad dash back and wave my arms to ask for rescue? It’s a road scraper freshening the way for car passage. Maybe I could catch him on his return swipe…I keep on struggling. Down the side hill and I’ll be at the one last field to salvation. But then I’ll have to turn around and do it all over again. Let’s not think of that I say. Oh but the mind wonders when alone. I could build a snow bank and last thru the night. I have fire, I have emergency blanket, I have food water…it goes on and on. Shit girl you’re not destitute pick them sorry legs up and get to Lindamood and enjoy that hot lunch.And that’s just what I did. Oh did I enjoy. I enjoyed the beauty of this old place. A step back in time to the days of a one room school, farm land as far as the eye can see, and the gift of God bounty. Peaceful under Ed’s Place, the picnic area here. Hot soup at a proper table and sunshine to keep me warm while not moving. I call into home base to let Larry know I have made it thru round 1 and hope the return trip will be of some ease. That state truck does come back down the road and I have already checked my maps for other options but know deep down I shall ReWalk my way back to my car. It’s taken me a little over 2 hours to get here now let’s see how long to get back…Fueled up and needing to walk since my toes got a little cold I hit the trail wide open. Post holing for a bit and then back in my good tracks and some snow melt. Yes this is much better. Strides become long and a strong pace back up these hills. I clocked where my hour hike from the car was and I’m already closing in on it. Now if I can just get this hip to working right. Damn if it isn’t one thing it’s another. Foot feels fine today. No problems out of her. I stop to take off my yaks as they are gathering snow and slowing me down. I stretch out my hips, legs. Time to make some yellow snow…I squat to take a weee and wooops that snow is cold. Don’t lower down tooo far missy there’s no clearance. LOLPushing up that last hill the interstate sounds draw near, that big red house is back in view. Yes I’ve made it. Glad that girl broke the trail this hike back only took an hour and a half. It was a snow struggling kinda hike but one I’m glad I took.","Groseclose

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520547,"Just when I thought my hiker head count was dwindling away a surprise comes my way. My L-Train had derailed this morning but made me make sure the kids were coming. After last week’s snow hike he thought best I have company this go around. Yes they are in and then some.I arrive to pick them up and TJ’s sister, Leslie has decided to join in. What fun. Sweet Sixteen and never been…hiking…LOL. Here use my smartwool socks and do you have boots or shoes that are water proof. Snows a melting and the trail will be some icy and for sure wet. Ring ring my phone goes. It’s the long lost Greyhound and the Wildman. Their heading this way too!!!Gathering at our normal parking spot just off the road we have just enough room for our rigs around the snow pack. Thanks whoever plowed the turn in so we wouldn’t slide right down the hill into Kimberling Creek. Here put on these yak traks girls. I have mine on for just in case that side hill section is treacherous. Easier to put on now than in the middle of the trail. Anna and I get Leslie suited up. Sticks in hand, chains on her feet, gloves lets go. Now the fellas are traveling light. No pack needed for them. The Ratcliff men have only a water canister clipped to their belts. Eldest with his hiking sticks and the Wildman without. Knowing this is a short walk they don’t foresee any need to load themselves down with non-essentials. Nothing doing but to let our four legged friend lead the way. Maria has been prancing puppy style to get her paws in the snow and go. Anna does all she can to keep her focused on moving ahead instead of all around. I’m just glad to see the depth of the snow isn’t knee deep and we can move forward without too much stress.Warming up quickly I’m ready to get out of a layer. I didn’t go full on spring fling like Miss Anna sporting her shorts. She did fess up she had back up pants if she got cold. Good girl always prepared. The trail is still snow covered most of the way. Deep in the shadows and slicker on the north slopes. But the woods warms with sunshine and full of laughter. Our stories between all of us keep the pack moving without worry of pace, almost…. One mile in Leslie checks to see how our progress is. Are we almost there? Red faced and wide eyed she’s still having fun, good. We have all downhill from this point till we reach the Falls. “Don’t let her lie to you Leslie” Anna, TJ and Dustin throw me under the bus. Telling their tales of woe. With a wink and a smile I assure her they know nothing of the sort and just trust ole Lead Dog and enjoy the ride.Rambling to the depths of Dismal we can hear the roar of her falls. Ya see you made it, there’s the sign to prove it. Denny is quick to read the .3 miles more to see it but hey you’re practically there!We are led down the green corridor of rhododendrons to the water’s edge. Careful to not trust the snow pack and miss step you’ll be in the drink. Crystal mountain water runs over the shoals and finally the drop of the falls. We take in the beauty.Feeling like the need of yaks is passed we take them off and free our feet to kick up the snow. With all the tracks from our fleet the path back will be worn perfect for much easier hiking. Those big ol boots of them Ratcliff fellas sure helped too. Breaking a good sweat Denny leads us back up to the AT from the falls and turns over the lead to Maria and TJ. With a blink they are out of sight. The rest of us follow in line cruising our way back. No falling on this return trip Leslie girl. She has taken two which is more than our allowed group quota. Beginner’s luck I say. Snow melt has turned the trail to a path of water on the last switchbacks out. Yuk. Us girls tippy toe our way while the big boot boys slosh right down the middle taking over the lead. They have one thing on their minds and I think it called Miller Time! Breaking from the woods to the road Leslie’s happy to see the cars.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520859,"Trail magic shows up when you least expect it. It is planned by those you may or may not know; left to be found by a hiker in need or maybe to just brighten up their day. I was privy to some of this fine magic today.Come on Larry or we are going to be late. Anna, TJ and Maria are meeting us at the Christiansburg park-n-ride. We have planned to hit McAfee by 9am so we can get done before the Super Bowl and grab some pizza’s from Sals on the way to Regina’s (Anna’s mom). Her birthday is today! The kids have planned this hike for me as a belated birthday hike, what fun!Excited to hit the knob before it gets crowd I waste no time cruising down the highway. Say you guys look over the Sals menu so we can order on the way back. I get no response. “Do they even hear me talking?” Larry has ignored this same comment all week too. Hey I like to plan ahead ya know. AND boy does Larry know this….he has worked up his magic by telling Anna to line up this hike. She has contacted everyone in my hiking email chain to come surprise me today AND have dinner at Mountain View Italian Kitchen after. Pulling into the parking lot I look for a place to park while TJ says just pull up beside Bonnie and Jeff…huhh…Bonnie can’t come on this hike she has plans….I see a black rig like her’s but it’s not Bonnie or is it?? Backing in I still don’t see their faces. Well slap me silly it is them. Happy Birthday Martha and guess who else is coming? Captain, he’ll be here for dinner. Hot dog…well actually hot pasta. LOL As Gomer Pile would say, Surprise, Surprise, Surprise. Larry has put together some fine trail magic so now let’s get to it. Maria leads the way galloping up the trail on her third hike. TJ has her on a leash trying out the extendable kind which seems to work well with her. Out and back she goes walking double to ours. Us girls follow in the middle with Larry and Jeff running sweeper. “Yo Maaatha we sure surprised you!”Crisp air keeps us in our layers and gloves for a bit. Glad we are on the south side of the mountain with some warmth. This and the gradual climb will keep us plenty comfy today. Several hikers have chosen the early hours to hike too. I can really tell how the trail has been warn. Guess the movie A Walk In The Woods really did bring out more folks to see our local rock. The path is wide all the way to the top. Most summit paths start out wide and narrow as hikers drop off and turn back tired from their climb. Wonder if our boys will do the same? They have already planted the seed this might happen. “I’ve seen McAfee, I have cold beer in the car, come on Jeff wanna get the group photo now? Larry prods. Half way is the Catawba Mountain Shelter, 1.5 to the top. L-Train and Jeff huddle up for one last game plan, should we stay or should we go? Come on you’ve come this far why not? Wrong question there….you should have heard the reasons…I don’t even have the time to tell. Charging on we ALL head for the knob. Crossing the fire road and under the power lines we switchback across the old route. Bonnie and I reminisce of past hikes up and sorta miss the old route. Cold wind greets us as we hit the north side. Glad we haven’t had to walk in this all morning. Tinker Cliff shows her teeth and so do we for a selfie. Coming on to the fire road the kids have disappeared probably already closing in on the knob. Hope them fellas are still on the move.And are they…Jeff meets another Bonnie. Yep a chick from Maine looking to get her photo op like all others. Long tall Sally she is. Easy Jeff don’t try to keep up with her you’re gonna kill over boy…Larry knew Jeff would try to walk with her as she slows down to make conversation. Laying back keeping his own pace the L-Train watches with laughter. Yo Laary we almost at the top, huff huff, not much left in the tank Jeff is dripping with sweat. Bonnie from Maine has him leaving it all on the trail. She is in town for 3 months on a little vacation from her PT job in Portland Maine. Seems to be the thing to do as some of our other newly met friends are all doing the same. Work and little, hike a lot, work a little, reset. McAfee. What an awesome view. Rock ledge jutting out over the valley waiting for another to set and dangle its legs off to flirt with its heights. Don’t worry mom none of us did so. Marvelous, Magic, McAfee.We gather for our photos and work around other groups. Perfect amount of folks, all of which are very accommodating to the next. Too windy to stay here long that for sure. Besides we have Italian food ahead of us no need to fill too much. We invite Bonnie from Maine to join us. You never meet a stranger on the trail.Discussion turns to the quickest route off the mountain, fire road or trail. Doesn’t matter, birthday girl rules! AT rules, follow them white blazes boys. It’s all downhill right? Will they remember the 1 or 2 ups just shy of the finish line???Maria and the kids once again disappear only to be tracked by sounds of a bark in the distance. She meets her own new friends hiking with their masters up the trail. Settling between them and the sweepers I enjoy the trail and the magic it has given me today.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521559,"If you’ve been following my journals you realize by now I hike all different directions. One trip may be north and one may be south. Well today I decided to sample the trail in both directions. Pocahontas Road will be my middle point and where I plan to park. Lone wolfing has me planning for options depending on snow remaining and how my foot does.Looks like it might rain; it did sprinkle on my drive over. Warmer temps mean shorts today but I do have rain gear as back up, pants too. Pulling onto the dirt road snow packed ice has me driving slowly. No worries I can see the red clay from truck tracks before. I only have a few hundred yards before my parking spot and the white blazes. In fact I’m driving along the trail here since the re-route. Which way should I go first? Up to the fields or down to the River? I have hiked the Rice Fields side reroute a few times and it will make a good end of the day with lunch at the top. Having only tested just to the crest of the river side I am so curious of where the new blazes will lead. I love walking new ground. South it is.Snow covers this north facing slop, a good 5 inches. With the melt and refreeze I am able to manager pretty well only breaking thru to just my shoe tops. Probably could have used my gaiters and yak traks but oh well too late now, didn’t bring. Switch backing thru the rhodies to the crest of this knoll has me sweating and coming out of layers to keep dry. Besides I should break from this winter like trail once on the south side. Sure hope I get to walk along the river for a bit over here.Fire road trail nice. This should make for a quick pace. Uhhh and all uphill on the way back. What goes down must go up! Not much to catch my eye over here so I let me ears do the entertaining. Birds are singing their sweet “springs a comin songs”. A plane flies over, low enough for me to see the undersides. No it’s not Harry. That tail fin isn’t turned the wrong way. Celanese smoke stacks blow off their steam hissing throughout. Train Train….it’s whistle sounds and echoes down in the holler I am now walking in. Reaching the back side of the county land field I am lucky enough to avoid any foul smells but the water runoff is quite green. A sign posted gives hikers warning not to drink.In and out of snow I crest another knoll and there it is, the River. A mile’s walk left to the bridge. 460 traffic whizzes by oblivious to my presence. What’s this? A Christmas ornament! Somebody has celebrated this view with a shiny gold ball hanging from a tiny tree. Santa maybe?The bridge sign reads (north) 20.5 miles to route 635. That’s Captain’s road, Stoney Creek. I won’t be hiking all that today but good to know for next time. And also good to see I could possibly park here to start a hike or be dropped off for a lengthy hike. Well it’s all back up hill now folks. I’ll not go across the bridge to the Pearis Cemetery today. Would add more miles to this soon to be 12 mile day. 3 mile back to my car and then lunch at the fields.Get those legs pumping girl. You had an easy way down. Challenge now, 1780 feet climb. Head down and charging I see where I slipped a few times in the mud. Heck I feel my feet digging for traction. Love it! Steadily passing back past the land field I notice tree stands I missed. 6 to be exact. Wow this must be a hot spot for deer activity.Back at that snowy side before reaching Poco road I’m feeling pretty good. My foot is fabulous!! Not a twinge to draw attention. YES! With all this slipping and sliding it would have let me know if not healed yet. Hopefully I am on my way to 100%.Snack time as I pass my car. Nope don’t stop girl if you do you might get into that after trail beverage and not finish :o) Eating my pumpkin flavored luna bar the sun warms me to the feel of spring. The trail is all clear here. Snow free. Let’s see how long that lasts. Switchbacks. I count the minutes from point to point as I’m familiar to the new re-route. I’ll have it memorized surely since this is my go to hike for a good workout close to home. Forest road, 30 minutes from the car. 3 rocky sections and I’m almost to the water source and the section of trail I helped build. Gives me pride to know I did something to give back, even quite small in comparison to all the ATC volunteers and maintainers work. I say thank you out loud every time I walk over this spot. Snow is back, almost to the top. One last push up this narrow path. Ah the shelter, the fields, WVA! Wind rushing over me as I walk thru the grass and snow. What a view, vast and fresh. Feeling the sun’s rays on my back while seating enjoying my lunch I wonder where all the other thru hikers are today. I do hope they are having a time such as my moment here. A couple and their dog arrive too. We speak and turn quiet taking it all in. If only I had my tent I might just spend the night here I think….2.5 miles left. Looking over my shoulder one last time….I shall return, no telling how many times or from which way.","Pocahontas Road

You put a new trail in front of me and tell me all I gotta do is hike all of the parks peaks and get a patch I’m in! Jim knew it too when he asked the park ranger how long a loop was we planned to hike. 11 miles my friend and you’ll be added to the list of those who have completed our parks 5 overlooks. I couldn’t wait to get up and head south from mom and dad’s to meet Slim Jim. Coming into their place last night gave me an hour less to drive this morning. Sunny skies lead me down the mountain to Hanging Rock State Park. I’ve never hiked here but Jim has and has a loop hike planned for us.Buddy is fast to tell everyone we HAVE arrived. Echoing his coonhound sound off the walls of his new cab. Nice addition to Jim’s little truck. Buddy’s room so to speak. Wonder if he’ll lay down on that upper level for a nap on the way home? With this maze of trails I am no real lead dog today even though Jim does have me relegated to the front to keep Buddy moving forward. First destination is Moore’s Knob with its fire tower. On the way we notice these weird no moving people. Are they ok? Frozen in time? Dead? First one was setting leaning against a rock, back to us. Never moved as we passed by. Then another setting at a picnic table reading but motionless. Are they statues? Finally a third at another table which we walk directly past I have to say good morning for a reaction. Her head raises, thank God, they are alive. Come to find out there is a Hare Krishna colony close by. Winding around the lake we leave the parking access areas and venture into the woods and begin climbing step after step of rock. Nicely laid trail but what a work out. Buns of steel worthy. Glad to be doing this first thing. The rock tower appears ahead and opens up to a fantastic view over the county. Wow I can see all the way back up to Pilot Mountain. I’d recognize that rock ‘button’ any place. Several other hikers are here too and tell us they are with a local hiking group that hikes every weekend. Hey just like us. Jim fills them in on our adventures and those to come while I scamper up the tower for a view and photos. Short and squatty platform makes for a safe climb for me. I’m not much on those tall old towers that shake with every step. Sturdy and secure here. Peak 1 down.Second destination Cook’s Wall which will pass our third peak, House rock. Good two on one route. We circle down and around to Magnolia Springs passing several hikers and a few rock climbers. Lots of dogs out today but none like buddy. A couple of girls remembered him from the parking lot. They thought they saw us early but realized that wasn’t the ‘cool dog’ they whispered. You hear that Buddy! You ARE the COOL DOG. And many did love him. Every person we passed had to ask what type of dog he was. The only doggy close to buddy’s coolness was a little poodle with the rock climbers wearing a hulk tshirt and sported a hot pink Mohawk. Jesus loves everyone!Not knowing what time it is, is killing me today. My watch battery went out so I am without. Jim keeps track for us and clocks our times at each peak so I can write it down for our record. So in between I keep feeling like the day is getting away from us. Back up on a ridge sorta we decide to pass House Rock and return to it for lunch and clock our Cooks Wall peak. Wish the winds hadn’t been so cool here or would have been a great lunch stop. Grassy ridge and rocks with the trail meandering thru reminded me of New Jersey sections. Anyway we take a quick photo to mark our arrival and head back to for lunch. Peak 2 down.Lots of groups at House Rock having their lunches too. We find a place off to the side with a nice view of Moore’s Wall we had previously visited cool. Jim brings out his at home creation, BPG (Baum Proof Gear) kitchen style, dehydrated chili. YUM I did have a taste. Just add ½ cup water and let hydrate while you walk. Top with cheese and crackers and you’re ready to chow. I am trying a new tuna pack with jalapeno and plan to use this again. Peak 3 down. These great rock structures are providing a nice challenge today. 2 more to go Wonder what time it is?More ridge walking to connect us to the granddaddy of the all, Hanging Rock. But first Wolf Rocks. This path reminded us of Daleville’s Hay Rock section. The trail passes just behind the ledges for a good ways. I’d love to see the aerial view of these. We didn’t go out to peer over since we need to keep moving. We both have a schedule to keep for later. Peak 4 down.The trail turns super wide now. This must lead to a parking lot…well sorta…it’s the main access to Hanging Rock. Our path cuts into the main drag wide enough for a truck to pass and then some. Folks are everywhere. Coming and going. And again the most dog traffic I’ve ever seen on a trail. Big little it don’t matter bring them all. But still Buddy is the coolest! Kids wanna pet and girls ooh and ahh over him. Chick magnet Jim!Closer and closer we come to THE rock. This massive rock juts up tall like Dragons Tooth but much bigger. We have to wind around the back side to approach. More and more steps and people. “We’re caught at the Hillary step! Turn back Beck!” You’ll have to know Everest to understand. A few folks did turn back I think and some gladly pulled over for us to pass while catching their wind. Speaking of wind there was plenty once we made the turn for the final walk out to the actual overlook. Rock edges to carefully step out for a view or picture. With so many people not where I’d wanna stay for long. We exchange photo ops with another couple and capture another destination, our final. Peak 5 down and all before 3:00.My feet can say we have walked 11 miles coming off this overlook pounding the gravel treadway. Some are looking pretty tired just going up. There was even a bride to be heading up with her photographer and finance for that photo like none other. See Larry at least I didn’t put you thru that! Golf course baby. Anyway turns out Jim found her photos and it was awesome from the tippy of Hanging Rock. You rock girl. Now to return to the park’s office and turn in our time. No race today but I’d say it would be something others have done to see how fast they could claim each peak. Maybe next trip. Time 3:31. 5 hours and 50 minutes. 5 Peak Challenge over, stop the clock, hand over that patch, and let’s celebrate!","New River Bridge to Rice Fields

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522826,"Where to hike today? I need some place pretty close, some place with some trail history, I have a newcomer in the mix. Some place with an UP. Oh yeah gotta have that. Why not visit the Keffer Oak and Sarver Holler. That’s got it all.Setting up a 9 mile hike seemed an ok idea yesterday but today I’m feeling more like 7, been a little under the weather this week. I’ll run it by the Bonnie’s to make sure. Yep I have Bonnie Squared today. Two Bonnie’s you say how is that? Well you guys remember our hike to McAfee and the boys picking up another Bonnie on the way? That long tall Sally? She said she wished she had joined up for dinner at Ironto so why not invite her for another local hike while she is still in from Maine. Her time is growing short here so I contacted her for one last go on the AT in VA.Carpooling over from Newport we all agree cutting the 9 miles down to 7 sounds like a fine idea. Bon Bon was hoping I’d be sick, hung over, hobbled anything to slow me down on this day of all up to the top of Sinking Creek Mountain. Bonnie2 has heard the word that I’m a killer on the trail and not to trust me with mileage or trail elevations. Jeff and Larry and filled her head with falsities and Bonnie1 only confirms.Come on girls let get this show on the road and head for the Oak! The second largest tree the Appalachian Trail. I know it for a fact. I measured it before we went to CT/NY to compare. The Dover Oak beat our old girl by exactly 17”. Keffer 20’ 2” vs Dover 21’ 7”. I remembered it to be only a few inches when telling my hikers today. It’s easy to forget when you are wrong…Oh well ours sets more majestic looking over this pasture land than the Dover who sets along a side road with traffic only to pass him by without noticing. We can just stand small next to either only to wonder how long they have stood and how many hikers have graced their presence.Once thru the field it’s time for a few switchbacks entering the woods and then the long haul to the ridge line. Chattering along I have had my head down telling Bonnie2 all about the path ahead and times hiked past then I notice I’m rambling on to no one. She has stopped for Bonnie1 to catch up. Her little short legs just a pumping to make up the distance. Get the lead out you two lollygaggers. Snow dusted the mountain tops afar and by golly here too. Edging up into the rhodies this northside is white. Tree branches have a coating of the white stuff and soon begin to drip all around us with the increasing sunshine. Glad to be over the burn of the climb we reach the crest and enjoy flatter walking and can tell more stories between the three of us. Old man Sarver’s place is in about 2 miles more oh and we’ll have to walk down the .4 of a mile to it. Ya’ll don’t mind do ya? I get a few responses but none I can repeat. For now we’ll appreciate the Sarver family’s hard living up here passing by the mounds of rock stacked neatly to keep the orchard clear along the ridge. Still a nice coating of snow underfoot we reach the trail junction for the shelter. All clear on this side ladies. We can soak up the sun on our way down to relaxation. Bonnie1 gives a complete description of how we first came on this place and by the way was from a much harder approach….the Sarver Holler Side Trail…a knee to the chin type of climb that isn’t for the faint of heart. See I brought you the ‘easiest’ way my new friend. Sarver Shelter gave us a warm and peaceful place for lunch. We decided to take a look at the ruins and why not venture up into the woods and find the Sarver family cemetery. Just prior to heading for it all a man comes toting a board and heavy loaded pack. Why it’s Homer Witcher! Where’s your work crew Homer? They are some 15 minutes behind this 74 year old fella. Wife Theresa, son, his wife and grandboys are all on their way to help him put up a door on the privy. He has hauled in the drill, bits, and various other tools all on his back. He did remember me and our crew helping his maintenance bunch over at the Rice Fields relo. Who couldn’t remember that cold ass day and all the helpers that we and Va Tech brought out? Homer and his family, the Walking Witchers, hiked the trail some years ago, 2001. Father, daughter, son and wife all I followed via these same trail journals and the local paper, The Roanoke Times. Look it up a great story of them making it all the way to Katahdin! He says he’ll give it a go again maybe next year with his daughter, Cascade. We gotta run Homer so we can find that cemetery. It’s been 3 years since I found it last and with only my memory as a land mark might take us a few minutes. I’ll let you know if I find so you can check it out too I tell him.Traipsing up the mountain side with no path to follow is pretty hard work. Trying to avoid briars and brush I lead us up the best I recall looking for the grove of cedar trees which mark the headstones. Big Pine tree is my target and the rock piles along the way help. I see the cedars girls! We are only off location by a few yards. Henry Sarver from Company C. His daughter and wife laid to rest along with a stone or two of others. Someone has also taken the time to research the family tree and placed an etched cross with names and dates of those here. We pay our respects and head back for our climb out of here.Charging to the top I don’t stop on this one. The Bonnies come along not far behind. I think Bonnie2 is holding back actually. Trail runner and half marathoner I do believe she could hike circles around us if she so chooses. The WDBJ7 jingle sounds off from Bon Bon’s phone. What’s the message girl? “Channel 7 is reporting that I just died coming out of Sarver Holler” she huffs out! Ah she’s always quick with the wit.Snow’s about gone now and nothing but smooth sailing. We only met a few hikers on the way out. One being a thru hiker from Washington State name Eisenstein. He started Jan 14th and was awfully glad to see some sunshine and hopes to have a good day when he reaching McAfee Knob in a few days. He noticed all my patches which sparked conversation of miles hiked and those yet to come. Who knows maybe we’ll see you come New Hampshire. What goes up must go down and down we went. Did we really come up all this? Bonnie2 says next time she might just use those hiking sticks offered at the trail head. So you girls wanna go ahead and get that 2miles in we missed this morning? Ahh the tradeoff for the cemetery venture was good enough. Didn’t we already hike 10 miles? Or was that 12? Bonnie2 has become one of the pack.Resting our laurels on the rocks near our parking spot we toast to a wonder day in the woods. Here’s to making friends and sharing what the trail holds from our past and wondering when our paths might cross again.","Rt. 630

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523499,"Standing on Angels Rest a sound of a plane creeps in from the distance, a tip of the wings, hey I know that tail fin…it’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s a Mooney which means only one thing It’s Harry!We’ve come over to the new parking spot just off Narrows Rd, old 100 before the New River Bridge, a very good location and no worries from the neighbors for parking in a non-designated area. Topper is with me today. You like her name? This is Bonnie2 from Maine. She is stepping in to fill the shoes of my others not able to make it today. Rain or shine kind of girl like me. Last week we tabbed her with this title due to the ring of her last name Topham and she does like some strong IPA’s. I did mention she should try the Heady Topper, TJ. She is on the lookout for it as we speak. And before I leave the subject of names I’ll let you guys in on Bon Bon’s new trail handle…You know how ol Jeff tried to pick up Topper on McAfee well when Bonnie1 told him Bonnie2 was coming last week his ears perked up and a big smile came on his face. I do believe he might have been tempted…Swinger! I just love how names are born.So Topper and I are headed to walk some new trail. The section leaving the bridge hiking south is now routed thru this parking area and then across the road and up into the woods missing the small neighborhood walk right in folks back yard. Trail volunteers have cut a nice path to view a small waterfall and a rock wall section cut from the side of the mountain. Nice work! It’s a graded up for a good mile to Rt. 634 where we usually park. Views over town and the river could be seen. I pointed out where the trail would continue had we been hiking north over to Peter’s Mountain. Maybe you can hike that with me on a return trip to VA.Hitting the harder section of climb I am chatting away about the trail educating my new guest all I can. She asked for those hiking sticks today and plans to use on the return trip off. Being a trail runner and marathon competitor she has the legs for it but does want to protect those knees especially the one she blew out in her younger days of basketball fame. When an athlete goes down they get right back up. Pushing hard to get back on TOP life threw her a curse on that court but she charged on and took up the profession that healed her, physical therapy. Who would have known that job would send her our way and put her on this trail.After the switchbacks and all the trail talk I can possibly muster without losing my breath, mostly lies I’d say, I point to the marvelous view we now have of the New. Not much farther gal and we’ll be at the ‘rest’. We’ve worked up quite the sweat and taken off our wind jackets. Heavy skies still yet but no rain to really speak of just sprinkles. Rhododendrons, what does this mean Topper? We are at the top, the ridge, the end! Almost the end, did I mention there is still a slight grade to our next over look? Ah more lies!Taking the side trail out to our rock overlook I hear the sound of a plane. Nah it can’t be. Topper jumps up on the Angels Rest while I set up for a photo of her and then I see it…..de plane de plane….I know it is Harry. Telling Bonnie all about who he is and what he is doing we get excited to catch a glimpse of him again. Texting back and forth, hey both hands on the wheel Harry, we are heading for Wilburn Over look come back!!!Scurrying up the trail we lose sight and sound of him but keep the faith he’ll be back. Ah the ridge line, we are done with the climb for today now let’s just reach our spot for a snack.Wind hits our faces as we settle in for a set down on the ledge and watch for Harry. With our elevation and this wide open valley he should be able to fly at eye level to us. Cameras ready.VOOORRRUUUMMM he zips right over our head almost touching the tree tops around us. Shit I wasn’t ready. Roars of his plane hum out of sight then reappear with a flashing light signaling he has sight of his runway. Waving my yellow seat pad I acknowledge. Bonnie is capturing our flyby all she can. Wish we’d been fast thinking and had video going but we were just too excited. With a few more flybys for funzies Harry tips his wings one last time and disappears in the clouds. What a treat.Sticks and chicks, time to trek off this mountain. Still out in front of the rain we make quick time of it passing some things we didn’t even see on the way up. Where did that electric tower come from, I don’t remember seeing that tree, did we step of this on the way up? Goes to show time flies when you’re having fun and fun could fly by if you know the right friend. P.S. So long to our new trail friend Topper, she heads back to Maine Wednesday. Look for us gal as the VA Gang will be coming to your neck of the woods soon.","Narrows Rd, Pearisburg Va

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525263,"No Tinker Cliffs today folks, tooo wet! But not too wet to hike. Glad Swinger is up for it. LOLI was going to show the City Slicka, Carolann what hiking was all about. Get a real climb under her belt to the cliffs by way of Andy Lane Trail. She have an awesome view over to McAfee Knob which she had hiked a few years back. But with the rains setting in that would have been a dreadful walk and no views. Been there done that. So Bonnie has buckled on her rain boots and put on her pack cover to join me for walk in the rain.Sawtooth Ridge. The path less taken on the opposite side of the road of McAfee’s Knob, a pretty good workout too even with the trail maintenance to route away from all the ups and downs. We put on all our raingear since it has been raining the whole drive down. With a cold front blowing in maybe upper forties but betting we will chill with the dampness. Got my long johns on with shorts so will be more comfy walking under the rain pants. Bonnie is geared out too.Let’s hit it. The plan is to walk out the ridge and back to get our 7 miles in to validate our Ironto Italian Kitchen run! Oh yeah, we can change a plan to make a plan. Say where does this path go? Not too far out the way we come to a path I have seen before but passed up. “Bet this is the path the ATC started to connect the AT to the Homeplace” Let’s check it out? Bonnie agrees but not far down the hill begins to wonder if that was a good idea. “Say if we keep going can we just hitch a ride back from them?” (the restaurant) She says. Haha you keep walking. Besides it’s not really raining yet….Down Down about a ½ mile and the path dead ends. We can see it would have to go much farther off trail to hit the bottom land and then manage across the creek even before reaching the place. The ATC had to cut this plan short till they can get a contractor in to build a bridge down there but it’s in the works just long term. Ok enough of this time to return to the white blazes.By the time we reach the AT we have worked up a sweat and have to come out of some under layers but keep that raingear intact. You know the saying? If the rain stuffs on it will keep the rain away. Ridge walking turns to the sawtooth with many ups and downs over and over. Fog begins to roll over the adjacent ridge closing in on us too. Dampness covers us and then it comes….sleet. Wind picks up and we are totally in it now. Here Bonnie put on these BPG rain mits. Jim had made me some rain mits from an old sil-nylon tarp Captain gave me. Baum Proof Gear to the rescue and Bon’s the perfect female trail ambassador to test them out. I have my insulated rain gloves I have slipped on. Just a second thought this morning when packing up to come out in this mess. We have about a mile to go before we about face. I’m already wondering if now is as good a time as any to just turn around but we put our heads down literally and charge through this squall and make it to our named ‘spot’. Temps have dropped and we can now see our breath, time to retreat.Double timing it back we don’t stop but keep the chatter between us to keep time with our feet. Glad we brought extra clothes to change into just in case we are wet underneath. I have been much wetter believe me but still would like to stay dry come car ride and dinner time. Rain and sleet blow out with the winds and we return to the parking lot. A quick change of clothes makes for some warm bodies. Our raingear did the trick but the dampness in the underclothes is best stuffed in a bag than left on us. Quick Bon let’s jump in the car and turn on the heat. Here’s where the entertainment of the day really kicked in, parking lot people watching. We have some time to kill before the Kitchen is open at Ironto so we watch numerous people head out for McAfee Knob. Temps now 30s and cold. Shorts, tshirts, tennie shoes, no gloves or hats, cotton kills folks. Then they arrive, the weekend warriors. Freshly packed out from that local outfitter with brand new gear. Packs big enough to store small kids. When you have to back into to hoist on your back you know you are carrying too much. We video this performance for a good 15 minutes. Again, been there done that. Good luck hiking friends. Hope you learn from this trip.Rain? What rain as other head out for their adventure. Good to see so many hiking rain or shine.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525165,"My compass pointed north along the river to find this Viking. Makes since he’d be near water right?! He has been traveling swiftly across this white blazed path from the northern terminus since last December. Oh how I’d like to meet him face to face. Following on social media has fueled this desire to see this fellow who claims ½ Viking, ½ Thrill-seeker, 2/3 beard. A true warrior who has fought for our country and walked off his war on this trail and is now seeking more adventure, the first documented winter southbound AT hiker. Well nothing doing but to get up early on this Good Friday and head up the interstate to the James River. Slim Jim has helped me pinpoint possible location. No contact has us guessing Buena Vista or Glasgow so we go with me starting south of him so not to miss him. I have prepared an array of goodies for Easter Weekend. Candies, fruit, adult beverages, samiches and a down home cat head biscuit with a slab of tenderloin. I had one of those on my drive up, Yumm!Rain what rain…again. Last three weeks have handed me a wet morning. I can only hope the clearing happens when I arrive 2 hours from now. Jim tracks all means of contact from this bearded warrior but we have nothing much to go on but to assume he stayed at Maupin Shelter after his last sighting near Reeds Gap and Devils Backbone Brewery. He’s been trekking big miles, 30 at a time. Glad I don’t plan to walk with this man but for a short while as I be heading north to meet him as he hikes south to the James. Stepping into the woods the overcast skies keep their drops to themselves and I keep my rain coat in my pack for good measure. I’m loaded with magic just waiting to sprinkle along my way keeping my eye sharp for the right places to leave in case I do miss him on this 4 mile hike in to the top of Little Rocky Row. By the way this just happens to be 1 or the 3 hardest northbound sections of the AT in VA. Nice pick Jim, you know me well. Get your hike on HIKUPIT! Not a sole walking this direction from the bridge. All want to see the river and the longest footbridge along the AT. My quiet side has me enjoying the tributary waters feeding into the James. A peaceful lull soon to turn to quite the heavy breathing and heart pumping exercise. Forest Road crossed and shelter passed time to get’er done.I haven’t walked this section in several years but remember this climb with a heavy ass pack heading for Punch Bowl Shelter for an overnight. Man glad I’m not carrying that today. Switchback after switchback the trail turns steeper up but I can say thank you VA for your long switchbacks. Wish some of the northern states got this memo when building trail. Each corner I anxiously peer around hoping to see a beard walking my way. Shadows start to cast from the trees, blue skies baby. Bring it. I’m in shorts and short sleeves now heating up. Rocky row starts and I reach the cat bird seat looking over all of the river and onward view of Thunder Ridge and Apple Orchard Mountain which the trail walks along. Magnificent!!Hiking on to the trail junction sign of Rocky Row side trail and the AT I check my phone service. Bing. My hiking crew is looking out for the Viking for me but no news. Oh well I’ll just wait here for a few minutes and enjoy what the good Lord has handed me today. Posting a little magic on and around a tree it looks like the Easter Bunny has stopped by. 11:30 got go Viking I have to get off of here and back for a concert tonight mister. Hope you and “Paul” enjoy. (Viking is caring Paul’s boots for a stint on the trail from Harpers Ferry to GA. He passed away and never got to fulfill his dream of hiking the AT so his wife connected with REI store to call on volunteers to help with “his” journey) This Viking carries quite the load but not one that is heavy but one that is full and joyous in his heart. Here come Peter Cottontail hopping down the AT trail….Singing my way back over this 4 mile return hike I remember I have that biscuit still. Hummm what to do? Might violate a ‘rule’ but why not leave taped up on this tree in the shade with a note for Viking. He might enjoy this for second lunch and if not him a little animal is welcome too. Back off the switchbacks I check in the media man Jim on last time in hopes of some news.....Oh well it’s not meant to be but sure was fun trying to track you Mr. Viking. I still have some more magic to share so you look close around that river for some of Miss Maatha’s Mile Crushing Meatloaf and wash it all down with some Southern Charm on this Good Friday.","Little Rocky Row

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527447,"I couldn’t run south fast enough to miss those north winds Saturday. Woke up to a 19degree wind chill wondering what else I might need to put on or take for this planned southernly stroll. Heading for a place I’ve known all my life and have always wanted to climb on top of…The Pinnacle of Pilot Mountain. Hold on to your hats while I take you to this place.Nope it’s not on the AT and not even blazed. Instead trails are marked with plastic circles nailed to trees. Good thing they were nailed down too. What happened to March in like a lion and out like a lamb? It’s April now and the lion stills roars. At least temps are supposed to be warmer this way so we hope. Jim and I decided to give it a go here since we already canceled our camping adventure to Waynesboro. On overnight in these conditions not prime for fun. The BPG (Baum Proof Gear) Duo Stargazer would have been no match for old man winter’s last breaths of wind. Sure I have that big green monster sleeping bag but it can’t protect ya from a falling tree. Snow blew sideways as I drove up and over Fancy Gap mountain passing my folk’s exit with an inch of snow stuck to trees. Shit, am I running from winter or to it? Cruising down to Cana VA the worlds changed…trees had new spring leaves, sunny skies rolled over me and my car wasn’t rocking on the highway. Now this is more like it. Yooo Yooo, muffled sounds comes rolling into the parking where I wait on Jimmy. Buddy is barking in his new covered truck bed. He’s ready for a hike. Pilot Mountain State Park. You may have seen it on your drive to the beach. The Pinnacle can’t be missed driving down I-77. I have always wondered what was on top up thar and today this ol gal is gonna find out. Wooo, hold on to your truck door. The wind just about takes them off their hinges when we get out. Gusty. Surprised Jim is quick to put on his wool hat, mine already pulled down tight, my best wind stopper gear on. Again more folks here than I figured for. They are gearing up too. Looking over the map Jim shows me our plan for the day. Cool it matches my own in my mind after looking over a printed one I found online. Cover it all in a big ol loop. Hey do they have a patch for that? I do love my patches. Buddy leads the way sporting his fleece jacket. A wide flat trail winds around the base of the mountain with such a minor grade I hardly notice we are changing elevation. Bob People’s treadway. Tree cover helps shield us from some of the gusts but man you round the bend of the north side and bam hello!Reaching the ledges it’s time to climb. YEEAAHHH. Step after rock step. Now we can get some work out on and feel the burn. Real burn too, like sun burn. Perfect bring on the sweat. Views out to Winston-Salem can be seen. Those tall building stand out like soar thumbs over this flat flat land. Farms and Families below. Climbers and Scrambles above. Ropes hang from the Pinnacle’s top while rock climbers pick their way up the shear face. Jim finds the best sunny spot away from a possible falling body that might miss clipping in those carabiners. Yikes!Now this is fine…we are sweaty from our climb and can cool down here without getting chilled. Feels like 60 verses 30 or 40 degrees just moments ago. Buds and Blooms, Birds and Buddy. Can you see it, hear it?After a quick lunch we have just a few more steps up this Ledges trail before we turn to the northside. I catch one last view, this one of Hanging Rock State Park’s mountains. Cool been there done that. Glad Jim took me for comparison. These 2 parks are the only mountains as far as I can see down this way. Wow. Cold wind takes my breath as we circle the last side. I can hardly hear Jim if he speaks away from me. Now Buddy can always be heard. Tell it Boy! People come in from the upper parking lot. “Where’s your jacket young man?” My momma came out of me. Shorts and t-shirt looks chilled to the bone. Glad we are only passing over this spot briefly before retreating back below tree line. Good training for The Whites! Passing the camping section we wonder how they made it last night. Some tarps look quite the mess. Better them than us I say. We tried to out run them winds but they got us too. But they didn’t keep us at bay and seeing this towering landmark today.","Pilot Mtn, Pinnacle NC

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528540,"If you’ve followed me enough you know I have a few sections of the trail that are my go to’s. They’re not too far of a drive, a little off the beaten path, and have a climb with an awesome view. Andy Lane Trail is a perfect example. He’ll take you up one heck of a work out and then reward ya in either direction by connecting with the AT. We so happened to take the southernly flow to Tinker Cliffs.Another old standby to mention is my hiking partner today, Bon-Bon, Swinger, Chatter Bug, the trail names go on and on. She’s got my back just about anytime I don’t have a hiking partner if of course I don’t try to kill her with a terribly long hike. She may be short but she’s a powerful good hiker for her age, which I’ll leave blank for her to tell ya. When I texted to inform her of the location she was excited to hear about Tinker Cliffs but only hesitant on the loop. “So just how long is this again?? I’m only good for 22,000 steps and then I call in Harry for medivac!”Red buds and green leafing trees greeted us as we started down Andy’s lane. What a perfect setting for this spring day. No wind and no clouds. Somebody’s gonna get sunburned today and I don’t care if its me! Trail work has been done to move the path from a fence row to the field and thru a very nice pass through gate to keep the cow’s in. A water vegetation project is in place with hundreds of small saplings planted to prevent lowland flooding. Before this area could be a wet feet for sure section. Once across the foot bridge it’s all up hill from here so we take off the only layer we have on today opting for summer wear finally.Dusty cracked trail winds up the back side of Tinker Mountain. We can’t believe we’ll not have muddy shoes; it’s always muddy even on the climb. Guess all the wind dried everything up. Check out this great trail work too. Water bars and wooden step logs pegged to the ground on the steeper 2 climbs to make this more manageable. No more grabbing for a tree to pull up on or gearing back on the descent to keep from skating quickly down. (usually on your arsss) We ran into several weekend hikers coming out from their camping trips. Groups and then some couples. Before we know it scorched earth gap is before us and the white blazes. Bonnie is quick to calculate what the signs say verses what Martha’s says. So 12 miles you say. Yep! 6 mile loop from this point right her Bonnie. Ok let’s go.The half mile to the summit brought even more hikers our way. I believe all were thru hikers. They moved with purpose and sure footedness. Said our hi’s and they were gone. Most loaded down with that youthful pack size that says I can carry this, just watch. The leg burn to here is all worth it, just look!!! Tinker Cliffs never disappoints. Rock ledges lead with longing views back to McAfee Knob. Bet that place is crawling with folks. The parking lot for there was pretty full when we passed on the drive over this morning. A young gal is already here at 11:30 enjoying the solitude. Her favorite local hike she says. Having the cliffs to ourselves just a short hike on down the way we take advantage to get our best photo opts. I have dozens from here but there’s that one view that jumps out at ya that you have to snap yet again. Voices, here they come, more hikers looking to capture what we just have. Bet its more butterflies coming to sun on the rocks as my dad would say. Coming off the cliffs the trail winds thru some neat rock formations and then down down to Brickey’s Gap. We’ll hang a left here on the blue blazed trail to loop back around to scorched earth gap. This used to be the original AT, glad that’s changed or we’d be missing alot. The old farm building is still here, has a porch and picnic table for us to have lunch on. You can tell it’s still used for someone’s purpose. Has a hunters shack feel and farm use remnants. We can see Carvin’s Cove from here too. The water is really full and looks inviting. Taking about a 20 minute break we calculate our mileage to finish and give Jeff our eta. He’s on his Harley ride enjoying himself too. Nope I couldn’t get him on the mountain even with the hint of Mountain View’s Italian Kitchen to boot. Oh he’ll work that out and just meet us there he says. Bonnie also clicks her watch to see how many steps we have walked and if it is time to call in that air lift. We should back to the car between 2:30 and 3 don’t blow up yet girl.The loop path isn’t maintained a lot and has some blazes sort of hard to detect. Since not much travel back here we both agree not to hike alone. If something were to happen no one would pass us by like on the AT just on the ridge above. Lambert meadow means this is our reconnect to the AT again Bon. See the footbridge down there? The AT is just across on the other side. I love this area for camping opportunities. Never have but we should. One last climb back to Andy Lane/Scorched Earth junction. You got it in ya?Bon says….Well I remember this, it’s where Noni went down with a heart attack! Hope I’m not next!” Don’t worry Noni is still with us. She did have a heart spell, out of rhythm episode. Scary but she did her breathing routine and got herself back on time and marched out of here. Another tough gal.And off we marched, heat of the day, no shade, trees not leaved yet. Wew. Glad we drank our Gatorade for that extra boost. The gap draws closer and we see the big rock. Bon gives a big sigh of relief. 3 miles to go!A group of college kids approach. 2:00. Yep seems like the time they keep. Hike after 12:00 hitting that snooze button. Seeing my patches on my pack the questions come. Are you a thru hiker, have you been here, there, how many miles do you hike, the most miles, how many left to finish, is this the top, how much does your pack weigh, what’s in it…..It was forest ranger question and answer time on tinker mountain. I loved it. Bonnie stood back and feed fuel to the fire as they gathered around. VT proud this group was and none from VA. The NY boys did most of the talking, one with questions, and the other more of the trail knowledge guy. This was his triple crown day. He has section hiked to Dragons Tooth, McAfee and today Tinker Cliffs. “Good going dude. Now you need to bring NYs Lead Dog Squared here along and hike them all in a weekend. Ya’ll look me up on trailjournal.com, ya hear!”Saying our so longs we bounce on off Andy Lane with a little more kick in our step from all the pumping up those kids gave us. They were only good for short miles at a time they said and couldn’t believe we’d just hiked 12 miles today. Hopefully they keep on hiking and come back to this old standby and enjoy the AT much and me and my other standby.","Andy Lane Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533324,"5-8-16 Moonshine Road to Yellow Springs Village CampsitesMiles and miles and miles. Drive time took over this day but we finally parked the cars and got our hiking shoes on for the next mode of transportation. Slim Jim met me at the Christiansburg park and ride early this morning so we could make our push for Pennsylvania's Allenberry Inn. Shortcut will be waiting on us there and shuttle us up to Lickdale/Swarta Gap area for our hike south back to the place we ended up last year, Whiskey Springs. We have an hour jump on our original start time reaching Moonshine Road about 3:30. I have never been fond of driving a long day and then trying to hike but Jim is introducing me to it. He is a mile crushing machine and plans to break me in good on this trip. We hope to get in 9.3 miles before dark and if not we hike by head lamp till we do. Having packed in a sub for supper we don't have the worry about cooking once we reach camp. What better way to kick off this trip than with a toast of sweet pineapple flavored mountain elixir at Moonshine Road. A thru hiker came along at the perfect time to take our photo and be rewarded with the leftovers. Good luck'Mostly'. So long Shortcut. We'll see ya day after tomorrow at Darlington Shelter. She plans to do some day hikes while we make longer miles and then all 3 of us can rendezvous at the shelter and hike into Boiling Springs. Crisp air and sunny skies provide a great pick me up from the 6 hours in a car. Let's get this twosome going. SlimJim is packed about a light as I have seen on a multi day hike. 16 pounds in his BPG (Baum proof gear) dog food bag turned back pack. Shoulder, hip and chest straps made from lawn chair replacement ribbon. I am weighted in at 22. Damn happy with that too. But still can't touch Jim's ultra light measurements. I guess I could have left my new lightheart tent at home but just could pass up the chance to use it. Besides I am still warming up to the notion of true tarping that Jim has mastered. He made us a double wide version to test but I am still chicken. Like my little house around me yet. PA's elevation gain is pretty forgiving and today's miles look attainable before dark. One climb to Second Mountain will get our legs warmed up for a graded ridge line walk to camp. Not much water they say along the way but recent 10 days of rain should have those unreliable sources running. You ready to get your feet wet Lead Dog? Jim shouts back. Right off the bat a creek crossing. No foot bridge. Damn. Too deep to rock hop too. Ahhh but this big downed tree is the way. Time to test my balance. Knees knocked a little I won't lie. A fresh field walk between wooded sections brings us to the mountain. And before we know it we have crested it and come off to Rausch Gap. 4.7 miles done. Trail turns to a wider path, an old stagecoach route from the 1800s. Here's where Jim is at his best. Long strides with me take 2 for his 1. I feel my heel pain sneaking back in. Now that's the left foot. Then the right has its own issues with that nerve problem around the ring toe. It sucks but that's just that. Stepping over numerous little streams we decide not to gamble and miss out on these easy sources to reload before camp. Our sawyer squeeze filters are breeze. Fill the pouch, screw on the filter and squeeze for filtered goodness. We can't be far from camp. My feet tell me so. Jim has us moving faster than 2 miles an hour. Yes Lead Dog is following dog now. It's a good transition. Voices can be heard. A few fire rings appear. Camping. Clearing. We are here. I am good with settling in for camp too instead of trying to hike more miles tonight. 9 miles is enough don't way think? In 4 hours too. It is flip flop season and I don't mean the kind on your feet. The ATC planned a big hiker send off from Harper's Ferry to encourage hikers to start from midway along the trail instead to the traditional start at Springer Mtn GA. This help spread hikers about along the way. So we have dropped ourselves in the midst of FlipFloppers. They have been out a few week or more. 2 are camped here now. Nibbles and Cookie. They will hike north to Katahdin and then flip back to Harper's and hike south to Springer. No rain is forecasted tonight so Jim cowboy camps. I scope around for a flat spot for my tent. I like a little slope for my head to be uphill. Now I haven't set up my new girl since last year and it showed. Not the best display. I couldn't remember that magic hiking pole setting for a taught tent. Dang girl this looking like a girl set this tent it I say to myself. Oh well. No rain coming so I won't worry about it. Eating our subs we look over to map for tomorrow. Now comes some more of that breaking in again. ""Let's go on into Duncannon Dawg"". Huh that 25 miles!! Good lord. You are trying to kill me and my feet. Jim smiles. You're an athlete and love a challenge. I am tired just thinking about it. The sun hardly has time to set before we crawl into bed. I start to write in my journal but don't get a word on the paper. I just turn over and close my eyes. Leaves rustle behind my head. Steps? Jim are you up? More steps and more. Humm. Do I look out to see or just make some noise to scare away? I clear my throat and rustle around in my tent. The deer heard gallops away. Dreams fill the night .....","PA 443/Moonshine Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533476,"After a somewhat restless night I was ready to get up and make for that marathon march to town. Yes I am committed to this big arss day. Like the say the trail is just one day at a time of day hikes so why not make this one a record one for me. Jim has many of this marathon + days under his belt and is confident I can push thru. Glad he is. This little touch of Jurek running thru his veins has me testing my abilities and feet.6:00 and we are off and running. More flat trail to get ourselves warmed up. There is a treat of rain today but not till this afternoon and we do hope to beat it into town. Taking quick breaks at 3 to 6 miles helps to rest our feet and let the blood flow back into them. Snacks are abundant too.Now’s when things get a little off track or should I say lost… Say we’ll meet at the next overlook right Jim? Right next overlook. Jim is hiking on with a faster pace and this way he can hike his hike and I’ll hike mine and we have a location to meet. Uhhh which location was that again…..My mind registered Shikelimy rocks and Jim’s registered Kinter View. Both close in proximity but oh so far apart…..I reach Shikelimy, no Jim. I’m pressing pretty hard to catch up and don’t stop. I see no sticks or signs of him and assume he has just headed on and we’ll reconvene at the next shelter. Head down, I have a new pace going. I call it the Big Dawg Quick Step. It keeps me from making my normal longer stride which pulls on my two pressure points in the feets and keeps me moving rather fast. I feel like a speed walker, rolling heal toe, heal toe.Passing Kinter View I see the blue blaze off to a rock. Ah I won’t stop I’ll keep rolling and try to reel in Jimbo. I had already clocked the last mile between these two points in 15 minutes. If I can keep this up for the next 3 to the shelter I’ll be doing good. Shelter comes and still no Jim. Approaching lunch time I have to eat and assume he is doing the same some mile(s) ahead of me. 13 miles down wew I am ready to kick off my kicks. A thru hiker chic comes in same as me. Ready to rest her feet and get some water for her lunch. Water is so sparse up here and when you do come to a shelter it is 250-300 steps down embankments to get. She is from NH and tells me what a wonder place I soon shall be hiking thru. Be prepared for wind and cold she says no matter what day of the year and enjoy the vast views. KT was her name and I joke with her about this fast approaching 50 year old woman trying to not only complete all of my trail miles but also catch my current hiker friend. She laughs and says she is happy to hike alone but does enjoy company from time to time. Adviled up and refreshed from my lunch I head on for Table Rock, Jim might be there….then a call comes from behind me, I think….Maaarrrttthhhaaaa! Hootie Hoot. Hootie Hoot I call back.It’s Jim. What are you doing behind me? He is coming in Hot. “where have you been?” in a hard pitched voice that only my mother says when I am in trouble. Uhh hiking? Where have you been? He has been on a search and rescue thinking I had fallen behind him some place when I didn’t show at Kinter. Kinter! I thought we were going to Shikelimy! KT told him I was just ahead and he came a runnin. Note to self, Never assume where the other is… always look them in the eye when making that mapped out location the meeting spot. Say the name of the location and approximate mile from here to there. I felt awful when Jim said he had doubled back almost 2 miles looking for me. And then the train really started rollin!6 more miles to Clarks Ferry Shelter is the next stop the train conductor calls out. Roger that. Passing under the pedestrian bridge over PA 225 we met a strange two, Bonnie and Clyde. Trail talk is they have been on the trail since November. The looked like hikers, homeless but didn’t seem to have good trail sense having just come from Duncannon and were already out of food looking for a way to get to 1-81. We gave them the best directions we could by my map and left them to it. Wow that last stretch went by pretty face, numb feet and all. Time for a change of trail, Down.The Susquehanna rolls wide thru the valley. We meet several hiking coming out from the town of Duncannon telling us approximate mileage along the way. All it know is I see 4 miles on my map and we are hoping to close out this day at 6:00pmTrain Train take me on into this town….Jim runs down the last steps to try and catch her for a quick photo. I just hope to hobble across the tracks and not get hit by a damned ol train. Scanning for white blazes we make sure not to take a wrong turn and walk any more steps than needed. Wow this one wide river. The wind whips us around as the trucks and traffic race by. Doyle Hotel here we come….It was a long 2 miles of town walk let me tell ya. House after house we passed walking down the side street follow our blazes. I call mom to pass the time even. Yep 25 miles mom, yep we are crazy mom, yep I am tired mom, yep I am looking forward to that beer mom. Love you too mom. There she is, The Doyle, the famous hiker hotel run by a quirky couple to say the least for the past 15 years. Cheap, you get what you pay for that’s for sure. Roof, oh never mind those exposed electrical wires. Hot shower, oh never mind that rust coming from one of the faucets. Bed, oh never mind those sheets don’t look that fresh. Sleeping in my bag are you? Pat and Vickie do their best to accommodate, I think…They did make us laugh and a laugh much needed washed down with a few beers and a cheeseburger. Cheers to us for knocking out 24.6 miles in 12 hours! Thanks for the push Slim Jim. Lead Dog can do it and will do it again but first I’ll have that hot shower!","Yellow Springs Village Campsites

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533609,"Oh what a good night’s sleep will do for a girl. Feeling rested and ready for a short hiking day we take our time getting up and going. Another hot shower and check our social media. Shortcut has checked in making sure we aren’t pushing for Boiling Springs today after yesterday marathon. No way girl, we shall see you at Darlington Shelter and enjoy our camp night on the trail with you. She has been dropped off at the south end of town at 7:30 am so she has a big head start on us. Having a hot breakfast from Goodies across the street from The Doyle has us set up to depart about 10 or so. Spitting rain we aren’t in any hurry to head straight out in it and then get to the shelter early have to try and stay warm it these temps turn colder. About 50 right now but feels much colder with the dampness.Hawk Rock is the only major climb today. Really our only climb the whole trip. There’s always and the big drop off to a town and then the climb back out to tend with. We meet a few thru hikers coming into town as we leave. They are anxious for a hot meal and shower. Time for the rocks to begin they tell us too. Cove Mountain is known for a rough section and we are glad we only have 11 miles today so our feet won’t blow up. Hawk Rock Overlook is at the crest of this mountain and the many stair steps have us warmed up in a hurry. Rain jackets off. This area reminds me of our Devil’s Marble Yard near Natural Bridge. We wind around the mountain and top out for a nice view back over town. The heavy skies make photo ops pretty dull and with the graffiti sprayed around takes away from this nice location. A local and a Flip Flopper are here and tell us of their journeys. Rock cobbled path now leads us across Cove Mountain for a good 6 miles. Meeting those hiking north they are pretty bitter about their day having walked more of this than us to this point. Bitching and under the collar comments as we pass them by. It really wasn’t that bad we didn’t think. A lot like some of our ridges here in at home. You have to make an effort to place your foot between the pointed rocks and just keep stepping. Slows the pace but manageable considering what these guys will be facing farther north. Passing by Cove Mountain Shelter without really even knowing it we have no other options for water. That’s ok with this cooler day we aren’t sweating anything out and have been told Darlington Shelter does have water. Stopping for lunch we check in on Shortcut where abouts and she is a good hour ahead of us the hikers say. Olive Oil and Popeye had talked with her and had a good idea who we were before even asking. They were thrown by Lead dog not leading and ask why.. I laughed and said I get called Big Dawg with I relocate to the rear. Coming off Cove we roll on over to Blue Mountain and actually have a few switchbacks for a change and leave the mostly rocky terrain. Jim gives a shout that the shelter is up ahead. Wow we are already here. Now this was an easy day. Feet are still tender but that’s hiking.Shortcut comes from the shelter to meet us since we are hollering out to her. Some fellows are sleeping. Have been for a couple of hours she says. The guys have all bunks taken and Shortcut has a top bunk for herself. Its early evening and we have time to kill visiting and setting up our tents. Jim shows off his Stargazer Duo tarp. Think of sleeping under a giant sheet of saran wrap with plenty of ventilation. More than ample to keep dry baring no high winds. Very sturdy and quite the conversation piece. Another hiker, Walkman, comes in and sets up his hammock. Older fellow with many years of trail miles and knowledge. This shelter had all the types of hikers represented tonight. The thru-hiker and his dad, flip floppers and us section hikers. Conversation was plenty while a fire was built and suppers cooked. Say what’s in the bag Jim? More beans? Watch out that protein shake matched with rehydrated beans might make for a blowout. His stomach told us so over the next few hours rumbling and growing as if not ever fed. The Taj Mahal is waiting… That’s the name of this fancy like privy. Two seater in a double the average size building with a pull weighted door system.Let’s have a toast! To Shortcut turning 72 tomorrow and still busting out miles along the Appalachian Trail. Bottom’s up, ahh. Happy birthdays are shouted and cheered. Say I’ll give you my bottom bunk a fellow says. You deserve to have it. No way, Shortcut is good on top! LOLHiker midnight approaches. We three have an early start guys and miles to make tomorrow. Good night, sleep tight and don’t let Shortcut bite.","Duncannon- The Doyle

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533793,"No rooster needed to get this gal out of bed. Nature calling does that for me every time. I tippy to back behind my tent scanning my red lite head lamp for a big ol tree. Red works well around camp/shelters so not to disturb others while sleeping. No bright lights flashing in the night. 5ish now and some fog about. The walk back was somewhat of an adventure. Humm which way is my tent? The burgundy color doesn’t pick up with red light shining thru this fog. Maybe the reflective tie outs will show themselves with a little white light. Bam there she is. All I could think about was the story line of “ hiker lost while shittin’ in the woods” Not realizing our close proximity to civilization when bedding down last night we were quite surprised at the noises in the night that developed. Planes flying over every hour or so and the noise of the interstate. There was a slight snore from the other campers but none to really speak off. Shortcut said she slept fair.Packed and ready for town we are off. Wanting to walk a little with Shortcut this morning I take the rear so we can chat. Jim is anxious and ready to step off his 1300 mile mark of the trail this morning. He has it noted at the road crossing of PA 944. There is a tunnel under the road there and brings us to the bottom of Blue Mountain. Then flat flat flat by the profile for 12 miles into Boiling Springs. Today’s hike for Shortcut will be 14.5. Jim and I will stop in town for lunch and then roll on another 6 miles to Whiskey Springs where we left off last year. Another big day head but we all are pumped for it.Rocks have somewhat subsided and the feet are happy to have easy walking. Still a rather cloudy day as the morning passes and thrilled to have no rain. Jim pops on down the trail and readying himself for the big moment. I remember hitting half way and what a feeling that was. He has his rocks placed out reading 1300 miles. Shortcut adds her touch and we snap the moment on top of the tunnel. Hip hip hurray. Now let’s break for town. Passing the ATC maintenance building we take a little break here for second breakfast. A worker lives in the house here and then there is large barn turned into storage for tools and equipment. Even had a port-a-john handy and pump spigot for water. Nice.Oh Shortcut we will see you at Whiskey Right? She has her car parked in Boiling Springs where we will drop our gear and slack the remaining 6 miles after we eat in town. “Hope you guys aren’t waiting on me too long at the road” We won’t girl. Pizza will have us slowed down by then. Jim has us targeted to reach town by noon. Highways are crossed and fields and fields of Pennsylvania farm land. I-81, US 11, PA Turnpike. Tractors roll thru the fields and farmers work their lands. Corn, barley, grasses. Hello Mr. Cow. Come babe, Come babe. The little ones gallop over to the fence lines to check us out. Touching their heads they are tame from many visits by passing hikers. Trindle road brings us within 4 miles of town. Break please.Feet ache but nothing a little aleve won’t cure. My honey almond peanut butter wrap with banana chips is totally walked off. I dig for my spam and taco bell sauce. Jim’s having more beans and finds he has misplaced his spoon. Bet it’s at the shelter or on a log someplace. I dig for mine. Hum where did I put it? Is there a spoon bandit amongst us? Ah yes used with supper last night and put in my cook pot. Usually keep in my drinking mug for occasions such as this. With the threat of rain we don’t set long. Both of us are eager to reach town and enjoy a good hour long break at Anile’s.More field walking with a few boardwalk sections to break the scenery up. We are moving fast. Step for step this time. I have my second wind under foot marching to Jim’s beat. Not using sticks now no time for them to even touch the ground. Locals and hikers alike are pasted and chatted with. Reaching the edge of town two gals are standing at a street corner packed like hikers. We stop to see what’s their plan as they look like they are waiting for someone or direction. White blazes this way ladies. Eye balling Jim’s puppy dog pack they have to have a picture with him. Suck it all up Jim you deserve it big guy. Come on man I’m hungry no time for this school yard pick up. Dropping our packs we walk in to Anile’s. Aromas flood my senses. Herbs, spices, pizza Ahhhh. We are seated in a corner booth while the locals are finishing up their lunches. Owner and waitress are most accommodating asking if we need outlets to charge phones. I’ll have a big orange drink please and go wash up. Jim settles in on coffee since he is off the sodas. Glad they didn’t serve alcohol or I’d for sure had one or two which might have made the upcoming miles a little groggy with all this pizza. It was amazing. Fresh from Italy. Then the coolest moment of all, trail magic. When you least expect it, it appears. A local fellow came over to chat asking our direction and where we are from. Telling us all about the history of Boiling Springs and its connection with helping slaves escape thru various underground tunnel in town, he left us some magic. When the check came he had paid for our meal. A complete stranger, friendly and generous. Makes you smile inside and out. Thanks man.The surprises keep coming as we walked out the door to get our packs Shortcut comes thru the parking lot. Amazing! She was not as far behind us as we suspected and is ready to show us where to drop our pack gear for the slack. We cross over the picturesque bridge by Children’s Lake and look in on the Mid Atlantic office of the ATC. Hey didn’t we see you at the other office we ask? Sure enough the same guy was hard at work between places. Happy trail ya’ll we got 6 more miles to get so gotta run.Dumping out our packs we take on the shell and water. Raincoat for just in case. With 5 inclines to conquer this will be the toughest part of our day yet. Shortcut will pick us up in a few hours giving her time to check back in to the Allenberry, shower, and maybe a nap in the car while waiting. Graded nicely again the trail isn’t too hard. We move fairly fast with Jims lead meeting a few hikers heading for town and beyond to Carlisle where there are more hotels and accommodations. Boiling Springs is more of a quant vacationers town. There are no hostels just the Allenberry with a hiker’s rate and it looks to be going out of business soon, it is up for sale. Quiet now out here. Just counting the hills till we can drink some Whiskey! We plan to toast to Baltimore Jack a trail legend that passed away in the last week, RIP my friend) Rock scramble we must be getting close Jim. I remember the likes of this on the other side of the road. Come on Lead dog you take us to the car. Graciously Jim steps aside for me to take the front position. Hey man you got us here you should carry on. Nope take it girl and I did. Clicking thru the rocks we recount our journey and what is next this way and farther north. Plans spinning faster than we can express. Shortcut pops from the car all fresh and ready to deliver us back to town. We step from the woods.. its time for a taste from these Whiskey Springs. PS Oh did we taste from this watering hole and then others back in town. Boiling Springs Tavern then on to Allenberry’s pub. Both small but large with friends. Crossing our own milestones we did so together and that’s what makes hiking…well hiking.","Darlington Shelter

We dropped the packs and reloaded the cars with goodies and costumes for the weekend. Can’t miss that hiker parade either!The weather was unpredictable again. Always have a day of nice sunshine, then gets cold, oh and always rains and gets colder yet again. But we prepared for all the above and threw up our tents and packed the necessities to get us through. Host, Tom and Sandy Davenport always make us feel welcome providing food and fire. Our regular yard friends, Sale and John and Jan Liteshoe are always a good time. Look forward to visiting with them every year. Say Mary Sue where are you?We walked the vendor lines, bought gear, and tried to win gear. We rubbed elbows with currents hikers and saw those from our past. I found my hiking Viking too. Glad to actually meet him in person and yes he did remember me and got some of my food I left at the James River area. Yeah!!Saturday we dressed to impress marching in the hiker parade, water guns locked and loaded. Some got wetter than others. What fun. They say one of the biggest parades in history of the event. Glad to be a part of.Warming by the fire pit on our last night we told stories and sipped our favorite elixirs all while hearing the drums from tent city in the distance. I’m sure that fire ring was wild and muddy as ever. Our fire flickers out, time for bed, nothing good happens after midnight….So long ya’ll time to go back to work next week.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538004,"You never know what will be in store at the top of the highlands in Grayson County. It can be 80 in Marion and 50 on this mountain. Today Bonnie I and are watching the temperature gage in my car drop but thankfully not by a lot. Sunny skies abound but the wind looks gusty. We step out of the car and hold on to our hats and maps.Getting an early start for this 2 hour drive we are here at 9:30. The backpacking parking lot is full; we see the cars below from our parking spot just off the road shy of Massie Gap. Betting the AT spur trail is by the backpacker’s parking we head down the bank looking for it. I have never hiked this side trail and wanted to check it out. Follow these blue blazes Bonnie for almost a mile to the AT.I like your top by the way! We are dressed like twins sporting our new tops we bot at Trail Days. Say you got those new undies on too? Yep twins to the core! And those we ran into noticed too and gave us the thumbs up. Planning to hike a loop I didn’t pick the 4 or 5 mile climbs up to these highlands to spare Miss Bonnie that grunt work. I’ll get my miles in just the same by pushing her through these rocky sections and do some ups and downs to build the legs. 12 miles is a good work out and she is quick to tell me hope we don’t have to take any unexpected side paths. “you get your training in Martha I’ll just hike along”Birds and blooms lead us up the spur trail. Rocky and well maintained. Golden rod and bees. Campfire rings and scenes. Wide open we break from the woods to the grasses. A nicely labeled post gives all the coordinates north and south along the AT and the various upcoming side trails. Know Bonnie hasn’t been here in a while and I’m not all that familiar either I show her our planned trip mostly of the AT and then a connecting trail, Pine Mountain, which will make our loop. South we go, hikers coming shortly after we turn on the AT. Mostly thru hikers this time of day. Another reason I picked this part first. Most of the day trippers will hike from Massie Gap up to Rhododendron Gap and Thomas Knob Shelter on to Mt Rogers. We will avoid that traffic jam by hitting Rhododendron Gap early. Little groups of backpackers scatter the rocky bumps in the openness. We can easily see our destination after each rock scramble. Wew glad this wind is blowing or we’d be burning up, Bon says. Just a few high clouds shade us as they pass over head. Duck! It’s the Fatman’s Squeeze. The trail rambles thru this rock formation with little room for person and pack. Ah the tricks of the trail. More blooms begin to thicken. That’s why we came, to catch the peak. By looking at the color of the blooms we think this happened early in the week. The dark pinks have faded a bit to a lighter pink. Still stunning just the same. Junction signs are plenty at the cross roads. Kids gather around resting in the fields and backpackers crisscross in bunches. We helped with directions when those passing looked confused and frustrated on their where abouts. Come on Bon let’s get out of this hot spot.Pine Mountain Trail led us from this high traffic area to a peaceful floral section. Twisted limbs hanging with bloom surrounded us. Petals dusting the ground along our path as if dropped just on our account. Then our first close sighting came… the ponies.. Another reason we came. Standing grazing in the fields protected with more shrubs and blooms from the winds they ate unstartled by us. We crept closer and closer. Look a colt. Blonde Babe..Laying back in the grass his head resting asleep or playing chicken. Closer we get almost in arm’s length. Mom looks between long strands of her mane to make sure of our intentions. Easy girl we are friendly. Taking our last photos we exit quietly.Ah a trail less traveled is always nice. We did enjoy our time in the shade and the smells of Christmas pines before coming back into the AT and the white blazes. Lunch was at this junction in the field while looking over our map and estimating time of finish. Very warm now but that breeze is helping control heat and bugs. Ah the grass feels good on my bare feet. Bonnie kicks off her shoes too. New ones by the way. Another Trail Days purchase. She likes this new brand over her heavy boots. I decide I’ll put on my new support sock for my heal problem. It has been biting and now’s the time to test this piece of gear. Another new item I tried was sundried tomato hummus with olive oil on a sundried tomato wrap with dried raw veggies (green beans, carrots, potatos) salted and crispy it was great. I’ll pack this on my big trip. Just add some pepperoni if need more energy food. Yumm Good. Halfway finished we have 6 more miles yet to go. How’s your water holding Bonnie? She had forgotten her Gatorade but no fear I have my water filter and some powdered Gatorade. We can fix this up at Wise Shelter a few miles away. In and out of the woods and fields, up and over rocks and roots we go. Many hikers we saw this morning we are now seeing again. Some are startled to see us and wonder hey, how did they do that? Freekie Fast, that’s us. A gal comes toward us looking distraught. I have to ask…She is out of water and separated from her group. She remembered seeing us this morning too and asks if we have seen her party in front of her, we would have passed them. No we didn’t I say. She is headed for 603, Fox Creek finishing up their 3 day hike. Her friend has the water filter. Out of water we pull out our stash and share ½ each this gives her a liter of water to get to Orchard Gap Shelter. About to cry I let her know she is just fine. You are only a couple of miles from more water. You stop at the shelter and ask for another hiker to help you, they will. Lots of hiker we saw heading to this location. Hey smile now, there may be trail magic at the road. What’s that she asks? Oh girl magic is when you least expect it and your needs are provided for. There may be a few cars there and they might have a soda or such to cool you off. Not to worry Susan, you’ll be just fine. We’ll tell your friends we saw you if we see them.Lesson learned my friend’s keep some sort of water treatment with you at all times. Drops could have helped her as we stepped across 3 small run offs from the mountain shortly after leaving her. We also met her friend only 10 minutes behind Susan. Call out as you walk toward her I’m sure she’ll love to hear your voice :o) Knowing our water source is a mile off still yet and we are running low now I see a prime spot for us to resupply. Sawyer Squeeze to the rescue. Mixing up the Gatorade Bonnie shakes it ready while I fill our platypuses. Good cold mountain water, nothing better. More and more hikers now while we pass thru the Scales. Hazy skies hindering our views but we still make out the big mountains afar. Closing in on the shelter another call for help comes our way. Hey are you guys section hikers? My wife has a hurt knee. He was carrying her pack over top of his and the 3 kids loaded with their own. They are still having fun but mom looks worn out hobbled holding on to her stick. There is a camp ground just down this hill guys and a sign for Grayson Highlands State park. I’m sure a ranger can help. They had asked for a ride to Damascus which was more than we could deliver. Leaving them out of ear shot Bonnie giggles and says “ya know if I’d known this was the danger trail I just might have stayed home”. Reaching the shelter we take a quick break for our last push to the finish. No camping allowed. Two ladies come over to confirm this is so, yep that what the sign says. But hey I saw some nice camp spots just back at the creek. You should go there I say. Easy access to water and gonna be nice tonight for tenting. Good thing you know this place Bonnie adds. Well I just take what the trail gives me and follow my maps. We tell a bunch of girl scouts from Kentucky the same news as they approach the shelter from their long day. Evening sun leads us thru the last rocks and turns before I finally see our junction from this morning, The AT Spur trail. Bonnie is excited as am I. I felt it was close but you just never know till you see it. Walking out of the highlands we wonder where all our troubled hikers ended up for the day and can only hope their ending is happy like ours. 2 by 2 more hikers come up the spur. Say you guys ready to get your fun started? Oh yes they say with big smiles and anticipation of their adventure. Happy Hiking in the Highlands!","Appalachian Spur Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538921,"Bonnie and I had such a good time last weekend we had to come back. This time we brought our fellas to share the views and ponies with or and help us with a shuttle. I need to get some climbing in and a two car drop takes way too long in this area so we had the boys drop us off at Fox Creek, Rt. 603 Troutdale. Girls will hike up four miles and hit the highlands for a repeat. Boys will drive to the top and well…who knows how long, if at all they will walk. All I know is my car better be waiting on us at Massie Gap and at least have one cold beverage left for me. The Swinger instructed her half with the same.Another sunny day ahead. Trees sway in a cool breeze when we hit the trail. We’ll warm quick but nice to have this natural A/C blowing. I tell Bonnie of my various hikes up this way and just last year’s 16 mile look with SlimJim on another prep hike. You’re not gonna make me do that she asks. No not today. Last night’s rain is evident with the brush run off along the path. Roots and water bars saved a full wash out. See Vermont crew members these maintainers get it done. “Virginia trails are the best” and yes I am partial. Bonnie seconds my preaching. Even a Chicago hiker agrees. He is down this way on a vaca hike with buds, having thru hiked in 2014. Almost retirement age and ready to relocate to Damascus. Gonna bring the little women down for a preview and shop for a place. How cool. Most of the hikers we meet on the way up are thru hikers. All with smiles and making quick on their descent. Talking ourselves right to our first junction I quiz Bonnie to see if she knows where we are. Pine Mtn, Yea we were just here. And which way to Rhodo Gap? Ummm as she rolls her eyes up for a mind review. Walking off our path into the field she is quite perplexed. Why are we not taking a trail? You know where you are going? I remember the same feeling when Jim introduced me to this location. The Crest Trail. Runs parallel to the Pine Mountain Trail both reaching Rhodo Gap in 2 miles. A wide horsetrail, rock and gravel, with no obstruction of view. Clearer today too so all the mountain ranges surrounding us can be seen. Wind still blows but feels mighty good. Low growing bushes, blackberries, and ponies. Yes we just got on this trail and they were in the woods feeding. Horseman come past and other campers from the night before. Wondering where the boys are keep our pace in hopes to maybe meeting at the Gap around 12:30. My guess is they will hit the trail about 10:30 and would be at the Gap by 12. They’d walk 3 miles to our 6. Big Whiskey and the L-Train won’t travel too far. Their plans are to take it easy, see a pony, and we walk to them. Pushing Bonnie a little on this easy graded trail we arrive at the Gap by noon, 30 minutes ahead of time and waiting on his are the ponies, no boys. Not surprising we laugh. Taking a little break for pictures we get to know our little fellow we met last week some more. Yep that same colt was with his mamma and others. Soft to touch he nibbles at my shorts. More hikers come in to pet the ponies.Having a decision to make on our next more we look over the maps and make our plan. Hike on to Thomas Knob Shelter and then about face for our return hike to Massie Gap. This will cut the summit trip of 1.2 miles to Mt Rogers. We’ve both been there and with there not being an overlook out, just a forestry GPS locator marker, we decide not to make them fellas wait too long. Don’t get me wrong it is worth a trip, the Hemlocks, the notion of hiking to the highest peak in VA but hey we have not only our fellas to meet but Tom and Sandy too. Food and Friends later so we gotta go. Following the white blazes to the shelter was some of the prettiest walk today. Pedals lined the trail once again. Pink and Pretty. Shadows and Sun. Views over Wilburn Ridge, rocky and craggy. Mt Rogers’ pines and pinnacle. Helping more hikers with direction we keep a few wonders from biting off more than they can chew and point others on with reassurance they are on the right path. I even asked for confirmation of my path on the Crest Trail when a junction sign didn’t quite give me confidence of direction it was pointing. Thanks to the horseman there.Thomas Knob Shelter wasn’t running over with people. Our early arrival on a Saturday has assured us of some tranquility. I show Bonnie the view from behind and Mt Rogers to our right. Seems like a rocks throw from here but is half mile away. Returning now to Massie Gap we will rewalk the AT we walked last week. Funny how you don’t remember all the beginning of a hike sometimes. Each rocky section we went down Bonnie would say did we come up this? We didn’t walk up this did we? The new perspective gave us an open view over more fields, ponies and ridges. Awesome actually. More and more people coming in from the gap beginning their adventures. Pack of girl scouts from Lexington excited when I asked if everyone was having a great time. Oh and this is hokie country get those UVA caps off. Good laughs. One pack leader was from Christiansburg. Small world. Big packs and loads of people dotted the landscape but not our boys. Come on Bonnie they might be over this next hump. Nope. Seeing the cars along the road I spot mine, hatch up. Humm, wonder which one is stretched out in the back? Coming down the last part of the connector trail a young couple says, Hey you look like you know something about this place. How do we hike this loop? Love it. They have a park map and day supplies. Bonnie chirps up and says that’s the loop we hiked last week. Show’em. Giving them some advice when they reach the Gap, I say make sure you have enough time to go on from there and complete the loop. There’s water here. Do you have a filter? No but he is supplied and his sweetie is all smiles. Happy trail and ya’ll come on back for some more. Big Whiskey flags us down. L-Train is chillin in his crocs eating downing his pbj samich and a brew. Did ya’ll even leave the car? Proof has to come from photos of them actually on the trail and with yes some ponies. By the looks of the location I figure they got about 5.5 miles in. Not bad for these two fly byers. Big talk of big climbs and breaking a sweat became hard to believe by the time the tale was told. Guess you guys will just have to come back for some more.","Fox Creek, Rt. 603

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540853,"All excited to get my last hike on before we head north I picked an old standby – the Rice Fields. Been there done that but it’s always a wonderful treat to see the view over into West Virginia and today I’ll walk on farther to another sweet spot called Symms Gap. I haven’t hiked over Peter’s Mountain, that’s the ridge line walk between both points following the boarder of both states, since my ice walk a few years back. Boy was that a surprise that trip! Wonder what surprises are in store for me today…..Summer time temps are hear, I am sweeting before I even hit the trail. Humid. Love it! Leaving the dirt road of Clendening I head up the trail, the re-route I told you about from previous write up, the reroute needed due to the Pipeline. Trail travel has made it look like it’s been here all along. Wow I can’t believe it. And now having hiked it several times over I can almost say where each turn and landmark lies. Jeep Road, water source, that abrupt up before the shelter.The water source was running nicely. ATC workers put in a long pipe right out on the trail for easy access and fill, very nice. My first hiker sighting for the day here too. They look lightly packed and move on quickly after getting a drink. I close in on them on the climb up to the shelter.Blue skies filter thru the trees giving the illusion of the trail walking to the heavens. Better than the alternative huh? :o) These TN two are section hikers, Birthday Girl and Gamut, like me out to get some miles in over this long weekend. They are fairly new to the trail and have about 900 miles done. Virginia is in on the radar to finish this year. Starting from the Jeep road this morning they are headed to Captain’s tonight. Yeah! Tell him hey and grab a soda from his hiker stash. Zip on in! They are excited to meet this trail legend, Yep that’s what they call you dude. Their southern draw matched up well with mine as we chatted for a good while. I’ll see you guys on my return trip from Symms Gap.West Virginia is a tad hazed over this morning, 10:00ish. Grass thick as I walk thru it, feet trying to find the trail, wet. Heavy dew can’t dry in this humidity. Thorns and briars have taken over the upper section of the field just before the tree line begins. Angel’s Rest to my right, hazy too. Fields to cobble rock now on this ridgeline. Once I pass the cell tower and the powerlines I’ll be out of this stuff. Bees hum along with the powerline’s juice running thru their veins. Line views are nice for the openness but obstructed view for photos as you can imagine. Reaching the next water source I head down to check it out. Our little sign is long gone, H2O. But orange tap marks the spot for easy reference. Campsite on opposite side of trail too helps to keep this a frequent attraction. Another tube, not a pipe back into the earth like the previous but works. I’ll use this cold water for my lunch Gatorade treat. Loving these new powder packs of energy.Coming up and over the little knoll from here I have my head down deep in my thoughts and then I hear this commotion off to my right. Turning my head I get the backside view of a bear. Tail tucked, hop hop and it’s over the bank out of sight. Heart beats fill my ears, my breaths quicken, and my eyes dart from tree to tree scanning the whole area around me. Holy Shit, Holy Shit, that was intense. Surprise Surprise Surprise, Gomer Pile would say! Now I’ve seen a bear before, couple of times actually. But being alone and not aware it was watching me did give me bit of a fright. The next mile my thoughts were of me being attacking and the TN two notifying the authorities of my demise. All the while my head was up and aware let me tell you. If Swinger had been along this would have never happened. Chatter, Chatter, a true bear deterrent. Closing in on the gap I get a different kind of trail surprise…mother deer and her baby fawn, spots by the dozen on her little back. Ears pitched high listening. I keep moving my same pace towards them and after a few gallops and stops, looks over their shoulders they determine I am harmless. Just a hiker passing thru. I followed my friendly girls for a half a mile.Buds and blooms, bees and wings, fill Symms Gap. Bonnie would have been under growth, flowers and grass up to my waste and more. Tick haven. Using my sticks to push away the foliage I see my destination.Wonderful camp spot on this crest between openings of the field. Has tree coverage for protection west and views east. Just before settling in for my lunch I take a quick trip to the woods and find remnants of those just camped here. It had to be the boys I meet a mile or so back. Beat Box Boys I called them. Tunes blaring as they hiked south to the shelter. Instead of hiking out their can goods they left them covered with a flat rock. DUH. That’s why that bear will be visiting here. Don’t worry boys I’ll pack it out and plan to give you a notice when I see you later. A nice breeze keeps the bugs away and me cooled off while eating my lunch. Feet feeling fine and aired out after a 7.7 mile walk in. I’ve always wanted to camp here and hopefully one day I will. Having to get back for TJ’s birthday party I don’t tarry long and get back to hiking.Just leaving the TN two come in sight. They ran into all my surprises too. B-day girl had her first bear sighting and was thrilled. They followed the little fawn too. Ya’ll be sure and have lunch here, I just did and it was great. Good luck in the whites they say as I disappear from them back into the woods.I looked for all my friends heading back but they have had enough of me I guess. Making quick time of it and I’m working on my new hiking stride which is shorten to alleviate a hard heal strike. My feet problems are still with me but they can be stymied if I take good care. Reach the Rice Fields I have pasted another section hiker from Toledo Ohio. He has done the whites and tells to me take it for real, shelter to shelter. I see he is packed heavy and booted. Hope that was what hindered his mileage and not all the terrain. I see the boys have just rolled in for their days stop and introduce myself to 2 other hikers resting. One from Massachutes and the other New York. Not in any hurry in the heat, having only come 7 miles they hope to cross the ridge for a stealth camp at their leisure. They are impressed with my mileage totals along the trail and wish me luck too. As I to them. For you other fellas, PACK IT IN, PACK IT OUT!Cruising back to my car I am feeling fortified with the treats of the day. I couldn’t stand another surprise. Oh but I get another, Looking down on my car from the trail I see I have a flat tire. Well Damn. The surprises just keep coming my way.","Clendening Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544316,"We've planned a whole year for this.   Made reservations, redone and refunded some(oh how I will miss Anna), worked out and got worked up. Time now to travel. Larry shuttled us from the Christiansburg park-ride down to Roanoke to catch the first AM bus to Lynchburg. Amtrak will take over from there. This will be our first visit to Boston's port. Our 12+ hour ride was uneventful bringing us in after dark and needing to get to the rental car place. Reading signage for where to go from here was sketchy to say the least. Scrambling around like chicks out of their pen we look for advice from workers who were locked behind various glass areas. ""Hey how's this machine work to get a voucher to ride a shuttle bus? We pulled credit cards and cash out trying all methods of payment to get past go. Finally a piece of paper popped out and we darted for the turn styles. Bump bump. Mine won't turn. Jump it Lead dog. This dawg don't jump! Oh yea put the paper slip in here. Ta Daaaa. Open sesame. Short buses packed with us and others motor under ground with speed limits of 35 which seemed high since one wrong maneuver would clogged the whole road and kill us all. To keep my mind for this I talked to my seat friends. Folks asked about our packs and destination curious about the trail. Enterprise. That's us. Lines formed at various other car rental stands. All not with a reservation pls step as side. ""There are no other rentals left"". Wew glad we reserved. Do you want a white or grey van mamme.Jimbo takes the wheel, TJ second cockpit seat and I take the rear. Everyone knows women drivers in a city is a nightmare!   Darting with traffic the race is on. Quick exits and fast speeds made this exciting to say the least. 3 hours later we pull into the trailhead parking lot, Gorham NH. The Presidential's looming around us in the dark awaiting us to climb their peaks. Positions everyone. Nighty night. Jim takes to his cowboy camping, sleeping under the stars on the ground just behind the van. TJ takes the back seat and I take the floor. Not the best but not the worst.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544610,"Trucks rolled by all night along this stretch of US 2. Who would have known? Trail crosses the road and then this parking lot is just down the way from Marie’s place, the White Mountains Hostel. Oh if we could have stayed with her. But our late night travel prohibited us from entering and disturbing other so our VanLife was the alternative. TJ and I fogged up the windows LOL while Jim rolled around in the sand of the parking lot. Unfortunately for him cowboy camping prevented any shelter from the northern lights. Damn sun comes up at 4:15 up here. Full on day light hits by 5 making for a very short night’s sleep with us bedding down close to midnight. First things first is getting breakfast and taking our wheels back to the Enterprise in town. Marie recommended a local café, Welsh's, for breakfast and it hit the spot. True hiker stop too with big plates of food. We filled our bellies and our water bottles for the day. Things began to get interesting once we pulled into the rental car place. No one working. A worker from the adjacent car lot addressed us and said ""they never come in on time"". Making a phone call to get this show on the road we discover 'someone' will be in later today.....uhhhh not good enough. We need help now! So about 45 minutes later we have a guy roll in to basically say he'd take us back to the trailhead and check over the van after. Marni greeted us in her driveway as we pulled out our packs from the van and readied ourselves for what we came here to do. She offered us a slack pack to start off but we already have our game plan so we'll go with it.   Looking back I 'd take a slack any day offered up there! Closing in on mid morning we finally step into the woods and right in the middle of a young hiking groups journey. A gal leads is leading them into Rattle River Shelter about 2 miles. She is a previous thru hiker sharing her love for the trail with these little ones. We were asked to tell them about our adventure and explain what a section hiker is. What a perfect place to hole class.Time to get our climb on. We hear Mt Moriah has a grand 360 view of the presidential range and are anxious to see it. Rocks roots and more rock stumble our path. We only have scheduled 8 miles today and feel no need to worry. HummmmmFeeling travel lagged I step aside for Jim to lead our way. He's as jumpy as a cat and ready to sprint out of the gate like a colt at the Kentucky Derby. This pace will have me spent in no time so I try to settle into myself. It's warming to pretty hot day as well.Moriah is reach and there is a .1 side scramble to its top. Sure why not. We drop our packs and bring our lunch up. Now when I say scramble I mean it. No path just rock climbing to the point of uhhhh now I'm up here how am I gonna get down?Pat, a hiker, is up here too. He shares his local knowledge of the area and proves a nice tour guide. Part of me listens while the other part tries to nourish and hydrate. Madison, Washington, Monroe he points out. Wow we will be that far in 2 days. Now to get down from here. Turns out not as bad as I thought. 2 more miles and we will be at Imp shelter our destination for the night. Making fair time and feeling we could make it say another 4 miles we decide to press on to help shorten our day tomorrow (13). The stretch to Imp was a blur. Boardwalks between mountains, high grasses and closed in shrubs. Passing Imp this all changes to ROCK. Get you climbing gear on, put those sticks up and grab ahold. In front now I search for hand holds and places to use my strength, legs. Go Lead dog go Jim encourages. I don't stop till we cap out. This 1.25 mile of pure madness lasted for ever it seemed. Put us on top just at dusk. Finding a flat area, camp spot prime, we throw down on North Carter Mtn.Heaven. I have a perfect spot for my tent and the fellas have ample too but agree it a fine opportunity for cowboy camping. Roll out that bunk and sleep open under the stars. Starving we all dig in for supper. SlimJim is going stove-less this whole trip and me, I am for these first days since we have lodge meals coming next two nights. TJ cooks up a fine smelling dinner and has his coffee press close at hand. We watch the sun go down casting awesome rays of color around us and over the ridges. Feeling like we accomplished more than we intended felt good however in the back of our minds we know tougher is in store. Happily we meet up with Bones tomorrow. She plans to meet us at the Gondola on Wildcat Mtn. She has hiked this before and We hear this stretch of A-E cats are mean. Each peak has its own letter, interesting.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544669,"Early morning light stirs cowboy #1. Restless sleep has me wanting a few more winks but I know we have somewhat of a time deadline today...meeting Bones. First thought last night was 10am but that all changed after that last climb and realizing fast ain't part of this area. Jim is dead set on getting there by noon or sooner and if off. That's 9 miles away and oh about 6 now. Seems doable in our 'normal' world but hey this ain't home anymore. TJ and I saddle up walking with the morning sun.This nice ridge walk again presents us with bog boards and tight tree line along side the trail. Not our typical ridges like home with easy sailing on good flat trail. Oh I can wish can't I? Middle Carter past and South Carter. Oh goody now we get to rock climb again. Mt Hight. Straight the hell up. Push off those sticks to get that leg high enough to make the next level. Damn this is hard. My pack is somewhat light but I'm wishing again for less. The openness of the summits is a breath of fresh air literally. Unseasonably hot and humid and the air is thick. Reaching these revives me. TJ follows patently while I pick my course down the next set of rocks. Carter Dome. Sheer rock face the blazes follow down with a nice layer of smaller rocks tumbled down it's edges. Trees have been used for hand holds as I reach for them as well. Oh and let's add a hint of dampness to make it interesting. Thank goodness it isn't raining. Our first hut is spotted. Green roofs and a pond. Seems a long way to reach them. Let's just jump to expedite!   Reaching the pond Jim's pack is here. No way....where's Jim? We decide to soak our feet in this inviting pool with the Lilly pads and burping frogs just about the time Jim emerges from a side trail. He has taken a visit to Carter Notch Hut. Bowl of peaches, coffee and tried to make contact with Bones. The huts offer food with your stay and then gives or sells for a nominal price the leftovers. TJs eyes light up with the talk of coffee and we follow suit while Jim dashes for the Wildcats. A nice young man greets us entering the hut. Sky lite room, wooden beams, and a large eating area with bench seats and tables. Free leftover pancakes, cranberry juice. Coffee and lemonade a $1. The Crew or Croo staff the huts working month long shifts or more helping with cooking, bedding and such for paying guests. Staying hut to hut would be quite the expense for us so we just targeted 2 paying stays. Each include family style breakfast and dinner total $170 per hiker. (Joe dodge lodge and the prime spot Lake Of the Clouds). Let's just stay on here TJ. They have all we need. Time to tackle this cats. 3 miles worth of rock step rock step, climb climb. An opening, more people coming our way. Are we close to the gondola? An opening and it appears. You can take a ride down for a fee to the bottom of Pinkham Notch and a snack bar. We don't see Jim or Bones so we make our way to a grassy spot to crack for lunch. Not sure what time we arrived but it was past my lunch hour. Other thru hikers gather around and we hear them talk of their struggles to get here as well. Good it's not just me. Hey anybody need a soda? Bless you, I run and kiss Bones shoes. Big orange soda and Jim has TJ a Powerade, Nice. People come and go up and down the Mtn while we eat and look out to tomorrow's big Mtn range. Madison and then Mt Washington. Daunting and exciting. Bones tells us what to expect over the next few mile off of here. She's climbed up it and been down it from last year. Ugggg i hate stupid steep down. Feels like you can topple over with any miss step. I tuck my sticks in my pack so I can use all fours and my arss. Butt scoots work good for this big girl.2 mile of this shit. My knees creak and my feet starting to feel bruised. I follow TJs tactical steps. Rock crevices with little room for error cut our path. Bones following a line Jim takes steps quick and whoops. Twirls around and takes a fall. Smiling on the way down. That's gonna leave a mark. Gathering herself up she takes the lead for a bit and slows the pace. Good I can keep up. An hour passes and then 2. We still are going down. I see the road just can't get to it. Finally the bottom hit our feet and we all are spent. Lodge supper is at 6 or so. We have time but would like to shower. Hum why not here? Crystal waters flow right beside the trail. It's hot, I'm hot, time to swim. I can't get my clothes off fast enough. Tiny pants is off for a high jump. Rock ledge lures him for a spectacular entrance. Me I just hobble in, sports bra and underroos, hello! Jim gets his nerve up to submerge and Bones tippy toes in to her knees. The quarter mile walk after seemed eternity but I made it. Exhausted and hungry. We hardly check in and see a snack table with fruit, veggies and dip. Iced water.. Oh yeah. Jim and TJ head straight for the dinner line dropping their packs in our room. I hit the showers and join them along with Bones. Salad, bread, soup, meatloaf, stuffed pasta shells, potatoes, dessert. We loaded up. Since we plan to leave extra early in the morning we will miss breakfast so I confer with the kitchen staff on a bagged lunch. They fix these up for us to pick up later.Lots to do in a short time. Eat, shower, pick up our shipped box of food for next section and prepare for our so called slack tomorrow. Topper (Maine chic we met at McAfee, remember Jeff trying to pick himself up another Bonnie?) will pick up our gear hear and drive it to the top of Mt Washington. Oh yeah. So all we plan to carry is our food for the day, rain jacket, toiletries and water/treatment. Time ticks and before we know it its way past hiker midnight.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545107,"Agghh another restless night. Tired, anxious and thoughts of pushing hard today have me wondering what I have gotten myself into. Madison's profile is 2.5 miles straight up. I can only imagine the trail or lack of.   Good side is we have 5 miles of, uh flat walking, to get to the base of it.Taking another hot shower to wake up is all I can do at this point. Our packs are light but my legs are heavy. Female time and lack of sleep have me slowed out of the gate. But I have the desire to grind it out and see what I can see from the top of this massive Mountain they call Washington. Jim and Bones light our way, 5ish. Wide path, cobbled rock, grading up. More up than Awols profile shows and has us pressing to walk faster to make better time on ' easier ground'. Rock hops between rooted spots and twisted trail make that a challenge. Reaching Osgood campsite, our 5 mile in mark, we are already hungry. Let's lighten the load and eat some of our packed out lunch. Heavy samiches. The kitchen staff did us well. TJ's, the size of a football, goes down quick. First lunch. Topping off our water its time to get my game face on. Dig girl dig. Looking up as far as I can see, rock scramble. Hot humid. Sweat beads and then runs down from all over. I try to keep a steady slow pace so that the only goal is to just keep moving forward or in this case upward. Short stops to catch my wind, dry my brow and sip some water. Glad I can push off my sticks, for now anyways. Then the sign appears, going above treeline, be prepared. Big boulders of rock separate us now from short squatty trees. We pick our way up and over, down and around the steepest of this climb. Will it ever end? Bones say I told ya so..Madison is no joke. Mile an hour hiking time at best. Winds blow white clouds of weather up and over the ridges as we crest out to more openness. Wow I can see forever. I can see Mt Washington. Its sooo close....if you call 6 miles close. Madison hut can be seen down a steep rocky path. These rocks much different than the boulders we just hiked. Trail lined with more rocks stacked by trail workers and rock cairns now show you the way. With no trees white blazes are on the cairns and can be spotted for quite aways in good conditions. Snow or fog would make this a guessing game. We've heard a storm chance by 3 this eve. Our intent is to meet Topper around 4. We first said 2 but realized that was too big of a bite.   Humid and hot those storms are looking like a very good chance. We can only hope to beat them out.Rolling into the hut we eat lunch and have some leftovers from their counter. Other hikers are here discussing their options too. People seem to be coming and going over these ridges with no concern of turning weather at this time. Feeling pushed to just get there we discuss our options. 'We have no option, our gear is going to be a Washington, we gotta go!"" Slim Jim announces. Bones has a reservation on standby at our present location and parleys to just settle here. Now that's a thought. But we have come up the hardest, chance of storms will happened every day this time of year. My vote is to continue just don't get so far apart from one another. Heat pounds down on us as we head out approaching Thunderstorm Junction. Clouds build and then break trying to gather for storms. Hang on hang on don't you do it. I ask for help from above to provide us safe passage. Keep us strong and give me stength. The trail side steps Mt Adam, Mt Jefferson and takes us over Clay. All of which are open climbs with plenty of rock under foot to hinder speed. But wow what views. Incredible heights to see from. Then it happens....A blanket of fog rolls in. We begin a steady climb over the next 2 miles approaching the summit. A summit that is now unseen. Jim and Bones are out of sight. I see TJ's orange Suns hat and his orange mat on his pack. I need energy I need food. TJ agrees and we take a quick break to refuel but can't stop long. Our sweat dries cold in this wind and we chill fast. A whistle blows, roars in the mist, earth shakes....Its the COG. The old train system that used to be the way to the top of Washington for the dignitaries years ago is still in operation for tourist and us alike. Shit wish I'd taken the train once again. Moon this and get a $500 fine. Many hikers have unclothed for this tradition but I just wave.    We cross the tracks and know we are very close to the summit.More wind, more fog, people....where did they come from....a quick glimpse of the observatory but disappears with the weather. High Top House! What's this? Where's the observatory? The summit? We step inside this building out of the winds and fog. I grab my map and TJ follows some people with coffee cups in hand discovering we are only steps from the other building. Parting the fog we reconnect with Bones and Jim who have already ordered a bowl of hot chowder. 4:00 tourist are everywhere and more come and go on the Cog. The auto road is a quick way to the top and our Sherpa, Topper, has driven hours to support us bringing not only our gear but some goodies to celebrate our accomplishment. Running on adrenaline I have some chowder also and of course an orange soda. We can't loaf around. Have a supper reservation at Lake of Clouds at 6:00. Must leave from here by 5:00 needing to hike one more mile or so. Trash bags of our gear are repackaged now on our backs. Damn this is heavy. With a few extra items for warmth my pack isn't as light as I'd like it. I run over to the post office window right in this building to mail my post cards so I can get a post mark from Mt Washington as a souvenir. TJ grabs a few more slices of pizza and Jim caps off his platypus with red wine for us tonight. It's Bastille Day you know?!Stepping out side it like walking into a hurricane. Wind whips us around, fog thick, pack covers holding on for dear life. Topper snaps our summit photo and we yell our thank you's and good byes. Rocks rocks rocks and more rocks. Wet now making for tedious walking but we hurry just the same. TJ stays in my sight and keeps close eyes on my progress behind him. Miss stepping I hyperextend my right knee. No time to mess around with this, shake it off and keep moving. Driving winds mixed now with rain, wonderful. Oh and let's throw in some pellets of hail. Now this is real Mt Washington weather. We have to be close to the hut. Can't see it. Then the lake appears between waves of fog. Rain has now picked up and the trail is a creek, we are good and wet now, perfect.Senses keen I smell the huts supper. We are here TJ find the door. Stepping inside was like a sauna but a good feeling. Supper has just started and we have been instructed to find our bunks and come on in for food. This hut holds 90 and is maxed out. More thru hikers come in and they have to wait till after supper to eat and can bunk in the dining area on the floor. Bunk rooms hold 8 and are tight quarters but ample provided with mattress, two wool blankets and a pillow. Dry clothes on it chow time. I slide in to an empty seat with a table of guest. Jim, TJ and Bones are scattered out too. Family style food is passed around and the Croo entertains us with stories from the mountain and some funny skits. The weather parts and our area brightens with even sweet light. Golden hues of the sun setting. We can view from the window lined room. Time to celebrate. I go to stand up and my knee buckles. Ut oh. Not good. Doctor! A quick assessment by Bones and she determines probably not a torn anything just a strain. Let's keep is straight so it doesn't tighten over night. Ace bandage applied and a cup o wine! All better. We watch the sunset, chat with others and pass the cup around. We've climbed the hardest section cheers to us. Quite hour begins at 9:30. Good by me I am tired. I crawl into my cubby hole, hang my wet clothes around in my little nook and quickly drop off to sleep.","Joe Doge Lodge-Pinkham Notch

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545247,"Soothing music floats into my ears. A song with laughter and tale. Our wake up call that breakfast is being served in 30 minutes. Oh man did I finally sleep good. My little cubby hole did me good. Now to get out of here and see how the knee is feeling. Jim assist to make sure nothing gives way. Bunks and ladders can difficult under normal conditions. Step one, step two, seems to hold but quite tender. We'll see when the pack goes on.Yum breakfast, seats everyone. All the thru-hiker have had to move their bed rolls out of the dining area and are piled up in the corner area and wait patiently after all paying guests have been fed before they can have their meals. Some move on with big plans for making miles while others try to gain a few more winks setting up.The Croo hands out oatmeal, bacon, dried fruits, pancakes, eggs, coffee and cranberry juice. All of which empties out quick. Chatting with my fellow hikers we tell of our plans and goals. The Croo informs us of the historical temps and winds recorded up here and the good news of today's forecast. 50's with 70's later today and wind gusts 30-40. Rain clearing and by the looks outside all is coming true. Clouds roll away and brighter skies come in. The lodge turns into a buzz of worker bees with hikers packing up and Croo members readying the facility for the next batch to arrive. Gathering our gear some is still pretty wet. Especially the shoes. I dressed in my wet clothes for breakfast so they could warm on my body. My shoes squish when put on. We have another 14 miles today and sure hope I can hold up. Reality is setting in, this shit is hard! “I knew it would be hard but didn’t think this hard”, SlimJim. There has been no resting time or easy spots along the trail. No breaks between hard and harder and we here more is to come.Wind jackets and rain jackets on for wind protection we are off to start our day. Views past and over the lodge are nice to see. I sure didn’t want to miss what this wonderful has to hold. Rock cairns lead us once again and will for the next several days with above treeline coming and going over vast mile sections. Summer flowers try to keep their blooms in this harsh environment and make me smile when I see them. Patches at time surrounded by rock rock rock. Our path leads down mostly and is a nice change but puts stress on my knee and this transitions to the hip. Medic. Some vitamin I and such puts me back on track and eventually out of the ace bandage. Temps warm and we shed layers. Stopping for pictures and visits with other groups of hikers. And there are many since we are now into the weekend, Friday. Jim shares his phone with a mom looking to contact her son. How’s that for a switch? We reach out to our loved ones too. Passing a few more named mountains, Mt Monroe, Mt Clinton/Pierce brings us closer to our lunch stop, at Mizpah Hut, which is right on the trail. Good damn thing or I would have come down this crazy steep side for anything. Mileage of .1 equals a hell of a lot longer than .1 Like the lady said “this is the longest .2 I’ve ever done!” Sun beats down on us but hey this breeze has helped and dried some things out. We stretch out any items damp on the rock beside the hut and shed the shoes to get some sun on the insoles to finish them off too.What a nice hut. They all are but this one seems to draw me. Nice deck area for lounging. It’s also nice to wash up in their bathrooms and reload water from the tap. Soup anyone? Jim of course. He hasn’t missed a soup lunch that I know of. TJ and I lighten our load and dig in our food sacks. But soon supplement with a cup of soup too. Bones has her cup of lemonade and checks our location and distance left for the day. Well we have hiked a mere 4.5 mile and that’s taken all morning. We have 9.5 to go but first we must climb down Webster cliffs. They are said tough like the Wildcats. Damn does this ever end? Just get me to some Bob Peoples trail please!Blessed with the beautiful weather I give thanks and move on. Bog walks between ridges and some nice view over Mt Jackson give me a boost. Our group pace is nice too. Bones leads us with me and then the boys telling jokes just behind. They can talk up a storm and giggle like school kids. Wow you guys need a room? Two hikers are wrapped up close on a bog bridge enjoying each other’s space. They are SOBOs and have another with them which we run into shortly after, the shoeless wonder. Yep the dude is hiking barefoot but only to give his feet time to dry he says. What the hell are you thinking man? These cliffs are gonna shred those feet. Mt Webster provides a nice place for a snack and rest. Wind still gusts making getting too close to the edge a little sketchy. Side trails add more hikers to our resting spot too. One gal has her puppy dog that just loved getting some special attention from TJ who is missing his Maria girl. Evening is drawing in and we still have miles to go but first let’s get off these cliffs safely. Our shoeless friend is soon caught. We can’t wait on this all day and finally get a spot for passing and proceed tediously down the way. US 302 can be seen from above and the Saco River. Crawford Notch. It’s a long way down. Time ticks. My legs grow weary. Stupid step trail.Finally back in the woods and approaching some side trails Jim and Bones look over their Gut hook apps. They have been using their phones for navigation thru GPS and has helped greatly with quick reference on location and surrounding land marks. It doesn’t however give camping spot but does have notes from others who post what they have discovered along the way. Let’s stop before Ethan Pond Shelter. We can’t make that by night fall and I don’t wanna come in at 9:00. Bones agrees. Jim thinks we could find camp spot some place along the road between 302 and the river. TJ goes on out to scout stealthing on up ahead. Passing one last water source, Jim spots a place that could work. We drop packs and look for flat tenting while Jim seeing if anything else might work down the way. I have my tent just about set when he returns and so do the others when he realizes there is a dead fall tree right above us. Shit. Didn’t see it. So we all move farther back and in less than prime tenting spots. Tired, hungry, and tired I reset my tent and get changed for the night. We gather a few twigs for a small fire. Jim has fixings for s’mores! Good man!","Mt Washington
",Stealth Camp shy of Crawford Notch,"Jul 15, Fri",10.90
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545366,"I hear Jim get up predawn to set out on his marathon hike today. Having done is BIG mile training hikes he wants to give it a go here in NH. Bones plans to leave us today at Zealand Hut. She will take a side trail called Zealand Cliffs and meet her taxi ride at a parking. Then tomorrow she’ll hike into Lonesome Lake Hut on down the trail and Jim is to meet her there. His trek will take him over more tough trail and Franconia Ridge some 27-30 miles. We hope he makes it safely.Our morning begins steamy with fog burning off to another hot day. We break camp and talk is already turned to ‘let’s just come off at the road and get that shower” I try not to listen. My body is telling me “oh yeah do it, do it” but my heart is set on completing what we set out to do. TJ is stuck between the devil and me. Yes Bones you are little devil setting on my shoulder enticing me, come with me, come with me Martha, to this place off the trail where you can rest and recover. Reaching the road Bones contacts her boyfriend to let him know how she is and to line up her taxi for today. She has a satellite phone that can reach out from anywhere. Pretty cool stuff. TJ and I converse. It’s decision time. I get a straight talking to from Tiny Pants who is wearing the Big Pants now trying to get Miss Martha motivated to get down to business. I know it just needed a kick in the arss. Pack straps pulled tight I start hiking up this next hill, head down, gutting it out. Reaching the Ethan Pond Campsites and Shelter, where we were supposed to hiked to yesterday, we meet more hikers heading north. They are pumped to be closing in on Mt Washington and give us some good news. The trail will flatten out for us. WHAT? No way. Thank God I didn’t bail. Ah this is a blessing. Four and half miles of flatness. Some bog bridges but good footing. Still in the rear I can push myself to walk a little faster with Bones and TJ leading our way. This is a lovely section with pines and hardwood trees. Trail passes close to a nice stream too, aka creek we’d call it. Crossing one of the higher bridges I come off the far side steps and just miss a step and wipe out. Busting my ass big time, that’s gonna leave a mark. Just tired I guess and lost concentration on what I was doing. A wide flat rock crushed path leads us to a boulder field but this time we don’t have to climb it. It is just beside the trail. Zealand Hut can be seen a few miles down the trail too. Cool we’ll be 8 miles in and actually making 2 miles an hour hiking. That’s a first on this trip.Wonder water falls flow by the hut. People are everywhere. Several short access trails are close by and the one Bones must take is here too. Oh I’ll miss her along our way. Wonder how Jim is doing?Treated to a bowl of potato and dill soup Bones provides a nice goodbye. She must hurry to make her taxi and looks like a spit of rain is coming. She has several miles to hike out and bolts. We’ll see ya down the trail girl…..Finishing my soup I look over our upcoming miles yet to hike today while TJ makes the last of his coffee for a fellow hiker. He’s happy to tip for the service and enjoys this fine brew from TJ’s press. Concerned about what’s in store for us I chat with other who have just come from our direction. They confirm it is up but not too crazy. Down to 2 of us now, which really has been sorta this way from the start. TJ has been right beside me or should I say literally behind me pushing me to succeed. He is my rock! The heck with these under foot! We decide we will hike to Bondcliffs and see how we are and hopefully can find a stealth spot to camp knowing we can possibly make it all the way to Garfield Ridge Shelter. That’s 10 miles from here and we’re on past noon.Trekking out TJ takes the lead and we head up the rocks. Steps which are manageable continue for a good mile and we crest in to woods and back out to rocks. Then the trail opens nicely to a field? Who…grasses and shrubs, looks like Ireland, with a path of rock leading to the Bondcliff Trail to Guyot Shelter. Not an option to stay, it is .8 off the trail. We continue back to rock hop. Tons of rocks lay in all sizes and shapes for a half a mile or more. You just have to trust your balance and step one to another. Sticks are just for slight touching cause if you rely on them and lean they will just slid from under you. This really stresses the feet and lower legs.Meeting more hikers by afternoon folks are jockeying for best places to hike to for the night. We ask those hiking South and we tell those hiking North. Hearing we have an option to stealth just prior to Galehead Hut we push for this. We can pop down to the shelter for water and come back to camp for the night…just look for a little path they say prior to the hut. Crossing South Twin mtn is our highlight of the day. We’ve come a great distance from the morning not only in body but in spirit. 14 miles walk. An internal mountain I climbed. Views are breath taking. We see Mt Garfield our obstacle tomorrow and Franconia Ridge. Wow this feels good. A deep cleft of intense rocks lead us down down to Galehead almost a mile in length. We pass some folks making their way to the hut for the night. Hope they make that 6:00 supper time! There are a few we know have no chance in doing so. Say what’s the reservation name in? I can be you! Smells of the kitchen hit us in the face…then I see it. A water bar cut and the path.. this is it TJ. We pop off the trail and follow this deer path back in thick under growth and mosses. Damp. I see a tent. TJ asks if they mind company and we look around for good tent spots. This will be my last night with my tent. I plan to ship it home come tomorrow so let’s enjoy it.We get our tents up to secure our spots and then head for the hut for water. You can just stay at the huts without reservations unless you are a thru-hiker and work for stay. I’m sure they’d find exception for a section hiker but work would still be required. And you already know how that works from my description from Lake of Clouds. Late to bed and early to rise.Tables are full of people eating. We peep in and spot the water and proceed to walk in like we know what we are doing. Man it smells good. I can’t wait to get back to camp and heat my hot meal. Yes I am finally really hungry and want to eat. Told ya I felt good. Cooking up our supper, the sun begins to set casting a night orange hue to our abode. More hikers come in to set up in this little piece of paradise. I pour the last of my trail beverage so TJ can share with me. I must have calculated wrong and seem to have an extra day’s worth in my bottle. Another pleasure I plan to end at the next town stop tomorrow. It’s my way of going ultra light. LOLAs the last sip goes down and almost the last of our daylight we give ourselves a pat on the back for making it to this location. Only lacking those same 3ish miles we left short yesterday. We’ll hit town tomorrow, the Notch Hostel awaits. We wonder how ol SlimJim is. What ridge he is on or rock he is under. No cell service to find out so we’ll just get back up and hike to find out.","Stealth Camp shy of Crawford Notch

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545422,"Rain peppers down on my tent waking me a few times in the night. Hope that spot I patched holds. I feel around my mat to make sure all is dry. Too tired to really come awake and or care I fall back to sleep. Waking to a slight shower I check my phone for a weather forecast. Radar shows a window allowing us to pack up without rain. It didn't pour so things aren't too bad. Wet means weight. We had discussed having breakfast at Galehead to enjoys views but it will be totally fogged in. So we pack up and have a bite here. Rain is to move out but right now looks threatening so we put on rain jackets and pack covers. Covers means hex the rain away.A cooler day so that the jacket feels pretty good to start. We have a few miles of warm up walking before the shit will hit the fan again and we'll have to pump those legs to climb Mt. Garfield. The profile is a line straight up almost a mile worth. What's this? A waterfall right in the trail...uh not so nice. TJ picks his way starting up giving a good path of least resistance. Wet rocks mean danger danger Red Robin. Carefully we scramble up and over bigger and bigger rocks turning into boulders. Hope Jim navigated ok over this. Getting to the top only means we have to come right back down the same crap on the other side. Really, who thought this was the best place for a trail? TJ seems to enjoy this and makes light of the situation. What a fe more rocks. AhhhhMore Presidents to summit today. Hikers warn of the false summits of Mt Lafayette. Oh do tell. Ridge line opens once again for another 5 miles of above treeline. Rolling jagged mountains for miles, 360 degree views all around. Hikers dot the rock lined path. Cairns lead our way. Franconia Ridge.Tiny Pants is feeling his finest and soon goes out of sight over the first false summit. Don't go. I settle into a pretty good pace and keep my legs pumping. My feet have already gone thru the sore phase, no blisters, just bruised like feeling. My heel pain has started to come into play which tightens up the left leg. All I can do is keep walking. Wind gusts, Clouds blow in and out casting shadows. Damp feeling but I'm still sweating and this mountain just keeps on climbing. Please Lord hold that rain for another day. Hikers are a plenty coming and going. Day hikers and thru hikers too. This one guy seems to ping pong with us. He catches up to me and then passes. Then he stops and I pass him. We both reach TJ who's stopped at a trail sign. Where's the top of this thing? Ace tells us a few more false summits and we'll have it bagged. He is in his 60s and has thruhiked before. Out on this trip doing 500 mile sections. Ace takes the rear spot and let's us head out to find the top. More and more hikers now. Some looking pretty fresh so side trails can't be far. Wind blows fog in and out but no storms. I keep my eyes on TJ orange hat. It pops over that last false summit. Finally the top. Photographers are set up and groups of kids are gathered around. Thru hikers look for that best photo and I offer to take some pics for those in need. Your mom is gonna like this one I say. Ace arrives and we catch a photo with him too. He has sorta fallen in with us and is nice to chat with and hear his stories. He isn't sure if he'll make it to US 3 which we say oh we'll be there. Got a room at the Nothch Hostel. Come with us.Having another 7 more miles we all know we have to get going. Still about 3 more and one last President to see. Mt Lincoln brings a nice break in the weather, sunshine. The threat of rain has left us and now we need water, drinking water that is. This whole ridge has been dry and we have Liberty Springs to look forward to. Not only water there but leaves us with only 3 miles left.Down to our last look out Ace confirms he plan to come on off at the road we can now see below, US 3. His car is parked there and I ask him if we can firm up a ride from him to the hostel. I bet they can fit you in for a room too. He agrees and makes our day. Now we don't have to worry with calling a taxi or shuttle for s ride. Ace is fast as any young hiker on the down. Feet hardly hit the ground with each step. TJ can't keep his pace. Glad we came to another sign junction so I could rest my feet. Three ladies are here who are camped just down the way. They are locals out for some fun and are impressed with our goal this trip and how far we've hiked all together. How do you guys hike in these rocks all the yime? It's killin me. Y'all check out my journal now. Skipping on down this cobbled path Ace is gone. Dang who's he do that.? Vitamin I is much needed but I don't want to take the time to stop. We are so close. Flume parking, keep going. White blazes keep following. Ace direct us to a cut off blue blazed path to his car, we are here....or are we? We walk and we walk...where is that dang car? TJ even is slacking back. This extra mile 13 mile day to another 14. Hobbling into the parking lot, Ace has his trunk open and pulling out refreshment. Wine anyone? Chips? I fall to the pavement and stretch out to cry mercy! Just put some rocks over me and call me done. Trail magic at its finest. Time for town. Jim has notified us he is already settled into a bar with Bones, the Woodstock Pub. They didn't go on to Loneseome Lake after all. The threat of rain had Bones calling off that section so Jim's had an early finish day and some rest. He has us some buds awaiting, nice.A shower, fresh clothes and that cold brew ahhh.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545470,"Zero means NO miles hiked today. Sleep in late if you can. Wash clothes. Hang up anything to air out including yourself. The Notch is nestled in the little town of North Woodstock. Touristy yet quant. Who knew waterslides would be popular in this little area. Franconia Ridge surrounds the area and of course our next mountain to climb, South Kinsman. The place is full of hikers and we had a room to ourselves last night with Ace joining us in our 5 bunkroom. Last night we couldn’t get showered quick enough to head out and meet Jim. Chugging beer and chocking down my first full meal, their biggest black and blue cheese burger. 10 ounces I think it was but I could only eat half and half of the fries. It was great. I ended up eating the rest for my breakfast today. I hung up my damp tent and Tyvek to make sure all was dry before readying it for shipment back home. TJ will be my bunk buddy if need be in his/my two man tent he and Anna usually share. He hasn’t set up but once electing to cowboy camp instead. Packs and shoes are to be left outside in a gear shed, good call. The house turn hostel is 3 stories with kitchen facilities on the 2nd floor. All communal along with showers and bathrooms on each level. Get up early for best water pressure! We plan to hit the grocery today while eating lunch out. Owners, Serena and Justin, are fantastic hosts providing laundry service, shuttles and amenities. The lined up a shuttle for a big group of us to hit town and will either come back to pick us up or we can call the Shuttle Connection. Top on the shopping list is food I’ll like better when exhausted. Salami, hard cheeses, triscuits will be my go to. I am mailing home most of the flavored tuna packs and cheese its. Also Jim needs to find a dress for the summiting of Moosilauke two days from now. Tradition is slack packers are to wear a dress but it has evolved to anyone can or I say should. The mountain, hiking north would be the introduction to the Whites so for us will be our exit. YEAHHH We’ll flip up our skirt-tails. Food is all we can think about so we head for a pizza joint. Calzone sounds good and a Greek salad. They wrap up my leftovers so I can eat later. Jim finds his little black dress at the dollar store and TJ buys some more dress socks. His new shoes have treated him well and using thin socks has worked much better than other thicker socks. Meeting back at the grocery store we run into a whole new group of SOBO’s. Who knew that some of this group would fall in with us for a few more days? One fellow in particular, Peaches, has clicked with us. He started hiking south June 2nd. Reminds us of Ridge Rambler from last year.Once back at the hostel we kick back on the porch, drink a few cold ones and listen to the music. Justin has a loaner guitar waiting for strumming and TJ is just the man to do it. The fellas harmonize and kick out the tunes for several hours. They play up a storm, literally. A cloud bust and dumps the rain down. Almost 6:00 and a couple more hikers come in that have slackpacked Kinsman, just like we plan to tomorrow. Curious about what is in store I have to talk to one of them. Coffee looks whipped out. Of course he got soaked on his last few hours which always makes a hike tough. He is a northbounder and says hard as hell. Holy crap I dread this now. Says bogs are under water, terrible trail, terrible rocks. All I can vision is another Garfield and wading up to my waste in the bogs. At least I won’t have a big pack on my back. I have already selected one of the loaner day packs from the shed for my day. I will only carry a light jacket, food, water treatment and toiletries. No medical stuff, no survival stuff, I’m winging it.Taking some me time I head to the room to sort my gear. My resupply box has more than I need or what I want so will turn some of it right around and ship back home, Tent goes in, long sleeve shirt and socks. I grabbed some of the power gel blocks from the ‘free hiker box’ downstairs to add in replacement. Will try these for extra boost when I can seem to eat anything else. The ones Larry got me for xmas gifts have worked pretty well.   Gummy bears are a necessity now too. They provide sugar kick and taste fruity which I like. All sorted and ready for tomorrow I do feel much better having this zero day. I’ve been keep my legs loose by climbing our steps to our bunkroom on the 3rd floor. Funny I know. You should see the “kids” walking down the step like me. Holding on to the hand rails easing down to each step taking the pressure of the knees. By tonight that has subsided for me thank goodness. But I still can’t squat. Realized that when I went to settle in on the toilet. Just fall the rest of the way down and hope the rim catches me. I’ve been half squatting in the woods so the test was in town. I might have to plan these zeros a little closer together from now on.","Franconia Notch, The Notch Hostel

We'll see ya again next year when we come back for Maine. But For now let's get to slackin.Serena pulls the big truck up front for the first load to shuttle. Some are slack packing like us and some are carrying their full load and hiking on north. Echo is a gal we got acquainted with last eve. She and her group have full packs. Jim jumps in behind them aiming to keep their pace. Heading up right out of the gate has me feeling pretty good. I can tell I've had a day off. Legs fell strong again and not carry a big pack agrees with me. I am sure TJ could have kept up with the others but hangs back with me letting me lead the way today.This area is much like home. Lush and great and less rocks yeah!!! Dust under foot is nice.   We make great time. Hearing some of the second group closing in on us we pull over and let them pass. Peaches and another are moving fast. Their first time slackin and loving it. See ya back at the hostel he says. We have till 6:00 to call in for a free shuttle from the hostel. After that we will have to us the town service. I'd like to say we can make this but who knows. 16.3 miles is still a lot to do. This cooler day is nice. A few times I actually got cold when the wind picked up and patches of fog rolled in. Having a few quick stops for snacks kept us fueling a moving. Before we know it we have hiked a little over 7 miles. Let's get over Kinsman and have lunch at that next shelter. Their are 2 summits of this mountain and a pond half way up at like 3500 feet elevation, weird. Say maybe we'll see a moose! Thank you trail workers, you have done some great work on this path.Do I hear Jim's voice behind me? TJ ponders the thought. We have passed them, how? They stopped a Eliza Brook Shelter for lunch. Hey Lead dog you are doing good today as he approaches still running with Echo and her gang. Yep I have found my rhythm. Cross the brook we are lead into an open are and view of the pond. Pretty. A long stretch of bog boards are next. These should be under water like Coffee told us. Stay left TJ instructs having taking our lead. His weight and the boards are under water. You can bet I'll be under for sure. Tapping my sticks in front of each step I make sure there is a board under foot. Missing could mean in up to my waste. Here Mr. moose, come out from where ever you are. Cresting Kinsman we have no real views. What? 4300 feet and just tall weathered like fur trees. This south summit wasn't too bad let's hope the North is good to us too.Rolling ups and downs along the summit line and still good trail. Coffee is crazy. I guess the rain made his trip worse for him and that's why his description of this section was harsh. That or he is just a P-------Steps up and over North Kinsman and we are set to come off of here. Good I'm starving.   Just as we come down we get that one part in the trees and a perfect photo is handed to me. TJ fits in the forest cut like he was meant to be there. Franconia ridge surrounds us. Clouds shadow them. Wow breath taking.Kinsman pond shelter next stop. More voices and I smell fire. Much cooler now. Dampness sets over like it could rain. Taking the side trail more voices. It's a hen party. It's the women's spike crew, trail maintainers. They have been out for a couple of days using this shelter as home base. Undergarments hang all over the place, Victoria's Secret. TJ asks if he can come in. Man on sight ladies is every decent?I crawl up inside the shelter for warmth. I know I will chill quick and only have my wind jacket. All the girls are in jackets, pants and wool hats. We eat and chat up a storm. One lady has a son going to Virginia Tech and works at Cabo fish taco. Her family comes in for football games sometimes too. They tell us about their work and we thank them for work we just walked over. They are impressed by our accomplishments thus far and wish us well. Ladies I'd love to stay with you but we have miles to go, 5 more actually. Average steep down takes us to Lonesome Lake Hut. Now this is a hut I'd like to hike back into. About 3 miles by way of the AT in or couple miles in by side trail. Set right beside a wonderful lake. Bet you could see moose here every night. I'd love to take my shoes off and rest me feet in the water but gotta roll. TJ is setting a good pace to put us finishing in time to call for our ride. Closing in on the highway we hear the traffic. US 3 and 93. We go from blazes to highway looking for signal to make our call. Serena wants to pick us up at a parking lot... Hush how about right here from 93? My foot is shot. I make a call to the shuttle connection and he's on his way. $20 later and we are dropped off.Another big day done. High five. Let's eat.Chinese is ordered and a cold beer goes down while my feet go up. A new group of hikers have arrived. One young 17 year old, Blackhole, eats with us. He is averaging 20+ miles a day and is looking forward to seeing The Whites. B-hiker is too. She is older like me and very concerned of what is ahead asking lots of questions. She writes a journal too. Ace has moved on his way and we have a new bunk mate. He did a slack today too and eats with us.   Our time here will come to an end tomorrow. Will be time to strap on the pack and head for Hanover and cross the state line into Vermont. Thank you Kinsman for giving a boost today. Glad I slacked you.","NH 112 Beaver Brook

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545807,"Shuttle time again. Loading up headed back for the Notch. There’s so many notches hard to keep up with them all but at last we are leaving these after today. Mt Moosilauke is on our radar and is the last big mountain over 4500 heading south till your reach our state’s Crestnut Knob. That’s in Tazewell County, overlooking Burkes Garden. We are sporting our dress and looking fine today. Serena is snapping photos for her collection and a reminder of us passing thru their establishment. Thanks for all.Peaches and some of this group are packed up with us too and he has decided to pull a big mileage day with us. Well he won’t exactly hike with us. He’ll be faster in places and we’ll be faster in others but he plans to head for Ore Hill too. His pack is pretty big and loaded with more food than most of my gear weighs. Incredible.Our day starts off bright and sunny and not as humid. The trail goes straight up alongside a waterfall and is just gorgeous. Spray mists over us, very nice. I’m sooo glad this is looking again more like “normal” trail. It’s a work out don’t get me wrong but no rock scrambles. Three and a half miles of climbing is tough but we are making great work of it. TJ checks on my progress every now and again keeping me in his sights. I can usually hear them talking if they round a corner before I do. Jim’s voice booms with any sort of coverage so he’s always easy to track. Cresting Mt. Blue and little swag gives us a break in the climbing. Beautiful green under growth along the trail. Lush and clean. The trail turns to rocks but like the rocks walking over Grayson Highlands, gravel road bed like. The guys break out into the open, dresses flapping in the wind. Hold on to your hat girl. Heavier gusts have me putting my head down to cut thru the pressure. What grass that is up here is laid over. Rock bunkers are dug out for places to protect you from the wind and low and behold two heads pop out from one. Wonder how long they been in there?A big orange sign points out the summit, 4802 feet, Mt Moosilauke!! We don’t stand around long, to wind and cold. The air up our skirts gets us moving fast. Just off the top the trail become a little more protected in a tunnel of shortened trees and shrubs. More hikers come and go and one tells us a moose is up ahead, be careful. Jim and TJ are a bit in front of me and spot it first. I see TJ had dropped his pack to run and get a better photo. By the time I arrive Jim is quite close and I get some shots too. She is a your cow and quite disturbed by us all. She is twix and tween all the foot traffic and has no place to hide really. This tunnel has her trapped and us too. Using our farm instincts we treat her like a regular cow and try to herd her on down the trail to a wide area she can pull off too. Wooo girl she about turns and give Jim a false rush backing him into the shrubs, sticks in hex mode. She then takes a look to me. I holler back girl back, clicking me sticks to make noise. We make it past her while she barrels back up the trail at TJ and Peaches, who has caught up to us.Hoping they make it past shortly Jim and I wait on down the trail at a sign junction for the carriage road. It has become overcast now and with the wind quite chilly. Waiting almost 30 minutes we decide the boys have been captured by Maggie Moose or they have corralled her. Let’s get moving and hopefully they will be along. The down begins now with more of the rock scrambled steps back in place. It’s not stupid step thank goodness but again goes on for three and half miles. Part way down I hear the laughter from them fellas. TJ is almost in tears. He has shed his dress. What happened? A moose is still loose! Some guy tried to rescue them and only caused havoc. He tried throwing a rock, like a girl by the way, then the Berries tried to cut around the moose thru the bushes and got hung up. TJ jumped out of his dress so he could run if need be and surely didn’t want to be caught trampled to death looking too lady like. Peaches said it was a good thing they got out of there of that guy would have killed them all. Finally down to the bottom of this mountain we run into a little piece of heaven, a pasture, open field. Yes bottom land. Farms, People, road, town. This is the first field a southbounder will come across since starting at Katahdin. We’ve only been hiking a little over a week and I’m damn sure happy to see it I know they will be. We drop out packs and have our lunch. The Berries come by, they are so happy to see this. Trail name Strawberry and Blueberry, they are SOBOS and last name is Berry. They have a package waiting on them at the next town, Glencliff which is just a mile away. Peaches has headed that way too. We hear there is a new hostel, Hikers Welcome Hostel, .2 up that road, Jim’s read about it on his Gutthooks. Soda, ice cream, we are in.Eating my new food bought in Woodstock I’m feeling better about my lunch. It’s super hot in the field but to set down and not feel like I’m gonna pass out it feels good. Salami, hard cheese and triscuits. Washed down with Gatorade. Ahhh. We walk on down after lunch and stow our packs up in the woods and head down the road for the hostel. Some hikers are setting out front under the umbrellas. Peaches! Pretty Boy and Scruffy. Pretty boy is another young kid, has blonde hair, blue eyes yes he is pretty. His mom hiked Maine with him and now he’s off on his own for Georgia. He and Scruffy plan to stay here for the night but Peaches has his sodas and moves on. You guys coming? 8 more miles ahhh. I’m feeling the 9 we’ve done already. Mount Mist looks like only big obstacle. Putting our packs back on Jim realized he has left his water bottle back on the picnic tables. He goes back while TJ and I head on out. Good trail, steady as she goes. It’s just about one foot in front of the other. TJ moves on to tackle Mt Mist. With us all meeting at her top for a break and little snack. 5 more miles to go. My feet are starting to ache now. Heel pain is at its max now. 2 more miles to go. This day is going on forever. I try to quick step it but the arch pulling just won’t let me. Feet don’t fail me now. TJ worked up a blister or two. We are getting some better trail so we are walking faster even though I don’t feel like I am. Hopefully his feet won’t get in bad shape too. Darkness is falling and I’d sure like to see that sign for camp. Jim and TJ are out of my sights. They can’t be too far, still sorta hear them. My mind wonders what if I had to stop. I have no tent. Remember I shipped it home. I know I could wrap up in my emergency blanket. Yeah just lay down right here. Then I hear Jim. “We’re here” Orange sign says so, Campsite and Privy. Jim asks us to raise our sticks in celebration. Click, Click, Click, Go team Renegade, Rebel and Rogue. Peaches is waiting on us. It’s almost dark and there he sets on a log by the main fire ring area. There is no shelter here only camp spots. The privy is the only building and by the way an option for sleeping I run thru my mind. Again I have no tent and too tired to mess with one. TJ offers to set his up for me. He and Jim have already mentioned cowboying again so this ol gal is gonna give it a try. Several tents are up and everyone is already in bed so we try to be fairly quiet. I grumble under my breath at how hard the end of today was for me. And we’ll turn around and try to do a 19er tomorrow. Oh hell no. Peaches asks if that really is our plan. Oh yea it’s on that damn schedule so it is so. Well we’ll see. Getting in to my bag I look up at the stars. They are nice but what is that buzzing in my ears? Mice run about our area like a race track. TJ has already swatted at 2 and Jim has one rustling around his place. Oh man do I wish I was in a tent! Head net is close by and my jacket in case I get cold. Buzz Buzz. Head phones please. But what if a mouse eats on my stuff while I am deaf to it? Oh I don’t know if this is such a good idea…..","NH 112, Kinsman Notch

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545855,"Sleepless night. No not again. Hikers stir to get an early start. I know I need to as well but will wait for my fellows to stir. I go check out the privy and find it was in fact a good place to sleep. You laugh. There was a throne for the throne. I could have been Queen of this castle. Large floor area, cover and vented. The 'shelter' log is in here along with candles and a few fresheners, what?Packed up and ready I eat my breakfast while the guys get moving. Jim discovers an ear bud laying by stuff. Hey a mouse must have eaten someone's head phones. Little did he know that it was his. He said he felt them running around him last night. TJ slept pretty sound. He does love this cowboy camping. It will most likely be my last. Peaches hollers out, y'all still doing that 19 miles. Hell yeah I reply back. Get your sorry ass out of the hammock and let's go. Raising a laugh gets my mood on a better side. I honestly don't want to to 19 but will walk till I can't or dark falls first. We have the ice cream mans place to look forward to at the end of the day so let's get to it.Getting a jump on my guys I hope to keep a good pace today with some breaks between the climbs to help. Sunshine bring s smile to my face. Get it girl. A couple miles down and the guys haven't blown past me yet.   Ah but I hear them. Chatty Cathie's. Where's that Peaches?Mt Cube approaches. A hot climb it is but has some home like features making progression tolerable. I think I can I think I can. Keep on climbing. How far to the top? I ask some hikers coming my way. North Mt Cube side trail. Just a bit farther and I crest South Mt Cube. Thank God. Lunch. The guys are eating along with some NOBOs. Young gals with pretty big packs. A few day hikers are around too. A wonderful sunny day. I do wish I could lay back here and sleep, get a tan, sleep. Ah but we have miles to go before we sleep.TJ takes his time packing up and plays with sweat bees while I gather up too. He is always connecting with nature. Come on Martha let's go catch Jim. More good trail off Mt Cube and a few ups and downs to keep us honest. Rock ledges in and out of the woods with peeks out. The trail crews try to provide us views. We can see the fire tower we have to hike to. That's up there. Time to eat again. It's every 2 hours and the hunger hits. We need it to get up Smart's Mountain. Love the grade. Long and steady. 3 miles again of up. Winding around the mountain where's the top? Jim has left his stick to mark he is around. Peaches! Where did you come from? He is eating another meal and we snack too. The cabin would be a nice camp area. Fairly enclosed by trees and peaceful. The tower is just on past and has some tent spot. A big group is hanging out here. Then the trail gives us some stupid steep again. I head on out in front again. To get a jump start on my guys. There are a few side trails here and few white blazes. Have I taken the wrong turn? Steep ass rock slabs. No steps. Shit. I grab trees for help. I look over my shoulder for blazes, the guys. Trust your gut. You took the right path. You saw a blaze when you made the turn down. What? Rebar steps. Thank goodness for them. Then wooden step pounded into and on a solid rock face. Oh and it is straight down. This would be impossible to hike in either direction. The guys catch me here. Good We are together again. They have been grousing about this part too.When we meet a family coming this way closer to the bottom I wonder how the heck they will make it to that cabin. Fully loaded for a weekend hope they did. More NOBOs come through and we ask about camping at the ice cream man’s yard. They say yes and we say yeah. This will be out stop this eve. Will cut our day shy of 19 by a mile and a tad and I am glad.Stepping closer to a little community I have camp on my mind. That tent will go up tonight baby. Hope there is room for us. I'm sure the place will have hikers coming from south to us. Field walk comes into play. High grass to my waste. I have to use my sticks to part the grass to see the trail. Then the sign for Bill Ackerly's set in a mowed area, turn here. Jim has made himself at home, grabbing the last few sodas for us and directs us to ice cream. Lounge chairs on the back porch,deck area call me. I plop my tired arss down and enjoy the cold ice cream. Cheers to here!Several guys are tenting too. Pie, a gal who looks like a born hiker is camping on the front porch. She has hiked the PCT and is moving fast on this trail averaging 20s easily and more. Another hiker whom I recognize remembers me too. We met in the smokies a few years back. I shared my liquor with him then. Sorry Nib no beverages now I'm traveling light. Peaches rolls in and grabs himself a spot in the grass along with TJ and Jim. Cowboy up.A wonderful sunset falls over us. Pink skies, bird houses, croquet court, mowed off field. My tent will rest perfectly here. TJ assists with set up. Here Martha, your home awaits. I crawl inside just as the sun finishes.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545868,"Waking to the song birds this morning was so much better than buzzing in my ears. I didn’t turn over once last night I don’t think. Best night’s sleep since Lake of the Clouds and one better than that. Heavy dew has fallen bet the guys will be soaked. I tap the tent to knock off what I can before rolling it up. Thank you TJ for carrying this.An overcast day comes over and there is a threat of rain. We will have 18 miles again to reach town. It is what it is. Town day is reason to keep the wheels turning. There are a few big climbs too, one being Moose Mountain. Maybe we’ll see another!Pie is ready to hit her first BIG mountain since VA. Remember I told ya Moosilauke vs Chestnut Knob? She wants to top it today and has Jimmy’s little black dress to do it up right. He has passed it along to move on up the trail. She is so thrilled to have it too. Jim gets her contact info to follow her. (and we do. She covered in one day what we did in two, 35 miles over Smarts Mtn and Moosilauke. Then we find out even later she had hiked all of CT in one day, 56 miles. Incredible!)Working up my courage to knock out another 18 mile day I med up and get to moving. You guys will catch me I am sure. Trapper John Shelter was supposed to have been our stop last night and glad we just stopped here. The hike up to the shelter isn’t all that bad now but at the end of a long day would have been yet another hill to climb. After topping this little hill the ledges come back into play. Trail comes in and out of rock outcroppings giving us views of towns below. Humidity creeps back in. It’s Friday and many hikers are coming in for the weekend. It is sorta nice to pass folks and chat about where we are going and where they are going. What’s next to look forward to. They of course ask where I am from when I speak. TN, GA? If you say Southwest Virginia, the take it as south West Virginia. No we are not from WV. Hokies, Virginia Tech. They relate.Moose Mountain is a likable place. Beautiful trees, good trail and lots of views out. Ridge line is not long but gives you a since of being on top and not enclosed in tight forest. Actually meanders easily within short undergrowth with a nice dirt path, YES! Since we cross Moosilauke you could tell a new trail crew maintained too, all the signs are a bright orange and have lots of details. Peaches and Jim have rolled onward while TJ remains pretty steadfast with me. Thanks dude. Let’s get that one last picture from Moose to celebrate crossing this last mountain before have to hike another 9 miles to town. Hearing cars always gives you a sense of being done. Or seeing a road from miles away. I’m almost there and it turns out you have to walk another 5 miles. Yep that happened. We all connect back up at Three Mile Road. Low lands and dry thank goodness. Bones and others that hiked this last year said it was a muddy mess. Nowhere for water to drain off. There’s just a bit of bog walk and roots but not bad at all. What’s this, Magic? A cooler full of lemonade, little cokes and grapes. Oh my tastes so good. Takes my mind off how bad my feet hurt. Hiker hobble has set in. Hard to get the wheels back pumping once I stop. Flat trail has me in the back of the pack, my guys are gone. No worries we’ll meet up again at the edge of town I am sure. They will wait on me. I check my map for what to expect over the next 3 miles. Looks like one more pull up Velvet Rocks and all down hill from there. Rain drops, shit not now. I look up and the skies still have some blue. Can’t be too bad a comin. I’ll keep moving and not put pack cover on. Up and up, around and around. What the hell? This isn’t on the map. At least I could see the tops of this crazy trail. So you want to make me go right down what you sent me up I say out loud to the woods. Dang you ATC. We could have walked right around this. Pine needles cover a steep down, rocks and roots hide underneath to trip ya. I can see where the guys have slid and made their marks to stop. Oh please Lord get to off of here. Winding down I finally pop out to an open area adjacent to a football field. Dartmouth College, Hanover is reached.College town traffic runs the streets. I turn onto the sidewalk following the white blazes still. Scan for my guys and find them right as I expected, packed dropped in front of the Co-Op inside shopping for food and drink. I follow suit. Stinky, sweaty, hobbled I wander the store for pasta salad and an orange soda. I wanted a cart full of beer but would have to carry that to Betsy’s. She is our trail angle that we have lined up to stay with. We check in with her and find out arrival time needs to be before 8pm. She says walk on thru town the 2 miles and we’ll come to her house in Norwhich. Ah we’ll get our slice of pizza and call for a ride and walk this tomorrow. We are spent.Hooking up with Peaches and the gang at Ramuntos Pizza is first up. Cold drafts and huge pizza hit the spot. Then we have to get our free PBR at the Salt Pub, it’s tradition. Hikers have been writing on the walls here for years. I’ll sign in tomorrow once I cross the state line. Come on guys we better get our taxi from the little old lady and get to Betsy’s before she cans us. A sweet 80 year old woman pulls into the local post office turn around. She is on “the list”. Betsy created a list of trail angles in the Hanover area for hiker to call for needed assistance around town. Some are listed for shuttles some for a place to say. Marilyn is listed for shuttles and don’t call too late she doesn’t drive after dark. “Please sign my hiker log, name, city and state” Her notebook is full. Say Miss Marilyn you gonna be around tomorrow, we might need a ride after our walk into town and some visits at the local restaurants. Betsy’s garage is full of hiker packs. Peaches, Griz and several more are here. She meets us at the door, shoes off, Lead Dog you are first in the shower, pick out your change into clothes here, drop dirties there, Boys outside. No one is allowed in the house dirty. Roger that!Cleaned up we are all ordered to the outside screened in porch. Gathering around a big table she and her husband Bill give us their intro of how they got into this “Giving Back”. Her son hiked and had some trouble and was helped by a friendly couple and she decided she wanted to do the same, long story short. Betsy puts out a cooler by her drive way with fresh baked bread and watermelon, opens up her home, all for no charge, just pay it forward she insists. Beat from a long day of hiking and town fun we are ready to crash. We make our bunks outside in the porch area. Good a cool out here and with these blow up mattress, really cushy. Glad we made it here for our much needed zero day we will have tomorrow.","Lyme Dorchester Rd, Bill Ackerlys Ice Cream Man

Tucked under this screened in porch provided a pleasant night’s sleep all while a light shower rolled past during the night. Another hiker joined us outside after coming in a little late. He got up in the early morning hours to shut us off from the house since clocks were going off like made on the hour. Now that this door is locked I’ll have to exit around the house to re-enter to use the bathroom. Sure hope the garage door is open, NOT. So luckily her back side door was and in I go. Betsy said she’d be up early to do her Saturday chores but no one is about yet. So I keep quiet and land on the couch after my shower. Our plan today is to pick up those missed blazes where we left off at the Salt Pub last eve. These will connect from Betsy’s house, which is in Norwich VT, back over the Connecticut River and the state line. This mile and a half will be a stroll with no pack. Then we’ll get a few supplies while in town, browse the shops and hit some bars for food and drink. Pretty Boy and Scruffy came in last night. They both walked some big miles too. Pretty Boy did like 26 I think and said the town walk just about did him in. They were still sleeping when we headed out for town. We left message for them and Peaches to catch us for drinks later. Two other hikers we met along the way decided to camp outside of town, Double Dip and Camp Shoes.A wonderful day for a walk. Out the door we go from Betsy’s down a long hill into the main drag of Norwich. Beautiful community of old houses and look the fair is in town. Carnival rides and vendors. Jim is already looking to hit this up for food and TJ is scouting for rides. We’ll hit this tonight they say. My dress is now my town outfit and suits me well with my crocs. Yep you must be a hiker. Folks drive by on the highway and wave as we approach crossing the big bridge over the Connecticut River. Concrete etched letters VT/NH along with a white blaze confirms our location. Another state complete, YeeHoo! Travelers honk while we pose for our pictures. We hit CVS and the local outfitter. Jim rolls on down to the Co-Op again for some grocery items while TJ enjoys his iced coffee and me a park bench. Peaches, Scruffy arrive and wait with us till Molly’s opens up. I picked this one since it’s Larry’s pet name for me, a name his dad used to call me. Clock sticks 11 and we hit the bar stools and don’t leave till like 2:00. First course jalapeno martini infused with honey lime. Refreshing. Second course, hot wings and a Long Trail Ale please. Third course, fried oyster po-boy with siracha aioli oh and another. The crowd changed beside us each hour as we made new friends and enjoyed the conversation. Our bartender was once a participant on one of the singing shows. She was bubbly and had a great personality. We tipped her well. One more stop at the Salt Pub, sign my name on their wall, Hey Marilyn can we get another ride?Nap time. I find a shady spot in the yard and throw down my mat. The guys hit the porch. An afternoon thunder boomer cuts our rest short. We gather in the house and begin looking over the deliver menus for what to order for supper. Our laundry has been done, thank you Betsy, and I get my pack somewhat in order for tomorrow’s hike out. Here’s one less thing I’ll be carrying. Let’s pass it around and share my friends. Scruffy, SlimJim, Tiny Pants and me that’s exactly 4 and that’s how many days’ worth of beverage there is to toast. Down the hatch!The deliver cars come and go. You should have seen the food going down. Pretty Boy and Peaches joined in on the order time. We had every short order driver come in the community. Who’s up for the fair? Jim and TJ are bound to go. Not this old gal. Her feet are going to use the rest. Scruffy agrees. Ya’ll enjoy and don’t get sick on those rides. Skies clear for a marvelous evening, fireworks are next. We can see from the house. Glad I didn’t walk back down that hill. Hope the guys don’t stay out too late. They’ll be tired come tomorrow if they do. Since the porch is now cleared from this morning, mattress would have to be spread out again I opt for the basement tonight. Scruffy says there is a tv too. So we go down to claim our spots before others come in. I get the fans going and put right on me. This small room will heat up quick if other arrive. Wall to wall mattresses make this a bouncy house room. I’m on mattress #2 farther from the steps up out of here.

Of course a flat mattress will get you going too. My bed went flat in the middle of the night so I just moved up on the couch downstairs. Don’t tell her, no sleeping on the couches. She is antsy to get the guys out of here and keeps asking when they plan to awake. Garage packing finally begins, those last showers taken, and we are about to finally head out. Scruffy and Pretty Boy say their goodbye to me and I get their contact info with hopes to sharing some trail magic with them when to pass thru VA. Peaches is heading out with us for Thistle Hill.

My pack does feel pretty good but food and water do weigh. I try to stretch my heel and arch, this left foot will just be an aggravation till I get home and rest. Turning into the woods and I am thankful again for a sunshiny day. The fog took some time to burn off this morning but now crisp summer is upon us. A wide trail leads up and over Mosby Hill and we meet local walkers and runners on their Sunday strolls. Some hikers come from Happy Hill Shelter and other farther from White River in West Hartford. They tell us of a fella there who offers magic. You can also go jump off a bridge. More on that later.Slim and Tiny move on along this morning. I bet they will stop at the shelter since Betsy said it was a real nice one. Arriving I see it is a tad off the trail and downhill I just have a rest eating a snack. Hey puppy where’s your master? A lady comes along and we visit till the guys come and she follows in behind us. She is most interested in our adventure and the trail having wondered if she could do it. You already are, just put on a pack now and pick your pleasure. One night, two, then a weekend and then more. That’s how we started. Good luck and happy trails.Moving along clicking off miles West Hartford is reached. Blazes turn me on paved road and cross under interstate 89. Railroad tracks and the White River. Quant little place with an old schoolhouse, barns and buildings. Jim and TJ are setting on the porch of a closed ice cream parlor. Rats we were looking forward to this. Hiker are congregated down at another home we here told about. Randy comes out to welcome us. Have a soda, beer, you guys want some eggs? I have just walked to heaven yes, yes I’ll take some eggs. I put my spam and taco sauce in with them and had my best lunch on the trail yet. Soda is fine today I’ll save those brews for the jumpers need courage for the bridge. Coffee for the boys while we set on his porch like it was our home. Packs are all over the yard but where are all the hikers?Yeeee Splash Laugh Applause Peaches, Moose, Griz, Double Dip, Camp Shoes, you name them they are here. One by one they all have jumped from the bridge into the river. There is even a marked spot on the bridge for the location to leap from. Come on Lead Dog, Jump!!!! Hell no, the big girl will video my guys. TJ is already located on the ledge awaiting his prompt. “If you were told to jump off a bridge would you jump?” and there he goes. Jim’s up next, umbrella in hand, come on Mary Poppins let’s see you fly. Ditching the brella he steps to his ready, pausing, uhmmmm, well…..times running out on this snap….Here I Gooooooo, splash. The crowd goes wild and the jumpers keep jumping. Ok guys time to get back to hiking now….Peaches you and the gang coming?   The lure of the water’s edge and cold brews coming forth have them relaxing and enjoying this spot too much to leave just yet. It’s only 5 miles to the shelter and they have the rest of the day, they’ll be along. This girl knows 5 miles will take oh about 2 ½ hours normal time.We do take our time getting ready to roll. Guys dry off and have another soda/coffee while I decide to hike on, they pass me…Crossing over the bridge I wave at the clan still encouraging me to jump and stay. See you guys at the shelter. I expect everyone before dark! Turning back into the woods the trail steadily works up the graded hills in and out of woods and fields. Hot as hector too. Man I could use that river now. A small figure, is that a person? A leprechaun, Looks like a jockey he is so small. An oriental man loaded down. He likes the size of my pack and asked if water at Happy Hill Shelter. No sir I think I was told it was dry. Later the guys talk to him too and discover he had some good advice for our days ahead..Slack the Hell out that mountain….Killington that is. After leaving him I walk into a field of tall grasses, which turns to berries and flowers, how awesome. Blackeye Susan’s, Cornflowers, Raspberries…Cresting a little knoll a bench, VT Relax and Enjoy! I think I will. Felling that sense of this is exactly where I want to be… that hasn’t come over me in a while out here. Wide open spaces, mountains reminding me of home. Vermont you are treating me well, thank you. Where are my guys? They should have passed me by now. Humm let’s beat them in today. More good, trail I am on my 2 mile an hour pace, good girl. Hikers come toward me and say the shelter is just up ahead. 13. 5 miles done and it’s not even supper time.Two gals are in the shelter and several hikers are tenting. Howdy ladies, it’s sure good to be here. Kentucky says right back at ya. I know this is gonna be a good night. Her draw is twangy like mine. Then another speaks. Woo, I say you ain’t from around here are ya? Anna is from Germany. She is quite and some shy at first but comes on around once we get to chatting some more. She is out for a section with no real destination, just to hike some miles on the AT. Kentucky gal has been here done that and out for some more. Quite the talker we have to take a back seat to her conversation until Jim can arrive and give her some competition. NOBOs meet SOBOs. We are in a good mix of both sets of hikers here, heading each way. We all share our homes and destinations, experiences. So nice to have this visit time, now’s when I like to have that cocktail hour. A nice young man offers to get my water while he goes down for his. Thanks, it’s a little walk down for it and every step I don’t have to take is a bonus! Tiny Pants and Slim slide in about an hour after me. What? Well they had to turn back for TJ sticks. He left at that closed ice cream place. They give me an at a girl just the same. Come on in guys meet Kentucky and Anna.Before the night’s out Anna is committed to hiking out with us in the morning. She’s been doing some 7, 8 10 miles days and we push her to match our 14 planned tomorrow to the Lookout Cabin/Fire Tower. They say it is really cool and has 360 views. Peaches and the gang set up their camps. Nothing doing but that Double Dip and Camp Shoes get their fire going in our fire ring by the shelter. They build a smoky one too. Hey guys your running us out of here. I put my ear phones in to knock out their rowdiness.Night draws closer and my eyes close seeing those flowers in the fields from today. I set back down on that bench to relax and enjoy…..","Hanover/Norwich

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546522,"After last night’s smoke out my head was a little stuffed up this morning. Also sleeping with my head to the inside of the shelter didn’t help. Next time head out. We heard one in our shelter leave out extra early. She was stealth quite with only one time did I get a flash from her head lamp. She was right beside of Jim and he said he never really woke up when she left. Kentucky and I sorta get the rest of the shelter up and moving with our packing up.Another beautiful day too. Sun glistens thru the trees inviting us to the trail. We have a 14 mile day in store and we hear chance of storms this evening so let’s get started.Anna is up and ready to hike with us. With no real schedule she is game to join. That’s the way we roll. Each year we have someone who seems to find us entertaining to say the least and whom we decide just plain needs us. LOLThistle hill just keep giving us more than thistles. Radiant flowers cover our immediate return to a field. More views from Vermont. Just lovely. Rolling hills before and under foot. This is good to get us warmed up for the day too. Hey let’s eat some of these berries along the way. Second breakfast.Anna and I bring up the tailgate while the fellas b-bop on down the trail. Nice to have a gal to BS with. Another Anna for our original Anna. She tells me all about her previous hiking in Germany and Romania. She is in good shape but like all of us until you get that pack on and train you still have break-in time. Riding her bike to work over 10 miles has her trail ready even at the age of 54. There is less need for a car where she is from with rail systems. Word on the trail is Miss Janet is at Woodstock Rd close to a place called On the Edge Farms. We hope to see her today and of course will hit this little mom and pop store for one of our lunches. Ice Cream!! We missed that at West Hartford and TJ is all about it this time. A few miles seem to repeat themselves. Down a hill in the woods back up in a field. One stretch close to Woodstock Stage Road was lined with rock for over a mile, easy walking. Glad for it too, my foot hurts like a mutha every step. Anna says we should stop for it. No worries girl, I’m past the worst time to dig deep and keep walking. We do meet up with the boys while they stop for a break and food. TJ is downing his cliff bars and the last of his peanut butter. I’m eating sour patch kids mostly. Anna does understand the food intake yet and she carries way too much water at a time. 3 liters today and I’ve hardly seen her take a drink. Has bottles and an extra army canteen on the back. She did have it inside but found out it leaks. You guys walk too fast she gasps I must just stop at the next shelter Oh no you don’t you’ll make it to the Lookout. We hear it holds a bunch, a cabin with a deck area above it. We can tent too if we like. We’ll have to get water at Winturri Shelter though no water at the Lookout.Dana Hill stands in our way to the farms. Let’s just get over this gal and discuss over ice cream. Hot as the dickens in the fields. Grass smothers us. I take my sticks to keep parting it to find the trail. Ticks Ticks I know you are out there. Barns and Buildings we have to be close. The trail steps out to VT 12 we have a .02 walk. Miss Janet’s van is parked at a big farmhouse. Wonder if she is in here or at the store? Seeing a big fire ring at the back betting a party of a lot has been going on here each night. No hikers found.On the Edge Farms is a farm house turns garden spot, flowers, lawn art, green house, and barrels with goodies. Inside a counter with candies and cold box with farm fresh foods. Oh Oh country ham wrapped cheese sticks, gotta have. Breakfast samiches, egg and sausage. Yes. Hey there’s pizza up here too Jim spots…no no the lady running the store stops him, that’s my lunch! Fast thinking, it was good as gone. TJ gets his ice cream to supplement his lunch. The Peaches gang comes in and cleans out what is left of the samiches and hit the ice cream and soda stops.Setting outside on a back covered porch area we all gobble down our purchase. I notice Double Dip didn’t buy anything and is eating more of his trail mix so I offer up my jalapeño tuna, wrap and chex mix. He is happy to lessen my load. No since in me carrying it after eating what I just bought. Anna just nibbles on her trail bar from her pack while TJ goes back in for some hummus. Yumm may I have a scoop? We reload water from the owner’s sink inside. She is very accommodating and kind asking us where we are from and where we are going. Send me card she says I love to get cards. That we will do, thanks so much.I knocked on the door for Miss Janet and a fella comes to answer saying she has laid down for a nap. Guess she is getting ready for tonight’s bunch that might roll in. Tell her Lead Dog says hey and maybe we’ll see here again down the way.Humidity is kicking up. Them storms must be working. 6 more miles to the Lookout, which does set on an open ridge. Jim has already mentioned might not be the wise thing to be there with a thunderstorm above. Let’s see how things look as we progress. We can make the call at the Winturri, we have to get water there any ways.Trudging up in this hot field I am sucking down the water. Long switchbacks in high grass. Just keep moving maybe there will be some air stirring when we get to the top. The top never came it just graded out. Come on Anna we got this. She is already committed to stopping at the shelter for good. I am all for it too. It does make for a longer day tomorrow but its town day and we well walk till we drop to make that. Shelter .03 off the trail. And that is scratched over with a .04 and has pen writing water not good. We have already talked to many and they say there is water but slow, runs off some rocks back of the shelter. Down down we go hearing voices.Ground level shelter which looks to sleep 8 has 2 inside, Maps and Rich, brothers out for their section hike adventure. They have been thru all of the whites and one and his wife stayed at all the huts on a trip. That’s would be how I would spend my next trip back there. Larry you gotta bring your credit card though and maybe have a helicopter on back up in case you would like a lift out. The brothers are on opposite sides of the shelter. Too funny. He snores and I get up early, they say. We do better apart when we hike together. Settling in to my spot next to Rich I say if I roll over close just squeeze me tight I won’t bite.   Nice once again to be in camp before supper time. I can ‘freshin’ up from a sweaty day and hang damp hiking clothes to dry. We get water which does take some time with this slow thin run. Drops of rain start….Peaches, Double Dip, Camp Shoes, and Grizz come in. They aren’t sure if they are staying or going on to the Lookout. Long distance hikers hate to stop too early but the threat of thunderstorm has them debating. More and more hikers come. All the little camp spots start to fill in. Anna and I have eaten already and glad we did. With drops of rain less room will be available for mingling around with shelter. The ledge of this shelter isn’t big but there is a back covered setting area to cook on with some tree cover. The ledge fills up quick with boiling pots and the smell of food. I lie down on my mat area and watch the bustle begin.One by one a hikers comes to cook. I watch two guys cook up three meals a piece, adding spices to prepacked pasta, adding chicken, making tea and energy drinks. They ate for more than an hour. Double Dip and Camp Shoes got their fire going again and ate something in a pan and headed on for the Lookout. Peaches and the boys hit the back ledge and load up on food too. Jim and one of the other boys finish off my double serving of his chili which I heated up with some taco sauce and sundried tomatoes. When he dehydrated he made it a little hot which was perfect for me. It’s everything must go night on the trail. Eat whatever you don’t need for tomorrow tonight, we’re going to town baby!","Thistle Hill Shelter
",Winturri Shelter,"Jul 25, Mon",12
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546750,"The Brothers are up early readying themselves for their hike to the next shelter, oh about 10 miles. We follow suit, it’s town day baby. Big miles, a good 15 or more to reach the spot where we left off last year. Hope we can easily find where we took a side path from the bus stop near Rutland 4 and the Outfitter store. My goof last year so let’s not repeat this year. Anna don’t you take no 3 liters of water today. We will pass plenty. She has 2 liters. Not sure how much I have exactly but plan to travel light and gather I need. I hike out of here will suck, it’s straight up to get back to the AT and then we climb up to the Lookout cutoff. Still glad we didn’t push for it.The Brother’s head out but we catch them quickly on this up. Anna and I are just behind out 2 guys. TJ is all about seeing what we missed from the cabin and head up for it while the rest of us take a break after the first 2 miles. It’s a cool morning but sun is trying to pop out. Peaches comes barreling up, drops his pack, grabs his poptarts and water bottle and heads for the Lookout too. We hear 20 some stayed packed in the cabin. It didn’t storm really last night but did shower and we’d certainly gotten wet and slept tight if came here. TJ had a 360 view from the top of the platform, taking pictures for us to see later.Fairly flat trail leads us in and out of different types of hardwoods. Looks a lot like home. Rolling ups and down, some more steep than what the topo gives on the AT maps. Hate when that happens. TJ has busted out and flat left us. Feeling his oats the young man has his trail legs while us old folks just keep breaking down and putting one foot in front of the other. Jim leads Anna and I with us taking turns getting our second wind over the next 8 miles. Medicating keeps my foot from slowing me. Anna’s knees are shot and Jim is finally feeling some trail weary. He’s just about run out of his power food and has the real hiker hunger now. Glad he is with us more today. With Anna falling more behind us I don’t want to get too separated. She has no clue where the turn off is, even though quite a ways from here. She has said she can’t walk 15 miles but she has come close the past few days and we continue to encourage her. Still no TJ we can only assume he will stop at the next shelter, Stony Brook. There hasn’t been much water to this point but we really haven’t needed it either. The brook runs right over the trail. Let’s eat and cool our feet. Besides the Peaches bunch is here too eating. Jim reloads our water and eats while us girls have our feet soaking. The Brothers come on past and we say our last goodbyes so we think. One more big climb, Quimby Mtn and we’ll be to town. I can’t wait. Let’s find TJ. Not far up the way the shelter sign hangs with his orange hat on it. TJ’s clue, hey I’m here. He’s done his 10 x 10, at a boy. All while climbing up that ladder we pasted back there. What the hey?! Yep a sheer rock face with a ladder lashed to it. Guess prior you had to make up it the best way you could.Passing a clearing with several paths I check to make sure I’m on the white blazed one. Anna is out of my sight and the boys are ahead out of hearing. Hey Lead Dog you lost? Where did that come from? The Brothers are setting up their hammocks down from the clearing calling it a day. Hey guys you seem my guys? Yep they are just ahead girl. Ya’ll knock out your last miles and enjoy Rutland. Guys I sure hope our paths cross again, ya’ll been fun!Quimby Mtn gathers us all back up together again. It was a slow and steady climb but easy compared to all we have done on this trip. There are 2 false summits on the ridge line and I reach the first one without stopping. Makes me feel good too. Hey Lead Dog you kicking it girl, Peaches says. Hey I can climb regular trail dude. This is my element now. He laughs and disappears. A few second later Grizz shows and blasts past me. See you in town. Rolling across the ridge I keep hoping for a look out, some view. All that and nothing. Maybe the next peak will give me something. I know TJ can’t be far behind me. He only slacked back to visit with Jim and Anna can’t be far from that. Another dip off the ridge to only hike back up to another summit line. I talk to a hiker at the power line here which I thought would for sure give me a view but did not. He is hiking north and doing it for himself and the thoughts of his deceased wife. They had always wanted to thru hike but cancer took her. He plans to spread her ashes when he finishes. He likes my Virginie twang and that I am from close to Virginia Tech. He is familiar. So long Blacksburg Girl, finish that trail he calls out as I walk away. Oh here comes the down and here comes TJ. Good time for me to take a break. I collapse right on the side of the trail and eat snack. Jim comes in and does the same. TJ is stands while eating still in his pack. Young legs! The town down is upon us. 2 miles worth of great trail but it is eating up my feet. I walk slew footed and then side winder to take the pressure off the knees and the arches. Anna isn’t in sight. We plan to wait on her at the turn don’t worry. Closing in on Thundering Falls Road we aren’t sure just how far we have to go to find that side path. I’ll know it once I see it I say to myself. Parked cars at the road have me wondering if Anna will bail here. We cross a nice boardwalk and then hit the Thundering Falls where Peaches gang has stopped to eat full on again. These thru hikers don’t snack they pull out cookpots and boil it up. Moose is eating pouches of Coco mix straight out of the pack, coughing and washing it down with water. You go girl! Say isn’t this you guys top they say? No we have to get to our stopping point last year. Hope it is up ahead.Up. What? That’s not on this map. We climb up and then down and around the water and then leave it. We can hear the highway come and go. Damn have we missed it? TJ even goes down a wide opening on the trail that is unmarked. Nothing. Jim huffs and puffs in disgust as do I. Hot, tired, ready for that cold beer! The trail flattens and then a road? A dirt road, a few cars, humm, a pond. This has to be Kent Pond, we are close TJ. That path is just up there I’m sure. Clearing, canoes, a B&B then that sign we’ve been looking for, follow arrows for the outfitters!!! Yeah. Jim get comfortable in the yard for the boat dock and says he will wait for Anna. Its 4:30 or so, we can make the bus line, they run up till like 11:00 thank goodness. Ah yes I remember every step of this path now, following the arrows and the disc golf course. Hobbling behind TJ we crest out at the back of the outfitters. We’ve made it Tiny Pants, we’ve made it. Finding a chair I get out of my shoes and in my crocs and text Jim. He says Anna is just behind Peaches, they are hiking on to the road crossing and catching the bus there. Powerade down and a Vermont Slim Jim. That will tide me over till town and the Hoppin Moose. Resting on the porch of the outfitters sunshine parts the high clouds and I thank God for helping me/us find this finish. PS: An entertaining bus ride with some of the Jewish tourist and an angry bus driver made for a real trip into Rutland and the Yellow Deli, our hostel stay for the next 3 nights.Mr. Bus Driver “Do we need to get on now or wait till you come back?

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546825,"After our night at the Hoopin Moose, local brewery within walking distance, we crashed in our bunks at the Yellow Deli Hostel. We missed hitting the moose last year due to timing and their hours. Looking forward to this all trip we hit the showers quickly and rolled down the street for drinks and food as quick as we got into town. The beer was cold, the cooking service slow, the place was hot (no A/C, been out for a while) but the social time was great.Peaches, Grizz, Moose, Camp shoes, Double Dip and more all came in long after we had ordered our food. No time for this waiting, Double Dip said the heck with this and went across the street. We all waited out the storm while chugging different brews and loading up on appetizers. Anna was a good 3 beers in before her food came and it was a salad. Today we slept in, or at least I did. The fellas couldn’t believe I didn’t make the scene till after 8:00. Anna was up early and off for some sightseeing while in the states. I walk down to Clem’s diner to see if the fellas are there having breakfast and they are. County boy special please just as good as Cracker Barrel. Now where do we plan to eat for lunch?Rest and relaxation is on my agenda till then. We gather on the deck area of the hostel. It is sunny and has some shade too. I can get a little sun and sleep, nice. Setting up my tanning zone with my Tyvek and sleeping mat covered with a bath towel I stretch out to….what is that? It’s a Terodactyle! He is wound up like a top talking a mile a minute. Jim can you get a word in with this guy? TJ tries and just laughs. No sleeping now, I’ll just listen. He is from NH, 55 of age, just retired from 2 jobs, raised his 2 kids, has a wife who he adores and started his thru-hike in May. Said it was time to start living or start dying. He tried to leave and go to take a shower and get supplies for an hour while talking with us. Kept jumping up to leave and then his mind would spin another tale and off he’d go. Wew I’m worn out. Being a very humid day I couldn’t last long in the sun. Sweated like I’d been hiking but it felt good to do nothing. Shower time again and let’s go hit the town.Roots, that’s a cool name for a restaurant and says they cater to hikers. Meaning they will let a stinky dude in or gal. A very classy looking place, small but inviting. The waiter says he plans to leave Rutland soon and head for Roanoke where his brother lives. Not starving I order on the smaller side and eat every bite washed down with a Long Trail Ale. Tasty!Bar hopping time. Well we didn’t hop and we didn’t hit but the one, our regular stop found last year, Two Shays. Local hang out for a few regulars and has tvs for watching sports. Free popcorn and shelly peanuts. Can’t go wrong there. Hey Peaches ya’ll come join us. Before you know it’s a hiker hang out.Hey guys there’s some music tonight at the Deli. I’d like to see it. We hung out Two Shays for several hours and the bar stool hang on my legs has my feet pretty swollen even with my compression socks and trying to prop in a side chair. Time to go back to the hostel.I take this time to sort my items for our one last hike, 17.4 miles left of Vermont. Killington Mountain is our last hurray. Yep you remember I told ya about our missing this part last year. Time to pay the piper. We’ve washed our clothes and dried out shoes. I’ll get me a sub from Subway tonight, half for my breakfast and lunch. Slack the hell out that mountain!Music fills the deli downstairs. Our hostel quarters are upstairs right beside this establishment, all in one building really. Members of the deli’s seven tribes’ play their instruments, very festive like but conservative. The ladies in long dresses like Amish and the little ones all dressed alike. Men all have longer hair in a ponytail, most with beards but very kept. Foggy Mountain Breakdown is played and I feel like I should be dancing but refrain and only tap my feet and clap my hands with approval. They did it fine!Little Harry’s calls us. Another stop we found last year. Italian Restaurant recommended to us then. Came on Goat come with us. He is just arriving at the hostel and says sure. Young Canadian with a great accent. He is sectioning half the trail this year until time to go back to college and will finish next year. We will look for you down our way for sure. Anna, how was your day?Seafood tortellini and an ale. Nothing but chicken parm for Jim. He’s been about that since last time when Bones ordered it. He polished hers off and said that’s the dish for him. The waitress sorta remembered our Va gang from last year. Yeah we sat at the bar when you served us. She takes down the orders by trail name with a laugh. Tummies full. Let’s walk this off a bit by going to Walmart and Subway. Oh and we have to be back by curfew, 10pm or the hostel locks you out. No beverages allowed in the house either. Say where’s Peaches? Grizz says he and another are knocking out their ‘groceries’ behind Walmart. Oh goodness. Let’s get on back so we’re not rambling ‘round Rutland.","Yellow Deli

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546901,"Peaches lies on the couch this morning, we’ve had breakfast time to catch the bus for our ride up to the trail. Come on dude come join us? It’s a slack pack kind of day. Uhh no thanks, looking at his cell phone. He got in late and has to pack up his gear to really hike out of here sometime today. Moose and Grizz have already headed out on the early bus to slack Killington northbound. We will continue our southbound flow putting us up and over the mountain earlier in our day which I like. Hardest up first.Jumping on the bus our chatty friend is joining us, Terodactyle. He plans to get a jump on his other friends and put back on where they left off. They have already come over Killington and have their sites on New Hampshire and The Whites. But first he needs a drink, McGraths Tavern catches his eye and can’t get on the trail without stopping in for one more round. Good luck Virginia friends and he is off the bus.Anna has gone her separate way too. She saw no need to climb Killington with a full pack much less slack, she has other miles to fry. She headed out early for her ride on down the trail and has given us her contact info so we can keep track of her. Good luck to our new German friend you’re ‘Almost There’. She put this name on herself since she had none and while hiking with us kept saying to herself you are almost there, keep going, your almost there.Checking our coordinates after the bus drops us off we wanna make damn sure we are on the right path. This time is gonna be it. Sherburne Pass, Long Trail, Appalachian Trail. They all coincide. The Long Trail run thru here follows the same white blazes as the AT. Then will veer off for Canada. I’ll catch those blazes another time.Politely my guys let me go out in front. Like old times, it’s just a long day hike ya know. Well sorta except a few toes on each foot are numb and I ache more till I get warmed up. Hey but I’m traveling light only a sandwich, snack, water and Gatorade. I have no survival items once again unless my toilet paper and my shortsleeve shirt count. Wait I could start a fire with my lipbalm and a lighter. No worries it’s a beautiful day with another chance of a thunderstorm. Our only time frame is to finish with time to catch the regular bus out on VT 103. Oh what great trail this is. Good path winding up this mountain. Lush under growth as we pass the 2 mile mark. You know guys I’m only holding you up, why don’t ya’ll head on. I’ll be right behind ya. TJ is ready to roll once again. Jim not far behind him talking up a storm. Lots of day hikers are out on this Thursday morning. NOBOs are bound for town and plan to catch the same bus that let us off who runs that road regular. Just flag it down and she’ll stop. Hope you don’t get Mr. Personality we had a few days ago, he don’t care what ya do!The trail tops out and runs in a nice open like wooded area. No undergrowth, just needled forest floor. A few side paths cut in here and I hesitate a few times to make sure I am on the AT and not veering for Canada. LOL Rounding the mountain range for like 3 miles seems like I should be at the top by now. Two lovely ladies come along in fresh white long sleeve shirts. I have to tell them how peppy they look. A mother and daughter team packed very light. They are thru hiking having started in Pearisburg, What? I work in Blacksburg and told them I was from Carroll County. This cute little white haired lady about came out of her hiking shoes, jumping up and down with delight know we are from the same area. Her daughter will be heading back to school soon and this hike is her go between. We talked for almost 20 minutes. They asking question and me answering. Ladies you all be careful passing thru The Whites. It’s mean trail but with wondrous views. Ya’ll checkout my trail journals you’ll be in them for sure. Fast tracking to the top the fellas are eating lunch in the block shelter called Cooper Lodge. Not a lodge but guess they called it that since it is fully enclosed with windows and a door which neither by the way still existed. My sub went down quick, I was hungry. Lots of tents around too. Some look to be staying for a good while too, very large and have quite the supply set around them. There is a side trail to the top of Killington Peak which has a gondola and snack bar but I don’t see it. Must be on up the way. Jim leads us out from the shelter. 6 miles down and plenty to go. Seeing a sign I don’t realize it was the turn for the “peak” even though we continue to climb a bit. We start going down and TJ says what the heck, have we missed it? Yep I think so. Jim and I both would have probably passed on it but our youngin was up for another mountain to claim. Our easy down turns to some tangled roots and rocks for a while. The south side of the mountain is heatin up. I look back and see the peak now. Wow can’t believe we were just there. Looking down to my next twisted section Sprinkles and Grizz come up. They are dripping with sweat and moving fast. Another hiker is with them but I can’t recall his name. You got this Lead dog, you will have some town down with a rock scramble close your ending road today. And you guys got the other side. Once you crest you’ll be rolling off ol Killington. See ya back later.Ping ping, crack, crack. I hear John Henry working on his railroad. No it’s a Vermont trail maintainer’s crew. Hey guys ya’ll got this place looking fine. Thanks for all you do. Give me a big yahoo and throw up those hammers and hands I gotta take a shot of all yall. A big wide road slash trail puts me in the bottom lands finally. The fellas are waiting on me at a creek so we can get a little water. Chugging the last of my Gatorade I only want very little water to cap me off for the remaining 6 miles. Hey guys let’s stay together till we get across this Gould Brook, my guide shows it may be a ford. We’ve yet to have any real challenges with fording water and I’d like to keep it that way. Our trail runs along the bank and then an island of land the trail still runs along passed between two water ways. Wow this is soo cool. Wish I had videoed this. We walk till the land runs out and here is our crossing. Nothing to it. Rock hop made pretty easy with well-placed steps.Well you know if you’ve cross water you gotta go up. And then it happens? Rumbles being. Shit that storm is brewing. A hiker comes along asking how far to the next shelter. We just past one about 4 miles back. He books it.Heavy clouds roll over white and ominous, humid. It’s gonna get us. I stop to put my phone deep in my pack for protection and stuff that one dry shirt a little deeper too. I’m already wet with sweat so rain ain’t gonna matter. Still hoping we can out hike it the guys are pushing hard. This up will hinder our progress. Darkness comes over the woods while mother nature brews above.Giving the good Lord one more shout out for sparing me hardship I duck my head and get to digging. Dang am I gonna have to get my head lamp out. It’s only mid afternoon. The boys are out of sight. Just me and these woods. The skies open up….Rain so hard the trail turns creek in seconds. Soaked and socked in. The heat from under rolls up forming a thick wall of white. I part it heading out into a brief field walk. Now I’m really getting hammered. Hope this doesn’t turn to hail or it’s gonna hurt. Two landmarks are pasted, Lottery Road and Beacon Hill, I have less than 2 miles to go. The down off Beacon is a wet sloppy mess. I can see where the guys slid in the mud. Hoping I don’t plant in the middle of this I take a path with less mud and hope the shoes hold. I’m walking pretty fast for me I wanna get done and make that bus ride. A nice overlook comes into sight. I can see the airport from this side like I remembered last year from the other side. Same situation too, we got dumped on with ran closing into VT 103 then. Must be an omen. But with every bad deed the trail hands ya and wonderful one comes too. Rays of sun push thru the weather and cast sparkling light all around. Every leaf is dripping with water, brightness surrounds me, This, This is why I hike. Thank you for providing such beauty. I say it out loud. I only wish I had captured it to share but it’s in my mind forever. Now where’s that road?My watch says I’m gonna miss that bus and so does this last layer of rocks. This is the rock scramble Sprinkles told me about. Damn she’s right. Tedious steps down on wet rock will slow the pace. But hey better safe than sorry, I’ve come too far to take a bad fall now. Highway sounds come in ear shot. Bus or no bus I’m happy as heckter to have closed out this last piece of our puzzle. Relief and joy all at the same time. It ain’t no Katahdin but it’s my Big K, Killington, we slacked the hell out that mountain!PS Missing that bus only meant we could reunited with another trail angle we met last year, “Tom Plans too Much”, a local who shuttles hikes when in need. I called him up and he came right out to deliver us back to the Yellow Deli. A truck load of us too. Others in our same situation needed transport. Stay tuned for our last night’s celebration in Rutland.","Yellow Deli

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546920,"Returning to the hostel found us reconnecting with friends we’ve made along this journey. Ya’ll wanna join us for one last blow out before we hit the train home tomorrow? We three have some celebrating to do!I had reached out to Scruffy to see where he was on his path towards here. Sure enough when he got the message to get his butt to Rutland he pushed for a big day to be here tonight. Goat is still here as well having pulled his full zero. Peaches, ah Peaches, he had to walk out this eve and head on south. We will miss you my friend. Moose, you too girl. You keep out hiking them fellas.After a warm shower, clothes put in to wash, and shoes and pack out to dry it’s time for some Little Harry’s. Lookout town here we come. Walking there was a hobble but have more pep in these steps knowing its celebration time.Charlene, our previous waitress, sees us coming and gets us seated at our old table. Drinks around gal. Gathering orders she asks “what did hiked today and what’s next, Road Dog?” Yep I’ve transitioned names again, Lead Dog to Big Dawg and now this… Food and friends for us we are done on this adventure. Scruffy will head south and Goat will head north. Glad we all met in the middle. Speaking of meeting, you’ll never guess who walked in the restaurant, Milo! He and his wife and baby to be are visiting Vermont on a little vaca from NY. What a surprise. Another great friend made on the trail when we hike CT and few years ago. Little Harry’s treated us good again. Jim even ordered his same chicken parmesan, don’t mess with the best. Hugs and photos, thanks Charlene. See you next trip when hike the Long Trail. Let’s take the party on down the road and jukebox is calling us.Dropping the quarters on music and pool this hiker clan takes over the next establishment. First rounds on me, toast to good friends and happy trails! How fortunate to meet so many strangers who now have become longtime friends. We do attract the best!So what time is it? Long after 10…oh well guess we’ll have to sneak into the Deli. There is a back stairs entrance that connects to that outer deck. Hope we don’t have to send TJ up the scaffolding if that is locked. Say why don’t we just try the front door for old time sake?Pushing midnight we know nothing good happens after midnight we say our good byes and take our chances on that front door… Hello! We’re in like Flynn. Where’s my shoes, where’s my pack.. dark on the deck, stepping over sleeping hikers here outside TJ and I look for our stuff set out to dry. Got them cool. All safe. Night night fellas.8:00am Train time. Take me home to ol Virginie. I can’t believe this 3 weeks if over. Elated I am and proud of what we’ve done. The body is beaten but the heart is hungry. This trip has been by far the hardest I’ve tackled. Literally blood, sweat, and tears. But with my hiking buds we all completed this journey. Now it’s time to relax.","Rutland, VT

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549626,"Thanks to SlimJim Sunday kicked off our First Annual Appalachian Trail Family Hiking Day. The AT has implemented this event to encourage hikers to bring their families along to hike some of the trail and see what all the excitement can be about. We met over at Groseclose’s big red barn with the plan to hike over to the Settlers Museum and Lindamood school grounds. Jim rolled out early from his camp bed over in Bland to set up his car as a shuttle vehicle on the way back. When Larry and I arrived at the barn there he stood, phone in hand with Buddy Coonhound awaiting hikers to arrive, having hiked from his car over to here. Humidity has the fog hanging low this morning and a bit of fall in the air. This will be my first hike since returning from New Hampshire and I am looking forward to it. Captain pulls in planning to help with shuttles too. Seeing an opportunity to cut this already short jaunt even shorter Larry works his own magic. Say Captain why don’t I head over with you to the Museum and we walk back till they come to us? Bing bing bing the winning answer.Closing in on 10am our departure time a car pulls in and 3 gals get out. I recognize little Anna, not the Anna ya’ll know but a 15 year old from my country club. She and her mom, Julie have brought a friend (Lori) to join us. Great to have you gals along.Jim leads our harem while the other boys drive over to Lindamood. As our PATH expedition leader he informs us our duties to the trail… Leave No Trace…Pack in Pack it out, Don’t pick the wild flowers, stay on the trail to lesson erosion. Buddy sets a nice leisurely pace giving us time to talk and get to know one another. Julie has a small workout group in Bland that help each other stay in shape. Hiking most weekends they are looking to venture out. Hey gals I’m looking to get more to hike with me. Shoot it is usually just me and Jim, Bonnie and sometime My Anna and TJ. We need ya’ll and you need us. Numbers exchanged to see where this can go.Pick up some sticks ladies we have some trail maintenance to put in place, Jim instructs. See those blazes, if we lay sticks here to block this roadbed which looks like the way to go your eyes will lead you to the marked path without diversion. And what do the blue blazes mean girls? Education of the trail is passed along and we soon run meet up with Captain and the L-Train.They have walked in farther that I expected and it was good to see. Gather around ya’ll let’s get our family photo for the record. Little Anna leads us on to the school and museum from her. Wow this place is old!Jim has reserved the pavilion for us to gather for lunch. Providing his homemade cobbler made the trip all worthwhile. The boys have it for lunch and dessert cutting it before Jim could pass out the free National Parks passes provided by the ATC. Touring the grounds we realize what a wonderful area we live in and how easy it is to meet new friends along this trail. Thanks Jim and the AT for giving us something new to share.","Groseclose, The Barn

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550713,"Not having hiked really since our trip to New Hampshire my mind races with excitement of what’s to come here in Pennsylvania.   Planned is 4 days’ worth of day hiking. Will it be as rocky as they say? Can’t be as hard as the Whites! Will my feet hold up, my body? 10 weeks off the trail has me wondering.Larry and I drove up last night after work and Shortcut has come up from her home in Brevard NC to join in. She has hiked most of the section I plan to do but has today’s miles to walk and a tad tomorrow. It will be nice to have company along the way. Not that Larry wouldn’t do but…. as you guys know double digit miles aren’t on his monitor. The L-Train is a much better shuttle driver instead. Back to Moonshine Road we are hiking north for 12.8 miles to another road crossing, PA 501. It’s a brisk fall morning putting us both in our warm jackets to start. Fog is burning off quickly with blue skies pepping in and out. I think we helped the fog blow out with all of our conversation. We chatted up a storm catching up on our past month’s activities and where we can hike next.Very little elevation gain lends to a nice tread way. We pass over the historic iron bridge at Swatara Gap and soon find a biking path is the trail. Shortcut spots a ‘cave’. “Let me get my light and see where it goes” Goes, shit I see where it goes, into a dark hole. I’ll stay right here thank you. The interstate pass above us and this cave looks to go underground beneath it. Water deters her advancement and we move along.One small incline and we are on the ridge for the rest of the day. Cobblely rock underfoot comes and goes but mostly a fairly easy walk. I can only recall one bad boulder like section which made finding the path a little tricky but we figured it out.Breakfast gone we stopped for second breakfast at our first chance at an overlook. This wasn’t really a designated spot but foot traffic to a ledge was spotted and we took it. Warm in the sunshine but still cool in the shade of the remaining leaves we enjoyed our spot. Shortcut leads us on to William Penn Shelter. She has a good pace. Can’t keep this ol’ gal from making miles. Works well with me, my feet are killing me. I hope it’s just arthritis and pop some vitamin I for good measure. We meet a few section hikers out for a long weekend and a few SOBOs. They are on the push to make Springer before Thanksgiving. Just shy of the shelter we run across a 1000 mile marker that hikers have noted by placing stones in the trail. “1001” it reads. We on the other hand only have 4 miles to go. Eating lunch we wonder if Larry has remotely thought about coming to get us. Good thing it’s a Friday and not a sports filled Saturday. He’d be glued to a tv. We left instructions of how to find us and he plans to walk in and meet us as we finish up. Say 3:00. A quick text to report our location and we are off. Two overlooks to pass too before finishing. I like that. More rocks to add a change of pace and we come to Fisher lookout. Talking up a storm I hear another voice ahead, it’s the L-Train coming our way. “Where have you 2 been? I’ve been walking for miles!” Following my train we come to Kimmel Overlook. As Shortcut put it, “amphitheater style rocks” looking over Pine Grove. We’ll be down there soon enough for early dinner at O’Neals Pub. The sound of the road tunes in, our first day in PA has been real okay.","Moonshine Road, Swatara Gap

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550725,"Grab your gun boys it’s huntin season. Duck and cover, bob and weave, don’t shoot, don’t shoot, I’m a hiker. We adorned our blaze orange again today but today was not like yesterday. It’s Saturday and the crazies are out. That does include me! I had talked to a local from here and he warned me to be sure an wear blaze orange because of hunting season. He mentioned bow but uhhh these are rifles I am seeing and kids carrying them too. Shortcut and I felt like moving targets. And as she put is we ain’t the fast moving kind either.Larry dropped us off around 8:00 and the parking lot was beginning to fill. Groups of boy scouts heading out on their trips and those of us doing day hikes all heading in the woods. I not only have my blaze hiking vest that reads “Don’t Shoot, I’m a Hiker” on it but have my orange shirt and hat on. Shortcut sports her lime green jacket and soon puts on her blaze orange wool cap. Way too hot for it but shit we don’t wanna take any chances. Heck we hadn’t been in 100 yards and feel like a deer in the headlights. Gunman are sprinkled in the woods with every cut of my eyes. Good Lord, Oh Lord watch over us. Ummm aren’t guns prohibited within so many feet/yards of the trail? I’m sure that rule is broken. Trying not to be too disruptive to their past time we do not talk loud but do make sure we are seen. I feel our pace quickin as we get deeper into our morning which only lasts about a half mile together. See Shortcut’s time with me will end at the game service road we soon approach. She and Pokey (another hiking friend) have already walked from that point on to Port Clinton. She just lacks this little section to make sure she has all her blazes. “Boy I hate to turn back and go thru the gun range again” she says. Stay low girl. Sing a song if you have too. I’ll take my chance this way. Beside I need to pee and not sure if I wanna wonder too deep off the trail, my get taken for a white tailed deer. HA HA Our time has been too quick to come to an end but oh so fun. Can’t wait till we can hike again real soon. Departing our ways I am off for Port Clinton. Larry is targeted to meet me around 4:30 and again plans to walk in to meet me coming into town. My guess it won’t be a long walk because the trail from the parking area looks to turn straight up hill after the railroad tracks. No train goes straight up hill especially the L-Train.Another warm day with a slight chance of a shower. I am packed light again and feet feeling so much better. Not sure why but the aching I had yesterday seems to have subsided. This fairly flat trail helps too. Only short sections of rock mess to slow me down and then boulevard path reappears. Get it girl.I meet a SOBO from Missouri. She is all smiles telling me she will hit the 1000 mark today. Yep I saw it yesterday, William Penn Shelter area. I warn her of the upcoming ‘firing range”. If you have something bright put it on. She had looked in trail towns but found nothing and is just taking her chances. Moving along the ridge the trail goes in and out of State Game Lands. Lots of side paths making me wonder where they lead. Coming up on my 6 mile mark it’s not quite 11 but time for a snack. A hiker with his dog tell me the shelter has water and a view but is .3 off the trail and I really don’t need water so don’t go down to it. I do want a view out and he says his camp spot at Auburn lookout was nice. So I’ll plan to make a stop there mid afternoon before the push to town. I text Larry to let him know progress.Water so far over the past two days is sparse. Just like last trip up here. All ridge walking keeps you from springs and shelters have been placed off the ridge to access what water can be found below. Day hiking is no big deal but thru hiking this would be a problem to contend with. After a couple more miles of smooth sailing I decide I’d better eat lunch and give mom a call since I told her I would and tell what all I am seeing. Was hoping for a grand overlook to enjoy the farms of PA but none just yet to brag on. Soon I know I’ll see them soon. Reconnecting with the trail has hit me more so today. I think because I am walking alone and can really absorb my surroundings. Every fern patch has its sweet smell of fall. A hawk followed from above. His call was distinct. Oh and the interstate, yes I could hear it all day but far enough away to be faint. The brief walks in and out of the woods across field roads for farm equipment was nice too. Corn and hay smelled like home. Hunters or farm boys having their weekend fun in the back woods could be seen. I soon run up on a local who was out for his exercise. He lived just over the way and gave me great information about what I have ahead to walk and also to see in town. Don’t miss the Port Clinton Hotel. Great food and loads of it. Hiker friendly place. Nice, I did want to stop there so it is confirmed. He says You aren’t from around here are you? TN, no GA maybe NC he asked. Close but good ol Virginie I tell him. We must have talked for 15 minutes. I have go got a train to meet….Readying for the down to town I cinch up my shoes. Steep this ain’t steep. Well to the normal eye yes but to an individual just having hiked her hardest hike every this was a piece of cake. Yes my toes rammed the toes of my shoes. My feet slid trying to hold ground. Sticks digging to keep my upright but NO this wasn’t that bad. I am tarnish from NH trail that’s all there is too it. Scampering down this half mile stretch leaving a trail of dust in my wake I break into town and the train tracks. Lots of tracks. Sure hope a train doesn’t come I wouldn’t know which rail to hop first to get to safety. Following the blazes is always an adventure more so in town than in the woods. Scanning for the next one it turns from rail to bike trail and I’m on my way to the pick up zone. Yo L-Train where you be? Shoot I walked right past him while looking for blazes. He calls and is quick to pick up his chic. Port Clinton Hotel here we come.","PA 501
",Port Clinton,"Oct 15, Sat",14.80
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550886,"Heading back to Port Clinton I am expecting a hard climb which is usual from a town. Also I will have the most elevation fluctuation of this trip and expecting more rocks as warned by Shortcut. She has already walked yesterday's and today's miles and tried to give me her recollection. Heavy fog and cooler temps with a chance of rain have me packed with a few more items to be ready in case. Larry drops me at the fire station where I walked to yesterday. ""I should be a little later this eve, say 4:30, will text as I move along, don't hit the Yuengling Brewery and forget me"". So far so good with this shuttle man. He's pretty dependable but doesn't allow stinky hikers and mouthy women so I'm on my best behavior. A kiss good bye and I'm off.Blazes lead quickly from town onto a bike path and then turns under PA 61, the road we just traveled in on. Graffiti colors the bridge pillars. Is that hiking gear? Sure enough, a hiker has camped here for the night, left his gear, bag still stretched out, cook pot and pack. I scan for him or her but don't see anyone. Three options, they walked over to Walmart for resupply or maybe getting water or food in town. Turning on the trail which heads to my climb of Blue Mountain the trains sound their whistles as if to tell me ready set go. A SoBo greets me immediately all smiles to be reaching the town I leave. Say is this the turn on Schuylkill trail and to Walmart? Yes sir I do believe so. Enjoy town and good luck onward south.My up turns out to be quite easy. Well graded and this cool morning I barely sweat. Two weekend hikers come my way after having their first camp out. They are locals and tell me to enjoy my trip and stops at Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle. Reaching the first part of the ridge I smell smoke, it's where the morning SoBo spent his night. A few more camp spots are passed and the skies start to clear, some of the weather moves out. I also notice all the springs noted in Awols guide and my ATC map are dry. Again glad I am day hiking. Creating what I feel is the top the trail widens like a forest road and more rock start to fill the path but still very manageable. Two more weekenders approach and confirm my trip over the next few miles 'through the watershed' will not be bad. Down hill brings me into a camp ground area with side paths to drive in camp spots. I can't see any of these but the guide says they are there and I believe it, folks are popping around every corner. 6 miles in, rolling on.A steady wide forest road leads up to Pulpit Rock. My mind races forming images of what this rock will look like. Will there be a podium to stand behind as if in church? The increase in elevation adds dampness and waves of light fog. Sure hope I can see out. A group of young high school, maybe college guys come around the next bend. Say fellas how was the Pulpit? They inform I will love it, worth the climb. So did y'all come from the Pinnacle too? Nah we thought this was it till we saw the sign. They made a wrong turn by road to get to this parks access. ""You fellas should just come on and join me, keep following the blazes this way and we'll reach it"". Laughing they turn me down and start my rock step climb to the summit.Hoping for a good overlook and place for lunch the Pulpit doesn't disappoint. There was no podium but I did find a nice location on one of the jutting rocks to preach from. Guess I didn't do it quite right, it started to sprinkle, the big man up stairs shut me down. Retreating to the cover of the woods to finish my lunch I watch all the folks that drove up stand in the passing shower. There is an astronomical park 30 yards from here and it's only a little over 2 more miles to the Pinnacle. Talking with a gal from NJ down to visit this area she is curious about my trip. Her son has considered thru hiking and wants him to meet me but he has already left the rock to check out the park. She's hiked some miles of the AT in lots of states but not set her mind to completing them all but is quite happy I'm making tracks to complete mine. Texting Larry I let him know I'm still on schedule and will know more about eta once I hit the Pinnacle, will only 5 miles left from there.Let the rocks begin. The whole 2 mile stretch from overlook to overlook was a real pain. It didn't slow me to a halt but but did keep my head down to keep from twisting ankles and stubbing toes. One area was a boulder hop, a real stick bender if you were to take a fall. Lots of day hikers coming and going too. Wonder how crowded the overlook will be? Says panoramic view, I can't wait.An unmarked blue blazed path turns from my white blazed path, this must be it. People are scattered all around so I want to be sure I am on the right course and ask a guy to confirm. Yes ma'am, just pick up a rock and throw on the upcoming pile and walk straight ahead to see. I follow his orders and find a stone and pitch on a giant pointed mound of rocks. Groups are seated on every ledge looking over the Pennsylvania farm lands. I keep walking looking for the end and a place to light. Full up. I don't really care to squeeze around folks. Not only interrupting but kids and ledges don't mix. Shoot even grown ups can make bad decisions. So I find a little nook out of harms way to capture my view and chat with older couple. He likes my Don't shoot I'm a Hiker orange vest still attached to my pack and takes a picture. It wasn't really needed today but better safe than sorry. Hazy skies prevent a good photo op so I move on along and gear up for a 5 mile down hill slide to Eckville. People are looking for their paths back to their cars asking if I've seen the yellow trail. Umm think that was back behind me but you'd better ask a local to make sure. Wide forest road again, rock covered but more like heavy traveled road to keep from washing. More watershed area so maintained for truck travel. I do believe my hardest is behind me.I only pass a few climbing up on this side of the mountain. Some knowing how far they have to go and others looking for good news or at least a lie to say not far now.   One hiker was setting on the side of the trail cooking himself a meal. That's gotta be a thru-hiker I presume. Say you heading south? You need anything? I'm just heading to the next road. No he was just calling his 5 day trip over and eating up a meal before catching a ride back at a parking lot trail. He had past his last water source for a while and saw possibility of rain moving in tonight. Thanking me for offer I wave goodbye and kick on down this hill.This tread way is getting old on my feet but making good time trumps it. Thinking I will walk right out to the hard top by way of this forest road a blaze tells me different. I can hear a car or two so I am close. Say where's the L-train? He should be walking in to meet me. Stepping from the woods onto the road I've arrived ahead of schedule again, he was just ""thinking""of coming in. Yeah right.   You can't trust these shuttle guys. Say can you give me a ride back to the Port Clinton Hotel? I'm hungry.","Port Clinton

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550926,"Day 4 is upon us and our trip is coming to a close. We had a great second meal at the hotel in Port Clinton. I got the smallest steak. Is a 14 oz ribeye small? And it came with 3 sides. Yes 3. Larry had the haddock and some of my steak. We left stuffed and happy. Now let’s burn all off today.Back to where I left off on day one with Shortcut. She walked my section north to south and said it was quite rocky at her finish so I’ll get thru that first thing this morning. Good, get it over with. I see I will have a couple of overlooks and a monument to pass. I’m back in those State Game Lands so hunters may still be out even on a Monday. Blazed orange and ready. Larry again will meet me on the other end and get his walk in. We’ll see about that. I see a path leaving the parking lot and head on out. Very distinct but….ummmm I haven’t seen a blaze and I’ve come to a cross path that is blue. I have missed something so I about face going right back to the parking lot, Larry is just pulling off and doesn’t see me in retreat. Blazes across the road guide my eyes in a better direction to see blazes I should be following and oh yeah that rocky trail.Winding, wooded section, very peaceful, and fall like. Colorful shadows cast along this ridge, just me and the morning birds. With this being a work day I don’t expect to see a sole. But get a surprise around the bend, a Flip Flopper. That’s a hiker who’s started at one point and then flips ahead up the trail and hikes back. Sorta what I’ve done on my trip this weekend. He started in Georgia, hiked up to Harpers Ferry and flipped up to Katahdin and is now heading back for Harpers Ferry. Oh he is so close to his finish. I can feel it in his tone and see it in his eyes. Packed super light and looking lean he wishes me safety over the upcoming boulder hops on wet rocks, dew from last night. I cheer him on as he disappears out of sight. Still glad to be hiking this part first in my 9.8 mile day, I’m almost at my first overlook. Haze hangs over the valleys so photos still not the best to take but snap a few just the same. Showers Steps is next and the best view of the day. Beats working I note and text out to rub it in. This is the life. I know now why it is I love it out here. Separation from the hustle of life, connection to a better place, since of freedom and calmness. Now I just need to keep this in mind when planning my big hikes. Keep it simple and enjoy the moments and the places. I’ve been trying to complete the trail in a window that suites me but have put a little pressure on myself to do so and with that has come some not so pleasant days. No pain no Maine they say. Bottom line I’m a section hiker, a day hiker, not a thru-hiker so don’t try to be more that what you are. Am I at the Pulpit again cause I feel like I’m a preachin? Coming to the only down of the day I parallel a boulder field, so glad the trail turned right to miss that, and takes be down to a large fire ring and campsite area. Still not really hungry I only stop for a snack and map check. Send a few phone messages and let Larry know I expect to see him in the next hour and a half. We can meet at the mile mark left if he comes on in and we can see that monument together.Back up a slight knoll the trail is wide with paths around what looks to be bottom land which catches standing water. None now but bet it is full in the spring time. To avoid patches like this many trails are formed side by side to keep the feet dry. Very cobbled with rock and leaves it’s a ankle workout. Birds birds birds, they come in masses lighting in the tree top chirping. Dampness is in the air but it is still warm and overcast. Maybe they are telling me a storms a coming. I can see signs of hunters. None spotted but I find sunglasses and see deer fur along the trail where one has been drug out. I check over my shoulder every now and again just for good measure. Seeing a blaze hat coming my way I give pause at first and then see a shirt marked with a white blaze and realize he’s one of us. Say have you seen a camera he asks? No sorry. He thinks he lost on this section yesterday and heads on to look. Reaching the Fort Dietrich Snyder monument I pause to scan the cross paths. One leads to water and other just looks to be a hunter’s path in the weeds. The blazes aren’t very good here and I finally see the double which I need to take. The monument from 1756 for a fort built to help protect against the Indians. I look for an old block structures but don’t see right off and head on down the way.In a few short minutes here comes Larry. “Told ya I’d be in to catch you he says” Just barely, isn’t the road just a quarter mile away? Yeah but hey I’m here. Yes you are, I turn around and walk back to the monument and send him on back up over the cobble stones from which I’d just come and don’t really want to rewalk again. My section hike has come to an end. Feeling fulfilled I set up on a rock by the road and wait for Larry to finish his walk back. A hunter comes out of the woods to his truck from where we just were. Too warm for the animals to be moving he says. Yes just perfect for us hikers I say with a smile.","PA 501

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551286,"Damn Damn this traffic jam. Cars line the highway, the parking lot is full, hikers scamper across the road hoping to miss speedy cars before their boots can hit the AT. This is no joke dangerous. The ATC is already looking to alleviate this problem but today we are here in the middle of it. All the more reason I chose to hike path less traveled, south of McAfee, Sawtooth Ridge.The L-Train knew he didn’t have a need to return up to the knob, it’s all up hill that way. So let’s hike the little 6 mile connector section from McAfee parking over to Rt. 624, Dragon’s Tooth parking spot. We have TJ and Jared in tow which will provide our two car drop. Driving past the knob we realize we’ll most likely be parking our other car down on the side road. Leaving my car over at Dragon’s tooth worked well. TJ’s jellybean is a small car we can squeeze in some place. And that we did. “Hey does this count onto our 6 mile day?” We hike up the side road just to get to our starting point. Cars are packed and some double parked. I foresee some towing going on. I make a bet we’ll only see 1 or 2 hikers on this side and predict they will be close to our end. That bet turned out somewhat true. Jared is our newbie today. He is a good friend of TJ and Anna’s and has heard a lot about our hikes and decided to come along. This is where TJ got his trail name, right there on that rock he points out, Tiny Pants was born! Of course we have to start up… not on Larry’s agenda. Hey thought this was a ridge? The trail has to get there dude, hang in there. We can see the Homeplace and red roofed houses all to our right. Larry uses these to track our progress only to find out there are so many red roofs he isn’t sure if he is moving at all. Come on Sweeper, get the led out!Small ups and downs, ups and arounds, the trail does walk the ridge and thanks to some nice trail management misses some of the old ways of going straight up the peaks. Leaves cover everything, watch those rocks under foot they’ll trip you. Vibrant yellows light up the woods. Foliage and Sun. The fellas talk ball and I take in the fall.Don’t tell Larry but I think this will be our down to the field. Jared is close behind and checks his watch for distance traveled. Two ladies come up the way, smiles and sweat. The have started where we plan to finish. Yep that confirms it we are across the sawtooth. Our sweeper has gained ground and talking up a storm. He must have caught his breath. Jared and TJ listen attentively. More hikers come up from the field. A whole group of weekend backpacker, one barefooted. Young college kids I presume. They have already hiked from Dragon’s tooth and moving fast. Crossing thru the field and new walk thru stiles I trump Larry on stopping here for lunch. I remember there are some rocks on up we can set on. But first we’ll chat with yet some more backpackers. These from Maryland out for a section from Andy Lane trail over thru McAfee. They are already talking of burgers and beers. Hey I know food Larry speaks up. If you need trail info talk to her but me I’m your guy on food! TapRoom is his advice for after hike refreshment down in Daleville. Thumbs up and we move on. All this talk of food I’m hungry.TJ packed some snacks for Jared and water. He was traveling super light, nothing. Eating half of my PBJ samich and I see a growing boy wanting. Here man take half, and down it went. I’m saving some room for Ironto’s Italian Kitchen. After a watch check he confirms only 1.2 miles left. I knew we were close. Only a little hill between us and may car. First we must cross the bridge….uh where did it go? Surprised I see the once iron/wood bridge here is gone, vanished? Guess a wash out occurred and the ATC just took it out. So we rock hop across. With only a mile left to enjoy on this lovely trail I take some solitude and break on out in my regular climbing pace. I’ll let them fellas bring up the rear with the Sweeper. He’s telling a big tale as it is. I meet one last hiker who had come from dragon’s tooth too. She said it was way too crowded. Ah you have come to the right place my friend, this is the place to be….the trail less traveled…enjoy!Note: The Italian Kitchen is only open WED thru Sunday. Opens 4:00PM. Sun at Noon. Needless to say we were disappointed to not get our fix there but plan to come back real soon. Just gives me a reason to hike longer and eat later.","Rt. 311 McAfee Parking

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552185,"It’s always nice to go back and visit old places but even more fun when you can introduce your old place to someone new. Our good friends we golf with and much more have jump onboard the L-Train for a tour. Yes Larry has planned our hike today, short and sweet with a little golf course involved.Rain pelts the windshield somewhat turning to sleet and or freezing rain. Hummm will this be a good idea for our first timers? Well even if it turns nastier we can plan to check out the old lodge and area buildings for entertainment. It will not be a bust.We parked at the new designated ‘day parking’ area at the Outfitter Building which has your tourist items for sale but also has staff to run the activities for the mountain. Maps, bikes, guided tours, treetop adventures for those wanting to scale up trees and test their climbing skills as well as your temperament for heights. (not open this time of year but you can climb in the spring) We browse while waiting on Larry to arrive; he had to work early this morning. Bringing in the bacon that boy is. Rick and Gina are dressed for hiking. Good boots, gloves, hats, layers. Gina pleads for easy trail and Larry provides pretty much. He requests that I drive up to the Blueberry Lodges area so we can park up past that first uphill right out of the gate from the hotel. He knows from experience this can be a little much when coupled with the remaining mile up to the old golf course clubhouse. Parked at the gate the sign reads 1.2 miles Golf Course Road. This wide fire road is a good warm up to get the day started. I take the lead with Larry and we are quick to realize our friends are slowing and my girl Gina is a tad red faced. Changing up the gears I take sweeper (aka back of the pack) and Larry pairs up with Rick for some trail talk. Wew I’d hate to see what you hike all the time Gina tells me. Ah you are just getting warmed up….Hell I’m sweating she gasps. I am trying out my new doctor prescribed insoles in my newest trail runners. We’ll see how they do on this short walkabout. Rain spits still. Cold but not bitter like it could be and Yeah no wind. Reaching the grassy open field of the course I am surprised that fog hasn’t set in on us and we can see out mostly. Larry begins his tour talk, this is where this green was, and this is where this fairway goes, and don’t you think this could be a par 3? Rick listens and makes his own assumptions too. Gina and I roam around behind and look for our opportunity to see off the ridge. She spies an opening in the short trees along the field’s edge and leads me over for investigation. Excited to just be out I let her take the lead on what’s next and I spy a disc. This area up here now is a disc golf course. A purple disc has flow astray from its owner and left behind not found. Hey let’s see if we can make a hole in one!!! I take a toss at a basket and am far from accurate. Gina give a toss and says I’d rather play GOLF! I’ll keep this lost and found for TJ and Jared to fight over.Reaching the rock ruins of the clubhouse Larry continues his tour. Wonder if they had electric, water, theirs the fireplace. Maintainers have added some board rails at the overlook behind the clubhouse for safety and they look nice a rustic too. We loop around the rest of the field and head down to our next trail junction. Down? Does this mean a climb back up our newbies question? Well Larry…you’re the guide, what say you? Oh it will be fine he says just follow me. No big climbs on my train.Ah into the woods, now this is home. I’ve missed this and am getting the fever to get back out every weekend now. Gina steps easy on these wet leaves. Easy girl we don’t want to take a fall.The down was pretty short and slopped to the stream and then we begin our slight up which will round us back to our car. No sure about distance myself can’t be far, this white dot trail stated 1.6 on the sign at the field. We do warm up a bit and shed a layer. Rick looks back to check on his lovely who is doing great but has that look of how much farther. Keeping conversation we about future golf trips and some of my trail experiences. Hey gal there’s the water tank not far now.I don’t want to say it and not be right but only a few yards from the car….Guess what I see? Better be the car she gruffs!!! Bing Bing Bing jackpot. The rain has picked up this last little bit and looks as if to set in for the moment. Our tour guide mentions the stables which I’d put in for a hike too but shake him off. Let’s turn this tour by car. Cheers all around the vote was settled.Hips and legs were stretched, laughter and friendship shared as we drove over the grounds pointing out the larger hilltop lodges, retreat center, the dried up lake. Yes all the water that was gained over the past few years after its “leak” has all disappeared once again. We checked out the Dirty Dancing memorabilia in a small building and the memory rock for Patrick Swayze down by the old pavilion. The hotel was closed to our surprise so we didn’t get to share the historical pictures inside with our guests. Fingered the staff was taking a break after their big Thanksgiving feast. The door said reopens today, Dec 6th. Cool gives us a reason to come back. And back we shall go…. There’s Bald Knob yet to hike folks. (It’s the best overlook up here) Oh and the hike to the stables and War Spur and we can show you to the AT and to Wind Rock…oh I could just go on and on. Lots more to see.","Mountain Lake

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552854,"Today trail was suppose to take me to the Cascades but my hikers were all busy. So this gal changed up her trip for a place I do love and for some mountain to climb.The closer I came into Giles County the more winter like it was. Yes, snow still dusted the ground and I could the ridges were white. Parking at Pocahontas road brought back memories of last trip here and a flat tire was found when I returned from my hike that day. Hope that isn't the story today. A cold breeze has me reaching for my wool hat and gloves. I don't add a jacket knowing it's all up from here and will be pulling it off in a short minute. Stepping onto the trail and seeing my white blazes I know there's no place I'd rather be.Climbing the few switchbacks and ready made rock steps I hear coon dogs yodeling off in the distance. 2 sounds like with one mostly doing the calling. They are tracking hard. Twenty minutes in and I've reaching the fire road. Wow that didn't take long. The dogs are real close now. Buddy is that you? His baying painter stays on his course, I don't see him, but this blue tick hound has found me. Not knowing how well he will react to me taking his picture I remain on my course and walk up the trail as he comes down to me. Nose to he ground, his tracking collar on so his master can find him, he sniffs my shoe tops as I reach for a pet on the head. Nope I'm not his type or what is looking for and off up the hill he goes. The barks fade to no more.Snow thickens as I increase elevation. No footprints of anyone to follow either only a deer track or so. A few birds dart in the trees and a woodpecker knocks. Soon I hear the trickle of a stream. It's the shelters water source. I know it and its location. The rock work still shows from the trail maintenance. A long black pipe lays back into the source the provide easier access when filling a bottle to filter and drink. Blue blazes mark the spots best. From here I know I'll have a sharp 90 degree turn right and start that last step ascent to the shelter. So just hiking along I don't really look for blazes just follow the 'trail'. I remember stepping on a very large snow covered rock thinking I don't remember this before. Walking on immediately I know I'm on newly laid trail. Blazes still mark the way and remnants of old pink tape around a tree off 2. Ah yes the VT maintainers have worked this so there will no longer be that step climb. The trail now skirts below the ridge and the shelter coming into the old original path. The wood stile to cross the fence still is here and for the first time boot prints remain in the snow. Ah the fields don't disappoint. Some blue sky helps brighten what has been an overcast day. Wind whips what grasses that have managed to stand over toe snow cover. I'd say four inches and with some drifting more. Quickly I get my down jacket on so my picture stop doesn't chill me. Party hat on, beads adorned, festive mask with feathers-fluttering, oh and my party horn. It's Happy New Years time! Looking off over the towns below I yell it!! Time to tuck tail and head for cover. I notice what was once a white blaze is now blue leading to the shelter. Seating up inside I get the shelter log and look over its entries. Pretty Boy has signed in October 9. He'd be about here according to when we met him in New Hampshire. His entry say he had hiked a 25 mile day and was excited about getting to town. I scan for more names I might know and have a quick snack. Signing in myself I decide I will be a bit adventurous and take 'The Captain's way' off the mtn. Well almost. I know the old steep way has to connect to the new way and suspect it will at that big rock step. All white blazes are blackened out by the maintainers. Oh and they had done a fine job at junking up the old trail so not to look like a path any more. Trees have been downed and bush drug in. Bushwhacking time and time to get out of this down jacket before I rip it shreds. Crossing logs and ducking branches I make my way off and back to the AT and to the big rock. Was it worth it? Yea, Just so I could say I did I guess but wouldn't recommend again. I could have walked the new way, which is longer, just as quick. Retracing my footsteps it takes no time before I'm back at the fire road. My hike is coming to an end. It's been just me and 2 blue tick hounds. (Sounds like a country song).

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553416,"There’s a trail saying, No Rain No Pain No Maine. Well I’ve hiked a little in Maine and believe this tale. Now I gotta get ready. Today’s walk in the woods takes me and Bon Bon over some old stopping ground. It’s an easy two car drop and pretty close to home. The only problem might be if rains. Well it did last night and supposed to have clearing by hiking time. Another saying, never trust the weatherman. Fog! We don’t care about no stinking fog. We met up at our park-n-ride spot and then follow down to Sarver parking area where we leave Bonnie’s car. Pulling into the Niday parking area I call it the lot was quite a mess of big mud holes. The winter ruts have begun in these spots and some maintenance needed. It’s a somewhat warm morning but heavy with fog so very damp. No rain forecasted today but betting we have no clearing. Bonnie ditches some extra gear to lighten her pack and we are off for this first 4 miles of climbing to the top of Sinking Creek Mountain. Some winding around the valley and we soon arrive at Niday Shelter and begin the real push for the top. I’ve walked this many times but keep thinking we’ve reached the top with only false turns to tell me otherwise. The lack of seeing what’s on ahead keeps us wondering. I can tell it’s been too long since I’ve really put some miles on these legs. Not really tired yet but know its coming. Bonnie agrees as she lags back a few times and I get a jump on her. This ain’t nothing I tell her compared to NH. Not even close. That’s why “we” gotta hit more and more climbs and rocks and steps and….she interrupts….what’s this ‘we’ business? “Oh yeah next trip will be repeated up and down hikes of Sarver, you in?” I say. NOPE… I’ll hike up once and down once and wait on you at the car. We roll along the trail as the fog rolls along over us. Where’s that sign? Eastern Continental Divide. I know we are close. Bonnie confers. I remember this, gotta be close to the top. Finally the blue marks and the sign provide us with relief. I reached it a few minutes before Bonnie and she says the trail needs some more white blazes back there, “ I just about got lost and hootie hooted”. Funny I know exactly where that was too. All ridge top now we have smooth sailing…oh never trust your memory. Oh man I forgot all these rock slab areas. Shit. We both had recollection but not of this many. Good training I chalk it up to. Balance and precise steps. Sticks are useless on wet rocks, that’s a fact. Slow and steady easy Bonnie. I cross one section and then wait for her to make her pass. Getting a little ahead I turn and hear a commotion. Wham Bam No thank you Ma’am. She’s down. Nothing hurt thank goodness. And then it’s my turn. I have a slight crack for a foot hold and trust it and my next step will hold too. NOT, Woop woop Woop, Down hard enough to rattle my teeth and make my head hurt. Bonnie yells MARTHA MARTHA, expecting me to keep sliding on down the slope. Luckily a little nubby tree caught my arss and held me to the rocks. Scrambling to get back up we laugh at each other and decide we need lunch at the next available spot.Warmth of the sun tries to burn thru the fog but never clearly makes it out. We’ll take what we can get. Water droplets still hang from everything, every twig, branch, and blade of grass. It’s this high humidity that is keeping everything damp. Fueled up we are ready to bust out off of this slippery slope. No more old lady moments I announce. Well almost no more…those blow downs caused some bitchin and moaning as we tried to cross with the best of our abilities. Short legs make for some awkward ways of maneuvering under and over limbs. One place I was up and over suspended straddling a big tree and caught quite go either directions since my feet or sticks didn’t touch the ground. Bonnie says I’ll go under and gets stuck between the ground and the tree, pack hindering her movements. We laughed till we about peed out pants….oooops another old lady moment, damn. The trail turns ‘normal’ and we make good time over the next mile arriving at the Sarver Junction. Only 1.4 miles left and it’s all down. Enjoy these switches we say because it ain’t pretty thereafter. Steep Steep down the Sarver Holler trail goes. See I didn’t bring you up it Bonnie…yea I see how good you are, you made me walk up 4 miles instead of 1? HA Gotcha again. Well the down was no joke. My legs quivered and feet pounded as blood rushed to the toes. The path hasn’t been blazed in some time and only orange ribbons marked the trail. We had no real trouble following since it is a very old trek with lots of rock to hold its path running thru low scrubs. The powerline field was a sight for sore feet. Man glad we are down that and without any more falls. No rain, some pain training for that Maine = Loads of Laugh.","Rt. 621, Niday Parking

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553699,"We took a slew of hikers to the tooth today. More than my normal one or two and boy was it a treat. We tackled the tooth from both sides of Cove Mountain dropping one bunch at Trout Creek (Martha’s Mad Marchers) and then other group began at Newport Road (Bonnie’s Bad Boys). She had her hands full.The L-Train shuttled Me, The Kids , Hunter and Kelly. New names you say? Yes, Hunter was met during some trail work with the VT crew and has been to Captain’s sketti dinner before. He contacted me so join in with his girlfriend Kelly. She is from CT, here getting her masters from Virginia Tech, and loves to hike. Yeah girl!!! Larry will return back to Newport Rd and hop on the trail with Bonnie and Jeff. You see now what I mean when I say she has her hands full. Get them fellas to the top if you can.Rain from last night has things wet but no rain is supposed to fall till later this afternoon. Hopefully we will be off the mountain by then. But heavy fog surrounds us and looks like we’ll be hiking into the clouds. Kelly gets a quick introduction to everyone and falls right in line for our trek up Cove Mountain. Switchbacks help our ascents and get us warmed up quickly. Humidity is up and I’m ready to get out of my long pants as is she. Kids elected shorts to start with and now I’m ready for the same. It’s Anna’s first hike since sometime last year and the gym has her body a bit sore. Glad to have her and TJ back on the trail with me. Hunter works his way up our line so we catch up on what we have been doing since our last contact. Studies and some outdoors activities have had him busy. Nice you could jump in today. And even better neither he nor Kelly has hiked from this direction before so new trail for them.Reaching the ridge we are above the fog which has settled deep into the cove. How awesome. It’s a white sea separating our ridge from the one afar. Photo time folks, Cheeze…Ridge walking with some rock scramble. Oh I wonder how them fellas are doing? Jeff has some knee trouble and has gone to a brace for support. Today will be his first test on how it does. Tangling with the tooth might be a hard match.A few planes are heard above, Harry? They are in the clouds and never seen which brings me to tell about Audie Murphy’s crash on the mountain behind us. Ya’ll ever been to his monument? Kids have I know but Hunter and Kelly confirm not. Sounds like we have another destination to hike. Stopping for snack to keep us fueled on our 5.4 miles of up was much needed. If we are lucky we’ll meet up with the others at the top if they haven’t blazed off already. I’m targeting 12:30 for our arrival. They had 2.5 miles up on the ‘main side’. Hearing voices from the trail below we are close and here comes some hikers from the tooth now. No not our group but they say they might have seen a short round guy, a tall sweaty guy and a little woman. Yep that’s our bunch. LOLDragon’s Tooth, a tall monolith, with jagged edges for rock climbers and daring soles. I’ve climbed it before but usually with no one else around. It’s some busy today. Several on top, at the middle and bottom and there’s our 3. Bonnie and Boys have made it. Lunch time! 12:45We’ve all worked up a sweat and hunger. Hunter might have the best lunch of all if you like cold canned goods. Pulling our his can opener…only the razor side tied to a string…he opens his green beans first. Then rounds out his balanced meal with canned ravioli. Trail name: Canned GoodsLarry informs us of their trail of many tears….well it started off with Jeff losing his wallet. “What? How are we gonna pay for our food later Bonnie yelps at him?” Then he breaks off the bottom of his stick. Oh and that darn brace kept sliding down and that was all within the first 100 feet up the trail. Must have been that fast pace Jeff was setting… Run Forest Run. The youth in the bunch are ready to actually climb the tooth and slay that Dragon we all have been chasing so I prepare for photos. First a group shot before Bonnie’s three start off the mountain. They want a head start on the rest of us. Looking down from the middle ground I get the best photo I can of them all. Ok folks this gal is ready to roll off here, rains a comin and food a waitin. Kelly and Hunter take in the tooth from the top a little longer knowing they’ll track us down easily with me in front. Knees aren’t as agile as they used to be. Rock steps, some still wet make for a slow and steady pace. More people come up the trail, some first timers to the tooth. Enjoy, you are almost there. One group is totally spent but press on with some giving complaints of when are they gonna reach the top? Catching up to Larry he is trudging down one of the rocks slops, getting his toe holds and sticks set for descent. Bonnie is close by and Jeff too. They are doing great and we settle in behind them for our last mile down. Larry goes on ahead and we never see any more of him. Sure hope he hasn’t taken a wrong turn. That’s how he got his first trail name our know, Left Turn Leon. He could have missed a blaze no other paths to turn onto. Hope he didn’t slip off a rock? Jeff assures me ol Larry is setting up in the back of the explorer chillin with a beer. See my stick I hid when I broke it is gone. Bonnie checks the log they hid it behind and it is in fact gone. Hatch up, wet shirt hanging on the car door window. Yep he’s not lost he is right where he wanted to be to start with. Gather around folks, cheers to a good day with the Dragon and friends.

Larry turns back over to catch a few more winks while I prepare my pack and fix our breakfast. This may be a lonewolf hike today I think to myself. Ah but thankfully there’s a birthday party and cake over in Giles County, Larry won’t miss that. It’s The Captain’s 70th and a celebration has been planned. I picked the Cascades for a nice easy hike prior to the party. Now I just need to get me some hikers. Pulling into the parking lot we are 1 of 3 other cars here. “See told ya there would be no one here Larry states”, yawning and pulling out his $3 to get us in. Cold air rushing in the car as I get out to fill out our parking permit, snow dusting the ground and falling lightly from the sky. Perfect if you ask me.It can be bitter in this holler but hasn’t quite gotten to that yet this morning but we do put on wool hats and gloves it is winter ya know. Foot prints lead before us until the first bridge of the lower trail which we always take up. It runs along the water’s edge and is a better walk up than down with wet rocks. Four people have gone to this point and turned around to head back to their car, that was them we met just coming out as we came in. I wonder how soon they had arrived to already be finishing. Well they missed the best part, the falls. “See no one is out today. See I’m doing better than 90% of Giles County” L-Train rolls at his leisurely pace. No need in breaking a sweat. I feel like I’m hardly moving and he still isn’t up with me. I’ll stop and take something off so he’ll catch up and not feel like I am pushing him. “smile” The boiler from the logging mill gives us a chance to shed a layer and watch the water rush over the large rocks in the creek. It’s quite loud and we have to shout at one another to hear if not close. Come on LT let’s get that train moving. Rock steps and powder covered trail make for peaceful walk otherwise. Not big groups of people coming and going today. Only our footprints all the way to the falls. Pointing to Barneys Wall, way up above us, I show where I could hike today but will forgo its summit since just the two of us. No way this train will pull that off and our later start would have me running to get it in and that’s no fun. I will settle in for doing what I love with the man I love even though he IS driving me crazy loafing around back there. “smile” I draw a heart in the snow, LT.Icicles form on all branches close to the creek. I hear the falls roar it just around the next bend. And boy does she deliver. Seeing it more than a dozen times it never gets old. She’ not frozen over but does have some nice ice formations around. We do notice the forest service has cut more brush and rolled it down into the water’s edge beside the newest rock walk way. This will insure no more washouts and keep this rock structure from breaking down. It’s not often we are the first to arrive and we enjoy every minute and I do mean minute. It doesn’t take long to get chilled here with the over spay rolling over us. We return back from the way we came electing not to go up the high side to that access to the fire road. Instead we walk back along the creek and then hit the side path to the fire road down. Saved a few steps and gave us a different perspective for a change. Larry checks the time and say’s if we walk 3 miles an hour we’ll be back to the car by 11:30.” Ha! You think you can walk that fast? It’s downhill ya know?” I poke. “I’m fast, fast as lightnen” Choo Choo. The train continues it chug-a-lug pace. Hearing some voice we aren’t the only ones now. The parking lot has a few more cars and more coming in. It’s just shy of noon. And another snow squall rolls in to close out our day as it started it. Glad we had this place to ourselves if only for a little while now let’s go and eat some of Captains Cake!","Dragon's Tooth- Newport Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554553,"When I asked Bonnie if she had any preference for hikes today I got a stern “something flat, no climbing/hills, not too long and close by”. Well at least I delivered 1 out of the 4. I knew the winds were supposed to kick up by afternoon and the earlier we could get to walking the better so I picked Kelly’s Knob. Yes I have to get a climb in some way and hey it isn’t too long but far from flat except the 100 yard walk at the very first thru the field where the footbridge has been built do to some active beavers damming up the little creek. A warm morning with overcast skies has us in shorts but with back up layers in tow just in case. Never been on a ridge that the wind didn’t blow somewhat this time of year. We have the trail to ourselves, not a sole parked. Cresting the first little hump more field walk with tall flowing grass parted with a wide mowed trail way. Thank you maintainers for this. It will become a haven for ticks in the heat of the summer. Light winds roll over us laying the grass over gently as if it is waving us onward. Reach the woods calmness settles in and the only thing blowing is our chatter between us.An hours walk has us passing the old spot of the Blair witch house… completely torn down and dismantled you’d never know there used to be a large old farmhouse here. I miss it even though it did have an aura of spookiness to it with the tared black hand prints stepped all over the walls and floors, even some on the ceiling in places. I’m sure many a hiker and hunter had camped in it but lighting hit and it went downhill from there. The shelter is just up the way after we cross Laurel Creek a few times. Bonnie recalls it being much higher and having to rock up more so than today. We both still take care not to slip and get wet. I joke that this is nothing, wait till we have some of those fords in Maine to contend with. Bonnie is out, no way. Time to climb. Kelly has a pretty good workout awaiting us. We know it. Recalling our first attempt some years ago. My dad, Janet, Bonnie and myself all set out to climb Kelly’s Knob and with snow on. Yep a good 6 to 8 inches that sunny day. Every step we tried going forward we slide 2 steps back. The sun was melting the snow and making it a slick track. When we finally crested the knob we were all a sweaty mess and declared this was Kelly’s Knob. We never found a sign noting so but we declared it. After some research and a few more trips up this mountain I did discover the sign marking the side path to the actual overlook of Kelly’s knob and it was only a 5 minutes’ walk from our stopping point that first day.Bonnie instructs me to go on and she’ll see me at the top. Heading on out at my pace I already plan to stop at our ‘spot’ for old time sake and wait on my hiking friend. She is a dear blessing willing to go just about wherever I lead. Legs feeling stronger each week after some gym workouts in preparation for our big trip. I have a long way to go to be Maine ready but progress it good. Looking up to the top I look even higher recalling the daunting boulder scrambles of NH and that this has no comparison. Quite thankful it isn’t but know deep down I need to find such a training ground and get to it. Winds greet me at the top. Wew need that other longsleeve on while waiting on Bonnie who is just 15 minutes behind me. This is our spot I point out. See that slight path over to the edge, this is where we crashed girl. No snow ball fights today but we did catch small dusting of snow down between the trees downed over the trail. Speaking of which man were that lots of blow downs. A good 10 tens down at the shelter area and several on our way up here.Kelly’s Knob View 20 yds…it’s the official sign. Blue blazes lead you to the rocks of the knob. You can rock hop like hopscotch if you choose over the many pillars but take care and not miss hop or you have a long way down between these crevasses. Not feeling the need to experience this take our photos and we nestle close to safer ground and have our lunch. Wool hats and jackets on to help enjoy our stop. Here comes that wind. Gust come and go keeping our stay to a minimal. My hands are cold glad we both had gloves handy. I wish I’d had a kite for the fun of it. We might have taken flight.Cruising off the mountain the winds lay before us as tree and land protect. Look a splash of blue sky but it quickly rolls over with clouds. We make a quick pit stop at the shelter curious of the destruction. I notice how open it had looked over this way when we pasted by and now I can really count the trees down. Workers have cut to remove dangerously propped trees but have loads of wood to cut yet. I scan the journal to see if recognize any trail names but don’t on this look so I leave our mark and off we go.Several little groups of day hikers are met on our way out. Suspecting college students looking to climb the knob. Say are we there yet? Both groups not even half way. When I inform them it’s a 7.4 mile round trip, eye open wide and some even say let’s turn around. None have much in the way of preparation, water, jackets, hats. They discuss amongst themselves as we rejoice in ending of our trek retreating from the winds that have really kicked up now. That lovely field of flowing grass is now a whirlwind of blades. Hang on to your hat Bonnie. Glad this gals has some meat on my bones our I’d be light of foot. Hope our fellow hikers are doing ok out there. Our parking area now is full of cars. It’s been another good hike on Kelly’s knob.","The Cascades

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554937,"A Big group’s going on the hike today. The more the merrier, now where is Kelly? We are all waiting at Craig’s Creek Road and no Kelly. Wind whips down the roadway like a wind tunnel. Damn hope this doesn’t hang around all day. I text and leave a phone message in hopes to reach her. Let’s load up gang and head out.We are taking my car and John’s to support our shuttle between trail ends. I have Carolann, Anna and TJ aboard now. And then it hits me…maybe Kelly drove down to where the trail crosses and is waiting there. Pulling into the parking area to leave my car a SUV is there but no Kelly…then a car wheels in with Connecticut tags. Bing Bing Bing that’s her. She had been waiting here all along and gave up on us but saw my car coming down the road and turned around. Good girl. Places everyone, TJ tighties himself amongst the packs in the hatch and John takes us down to Trout Creek. I prepare him for what might be a creek crossing and I don’t mean over a bridge. I’ve driven through the creek on my first drive over here not knowing if the labeled private bridge was allowed for use much less would it hold. It still rattles and rumbles as we cross.A short dirt road drive meandering along with the creek we come to the trail crossing. Time to pick up where you left off Kelly. Dragon’s Tooth was that way and we’ll hike back this way over some new ground for you and Carolann. City Slicka already has my loaner sticks for her torn down, stretched apart till I can get some adjustment on them so they can be of use. It’s all up and then all down I say when asked about our hike. Carolann jumps in to hike behind me with her sticks ready for digging in. Our peloton is in motion. Hardly up the first grade Slicka is already sliding back. “You’re walking to fast, dammit” The group changes up spots and she is relegated close to the sweeper position. I joke with my front team this will work out just fine, we’ll still be well within earshot but not blasted out. “Just keep hiking John tells Carolann. Each stop will only be 30 seconds and that starts when Martha stops. Then we reach her she’ll take off again.” It’s a sad game I play. Switchbacks and a graded trail make this side of the mountain a pretty fair climb. It will be a much steeper and more direct down on our decent I inform. Wind in some calmer and we all breakout of any extra clothes. Most of us already in shorts we have depended on the weatherman’s forecast of 70s. Heavy clouds continue to keep thing dreary looking but there is a peek of blue skies now and then. The shadows they cast on the ridges make for glorious views.“Where’s the top?” Carolann’s voice pierces thru the woods. After each turn of the trail around this mountain it does seem like we should be cresting soon. Be thankful for such good trail, this is a blessing TJ conveys. We could be climbing boulders. The trail widens a bit and I notice we have reached the forest road which means we are on the top. See there’s the flag!! The girls think I’m joking but I point thru the trees and old glory is flying on the knoll where the monument sets.Audie Murphy’s Monument, a granite salute to his valor in WWII. He lost his life in a plane crash on this very mountain in 1971.Audie Leon Murphy the most decorated American combat soldier of World War II, receiving every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.More stones have been stacked beside the monument forming a cairn in equal height. Mementoes left from others, flags, dog tags, patches, flowers. It changes with every visit but they all are left for the same reasons, honor, respect, loss and remembrance. We thank him and our soldiers.Lunch brings out all kinds of goodies today. John has gone daily double from Hardees downing his second chicken biscuit of the day while Kelly goes good for ya with her super bag of baby carrots. Carolann has a sub from Walmart that weighs most of her pack and I pay tribute to our missing hiker Hunter by eating a can of beanie weanies. Cheers as I drink the juices down to the last sip. Anna and TJ munch on a variety of snacks. You ever had siracha flavored almonds? Well they are great. Hey I have a homemade fried apple pie too. Bites around. Before we leave let’s take in one more site a top Brush Mountain. A small overlook sets off the back of this knoll with a nice view but is quite cold as it sets on the north side. Wind and shade make for a quick stop. A soldier is honored here, boots, tags and a photo in his memory. I’m sure this newly placed bench will allow some great reflection by many who come to visit. Bolting back to the sunshine we are set to hike off. Clouds have parted and blue skies abound. A plane is heard from way above. We can’t find it but can hear it. Audie is that you? Harry? Just about every time I’m here a plane has flown over. A rush of cold air then warm, a ghost….We make quick time off this steep side. Switchbacks come to bottom land and the dried up streams. No snow and really not that much rain has all the footbridges over once full streams seem useless. This mountain runs dry. Beware thru hikers. Can you hear that Carolann? Cars, it’s the road. Once again the woods fill with her sound. What’s on ahead Kelly asks? Another ridge just like this one. It’s all up and then all down just follow those white blazes.","Trout Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555262,"Up and at’em time to roll L-Train. “We’re burning daylight” as one of his favorite western actors told his cowboys. We’re off to follow the yellow blazes of Andy Lane trail which will connect us up with the AT. Yellow Blazin = any method of NON foot travel along the AT without walking the white blazes. Frowned up in by book but if Larry were to know of this “good fortune” he might go more often. Come on grab those sticks and get the hat and gloves on. The wind swirls around us in the parking lot. We are one of just a few cars. Clear skies have made for a cold, almost spring, morning. The plan is to hike up this side trail 3 miles and connect to the AT and explore Tinker Mountain. Been here many times and am looking forward to sharing it again with Larry. Has been some time since he walked this and I am hoping his memory doesn’t come back too soon to spoil his trip. All up from here…shuuuush…don’t tell him.Land reclamations have been put along the stream that the trail used to run beside. Once we top that first little woods walk we now open up to a large pasture field with hundreds of waste high tubes with small saplings inside. This will save this bottom land from flooding and provide new growth along the stream. The large footbridge adds a nice touch for crossing Tinker Creek which by the way is quite low due to a dry winter. A hard packed trail turns up from our only flat walking of the day unless you wanna count the cliffs!Waiting at a small gate while taking off my gloves and stalling a bit I can see the L-train is chugging along and I don’t mean on cold one. He has already come out of his jacket and is sweating up a storm. Two more challenging pulls are up ahead and I’m figuring a bow out is coming soon on his part. Steep grade calls for granny low. Push off those sticks and dig with those legs. I need a good 2 miles of just this over and over to prepare for more Maine miles I think to myself. I’m sure Larry is thinking what the heck am I doing here when I could be playing golf. I try to make small talk to help distract him but while talking and hiking I realize I am chatting only to myself when I crest the first hill. Trudging toward me I see a good bye coming and I surrender him to his pace and he begs me to carry on with mine. Please Please go he says. I’ll keep walking forward till you come back my way and we’ll walk back together Larry instructs. A day hiker had just pasted us and I am already thinking that I can catch him in the switchbacks. After tackling that next grade I shout back to Larry and disappear from his view…I’m off.Settling in to my stride the switchbacks make this mountain climb quite nice and for Larry will be bearable if he can just get past that last hard hill. I hoping he’ll make it to Scorched Earth, the junction from yellow blazes to white. Hey are you geocaching I shout out to the day hiker I have now caught up to. He is off trail and up on a rocky area above me looking around like he has lost something. Yes he replies and wonders if I know of “the” location. Oh no I’m just a hiker enjoy your search.I meet a few more early birds already returning from the cliffs and by the car count figure I will have it to myself. Leaving a note at Scorched Earth trail signs I hope Larry will see that I have passed here and know about when I’ll be catching back up to him. Feeling the sweat I’ve worked up turn cold with the breezes I figure I’d better get my wool hat back out before turning the corner on the cliffs. Wind rushes thru the valley below me as I step on the first rock. Three large birds float at eye level feeling free in the air as do I. Keeping a sure foot I follow the white blazes running along the edge in and out of the cliffs for a half mile. McAfee knob stands tall above the valley in my southerly view. Working with my new phone and new small tripod I take many photos and videos to share and capture another memory. It doesn’t take long before the hands are cold and the notion I should go find Larry hits. I’ll be back I say out loud to those birds. Oh and you smiling little daffodils, you keep popping up for the rest to see. Yes can you believe it? Daffodils on top of Tinker Cliffs. 10:53 was my time at the junction, it’s 11:56 now. Wow I did stay up here a while. Getting a quicker pace on the ½ mile back to the Scorched Earth I ask folks on their hike up if they have seen my man. “You must be Larry’s wife” a couple asked. They had talked with him for a while and relayed the message he was on his way back to the parking lot. HA he did make it most of the way up. They wish me good luck on my big trip…wow they did talk to Larry for a while I ponder. 12:06 I pick up my note, leave no trace and am on a mission to see how quick I can run down that train. More hikers and more dogs but no Larry yet. Switchbacks…hootie hoot. I see his orange shirt run between trees below. I see you but you can’t see me. Hootie Hoo…”where have you been?!” I’ve been waiting for an hour he says….Uhmmm hiiikking??? I say. I did get caught up in “my time” on the cliffs and knew you’d be on along and wellll you did make it to the junction, right? That’s a good thing. Say listen to those birds? Aren’t they beautiful? “I can hear those birds from our living room window in my recliner” he says with a half ass grin. Can see from there too! Ha but you can’t get this kind of exercise in that recliner though. A happy couple we are.He tells me of his trip up and how after these dang steep parts we are now going back down it wasn’t too bad. Knee pounding down and we are back to that very gate from this morning. Smooth sailing he smiles. I’ll be eating at Ironto shortly he states. Uhh don’t forget that last little hill before the parking lot, I say. Disputing this fact he declares he’ll just tent right here. Wish I had brought one and held him to that statement. Come on you yellow blazer….P.S. We had a wonder meal at the Italian Kitchen. Larry polished our day with a piece of German chocolate cake which I did get two bites of before he took my spoon.","Audie Murphy Monument, Rt. 621

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555699,"I’m totally on my own schedule today. No followers in this pack. Just me. Lonewolfin. As I pull into the Daleville park-n-ride I wonder how many cars are for hikers. I park in the area which usually means “going for a hike” and ready myself. Sun is full on and a crisp bite of frost is in the air. Walking up the side path my mind already begins to wander….I notice a branched off path in the grass which cuts off to the Holiday Inn Express. A hikers haven when they’ve hiked north from Pearisburg to here, one of their longest stretches without a food resupply option due little road crossings. I can see this swimming pool full of hikers come summer soaking off trail dust from their dirty tired bodies. A new kiosk has been built at the trail junction with the AT and my side trail. I’m sure it will host a load of town info and trail summary for this area. The iron gate at the cement bridge has been partially removed for easier pass thru. No more having to crawl under of over. Extra logs have been cut in half and made into bog walks in a few spots. I practice my balance on these even though the trail on both sides is bone dry, dirt. There will be plenty of these bog walks come Maine and the step offs can be quite nasty and deep. A miss step could leave you without a shoe or worse.Maintainers have been hard at work re-routing this trail from few years ago from a ‘holler walk’ to a more graded switchback approach. This path is used a lot since it is wide and hard packed raw dirt. I make quick time of it.Reaching the crest I hear voices which does surprise me this early in the day. Nice to know these young folks are out taking in nature. I don’t pause at this overlook a little to “in town” yet for me. Powerlines buzz with electricity pumping through them to the town below. Two more overlooks are just out from this location and they don’t disappoint. Carvin’s Cove setting full as I can tell. Its branches of water stretch out like fingers into the various cuts. Calm and peaceful. High winds have littered the trail with blow downs. Black pines snapped and crumbled. More trail work has been done to cut and clear the path but new work lies in places. Most of the trail is now exposed and open. I can see Botetourt to my right and the cove to my left. My hands are full.A trail runner approaches…I have to think now of Jim and how he is transforming from a hiker to a trail runner too, covering big miles in a days’ time. Feet lightly stepping from rock to rock, quick at the pace, hello and goodbye in one breath. Cool breezes keep me from really sweating but there are still a few ups and down of rock scramble that have the legs working for good measure. I run up on a stopped thru-hiker. Seeing his big pack and AT registration tag gives him away. Stopping to talk I learn he is from NJ and has started from Daleville this morning too. He is staying with Woods Hole Hostel and working on completing his thru hike. He came off the trial in Oct after some burn out and some family events, daughter’s wedding, and has been wanting to get back out to finish what he started. He clipped 1500 miles yesterday after doing a prelim day hike or two to get back in the swing of things. He’s loaded for bear and dripping sweat. Giving my encouragement I leave him to head on to Hay Rock knowing we will have another chance to chat there too. Old Bull, you have some grand overlooks ahead of you, Tinker Cliffs, McAfee, Dragon’s Tooth. He waves goodbye and says he is slow…that’s slow Old Bull…SOB for short and we both have a laugh.I envy his next few days of hiking wishing I was doing the same. I’ve seen them all but doing this stretch in a long weekend would be wonderful. Keep your calendar open folks; it will be in the future. Surprisingly I’ve already reached Hay Rock. I recognize the preceding rock scramble and wait to pull out my phone for a video till I’m down safely and can walk and film at the same time. Large rock slabs hang over the trail shading all sun. I’m sure many have clambered all up on these but I’ll stay close to the ground and find my lunch spot to enjoy the view. Old Blue comes on along and we have that next chat. He appreciates the section hikers for our dedication to the trail. Walking many miles over and over is not is wish. Every step for him is new blaze. LASHer he has become now. That’s Long Ass Section Hiker. Which I shall turn back into come July. “You have a grand stretch ahead my friend, good luck to you!” Stop in and see the Captain when we come back into Pearisburg. He does recall his place. A fist bump so long and maybe our paths will cross again. Soaking up the sun, eating my hot soup, overlooking Carvin’s Cove, it don’t get no better than this. I could camp right here if I had my tent. Wonder where Old Bull will camp for the night? Hopefully just shy of the cliffs and then he can see the sun rise from them in the morning. Hopefully it will not be as windy as I experienced just last weekend. Gathering up my things it’s time to return back from which I came. This part always passes quickly. I remember each distinction, a turn in the trail, a tree crossed, an overlook, a trail sign, the buzzing powerlines. Only an hour back to the car now, maybe less going down.A few hikers are starting their day as I am finishing mine. Be sure to go on out to Hay Rock I instruct. Trust this section hiker you won’t be disappointed.","Daleville

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557008,"Back at Hay Rock….Who says repeating the same miles isn’t fun. All of my training hikes are repeat miles. Shoot if I counted all my repeat blazes I’d have the AT hiked twice over. I love going back to places and taking others who haven’t been there like today. Bonnie says she has seen Hay Rock so we are going to say Hey…Rock. We crack ourselves up.A warm day is in store but for right now its darn cold. A clear night with some rain has moisture in the air making it feel colder that it really is. We have layers on expecting to come out of them hopefully. Taking the short connector path to the AT I give Bonnie directions of north and south and show her the party pad, Holiday Inn Express just off the trail. An easy stop in for a tired hiker and hey they have pool!!! Pizza Hut is just across the road too.That kiosk I saw in the last 2 weeks is now uncovered and has some local mapping and rules for the area. No alcohol on the trail allowed between 220 and 311. Hummm wonder why this area is so important.New spring growth as already come along over the last few weeks. Green leaves sprout from all the bushes and vines. Birds are tweeting, spring is in the air. Crossing the railroad tracks it is time to begin the climb to the powerlines and that easy ridge walk I’ve been playing up to Bonnie. She has already said she’s expected the worse. Always does when hiking with Martha she says.Switchbacks and wide path allow us to talk up freely without getting out of breath. New Hampshire is still on my mind and Bonnie has already expressed interest in going back with me to truly enjoy those mountains and hike hut to hut and live it up in the wild. HA Still cautious she asks questions of what ifs making to huts and camping options, water and food. I’ll make it as easy as I can, we’ll be on vacation. Time to shed some clothing. Bonnie has already ditched some of her pack weight taking out rain pants and an extra jacket at the car. She is learning if you don’t need it don’t carry it. Shoot she was counting sticks of gum this morning before packing and only brought 3 instead of full pack. Jimmy would be proud…grams baby. They all count.Shorts and tshirts, we are climb ready. Powerline buzz, are we here already? We can see the Pizza Hut roof and the area of our parked car. No other hikers up here today. We have the trail to ourselves.Carvins Cove is just over this next hill. McAfee can be seen off in the distance. Ridge time, easy walking. Just a few very short rock scrambles. We are caught up in our conversation when a trailrunner comes up from behind and tries to warn us but we didn’t hear her till she was right on Bonnie’s heals. She speaks and we jump out of our skin. Shit, where did she come from? Having a good laugh we give her a thumbs up and give her the right of way.Hey is that Hay Rock? Heck that didn’t take long. Bonnie is surprised we made it here so soon. Walking under its overhang we area shadowed out from the sun and feel quite small. Let’s get a photo with us acting like we are holding this up I say. Ha, Bonnie laughs, I’ll go take a nap while you get that new phone tripod set up. Yes I’ve had some technical difficulty with my new device. The company is sending me a new one so hopefully it doesn’t prove operator error. Two hikers come from each direction. One from local out on a two day hike coming from McAfee and the other from Hampton Rhodes. His pack was a big as him. A short, young lad, stout looking, a navy man. He’s training for the PCT he says. This AT is kicking my ass. He tried some 15 mile days and was wiped out. In good spirits and excited just to be here we wish him good luck. Lunch looking over the cove again was nice. We are only snacking, we have Ironto’s Italian to look forward to. Them fellas of ours are missing out we say. Working our way back clouds are starting to come over and that nice blue sky is now gone. Glad we got those photos earlier. More hikers are coming in now. Some only going to the powerline area and to the first sighting of the cove. We encourage all to trek on out. It’s well worth the extra hour’s walk to say Hey.","Daleville

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557792,"Being close to home was nice today. No interstate, just a quick drive in the country finding those blazes crossing the road. Parking at our normal spot in a median area between two roads so not to have any run-ins with Nascar lady. A car or 2 are already here, one from South Dakota. Most cars here will be hiking to Kelly’s Knob to opposite direction of our hike today, Sinking Creek Mtn, and the Keffer Oak.A warm day is in store, mostly cloudy which will make for perfect hiking since it’s all up from here. It’s shorts season and boy am I ready for it. Very tall field grass sways with the slight breeze. Bonnie you back there? Can hardly see here for it all. Up the field we go for a quick leg burn and warm up. There are two of these humps before we reach the big ol oak. She is as awesome as usual. Towering around us she holds our attention. In this sway of the fields and backed up close to a fence line and the woods she remains protected from all those harsh winds. Only a few branches ever broken from this beast. We gather up under her trunk for a different vantage point for a photo. I have so many. We notice a small fire ring close by once used and flat area for a tent or two. Time to climb. We have 1200 feet of elevation to get in the next 1.3 miles. Now that’s a good work out. Bonnie settles into her pace and I settle to mine. Switchbacks do help and we both are thankful for them. I do notice some pink ribbons marking a cut off from one of the turns to cut out a very steep area. Guess the trail crew will be back to make this become trail soon.There’s the top Bonnie, I love when you can look up and see the top. I keep referring and comparing back to those NH climbs and there is no comparison that I have found yet. Hut to hut in 2020. That my and Bonnie’s plan. Come join us for a vacation in the Whites. See 6 out of 8 huts in 8 hiking days. Every day under 8 miles. Dinner, Bed and Breakfast. Say Bonnie can you can you carry this case for me?Cresting Sinking Creek Mountain we take a toast of Gatorade and head on out for Sarver. Not going to go down to the shelter or ruins. Have a birthday party to get back for. Homeplace, country cooking and good friends. Can’t wait. Happy birthday FarmBoy. (that’s Bonnie’s husbands handle, Jeff).A hiker comes up quickly from behind. He is a local out for a quick trek before he has to go to work. He turns around at the powerlines but first takes in a wonderful view over the valley. Rock cairns from old man Sarver’s time remain along a section called the orchard. It really was an orchard area, you can see the old apple trees and grape vines. We settle in for lunch just off the trail on a nice large log. Good day ladies. A hiker approaches. He is from Ohio and off to Maine. Started Feb 14th and looks happy to be where he is. He notices my patches on my pack and asks if we have hike the whole trail and of course I fill him in. He is thrilled to know of what lies ahead and promises to slow down in the whites. Good day Stamps and happy trails.Testing out a new flavored of tuna, thai chili, it hits the spot. Good thing cause I’ve allotted a few of these for our upcoming big trip. Wish I could carry these little oranges too. A healthy lunch and we are off again.Strolling along we hear a large group coming this way. College kids. Hey where ya’ll headed? Kelly’s Knob the gal says. Uhh you do know that the other way? I say. The pack of 6 others are lost for words except for I told ya so. And we can’t turn back now….No worries fella’s you have much to explore this way. Sarver Holler, the ruins, a cemetery, history my friends. Say is that a box of Carolee’s donuts? Yes ma’am we plan to have a picnic. They have music playing as we speak. The pack moves on and I sorta wished I’d asked for one of those sweet circles of goodness for those directions. They are the best in all of the New River Valley.Down Down back over those switchbacks, crossing those fields and recalling our visit with Topper. Oh the fields are filled wiiith thhhe soouund of muuuusiiic. And there you have it the Keffer Oak. So long till next time.Reaching the road we see more cars in our area parked and some along the road. A fellow asked if we have seen any thru hikers. He is disappointed he missed Stamps. He takes notes of all he has met. Over 5000 I think he said. Oh and hey is that Sharon Jean? Lord have mercy it’s an old friend from many occasion Bonnie and I both know. We have hiked together, Woman With Many Coats, I called her. We have gone to aerobics together and the gym. So good to see her again. We talked for an hour. We’ll, Larry, Man of many words, did most of the talking. He is a Larry too, Larry Workman. I think I’ll call him Larry Talkman. Ah this trail does bring out many, old friends and new.

A loop hike with fields, overlooks, ups and downs, way downs and way ups, streams and hardwoods, rocks and boulders, fire roads and bridges. It’s the perfect training ground. Come along with us and find out. It will kick your arss right when you think you have it whipped. Just ask Anna.Excited to head back to this trail we meet up at Riner Food Center to carpool. Good to see Anna and TJ again. Been awhile since we last hiked together. They each have their packs which is good thing. Sometimes TJ will be the gentleman and carry all they need for the day but when the big trip comes the load will need to be shared. Time to get those trail legs back with a pack.Stepping out of the car along the parkway at Rocky Knob not a breeze stirs. Can’t believe it. No wind? Sunny spring day. Let’s warm up the legs by heading up the field instead of going down into the gorge right off. I’ll save that little pleasure for later I think to myself.Deer peep up over the ridge watching us make our way closer to them and the crest. The large oak that stands tall above the thorny bushes marks a perfect picture spot looking back over Floyd VA. We trek alongside the parkway checking out the overlooks peering off into the gorge we will soon climb down into and out of. Floydfest stages and grounds are our last sights before turning down into the gorge. Creek side trail now that will twist its way around the depths of the surrounding mountains. Only a few blow downs to navigate on this side. Arriving at the Rock Castle we stand small with this boulder field. Ok Anna just pick a path and start climbing up that mess and that’s NH trail. Oh and add more height to it TJ says. Snake havens and bear’s dens are talked about as we pass thru. It’s only a short section but could give pause middle of a hot summer day. Rattlers…Reaching our lunch bench we can hear the water roar just below. Glad that big bridge is there for passing over. We heard a lot of trail work has been done over the past year. Flooding had closed the trail. Testing out some trail food ideas for our lunch today that we might take on long trip is always fun. Wish this fruit would travel along. White chocolate peanut butter sandwiches, chili Thai tuna, kids ice granola bars, hotwing flavors pretzels, siracha flavored almonds. We washed it all down with Gatorade. Say let’s suggest there be Gatorade and cold beer stations. I think we could make it then.After lunch we stop by the old chimney that stands right alongside the trail. Can’t tell it has faltered at all ever since I’ve been hiking over here. Crossing that nice bridge the half way sign say 5.6 back to the car. Enjoy this fire road of easy walk cause shits about to hit the fan in a few miles. Maintenance workers have put in 3 new big bridges on the fire road down. Water runoff from the mountain had several areas washed out and they have now diverted rock and earth to help prevent this again. Adding the bridges will keep feet dry and allow easier motor passage if need be. Meeting a few other hikers now I know we are closing in on the lower gorge parking area. Get ready to shed that vest Anna. Time to sweat. Our hips are tightening up from all this down and need a change of terrain. Be careful what you ask for. 3 miles of up is now in store.Getting our last bit of Gatorade and gumption we step from fire road to trail. Steady pace I’m feeling pretty good. Sticks are helping with forward motion. Kids have elected to go without and I think it will catch up with him now. Parts of the trail have nothing but your legs to drive you up the slope and sticks help me dig in. This tractor can’t get no traction without. I peek back over my shoulder from time to time and see some distance widening between us. Anna gives a puff and blow of exhaustion and we take a break in the shade of the rhododendrons. Dang this 3 miles is a killer. Is all the miles like this? No but we do have those rocks to get thru first. Crap. I’ll just go back to that parking lot we just passed. Haha You sound like some others I know…Harry…Bonnie…Step rock, step rock, dig, climb, shit it’s hot. I reach the turn of the trail that I’m familiar with that leads to salvation. Taking a break while fixing a war wound from a darn stick that has cut my leg I hear TJ encouraging Anna to press on. No passing out with this outfit. Feeling the heart beat in her head she knows she’s pushed her limits and takes in some water and aids in my nursing attempt. You’ve about got this whipped girl. Hearing the parkway traffic over the next mile Anna’s looking for the lift out. Say can’t we just cut up thru there and catch a ride? Then you’d miss this remaining peaceful beautiful walk. Moss lines our path, fresh and green. Ground cedar’s carpet inviting us to lie down in. Oh that grassy area we are parked in calls us. How far, how far? See there, that’s the field this adventure all started in, we are here just a few steps away. Packs drop and so do bodies. Oh this grass feels good. TJ stretches his legs while Anna looks to the sky flat of her back and says “I made it! That gorge almost killed me but I made it!” Once again the Gorge has provided it’s full range of it all.","Rock Castle Gorge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562587,"Keep your eye peeled Bonnie that double blue blaze is here somewhere. Stony Creek rolls full to our left and Peter’s Mountain looms to our right. Now to just find the trail head. We’ve drop a hike to car down the way at Cherokee Flats. Never saw a blue mark on the powerline pole on the way in but know pretty close where it might be. With all of spring time blooming the forest ground cover is thick, sure hoping this side trail isn’t a bushwhacking event today.
There, there are the marks let’s pull over at this nice fisherman’s parking spot. Bonnie looks perplexed. There’s no path Martha! I don’t see a trail. No worries gal there should be a path once we cut through this undergrowth. If we don’t find a blaze we’ll just go on down to the kiosk and hike in.  

Wisteria hangs full from the various trees. A lovely sweet smell. Gonna be a blue bird day. Come on gal let’s get to it. 

She has come prepared. Water shoes in case our creek crossings later are full and rock hoping not an option, rain jacket in case an afternoon thunderstorm comes in. Food sack for a proper lunch along with 2 gatorades.  Bug, tick, sunscreen lotion.  All of which I am carrying. Time to turn up the wick and fill that pack for a real like backpacking trip. Train for Maine!

Loaded with more than a day hiker would carry I’m up for the challenge. Bonnie’s right on my heels.  Blue blazes are in pretty good shape for following. A maintainer has been thru here, blow down cut and ground briars have been trimmed. I know this area is good hunting ground for turkey. Been here seen that. 

One and half miles to the top Bonnie. We are about half way. The switchbacks are over. Straight up the gut.  Sun burns thru the woods. Thanks to some gusts of wind we aren’t totally turning to sweat. 

Seeing the ridge line I shout back “almost there”.  Big red rock. White blazes. Now this is THE trail.  The forest service has painted this large triangled rock for a marker for the junction. No trail sign here. It’s pretty faded and figured easier to climb up this trail and connect than walk the AT ridge and possibly miss this and turn a 9 mile day to 20. 

I test Bonnie directional skills and quiz her on which way we should hike now….with a look each way she give the correct answer and off toward Captain’s we go. It’s all ridge line walk… uh but don’t let that fool ya. Ridges have Ups.  Stone hinge awaits.  

Naming this area for its large truck sized boulders I begin counting them as we hike UP the grade. After 7 my mind wanders and Bonnie fades out of sight. 

Taking a break at the crest time to lighten this load and drink some Gatorade. Red faced  but smiling Bonnie comes along for her break. 

Grass begins to line the trail, an inviting walk. We meet a several hikers. One a recently finished SOBO giving out beer from his back pack. It was a small pack so guessing there wasn’t a case in there. Taking the last drag from his cigarette we part ways. 

Coming to our next junction, the Alleghany Trail, time for lunch. This yellow blazed trail’s southern terminus is at the top of Peter’s mtn in conjunction with the AT. Sign say 12.7 to Waitville Road. Time to hike this next trip Bonnie. You in? We have to count the 2.5 miles of AT from Pine swamp to our day…doable she agrees. 

A strong breeze makes lunch a cooling off time. A trail runner flies by. She’s a long tall Sally. Jim you needed to catch this. Gone in a blink. 

Time now to start our signage monitoring. ATC has been notifying hikers that Pine Swamp shelter is closed due to chance of dead tree fall. Signs are posted before and after the shelter and a few others along the way. Seeing an area just ahead for camping and a fire ring left I figure a sign might be handy here. Would let those hiking north know shelter is closed and if they are tired they might pull up here instead.  No sooner than we begin our work two thru-hikers come along and say they have heard and planning to go on to Bailey’s Gap shelter. Guthooks, a trail guide website has the info posted. Good deal. Don’t forget to hit the Captain’s zipline and grab a soda. They have that on their agenda already. Say we might see ya there too. Happy trails.

The ascent off Peter’s Mountain was full of summertime sweets. Wild iris, tiny and purple, dandelions, and yummy teaberry. Reaching the bottom the creeks are full but very passable. No water shoes needed, just a stead step. All signs are posted along our way and we read in the shelter log that now hikers are going on down the way and heeding the warnings. 

Walking along Stony Creek the trail teases us and put some darn ups along the way away from the water’s edge. Captain’s sign tacked to a tree points ahead. His zipline is open since the last hard rains closed it. He is always keeping the hikers safe from high water times.  The path to the line is a fully warn trail now. Bonnie and I think it’s time for some trail maintenance here. Darn steep coming down the bank to the water. Hopefully we can get our fellas to help with this project. 

The hikers we previously met are still here. They wave as we zip across to this little piece of heaven. Cold sodas, lush green yard calling a weary sole to rest. A few more guys come in and all agree this is the place for them tonight. Bailey’s gap can wait till tomorrow. 

Happy trails again fellas, this train has another mile to walk to reach our car and call it a day.","Dickinson Gap side trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563685,"I’ve always wanted to hike this North Mountain Trail. Been looking at this trail on my AT map for years… says 10.4 miles. Heard it was the old route of the AT. No water up there they said. Good ridge walk. So let’s go check it out I say to my trusted hiking friend Bonnie.

 
Since we have some drive time between car drops decided to get that out of the way this morning. So we drive down to Andy Lane Trailhead and leave Bonnie’s car. She’s still a little fuzzy on exactly what we are hiking today. It’s all new trail Bon, trust me we will be coming back to this very spot when we finish, but not by way of any white blazes. Still unsure she leaves her car and jumps in with me off to park at Dragon’s Tooth ‘real’ parking lot.   
 
Here is where it all began folks. Dragon’s Tooth parking lot. My first ever hike on the Appalachian Trail. It was 2002 I believe. White Blazes? Where do they go? How do I get a map about this trail? It took one hike and I knew I needed to discover more. 5000 miles later I’m still discovering.
 
Loaded with extra in my ULA pack I want to get the leg burn today of carrying a full pack. I have 2 tents, poles, sleeping mat, some day gear and some of Bonnie’s gear. I’ll lighten her load since I’ve been increasing the miles on her the last few hikes.  Oh and 4 regular size Gatorades. She’s really helping me train! Can’t you see her smirking? 
 
Stepping off the highway we find a side path and small, well made, sign, North Mountain Trail.
Bonnie is quick to point out another marking…Most Difficult. Giving a thumbs down on this she quizzes me on what is in store next.  All I know is we have to get up to the ridge for easier walking and then hit a side trail off back to our car. Both ends look pretty steep by the maps topo lines. Luckily we have a kiosk in sight to tell us more.
 
And here my friend is when the shit hit the fan. 13.2 miles + 2.5 miles = uhhh that ain’t no 10.4?!?!  Bonnie begins to preach:  Martha!!! You are never off this much!!! I know you are in training but this is torture. You are kidding right? You never fudge more than a mile….
 
I am without words except for apologies. Give me everything you have Bonnie. I will carry it all. I swear I didn’t know this trail was this long. I’d never plan this on a Sunday….That’s a Godly day and now I’ve got us all in a cuss.  It’s not helping that the incline is now all up and we are talking trying to catch our breath. We’ve already had to stop once to shed a layer from sweating even with the cold wind blowing around us. 
 
Legs pumping we make the crest and turn the corner and meet 2 backpackers. We didn’t expect to see anyone today. McAfee lot was packed on our drive by and figure all will be there.  An Aussie and a fella from Minnesota, coworkers out after finishing a project. They tell us the trail is beautiful and we only have a slight more of a climb and then all small undulations across.  Bonnie goes with thumbs up this time and settles in for still yet a long day. 
 
My map shows there are 3 side trails which feed into the North Mountain from a Wildlife Road to our left.  We are hoping for trail signs at these junctions to help with count off the miles.  I also would like to know their distances for come future hikes this way. But betting Bonnie ain’t having any part of that IF we get out of here alive.  We’ve already been joking that since I have these 2 tents and 4 Gatorades we won’t die in the first day of so. Remember no water up here!
 
I’ve already starting counting the fire rings.  4 between the road and our first trail sign, Deer Trail.  We’ve come 2.2 miles. That wasn’t too bad we agree. Well marked trails all with plastic diamond tacked to the trees. North mtn in yellow and side trails in blue. Another sign says 1.4 miles to the next side trail, Grouse. 
 
Wind blows steady, clouds roll over bringing coldness then blue sky tries to let some warmth of the sun by. Shorts are fine while we are moving. Better keep our long sleeves on for a bit longer. We both have packed warm gear too, gloves, hats, and jackets. Ain’t our first hike.
 
No it’s not our first hike, in fact, there’s so many I can’t count them all. Bonnie is my loyal hiking buddy. She’s been along all these years. Lately she’s been my training buddy. Hiking where I want and how far I want.  Funny I’ve never really tabbed her with a trail name. We’ve used a few along the way but nothing that really hit the nail on the head till today. Steadfast!
 
Grouse trail made, 2.9 to Turkey trail.  Wonder if these are named for the best hunting of each animal? Hope there isn’t a bear trail!!!  Two more hikers come our way. 2 college gals, loaded down. Big Osprey packs with stuff all over them. They are out for one more day having hiked the loop too. I’ve gotta do this.
 
Feeling pretty good with our pace we decide once we hit the Turkey trail junction we’ll stop for lunch. I’m already counting the miles in my head. Lunch stop would only put us under half way.  I never like stopping before half way, makes the rest of the day soo long. So I mention we’ll take another break after lunch to refuel.  Bonnie is good with this, says we’ll forage for more food if we need. Wink Wink!
 
Rolling ups and downs keep us working but not exhausted by any means.  This IS a beautiful trail and quite forgiving on the knees. We are walking the easier direction, we finally hit the last side trail, Turkey Trail. Sign says 2.7 miles to Catawba Valley Trail..Wait..that’s our side trail off the mountain. That can’t be right…where did the other miles go?  
 
We look for a place to eat and calculate.  We both have taken a picture of all our junction signs. They add up to 9.2!!! My notes have the Catawba Trail at 2.5. See Bonnie I AM only off like a mile…that’s 11.7. Abracadabra I’ve made the miles disappear. I am still perplexed at the main sign saying North Mountain trail 13.2 but Bonnie’s like who cares as long as we don’t have to walk’em. 
 
Relieved that our day just got a little shorter, we warm in the sun on a big rock and eat most of our rations.  Here Bonnie drink up so I don’t have to carry all these Gatorades. They are still cold from the frig too.  It did feel good to set down a bit and drop the pack.  It is wearing great. I can tell more weight is on my feet but they are doing ok. Will know more about that when the downhill comes later.
 
After a nice 30 minute break we load up with a little more pep in our step.  Finishing at 4:30 sounds a lot better than 6:30.  
 
Flowers and fruit are found along our way.  Oh and a bag up in a tree.  Did someone forget their food? It’s not at a camp spot. Did it get hung up? Nope, Still is tied off ok. We don’t investigate too close. Whoever left might be coming back for it. Maybe a geocache! 
 
One lady slipper sighting, several colors of rhododendrons, flame azalea, wild daisies, oh and loads of blueberry bushes and strawberry blooms. Yes we gotta come back up here.
 
3 more hikers met heading for Dragon’s tooth boy scout camp. They just started from where we parked.   That’s good news we are getting close to our last junction. 
 
We are making great time. 2:45 Catawba Valley Trail!!!  Mystery solved…the North Mountain trail continues on for another 3.9 miles to Wildlife Road.  Bing!  That equals the 13.2.  We’ll try that another time once I find out if the forest road is access able by car. You just bring Anna and TJ for all that Bonnie says.
 
Only 2.5 more left and it’s all Down. Sharp, hairpin turns now.  I can see a bike has come off this trail too. I did read online that this whole area is used by mountain cyclist and is quite technical. No shit, I’m walking and having to take my time on this. All in all this who area is well maintained. Marked well and signed well. Love the trail less traveled.
 
Reaching the bottom land creeks are rushing full from past rains, crossing water 3 times. I counted 12 camp spots from beginning to end with fire rings and ample tent places. 
 
Feet are feeling it a bit and legs need a good stretch. Car traffic is heard. I see the cars Bonnie relays. We throw our arms up in the air, yeehooo. What a day!!! Mystery Miles Made!","North Mountain Trailhead, Rt. 311

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565692,"Bonnie and I rolled into the Davenport tenting area early Friday morning. We always like to set up early so we can get our vendor shopping going. Captain and Shirley are close behind.  Tom and Sandy provide a lovely yard for tent set up and ‘tailgating’.  A full on sunny day has us all excited about the day.
Sandy gives us a quick tour of the yard before getting her tent city set up. Place for picnicking and grilling out must be in place before those threatening evening thunder boomers roll in.  Mallet, Liteshoe, Sale and John are all here. Even a few new faces too. The rest of the crew will be arriving tomorrow.   


Cups loaded and ready for browsing. Gear vendors line the Creeper Trail which co-insides with the AT. Nice for those thru-hikers coming into town…just walk out of the woods to everything you might need.  Gear, Food, Festivities…everything anyone could ask for.
Our day was filled with shopping and seeing old hiking friends.  It was nice to be recognized from some who follow my journal and those I have followed myself. Bob Peoples, The Hiker Yearbook, Appalachian Trials, AWOL, Jen Pharr Davis, The Real Hiking Viking. We saw them all and they saw us. 

Night time fell and it was time to visit downtown’s set up. We checked out Wolfe Hills Brewery satellite station. Bands and the Yellow Deli provided music and food. Hey Aishe, is that you? He runs the hostel in Vermont. He is everywhere. 

Nothing left to do now but see what’s shaking in the real Tent City. This is the area set up for all thru-hikers and more to camp outside of town for a nominal fee. Tents on top of tents. Paths and walk ways built by regulars like Riff Raff, Wonderland, Miss Janet and Billville. They are here every year with a massive following. Come one, Come all and see it ya’ll!
 Here Matt carry this pack. Dustin loads it up. Sandy, Bonnie and I lead the way.  Drums are going, people are reeling. Turn it up, pass it around, be careful don’t fall down. Miss Janet leads the way with instructions to the 2017 hikers. Water gun fight tomorrow, get hiker parade ready folks. Oh and let’s not be up all night with these drums townies need some rest and so do you. 
That was our que to disband and a few sprinkles of rain. What would trail daze be without some rain? Let the fun really begin….

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565722,"Things really kick up on Saturday of Trail Days. The town is filled with local folk and every other hiker that didn’t make it yesterday. Some have come for the day and some have been here most of the week. It’s the last big day to get wild.
After a wet end to the night the sun tries to come on out this morning and heat things up so it can surely rain again this eve. My small patch on my tent held just find from last year’s repair and Thursday’s touch up. It should hold for Maine!!!  Now the REI Ratcliff tent is another story. Matt ditched holding up with Dustin for the car option. Dustin has some inside showers to contend with during the night but was not totally washed out. 
After some morning refreshment and shower at the local bike shop we are ready to rumble once again. More vendor browsing, a trip to tent city to pick up repaired sticks, it getting on to parade time.
 It’s aways a mad dash to get dressed and make sure everyone has some sort of costume item on. This year Bonnie and I are doing a take on Forest Gump, run Forest run…Big Beards, truck caps and mud print smiley faced tshirts.  It’s a pretty good replica of just about 90% of the fellas in this crowd, and The Real Hiking Viking!!  Wagon is loaded with cooler full of cold water, 2 water pressured fire extinguishers and many super soaker water guns. Locked and Loaded here we come.
Captain and family are kicking along with us. Gavin, Emma and Mom Jessica. Get you pistols they are coming for you.  Good thing we have our boys to transport this heavy arss wagon. Bonnie and I worked one year and it liked to have killed us. Beads and Beards boys are ready too. 
Hot dog line has formed at the start of the parade. Sundog Outfitters feeds everyone nicely. Dresses on fellas, crazy costumes and clouds already forming above. It gonna be a wild and rainy event. 
Horns blow on the firetrucks its time. It’s a 2 mile walk of wondering who’s gonna fire on who. Water hoses, gushes from buckets but they have no match for the blast of our extinguishers. Firing a stream of water clear across the road and picking off a window shooter is our game. Then super soaking that little rascal who has just shot his wad. Sucker!!! 
No one was safe, even the hiking gods took care of that by dumping their rains upon us right at the gauntlet…that’s the area when the parade comes to a slow move as it finishes up near the park. No bystander stood a chance from not getting wet especially us in the parade, we were a wet mess. It was a blast!!
The rains held on for another hour it seemed like while we huddled under our yard tents. But eventually the storm broke and it was time to redress for the gear giveaways and get back for the Davenport Cookout. Denny, Noni and company helped with cooking while my group tried to win that new piece of hiking gear. We did manage some toss ups and goodies, while some won that big box of gear to suit you up for a whole trip on the trail. Jim and buddy coonhound made the scene and caught up with Larry, Jeff and Harry.  Good friends and good times all around.
Night time comes once again and there are more activities to keep you going to the wee hours of the morning if you wish.  This ol gal was happy to be huddled around a nice fire pit with friends. No fire ring tonight, I’ll let the thump on the drums sing me to sleep or at least nap in this chair right here.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566896,"I have this day hike to myself…well that is all relative. What started out as a lone wolf hike soon became thru hiker central.

Hitting the trail, loaded for bear, its 9am. I’m off for Angels Rest and beyond. Hiking till I decide to turn around. If I told most that I for sure would be hiking by myself every weekend.  

Pack is full of all my tents, 3 to be exact, 2 liters of water and 2 gatorades, lunch, and a few things for weight. My guess I’m toting 20 pounds. I didn’t weigh it but feels like weight I’ll be carrying in Maine. Train for Maine, feel the Pain!

Awesome sunny day with coolness in the air. It showered last night so that has left it so the muggies will soon be.  Just a jeep in the parking lot off Rt. 100/Narrows Rd. It is backed up in the tall grass so betting they are out for a long weekend.  This new trail now leads up a less step approach to Angels Rest for the first part anyways. Waste tall field grass with a mashed down path leads me in the tree’s shade. Wow it has greened up since last over here. All this rain has ground cover extra full. Feels like the woods has grown two fold.  I hardly get started and am sweating. Glad I have all the extra water to drink.

Just past the rock wall area I meet my first thru hiker of the day. Scallywag from CA. He is loving the east and VA. He spent the night in town and is reloaded for Daleville’s next resupply. Asking if I am SOBOing , I tell him all about where I am on the trail and that my buds and I are headed for Maine. Giving me an “at a girl” he kicks off and disappears in a flash.  

Reaching our normal parking spot on up the mountain, 634, I cross the road and see the new hostel, Angels Rest Inn has posted their cards. Zerolicious! Best catch word I’ve ever seen. If I didn’t live here I’d stay for sure. I did consider calling Neville at Woods Hole Hostel for a shuttle back to my car today had I hiked from here on over to her place. Would have been 10 miles or so but with the storm chances thought best to be on my own time. I’m sure she’ll be shuttling folks for slack packs back to her anyways. (and yes that was the case, met 3 doing just that on my way back)

Back on the original trail now it’s time to churn and burn. All up baby, get those legs working and sticks clickin. Feeling pretty good I don’t slow initially, keeping my normal pace. Hiker Hiker Hiker, here they come. About every switchback I meet 2 to 3 hikers busting it for town. The trail is still mucky in places to slow them some but not much. I give direction of mileage till they hit pavement and am greeted with big smiles. One dude was running down. Hot soup, Hot soup. 
Dishes, Trek, Sun and Asian friend, can’t remember his name and many more come my way. Totaling 28 for the day. And that doesn’t count the weekenders I passed either. 

I did ask how Dishes got her name, was is because she liked to do dishes or maybe not….said she was at Springer telling knock knock jokes.  Knock knock!, Who’s there? Dishes. Dishes who? Dish Ish Sean Connery. Speaking in his knighted Scottish accent. Then she followed up with more info on herself all with the Scottish voice. Was hilarious from this little gal. 

Leaving them its head down for the rest, and I really mean rest in all senses of the word. The last turn up has no switch backs and I’m really feeling this weight and the pace has slowed to tractor gear. 
Petals of pink line the trail, the rhododendrons are in spectacular bloom. Seems a fitting time to reach out and leave a message for Captain. He is just out of surgery yesterday.  A long process to remove cancer on the mouth and had plastic surgery. Can you see these flowers surrounding me big guy? My video spans all around. Sending my love and theirs to you to brighten your and Shirley’s day. Thinking of you while I hike this here mountain.

Reaching to sign for the rest it’s time to rest. I drop my pack along with another and walk out to see. I’ve been her a dozen or more time and I have never encountered such beauty. Filming my walk in the petals are plentiful. Arch way of blooms. A hiker sets on the rock rest. A perfect photo. I don’t disturb, I’ll be back by here later and have my time and leave him to his. 

Heading for Wilburn Overlook, it’s only .9 to the crest. This will be a good spot for a snack and I’ll walk on out for aways and double back. Clouds are rolling in and darkened.  Humm rain, not supposed to till later. I check my phone but nothing will load. Checking in with Larry he says 2:00 storms coming. It’s 11:00ish now. Walking past the spring sign I decide I’ll add this to my hike today on the return trip. See if it is running and that will add another .4 to  my day. 

At the overlook 2 white bearded fellas are checking their phones. Oh I meant to talk about electronics. This is the most I’ve seen kids with buds in their ears. Every hiker, all ages now, has something pumping in their head. I start to speak and they have to pull the plug to hear me. And if they don’t pull then I know no need to stop, they ain’t talking.  

Hey fellas where is everyone from, Ohio, Kentucky, one meeting wife in town for a break over the Memorial Day weekend. Another going to the Holiday Inn. Safe travels to Maine fellas. I have this rock all to myself, snack time and time to decide on my hiking plan. 

Decision made to walk on to the “lone rhodie bush” and turn around. I can stretch the legs on this fairly flat walk and then on to the water source.  
Peacefully hike out the ridge, trail green as ever. Looks so different in the spring verse winter when I’m usually up here. Birds, bees, and me. The lone bush, I go on a bit farther, got here quicker than I thought. Once the trail starts to turn down I about face and before I know it am back at the side path to the spring. Sassafras and what looks like blueberry bushes line the trail.
A slight walk down and soon water flows in the trail, trickles can be heard. Good source and footprints show it has been used. Lots of camp spots too. Several fire rings formed.  Might have to come back for an overnight.

Back to the AT and time to bust off of here. I make a lunch stop on the rest and enjoy my time and my view.  Pearsiburg can you see me? A gal from Norway come in, relocated to Raleigh. I had to laugh when I asked where was home and she said NC…no way baby, you ain’t from around here!  She didn’t have a trail name yet but I’d called her No Way.  

Down Down, I feel the press on the knees now. Legs doing good but it’s a long 2000 feet off of here. My sticks start to collapse a bit..utoh..I just had these serviced at trail days. Didn’t know this was an issue and didn’t say for them to look at this. 

Almost out of the woods, see the parking lot..More weekenders coming in. Big ol packs, young and old. Have fun guys, it’s great up there. Follow the pink petals to paradise.","Rt. 100/Narrows Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566899,"They say all that wander are not lost. Come on Larry let's wander. Well he wasn't as enthused as I but hey he did come up with part of this plan today.  He knew it was my weekend  to check in on signage at Pine Swamp shelter and suggested we do so along with notices to hikers of Captain's hiker feed cancellation. Cool we can cover various miles and he'll never know how much.

So how far is it to the shelter? He is already calculating. Half mile is deduced. It's really .3. I have extra signs from the Rangers station in case others torn down.  Dead fall area.  Trees damages from Gypsy moths.  Shelter closed. No camping within 300 yards. 

We reach the shelter and all are intact. Checking the shelter log see hikers have been in and out to sign in but not staying. Some trash left behind that we'll pack out. This  is L-train’s stop. ""I'll hang here and warn those hikers as they pass while you go on up to the top of Peters Mountain"".  I see a nap coming on!  

Sign here says 1.3 to the top. Hums I thought it was 2. Oh well I'm going to the top either way. Back in a while. 

Trail is all up from here but graded and has lots of switch backs. Just was over a few weeks ago I can almost predict what's around each corner. Wish I had a better memory on mileage, HA.   And this corner holds hikers.  Hey guys no staying at the shelter and The Captain’s is closed. The word has already spread along the trail. 

I press to work a little harder since I am not packed heavy today. Regular day pack with a little extra water for both Larry and I.  Let's see how fast I can get to the top.  

More hikers and these all have familiar faces.  Hey its the knee brace two. How was Pearisburg?  All dried out, resupplied and rested, they are surprised to see me. Hey how'd you get here?  Magic baby.  We saw each other Saturday. Trail sign maintenance today folks. Happy trails. 

Wish I'd brought a small hand saw.  Could have done some real work and removed small blow downs. Next time that will be in the bag. Counted 8 that need attention. One of which needs a big chain saw.  

And more hikers approach. It's Dishes, Sun and the Asian fellows name I have forgotten. He remembers mine and asks how my section hike is going. I think he thought I was out for the whole weekend. Is my sign at the top? Yep they say, all good.  

Leaving them I realize I have been hiking close to an hour and have been moving pretty fast even for uphill.  1.3. Hog wash. Gotta be more like 2. I set my mind on trying to catch these past hikers after going to the top. Push it push it push it.  I text Larry while walking to let him know this leg of our trip is longer than expected.  Ha imagine that. Just the way I like it.  

Lady slippers, galax leaves, tea berry. They all are out on Peters Mountain. Now I just gotta find the Allegheny Trail sign and see for myself this mileage. 

Cresting out, its drawing in close. A nice breeze, ridge light. Bam. Sign.  2.5 miles in less than an hour. Wiping sweat from my brow I text The Captain. Guess where I am at?  It is his mountain ya know.  He used to train on this exact section when we were hiking together.  Would hike up it every evening. 

It Memorial Day, have my red white and blue star beads on.  Thank you soldiers for giving us our freedom.  I salute you..  Now I gotta run, have a time to beat and hikers to catch.  
I text Larry once again to let him know nap time is almost over. Unbeknownst to me he has been invaded by some Boy Scouts.  They didn't know the shelter was closed. They come in for a quick minute but their leaders move them on back to another location.  We never did see them the rest of the day.  

Larry has ventured on up the trail and left his own signs.  Twigs lay out as arrows and resembles the AT emblem. I saw them as I was quick steppin.  At the time I was like wonder who left those?  Didn't see on the way up?

Back to the water crossing I'm only minutes from the shelter.....and there's my last hiker I spoke to, caught ya again. He smiles and steps aside for me to pass about the time we run into the Train.  He has pulled off the trail looking for fish.  I get a “where have you been”,  no service so he didn't get my messages.  Heck fire I've been hiking what have you been doing?  Oh did the tall tale begin...I've been hiking for miles up and back on this mountain.  I've talked with scouts, directed hikers, had a snack....you'd thought oh Larry had been out here all day.  

Passing back by the shelter we see our acquaintances having lunch.  Trail magic guys. Look for magic across the road at Cherokee Flats. Those almost done eating eat a little faster to get a jump on their friends.  Come on LTrain we got tracks to make.

We jump in the car and head for Captains.  Drop sodas and get 2 cases of cold ones he has in the frig.  Play with his doggies and tell them their master will be home soon.  We post a sign..Hiker feed canceled, zip line closed, yard closed so the Captain can recover from surgery.  

Heading to Cherokee Flats Larry is already wondering how far he has to walk this time.  Oh it's a mile from the flats by trail to captains.  See we plan to post a sign on the trail side of the creek so hikers will know why his zip line is closed.  Next weekend is usually the big feed and 100 or so hiker will be passing. First time closed like this in 13 years. That's a lot of happy hikers fed and entertained.  

Before we start our walk we put soda magic out and double back on the trail.  Larry is in a strolling mode and I'm still in race pace.  Step aside lollygagger.  If you want to walk this mile in granny slow it gonna take an hour.  Isn't there a hill I gotta go up he asks? Yes but its short and then one more.  I get a… huh? And lose sight of him. After hill 2 I offer some Gatorade and get a good bye kiss.  It's time for the Ltrain to return for some more coal.  

Stepping off this downhill I will be at the creek side in about 10 minutes I'm guessing.    Here is where I begin to meet everyone again.  Trail magic don't forget those sodas.  Thank you thank you.  Give your thanks to the Captain..drop him a text for quick recovery.  I tack the closed sign at the zip line location.  

Time to ramble back. Our mission is complete. All signs, check! Miles in, check! Hiker magic, check! Happy hikers, check!","Stony Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567483,"Sometimes you never know what’s in store, especially on a new trail. We’d already walked some of this old AT, North Mountain Trail and its side trail, Catawba Mtn Trail. How bad can it be? The answer might “lie” between the lines…Most Difficult and Wildlife Road.

My kids are back…haha..not really mine nor are they kids now but that’s just what I call my two youngest hikers in this little pack. Good ol’ Steadfast if here too. Bonnie is up for this challenge today, a 12.8 mile trek. It’s another training day with a heavy pack on and expecting some more ups and down like before. Little did we know “You’re in the Jungle Baby and you’re gonna die!”

Stepping across from Andy Lane trailhead parking many cars are here but everyone is going the opposite hike of us. Our kiosk sign shows we have a “most difficult” hike up Catawba Mountain. Bonnie and I can attest to this from coming down it. Today we’ll get the pleasure of both ways as every step we have to return on.

It’s a shady hike but a warm morning. Just passing the couple for creek crossings I warn this is the only water on this trek better get it now or forever be without a drink. 

Long switch backs turn us into a hot sweaty mess. About a mile or so in I’m ready for a swig of Gatorade for a little extra boost. We all have one packed and take a chug before gearing up the legs. I’m working my newly fine-tuned sticks. No problem with them compressing down with extra weight bearing. TJ has elected no sticks. He’s all smiles be bopping up this while Anna is huffing behind me. Bonnie says I’ll see ya at the sign as we disappear from her sight. 

1000+ feet later we crest this rascal glad to see those signs.  Wildlife road 3.9 miles. That’s our destination folks. Most Difficult sign warns us. Humm thought we just did that, Bonnie says in an exasperated notion. Questions come of what is this trail like?  Uhh haven’t hiked but we sure are gonna find out. 

Within 100 yards I’m wondering if this was such a good idea. We are in ankle deep grass with little of a trail to be seen underneath. Not a warn dirt path by far. Up and over the next hill I’m getting the same thoughts in verbal abuse from my 3. What kind of trail IS THIS? Anyone see a yellow diamond? Uhhh if I don’t start seeing one I’m gonna have somebody seeing stars!!!

In and out of unkept trail we stay close together muttering about this jungle we are trudging through. Good thing we all sprayed down with Bonnie’s insect replant. Wonder if it will keep the bears away? Some areas are knee high on me with undergrowth. I look over my shoulder to make sure Bonnie doesn’t disappear in the depth. 

Wildlife trail is blazed with plastic yellow diamonds tacked to the trees. Some pretty far apart or so it seems since I can’t see a distinct path lots of the time. Shit I can’t see my shoes most of the time.  Here’s a diamond that fell from a tree. Anna puts in my pack. Martha’s blazed now, she’ll always be on trail, TJ laughs.  Uhh a cross roads… no blaze and we are turning off the ridge. Can’t be far enough to turn down to the road yet. I take the low road literally, a fire road to see what’s next. Anna and TJ look on the ridge for clues. Bonnie says I’ll just stay right here till we know more. 

Diamond Diamond I have it. Down down and then we flatten out on a secondary ridge. Tinker cliffs can be faintly seen to our right and the big cement plant. Catawba rhododendrons engulf us. I have to use my sticks to push aside to make my way. Our legs are starting to get quite the rash now. Yikes. 

This being the kid’s second big training hike they are doing quite well. Anna is ready for first lunch. A snack couldn’t hurt any of us. Our vegetarian has a challenge with hiking exertions which soon can lead to exhaustion if not feed properly.  We are soaked with sweat and marvel at our speckled legs. Sure hope this doesn’t turn into something worse. 

In and out of thickets we come to what I feel is a prime area for some animal to jump out and get us… uhhh What’s that Bonnie asks? Bear scat. How do you know? Well it looks like human scat and has berries in it…Hope he doesn’t eat me and then will have bones in it she laughs. Say are those horse hooves? Anna starts looking for ponies to get a ride. There were many tracks but no sign of life. 

After several killer ups and downs we are finally turning off this ridge to what might be our final descent to the road.  Rumblings of dread emanate us all ... we have to come back up all this. Say maybe we can hitch a ride from the forest road back? How far is the walk on the road back to one of those side trails I think? We wouldn’t have to rewalk all the rubble. It would add way to many miles to the Most Difficult day already. 

Good thing about this part down is we finally have good trail. Just like the Catawba trail this is a warn path and we are making tracks easily. Listen I hear a car… we are just at the road stopping for lunch when a truck whirls by.. Hey Hey stop Anna jokes we need saving…we just missed the boat…literally. He was pulling a boat.

Lunch was much needed and so was getting our shoes and socks off.  Feet are free of debris. Not much air in the gap, we stay glistened. After a 30 minute break we know what’s in store and face the music…Most Difficult.

Bonnie I’ll stop periodically to make sure you are in sight and caught up if we get to far ahead. She may be in for a new trail name, Hardcore. Busting out these miles at a strong seasoned age of 64 is amazing.  Here TJ carry this pack for me she jokes all the while strapping it on and muscling up right behind him. Sorry gal I’m no help to you today I’ve got my own 20lb load and glad to have eaten some of that weight away. 

Our engines run steady getting back up to the top. Slow and steady wins the race. Feeling pretty good I don’t stop, head down and sticks clickin. Its back to the ridge and those thickets once again. Time to make sure we are all caught up from time to time. This part goes by faster since I recall some landmarks. Just make it to the fire road and we’ll have this beat. 

There needs to be 3 hikers a day to work this path back in shape TJ says. And everyone needs a weedeater, LOL  I can tell where we have rambled along so it would help. Fire road where are you?

Diamond Diamond yes. Resting at the top Bonnie comes in smiling and preachin. That was one hell of a climb back there. Are we done yet? One and done Martha. I’m not coming back to Wildlife Road with you. You are on your own!

Our grassy walk back to the Catawba junction was quick. Show me your legs!!! I take a photo of our rashes for the record. Chug that last bit of Gatorade we got a long ways down yet to come. 
The elders send the youngins on, their knees can handle a quicker pace than ours. 

Good trail was much appreciated even though Most Difficult. Lol  Blue Diamonds to follow now. Switchbacks to that stream. We had talked about stopping for fresh water but it was so close to the finish we only wet our bandanas to wash off. Yikes there’s a snake over here Bonnie. Stepping close to the water I was 2 to 3 feet away from putting my rag in and saw him resting on the branch bottom blending in perfectly with the leaves. Good sized I gave him all the room he needed and I ventured to another location. 

Car traffic never sounded so good. We have survived the Wildlife. Anna and TJ give us thumbs up. The jungle didn’t take us but it did hand us a Most Difficult day!","Catawba Mtn Trail

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570145,"Load up troops we have a haul to Bland County. Training in Tazewell today. Burkes Garden is our destination but getting there is a drive. A good hour and half. I have the kids back and City Slicka. The garden will be all new to them and it’s been awhile since I was last there so looking forward to its grandness.


Driving through the Big Walker tunnel the temp has drop 7 degrees and we are in a sea of fog. That misty mountain haze that hangs on peeks after a storm has rolled by overnight. Get on out of here I say, I have much to show off and this just won’t do. 

Turning up the forest road my passengers are a tad skeptical on just where ol Lead Dog is taking them. Winding dirt road twists up the mountain and then we go right back down it again. This is Poor Valley folks. Clap board shanties, barking dogs, and wood piles. A backwoodsman paradise. Look a hostel Anna spies. Sure enough a family has set up a place for a hiker to get “help” in this remote area. Say if we have some leftover drinks from trail magic we’ll bring them back here.

Pulling off at this small side of the road parking spot we see the Poor Valley Hostel has put a sign for hikers to point them to their place. 3.2 mile walk it would be and catching a ride on this road would be slim and slim left town. 

Trail Magic time. Sodas iced down, a small notepad and pen I shall leave asking those passing by to tell me where they are from and when they started. Time to hike.

Another training day. It’s all up hill to Chestnut Knob, 4.5 miles. Burkes Garden is our reward. Then it’ll be hell to pay cause I’m taking you down to take you right back up again, Walker Gap, for a 2.8 round trip of knee jarring and leg burning “fun”.

Carolann is all in, says she’ll hang with us. How come Bonnie did come? Uh she knows me and is smarter than you. Finishing off her morning breakfast cig she begins to rub down her legs. TJ asks if he can use some of that tooth paste…wew what’s that smell I ask…BenGay? Oh girl you are about to get a new trail name…TJ recommends Newport! Wasn’t that your brand of smokes? Nope Salem Lites baby. Come on Miss Menthol let’s get you up this mountain.

TJ sets a pretty good pace out of the gate. I’m huffing as we crest the first little up and head for the butt of the mountain.  Enjoy this slight grade it won’t last that long. No Carolann, I look over my shoulder. Anna says she was just here. Sure got quiet. HA HA

Stopping for a water break Carolann joins us. Here have some Gatorade.  Red faced and sweeting she’s ready for a drink. Shit I could have stayed back with the cooler and introduced hikers to the trail she says. Yep we all could but not today. 

Taking the lead I settle us in to a slightly slower pace. Some of this I remember and tell about this section being my first overnight backpacking trip. Loaded for bear back then, carrying 45 pounds of STUFF and we hiked from Rt. 42 much farther back than the road we started from today. What a time that was. Glad we all have graduated from rookie league.  

I’m carrying my training pack today 23lbs when I weighed it this morning. Feels pretty good. I don’t want carry any more than this in 2 weeks. Here drink some more Gatorade.

Seeing the sky light thru the trees I’m pretty sure we are closing in on the open fields guys. Fields? Anna questions…this isn’t more bushwacking is it like last week? Shouldn’t be. Usually the trail maintainers bush hog the path so it is wide and tall grass free. 

Heavy clouds still rest on us still. Uggh blow out. We wait on Carolann at the grass line and compare medical kit items we plan to take to Maine. No need in duplicating if we don’t have to. Nurse Anna and Dr Bones should have us more than covered for that wilderness adventure. 

Carolann rolls out of the woods. “I made it guys” Told ya I’d make it!!! Gulping some more Gatorade she is all smiles to be here. 

Tall grass rolls like waves with the breeze. Ahh it feels like air conditioner. It wasn’t mowed but we did have a distinct path with knee high grass all around. 2 miles of wide open spaces. Mountain ranges peek out every so often and then even more often with my begging for clearness to stay. Once we see our shadows we know it’s gonna be a great day. 

Chestnut Knob’s shelter, rock enclosed with clouded old shatter proof windows awaits us but first let’s see this garden….Ooos and Ahhhs… this giant wonder was formed when underground limestone caverns collapsed. The mountain valley is the highest in Virginia at around 3,000 feet above sea level and is completely surrounded by Garden Mountain. Patchwork of fertile fields and farms with barns and silos fill the bowl. The name ""Burke's Garden"" was given to the valley as a joke in 1748 after James Burke, a hunter, planted potato peelings by the campfire of a surveying party. The next year a fine crop came up. 

Checking out the shelter we find the King. A fellow from England who started hiking May 18. He was carrying quite the pack, 46 pounds he said. Fixing some blistered feet he was making big miles per day having already hiked 10 and planning to finish off another 15. Sharing our food we chatted more until other hikers arrived. Hey it’s Steve..I forgot to tell you he was at the road this morning and was our first to receive magic. A gal came into but can’t remember her name. All were most appreciative of extra candy bars, grapes and peanut butter crackers given. 

Ok troops enough visiting we got Walker Gap to kick.  Uh why Carolann asks? No Pain, No Maine. She walks about 300 yards with us as the trail cuts sharply DOWN. Uhh I’ll just walk along slowly and ya’ll go on ahead you can catch me on the return she instructs.  We agree that is a good plan for her.

TJ and Anna are off running. These old legs will take their time on this down so the knees will remain happy. Work out is one thing punishment is another. How far to the bottom they ask? About 30 minutes I’d say.

King and the chick are already gone out of site ahead of us. Bet we catch them. An old forest road is cut across twice on the down and I know we are closing in on the gap. 35 minutes. Good time. The thru-hikers are here after getting some water. Ya’ll have a great hike back up they say. 

Ya’ll kids go on ahead I’ll take it up Lead Dog Low…uh go ahead Martha you lead the way. They are just making me feel good. And it worked. I did feel good. I panted just like them and took a quick breather at forest road 1 and we plowed the rest of the way up meeting Steve. He said your friend is heading back to the car. We have a good laugh out loud and are glad she made the right call. Now let’s try to catch her.

One last look at the garden, all clear now, what a treat. Our field walk was just as impressive, being able to see mountain after mountain range was awesome. We met a few hikers, day and thru on the way back. 

Humm I don’t remember this part Anna says. Did we climb this? Early morning ups and chatting make for quick memory loss every time. Wonder if Carolann has a party going on at the trail magic cooler? Good thing she doesn’t have my car key we’d be dry coming in. 

This quick return down has me ready for a cold drink. Say guys did you get our magic? A couple setting by the trail thanks us.  A hiker from Wales say the trail hasn’t been too good to him but that cold drink was mighty fine. Wish I could give you more today fella, you keep your head up and things will get better. You have a grand view ahead of you, take it all in and enjoy. 

Woop Woop CA we are back girl. Let’s celebrate our day. Cold drinks while cooling our jets. Here Kevin you take our extra magic and give to the hikers coming your way. He runs the Poor Valley Hostel down the way and was driving by to fetch some spring water for the lady back at the cabin. Now that don’t get more country than that!

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570753,"If you want an ass kicking just go to the Sarver Holler Trail. I asked for it and it delivered. 

I decided to park at the main area of Caldwell Fields and hike up the road for some added mileage and elevation gain. My 24 pound training pack is going to give me just about all I want to handle going up this 1800 foot climb. 

HOT Already it is HOT. A beautiful humid day with a chance of thunderstorms around noon. Rain will be ok I think but let’s wait till I’m on the return side of this trip. 

A car or two are parked along the road walk. Guess they are out for a long 4th of July weekend. I wonder if I’ll see any thru hikers today?

Turning off the road guessing I’ve walked about a half mile it’s time for the side trail to begin. I know what’s in store but a full pack will be a game changer. No Pain No Maine. 

Heat rolls up in the my face thru the grassy power line approach. The woods are a welcome chance to breathe and with this grade can warm up to that leg burn that awaits.  The trail grows more narrow time to dig in Lead Dog Low!

Steady pace just keep those legs pumping. So glad this isn’t the oversized steps that Maine will have. This is the closest thing I know around to challenge me for that. Steeper, Hotter, I’m truly dripping with sweat. Most ever I do believe. I take a few stops to just regroup, wipe my brow and even my hands. The sweat is rolling down my arms making the grips on my sticks slick. I’m gonna chug that Gatorade I have when I reach the shelter. 

No switchbacks here just straight up the gut of the holler. Super powers where are you? I have my wonder woman cape. Bring it Bruisers Knob. Hearing the trickle of the little mountain stream I know I’m closing in on the ruins. Nothing looked so good as those old rock chimneys standing tall in this lush forest. The corn crib has fallen in some more and the entire old home place is dilapidated. Sun shines off the shelter’s tin roof, I’ve made it, a wet hot mess!

Pack is soaked, I am soaked, chug chug. Spying trash I gather it all up and place in a fire pit I will be passing back by later and will haul it out. Pack it in, Pack it out Folks!  I hear voices up behind the shelter. Must be hikers coming down for water I think. Humm they are moving too fast for that. Trail runners, they don’t even see me at the shelter and are gone in a flash. Wow I’d be face planting on this grade if I moved with any speed.  Well time to finish the remainder of my up and connect with the AT. At least this part is all long switchbacks. 

Reaching the AT junction my wonder woman cap is on and I celebrate this kick ass climb. At a Girl and a Woop Woop! Now let’s get in some Sinking Creek Mountaintop miles. 

Hiking north toward Niday shelter is the plan. I won’t go that far since I have to hike back so going out to where the rocks start and will have lunch where I can see out. Not a sole is seen. The walk is easier than I remember. No PUDS to contend with. That’s Persistent Ups and Downs.  Only worn down trail cutting thru the green undergrowth, very relaxing hiking now. 

Extra light pops thru the next set of trees that must be the opening to the rocks. Yes Lunch time. 
Wide open spaces. McAfee and Peaks of Otter can be seen way off. Can’t believe it!  I drop my pack and find a partially shaded area to set down and eat. No shoes, No People, No Problem. 
I was almost too hot to eat and remember feeling this way during some days in NH last year. Must eat, must keep going. Grape, Cherries and power bar, yum. I have many other snacks but just don’t feel that hunger to dig into them. 

Watching the enormous clouds hover over me I am thankful to just be here and in this moment. However I can’t set her all day, life calls me back home, come on wonder woman lets go.

The return brought me to 4 hikers. 3 of which I had met last week. How cool. I offered my food to the first 2 but they were getting off the trail this eve for some town time, from Christiansburg.  My other 2 I met back at the AT junction and Sarver. They were having lunch and talking about Four Pines, Catawba and The Homeplace. Say are you The King? And you are Lead Dog? Hey I’m Double Barrel we all met last at Chestnut knob!  Giving them all my leftovers in exchange for their trash and some local knowledge of what they have ahead I was deemed a Trail Angel.  

Good luck guys, keep knocking out those miles and I expect to see you on top of Katahdin real soon. 

Down Down this is just as much of a work out as coming up. I grab that trash at Sarver Shelter and get myself ready for the knee jarring ahead. Not a breeze at all. I’m back to dripping wet again. Sticks are holding me strong and the thighs are burning good. Tight as a banjer string when I hit the partial flatness. I’m gonna need some yoga. 

Busting out of the woods I’ve reached the gates of hell or is it the just the powerlines? 1000 degrees, my cape is melting. But I’ve made it,  you can’t kill this wonder woman but you sure can kick her ass.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573210,"Nothing like getting up at 4:00am to find out our train has a 3 hour delay. Not knowing if we need to be there for stand-by in case the timing changes we decide since we are up and ready to roll on to the Lynchburg Station as see. 

Our hosts, Jordan, Scott and Colton Buckner, have put us up for the night. We had a great dinner last night and in bed fairly early to be ready for today. 

The waiting game continued as we lounged around the station till almost 9:00.  We certainly passed for railyard hobos carrying our all we own for this trip on our backs.  The Amtrak attendant kept us posted on departure and told us a freight derail had caused this delay and all passenger trains would have to wait second hand till the freight was cleared and under way.

The delay carried over the rest of the day for each connection point. Our New York connection to Boston wasn’t looking like it would even happen.  But with the help of Shakik, our main man, Anna and I worked out we didn’t have to sleep in the Amtrak station in NY but could get a late train to Boston arriving like 1:00am.  We were supposed to be in Portland way before then and tucked in bed at Caribou John’s home, my Maine contact. 

Our fun really began while we waited on the train ride to Boston as we now have no place to stay once we arrive…Amtraks NY hotels were all booked and they said book what you can in Boston and they would reimburse. Sure hoping so cause all we found were quite expensive. 

TGI Fridays  in the train station provided us a corner to drown our frustrations while calls to hotels and rental cars got underway. 5 appetizers later and several beers in we had a hotel right by the Boston Station and our rental ride awaiting us for the next morning.

Up early we have decisions to make…Have a rental car/van to pick up, do we haul ass straight for Gorham and figure out the car return there? Ughhh we already recall how that went last year and on a Sunday betting we will have no one to settle this deed.  Do we hook up with John some way to shuttle us.
Ring Ring…Saved by the Bell…Caribou John has all the answers.  Drive to him in Portland, we can return the car there and he’ll shuttle us to Gorham and we can get this hike underway.  Once again we are behind the time table, should have been hiking this morning…

After some Enterprise calls we have wheels and are burning up the highway out of Bean Town. Jim’s got the wheel and TJ’s got the tunes hummin. We’re comin in hot John.

Couple hours later we are headed from Portland for the trail. John gives a guided tour town to town from Maine to New Hampshire.  We have 16 miles of NH to pick up so we’ll head back to the White Mountain Hostel where the trail crosses US 2.  The Presidential Range surrounds us.

2:00pm  Packs ready, town clothes are secured with John for later reconnect, uhh guess we better eat a bite before we start hiking.  We’ve been in such a whirl forget about lunch. Water check, sticks check, pack on…Thanks for everything Caribou we’ll see you in 2 weeks.

Target camp is Trident Col. We had hoped for 12 miler to Gentian Pond Shelter but with this late start we’ll be lucky to hit first camp by 7:00.  

A road walk turns into a gradual climb for Mount Hayes. Then it begins…. Rock!  Nothing too crazy but enough to give Anna her first taste of the White Mountains. Slopping rock for a trail, gritty granite allow for a decent foot hold but don’t slip our you will peel your hide right off. Looks guys that’s Mount Washington over there!

Adrenaline gets us up and over and on to Cascade Mountain before we drop off to the Col. Col = the lowest point between two peaks, the saddle. There are no valley’s here. Just deep gashes between mountain peaks, straight up and straight down. 

From Cascade we could see all the Presidential Range we hiked last year. Sun is beginning to drop between ranges and we’d better scoot for camp. 

Most hikers are already in for the night. Hiker midnight starts at 8pm. We have about an hour to get our tents up, water retrieved and eat supper. Jim scouts for tent spots, we’ll have to separate here and the rest of us get water for us 4. 

Tired and hungry but happy to just be here we enjoy our supper and toast to the party of four getting back out together again. We chat with some NOBO’s and SOBO’s; one Scottsman in particular who will become a part of my stories.  His name is Highlander, hiking north, doing big sections, this one from Harpers Ferry to Katahdin to finish the AT up. 

Tucked in my tent I review my maps and our big day tomorrow…14.5 miles to keep us from having too many miles on day 3 into the Mahoosuc Notch.  We cross into Maine tomorrow as well and I can’t wait.","Boston-Portland-US 2 Gorham,NH

We do have another shelter to hold up at if need be called Carlo Col at the 10 mile mark but this will be only in emergency. 

Packed up and ready we are off for day 2 and will be closing out the state of New Hampshire today.  Whoop whoop.  That means 13 states down and one left, MAINE. (I do have 61 miles left in PA, but plan to hike it this Oct). 

Weather is hot, Surprisingly humid and we are already getting eaten by the mosquitos.  They just love Anna. It's that young fair skin. I normally don't have much trouble but am having to spray not only my hat but arms and legs. 

Ledges....any time you see this on the map expect open rock face, slanted usually and all up hill. We climb to Wocket Ledge and have some open views out of the Col.  Now you'd think from tops of mountains you be on a ridge with dry ground.  Not here...its black thick mud and some times plank boards to walk over to keep from sinking up.  One miss step and you'll lose a shoe. I almost did as my foot slid and was sucked in.  Glad I had my higher socks on or I would have felt the muck between my toes.  

Natural lakes and pond surround us but we don't realize till we are almost on top of them since the woods are so dense.  We scan for moose every chance we have but that is limited since our eyes are on each foot step with this rooted, rock, muck of a trail.  

Mount Success stands in our way to the state line. Straight up for a mile and I'm starving. Jim and I are leading the pack.  I'm feeling strong and happy that I am pushing up these rocks much better than last year at this stage. Haha. Day 2. Stage. 
Anna on the other hand is asking when she can call John for rescue and play with Rusty (that's his new puppy). She'd be much happier with them right now.  You got this girl. Keep diggin. 

Thick balsams hug the edges of the rock path we follow.  I hear voices so we must be close to the top.  A group of 10 gals are out for a backpacking adventure. They are from all over, foreign and domestic.  Highlander and his hiking lady friend are on top too.  Wind chills us quickly since we are soaking wet with sweat.  Eat eat get some fuel for energy.  Struggling to chew Anna is in need of that something cold ' she is craving.  She wishes she could just drink her calories but that is pretty hard when every ounce counts.  Water = weight.  

Success gave us wonderful views back over The Whites and provided us with a since of accomplishment.  Now let's boogie for that border.

Large boulders scatter the trail. This ain't no trail. Did the ATC decide to play a trick on us? Butt scootin, rebar Hoppin, stick droppin-don't need these when you need your hands to hold on...yucks we gotta go down that?  My legs don't stretch that far.  And this was over yet another mile.  What went down went right back up and then there it was....the Maine state line.

3:30. It's taken us since 7:00am to hike almost 10 miles. Back home that would equate to a 16 mile day.  No time to bitch about that now.....we just completed another state.  Way to go team. Happy to stand along side of this sign we throw our arms up and cheer. Let's post this for the #TrektheAT and get famous.  

In short time we reach Carlo Col, 4:00. We need water and its .3 off the trail and the shelter is this way.  But not the one we need to hold up at.  Us gals discuss the option to as the fellas haul ass down hill to retrieve water for us.  Taking 30 minutes to do so we have a snack and wonder if we just start dos that way we could keep the fella here...just kidding...we have 4 more miles we gotta make.  

Highlander comes by and he is without his hiking friend. She has hurt herself, knee injury and come off the trail.  He looks a wee bit down and has decided to hold up here for the night.  A nobo named CrazyHorse from Texas also comes by. I called him catfish since he was carrying a broken down fishing pole.  Says he has had some good fishin days and is hoping to be on Katahdin in less than the time we are scheduled to do our stretch.  No water for him...to far he'll just take his chances and get water at the next shelter.  Hope to see ya there we say.

Four miles. We can do four mile before 7:00. Map shows rolling hills, we can see them as we hit a stretch of openness.  It ain't no field walk folks.  It's ridge line, rock path between balsams that are head or so high. You can see the next hill but we can't get there without some crazy work on rebar, wooden steps wedged into rock face and wood plank ladders which had to take enormous time to build and place securely here.  Shoots and Ladders. It is a wonderfully beautiful mountain but hard as hell to make time on.

Hour by hour the sun drops a little lower and we slow in pace.  Tired and ready to make camp we push into the darkness.  Jim leads us into the woods now and we stay close with no headlight on yet.  Easier to keep walking with your eyes adjusting to less light than turning on a headlamp and we feel we are right there any minute.

Is that a tent?  TJ and Jim think they see something. Head lamps on, there's a big wooden ladder...yeah we made it. 8:30pm

Catfish is tucked in his sleeping bag and Patrick is by his tent which is set up in the shelter....humm?  A strange fellow with little current type hiking gear.  Looks to have called this shelter home for a few days.  We get our mats and sleeping bags ready and start supper. Working by headlamp makes everything take longer but we manage to fill our tummies and try not to wake other hikers outside.  

It's been a long hard day but a good day.  Luckily we had no rain, had some pains, but we made Maine.","Trident Col
",Full Goose Shelter,"Jul 10, Mon",14.50
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573670,"After somewhat of a restless night we are up early to tackle the notch.  Chance of rain and we'd sure like to be through it before that.  While getting my pack on I realize I have chaffed my pits.  Laugh you may the others did.  With all the twisting and swaying of my body the pack shifted a lot and has rubbed long raw spots to the front of my armpits. Didn't help that I was a sweaty mess too. Nothing body glide can't fix and I'll wear my short sleeve shirt instead of tank today.  

CrazyHorse is off and gone. Good luck catfish. Who knows we might see ya but we really doubt it. Patrick says he might shoot for Speck Pond Shelter which about 5 miles but first we all must get through The Notch.  

Up and over South Peak it's a sharp rock climb but short and has a nice level board walk through an open ridge with hot pink flowering bushes. Really pretty this morning. We steadily start down wondering when the sign will say the is the beginning of the end....we hear some hikers down below and feel the temperature drop around us.  A sign marks this is it and the south bound hikers say it's one heck of a ride.  I'm smiling now but do dread what's ahead. 

We have picked up a nobo, Little Bear Stumbles.  She is a flip flopper having started in Harper's Ferry and will hike to Katahdin and then flip back to Harper's and hike south to Springer.  She is nervous about the notch too and didn't want to hike it alone.  We are happy to have her with us.  

Jim leads the way as we head into the belly of the beast.   7:40 am I plan to clock our mile and see just how long it takes to get through.  Starting out its a rather normal rock scramble. Step to one rock or around a rock with no need to grab something our use your arms.  We have stowed our sticks so we can use all fours.  

Feeling like someone turned on the air conditioning we notice deep in the crevasses there is leftover snow.  Wow. That's cold.  I can see my breath but I am still sweating.  

After about 20 minutes I am over this work out. I am now at 3 points of contact on all steps using my hands to balance and maneuver rock situations.  My pack pushes me to take care with every step not to fall and its pack pretty light.  Can't image being under 40 pounds of weight in here. 

Reaching the halfway mark, so we assume, the maze turns even more troublesome. Packs off to go thru tight places.  Better get that arm strength working cause it's time to wedge yourself up and out of it.  

By now Anna has worked her way to the front of the line and I'm heading to the back.  Jim takes a place in front of me to help me up areas I just can't step up and over.   Little Bear is moving along well. A tall thin gal packed ultralight she steps across areas I have to drop into and climb out.  TJ is enjoying this monkey room and bops over rocks like a cricket.  All fun and games for the kids.

Meeting hikers going south they encourage we are almost out. We try to do the same on the other direction. Needing s breather we stop for a quick snack and calculate with the wonders of Guthooks (online guide trail giuide) that we are  a few short tenths of making it out.  

Warmth of sun rays begin to shine on us.  The erie cold drops away and we spy the sign say the end is here.  A camp sight is nestled in the perfect location of this finish of entrance however it may be.  I know if I ever come back(which is Not on my bucket list) I would camp on both side of the hellish hike.  It took us 2 hours to walk this longest mile of the AT.  

Now we have the Arm. 

BB and Flo, hiking friends we met last year have told us about what we are into now.  They hiked this already and have said the notch was bad nut the arm is worse.  Now I know why.  Your already beat up and now it's time to pick yourself up and start climbing for 1.5 miles gaining 1200 feet of elevation.  There are no switchbacks, only you face to face with a rock slab heading to the sky.  Oh and it's 80 degrees with full sun on our backs.  

Little Bear has busted on out of here after getting her water and snack.  The party of Four is separating as us old ones head on steadily for the top while TJ is coaching Anna to dig deep.  One step at a time I say.  No stopping. Keep pumping.  Jim looks over his shoulder to check on me. Take a break Martha.  Nope. I'm right here.  Keep hiking. I won't go down.  

Reaching to top we stagger to a place to collapse. You are like a prize fighter taking hits and just won't fall, Jim says to me.  I feel like I've been beaten up for sure.  Bruises are starting to whelp up from hits in the notch and the heels of my hands are raw from catching myself or helping myself around rocks in the labyrinth of hell.   

Stretched out on top of the Mahoosuc Arm we bake in the sun too tired to move onto the shade.  It took us 30 minutes to feel like eating.  The kids showed up, Anna drained and TJ smiling ready for more.  Little shit, stop that smiling.  He eats and giggles at us trying to get ourselves back in order.

After a good rest we load up and head out.  It's a town day guys.   The worst is behind us.  

Speck Pond was our next destination.  Wow and was it beautiful. All the potential of bad weather this morning has blown right out for a blue bird kind of day with high floating clouds above. The pond reflects the sky surrounded with green forest.  A perfect place to snap a photo.  The existing shelter is having some new work. A fine place to camp but we have 4+ miles to go after getting our last hit of water.

Be careful on top of Old Speck,it's all open rock, no place to grab a hand hold a hiker warns.  I've been using trees and whatever I can to mauve up area like this. I'm worried now.  

TJ takes the lead with us girls in the middle and Jim sweeping.  Let's take our time and make sure of footholds and get up this craggy rock.  300 feet of openness. I don't look back, only in front, keeping my eyes on each step TJ takes.  In doing so it is over before I know it and we are capped out.  

Resting on the other side several NoBos come by.  All are pushing for town or their next shelter.  Sequoia, LaserSnake, and McFlurry(a girl). Hiking machines.  The fella are traveling reckless.  One with no phone and the other with no map.  Good thing the chick is close behind to keep them fellas on track.  Maybe they should be following her. 

3 miles to town and it's all down.  Step after step of crazy unruly rock.  Grabbing trees, rebar for footing, it was another work out.  We finally we just had to laugh while playing plinko.  That's when you let your sticks slide down beside rebar steps so you can use all four to climb down.  My knees are aching.

Highlight of the evening came in when we heard from our fifth...Bones.  She is coming in tonight and joining back with our team.  Beer and pizza will be waiting for us she says while flashing a photo from a Portland outside bar. Nice umbrella drink. 

We call Pine Ellis our hostel to line up a shuttle.  We shoot for 7:00 but hope be earlier.  You lay a time out in front of Anna and she'll make sure you make it every time.  The race is on with her on that.  

Down down. I'm moving about as fast as I can without tumbling head over heels.  The closer we come to the road, you always hear it for a while, the less rocky the trail.  Just a lot of pounding down now. 

 Parking lot.  Oh what a good sight. 6:33. Told ya.  TIME!  

We wait for about an hour before Gloria rolls up from Pine Ellis.  The RoadRunner she is called.  She even has her own oxygen tank aboard to out run the Wiley Coyote. Hitting only the high spots in the road she barrels down the 2 lane road talking all the way. Nothing doing but to drive us through town. Which consists of 1 square mile of property.  No traffic light, no law, and no trouble.  3 places to eat that's all we need to know.  Now take us to Bones.

Beer and pizza as promised was waiting on the outside table. Thank you thank you.  We get a quick tour of the hostel from Naomi and we settle like yard art out front.  Time to reconnect with our Texan friend.  The party of five is back.","Full Goose Shelter
",Grafton Notch,"Jul 11, Tue",9.70
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573672,"The smell of coffee wakes me.  Naomi said there would be homemade muffins downstairs each morning.  Our room is just up the stairs off the kitchen and the bath.  Good I can hit both early before the rest of the house converges.  Little Bear is here, she came in a good hour or more before us, has her hiking legs for sure.  Also a few fellas from Virginia too.  They plan to section the next couple of day like us.  We have decided to bump up to hike a 10 mile section a little easier looking so our bodies can recover some.  Every step map profile has us anticipating shit trail of rock scramble and we are ready for a break from this.  Sobo hikers confirm today's hike is easy.

Excited to check out town we take our walk to find breakfast.  The Red Hen calls us in and we are not disappointed.  A perfect town diner serving for every meal they are ready for hikers and their hunger.  Large portions and reasonably priced we have leftovers.  The owner was quite surprised when we asked for boxes, not the norm for a hiker.  We inform we are section hikers and have only been out for 4 days.  Mexican buffet night is tomorrow so y'all come back she says.  Oh we'll be back sooner than that we plan to have breakfast with you again in the morning.

Our shuttle awaits, Gloria is in the cockpit and says call from Moody Mtn to confirm pickup.  You sign up the night before for shuttle departure time and pickup. We are on the mid morning shuttle and to be picked up at 4:00.

What a good day for a hike.  Perfect conditions. Well still,very hot but I will take that over rain any day.  What is this?  Path, dirt, leaves, a trail not laden with rock.  We have Wyman Mountain to summit and it has a long looking top with no peaks or cols. YES!

Graded nicely we meander up the trail having manageable roots to step around.  Bones is feeling the effects of the first day out but is packed light for slacking.  We are all glad to be on this side of the trail.

At Surplus Pond we run across a gals group of about 15.  They are taking a breather and all smiles to be here.  Canadian accents of most so I throw out some southern twang to see if it can be interpreted. Guess it worked one took our group picture.  

Cresting Wyman it was hardly recognized it was so gradual.  Tall undergrowth encroaches the trail so you can see your footing.  That's ok it was all path.  Now if it had been raining we'd been soaked through.  

Before long we see the shelter roof, Hall Mtn Lean-to.  Perfect lets eat.  We have hiked the majority of our day and all before lunch.  That's my kind of hike. 

Some hikers come our way...Peaches! TJ says, is that you?  I don't believe it.  Peaches hiked part of the AT last year before getting Lymne disease and coming off in PA.  We met him coming into Vermont, he was SOBOing.  He is back now for a thru hike north.  Said once he hit PA (which finished his last yr part) he just kept going.  His big smile was nice to see along with his friends....Downhill, Puddin, Slappy(a gal)
and another. 

Four more miles and one Moody Mtn to climb.  The down off was a lot of steps between steep grades of sloping trail.  My knee is barking.  Right one.  It always tightens up and hurts. Old age creeping in.  You guys go one I will be right along. I can't quick step this.  

Sawyer brook roars below, we have a ford.  TJ and Anna scout for rock hopping passage but don't see much.  I take off my shoes and pull out insoles and socks off.  Will try this method and see how it works.  With gortex shoes the water will just run over and in and then I can pour out on the other side.  Safe passage for all, it wasn't very deep. Having 2 1/2 miles to walk in wet shoes isnt too bad.  We'll just have to walk them dry.

the climb over Moody was fairly uneventful. Talking and hiking make for quick miles.  Bones is keeping a quick pace and Anna keeps close eye on that clock.  Hey we can make the shuttle by 3. Let's call and bump up are says.  Naomi answers my call and says that can be done.  The race is on.  

Step, rock, trail, down down.  These gals are pushing me but I'm getting it done.  Note Anna is ultra light, no pack...TJ carried for 2. Jim is in runners mode with his fanny pack for snacks and bottle of water in his pocket.  This party of five is on the move.

The sound of road couldn't come any quicker.  Again we hear it for a good 1/2 mile.  Rock steps down to another ford?  Yep Black Brook.  And they are tons camping here.  
I can see David our shuttle guy just across the way.  Right on time. No need in keeping shoes dry now...let's enjoy this wade. 

David's van is geared out for hikers...plastic covers the seats and he has heavy lug floor mats for catching dirt.  He is Native American with long thick black hair, sporting his head band and homemade jewelry. 'I hear your group 2 miles away' he says....'You see no Moose'.  Yes we are a load group kept up with SlimJims booming voice and constant audio.  

Back at Pine Ellis we enjoy our early afternoon arrival.  First time I've felt ahead of schedule this trip.  Cold beer, leftover pizza and some ice for my knee please.  We plan to order burgers from the Andover convenience store for supper. But for now let's enjoy our table for five and plan to do it all again tomorrow.","East B Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573788,"From the moment we decided to switch up days to hike our two 10 mile slack days I’ve been wondering did we make the right decision.  We needed an easier day yesterday, it sure felt good to feel good on the trail. Not like the trail was beating me up.  It was a blue bird day and I loved it. Now…we have rain coming in. It began last night earlier than expected. I heard it on the roof and all I could see was us sliding off Baldpate Mountain. Ten miles with 2300 feet to climbing in not the best conditions has me a little worried. Pray for us ya’ll….


Riding in the front seat with David I begin to ask questions of what to expect up there. I can see the weather hanging over the mountain range we drive toward. He has hiked all the trail in their servicing area so he can have the real trail knowledge to pass along.  “You guys stay close up there, you will be above treeline and for sure will be foggy.  I say bet it’s windy up there… Always wind up there.”  He encourages me saying the north bound direction is the better of the two ways to hike it.  The profile looks quite daunting and our friend BB fell and broke her arm up there last year on her trek to Katahdin…Good news to-date is she and Flo finished this year, summiting Big K. Whoop Whoop.

One last word of caution before David drives off.…don’t cross Dunn Falls at the blazes.  Be sure and go up stream a ways and cross. If you lose footing there you won’t go over the falls. I’ll see you on the other side…of the road… he smiles.  Wew I thought he was saying THE other side...Indian mystic aura. 

Raincoats on but dressed for sweating we are in shorts. I’ve packed my puffy jack and emergency blanket for just in case of emergency. Take a fall and if it is raining, 50 degrees and wind, will feel like 40 and hypothermia.  Burrrr.

Excited to be slacking we are all packed light again. Jim only has his fanny pack with no extra layers, just a buff for head warmth and a power bar. Water in pocket again he is our ultra-lightest. Anna does bring her pack today. If anything it will keep her warmer too. 

Good trail is my first thought as we begin our climb. Steps well laid for normal strides are great. Dosen’t hurt knees near as bad. Anna has provided some precautionary tape on my right knee; little did I know that left would be the one that begins to bite today.

Jim leads us to our first snack stop Baldpate Lean-to.  Anna is feeling weak needing food and I’m ready for something as well.  Not only food but some Vitamin I.  Bones checks her medical kit and serves up the magic dosage. No setting down, just stand and snack, too wet at the moment.  Luckily it’s not a pouring rain just a wet ass day. I have my pit zips open and jacket unzipped most of the way, warm.

Rock slab trail under foot and we are really starting upward now, treeline will be broken shortly. Fog engulfs. Wind picks up as we break out of the trees. Stay close folks. Rock cairns lead the way. I keep my eyes on Jim and look for blazes such as they are…on the ground rock isn’t the best but hey it does let you know you are on the trail.  

Now climbing up on wet rock isn’t great but better than going down it. Keeping my feet staggered on the side hills and tiny steps on the down side hill I feel my knees tighten up. Glad I don’t have a full pack. We did run into several SOBOs loaded down and man did they look warn but in good spirits.  Feeling too confident on one section stepped just a bit too wide and bam, ass bustin. That’s gonna leave a mark. I’m bruised up already so what’s one more gonna matter. Anna and TJ are close behind me running sweeper for this big girl. Easy Big Dawg.  

Bones and Jim both have orangish jackets making easier to spot in and out of this fog waives. I see them stopped on a very steep slope going up…what’s up? A young gal is setting down with a bag over her hands….Jim’s grocery bag?? Bone’s is blocking the wind from her and assessing if injury. She is just scared after taking a slip and sees nothing but straight down ahead of her.  Too cold to be here for any amount of time we coach her to her feet and encourage that she will be ok, treeline isn’t far ahead and her other hiking friends are very close. And more were just behind her too, we met then on top of East Peak. 

Ah East Peak, that’s were our fun begins. Down down. Shit this isn’t hiking it’s repelling worthy.  Tippy toeing my legs are tight tight. White knuckling my sticks. Rebar and wooden steps to manage and then finally a rope to work our way down to steps again. This is no joke, one slip and you’ll wind up in a pretzel. 

Treeline couldn’t get close soon enough but then that just means rock with trees lining the path to try and grab a hold of for security.  Wrapping my arms around trees and stepping down backwards to elevate the stress on my lower body.  The left knee is hollering for relief.  I’ve switched to it to help with the right and now both are a barking. 

Finally down amongst the forest again we settle into Frye Notch Shelter for lunch. Two other hikers are eating too. Dressed more for this weather they are full on rain gear. Jim slides into the back of the shelter and soon is shivering. Just keep talking Jim that will warm this place up. He is entertaining our two who are eating a warm meal. Nice.  We’ll have that soon enough back at the hostel. We tell them we plan on getting a ride at the road and will be calling to confirm from Surplus mtn just ahead.  

Let’s get warm ya’ll…the hike up didn’t take long to do just that. It was rather easy and short too compared to all else.  Wow we are starting down, let me make our call.  Glad to hear we are on schedule for pick up Naomi says David will be there.  All about making that time Anna is asking the time each mile.

The weather has broken and we see some clearing up above. Good trail off the rest of the mountain and we draw close to the roar of Dunn Falls. Our minds race with wonder of what is below. It sounds loud. How long is the crossing I wonder? The fellas have gone ahead on down to check out our best location to cross. We all look in aw over the view point at the rushing water through the gauntlet. David was right don’t cross here, a blaze on either side of the torrent. Jim and TJ have walked up stream and found a good location for us to navigate. TJ of course has his eyes on some rocks he feels he can hop across and Anna follows his lead.  I am next to cross (Bones and Jim already on the safe side). Jim comes back in half way to meet me, taking my pack and lending a hand just in case.  Your knee may give in this current, grab a hold.  Thank you thank you. 
Stomping up the next hill and back down to just go back up we are ready to see David. He laughs aswe  jump from the woods. Good thing his van has those plastic covered seats, we are wet.  Wew what a day but we made it, thanks for all your pointers, they were spot on. You guys made good time out there he says. All smiles we are ready for some refreshment and our night at the Red Hen.

The Red Hen, the best and only full on restaurant in Andover is having Mexican buffet night. Come early she told us yesterday morning when we were in for breakfast. You can count on that.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573810,"Time to say goodbye to the ladies at Pine Ellis and get one last drive to the trail from David. It’s been a pleasure meeting you and who knows maybe we’ll be this way to see you again someday. I do love your little town. TJ could be principal of your 35 student school. 


Old Blue is ahead of us. A big arss climb from town is an always. One only knows how many ladders this mountain will have.  Our packs our loaded back up for a 2 day trek to Rangeley and we’ll have a scheduled full zero = no miles to hike day. Even with our slack days we’ve been hiking 5 straight days and this will make 7. That’s a lot for us section hikers. 

The first hour I really feel the stress in the legs and the weight of my pack. Even packing fairly light it is noticeable. The twinge in my left knee is working to a point of giving out on some steps. Starting out lead doggin may be working back to second seat if this persists. Jim is close behind me feeling his weight too. Bones is at her first full pack day of the trip. We all know what that feels like.

Mile and a half in the wooden ladders begin and Old Blue starts to kick in. This hot and humid day doesn’t help with the climb. Jim gives me a hand over a few big steps and we finally hit the tippy top, 3600 feet. I’m ready for first lunch and will get some knee adjustment. KT tape is my friend.

A familiar voice comes in to join us, Hellooo Me Hiiiking Friends, its Highlander. How ya been? He looks great but is missing his hiking friend. After her knee went out he has had to get himself in a better place to hike. Motivation is everything. A big smile on his face is good to see. He is headed for Bemis Lean To having already hike 7 miles this morning. Tough man he his. We hope to make it past there and camp shy of Rt. 17 say about 12 miles today.  Sabbath Shelter would be a we bit of a push at 17. 

The hike off old Blue wasn’t too bad but with my knees ailing was way too much work. Elephant mountain which was more like a knoll provided a nice bench seat for me. The crew allowed me the best seat in the house since getting back up from the ground takes two. What a wonderful view. Maybe I’ll just camp here I joke. Both knees are taped now and a second dose of Vitamin I has been administered. Oh and my feet are doing great.  Not a pain in this world. What the heck?

Easing over Bemis Mounain we have 3 peaks to come off down to our possible camp spot with Bemis LeanTo on the way. In the back of my mind I know that’s where I need to stop for the night. I will push all I can but this down will be a tough one. Clouds begin to gather as we approach third peak which is our first of the three.  Rain uhhh we don’t want to set up camp in the rain. 3:30. Talk among us all turns to sheltering as those sprinkles begin to fall.

Highlander is already here and set up and many others. Let’s hope the shelter has room. Only one is here so we take mark our places with our mats. Shelter holds 8 so we are good. Water is close to the shelter and Jim retrieves a platypus full for icing a knee. Two more hiker gals come in and we now have our 8 inside. Rain showers come and go till just about dusk and then it starts to set in more. So glad we aren’t still trying to hike off of range and finding camp at o’dark thirty. 

Pretty tired and getting cooler we all slide into our sleeping bags and talk rest till time to fall asleep. Several more hikers come and go looking in the shelter for room then 2 come asking if we can make room. A tall fellow with a gal hiker both are soaked.  Pleading his case to make room, we do so for one more and he give the spot to her.  (unbeknownst to us this is Rooster and Trippin, who you will read more about soon)  She is quite while getting her bunk ready and out of wet clothes ready to eat her supper in the dark.  

A restless night it was for me. I couldn’t get comfortable at all. My new mat is wonderful though. It kept me warm and doesn’t make me feel like I am rolling off. But my knees never could get comfortable lying stretched out or on my side.  I woke up one time and was spooning Anna as we were in quite the close quarters. I finally took some medicine to ease the pain and drifted off with the last of the rain.","South Arm Road-Andover

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573904,"Waking up sort of groggy I hear our northbound hikers packing up and getting ready for another full day.  The three gals are efficiently quick packing their gear while either heating their food or eating while they pack. Then eating something else again before putting their packs on to go. 

My crew gets ourselves ready for our day but just how far can I go I think to myself. Rangeley is the ultimate goal 17.7 miles away. Not making it farther yesterday puts more pressure to get these in. The other option is to pull up at a shelter in 8.3 or some other camp spot but that isn’t appealing, town is the prize. We have a road crossing in 4.5 miles. I will reserve decision till then.

The forest lays heavy with dampness from last night’s rain. Air this thick and fog hangs over. Second and First Peak are in front of us before a long down to an old railroad bed and steam ford.  All I can do is hike and see how far my legs take me. 

Wet rock trail takes us over the first mile and a slight up to Second Peak. Every step up my left knee gives more and more OUT. Just no push in it any more. Jim helps me with every awkward step up lending a hand and a heave ho.  I know in the back of my mind this can’t go on for 17 miles. 

Going down the peak with little confidence in the legs the feet fly out from under and WAM, another elbow drive and ass bustin!  From there the rest gets blurry like and out of body experience. Every step  on First Peak is pain and I collapse to a rock in almost tears. That’s it! It is time to call for pick up at the road and let me team continue on without me. Jim instructs all to grab a piece of my gear to lighten my pack and I call The Farmhouse hostel in Rangeley. They will be there as soon as possible, no rush folks I have 2 more miles to cover. 

It was the hardest 2 miles I’ve ever walked and not because the trail was hard or I was hurting. It was because I was giving up. I was quitting. I have NEVER quite anything in my life. I am too competitive for that. Mad and fighting back tears of sadness the road is reached. A busy highway with a large pull off area for overlooking Mooselookmeguntic Lake. (no that is not a misspelling)  

On the last walk in the crew talked about what was best next. hike on, come off with me, slack to Rangeley? We have a zero planned for tomorrow anyways. Maybe I could bounce back after that? Bones double checks with me that I will be ok alone and gives me instruction to ice asap and elevate. Boy my doctor bill is going up by the minute. 

Gear is sorted back out and now I have everyone’s stuff. They will slack pack on to Rangeley, 13.2 more miles. Leaving just shy of noon that’s a big day to pull off before dark so you guys gotta get. 

Waiting on the guard rail I look like and poor wounded sole having a gear sale. Packs here, get your packs right here. Passing the time waiting on my rescue shuttle I wonder down to talk with all the sight seers. Chatting with one family from Germany who were very interested in the trail and my story of hiking it now and over the years. I also teamed up with a group of cyclists too. Tricycle motor bikers touring. They had one lone rider who needed a good woman to shout in his ear of what to do. Yep that could have been me.

A truck pulls in and says are you the hiker that needs a ride? Do you need medical attention? He was most helpful getting all our gear loaded and offered to lift me in his truck. I got it thank you.  He is the son of the Farmhouse owners, Stacy and Shaun. Trained for wilderness rescue he tells me of already helping out 6 hikers this season and all of them didn’t walk out. Glad I didn’t make that list. 

After our stop at the local grocery on the way into town I get settled into our party of five room in the house.  A big farmhouse with an owners section and then the hostel part built on. We are in the upstairs area and have a bath in our room. Very convenient.  

After a hot shower I find my way back outside to the patio area. Trout helps me with my crews gear and serves up my ice packs and keeps my cold drinks coming while propping up my legs. It was a long afternoon waiting on my hiking friends to reconnect with me. Thankfully Trout and Zigzag helped pass the time. Trout is a SOBO hiker having stopped for a while here working for stay while some gear arrives for him. Zigzag is just that a hiker zigging and zagging from one part of this trail or another to another. 

Rangeley Lake sets just across the road from the house. I find a spot where I can see part of it while watching the sun fall farther from the sky. Hope my team is ok. I text to see if by chance a message might get through. Nothing….  So Trout will they be able to get a ride easily? Oh yes, hitchhiking will get them here no problem he assures. 

Another hiker comes in, Flicker. She and her husband Gandalf are NOBO sectioning. They had to change their plan of hiking the AT when Flicker was diagnosed intestinal cancer. And when he started having hip troubles. Within 4 days of having her cemo port removed she was back on the trail doing Long Ass Sections (LASHER) while he began running shuttle to and from the trail. They have bounced up the trail from state to state so she can finish before Sept and she can complete her THRU hike within one calendar year. They are a great team and you will see how we fall into their forever indebtedness. 

Closing in on 6:00 I figure it’s about time I figure something out for first dinner for my crew and for me. I check in with Stacy to see what are my options. She pulls out frozen pizzas from her frig that I can cook up. Perfect. Also we give a shuttle to town if you need later. Even more perfect. 

The waiting is killing me and I’ve iced about all I can for today. Then finally a red car rolls up and familiar faces shine through the windows.  They have made it. Steve from The Hiker Hut has shuttled them here. He is the owner there and a great person known along the trail. Gandalf pulls back up from a road run and has the gal that had come in late from the rain and spent the night in the last shelter, Trippin.
They are making extra room for her in the basement. 

Here guys have a piece of pizza and a cold beer, tell me all about it. They say it was the easiest miles hiked this trip. Man and I missed it. Of course lots of mud and bogs but easy miles. Zero day tomorrow folks let’s get you cleaned up and head to town for some real grub.","Bemis Mtn Lean-to

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573987,"Last night’s meal at Sarge’s was filled with burgers, fries and their specialty, seafood chowder. It hit the spot. Trippin joined us and caught us up on her adventure. It was Karaoke night but we didn’t participate. Probably should have they’d never known the difference. Bad bad singing. My team was pretty tired after their big day and a late night wasn’t in the stars.

The morning brought some tension. Uncertainty of my progression at this point has us on edge. Questions of should I stay or should I go are in the air. We have a day to figure it out. Stratton is the next town to walk to which is planned for a 3 day trip. Ideas of doing it in 2 days are concerning to me. I know I can’t walk it in that time and not sure even if I bump up to that town to meet them I’ll even be ready to hike from there. Bones has offered to stay along with me in any case which is nice but I hate to knock her out of miles she needs to hike too. Decisions decisions…

Early morning Highlander comes in from the trail. So good to see him again. He will resupply and hike back out tomorrow. Trippin is taking a day as well waiting on her supply box to come into Stratton. She plans to hike south from there tomorrow.  Zigzag is packing his gear ready to head back out today. Gandalf has the truck ready to take Flicker back out to hike another section. She will return this eve. The Farmhouse is a swinging door of activity.

We get our shuttle downtown for breakfast and then take a  leisurely walk thru town. Rangeley is surrounded by lakes with coves backing up to various spots to enjoy.  Finding chairs to set and watch the water fowl come and go was a real nice change of pace. Maybe we can rent a boat for a water trip Bones says. Or maybe a float plane to take us on a tour while the rest hike. Her mind is racing with ideas to help bring my spirits up and take advantage of a course not planned for. Still in the back of my mind I want to think I could begin hiking after more days of rest. I just don’t know.

Back at the hostel we lounge around outside talking to other hikers coming and going. Highlander has been eating since we left and is on second breakfast when we return. Shoot I could eat my leftover hamburger myself.  Let’s have a beer over it while I ice my knees.  I browse my maps and Bones and I continue to bounce ideas around for jumping back on the trail at one place and another. This area looks pretty flat.  How long can you hike Martha? I don’t know. Here are out roads for in case. How can we get there? Where will the other be at that time? So many contingencies.  Ya’ll just go to Stratton and we’ll be there in 2 days Jim says. Anna and TJ smile, we’ll be there!

Bones makes a fine suggestion… Martha let’s take walk up to the food store. If you can walk that little grade with little stress or pain then we’ll know more. Perfect I get my shoes and am excited to prove what I can do. She takes out on a regular walking pace. I’d normally even walk a little faster actually but this is very uncomfortable and I’m only on a grades paved road. I shorten and then lengthen the stride to see if anything changes. Pain level is accessed from 1-5, 5 being the worst. I’d say slight 4 not the pain I’d like test on any climbs we’ve already experienced. Afraid to jeopardize my crews next few days I make the call to bow out and regroup with them in Stratton. 

Nothing left to do now but go an eat supper. We head for The Red Onion. I love Italian. Setting at the large table in the back we have the room to ourselves, a good 10 of us. One hiker orders the kitchen sink pizza. It had to weigh 5 pounds, covered with every topping you can think of and then anything fried that you can think of. Crazy thick. Eggplant parmesan for me and keep those beers a coming I’m drowning my sorrows to night. 

Nothing doing before leaving town that an ice cream stop made. Anna is dying for her 2 scopes. The other hikers join in too. Trout plans to have a fire in the back yard pit tonight. So we head back for some last minute packing the party of 3 now needs to make before they pull out tomorrow. 

Stars fill the sky, I can almost reach up and touch them. The workers here have joined us fireside and music fills the night air. Bones shares her marshmallows with all. You can’t have a fire and not roast a mellow. TJ gets his turn on the guitar sharing his homemade songs and picking skills. Watch out Eric Gress.  

Our zero day draws to a close, its way past hiker midnight and for all those heading out in the morning it time to get your rest.","Rangeley

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574064,"Morning comes with more angst. Discussion is heavy with uncertainty. Will I be ready to hike in 2 more days? Does it make sense for them to push for Stratton in 2 days instead of 3? Should Bones and I stay here, go to Stratton now, plan for town adventures, plan to hiking farther up the trail? Tears well up in my eyes as it is time to rally my team with words of encouragement and to not worry about me right now, it’s time to hike and get there safely. 

Seeing them off was just about as hard as coming from the trail the other day. Gandalf has already left to get Flicker to her starting point. Her niece is in to hike the next 2 days with her since this section is too far to slack. They will camp out and end up in Stratton too. Highlander has left as well; he took the early shuttle out.  Trippin is awaiting Gandalf return and will be getting a shuttle up to Stratton and hiking south back to Rangeley and then we get transport back to Stratton and continue north.  

Bones and I get a ride to town for breakfast with two other hikers we had supper with last night. Food was fine, town was fine, but I really don’t want to be here. My mind is on the trail and doing whatever miles I might be able to do while in Maine. I’ve come too far and planned too much to be wasting my time or money on “filler”. I am on vacation so let’ enjoy it for what it is. 

After returning to the Farmhouse I get my maps and start planning with Bones. We could bump to Caratunk our original scheduled ending point, use the B&B there as home base and hike south from it and then north to get as many miles as we can while here for the next 5 days. Gandalf we need a ride!!

Keeping the roads hot and the hikers happy, Gandalf loads up our gear along with Trippin. Trout is coming too as a navigator. He is some familiar with the area and will map out the trip from Rangeley to Stratton for a PO stop for Trippin and I will drop my teams leftover bounce boxes at the Stratton motel. Then we’ll have a long ride (unbeknownst to us at the time) on the back logging roads to Caribou Valley where Gandalf will recon the rendezvous with his wife. Then we’ll ride on to Caratunk where he’ll drop us off and leave Trippin’s bounce box. 

Thanks so much Stacy, Ashley and Sky, you ladies at the Farmhouse have been wonderful. I’ll see you next year when I come back to finish the Saddleback Range and the Bigelows. 

Excited to be back on track I don’t even care how long this drive is taking. It was country roaden with friends. All we need is a truck bed full of people and beer and instead of hiking gear. Civilization if totally lost as we get deeper and deep in the wilderness. Car trouble is dead in the water type situation. No cell service. You have to be self-sufficient. 

Several hours later we arrive in Caratunk. The Kennebec River runs beside the highway, a large moving body of water. We have to cross this by canoe, I am curious what that will be like. We plan to so in the morning. The B&B is tucked off the one and only road thru town. Population 63. And no cell service, did I mention that already?

Hikers are everywhere.  Its early afternoon and milkshakes are flowing. Everyone up and down the trail had been talking about them. We will have to get one. But first let’s get checked in. Paul is the owner, cook and registrar. The house is an old wooden home with two stories and no always. You know one room just leads into the next with rooms off in little nooks. We are shown to our upstairs room, two beds and a shared pass thru bath. Very antiquey and homey.  

With our whirlwind departure this morning we haven’t had lunch so we put an order in with Paul for bbq sandwiches, his second known menu item. We visit with Boulder who works here. He has hiked the trail and comes for 4 months during hiking season and helps out with shuttles and housekeeping. We tap in on his trail knowledge as well as Paul’s for our now planned 3 day adventure.

Let’s stretch our legs a bit Bones suggests. Good idea. I get my shoes on and we head for the trail to see what we see. First we go south from the house down to the river. The trail runs right by it and to ferryman’s post. He has a nice large privy and porch and then an area to chain up his boat and a tarp covered sign in spot. The river is super calm now, guess the damn isn’t releasing water today. Returning back we then go north for just a bit before the trail turns more upward. Let’s save this for another day and check out ‘town’. 

Ah yes town, an few houses, a post office and a one room school that was just recently closed after the number of students dropped to 2.  A little fella is outside the PO with his mom pulling the mail wagon. We introduce ourselves to his mom and she says the family comes here for the summer, couple of months, it gets cold early. Then they return to Home home, which is another small town away.  Most folks in this little community do this.  She works at the Kennebec River Pub. Cool we’ll see you there soon I’m sure. 

Tonight we get our gear ready to head back on the trail. Packing light as we can. No stove, no extras, taking my tent only for emergency, plan to stay in 2 shelters along the way which both are set by ponds so hope this is a dreamy as it sounds. We have conversed with Neal and Bangor, both of which are SOBOs and have already come by this stretch. Paul also says very good trail to test the knees and there are a couple of road crossing in case I run into trouble. 

I text my crew on the mountain and let them know where we are, where we’re going and hoping they are doing well.  They have made contact with us via text as well and send a photo from Saddleback Mountain. Highlander has been spotted along their way too. This makes me feel so much better.
Everyone is now hiking their own hike.","Rangeley

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574078,"Is that bacon I smell? Coffee? Paul has breakfast going early. You can get coffee at 5:30 if you wish but breakfast isn’t served till 7:00. You have a place set for you at the main dining table so don’t be late or you’ll lose some of what’s coming to ya on the first pass. French toast,  a huge veggie omelet topped with fresh sliced tomatoes,  fried taters, sliced banana,  juice and BACON. 

Neal, Bangor and Which Way are with us this morning. Neal has been here a day or so and seems to be taking his time along the trail enjoying down time and photography. Bangor has come off the trail after a SOBO attempt that just wasn’t working out. The pain of Maine is felt my friend. Which Way is a lady who loves her hiking.  She has already hiked the trail and is out just doing a repeat section she loves. A table full of ‘seasoned’ hikers. I have officially fallen into this category, OLD.  Bones is our youngest seated, who knew.

Having all day to hike our 4 miles we don’t rush but I am anxious to get back on the trail.  We have to close clear out of our room but can leave not needed supplies in the barn room until our return on Thursday.  We have Boulder lined up for shuttle, pick up 11:00am at East Flagstaff Road.  I text Anna one more time to make sure they know our plans and she is blowing up my phone already asking about their upcoming trail and town info. It’s good to still be needed from afar. That’s what Lead Dog, have the details.  

Pack on, stepping into the woods felt good.  The Kennebec rolls softly this morning. Fog hangs over us making for an erie look that really wasn’t. No real weather forecasted today but it can look like rain at any time in Maine. We are the first of the day to need transport. Passage is only provided between the hours of 9am and 2:00pm.  Our ferryman Greg is setting on the river bank having his last bite of breakfast. Just sign this waiver he instructs and put this lifejacket on. He places our packs in the boat and asks who would like to paddle up front and who wants the princess seat? I’ve heard about the princess seat, I’ll take that!  Bones takes the front and man’s our ship. Greg settles to the back and gives us a push and off we go. A white blaze in the bottom of the boat marks this as the official route of the AT.  No need to ford and chance life and limb.  Many hikers have crossed before a ferry and a few have perished.  I am glad it was a most calming journey across this channel. 2 hikers await their turn on the south side. They wave us in. 
Thank you Mr. Ferryman you’ve just made my day.

Bones leads us up the trail which is most rooted. But we’re used to this by now, just now big ass rocks please. Large forest surrounds us but different than the dense woods from what we’ve been in. Otter pond runs parallel to us with the trail almost stepping in the edge of it. Big roots and some scramble up and around to a waterfall. We don’t go out to the edge but can see and hear it plenty. 

Mushrooms and heavy greenery grow. Fibrant green moss lines our wide FLAT path now. Where has this been? Flat lush, soft cushy trail. It only lasts for a minute but wow it was is nice. 
 
Hardwoods take over and the woods seem to open a bit more. More light can pass down to us, leaving that feeling of being swallowed up behind. Signs appear for Harrison’s camp. Oh we’ve heard of this place and are planning to sign up for his big breakfast in the morning. Had we been on our original schedule this was planned for a last morning on the trail and a big celebration to walk out to the Kennebec. Guess Bones and I will just have to celebrate early.  Wooden walk ways have been built on the two paths to his camp. Hey look up there, that must be his house, then Which Way shows up. She’s been walking in circles around this area trying to find the ‘by pass’ around the dam ahead. Dam? I don’t remember reading about a dam. Another hiker we met this morning was tell us to be careful walking across it. HUM..wonder what is in store?

Come on gal you can walk over that dam with us. We have to go this way too. We’ll be safer in numbers. Turns out it is a wooden dam built on the lower side of Pierce Pond. Locals have kept it up readying tells us and then the ATC and forestry sorta go involved but to tell you the truth looks like it was stacked up some years ago and it is what it is now. Sketchy.  A hard rain storm and I’m sure this would over flow the trail. By the looks of the surroundings below here that has happened before.

Not more than a few minutes the shelter sign appears and we have arrived at destination. Lunch time!  Which Way joins us and we talk gear.  She is out for another week and then back to home to plan another adventure. We have this place to ourselves for now…..

Our shelter sets within a stone’s throw from the pond. We might have to go for a swim, Which Way has warned us the rocks are slick next to the bank so be careful, take a friend down with you. 

We notice a dock over by that wooden damn we walked across…hum, might be a good place for a swim?
Nothing doing but we go check it out. I remembered seeing a path which might cut over to it and it does with a little bush whacking. This must be where Mr. Harrison docks his boats and look there’s a little out building here too. 

Cannonball time baby!!!  Just kidding I’m a chicken in deep water….I ease off the edge and slip off into the pond. Ahhh this is sooo nice. It’s cold as shit but nice. We lay on the dock and wonder how Anna and the Boys are doing. Maybe we should send them a picture of this fine spot.   A storm can be heard off ahead so we don’t stay as long as we’d liked and decide best to head on back to camp.

Collecting fire wood is the next mission. We gonna have a fire tonight. Will keep the bugs away.  Picked pretty clean we have to venture a bit to find good tender but come up with some good sources. We have a SOBO who’s come into camp too. She is from the UK. Her name is Grounded, for falling on the ground  a lot. Humm I should be called Bust Ass. She has tight on that have wonder woman on them…say I have your cape.   Yes I brought my super hero cape from the home. It gave me super powers up till we went into Machoosuc notch so I should pass this along so she can use. Tickled to have a piece of trail fun I give her my magic.

Grounded needs to get water and we need to sign up for breakfast tomorrow. Gotta do that at Harrison’s by 6pm the night before. So Bones and Grounded decide to make the .3 walk over to register. I’ll just enjoy this little spot in the sun down here by the pond.  Most relaxing part of any hike I’ve ever been on. Loons come and go, fish nip at the top of the water, and me just me by myself watching nature live around me. 
Soon a big wilderness group comes in. So much for the quite time. LOL  They are going to tent and the trip masters shelter with us. Perfect. There were a lot of kids. Good kids. All out for 7 weeks and this is week 2 I believe. They are excited to go swimming and have their dinner.

They begin their cooking while I get our fire going before the sun goes down. Yes TJ would be proud as this gal got those twigs burning and hot coals cooking. 
Us gals slip back down to the ponds edge and catch the colorful sky reflect on the water. Golden hour. It was magical. Good to be back hiking and camping with friend and enjoying the best of both worlds","Caratunk (South)

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574396,"Last night was a tad buggy. I normally don’t wear a head net to bed but did and it wasn’t to keep my hair in place. The shelter slept full but not crammed.  I rained a tad during the night but not enough to keep me awake. We have a breakfast to get to so we’ll get packed up as quite as we can and head over.

Crossing the Harrison Bridge I can already smell bacon. The girls had a nice visit with him yesterday afternoon and heard about the history of this secluded sportsman camp. He sold out of his business as a young man (said he’d been living here for 30 years) and bought this mountain home and property. It was originally built by a wealth senator who rented it out to his dignitaries.  A large main lodge with an open main seating and dining area has a wraparound porch overlooking the inlet stream to Pierce Pond. A kitchen is off to the side and to the back of that is Tim’s living area. He says he feeds close to a 1000 people a year including hikers and sportsman who come to stay. There are several separate cabins to rent and by the looks of things you’d have to be trucked in, there was only a rough narrow logging road. A hunter’s paradise and a hiker’s heaven. 

Patriotic Pancakes, order up! A 12 stack, filled with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. Bones had placed my order with sausage and 2 eggs over easy. Perfect!  I was way more than I could get so when the young wilderness crew came in I spotted the tallest thinnest fella I’d plan to give my leftovers too. Watching him devour his stack I knew I had picked the right candidate. Grounded and Bones put a pretty good dent in theirs and shared as well.

Have a long hiking day we don’t loaf around too much longer. We have 10.5 miles today. Map doesn’t look that bad and we hear it is a cake walk but in mud. HA that’s Maine.

Grounded heads off in front of us and is gone before we reach our first ridge of the day. This is nothing compared to last week. It actually resembles hiking instead of rock climbing. A very nicely built footbridge provided portage across a wide large bog area. Moose, Mr Moose, where are you?

Following around several water ways we soon come to East Carry Pond, we’ve been hearing of hikers camping by a sandy beach here. Uhh don’t think I would. We could see leaches in the water’s edge and there wasn’t much space between the water and the trail which backed right into the undergrowth. We ran into Downhill and Tator here. That means Peaches must be close again. Tator (she) is pushing to finish by a set date, has a Boston baseball game to celebrate with. 

Black mud thickens but I am thankful for this fairly easy walking. My knees are holding up fine and we are moving along very well. It is our hottest day yet. I look forward to a swim this eve.  

In and out of dry to muck we wonder how our party of 3 is doing. So I check in during a lunch stop. Anna says they are pushing for town as planned and she missing hiking with us girls. We feel the same way. Highlander is bumping around them too which is good to hear. She get more town details from me making sure they have rooms, shuttle and contact info for the motel. All is set Lead Dog’s got you covered. 

Early afternoon and we are closing in on our shelter or we hope. I have to say I am ready to call it a day. West Carry Pond is to our right, we follow alongside a good half a mile. Sure hope we have the same vantage point as yesterday, a shelter overlooking the pond was quite pleasant. And a swim sure would be nice, it’s been very humid. Then a sign appears but we’re walking away from the pond, shoot. 

An older fella has set up his bunk in the shelter; his name was Fox from Michigan.  He is a section hiker too finishing up his section tomorrow.  His been hiking along time and wants to finish before his body gives out…hummm my thoughts exactly.  How’s the swimming I ask, he hasn’t been down to investigate. Come on we’re headed in. 

Well it wasn’t  all that. No easy access into the water. Lots of rocks to manage and very shaded so I was in and out pretty quickly. Cold cold but refreshing. Hearing boats way off we hope one will come this way and bring trail magic like the big plastic tub said at the shelter. Apparently a person(s) who live across the pond boat over periodically and bring goodies. The only thing left on our arrival was an empty box-o-wine and some dog treats.  

More and more hikers come in. Sobos mostly and they are traveling in a happy pack. Stopping for the day way before a NOBO would consider they are ready to set up their tents, go swim and eat. While cooking our known NOBOs arrive, Trippin,  LaserSnake, Sequoia and McFlurry. They are hiking machines and only want to eat so they can hike some more. They have come over the Bigelows and still looking to hike more miles. Trippin fills her wrap up with refried beans she unloaded from cans in town, sprinkled with goldfish. I gather everyone’s trash and offer to carry out. Hey I’m only walking 5.5 miles tomorrow. Give me all you have. 

We say good bye again and wish them well to Katahdin.  

Loons sound off their nightly song as the sun fades thru the trees. No watching the sunset for us tonight. We are tucked in our bags after a successful hiking day. I am thankful to be here and look forward to reuniting with the rest soon.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574418,"We had a late arrival in the shelter last night…Zebra…she is Polish and we just did meet her at The Farmhouse and shared some of our food. Her name comes from the weird tan lines she now has from taping up her knees and legs. She tried to be quite setting up her bed enclosed by a bug net that attached to the inside of the shelter. Was quite the contraption and she was restless all night along side of me. I tossed as well and finally got more sound to sleep close to day break. Anxious for our walk out and already wakened by others I go ahead and start packing up too. 

Fox is up and at’em too. He has a schedule ride as well. Our ride is at 11:00 so we plan to be hiking by 7 just for good measure. I can’t count on doing 2 miles an hour up here so planning for the worst. We’ve been told no worries that once we get out of the muck here by the pond that are 2 climbs but not bad.

It’s another hot day. Glad to be heading for shower. We hear from our group again…they have come off the trail and will be heading for Caratunk to join us today after TJ has a job phone interview.  What? I was surprised…but glad too. TJ had a call from another school when we just hitting the trail, it fizzled out due to the long distance so I’m so thrilled this new call came in. We will all be in Caratunk by the close of the day.

Our climb to Roundtop Mountain begins but it wasn’t bad at all except for being crazy hot. I already need a second breakfast. Voices are heard and it’s Rooster and Old Geezer. They are perplexed at seeing us going this direction from last. We get quite the laugh.  Rooster is very happy to see we are back out here. He had come up on us the very moment I went down and offered any help he could at the time. “Glad those knees are getting you thru now”.  Trippin is about a half day ahead of you guys I say. They will rejoin soon.

We meet another two at the top, a father and daughter. She has come out for moral support and he raves on having her along to bump his spirits. She looked like she just stepped out of an REI store, clean and bright. Dad was a warn NOBO, dirty and tattered but smiling and wanting for Katahdin. Good luck to ya’ll we have a town day coming and a ride to meet.

Downhill was actually like home. Hardwoods and a dirt path trail. Nice. We come to the Long Dam Road which is really named the Long Fall Dam Road but when we were traveling with Gandalf we reinvented this for it eternal length. 2000 is spray painted in the road.  This used to be the two thousand mile mark. A hiker comes towards and lies on the number and we get a nice picture for his sharing.

One more hill and then we start off down to Flagstaff Lake. The trail is even more open now giving us view of the massive water. It’s about 9:30 and we expect we’ll make out pick up spot 30 minutes early, cool.  

Peaches, do I hear Peaches? Yep that’s him and the rest of his crew. They have slept in and just getting started. They had some off trail fun that has him moving a tad slow but hey he’s moving. Again we puzzle folks going south and makes for good conversation. 

Looking up I can see THE Bigelows…a large mountain range we were to hike but will have to wait till next year. Knowing our slack roads around this range and the Saddleback will be key next run.  The trail has thrown me some twists but I’ve made the most of it and todays hike it winding up nicely…check out these wonderful orange lilies and butterflies welcoming us to their home.  

Stepping out of the woods we end up on a dirt back road and a parking area 10:30. Thanks Bones for changing up your hike to be with me, I couldn’t have done it without you girl!!!  

Turning on my phone it blows up with messages from Anna, where are we hiking tomorrow, what time will you be back in town, is there food in Caratunk, do we have a room? No worries girl, Lead Dogs got ya’ll covered. 

Boulder comes in for shuttle right on time, 11:00. He is happy to see us waiting on him and gets a smoke while we load up. I’m sure you gals are wanting some food and drink, he has some grocery shopping to do for Paul and will stop at the first little market he come to…if he can find his way…See he isn’t too good with direction and I caught on to this right away.  He came in from the left and we are pulling out to the right. Ok maybe this thruway is quicker? BUT he said now if I can just remember the way I came in. Hummm. Chatting and driving he doesn’t seem concerned till we’ve been driving about 15 minutes and says I don’t remember this big washed out hole in the road on the way in. I speak up and say you didn’t come this way, you came from the left.   Oh boy!! 

Turning his mini cooper around we hopefully are on the way out to a paved road. Finally we spot some houses, good that’s a positive. We have several little towns to twist thru and he stops at an old corner station. Time for a smoke and us to get some refreshment. I buy extra in case this road trip turns into an all nighter. Hey let me see your map. Paul has scribbled a make shift map which I can see we are at least on the right track but I have no idea on travel time.

Soon after getting groceries we come back to familiar road..the bird houses, all along a wooden wall coming into Caratunk. The Kennebec! We are home. Lol, it’s taken us over two hours to get here and glad of it. We have our old room, shower time and a hamburger. 

Visiting with hikers on the porch a pickup rolls up and another car full of hikers…It’s Gandalf and our crew.  The party of five is back together and so are our other friends, Trippin and Highlander. Let’s celebrate…Kennebec River Pub look out.","West Carry Pond Lean-to (south)

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574525,"Today holds an easy slack day. Actually the next two days will be. We have all settled into the fact that Miss Martha is ok but not ready to tackle any big miles and we’ll take advantage of our hostel here and hike out from it each day using trusty Gandalf as our shuttle man. He has been a Godsend not charging us a dime for transport. He is a true trail angel. He’d be hiking those miles with his wife Flicker if the hips would allow and as a tradeoff is staying as close to the trail and its people as possible.  He left out early this morning to drop her off for a two day hike back to here. She normally doesn’t do more than 13 miles a day due to neuropathy in her feet. So she’s packed for an overnight stay along the way, targeting Tim’s place, Harrison’s Camp. This will put her within 4 miles of Caratunk. She’d have to really move to make the ferry ride at the Kennebec by 2:00 so she’s left out with the overnight plan.

We all had another wonderful breakfast by Paul, Cara and Boulder. They work really hard to make life easy for us. I can’t thank them enough for their hospitality and knowledge about the trail. Another hiker joined us for breakfast, Uncle. He is sectioning around in Maine and I think lives in New Hampshire area. He knew all the back rounds around here and gave us very detailed info of our next two days of hiking; a short fellow, balding with snappy fun eyes resembling Tim Conway from the Carol Burnette show.  I kept waiting for him to break out a line from the show.

Waiting for Gandalf’s return we take a walk back down to the river. Jim and kids haven’t seen it yet and maybe we’ll catch the ferry man in action. It is about starting time, 9am.  Sure enough he arrives and folks are waiting for their ride. A fellow on this side of the river said he had forded the Kennebec back in the day when no ride was provided. I think he’d like to give it a go again but age tells him different. When the canoe comes back this way with new passengers I recognize these two, its Rooster and Old Geezer. We are everywhere guys you just can’t keep up with us. 

Back at the house we gather little to nothing for our hike today. This 5.2 miles should be a true walk in the woods according to Uncle. We have no hills to climb just a slight grade back to town. Before we depart it’s another goodbye to Trippin. She’s come in for her resupply that Gandalf dropped for her and she’ll be on her way. I just love bouncing around seeing all our trail friends. 

11:00 Gandalf drops us at our starting point.  See you later you later and we’ll all head for the hot tub at the Kennebec Pub. It’s already warming to a hot day. Love it. We’ve been very fortunate to not have that Maine Rain. 

Anna don’t you pull your Jenn Pharr Davis on me now. I hear you pushed these boys over Saddleback and old Crocker Mountain. Go ahead Lead Dog you show us the way, it will be like old times. LOL  Rub it in Jim.  

It was the perfect time for me to lead, nothing hard about it. Just walking over those random rocks and then the trail turns right beside a brook for most of the hike in. A peaceful section with only Jim filling the woods with himself. Tell it man Tell it.  His only supply is his umbrella (you must have good shade protection, especially in the woods, hee hee) a power bar and bottle of water in his pocket. He is race ready at any time. 

Repassing Old Geezer he says Rooster had to remain in town till the Post Office opened. They do have very short hours. Our easy walk down is his walk up to toward Pleasant Pond Mtn. We’ll have to work over that tomorrow. 

After a slight knoll we have a snack and soon are hearing the road. We’ve just hiked better than 2 miles an hour. Damn that hasn’t happened for me in two weeks. And yes Anna wanted to finish by 1:30 and we did. Old Fox was here too, waiting on his ride by the road parking area. Good to see you dude. Take care. 
We skipped up the road looking forward to some milkshakes and canonballin that hot tub. 

The place is crawling with hikers in for refreshment as well. Even Peaches and his gang are in lounging in the yard, charging their phones and working up the motivation to move on. Then lookie who is coming now, Flicker!! Yep she has hauled arss and hiked 17.5 miles and it’s just now 2:00. That’s the cut off for the ferry. She said Harrison’s was a nice place to enjoy some quite time but after 20 minutes of listening to the birds and herself think she had to roll!  Get you a shake girl and then let’s hit the pub.

CANNON BALLL!!!!  I was this close but then thought I’d really like to eat here tonight. So I eased my happy arss down in that wonderfully hot rolling water and chugged their most robust beer. 2.0 We met at the 2000 mile mark and his buddy Butterfeet jump in. The pool filled to capacity with hikers. Come on Highland pull off that kilt and jump in. We soaked and joked. Bring on those burgers and beers. It’s been a great day, CHEERS!!","Pleasant Pond Road (South)

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574592,"Our trip is winding down. How did it happen so fast? Today is our last hiking day and it’s shaping up to be a very pretty day. Quite cool this morning the overcast is giving way to sunshine yet again. We have been so lucky. After breakfast Gandalf readies his truck for another day of shuttle service. We see Jim and Flicker off for their 12 mile hike. They will start at the river and hike to our pick up point, Moxie Pond Road.  Jim will re-hike what we did yesterday, north this time over the same 5.2 miles.  Then they will catch up with us as we hit the trail and all end meeting Gandalf.

Suzanne, a Canadian gal, came in last night and joined us for dinner. She is starting her section today. She’ll head up to Monson, get a ride back to Caratunk and then head on over the Bigelow, Saddleback and end up on Stratton. She’s packed like most of section hikers. Out for a good time and carrying just a bit more than the thru-hikers.  Having a time just getting across the border she is ready to exit civilization. Don’t forget to buy your gun at Walmart and load up on supplies it’s dangerous out there, as the border patrol instructed. LOL

Since Gandalf has some driving to do to pick us all up this afternoon (1:30 target) we take his ride back to the trail for a 9:30 start. He plans to wait here to ‘resupply’ Jim and Flicker. Jim is only carrying a bottle of water and will reload. Flicker will get her refreshment too and I’m sure they will be hot on our heels.

Starting out with flat rooted trail we pass the lean-to sign and know our one climb of the day is upon us. Everyone is checking back to make sure Big Dawg is coming along ok and I am. I feel good. Steps with some rocks and pushing up with my sticks, hey it’s hiking man, just like old times. A switch back or two. Dang are we in another state? The trail is home like and I’m loving this. We can catch views over our shoulder. Like every summit you open with rock laid trail with trees lining the way and a few rock cairns to guide the way. Pleasant Pond Mountain and its 360 degree view is wonderful. The Bigelows are way over there. Avery Peak the highest. Can’t wait to walk over you next year. We take a break and kill a little time to give our early crew time to gain ground on us. 

Middle Mountain is passed over which winds along the spin of this ridge with even more views of Pleasant Pond. Moxie Pond is to our left, we’ll be there later. Working our way down now layer by layer of ridge we stop for a snack break. Wew it’s hot on the rock. Bees buzz in our ears and then another sound rings in….I know that voice….It’s Jim. He and Flicker are close. 

Hey guys fancy meeting you here!!! Flicker’s been running me hard up over this mountain. She smiles with accomplishment. We only have 3 more miles left folks…Anna checks the time, we gotta beat 1:30!

Highlander comes in just behind them and we now have a crew storming to that road. He plans to continue on to the next lean-to after the road. Lead on Lead Dog…

And so I did. It felt good to be back in front… now not this bunch couldn’t smoke my ass, but hey I’m clicking along pretty good and feel fine. Highlander and I walk close and discuss his next miles and days until his finishes his trek. He is quick to tell me one day at a time and he’ll know when he finishes the day he walks into Katahdin Stream Campground. 
We meet many hikers heading into the woods for the weekend, it’s Friday.  Flicker’s friend she had hiked with back when her trek all started comes our way; Calamity Jane from England. She’ll see us back at Caratunk so we don’t chat long here on the trail. Besides we got a truck to catch.

Oh this trail is nice..lots of down but good down. Quick stepping to keep pressure off the knees is working. We’ve got 15 minutes Anna announces…not gonna need it girl I see the road.  

Stepping out of the woods was uplifting. This party of five has finished. And finished we did with so much more. A trail family has been formed. Tramily as they say. Gandalf, Flicker, Highlander and Trippin where ever you are. We raise our cold drinks to one and all. 

Moxie Pond Road was a delightful drive out, all along side of the pond. It was miles longs. Listing to Hank on the back roads turning up a cold one don’t get much better for this country gal. Gandalf knows how to run his trail magic. It’s a pizza run kinda day with some relaxing in the shade coming our way.","Pleasant Pond Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574607,"One last breakfast with Paul and the gang. I’ll be wanting his French toast every morning now. Paul has made extra arrangements to haul our group to Skowhegan where we’ll meet up with Caribou John for our first second leg of shuttles today. Needing 2 cars he has borrowed a friend’s car and Boulder will drive his. I made sure to jump in with Paul so not to be on some wild goose chase the wrong way…Boulder follows us. Hopefully he will not make any miss turns. Leaving here I am wanting a little more but I know on the return next year there may be a good chance I’ll be back by. Remember Jim and the kids need cross the Kennebec!!!  

Our final shuttle leg we meet up with Bonnie (Topper) in her home town, Scarborough. Thanks again John for getting us this far. We’ll be calling on you again.  Topper opens up her home for us to stay the night before taking us to our bus stop in the morning.  She has filled her frig with all sorts of goodies for us to devour in our afternoon here. Specialty brews, wine, hummus and chips, watermelon and that was just to appetize us before the main meal was served.  But first I’ll take a trip to the outdoor shower you’ve been raving about. It was heaven. Exhilarating and she didn’t have to clean up after we’d been in it. Most of our hiker grit had been left behind in Caratunk but you never know.

LOBSTA!!! He looked up at me and I hadn’t a clue how to begin. Bonnie gave us step by step instructions on how to crack this sucka. Dipped in butter, oh so good. Salad, pasta, bread, brats and chicken. And sprinkle the corn on the cob with ol’bay, it’s the Maine way.  

Stuffed, it was now time to walk it off a bit down on Bonnie’s Beach.   Ferry Beach is her stomping ground for sand, sun and surf.  Beautiful setting with the coast line of houses and boating properties. Strolling the beach, sand between our toes, we watch the sun set. Amazing!!!  Bonnie you’ve out done yourself and given us so many reasons to come back to see you. 

What a way to wrap up Maine.  This wonderfully hard hiking wilderness shows me a calming relaxing side. I’m back on the edge of Pierce Pond and then I’m here with Maine leaving me wanting more. 

 
 
PS: It was an early rising at 4am for transport to the bus. Bus to Boston. Oh we have to say good bye to Bones, she will visit with her brother before heading on home. Until next year my friend. Train Train don’t let us down. And it didn’t we traveled without incident. Good thing cause we’ll be back next year.","Caratunk

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578585,"Back to following the white blazes again. It’s been 2 months almost to the date. Time to test the knees and get that good and tired feeling again. And what better way to do this but with a newbie in tow. 

Bonnie’s grand-daughter, Rebekah, has been wanting to hike with us for some time. Heading into my July trip we were already doing double digit miles and Ninny (that’s Bonnie’s name to the grandkids) said she should wait till we started back up again and the miles would be a little less.  So the Tooth is the one today. A good 6 miles of all up and all down with plenty of rock scramble to entertain a young one and to give us old folks a run for our money.

Parking at our little spot off road 624 Bonnie gets Bekah all loaded up with a pack, snacks and water. She was told to come in comfy shoes, dress to sweat, and Ninny would take care of the rest. I should have had Ninny pack my lunch. Those clementine’s going in look mighty good and I think that was a frozen Gatorade going in too.  

Another hot day is in store and our early start will keep us in front of the heat up and hopefully too many hikers. I’m already expecting the trail will be tight at the top and those parking areas on the way back will be packed with cars. McAfee was already in overflow when we passed.  

Nothing like an up to get the heartrate up and the legs feeling sluggish. Do you like it? Don’t ask that already Bonnie….we haven’t had a chance to show her the fun stuff yet.  See those white blazes that’s what we’ll be following Bonnie says. Hiking 101 is under way and the questions and answer sessions begin. When did you start hiking Martha? You all know this story, I’ve told it a 1000 times but I do love sharing it with another. It was all your Ninny’s fault. That and her aerobics friends Renee and Janet. They invited me to this very trail. My first hike. White Blazes? From who? And where do they go? I loved it some 10+ years ago and loving it here today with Miss Rebekah.  I had to find just where all this Appalachian Trail stretched.  I got myself a map and I never looked back. 

Light smoke drifts from a leftover camp fire just as we crest our first little hill. Time for some trail duty ladies. Let’s get some dirt on this and save our playground from a chance of a forest fire. Not wanting to use up all the water we have for our hike we stomp out that sucker.  

Our first hiker comes up behind us, a flipflop hiker named Wizard on his way to Georgia. Packed light and moving fast.  Trail legs. Bonnie and both explain what that means and wishing we had some of those about now as Bekah laughs at us. 

Soon the real hiking begins as we hit the sections that back up like the Hillary step of Everest. LOL well nothing quite that technical or exciting but these ledges of toe holds and steep drop offs can be a little scary to a first timer. Not our girl. She is right on my heels and follows my every move with efficiency. Bonnie is close behind us taking care. Her reach is a tad shorter than ours so takes a few more moves to complete the same path. More and more people are on the trail now. Groups coming and going. One guy in particular stops for a chat. Well it was for a story actually. Steve from Maine, relocated to Florida, 60 year cardio nurse, peak bagger with a speech impediment due to hearing loss, trail name MugShot with a hell of a funny side. He tried to quiz me on AT facts directed around high points along the trail. Bing, bing bing…you can’t stump this monkey!!

Ok folks enough of this jeopardy let’s get to the top.  Steve blazed up the trail and we were hot on his path along 20 to 30 others. Luckily at the top we had time to eat our lunch and let the many hikers climb and adventure around. Nothing doing but for Steve to daredevil to the Tooth’s edge….arms waving high like he was ready to fly off of there I take quick photos while my heart is in my throat. Nerves of fear and I’m not even up there. Thumbs up now get down from there. No you can’t go up there young lady but I will show you how to get up on the ‘safe’ part of the tooth.

Rebekah spotted a great place for her first photo op. The towering rock tooth standing behind her while she sat looking over Catawba valley on a more secure rock outcropping.  You’ve come all this way so you have to climb up inside and see out from the safe area. Bonnie was like I don’t remember it being this hard…haha me either Bon. We were younger then and we didn’t think about falling we just did it that’s all. Clambering up and thru a tight hole, lifting ourselves up and out we find a place for that wonderful summit pic. And yes MugShot is right there, photo bomb!

What a view, what a hike, do we go back the same way Bekah asks…afraid so gal. Next time we’ll show you the other side.  Excellent!  Her friends have been to McAfee but none here. She is so excited to share her adventures of her first hike and we are so happy we could share ours with her. 


P.S. My knees are starting to talk to me now but that was to be expected. They are doing well with no giving way. I chose to use no aids to see just what my home PT training has done for me. Thanks Topper for the helpful hints I’m back at it.","Rt. 624

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579574,"Sometimes the trail less traveled is best. Not wanting to drive the interstate on the start of peak leaf season I decided to head close to home and do my old standby, the Rice Fields. What’s old for me will be new for another… Miss Nancy from Chicago joins me. She has been along on a few hikes when in town to visit her daughter and new grand babies. 

Finally a fall like day to start off with. Cool temps in the woods will make for a less heated hike up to the fields. It’s only 2.7 to the top so I’ve planned to add some miles by walking on out the ridge to a water course/camping area. Will check out the flow and report back to the folks of the local ATC so the word can pass along the trail. 

Nancy has packed her lunch, snacks and drinks in prep for a long day. I had threatened an even longer hike up to 15.4 miles but have backed that down to accommodate her rookie status. Say let me carry those for you gal that lunch tote looks better for a golf cart than on your back. Besides will be a good work out for me too. 

We hadn’t stepped even 50 yards up the trail when we are greeted by a hiker. Sobo I presume and confirm as we chat about how far he is to town and his next resupply. A rough looking fellow who has done the American Discovery Trail and jumped back on the AT to finish what he started.  

Around the next bend yet another SoBo is met and then another. The last gentleman had flip flopped from Harpers Ferry, starting there hiking north to Katahdin and is now coming from Harpers and going to Springer. Packed light and looking strong, this grey hair (LOL-no insult intended) will make it. 

I didn’t expect to see a sole today. I assure her these 3 will most likely be it all except for a huntin dog or two.  That’s what met me last trip here.  A couple of blue tick hounds running the mountain with their master. We have our blaze orange on just in case. 

Switchbacks make for an easy climb up and with our conversation we are farther along than we thought. Wow we are at the top gal. Hope we can see out. 

The AT’s course cuts a distinct path in the weathered field grass. So many have walked this trodden way make me feel nostalgic. And to share it with a newbie is always rewarding. Come on Nancy let’s go up to the crest and look out.

Heavy clouds still settle over the valley below. WV by God…she’s over there trust me. Angels Rest to our back and the shelter. Let’s have snack and enjoy the peacefulness and then we’ll walk some more.

Fog begins to slowly lift as we head on over the rest of the open fields crossing the fence stiles. A cell tower area provides a clearing for the hunters to travel up the mountain on their four wheelers. And yes we have one parked now whose rider is out scouting game. Wonder how far an arrow can fly? Bow season and all game can be had. Humm can an arrow kill a bear?

I saw a bear here in June…Nancy’s eye dart from side to side scanning the surroundings. Just us today and a few birds. 

Reaching the turnaround spot I check the water source and it is running but will require some work. If it was all I had it would do. The camping area here has grown over the years too.  Nancy has done great hiking to here and assures me she could hike on but we have some down on the return which will tax the legs so we’d better take this good feeling on back with us and about face.  Besides it’s approaching lunch time and that view off we missed before will be nice to enjoy.

Back at the tower we see the hunter returning to his charrette. Nothing in the bag. I ask if it is in fact just bow season and he confirms and yes you can hunt anything in season. He was aiming for a deer but no luck today. 

The fields do not disappoint…look at all that!!! Once above the clouds we are now looking down on all of the farm land and little houses. We have the view all to ourselves. Warm sun heats our backs while a breeze brushes our faces. Ahhhh. 

Now’s when the trail less traveled turns into an express way.  Leaving the fields we wind back into the woods and reach a train of people. 10 then 10 more. Then another 5 or 6. Where are they all coming from and where did they park I wonder. The little pull off spot might hold 4 cars. Did they bring a bus? Hurry Nancy let’s get out of here. 

Most are college kids out on adventure having no idea how far they’ve come or going but hey they are out here I give them that. Then there was the look on some of what have I gotten into. But alas two backpackers heading for that camp spot and water source I reviewed. Say are you a trail runner they ask? I had all the answers but not the title. That’s ok I like it that way. Nancy makes a good assistant too. Looks all official in her ATC blaze orange vest “Don’t Shoot, I’m a Hiker” printed on the back.  Glad we blazed this path early since my secret is out!","Pocahontas Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579892,"Excited to be heading back to where Larry and I left off last year we are interstate bound for the little town of Port Clinton, Pennsylvania.  The drive up was pretty uneventful and we called as we approached our exit to reserve our room. Ya see they don’t take booked reservation way ahead of time. It’s first come first serve. Night was falling and I really was looking forward to having a good meal in the hotel’s downstairs area which is basically street level and then going right upstairs to rest for the night before starting my hike tomorrow.

We had eaten here last trip and loved it. Reasonably prices and big portions, that can’t go wrong for anyone much less a hiker.  The ladies behind the bar gave us a key and then seated us in the dining area to get our order in as the kitchen is closing in about an hour or so.  Steak, fish, lobsta bisque, salad and sides all washed down with a few cold Yuenglings.  Their factory is just across town ya know. 

This 1800 establishment was a stagecoach stop back in the day and sets directly on the main highway along with the other houses and small businesses. We are the only patrons staying for the night but others have come to eat. 

After a great meal we go up to settle in and it doesn’t take but a few roaring sounds of the highway to get me on the notion we’d better ask for a room on the backside of this building. Truck and car traffic will not make for a good night’s rest. 

We give up the biggest bed and noise for a small bunk and lower key sounds.  Now Larry hasn’t had the privilege of staying in a hiker hotel…uh you’re lucky to get a tv and if you do get one it may or may not work. Oh and that draft you feel is all the windows open so the hiker funk can escape. Heat? Well I think that old iron thing might be heat, touch it and find out. There are 2 baths at each end of the floor, pick the one that works best for ya. Here is your towel and soap, we’ll return your $10 key deposit when you check out with the kitchen in the morning. 

I grabbed the bedspread off the room we are opting out of and take to our new place. It’s damn cold.  Larry works to get the tv working and shutting all the windows so what little heat that is coming out up here stays indoors. 

Bushed I’m ready for bed, pick your side Larry and I’ll nestle in the middle..hahaha, no middle ground here. Larry’s feet hang off the end. Turnover and we’ll spoon. It was butt to butt and cheek to cheek all night with a blow and a snore every now and again all wrapped up with the covers and of course our highway rumbles. Hiker Heaven…well… not!

We got a fairly early start so we could dine at a local favorite, 3 C’s family restaurant.  It did not disappoint.  Biscuits and gravy, hash browns, eggs, toast, bacon, pancakes and more available that tempted us. 

After a fair night’s sleep and this meal to set the stage I’m ready to knock out my miles left here in PA.","Drive from VA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579933,"Here we are again. Picking up where we left off just a week later that last year’s hike this way. The weatherman has laid out a prime week for me. Clear skies, mild temps and no rain. I hear the rocks are plentiful and I have my own vision of what might be instore but am ready for it. I’ve put in some PT time to get my legs, knees, hips back in shape for hiking since my last big stretch and sure hoping it will pay off over these next 4 days.  Days will be packed with miles and nights spent in town, aka an executive hike. No tent instead a bed and hot shower.

My crew this week is the Larry the L-Train providing shuttle to and fro. I have a few mid-day hike rendezvous spots to check-in and make sure I’m moving at a pace good to finish before night fall or if any problems might arise. And of course have refreshment at the end of the day to celebrate each sections completion. 

It is hunting season here like at home and I have bright colors on and a blaze orange vest to attach to my pack if hunters get to plentiful. Getting a tad later start than planned I’m stepping on the trail close to 9:00.  A good luck kiss and I am off.

Only one real climb today and it is ahead up to Dan’s Pulpit and then mostly ridge walking it looks like. Cobbled trail is already under foot but very manageable. Not far in I run into some fellas who are hiking the same section and me. Heavily loaded they are helping one finish his thru-hike started in 2014. Seasoned older gentlemen with quite the sense of humor get a kick out of my southern twang and try to convince me to take some of their gear on ahead for them. No chance guys I have some miles to make today and got run. 

I hadn’t left them more than a quarter mile before running into my next trail “friend”…a bear!!! I rounded a bend and then he was walking away from me. A tad close for my comfort I stopped dead in my tracks and watched….he paused and looked over this shoulder…hummmm…he then stood up on his hind legs to let me know he was bigger than I.  Click click and popped my sticks together but never said a word. He settled back down and walked off to my right into the woods. I scan both sides of the trail to make sure no little ones are with this guy or gal. Walking gingerly I peer down where he when in and see there is another bear nosing the ground.  They do not seem interested in me now and I move on along and begin my climb hoping they don’t both the fellas as they come this way. 

The rest of the day I am jumpy as a cat. Every dark tree trunk is a bear, every rustle in the leaves is a bear, ground squirrels and birds are a bear…hope this feeling lets up. I try to settle in to enjoy my hike.

The climb was short and easy and I meet a SOBO on her way to finish her thru-hike this year. Maverick, from these parts was hiking home. She had already hiked north but missed this section back to Boiling Springs after fall sick. So she bumped ahead to make sure she could beat the cold and closing of Katahdin and will be finished in a week. Watch out for those bears girl.

The ridge greets me with a rock hoping maze of trail. Step rock, rock step, sure hope this doesn’t go on for miles. My first view out and it is marvelous. Farm land, barns and houses. The pulpit has a mailbox with a hiker registry to sign in. I do so and move on. 

Rocks and rocks, I take my time and step careful. A twisted ankle or worse would be detrimental. In and out of rock overlooks I don’t run to each edge since the work back to the trail seems unnecessary. I can see from here anyways. 

7.5 miles in I come to Allentown shelter which is my lunch stop. A nice grassy area surrounds this shelter and has a picnic table. Perfect. I scan the map while eating and send out a few messages and let Larry know I am 4 miles from him and the Blue Mountain Summit B&B, our stay for the night. I will still have 5 more miles after that. If this trail lets up with rocks I could make up some time I think out loud.

And boy does it turn fine…boulevard trail we call it. Road bed, wide and free of rocks. Pushing myself to pick up the pace I walk out these 4 miles in less than an hour and a half. That’s cookin for Big Dawg!!!  

I hear the road of 309. I can see roof tops. When will the trail turn to take me across? Guard rail I am here. Larry is talking with another hiker. They are settled into conversation and he barley takes a breath to say hey honey…but he knows his girl well…he has the truck hatch up and hands me a Gatorade. Passing out his phone number he is offering assistance to “Steve” when he passes through our neck of the woods in VA. He hopes to finish by Thanksgiving. Good luck.

Eating a quick snack and leaving some of the gear out of my pack for the next 5 miles I am off and hiking again. Asking questions of other hikers who have just come over this stretch I am concerned about to more rocky sections, the Knife Edge and Bear Rocks. Both narrow passages with some tricky steps. All I can visualize is NH or Maine stuff and I am a bit scared about it. It can’t be too bad, there are no straight up lines on my map so I push those thoughts out and get to hiking. See you around 5 L-Train. 

Passing few day hikers coming back to their cars at the summit I feel even better about what is ahead. They folks are old. I got this. Step rock , step rock, I meander up to the edge. Following the blazes the trail takes me right across the rocky ledges with little room for error. I take my time and before I know it I’m to the other side and coming back under tree coverage. Another SOBO comes toward me and gives me notice Bear Rocks is next and easy. This Knife Edge coming your way is no problem dude. You’ve already done all the hard stuff in Maine I tell him. He gives a smile and disappears quickly. 

Steadily the trail turns away from these formations and eases under my feet. Quick stepping to make sure I’m out of the woods by night fall I close in on Bake Oven Road. I see the gate, I hear voices, I am here. 5:09pm. Plopping down on in the dirt parking lot I hardly care if I have a soft seat, just setting down feels good.  Shoes off,  beer back, Day 1 down. 

L-Train report: While hiking Larry settled our things in at the Blue Mountain Summit B&B. He also scoped out dinning for the evening. Leiby’s Family Restaurant. Their desert menu was 4 pages and more inclusive than their main menu. Bingo!!! 40 some flavors of Ice Cream and a pie display to die for. Larry hit his jackpot!","Hawks Mtn Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579959,"Last night’s sleep was sooo much better. Now we could still hear some of the 309 highway traffic but not like at the Port Clinton Hotel. The walls here more sound and sleeping sound helped me tune anything else out. We both had our own beds with a small working tv on the wall. Ya know the old box style and we managed to get like 7 basic channels. I wasn’t the least bit interested. After our good meal at Leiby’s I was only an hour away from going to sleep by 9pm. 

We are up early this morning to get a jump on the day. A shorter hiking day for me at just under 14 miles but I have the big arss climb out of Palmerton up Lehigh Gap. Says it’s the first time a NOBO will experience any such climb remotely close to what’s instore in the White Mountains.  Hummm, I know what that’s like and I am dreading it.  So I planned this day to get me to the climb just after lunch and 9 miles in. Larry will meet me at a parking area just before the rock mess and I can evaluate how I feel at this point before making my attempt. Knees must be in good shape is in the back of my mind.

Ken here at the Summit has our breakfast ready at 7:30, a western omelet with toast and my favorite orange marmalade. He is looking to sell his place and get out of the restraint/bar/hotel business. We wish him well and sign out and head back to the knob.

The L-Train has decided to hike in for about a mile and get his walk in today with me. The knob is a half a mile that will work. Starting by 8:45am is even better. I’ll get a jump on those rocks that await me. 

And boy did they pile up soon. A short walk in on this little fire road quickly turns up and into another rock mess. Every stared overlook or place of interest on my map so far has been a rocky area. I have come to dread them when I see the notations. “ugg that means more rocks”

A large graphically painted rock says Welcome to The Knob. The Grateful Dead band would be proud of the art work. Hawk swirl in and out from a birdwatchers decoy on the other side of us. Larry met her yesterday and she is a hawk watcher a counter. She puts in a full day of it. The morning light glow gold over us and I’m so happy Larry could share this little spot with me. Kissy Kissy good bye. I’ll see you at Lehigh Gap.

Larry will double back and drive on over to our next B&B stop at the Filbert Inn. Kathy there is already expecting him and will have a key and front door combo for access. 

My descent off the knob was tricky. My steepest down yet, rather short but very boulder like with steps farther that I want to step without setting down a few times. Anna knows my maneuver well from following me in Maine. I can see the flat ground ahead and give a sigh of relief. 

Easy footing while this morning walk in the woods winds in and out of short tree thickets. Coming into a dirt road I take a break for a snack and map read over. Three mile in and looks like gradual pull to another very rocky area of which I have noted on my map along with what I have read and or heard. It lasts for about a half mile by the looks of things. I text Larry to give him a progress report and saddle up.

Not a sole in the woods today just me and the shuffling of the leaves under my feet. Lehigh State Game Lands marks the path. Large cement pylons randomly stuck way out here in the woods.  Hunters? Where are they? I have my bright colors on again today just to be safe.

Reaching the crest I see the massive rocks jutting out of the ground ahead. Holy shit, I gotta get thru that? And I say it out loud as if something will be done about it.  Stepping now carefully from rock to rock and looking up every now and again as I get closer to this castle like maze. My frustration is answered with a double blaze and a sharp turn away from such a conundrum. The ATC heard me and apparently others and has re-routed the trail around this. For safety maybe, for lack of maintenance maybe…the map says unmaintained area…thank you thank you.

This turn takes me along a nice flat ridge with small pines and short shrubs for viewing over. A very exposed section in adverse weather but today is quite pleasant except for that highway sound starting to pierce into the woods. It’s the Pennsylvania Turnpike passing right under this very mountain. Louder and louder as I walk right over it and then drop off to the south side and begin my descent down to Palmerton. 

Hot on this side now. Full sun bakes me in the rock steps and slight twists and turns. Glad that breeze is in my face, feels good. Scanning below, that shelter should be close and I can eat lunch. Boo!! A man steps out of my left peripheral. A hunter in his blaze vest, I wave to acknowledge him and he back to me. Good day sir and where the hell did you come from I think? 

George Outerbridge Shelter comes up right on the trail. Perfect. I set down on the little bench out front with my feet almost in the trail on this downhill location eating my lunch and hearing Lehigh Gap traffic below. Another text to Larry with my eta, say about 1:15.

Closer to the road than I realized the trail pops me right out with a full view of the big climb that awaits. Doesn’t look that bad up close. I got that. 

Construction workers have the Gap bridge down to one lane of passage. Hummm wonder if my pathway is clear to walk over? I follow my blazes right up to the first hard hat. Howdy? Can I pass? He points to his foreman for approval and give me escort out and past where an inspection is going on for the bridge. You have a good hike ma’am and be safe he says tipping his hat and mine to him. 

Passing off the bridge the trail takes me up another highway road which I must cross. Four lanes of traffic and no light…I see the blazes on the other side as I step over the guardrail. Ready set go, all clear for a split second and I’m safe on the other side. Now to find Larry’s parking lot. 

Waiting with the few cars parked here I cool my feet a bit and talk to a few day hikers coming a going. Larry arrives after some traffic delays. Glad to see him I get a cold Gatorade and eat some of my grapes left in the cooler. Nice to have this traveling Sherpa with me. Since I have waited almost 45 minutes and have almost 5 more miles left in my day I don’t hang out to much longer. He makes sure I’m ready for my climb and gives me an at a girl and go. 
Our next meeting will be at Little Gap road not far from the B&B.  

Seeing the day hiker coming and going I feel even better about going up this. If they can I know I can. Open rock with continuous views with extreme exposure in adverse weather the map states. No worries on all the above. 

Steps and switchbacks make this very manageable. Hardly breathing heavy my stamina is in good check and so are the knees. Careful watch the blazes for the tactical way. Steps lay out the best path in this all rock climb. A few places required a hand hold and a toe in a slot to step up and over. Two fellas have stopped in the “trail” for a view and provide me a good place to take a picture back over my shoulder. Wow it’s a long way down to that bridge I just crossed. As I pass up and around them I am now on the back side of the climb and can see to top. Careful still to watch my way and footing I am out of what was my dreaded part of this whole trip and am overcome with relief. 

Now for some history on this area and what happened to make this area into a “dead zone”.  From 1898 to 1980, the New Jersey Zinc Company emitted sulfur dioxide at rates of up to 3,600 pounds per hour, killing plant life and animal habitats. Twenty years later, a noticeable lack of tree density remains on the Palmerton side of the gap. 

As I hit the ridge the plant life was desert like. No trees only weathered shrubs and dead wood on the ground. The trail cut thru like a back dirt road for over a mile and then grass and life came back into play.  

Two awesome miles of ridge walking. Thick green grass laid over with the weight of dampness still from this morning I guess.  I couldn’t figure it out. How can this be wet? It’s been almost 70 today. But the shade from the slight side hill and the north side of the ridge must do it. 
Walking with ease I follow the factory work below. Building after building of what looks like stone mining, industry and such. Bet they have no idea I’m up here. 

Once I see the powerline I know my walk in the park is over time for some end of the day rocks and my quest for Little Gap.  My feet pick their way as if they are beginning to know the routine. 
Evening sun cast shadows as my day is coming to an end and none too soon. I’m ready for a set down, been going strong since I left Lehigh Gap.  This dreaded day has turned out to be a wonderful delight. 

L-Train Report: After leaving me at the gap Larry visited a local golf course called Woodstone, a recommendation from Kathy at Filbert B&B.  Turning down a barstool with a member to come back and pick up his wife he has us lined up for dinner and drinks after a hot shower. 
Dinner with a view, it was fabulous. The sun set as we filled ourselves with their finest food, drink, and great service.","Bake Oven Knob Road
",Little Gap,"Oct 19, Thu",13.70
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579983,"Did you hear that train last night? It ran every hour on the hour.  Filbert’s Rose Room rattled with the sounds of nothing that could possibly human or could it. Did you put that mouth piece in Larry?  I tossed and turned all night while the train tuned up. I have almost 16 miles to walk tomorrow and I’m gonna be dog tired. But my driver will be fresh as a morning daisy. 

The alarm was to go off at 6:45am, breakfast at 7:00. Getting up before the alarm sounds I get myself ready for the day. My clothes have been washed by Miss Kathy so I’ll smell nicer than before for the next two days. I flick the light on as a measure of frustration to wake Larry. Breakfast time big boy, rise and shine.

Scrambled eggs with cheese, seasoned potatoes, fresh fruit cup, Texas toast and bacon. Our best breakfast thus far and the best accommodations too. Every night has been a step up I tell her with her being way on the top. Antiques fill every space. This 1800s built farm house and farm is a real step back in time. 

With more than I could eat I asked for a to go baggy and fix myself a Texas toast samich for later, first lunch.  Thank you so much for your hospitality and I’ll be sure to share your place with others along the trail.  Larry will return here after dropping me off from just up the way a short 5-10 minute drive.  Check out isn’t till 11:00 and he plans to get some more shut eye.  I’m betting he will not make a sound since I’m not there to very it. 

Another blue bird day with a little more nip of fall in the air. The target time to meet today is the end of the hike, Wind Gap say 3:00/4:00. I’ll text my progress, no half way meeting place this time, it’s all or none. 

Flat flat flat the map profile goes and so does the trail. With only a slight up from the gap and of course my good morning rocks I am on the ridge in no time. Smaller trees and hardwoods this reminds me of home. Boulevard trail for miles. Before I know it I’m 5 miles in and approaching Smith Gap, a dirt road, I can take a break here. 

A cool breeze keeps me in long sleeves for most of the morning. Basically speed walking I’m not working up much of a sweat. Spots of cobble rock come and go but not so it’s much of a hindrance. 

Coming across the road I notice two bench-like areas built. Probably to keep four wheelers from passing but they did make a good place to set down. Two canned items are left for a thru-hiker named Mark. Beef Stew and Chunky Chicken Noodle. They both sound wonderfully good right now but I’ll dig into my leftovers from the Filbert. Steamed from the remaining heat trapped in the ziplock bag it was still warm after 7 miles of hiking. No cell signal here, I’ll try to text and see if it goes as I walk. About half way done and it’s not even noon yet. 

Finally I run into my first hiker of the day. A gal heading south loaded for colder weather. She looks young and stout. Stay at the Filbert, great place and food I tell her. Then just past another mile or so I run into an older fella out for a training hike. He lives just down Smith Gap road and is making a 10 mile loop. He has lost 100 pounds in the last year and looking to keep himself healthier by hiking like he used to do as a young boy. He was very inquisitive about my journey and why I was out by myself. You aren’t from around here are you? No sir from Virginia doing sections with my husband picking me up at the end of each day. He says you hope so right? If you’ve been a good girl he’ll be there hahaha.  He tells me Leroy Smith Shelter is close and a lady from VA is staying there for the night. I doubt I will go down to this shelter it’s 0.4 off the trail and I have plenty of water for the trip I say. 

He was right it wasn’t but an hour and I was at the shelter junction, once I saw the powerline I knew I was close and of course some rocks to greet me. 1:00 I’m ahead of scheduled 1:30 target arrival. Very happy I am and that goes right in line with the signage placed. Happiness Starts Here. 

Warm sun, falling leaves, peaceful spot I find on this log for a set down and lunch. Two more hikers come south. Guy and gal looking for a place to rest too. Water needed so they head on to the shelter. I could tell they had just resupplied in town, packs looked very full. As dry as it is up here you’d have to carry almost 2 liters of water. I’d only want to reload once to keep from going so far off the trail each time. 

LT I’m coming your way. He’s already a the trailhead since checkin at our next place, The Red Carpet Inn, isn’t till 2:30. Wind Gap had a few other hotels but all were just plan dumps with vagrant residence. If you refer to Awol’s guide and see the Travel Inn or Gatewood, disregard and go elsewhere. Even Kathy gave us warning. 

Fortified and feeling fine I’m ready for the next 4 miles to town. The trail turns to the north side of the mountain and more shade hits, much cooler. Then it turns me south and wow warmth again. I took note of the pipeline area and how this look could possibly be coming to our part of the trail in Pearisburg and Newport VA. I don’t like it. An extremely large swath of trees cut to clear for the line. Tall tall dead grass I walk thru, taller than I stand. I hope a lion doesn’t come out and eat me.

Coming up to 2 overlooks prior to coming off the ridge I’m hoping for a clear view out over some town or valley. Hahn and Lookout Rock are not all that but they do give me some openness to see Wind Gap. Rock steps and steeper trail brings me in ear shot of Rt. 33. More trucks and traffic. Thinking I’ll have more of a road walk than there really is I’m spit out almost right at the trail head. Welcome to Wind Gap, Appalachian Trail N< > S. 

L-Train Report: As I said the hotel situation in Wind Gap was sketchy. I had first noted Travel Inn as our stop but last minute reserved our room at the Red Carpet Inn. My instructions however were not updated the best and Larry went to Travel’s desk. Not impressed he moved on to find the Carpet Inn a much better option. Very new and clean we have a nice place to stay and all the channels a sports fan could want. The survey of town brought us to the local Sal’s Italian. Super sized pizza and Magic Hat #9.  Watching football as the nighttime grows later Larry is in his element and I’m with my dreams.","Little Gap
",Wind Gap,"Oct 20, Fri",15.40
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579990,"After a wonderful night’s sleep I am up and raring to wind down my last day’s miles in Pennsylvania.  The great part about today is I get to share it with a hiking friend whom I’ve never met but feel like I have.  Facebook is a wonder thing, bringing folks together and that’s how we randomly connected.  He is from the area and has hiked all these PA miles may times over. Asking for his trail knowledge and area details the last few years as I’ve been hiking this state, he has provided a wealth of knowledge to help me. Grabbing a quick bite at Burger King we head for the trailhead 7:45am

Mr. Joseph Beck is waiting for us having already drove an hour plus.  He plans to meet up with his son and daughter in-law for dinner later so this early start works for him too. Larry and I plan to head on back home after the hike and get ahead of the Sunday trucker jam. Also my mom hasn’t been well and has had a visit to the hospital. Long story short on this, she is doing much better with new meds and some minor surgery.  I am anxious to see her just the same.

After our introductions and game plan discussion of how far Joe will walk with me and estimated time to hit DWG, we wave back to Larry and head off to it. Having the fresher legs I ask Joe to lead our way. We have an abrupt up with more rocks steps and turns and hit the ridge in about a mile. This time the ridge is riddled with rock. The worst I’ve had thus far. Pointy little suckers that you can’t possibly get a foot between. Shoe Chewers. “Have you had enough rock yet? Joe asks. Hell yeah man. I’m over this and I mean almost literally. 

The ridge goes by so fast hiking with a buddy. Stories of hiking, our families, and more stories of hiking carry on nonstop. We gotta go Live Joe…. He was like ok…I begin videoing and talking about the walk and what a treat it has been to have him along.  He’s not a ya’ll guy but you’ze guys would love to meet him. 

Giving me detailed trail descriptions for what’s ahead while we hike our last mile together he’s set me up for easier day.  His mileage counter sounds off we’ve come 6 miles. He was only gonna hike 5 and then double back but decided to carry on a little while longer. 2ish miles an hour has gone by fast. First lunch. 

You’ll have Wolfe Rocks and then hit Fox Gap. You’ll start seeing folks about there he predicts. No hard areas to worry about. Those starred places on your map are just dots of rocks and you’ll pass them quickly. Yeahhh and woods road will take you on to easy walking. More yeah from me. He also advises I hit Kirkridge Shelter for my second lunch. A nice view out and parallels the AT so no time lost.   Departing we give a hung and happy trails. We’ll text each other at our finish lines. 

I reached Wolfe Rocks in no time. It was just as described, large slabs of rock to pass over with views out over the adjacent ridges. Fall color is full on bright in this section. A tedious descent back to normal good trail was appreciated. Several hikers come and go from side trails as I close in on Fox Gap and its mountain pass road PA 191. A very busy area with cars parked on all sides of the road. A couple hiking in stop to talk with me curious about my pack and patches and of course my southern drawl.  You’ze all the way from Viginia? Yes Ma’am Heading for DWG, What? That’s over 7 miles away, you’ze crazy. Yes Ma’am. Proudly I tell her what all I have hiked this day and what’s next…oh and I’m headed for Maine next. Big smiles all around and good luck.  Walking away I hear her tell her husband they must get some of those hiking sticks for next time. 

Kirkridge shelter did not disappoint. A fine few out between a select group of trees while I have my lunch. Two day hikers are here. One who has done more hiking than the other but both very knowledge of the AT.  They are headed for DWG too. 

Just out from the shelter I come to a nice meadow, with some tenting going on. The weekend is here and it’s prime time to get it all in while you can. Thru-hikers relax in the sun and I have one take my photo overlooking the valley. 

More and more people are past coming my way. They have come from Totts Gap and Mount Minsi. Hiking to and fro from Fox Gap too. Interstate like trail with moments of open edges and then turns full on road bed. This must be Woods Road Joe mentioned. This will be my mile and a half cruise to Minsi.  

The length of the day begins to ware on me a bit here. The long road seems to go on forever. I keep looking off to my right for glimpses of the water way…is that the Delaware River? It has to be I’m closing in.

A busy spot with many people to my right comes in sight. No sign, is this Mount Minsi I ask?  Yes they say. Woop Woop. Step aside young man it’s time to tell it Live. You see folks that  Delaware Water Gap is my destination. I’ve been walking since before 8am from Wind Gap. This ol gal is ready call PA done.  Some cheers from those that can make sense of me are excited for me and give me a pat on the back.  Yo Larry look for me at the Deer Head Inn about 3:30.

The down from Minsi was the steepest down I’ve had the whole trip. It wasn’t technical just over a mile or so of it. Thickets of rhododendron and rock outcropping jags to look over the Gap. If I’d had all day this would have been nice to explore all the little stops along the way down. Lookout Rock provided my best view of the water gap, a deep cut in the mountains which I’ve already climbed on the NY side. 

More and more folks, I have to be close to the road. Then a sight for sore eye approaches. I don’t dare yell out as that might embarrass him and I’d be doing so over this family right in front of me.  L-Train!!!! He’s come in to walk the last blazes with me. Very surprised to see me already he is laughing with relief that he didn’t have to walk to far up this grade which is all road now. Don’t hurt yourself Larry. 

I see the Deer Head Inn. The place where we started checking off all of our northern states. NJ/NY, CT, MA, VT, NH, some of ME and now I step across this Rte 611 and see my last blaze of PA. It’s taken 4 years of sections to complete you old rocky state. Ol Lead Dog is happy as happy can be. Thank you thank you Larry for all our support. Now let’s grab that celebratory beer and look ahead to Maine. 

L-Train report:  Drive baby drive. After our cold brew from the porch of the Deer Head Inn we cleaned off by the car and jumped in for our long drive home. With only a quick stop at the Apple Pie Market, akaVillage Farms here in town, and a refuel stop and some post trail Taco Bell (a staple on these long hauls) he got us home with little traffic 7 hours later. Told ya I’d get you home by midnight!","Wind Gap
",Delaware Water Gap,"Oct 21, Sat",15.50
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580683,"Larry called our meeting today. Let’s go to the Cascades. It’s short. So I sent the message and lookie who all came?  Now I’d loved to have had some more but there will be plenty of time to get your chance. 

Signing in at the kiosk I see Anna and TJ are waiting on us. We have picked up a buddy of theirs, Jared, who has hiked with use once before. Now where is Denny and Noni? I had over looked them scanning the parking lot. Good to have you two back. It’s been too long. 

Everyone is bundled for the cold day and WIND…No problem, we’ll be tucked in the holler for most of the day. Might get a taste of it on the return walk down the fire road, it’s more open there. The rain showers on the drive over have now turned to wind snow. Perfect. I’d rather be fighting this than a cold rain and really slicks rocks. 

Excited to be hiking local again and with so many friends I’m walking as fast as I’m talking. Wait? Where’s our other girl? Noni selected her spot to the rear letting the boys catch up on their conversations. I drop back so we can visit and hike too. This could turn into a long day with some tall tales. 

Anna and Jared lead our little pack along and select stops for everyone to regroup and take photos. No one out much so we take our time and ping pong around so everyone has some visiting time. 

The creek is flowing normal, not to full or low. Raging waters have pushed debris in piles at some time and closer to the falls the trail is washed out. Hikers have had to climb the bank of tree roots to make passage. Forest Service is gonna have some work here to fix and it not wash again. 

Gathering up on the viewing deck we have the place to ourselves. More stories from all our times here are told. Remember when it was iced over solid or when the falls was just a trickle. We’ve seen it all. Never experienced a tragic moment though but there have been some recorded deaths from careless hikers getting to close for comfort. 

Denny leads Noni back the way we came to get a jump on the rest of us going up to the fire road walk. They will connect back to the road too and we’ll catch’em.   

Maine talk creeps into the walk out with Anna and me making long term plans for a successful trip back up north. We soon do pass these front two. 
Larry runs sweeper and preacher making it known that he sure can plan a good hike. Just keep note when he is the expedition leader and you’ll sure to be satisfied and not petrified. And there is most likely a food stop involved afterwards. Gotta keep our strength up he professes. ”That’s how I get this svelte figure!” he grins. Come on hikers it’s time for Mexican, the L-Train is moving out.","The Cascades

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580835,"Two weeks in a row with the L-Train picking out the course. Hummm I can’t get totally ready for Maine like this but I sure can enjoy some easy like Sunday morning kinda hikin. 

Another perfect day for hiking with the sun a shinin. We are the only ones in the little parking spot off 606 at Kimberling Creek. Not a surprise this time of year. 

Crossing the road we hike north toward the side trail of Dismal Falls. I bet I’ve hiked here more than a dozen times. Snow, Ice, Sun, Fog, Rain. It’s the perfect trail for when you have to get your trail fix in any kind of weather. Not sure if Larry’s getting a fix today or just pacifying his wife. 

Winding trail switchbacks up into the woods and around the side of the hills above the road. Trent’s store, a local convenience store and hiker stop, can be seen down below us. Once we leave it’s sight we are disconnected from the sounds of community and have the forest to ourselves. 

This graded up slope has Larry taking his sweet time. I’m almost half striding not to get so far in front of him.  Guess I’d better just loaf along with the master or I’ll turn this short hike into even a shorter one. Actual mileage to the side trail is 1.9. Side trail to the falls is .3.  So round trip we’ll have walked 4.2. Hey don’t knock it or Larry might hear us and buck on the next adventure. 

Catching back up to me he is wondering just when we’ll be reaching this side trail. Shouldn’t we hear the water by now? I point down to the greenery, rhododendrons, that’s when you’ll hear the falls. Come on ol’ man let’s get to it. 

Heading now on the slight down I decide to stretch the legs a bit and wait for him at the sign. Let’s see if he’ll follow suit if I am out of sight….

Rushing water is heard. If we were to walk straight for the sound we come right to it but the trail turns away for piece and then we’ll have the .3 to walk thru the corridor of rhodos to reach the water’s edge. 

Waiting at the sign for only a few minutes Larry is right behind me a tad out of breath.  You out of shape dude? No more than these other’s behind me he says with a smile and a laugh. Haha good one. Come on let’s see them Falls.

Closing in like clockwork a truck drives by on the forest road which runs parallel to the stream. The even easier way in so don’t remind Larry of that!  The driver’s huntin dog must be in the back and is shouting to us he is coming thru.

Rays of sun shimmer, dancing with the water. The falls aren’t full but cascading nicely from rock to rock over its layered ledges. A perfect summer swimming hole and is noted on the trail sign earlier. I’ve seen this area littered with hikers bathing and sunning on the sheets of rock. Today we walk all along area free of disturbance…only the babbling of the brook …..and…well… of Larry. Ha I couldn’t help myself. 
Come on honey let’s get ourselves a pretty picture and head on back so you can watch some football.","Rt. 606

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581995,"Nothing to do but get out. One by one the message board confirms too cold to hike. Either by phone or via the weather man. But how can that be? The place is crawling like ants. Did another memo get posted? Come, come to the Cascades. 

I fully expected a hand full of cars in the lot when arrived around 10am. Ok there were two handfuls maybe more. Shoot under warmer temps I’ve been here by 9am and seen less cars. Guess the news of the frozen falls has folks wondering…I am one of them. Seen it before but it draws me back.

Dressed in my warmest and am fully prepared to not freeze I do expect I’ll be out of the down jacket by the first bridge. Expecting some ice on the rocks on the lower trail I decide I’ve done that enough and haven’t walked up the fire road in some time. Always returned by this route it will be a good leg/lung workout if I keep a good pace. 

Just me today, Lone Lead Dog. What was looking like a pack of gals to come with and maybe a Larry and a TJ has turned to not. That’s ok I like these days sometimes. Me and the trail …uh not for long…..

I do have the side of the trail to my lonesome for most of the hike up. Seeing others taking the lower falls trail I recall saying when over there, why would anyone wanna walk just up the fire road? Well here I am. 

Coming out of the jacket and extra layered gloves at the first bench, which was past the bridge, the sun has this side warming nicely to a sweet 8 degrees.   No wind, thank goodness. I do have my yak traks for in case of ice but only the dusty trail under foot so far. 

Reaching the junction of .3 to the falls I can hear the sound of people. No roar of the falls as usual from this point. The rocks along the creek are dry too. Surprising! 

The creek is almost frozen from side to side, only a quick run flows down the middle. The small tributaries below looked frozen solid. I can see where some have ventured down the sides of the ice to test its strength. I’ll stick to my rocks I know they are safe.

Voices, I shall take my first 2018 live video from this spot. My favorite view of the falls anyways. A small distance from the actual viewing platform, this location captures depth and serenity.  Take it in now cause this shall be lost in about 5 minutes.

People…glad only about 10 of us here at this moment each taking turns going out to get their time with the massive ice structure. I have never had the need to walk out over what looks totally frozen and touch the piled ice at the base but many are doing so now,  and oh will there be more to come. I shall leave them to it and hike up above on the conservancy trail for a bit.

Snow snow, I knew if I went high enough it would be on the ground. Barney’s Wall is on above but it can wait for another day. Ice is starting to come into play across the trail. Not wanting to test my skating skills, without others to capture on film or administer aid when I fall, I about face.  

The return hike has me saying hello, good day, happy trails, how are you this morning, every other breath. Never seen so many folks on this trail maybe because I am usually long gone by now or just plan around such. Groups of 10-12, old and young, hikers and not so much are coming in. 

Reaching the parking lot it was like a warm summer’s day. Cars double parked and having to hit the road sides to find a space. Enjoy the view I say it’s a good day for a hike. Come one, Come all…the Cascades.","The Cascades

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582151,"Come on ladies there’s a mountain to climb.  Cold? What cold? You should be used to this by now, been cold for weeks. 

I pick up Rebekah, Bonnie’s grand-daughter, you remember her.  She loved her last hike and is very excited to be coming to another new place along the trail and best of all she has new boots. Ninny has her sporting some quality trail shoes and has her layered up in some hand-me-downs to keep warm. Also on the pick up this morning is the City Slicka, Carolann. All color coordinated in her finest pinks and several layers of tights, she to is layered for the day. 

Bonnie sets waiting on us at the Narrows Road parking lot. Her first time at this location. So how far up to the road, our original parking spot she asks? This is gonna add to our up, Martha! Yeah but not much…only a mile at the most. 

Hats and gloves, check. Scarves and mittens, check. I have hand warmer in case. I’m already cold, Slicka, cackles out. Here have my down vest. You were just sweating in the car on the ride over. Good lord!

Rebekah comes on to the front with me as our senior ladies gather to the rear discussing how they will be on along for us to not worry about them. Crossing into the field and into the woods our hike up begins.

Switchbacks and graded new trail have this part a rather nice intro to what is above. Bonnie knows but our others are new to this section. Bekah is all smiles and chats along with me about her love for the outdoors and her new boots are so comfy. 

In no time I have warmed to the need of coming out of this down jacket. It is the best but sure can’t hike in it for long. Bonnie comes out of her’s too. I stress to my others to not sweat or you will get wet and cold when stopping. They assure me they are just fine. 

Clear skies now as the morning cloud cover has lifted. Hardly a breeze either. The ground under foot crunches as we step and any water remaining in the small seeping streams are frozen.  Today’s high not to get out of the 30s. Guessing teens now. 

Reaching the paved road, Cross Road, Rebekah and I wait for our Chatty Cathy’s to come on along. We can’t see them but we can always hear them. Huffing that they have been couch potatoes I confer, me too.  Damn that was all up! Yep and there’s more to come I smile. Bekah is our InstaSnapper taking pictures and keeping her peeps informed of her progress.

We have the trail to ourselves. Only a couple and a dog seen just as we left the parking. They are out in front of us. Maybe we’ll see them at the overlook. 

Twists and turns of the trail put us always looking down at our other two. Periodic stops we take to regroup and get a drink of water. And always a story or lie told. Girl talk! 

Snow is now surrounding us as we gain elevation. Cold air wraps around my shoulders and I have put my gloves back on. Steeper trail, the cold feels good, I am sweating but can’t stop gotta get to those rocks. Rhododendrons pencil tight with cold line the trail, more snow. We are almost there Bekah. Wow this part just keeps going she says. 

See there they are, big rocks the sign will be right here. Before setting down we get our jackets back on and something to set on. The rocks are like blocks of ice and will suck the heat right out of ya. Shaded this is a refrigerator and we’ll not eat lunch here but on up at the next overlook.

In a short 15 minutes Bonnie and Carolann are heard coming up. See there’s the rocks, we are here Bonnie says. Deja-vu. Red faced and bright-eyed Slicka has made it. Come on ladies let’s check out the rest.

Scamper up on top of the Angel’s Rest rock we get our own view. Pearisburg, The New River and all else we are above. It was a photo shoot for some minutes before the chill set in and told us time to get moving. 

Heading up to the next overlook the sun is now over us and will provide a more comfortable stop for lunch. We run into a section hiker who’s been our for a week already and heading to Pearisburg for resupply.  She has hit her 1000 mile mark on the AT. Her name was Quiet Storm, from Baltimore. She was packed light for a winter hiker but looked well geared out and experienced.

Wilburn Valley Overlook wowed our newcomers. They liked it better than Angels Rest. I sorta do too.  Wide open space and sun in my face. 

Say what’s for lunch Ninny? Bonnie has packed a well-rounded meal for her grand-daughter. Watch out CA don’t fall off that rock girl, it a long ways down. Youth takes Bekah close to the edge for her photo op with instruction to slide back and not stand up. Lunch and laughs. It don’t get much better than this.

Still a chill in the air has us closing out our time here sooner than later. Come on ladies let’s get that leg burn going again. 
Inquiries of how long will it take us to get back down having me guessing 2:00 or so. Took us an hour to get here from the last road. Oh we can do better than that on the way down, confidence spouts.  

Dang this is steep, ouch, shit, I’m slipping….Knees pop and crack in the back while I try to keep up with our young one. She’s pushing me ya know. Making tracks off I’m feeling pretty good and the legs are holding up well after few workouts. Bekah has no problems and is only following to be nice :o)  

Reaching the cross road again has some wishing a car was here but up for the challenge to finish strong. Shit how much farther down?, my knees are killing me CA says. Not far now, Bonnie’s been a good coach from the back and has her pointed in the right direction. 

The last stretch flew by for us front runners as we talked our way right out of the woods. What a great hike. Where is the next one? Oh be careful what you ask for, I’ll plan them up so you’ll have no time for your dancing…Wonder how far back Ninny is?

Wait, look who’s waiting on us, The Captain. He’s been waiting for 2 hours he says, where the hell ya’ll been? Oh you know how a bunch of women can get when out on their own. Wild and Loud.   And speaking of loud here they come…Woop Woop, cheering coming thru the field the last of the ladies are happy to be finished.","Pearisburg

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582310,"Old standbys are the best. You know what’s ahead, what to expect. They full-fill your expectation and give relief of no surprises, usually. That’s why I picked Newport VA’s Kelly’s Knob for our hike today. And of course it was approved by another good standby, Miss Bonnie, Steadfast. 

We met at the little market off Rt 460/42 so we could carpool in. The parking at the trail crossing of 42 is a little tight. Roadside parking can have you losing a mirror due to fast truck traffic and we all know not to park at the donkey barn area. Nascar lady’s property and she does petrol leaving her own sort of tickets. So we now park at a stop sign area just down from the Level Green church. It’s a good gathering place with a car already here this morning.

A sunny warm day is forecasted but where has this wind come from? It has us grabbing for a wool hat verse a baseball cap. I have my gloves for in case too. We’ll warm quickly so let’s get to moving Bonnie. 

No donkey’s in the field right now and the footbridge is holding. Guess the beaver have gone to a warmer place, the water flows easy. Cresting over the first little hill the wind throws us side to side with its gusts. An ominous cloud stretches dark above dividing the grass lands the trail runs through and some kind of wondrous blue skies.  Hurry Bonnie let’s get to the woods for protection. 

Expecting snow on the north slope, only a dusting remains. The trail takes us in and around the mountain directing us to our climb after the old house spot and the shelter. We can hear the water of Laurel Creek, wonder if it will be frozen and slick to cross? Bonnie is already talking about how we might get across the two spots in case of bad footing. 

Large ice clumps hang from the draped branch down in the water. Slick slick on all these rocks Bonnie, lets cross right here where some branches have formed a water bar. Easy does it, take your time and keep your balance on each spot it will hold. One crossing down, one to go.

This one has more area for stepping but it’s all under water so we must improvise. Rock, branch, rock, log, rock and we are over. No wet feet, at least on the out now let’s hope we can do the same on the return.

Remember our first time here? Bonnie says how can I forget. Snow was deep and every step up we slide back two. We climbed and climbed and once at the crest we declared this to be Kelly’s Knob not realizing the actual overlook and sign noting such was just down the way along the ridge.  

The wind is really gusting now in the tree tops. I’m shedding a layer now so I don’t get so hot on the hike up and can put it back on at the ridge. Bonnie fades out of sight. We know how this goes. Hike your own pace and we will regroup at the crest. I know the very rock I’ll be setting on when she’ll reach me. 

More training comes to mind as my legs pump with my heart.  It’s early in the hiking season for 2018 and this will be one of many to prepare for Maine and whatever else I can get into between now and then. Say Bonnie when do you wanna hike Rock Castle Gorge? Uh like never? Ah you can shorten it if you’d like, you can come and go at all sorts of spots on this 11 mile loop. I’ll see if Harry wants to come too. LOL…You’ll have to ask them about his folks or review back in my journal..this has a story all on its own. 

More leg burn while the winds whip. I see my rock time to bundle back up. About 10 minutes and Bonnie pops around the corner huffing that these back to back climbing hikes are getting the best of her. Me too girl but we’re on the top now and know where that overlook is so let’s get to it. 

Still a little snow remains in the coldest north spots. The rocks of the knob are too much in the brunt of the wind gust so decide not to have lunch here. Instead we’ll take in the view and tuck back into some cover and set direct in the sun to chow. Heavy coats on and gloves close by for in case. PBJ, fruit, snacks and some Gatorade have us feeling fine. 

We have the place to ourselves, early hikers get this privilege. I saw footsteps in the snow earlier hiking this way but we have yet to run into them.  Heading off we do run into a gal with her 3 dogs going to the knob. She seems to be familiar with the hike and asked how windy it was. Hang on to your hat kind of wind I say. Happy trails.

Our knees are hurting a bit from the down but not so to dampen our spirits or fun. Let’s get across these creeks without an arsss busting fall or wet backside. Woo Bonnie Woo, don’t go that way there’s no way out. She’s got her head down tippy toeing across the rocks and run right up into a road block. Getting a better look at where I crossed she is back on track and safe to the other side. 

Hikers, four guys in big packs. Where’s the overnight fellas? Kelly’s knob! Say you didn’t see a load of boy scouts did you? No we answer. They are relieved as I would be too. Nothing says no sleep like camping with scouts. They must have gone Sarver direction. Hey Martha, is that you? John is that you? I know this guy. He is a friend of a friend and has wanted to hike with me and my bunch but just never has panned out. Enjoy man you’ll have the knob to yourselves.

Two more hikers come our way as we are almost back out.  A section hiker headed for Pearisburg and a local carrying absolutely nothing but a jacket on his back. Hike your own hike!

The winds have calmed just a bit and sun is still shining on our backs. Our field walk has us reminiscing of remember this time and that time. Exactly why we old standbys keep coming back to this good old standby.","Rt. 42, Newport Va

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588501,"My first steps back in the woods since January 20th.  These past 3 months have been full of physical therapy after a meniscus repaired and arthritis scrapped out to anxious thoughts of when will my knee be ready to go. Well today is when the shoe met the trail and it was just what the doctor ordered.  

Now many of you know the knee hasn’t been the only think flaring up in my old body. Dang left foot had a nagging nerve that I finally gave in a got a cortisone shot in so I could play golf at the beach week before last. Good as gold now. Then while at the beach I pulled a dresser drawer out too fast and wham! Smack down on my right foot’s big toe. Yep black and blue, gonna lose that toenail. So all these little things have kept me hobbling along all the while nursing the knee back to trail ready.

Passing Woods Hole Hostel on our drive in we see several hikers on their porch relaxing. There are a couple of cars here at the three-way. A cold wind blows as we get our packs on and that extra shirt. The L-Train falls in behind me as Lead Dog sets her eyes on those white blazes. 

It never felt so good to be back out on the Appalachian Trail. Every step was like eating that favorite spoonful of ice cream and letting it melt in your mouth. Scanning my surroundings I felt as if I was within its arms. Protected and loved as I love it. I wanted to jump for joy but hey I ain’t quite there yet. LOL

Gradually the trail climbed to the crest of Sugar Run and we kept looking for the spur trail to Doc’s Knob overlook. Not being here for a couple of years I’m not sure it’s exact location and recall no sign was up at the time. Rocky trail has my eyes glued to it more than usual to assure my steps are good and true. Don’t want to twist a knee….Glancing up now and again I feel sure we haven’t passed it but can tell Larry is wondering if we have. 

There, that little patch of rhododendrons,  that’s it. A worn path shows the way to the overlook of the gap in the mountain. Angels Rest is way over there. We don’t venture up on the rock slab. Step ups a little too high for me and I don’t do knee on rocks just yet.  So we head on to the shelter, our destination 2.2 miles in. I’ve heard it has been modified with a deck added. Can’t wait to see the work. 

Down we go, another gradual grade. I feel the calf and hamstring working to keep my knee safe and of course that black toes betting the front of my shoe. Glad we aren’t really tackling a “true” hard down or I’d be paying for that about now. Larry clicks along behind me asking where this shelter is and the fire road. He suggests we walk it back and then the road to the car. Uhhh I think that will add a mile to our trip, maybe more, I don’t wanna I whine.  Yes you heard it here, Lead Dog, doesn’t want to hike more miles today. WHAT? Who is this person? Wink wink.  

Smoke is coming from the shelter area. Sharpie is here with his dog Toby. Hey I know you we both say. He section hiked the AT some few years ago, wrote an article in the AT Magazine and is a writer in our local paper. He helps maintain this section and said a donation to the RATC helped pay for this wonder new addition. Homer and Theresa Witcher were paramount in the project. New privy, new deck, a bench and water source repair. Great job folks. 

After some light stretching I encourage Larry along and that no naps are allowed like Toby. Returning back from which the way we came was not to Larry liking but he trudged along to pacify his wife, not knowing Sharpie would be leaving out soon after and we could have caught a ride in the back of his pickup truck. Well Damn.

Legs felt good going up just need to get the cardio back up to par too. We met a few hikers going and coming. All of which had smiles on and in great spirits. That’s what this trail will do to ya. This is Lead Dog Live..happy as happy can be to just be here.","Sugar Run Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588640,"Back to back hikes. I never do this unless I am staying in the woods overnight. But training days are short and I have lots of catching up to do. Shoot by now Bonnie and I would have done half dozen hikes close to 10 miles or so. These 4.5 milers will have to do. Just enough to get our feet wet. 

Literally the trail stands a bit muddy with all this rain. The hiker tracks show many have stepped here in the past days. After seeing thru hikers yesterday I am sure we’ll see more today. 

We have a good little group going. Bon and Jeff, Me, Larry and the kiddos. So glad we all could give it a go today. Jeff played possum and acted like he wasn’t going which put Larry in a better state of mind thinking he was going to nestle back in the bed with his cup-a-joe. NOT April fools. 

Lining up for trail entry it was like old time, Lead dog in front, Anna, TJ, Bonnie and the boys. We hadn’t hardly broke a sweet topping the one and only hill when a call came in from the back…Hey Wait!, Wait Up! Simultaneously Anna and I say the boys are turning back and wanting the keys so they can drink our post hike beverages. Jeff comes clomping along, sole of his shoe half off. Larry jokes he hasn’t hiked in so long his shoes have dry rotted.  “Nothing a few pieces of duct tape can’t fix”.  Retreaded he is off to the falls. No turning back now. 

Speaking of shoes TJ’s are a bit worse for the wear. Their pup has turned them into a chew toy removing the insoles and cutting the strings. They look true hiker worthy.  I’m trying out some new hiker shorts and believe they will do just fine for a long haul. 

Medical report.. the knee is holding up well and the sore toe is not much noticeable. I do take care with my steps still feeling I’m doing ok. My gate will increase with strength. 

Closing in on the falls we hear them roar. Should be a good show. But heck we have our own entertainment….Shoeless Jeffrey…he’s now in need of medical attention. Larry pulls out his kit and a snoopy band-aid. This looks quite cute stuck to the top of Jeff’s balled brown noggin. Pretty good scrap he has up there having nocked the skin clean off. Bonnie you have a high maintenance man on your hands girl. 

Anna leads us to the falls ready for a snack. A few hikers are camped down here and some are coming out from checking things out. Talk turns quick to summer time hikes here and swimming. These waters are quite cold now but I’d bird bath it. Photo ops, snacks, hiker introductions and more photos, it’s a busy place here for a minute. 

Returning to our junction it’s time to decide more miles or not. I will have a good 4.6 today if we head on back. We all know the boy’s vote….”we’ll see ya at the car!”  My instinct is to turn back and keep it on a high note. There will be more days to pull off longer miles.  It’s not about the miles but about the smiles. 

PS> Back at the care it was Trail magic on the fly…we had a few hikers looking for “which way to Trent’s Store” and Do they have a good hiker resupply. All you need fellas to get you to Pearisburg. Here have a cold brew.  These 3 seemed willing to take all the time in the world they needed as they were already ahead of schedule. Hurry on up and we’ll see ya in Maine, HA!","Kimberling Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589418,"The Explorer was loaded down this weekend. Hiker Hauler full of packs and people. We have 2 newbies to hike McAfee for their first time and they both are extremely excited. Tiny Dancer (Rebekah), Bonnie’s grand-daughter  and Low Key (Leslie), TJ’s sister are back with us.  

Watching the ATC website and local news the trail opened up the end of the week after a large section very close to the AT was in flames. Driving up 311 we could see the black forest, the fire had come right next to the road for over several miles. Gather up our gear, rain gear included – if your bring it you won’t need it. Sun shines bringing smiles to our faces. 

The Kiddy Four Pack leads us in. Yes Lead Dog is gonna settle back with Bonnie for a more steady pace up this mountain. We can look at the flowers right? And that we did…new money plant with it purple décor line the trail. Oh wow check out these pink lady slippers!! 

TJ has the young ladies right on his heals checking over his shoulder every now and again to make sure we are not far behind. Once I get warmed up we close in as they have slowed their pace to help close the gap. 

Having the trail to ourselves was a real treat. With just a few cars in the parking lot some are way ahead of us either camping and hiking back to their car.  Rounding the next corner the smell of cinders and ash feel our noses…the fire has come up to here?  Surprising us a few fire fighters are still here, telling us they have come in each day at 7am, some working till 7pm.  Thanks so much guys and gals for keep us safe and our trail intact.  A ridge runner also talks with us just up the way. Hey I saw you on the news this week. He’s like you did, how did I do? He explains how the fire was contained by starting a low burn just beside the trail to push the flames downhill to the road. Nothing across the trail was touched. 

By this time we are starting to greet a few early bird hikers coming off the knob. More sun and more effort too to reach the “big rock”, Bonnie’s landmark to determine we are very close to the top. She recalls the introduction of Jeff and Topper along this section. Huffing and puffing Jeff had given detailed trail co-ordinates for over a mile or so and was running out of breath just about here. 

I myself feeling pretty good about now am excited to crest and go see the wonder overlook over Catawba Valley.  Come on Bonnie let’s go live girl and tell everyone!!!  

Our bunch gathers right to best setting ledge but in a safe distance from McAfee’s edge. High clouds cast shadows along the valley and ridges. I point out Tinker Cliffs, the edge of Carvin’s Cove, and the Peaks of Otter way off in the distance.  An all breath taking view today.  

Leslie is having some tightness in her back so TJ pulls out the trusty mat and blows up for sister to stretch out on.  He has carried their and Anna’s food and drinks up and Anna trades for the carry off when the pack gets lighter. Hey anyone wanna carry my stuff?  Actually I did pack a little extra weight for training and so far I’m making it ok. Inside hamstring is tight so I get my stretch out too and will do so again on the way down with the knee gets some weak.  

The entertainment of the day was an oriental couple who came up for their first look. We took pictures for them and many others. Rotating turns out on the ledge for that best shot we all take our turn.  Anyways he scooted out as far as he can go with legs dangling off and hands in the air as she is yelling oriental words to him which I’m pretty sure were instructions to back that shit up. Click click I could hear her talking photos as I waiting my turn to take photos for some section hiker dudes. Well when he walked back to see how they turned out none of her snaps took. “Jesus Quiist” he whales out. Ah you funny man, we laughed ourselves clean off the mount. 

Come on Lead dog it’s your time to lead Anna says. Are we going off the fire road she asks? Well it would add some to this trip if we take it from the very top so let’s do AT half way down and fire road the rest. Rebekah and Anna are with me and Bonnie, Leslie and TJ are in a small group. I try to take my normal stride but the down has me short stepping some. Both knees hurt some but that’s just age and getting back into shape. Suck it up Buttercup!

Winding back to the fire road many more hikers are in coming. Hope that black cloud passes or some are gonna get wet. TJ proclaims it ain’t  happenin.  We are bunched up now and again has the woods to ourselves. Rebekah is already talking of where we can hike next…Rock Castle Gorge!!! NO way I hear from Bonnie…Anna chimes in…uhhh maybe the week I am out you can go Martha….hahah. I’m not ready yet myself but in a few weeks YES we’ll be going. So many trails so little time.

Approaching the parking lot we pass one of the fire crew from this morning. He confirms their job is done here. And our hike is done here too. Thanks again for keeping the trail passable and safe.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590441,"Hiker, Hiker, Hiker, one by one they crossed the road as I pulled in to my parking place early this Saturday morning. 9am and all’s bright and sunny. A bit warm but loving it.  I’m lone wolfing it today and picked this location since I saw the Konnarock Crew would be working this area. A good back up plan just in case the old knee(s) decide to give me trouble, I’ll have help in shouting distance. And as I can see many hikers coming by for a helping hand if the case lends.  I’d normally not give it a care in the world but Larry had asked I go someplace with cell service and of course I wanted to go someplace where there was a good climb so this is a good compromise.

I have the pull of place to myself and leave all the room in the world for many others to come join. Walking down the road I see someone has left a trail magic cooler. It is full of trash, no magic left. Quick I think over the items I can hand out from my pack and of course some after trail beverages one can enjoy. That’s it I’ll be a traveling magic man.

Climbing the first field has the heart pumping and legs burning. Train Train…Maine Maine. My pace feels some slower than my norm but working towards that. Cross the next road the ATC van is here, KONNAROCK. I bet they are tearing up this mountain and making some nice switchbacks for us. I saw pink ribbons tied to trees back in the winter and wondered when the crew was coming. 

Approaching closer to the Keffer Oak’s location I run into some of the hikers I saw crossing 42. First up was Barbara Short, because as she said, I’m short. 65 year old lady from Georgia doing big sections of Virginia, 5 days at a time. Her hiker friend backed out the night before they were to leave. She was not happy about it but buckled up her pack and came on. Retired podiatrist who knew all too well foot and knee pains. He you got an extra shot in that pack for me? She had already administered for her own well-being just a day or so before. 

The big tree is just ahead I say I can take your photo. Excited to see our Southern Gal she smiles. Other hikers are here too getting there snapshots as well. Telling them of my measuring this tree for “exact” comparison to the Dover Oak gets a good laugh from all. Yeah that Damn Yankee beat out our gal by foot or so. They could believe it. 

Come on ya’ll Brusier Knob awaits. Uhhh, one hiker decides the shade here is just fine for now. Georgia, I’ll see you on my return and maybe by then I’ll have you a trail name.

Thinking I had only the work crew to meet now I put my head down a being the arduous trek up the mountain. Switchbacks help but they are only near the bottom and then the trail turns more direct up. Foot steps, I hear them coming from behind, ultra runners. HILL REPEATS? I say out loud. Ah yes we are going up and over to Niday Shelter way aka Craig’s Creek Road and back. Kick it boys. One was training for the same race Jim ran in last October, The Grindstone 100. Oh hell yeah I say. I crewed that race like I was some big shot. Ha. Well I fessed up and told him what I really did and how I was about as tired as Jim was by the time I got home. 

Still no work crew yet, they must be on the other side of the mountain…but more hikers!! Hey gals how it going? Panting we all take the moment to introduce and pass one another. With my day pack on I have the advantage and take their lead but we all walk along together getting to know one another. NH gal and her neighbor friend are here are hiking home. They are liking VA but Firefly has shin splints and is dropping back from us once we crest the ridge. Earth-heart says she likes my pace and will settle in behind me and walk out to my turn around spot and wait on her friend. They are averaging 17 miles a day and are looking forward to Daleville. Little Pigs BBQ and new shoes. 

Earth-heart is amazed at the time I have put into the trail and trying to finish it. Section Hikers Rock ya know. Come see us in the parade next weekend, Trail Days. Oh they plan to double back. She worked at Lake of the Clouds hut in the White Mountains. Wow what a day job I said. Well you already have one up all others who haven’t hiked your state. It ate me alive missy and I’m still recovering. 

History lessons of the Sarver homestead and what lies ahead in our great state I shared. Don’t get water here at the junction unless you are completely out, it’s a workout for it, .4 of a mile to be exact. Come on let’s take lunch on this nice big log.

Trail magic time, would you like a banana? Oh would I she says. I wished I’d packed the new bunch I just bot. Let me take your trash too. Firefly come in looking a bit worn. Those shins are hurting. I can relate to walking pain. It makes for a long day. So far mine has been pretty light on that side but my hike down shall tell the real story. 

Speaking of story it’s time to go LIVE.  They smile and hear me tell my followers of our adventure today. Come on Lead Dog you can lead us on to Niday I like your pace…oh my I wish I could but it is now time for me to return from which I came. Happy trails, see you in Damascus.

The ridge return was nice and relaxing. Here comes Georgia gal. Smiles. Well here you are again she says. How far to Sarver? You are close the other gals will see you at the shelter. They will be holding up for Niday instead of Pickles. Smiles and so long.

Girls outnumbered the fellas 5 to 1. I offered my next lady water as she seemed quite down when I asked you headed to Maine? Her reply, “Somedays YES and today well I just don’t know”.  Oh you got this, take a sip, trek on and have a great day.

My down is here now, the other side of Bruisers Knob. Step ouch, step ouch. Old knees hurt but I am managing and trying methods to take the pressure off. Short strides and side stepping to take the direct hit off the knee. Before I know it I’m back to those sweet smelling fields and the heat of the day. 

I lost count of the rest of the hikers I met still yet. All excited to be reaching the Oak and me excited to be reaching my road. Gazing over the last field I take it in. Oh how good it feels to be right here right now. Just being a hiker hiker hiker.","Rt. 42 Sinking Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591272,"Finally marching in this great event for my own year of completion. ""Hopefully"" 2008-July 2018. Sale and Mary Sue provided a famous Fish, Nemo to march along with us. Thanks so much ladies for sharing in the fun.  Sporting our rocker tee shirts and cardboard guitars we marched and fired our water guns at the crowd as they cheered us and all along our way thru town. Captain provided extra fire power shooting his fire extinguishers. ""Do shoot unless fired upon"" and yes we mostly got fired upon. Tiny Pants and Smalls joined us for the first time handling the wagon and Nemo.  

After the parade it was time to travel up to tent city and win some drawings. And win our group did. Bonnie ""Steadfast"" came away with a Gregory pack, SlimJim won a full set of gear from the Backpacker booth and we all won toss away prizes, tee shirts, small totes and various goodies.
Tom and Sandy provided a great reason to cut out from this hot and steamy environment and get back for a 7:00 supper. Hamburgers and hotdogs grilled up with the help of Denny and Noni with all sorts of potluck sides. We had a feast. 

Before the next rain hit a fire was started with all sorts of fun passed around. Easy don't knock the bottom out of that one, fire in the hole!  No fire ring for us this year or rocking by the pavilion, too many storms a gatherin. Let's just rock the night away on the front porch swing.","Damascus VA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592247,"Should I stay or should I go? Rain, No Rain? Sun?? Oh my better make hay with the sun shines. I gather up my hiking gear and out the door I go heading for the perfect quick trail access and with none other than a steep climb. 

The tree setters over on Peters Mountain was my first thought but with no hiking partners today thought better of that since I don’t know the full situation over that way. Would there be other protestors over the Mountain Valley Pipeline? Would there be law enforcement? Uh I’ll stay on this side of the mountain and be amongst the angels.

Arriving to the Narrow Rd parking lot a tent is set up and by the looks of this Henry Shires version, has to be a thru hiker. I wave as I park and decide to start off with a little magic. Would you like a banana for breakfast? Oh the eyes lit up. I saw second pair of shoes and asked if another would care for one. Thank you Thank you. The two young men were from Maine. “oh man I know your rocky state” Wishing them a safe trip home I start my hike.

Rain from the night before has the trail glistening. Greenery pops and seems to swallow me whole while I plunge in deeper. All uphill from here, approximately 2100 feet worth. This should be a good test on the knee(s) on the way back. 

Feeling pretty good I am getting stronger each week. Birds sing to me and then I hear some hikers approaching. A couple from Ireland…Highlander…I tell them of meeting him last year in Maine and hope they make it too. They love Virginia and the hospitality received. When I tell them of my sectioning the AT the fellow says that’s one way to eat an elephant! Another couple comes along and can’t wait to eat a big breakfast in town. Many others are met all the way on my climb to Rt 634 road. Actually this isn’t too much of a steep climb since the ATC has relocated this part over switchbacks.

A truck flies by with a load of hikers in the back. Guess they just got picked up and are heading into Angels Rest Hostel. Catching my second wind it’s time to get to scratchin.

Pasty trail has my shoes almost getting sucked off my feet. All this rain! Speaking of feet mine are always suspect.  I am trying a new insert in the heel to alleviate a tendon issue that has come up in the last week. I have to put one in each shoe so not to through me out of line. Hummm, seems that’s already happened. I’ll know more about how these work after coming off of here.

Oh how the trail changes with the seasons. Mostly we hike in the winter/spring and have no foliage, all open forest. You can see your progress. Not today. Have I come to the steep part yet? Seems it’s all been steep. It’s like a sauna in here. My glasses fog up and sweat drips from my brow. Gatorade, wew lets stop for a swig.

Finally I see the rhododendron line. Perfect, only a few more twists of the trail and I’ll be at the top. Pink bloom fill in between the haze of the weather. The rocks, the rest is just ahead. Cold air seeps from the building like boulders which lead me to the overlook. Blue blazes and colorful flowers line the path then the open view over the New River can be seen. Peaceful. High stormy clouds still hang around and part briefly with a hint of blue sky to show. 

Not sure if I’ll hike on out for a longer trek or not I don’t tarry. One more slight grade and I’m officially on Wilburn Ridge. Oh and is it covered with more spring blooms. Flame Azalea pops along with more rhodies. Darker clouds come over. Hold on rain’s I still have one last overlook to take in and have a snack. 

Setting on the ledge I watch storm clouds pass one by one. I drip with sweat and guzzle more Gatorade. A group of section hikers come by. Packed like I used to carry they are headed to the Ribble Trail junction.  I checked the weather guys and seems a heavy front will hit around 2:00, it’s almost 12 now. Hope you make it close to your camp before it arrives. With this in mind I fold my thoughts of extra miles and just concentrate on a solid safe hike out. 

Down down I go. Sun breaks out as I hit the steepest sections providing some light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Gripping sticks tighter than usual I try to keep my feet underneath me. Shit this is slick. Side stepping to keep pressure off one knee and then the other seems to work pretty well. Heck they both gonna hurt these days. Just a fact. 

A song breaks out in my head..Standing on Shaky Ground..yep that’s me. I’m standing on shaky ground. Knees knocking but didn’t fall. Soon I’m back at the road and what do we have here, a group of hikers getting dropped off. Hello I holler out. Hey we saw you this morning. Ha, how funny. This same bunch was the truck load from this AM. They have dried out, eaten, ready to pick up where they left off. England, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin all represented. I’m from right over the hill headed back to my care. A section hiker one presumes. Yes I am, slackin ain’t cheatin. Ah yes they agree and ask if I’d like to lead the way. Oh no my friends you thru hikers hike faster with full packs that any old section hiker can. You carry on and I shall fall in behind. 

And follow I did keeping up with them pushing myself actually to beat those knees just a little more on this last part down. Their peloton moving along and Lead Dog bringing up the rear. Ah yes my group and I will be doing the same soon.  Reaching the parking lot they wave so long disappearing in the woods as I end my day on a dry and happy note.","Narrows Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593014,"Time for the first shake down hike of the season.  Shake downs are for what’s in the pack you really need and what you really don’t.  And for me this will be what I’m able to do and what I’m really not able to do “yet”!  I’ve packed conservatively not putting all I might take to Maine but what I will only need on this trip. My ULA is comfortable loaded at 16 pounds with food, shelter, water oh and knee brace I have yet to wear and hope I don’t.

Slim Jim sent the word out to his PATH group for any takers in joining us and he did have one in for the game, Dwight Levi from Wilkesboro. He has hiking over half of the trail up to PA I believe he said and has been a trail maintainer for 16 years. A good seasoned sole. 

We all meet up at The Barn in Groseclose and drop a car at Rt. 617, Davis Cemetery parking. We’ll hike back to this location over the next two days. On to South Fork parking.

Anxious to get to hiking I am a bit nervous.  I want to do well. I haven’t felt this way since our first big trip to CT and having to ride on the train. Damn what’s wrong with me? Jim tells me to lead on and get this hike started.

9:30am we have 12 miles to hike today my longest since October’s miles in PA. Dwight falls in behind me and then Jim takes sweeper talking at a pace I try to hike to. Ha we top that first little hill and level out to settle the nerves. Leg is tight and adjusting to a fuller pack. This long grade up will be best for me to adjust than powering down hill, that sorta still hurts.

Conversation runs the full gamut from family, where ya been, where ya goin, to can’t wait to have pizza for lunch. Yes we plan to order pizza delivery to Partnership Shelter/Mt Rogers Rangers Station. 

So far the trail has been pretty easy with quite the wet track.  Rains last night have it pasty in some parts but very manageable.  Reaching the mountain dirt road of 601 we have snack and a rest. 4 miles down and 4 more to the shelter. 

Meeting some hikers now.  Section hikers and day.  It’s National Trail Days ya know. Better be out rather than in. 

More mud these next 4 miles. Dwight and Jim critique the maintenance and call off those in charge of each section we are hiking. Clean up that water bar. Shore up this and that. I stomp along without judgement and enjoy their banter. 

Pizza time, Partnership Shelter is in sight. A couple of thru-hikers are here having their break. Kicking off my shoes to dry out the socks and air the toes in the sun feels fantastic. Feet are feeling great. A hiker named City says he knows the Captain and was at the hiker in 2014. He really appreciated the food and hopes Captain is doing well.

After getting our 2 large pizzas ordered (yes 2 we want leftovers) we browse the ranger’s station. Stuffed bear, turtles, foliage and fawn. Nice and cool in here but better not get too used to this cause its good and hot outside. After all the clouds cleared from earlier it has become quite steamy.

Two pies right here please. Ouch it’s burning my fingers but hey I can still take a bite that cheese won’t stick to the top of my mouth.  Slice by slice it disappears. Say we gonna have any leftovers? 3 pieces! I’ll pack them up for ya Jim and you can carry it :o)

Heading out for our next 4 miles we wonder if eating that one last piece each was really worth it. Glad the first mile was not up like the remaining 3 gonna be I may have just popped.  Brushy Mountain has us burning off those calories and working up a shiny sweat.  Down to the foot of Locust Mountain only to climb back up has me ready for our camp.  Could I hike 4 more miles? Well sure if I hadta but I don’t so there. 

Jim and Dwight have been perfect trail guides giving minute by minute locations and landmarks. I haven’t looked at my map but once and that was at lunch. Camp is just down this rocky grade. How’s those knees? They are talking but they are walking.

Jonathan’s white blaze marks the campsite area. Nice, several places for tents and tarps and a fire ring. Camp set let’s get some water and start that cocktail hour, its 5 o’clock somewhere. 

This is the start of Jim’s section he maintains. He has put up a nice sign for water which by the way wasn’t noted well in the trail guides.  So now my hiking friends come fill your canteen from this easy flow pipe.  Parched I guzzle a good bit from my stash. 

Cocktails and camp stories while the sun sets to warm us. How can I be hungry? Supper time. Dwight has supper going before I can get my stuff organized he’s ready to chow too. Toasts and more stories with one such it lends to a new trail name, Complacent. Yes Dwight your golf game is failing just because you are just too damn complacent as his story goes. He is an easy going fella and it just seems to fit. Maybe it’s that brandy in hand. 

Not quite dark 30 but its hiker midnight calling. I’m ready to stretch out and listen to the night birds. But remember we did camp near this forest road and it is the weekend. Just as we are about to stop talking thru our tents/tarps the traffic begins. One truck…then later another…boy I sure hope this doesn’t go on all night. Most of all hope then don’t see our bear bag rope hanging with food bags and decide to take target practice. 

That night bird starts singing and then the squawk of a screech owl. Okay that’s my que this night is now complete nothing left now to do but sleep.","South Fork Holston

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593162,"Is that rain popping on my tent or just tree debris? When I was falling asleep last night little twigs kept hitting the tent but now I do believe this is some rain. It’s too early to get up I’ll just turn back over and maybe it will go away. Thirty more minutes is all it took before nature called and well time to get up. I slept clammy, hot on minute and chilled the next with sweat. Peeping out my tent Dwight has his hat on a guess that’s a sign he’s ready to get up. Jim is tucked in tight but makes some sounds to acknowledge he is awake. Fog fog but what no rain? It was just some light wind causing wetness to fall. Sleeping almost at the top of the mighty Glade Mountain has us in the clouds. 

I get most of my gear packed up inside my tent just in case this fog means rain and ready myself for a warm meal for breakfast.  Yes I planned to cook for breakfast on this trip to try new Mountain House meals given away at Trail Days. Last night’s chili mac and cheese was really good. 1 serving was just right. Now I have scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes, cheese, pork sausage, green pepper and onions. Man this is good, ketchup? That’s all I need or some tabasco. Dwight cooks up his meal and toasts a leftover Burger King cresant while Slim Jim stays ultralight gnawing on a cliff bar and cold coffee. 

Camp broke down time to hike the mighty Glade. Jim begins his narrative on his section. I never know a plane had crashed on top of this mountain killing 17 on board. 4000 some feet we’ll be approaching. This is the short side we already climbed most of our elevation yesterday. Watch out for “that rock” up ahead that’s the slick one. Which rock they all are wet and slick? Branches start to encroach on either side of the trail. Hey who is maintaining this trail? They need to cut this stuff back!! Dwight and I hit Jimmy hard with snide remarks on his duties. “I was just up here no more than a week or so ago, how can this be needing repairs?”  he says. Ah this is better than fighting our way on those NY/NJ paths that were like walking thru a hedge. No worries Jim you got this place in good order. 

Cresting the ridge all the mountain opens wide but the fog keeps any views from us. However pinks and orange of blooming flowers makes for a nice contrast.  See that blue ribbon, that where I marked off so hikers wouldn’t think this was part of the trail. Jim continues his trail reports and then introduces us to the summit 4093 feet and his pretty sign. All summits need a sign!!!

Let the down begin to our next destination, Louise Chatfield Shelter, named for the founder of the PATH division.  Jim’s shelter now. Say will they remain this in your honor someday Jim?  I haven’t walked this section in quite some time so good to give it try again now. The knees recognize the down.

Stopping for a snack some maintenance of the fire pit we can see the blue sky now and what a nice day it’s shaping up to be. We’ll take the proposed re-route thru the Settlers Museum  and homeplace. Jim would like to see “his” trail moved from going underneath a large electrical town to route thru this historic section. Sounds perfect. And there is parking and a pavilion for those to enjoy too. But this must be approved by the powers of the ATC.  

We check in at the Lindamood School and see magic has been left and partake. Less than 4 miles left in our 8.5 day. Easy walking now just one small up at the railroad tracks to the field. Only some muddy trail here to slow us down. Jim you need to get some gravel in here to harden this up. 

Highway sounds come in ear shot. Interstate in full view while we hike thru the fields closing back into ‘town’.  Cold sodas call us from the Exxon. Only a mile to go let’s have a drink our trip leader says. Hot sun pours down on us. Glad we are winding down this day just before noon. Gonna be a steamy. 

Lead us onward Dwight. Your turn to show us the way. Another easy stretch I hadn’t hiked in some time. It was nice to see from this direction and time of year.  Davis Path Cemetery is just to your right and our final destination just ahead. Wow we are already here. Guess that tour guide made the time just fly. It’s been great guys!!! Wooo wait Lead Dog we have more maintenance to address. Not before I pop a beer first.  The fellas plan to move an old sign showing the road number that’s pointing in a no viewable way.  

Cheers to a great shake down hike. You fellas go right on and dig that post hole.","USFS 86

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593716,"Our adventure takes place at a place we’ve all hiked. Some more than others. Some hike this loop looking for a challenge and some hike to find out they’ll never have the need to hike it again. This 10.8 mile loop covers every type of terrain available in these parts from farm land field walks, to parkway views, to stream following trail to gorge passage with deep descents and hard rock heart pumping ascents. It has it all and we intend to hike it full circle back to back days. 

Loop 1 starts us with Jimmy’s truck left at the top parking area of the campground. Our normal starting point but since we plan to camp we have reserved spots for us 4 in the lower more primitive camping area near the creek for options to grill and fish. Before we begin our hike we’ve loaded up in my rig to transport us and all our goodies to the bottom of the gorge. The trail days wagon is chocked full of coolers full of food and beverages, cooking items, an ax, tarps etc. This little hike in to drop camping gear will add about a ½ mile to our hike. Every step counts.

Marking our spots for tents we lay out tarps and claim a fire pit and bear box. Hope no one takes my wagon, we leave it here too. One other tent is set up and some other campers are packing up to move on. 

We return to my rig to put on packs to begin our ascent from the gorge. All of us are pre-packed with full gear as if we were ready to leave for Maine. Shack down hikes are very important to training we have learned and this two day hike will tell the truth if we are ready. 

Lined up at the bottom we look at each other, who’s gonna go first? Normally I would without hesitation just go, Lead Dog, go. Well I’m not as fast as I used to be and give others the option. Get us started Martha, get this train moving. 

Trail gives us a mile to warm up before turning crazy steep but still up is up and I am sweating quickly. It’s a hot humid day with thunderstorms called for mid afternoon. We started around just before 10am. Maybe we can beat them to camp. 

Slow and steady we’ve made it past those first few burst of climbs and cuts between gorge edges, crossing stream run offs between each. My pack is fully felt about now and I’m doing a checklist in my head of what can possibly go. Anna is hot on my heels, where is the top of this thing? See those rocks that marks the hardest and almost getting to better hiking ground. Wew I’m melting. Let’s just stop at Jim’s truck once we get there and call this a day!
 
Pushing and puffing we get past the worst of it and take a break at the big cut log. I remember this spot from years ago. A giant downed tree we used to have to climb over but trail crew cut is and there’s some setting room at this bend in the trail. Gummy bears and beer boy would that be good as I eat a handful of this sweet candy and suck down Gatorade I had poured into a side bottle I am carrying. 

A little family comes hiking to us headed for the gorge we just came up. They will be some strong hiking kids if they keep this up. Packs back on time to get our train moving again, next stop the benches at the top of the next couple of ups. 
Catawba rhododendrons have dropped their small blooms like bread crumps to show us the way. I probably could have counted them all having my head down pumping along to get to those benches trying to keep my thoughts from how tight my leg is. The healing process is going just fine but this type pain is persistent and nagging. It gets much worse on the downhill and we really haven’t had any of that yet today. 

Cresting at the last bench we take a quick water break and I stretch. Quick stepping needed now for the slight down and soon we hear the parkway traffic. Hey wait for us, I’ll take a ride. Haha. Jimmy talks about his last training loop runs over here and trying to shortcut from the trail to the road to yellow blaze. It was o’dark-thirty and he got caught up in a fence he didn’t see when making this quick decision. Shit barbed wire. Yikes. He made it thru but will not try that. 

The field the field…hot damn we’ve made it out. Get me to that truck and a cold drink. Water it will have to be. If I get in to our reserves now I’ll just drop from this race. Jim has packed extra water for anyone needing to reload and a Gatorade. The one shade tree in “our “area we hit and cool down. Let’s wait for lunch till we get to the top of the fields. Even out of the gorge we have about 2 miles more of climbing yet.

Anna and TJ have hiked this but it’s been a while. They are ready and on Jim’s heels now with me taking sweeper. Hot and hazy it remains. Photo op at the big tree in the middle of this wide open ridge is a must. 

The next up Rocky Knob shelter, where the AT used to access. Long ago the AT ran this parkway ridge. Bright red Indian paint brush line the trail all around this old rock and slab structure. Wew too hot for me to set up in here. Let’s move on up to the next overlook. More day hikers out. This group from Michigan. We don’t cut in on their visit but say hello and move along. 

Cutting more along the edge of the ridge now we turn down finally and begin the rest of the overlook walks, at least 5 more from this point, all of which cut in and out along the parkway for car access if you liked. 

Pondering at the Saddle Overlook which backups with a view of Buffalo Mountain we see dark storm clouds gathering and a rain line coming over a far ridge. Should we stay or should we go? Anna make a compromise let’s set here and eat and see what the storm does. TJ has his samich in hand in like 2 seconds and is ready for his lunch. I just start to prepare mine and see the rain line fast approaching. Uhh guys look…we grab up and haul over the parkway road for one of many shelter areas. I’ve never been to this one and it could handle a 50 plus crowd I do believe.

Wind picks up but still no rain. We are under cover and finish our lunch and decide 30 more minutes. Phone service is bad so checking the radar isn’t an option. So a 1:30 stop turns to 2:00. Let’s walk back up and see if we can tell more from where we left off.

Still threatening we decide to trek on. In and out of the woods and overlooks and then it comes. Big rain drops, wind. Pack covers on and quick stepping begins. What are we doing here? Jim says. Anna has stopped under the cover of the trees, TJ close behind. Jim with umbrella, yes he carries for such occasion and to keep the sun off too. Hurry up here we can hit this next side path to another station, the Rocky Knob visitors center. Under the awning of the little building we have full view of the ridge lines and storm direction. 

From a hot mess we are now in rain jackets and ready to do jumping jacks for warmth. 2:30 turns to 3:00 as we watch lightening and hear the thunder. Thousand one Thousand two.  Rain and less rain and then more rain come and go. Motorcyclists come and go getting on rain gear for travel. Some staying under cover as long as us. Maybe we should just camp here we joke with the ranger as he rolls his eyes. Plan B, we hitch a ride to the winery Jim says. They serve all day. Anna, just 30 more minutes. 3:30 now Plan C I hitch a ride on the back of one of these bikes and go get the truck.

Finally the ceiling lifts and the sun pops out. Blue skies behind us. Lets go…but it’s still raining….we’ll walk ourselves dry, come on. 3:45 time to hike we got burgers to grill and bean patties to toss. If we stay here much longer we’ll be eating tomorrow’s lunch.

Not sure on how many miles we have left we are guessing 5-6. Plenty of time to reach before dark but much later in the day than we intended. This will cut into fishing and cocktail hour.

The kids are off to the races Jimmy close behind and we’ll it’s a lot of down and the gal will just gonna have to step it at her pace. I have them in sights. Floydfest field crossed and baking sun is now upon us. Turning into the woods and is nice and look who’s waiting at the style, TJ to make sure I’m across the slippery mud and the style ok. 

The trail here is side hill with short ups and downs. Winds in and out of the gaps of the mountain. We all make good time of this and before we know it we’ve hit the Castle. The landmark of the gorge. Jim leads our way. TJ says we should just go off trail here and really practice for Maine. It is a full on rock scramble up there but thankfully the trail here doesn’t challenge us quite that way. Rocks are still wet from the rain and we take care with footing…till..bam! I’m on my ass feet straight up in the air like I’d been clipped by a linebacker. Hard down on my left arm and hip. Shit that’s gonna leave a mark. 

Well it left two. Jim helps me up and nothing seems broken just 2 big hen eggs pop up on the underside of my forearm. Some blood, sweat, and pride hurt. Crap what’s burning? Stinging nettles!!!  My extremes where all in them for a brief moment and that’s all it takes. Anna exams the arm for movement. Elbow good, fingers good let’s roll. I can wash off at the chimney area. 

That we do and reach our next sign to tell us 2.6 to camp. All fireroad walk from here. Easy right?  Well it hadn’t been 20 minutes and we are crossing a bridge, a nice new one that I am telling of not being here some years ago and then being a full on water fall area, then wooop, right foot does a slippy slide out and I’m flying face forward, sticks fly out and I hold out that left arm to catch myself all the while trying to keep the hand hitting first so not to butcher up that forearm again. Look out ya’ll she’s down again. WTF!!! I say. I’m ticketed now. No damn since in falling like this. The bunch is in full on belly laughs as they realize I’m ok and mad. You gotta hold those guard rails from now on Martha, Anna tells me. Uggg.

Wide road and time to air it out. Anna busts trail and is ready for camp. The fellas hang with me some and as we close in to camp we being gathering firewood. Anything not deep underbrush that might be good tender. 

6:15 we reach camp. Miller time folks. YeeeHOOO. No time to set around though it’s getting late and camp chores await.

Sun still shines but not so much in the gorge. Our spots picked did get some sun after the rain and aren’t too wet. Fire pit dug out and Jim’s slicking the ax spitting wood from cut down trees the forestry has worked on. Perfect. They even left big logs for setting so we gather some for our pit. TJ’s the fire master setting up his tender just right all we now is spark. Who’s got a light? Um I didn’t bring my stove, I have no lighter. Um TJ didn’t bring his either. Jim? Anna? As prepared as we mostly are and we don’t have a lighter. I check the other campsites for a possible find. Digging deep in one of his packs Jim pulls out a crusty lighter that won’t even turn over. It has fluid we can make this work. Flick Flick. I can’t flick the Bick!! Fish hook what about a hook to open the hole maybe it’s dried up. Flick Flick…Flame. Wewww that was close we’d been eating hamburger tartar. 

Fire is lit, tents go up, time to fish before it’s dark. Swish swish TJ casts his fly line. I ready myself to tape the action. Shit he’s got one…reeling it in and nice little brown trout emerges. The day is complete. 
Let’s eat.

No we didn’t eat the fish he was too little for all that. But maybe next time. Cocktails and snacks while the fire coals get good and hot. Bean burgers hit the pan first. Homemade at that. Jim’s special for he and Anna. Real meat for me and TJ. Thick and juicy they take some time to cook thru but worth the wait. Stacked high with lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, and pickles. When we do it we do it right!  

Our neighboring campers have gone to Floyd for Mexican. Too far to drive out we say. Besides we can’t be out all night we have loop 2 tomorrow and Jimmy has 2 of 3 yet to do. He will get up at 4:30am and we’ll break camp and while he comes around. Breakfast is scheduled after at Tuggles Gap Restaurant. 

Bellies full we enjoy our fire recalling our day of challenges. It was electric, it was hard, it was filling, it was fun. Let’s do it all again tomorrow.","Rocky Knob Campground

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593953,"Fire-light still flickers thru my tent or is that a head lamp? It’s both. Jim stirs 4:30am. Hearing his coke can open and him gather stuff to begin is loop 2 fun run of the gorge. He’s been in ultramarathon mode for over a year now completing his first 100 mile race and many other prep races. Now it’s training time for upcoming events and Maine. Run Jimmy Run.  I turn over to get more sleep.

Morning birds call us to wake. I left my rain fly open all night to keep from getting all clammy like last week. I slept cool and comfy. Fog is high on the mountain above the tree tops here. No dew either, to low in the gorge for that. Another tent has sprung up in the night. We turned in about 9:30pm so they came in after that. 6:30am now. We three will break camp and have the wagon loaded for when Jim comes back around and then all hike out. Tuggles Gap Restaurant for breakfast. 10am tentative hike time for our group back to back loop.

Taking our time packing up TJ stokes the fire and flame is ready to boil water for coffee. That’s gonna be strong, an inch or more of grounds await.  I’ll stick to my water and crystal light orange. 

Stretching and applying my new knee grease I ready myself for the hike. Legs are feeling pretty good. Bumps and bruises are black and blue but swelling and gone down. Yes!  

Just about the time we have the wagon loaded TJ spots Jim coming down the road. Woop woop here he comes folks kickin ass running strong to the finish line. 8:00am  FKT (Fastest Known Time)  Elated to be here before 9:30am he says. Going up the gorge in the dark was quite to feat and reaching his truck at day break gave him that  needed pep in his step to begin running those flatter sections and make great time. Now to get him rested a bit, us refueled, and do it all over again.

If you’ve never eaten at Tuggles Gap give it a try. My first visit and I will go back. Good selection on the breakfast menu with us all getting something different. They serve lunch and cold brews. No wonder the place has cycles and car out front most of the time. Just a short drive from our location too.

9:45am time get those packs back on for another round. I ponder do I ditch a thing or stay with the game plan of hiking with full pack. Anna goes with option #1, no tent going with her. OUT!  Humm she temps me but hey I won’t know how I’ll do unless I just do it. 

Eager to start but not too early we head for the field at exactly 10am.  TJ and Anna lead our way. We see a couple just ahead at the big tree. Since we already had our picture here yesterday we ask if we can take theirs but they live local and have many.  Shocked at our mission to hike this another day they really turn over their eyes when we boast of Jim’s fun run this morning. 

Hiking from the upper parking lot will put us in an easier start but will leave us the climb out of the gorge for last of the day. Hope I have what it takes in the tank.  

Reaching the option to hike to the shelter or the side path to view Buffalo Mountain I suggest to take the side path for another view than yesterday. But in making our turn there was a secondary turn I hesitated on and took the left verses the right and damn if we didn’t snake right back up to the shelter. Oh well we got more up in and provided us a better view from the knob. 

Just like yesterday down down time. I step aside and let my group carry on. Before we know it we’re at our exact spot of where things turned electric yesterday. We fly on past and zip thru all those parkway intersections with the trail. Anna is setting a good pace with TJ close behind. Jim and I are ready for a snack break and I need a leg stretch. 

Stopping at our last field which overlooks the parkway we stop at the large maple. Shade, oh does this feel good. I’m burning up. Sprawled out like we own the place we settle in for a longer than normal rest. High clouds, crisp breeze dries the sweat. I could just stay here all day. Tempting but we must move on.

Radio tower passed, Floydfest field hiked, we turn into the woods and head for the gorge. In and out of the gaps I am glad to be on rolling side verses down. Waiting at the bench before a hard section of down my team waits on me. Yes I’m bringing up the rear but in good measure. Stretch, Stretch. 

You lead Martha, we’ll go your pace here. Will save our legs. HA  Ok steady we go. The gnarly trail bits the knees. There really is not easy way in or out of this gorge. Take your pick which side you wanna go down to only go back up. 

Glad to reach the piney woods section we know there’s easier trail up ahead. Pushing over this foot wide path I’m not runnin but I’m moving this train along. Now this is how I expected this to go yesterday Jim says. We are making great time. 

Arriving at the castle I take extra care with my footing and see the exact rock(s) I busted down on. Not today fellas. And no stopping at the chimney either we got that fire road in sights. I’ll get us to there and I’ll need another stretch time out.  5.2 miles done. 5.6 to go.

Where shall we have lunch? The old farmhouse is settled on as that puts us with less than 4 miles of completion. Watch out for those bridges Martha, hold those guard rails. The trek down is easy walking but pounds the legs and feet so I settle in to my pace and watch my bunch smoke it out. 

Chugging into the Farmhouse front yard TJ gives the thumbs up. Sun boils down on us. Sure hope it doesn’t cook us on the last miles up. How’s that Zach Baker samich Jim? Cheeze on a hamburger bun, a child’s favorite from a day care the kids worked at summers ago. Little fella had one every day of the week. I think this will become a trail favorite. I’d add peanut butter!

Water reloaded and fortified we are off once again. How’s those legs Jim? Big day for you…holding.
Gone in a flash Anna loves this fire road walking. She is out of sight almost only to peep over her shoulder to make sure we are still in sight. 

Last night campsites passed. Everyone packed up but the fishing tent. They must be in for several days.
Three miles to go. Anna you wanna show us the way? Oh no we do better at Lead dog pace. Steady we go. But we have to finish by 3:30, she keeps a tight watch on our hiking time.

Puts the pressure on me to perform as in the past. I’ve hiked this many times and usually head down and straight up. Bust it like its 2010 Martha, no stopping till the top, Jim recalls. 

Pumping, legs feel strong, cardio holding then the heat wells up with the pace. Glad these small streams of water flow in gaps of the gorge. Dip ya hat!!  Turn after turn the trail charges up. Bearing down on my sticks if one where to break I’d fall flat on my face. Knees up in my chest, dig girl dig. Wew I’m breathing flames from not only the heat but my hot seasoned tuna I had for lunch. Fire in the hole!  Sweat drips from nose and my knee caps are sweating. That means HOT!  Just make it to the down tree and we’ll be out of the hardest.  

Yeehoo break time I yell. Guzzling water we try to catching our breath. Glad we stopped here Jim says I was hitting the limit me too.  Regrouped and ready we have a time to make.

A couple more hills in and out of flame azalea, one bench passed, where’s that last one? Parkway sounds yes we are closing in. Ah the feet are feeling it now. Jim recalls off his state of mind here just hours ago and awfully glad to be closing in on the truck. Get ya cold beer, right here, cold beer. Can you hear it?

3:20 we go 10 minutes Martha, go! We’ll make it Anna. Where’s that stile? It marks the field and the finish line. I see it I see it. Hustling across we hit the field 3:34 that will just have to do. Touching the sign for good measure I am so happy to have accomplished our mission. Train for Maine has hit a new level and it feels so good.","Rock Castle Gorge

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594553,"Hustle up Martha you’re gonna be late. I’ve gotten up with what I estimated would be enough time to get my shit together but apparently not. Gas, ice, food get to the trail. We have to get an early start to not only try and beat the heat but allow me time to finish 16 miles before dark. 

Anna and TJ wait on me at Craig’s Creek road and off we go as I spin by. We’ll drop my car at our starting point, Sarver Hollow, and then drive down to where the trail crosses on Craig’s Creek road between Niday Shelter and Audie Murphy’s Monument. Big miles planned at 16.2 with two big climbs to try and replicate some Maine madness.

This will be a two shift day, with the kiddos with me in the am and Bonnie on the evening shift. Anna has to work tonight so hiking 8.8 miles will quite enough and trying to work out some shut eye before her shift starts tonight. Bonnie will get me up the Brushy Mountain to see Audie.

Hot already this morning. Full pack, liter of water, little extra food and side bottle of Gatorade, I’m still trying to keep it as light as I can.  Might be 18 pounds, I didn’t have time to weigh it. Kids are day packed with a little extra so I will surely be the slow link.  

Heads down we start up the side trail. Anna keep track on your watch for how far it “really” is to Sarver Shelter so we’ll know. Estimate is a mile. The trail books have the distance from the shelter to the AT at .4 of a mile. It all feels more than 2 miles when climbing.

Each step turns the wick up on the leg and lung burn. We try to talk a bit but I need my breath for surviving this pull. Listen for the water that means we’re getting close to the old ruins. No water too dry yet. All the leaf cover and under growth make it difficult to see way ahead. Stepping across what would have been water run off we are here. Two rock chimneys stand tall and true while all the old house structure had dilapidated away. A hard living this Sarver clan carved out of this mountain.  The water source is sparse and looks like a lot of work if I had to attain. Most thru hikers pass this up and move on for Niday Shelter where we shall pass by later. 

Stopping at the shelter Anna and TJ measure the hike at 1 mile. This is a great shelter TJ notices and how clean. You can tell not much activity happens here at .4 off the trail. But as a local would be fine place to hike in and camp for a next day hike about.  

Ok let’s knock out this last .4 up and start following those white blazes.  

Ridge greets us with a nice breeze and sunny skies. In and out of the woods, across rock ledges and hot pockets of warmth. Glad we aren’t in full sun all this time we’d be burnt up. We snacked at our first best view which was fairly clear so we could see McAfee Knob and even the Peaks of Otter way to our north. 

Bees and birds check in to let us know they are here. They had been a bear sighting noted in the Sarver hiker log. Hopefully he or she is resting now. No place to run up here.

Turning from rock to good dirt trail we hit a smooth section and quickly reach the sign for the Eastern Continental Divide and turn off the mountain. 2.7 to reach Niday shelter. Trying to quick step the down for a couple miles the knee(s) start talking to me. I’ll need to stop at the shelter for a stretch. No way we’ll make the 12:30 eta to meet Bonnie.  

Looks close at the trail for every step trying to lesson any impact my eye doesn’t catch mr. slitherin. We both raise up when a yell out SNAKE. He was a good foot up off the ground as I before I hit back to ground and began backing up. TJ goes instantly in for a closer look and stick tricks. He was a health specimen and took shelter under the leaves out of our path. 

Heat wells up as we descend closer to the valley. Stopping at the shelter other hikers are having lunch, 12:30. I try to text Bonnie, no signal. Hope she isn’t worrying. Snack and a stretch I send the kids on to reach her before I can. 1.2 miles is a short stint but this downhill has me slow going. 

Hootie Hoot. I hear cars I’m here, I’m coming. First shift is over. The kids are in the coolers and eating PBJ’s. Come to find I was only 10 minutes behind them 1ish now. Let’s get charged up for round two.

Shoes off, food in and lots and lots of Gatorade and water. Bonnie’s brought in reinforcements, ice cold. Anna reloads all my liquids and makes sure I have plenty to get me through this next phase. I feel like I’ve come in to a pit stop and the crew has me gassed and ready to pull out. The kids cheer us on as they had for home.

Greasing up my knees with my new medicine it’s time to hike on. Bonnie’s ready too. Has herself a new small day pack and extra Gatorades. 2 ultra-runners are starting off too. They are going 17 miles covering out same path and much more. Come on Bonnie we have to make sure they don’t catch us but on our return. 

7.4 miles this second shift will cover. Just get me to the top of Brushy Mountain Bonnie and if we can’t make it down I have all we need to stay the night or just cover me in duff.

Having fresh legs she is right on my heels. The first miles is an easy rolling trail to the butt of the mountain and then the long switchbacks start and they don’t stop till your reach the top. Thank goodness.

Evening sun heats, no breeze now, uggg I gotta stop for a charge. Bonnie keeps conversation which helps put the burn out of mind. We dipped out bandana in water before we started this climb and then are completely dry only damp with our sweat. 

I think I can I think I can. Slow steady steps don’t stop walking. The trail turns sharper and shorter switchbacks this is it….Bonnie slides back,  a switchback below me know. You go on Martha, I’m coming, Keep your pace. I’ll see you at the bench. 

Oh yes that bench. I just need to get to that bench. It marks the crest of this long haul and a respite with a peach. Yes I have packed up 2 ice cold peaches from the cooler. I had shared a couple of peaches with 2 thru-hikers this morning as we dropped cars. Oh what a treat fresh fruit is. 
Ghost rider Ghost rider, come in ghost rider, do you have visual of the destination? Oh yes the bench. I collapse on it. Guzzling Gatorade I dig our peaches out and don’t wait on Bonnie is bite in. Click click I hear her sticks. “Good Lord, I didn’t think I was gonna make it, But I’m here” , collapse she does too. 

Our peaches were like sweet elixir to our bodies. Wish I had brought 2 more. Bonnie looks down one way and then the other..What’s out there? Pointing to the south. Audie is to our north and our turn around point. Oh that path will take your about 200 yards to a parking spot by the forest gate. WHAT? You can drive up here? I think Bonnie just saw red. Umm yeah, that’s our out if we couldn’t make it down or I can throw up camp right here girl. Well at least I know you’re looking out for us…I think.

Walking the last half mile to view the monument was just a stroll compared to what we just tackled. Felt good to not work so hard. It looks so different too. Lush grassy road bed with a beat down dirt path to follow. We are always up here in colder times and can see out on both sides of this ridge. 

The stairs and stripe fly high on Brushy Mtn. Many flags have been placed around the large granite monument in honor of Audie Murphy. 2 hikers are here, both of which we met at Niday shelter and 1 even from the Glade Mtn hike, City Slicker. I remembered him and he me. He’s hiked the trail 10 times and wishes me well upcoming. Bonnie and I don’t stay long here just enough time for a quick photo and about face for our hike back.

Taking come vitamin I at THE bench it’s time to easy on off of here. Wow we hiked all this Bonnie says. It’s even hot hike downhill. I can’t wait to reach the longer switchbacks. This is beginning to get real uncomfortable. I normally don’t stop going downhill and surprise Bonnie with 2 pull offs. Stretch and liquids.

Pound Pound down down. Hope we make it out by dark Bonnie tests. I calculated 6:00, 5:30 at the earliest. Its 5:00 now Bon. I think we can make it by the early time. 

Reaching forestry sign we know we’ve got it covered. Runners the runners are back. Ha and they didn’t pass us till we almost finished. Seems minor but that’s a big accomplishment for us. Ha they just ran 17 miles in 4 hours the same time it took us to hike 7.4. Yea like I said that’s big!!

Official time for the second shift 5:47pm. Lead dog official hiking time for the day 9 hours.  That’s more than I wanna again for a while. We can’t wait to get a cold beverage and hit the creek bank. Feet in the water with the minners. Now this is how to end the late shift!","Sarver Holler

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598891,"Our adventure starts back in Lynchburg this year with travel connections via car, train, bus to NY, Boston and Maine. The Buckner family opens their home for us to crash in last night so we can be close to the train station early tomorrow morning. Thanks guys for a place to lay our heads.

What’s a trip without our ‘scheduled’ train delay? Arriving early at the Lynchburg train station we hang out on the boarding area. 4:45am Backpacks and carryon bags all piled up like we own the place. Attendant watching us close. Departure time 5:45am??

Uh not quite, an announcement comes over the speaker.. delay for train # us eta 9:45!  Shit here we go again. Last year we had such a delay it destroyed all connections so I immediately head inside to talk to Kimberly.  Working her magic she makes some calls and clicks on her computer and we are all set to ride the fast track out of New York, the Acela.  New tickets in hand all we can do now is wait for this train to roll in.

The Acela train is a costly fast ride, the reason I don’t opt for it but Kimberly has us switched at no extra cost. We are at its mercy to make up lost time to get us to Boston and our bus there leaving at 8:15pm  

Arriving in New York we hit our watering hole, TGI Fridays corner booths.  Tall boy please. Anna keeps close eye on the monitors to determine which track we board from. Acela for Boston you’re up.

Now you’d think traveling fast would make for a bumpy ride but not the case. We didn’t even know how fast we were going till we took a trip to the café car. Let’s grab a bar stool at 125!! Cattle and houses zipped by. Sure hope he don’t slam on the brakes or I’m gonna lose more than my beer. 

We only have 15 minutes between this train’s arrival in Boston to catch our bus in the South Station.  Asking our conductor for directions before the door opens we are set for the sprint. Well I didn’t sprint, more like tried to keep up. Anna was out of the gate like Secretariat. Darting between people and showing us the way.

Asking folks in line I make sure they are going to Portland. And so we are!  All connections met!!  Now to hook up with Caribou John for car shuttle to his home. Of which we missed last year due to train derail. I met John in Shenandoah on a section hike in 2009 I think it was. He helped Captain, Shortcut and me on the 2010 Maine trip and we’ve called on him the last 2 years. We can’t wait to meet Kate, Rusty-his dog and see his house in Yarmouth. 

After a long day of travel, some movie time while on the bus, we are ready for some food and bed. Pizza works.","Lynchburg VA

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598961,"Last night’s sleep was heaven. After a long day of travel it was nice to lay down and just rest. I built in a transition day this year so we didn’t have to “run” from trains to the trail. So we have all day to get transported to Rangeley where we left off last year and get settled in to the hostel there. 

Jim was up before day break to catch the sunrise from the dock not far from John’s home. He was in an out without disturbing Rusty whom I’m sure would have alerted everyone. The smell of coffee has us up and moving along with Kate preparing eggs and toast.  We plan to get on the road by 8 or so since it will be a 4 hour round trip for John’s shuttle. 

Bounce boxes with town items, clothes are left with him to drive over to our other Maine connection, Bonnie in Scarborough.  Just the packs on our backs now as we turn on hiker mode.

Arriving in Rangeley we pull into our hostel which is having a facelift. Fieldstone Cottages is now the hostel used out of The Farmhouse hostel. The owners Stacey and her husband have converted all of the Farmhouse to a bed and breakfast/wedding destination. The cottages are being built for wedding parties and vacationers. The hostel is a house with hiker quarters underneath. Tyvek still flaps with just a note on the door letting us know this is the place. John is a bit hesitant to drop us off, “there got to be a better place in town”.  Not to worry, never judge a book by its cover. We’ve stayed with Stacey before, I’m its fine?  After a walk thru to verify we do have a bunk and bath a thumbs up is given and John is on his way. 

Angela checks in with us. She is the hiker contact for reservations and shuttles.  Bunks are clean, neat and towels are on our beds. Their son gives us run down on showering and a slight electrical issue if you don’t turn off a particular light you’ll kick the breaker and bam, be without.

We plan to be here for a 4 nights using this as our home base and slack packing the next 3 days. Slackin aint cheatin. This is when you carry a day pack or less verses your full pack. No ruffing is just yet. I’ve planned to ease us in a bit and save my knees from a heavier load. 

Not long after arrival we hear that Harry is going to fly in to the local airport and visit a few days. How cool. Hopefully a fly over while we are on the trail and a hike with us will play out. 

And that’s just what was planned. Over dinner at the Red Onion we discuss our hike for tomorrow, a 13.2 mile trek starting from Maine 17 where my knee bumped me out of the woods, to Maine 4. It’s a longer hike than I’d plan for Harry but others say best terrain to walk verses our upcoming days. Then the next day a flyover of Saddleback Mountain is pending weather permitting.  Dang can this trip start out any better. Some have a drone but we have a plane!!","Portland Maine

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599000,"It’s really here…I’m here…I’m back in Maine…I’m back to this road that was the end of my road last July. Knee out and heart sick that day I watched my hiking team walk on as I waited on a shuttle driver to retrieve me for town. Jump forward to today from knee surgery in March, three months of physical therapy and lots of training. All I can do now is just hike and see what happens.

Harry has joined us. TJ and Anna have insured this is the best of the choices for his inclusion. They will be re-walking this with us while Jim takes a zero to ready his hiking gear. He has already walked this as well last season. 

Stepping back on the trail felt adrenaline-charged. Pent up emotions over recovery and now time to let them out.  This first hill gets the heart pumping and the legs warm. It’s like I never left.  

Rocks and roots are some but not like most of Maine. Harry had a hard time believing this was the lesser of evils. I keep looking at my feet and trying to find a place to put each foot he says. Oh so true, Maine.

Up and over Bates Ledges and down to Sabboth Day Pond Lean-to we regroup with kids. I was able to call mom from half way down the ledges while having a view over a large pond. You better eat Harry, you’ll need the fuel for the day. Canned peaches will do. 

Pleasant weather surrounds and we begin our slight ascent to a power line easement. Kids we’ll see you there and have another break. Harry and I wind up the ridge chatting about what the rest of the trail might hold and how we might see him from above tomorrow. 

Snacking at the powerline our first thru-hikers come up on us. Rivers, Candyman and Stumbles (girl).  They are excited to hear that there might be flyover tomorrow as they will be on the Saddleback Range too. Look for the backwards tail fin I say. Like there will be more than one plane zooming around. 

Little Swift Campsite is our next gathering place and boy am I ready for a drink. TJ has already reloaded all our water and is ready to squeeze us with fresh filtered.  Big lunch time now I’m starving. Harry ops for some more peaches I think and new shoes. Having not hiked in some time his feet and legs are getting a real workout. Old trail shoes off and soft town tennis on. He’s ready for anything. Only 4.5 more mile. And you say only!

The campsite was getting fuller by the minute when we left as camp groups are coming in from ME 4.  Stacey will be there waiting on us. We set a target time to meet and Anna is all about making that. Carry on we’ll be along. 

The last couple of miles were a gradual descent to the road. Talking with Harry passed our time and kept us from thinking about any pains we might be having. LOL  Trust me Harry the road is just ahead I can hear the traffic.  Running about 30 minutes behind our younger two we pop out of the woods. We’re here, we’re here.

some map review and logistic planning Jim comes up with a better way to ride
out the Saddleback Range. Hike it south, which puts us hiking to town and
getting the 45 minute drive to a side trail (Barnjam Rd) over first thing in
the morning. We are slack packing again today and breaking up a hard section
with this side trail being our access in to the AT. Now this will add 1.4 miles
to our trip making todays tally 16.2 miles. I’m hoping less weight on my back
will help pull this off. I didn’t hike this last year but everyone else did so
they are repeating miles so I don’t have to hike alone today and tomorrow
matter of fact. They tell me it’s a wonderful section worth the work for the
view. So let’s see.
Stacey
pulls up this morning in the jeep which is topless. The jeep, the jeep. It’s a
cool morning with a slight chance of showers. Please hold off, Harry plans to
flyover later and we can’t have storms. Besides we’ll be above tree line over
like 4 miles. My mind can only imagine.
Hardtop
turns to gravel roads and we’re back in the sticks. Only a few houses here and
there and boy do they have a long way to civilization. Luckily these roads
don’t snake around the mountain like we have at home. All valley routes as no
road can be accessed up high in the mountain, snow comes you’re just stuck.  
Look
for the pink Christmas tree hanging up to find your junction with the AT Stacey
instructs. I picture a small pine tree painted pink setting up in a tree.
Follow this old grown up road bed for a mile and a half. It will fork but
follow the prominent path. Jim and the Kids sorta remember this path coming
into the AT while hiking last year. Let’s hope it’s as easy as it sounds.
A
humid day already and some clouds still remain as the sun tries to burn
through. Grass rubs our legs as the road bed thickens with growth. Wild
strawberries grow under foot. Yumm. Did ya’ll see that? A dog, a wolf, a
coyote? It just jumped from one side of the path to the other and was gone. Big
neck thick hair. A pet would have stopped to see us and possibly come. This guy
was wild and spooked.  
I
see it I see it the tree. A pink rope with a twisted formation like a tree
hangs right at the AT intersection. White blazes spotted. 
Jim
leads our way as we head south and down to our first ford of this trip. I
always dread these. Rock hopping can be tricky. One slip and your wet or worse.
Rain sprinkles, no no Damn not this early I say.
Orbeton
Stream turns out harmless and we now have Poplar Ridge to climb and then we’ll
be heading for the Saddles. I’m very excited. Big tests now on the legs and my
training. See yall at the top I’ll be along.

begins to peek out more, closing in on Poplar Ridge Lean To I hear a plane.
Harry is that you? Tree cover is too thick to determine. 
 We
have Saddleback Jr to climb next having already come up 1500 feet. Cap out on
the main summit of Saddleback will be 4000. We all have a first lunch and
refresh our water.
Saddleback
Jr did not disappoint. Cresting out just at treeline it opens to 360 views.
From here I can see exactly what I have ahead. Two wonderfully beautiful
mountains and looks like I have some rough ‘riding’ between them to get there.
Oh it’s not bad my team lets me know. 
See
ya’ll on The Horn.
Between
the swags of the mountains are climbs down 500 feet to ups of 1000 feet but hey
that’s Maine and ya know what, it ain’t near as bad as full on southern Maine.
I can use my sticks and not have to use my hands for climbing. So slow and
steady I take these rock craggy steps and do my best to stay moving smooth and
upright.
 Rounding
a bend in the trail 2 ladies coming north dressing in bright pink. Hey ladies! 
They
stop to talk. What's your name one asks me? Lead Dog, Martha I say. Ha I know
you, been following your blog for years, Say how’s the knee? Laughter fills the
forest. We are the Rag Tag Sisters and we are heading for Katahdin. Ha my group
too. Maybe our paths will cross again.
 Cresting
the Horn I’m feeling Maine.  A
bit tucked and need some food.  Shoot
I’ve been so hot and pushing to keep up with my group I’ve been too tired to
eat much. Living off gummy bears and Gatorade gel bits.
 Wonder
where Harry is? It's 1:00 now.  Just
get me to Saddleback Mountain and we’ll scan the skies for him. Then a text
comes in. He plans to catch us when we stop for second lunch. Perfect!!!  
 Climbing
out of the last swag The saddle opens up. I can see my 3 at the summit sign. 
Other
hikers are here too. Rip Van Winkle, Charmed and Radio (father and daughter duo
finishing her last section of the trail. 
She
is 17). Sucking down water and chomping on my gummies I hear it...we are about
to get buzzed.  Zoooom!!
Harry zips low to make his entrance. 
That
new paint job glistens in the sun light. Vroom he come back again. 
Here
Charmed video us and him.  Cameras
roll and arms wave to show we see you, we see you! 
And
we thought we had a view!  Harry
is in the cat bird seat giving us a trill of a life time. 
With
a final flash of his runway lights and a tip of the wings he flies off in the
clouds goodbye.  
 Nothing
left to do now but hike off here over these last 5 miles. 
You
guys hold that shuttle I'll be along.  
 The
decent off was slow and rocky but again easier than what I expected. 
We
all stop for a break at a fire and close to Eddy Pond. 
Lunch,
I finally feel like I can eat.  Fixing
my food I faintly hear Jim say Moose, Moose, hey guys Moose. 
Finally
registering I grab my phone as she is stomping up the road towards us. 
TJ
gets Anna's phone and retreats back up the trail. 
His
nightmare encounter with our distraught moose 2 years ago has him avoiding such
now.  She
stops for a pose and turns in the woods back towards her pond.  
 Since
we have a shuttle time to meet the kids move on out to meet it. 
Jim
hangs back to walk me out. The last few miles are graded pretty well so the
down isn't bad.  Just
long miles on creaky knees. It was might fine reaching ME 4. 
 Angela
has the Suburban waiting and the kids loaded. Come on Big Dawg get in. 
We
tell her about out animal sighting and she confirms it was a coyote. Glad we
were in group Jim says  or
it would have been a bit scary.

the swags of the mountains are climbs down 500 feet to ups of 1000 feet but hey
that’s Maine and ya know what, it ain’t near as bad as full on southern Maine.
I can use my sticks and not have to use my hands for climbing. So slow and
steady I take these rock craggy steps and do my best to stay moving smooth and
upright.
 Rounding
a bend in the trail 2 ladies coming north dressing in bright pink. Hey ladies! 
They
stop to talk. What's your name one asks me? Lead Dog, Martha I say. Ha I know
you, been following your blog for years, Say how’s the knee? Laughter fills the
forest. We are the Rag Tag Sisters and we are heading for Katahdin. Ha my group
too. Maybe our paths will cross again.
 Cresting
the Horn I’m feeling Maine.  A
bit tucked and need some food.  Shoot
I’ve been so hot and pushing to keep up with my group I’ve been too tired to
eat much. Living off gummy bears and Gatorade gel bits.
 Wonder
where Harry is? It's 1:00 now.  Just
get me to Saddleback Mountain and we’ll scan the skies for him. Then a text
comes in. He plans to catch us when we stop for second lunch. Perfect!!!  
 Climbing
out of the last swag The saddle opens up. I can see my 3 at the summit sign. 
Other
hikers are here too. Rip Van Winkle, Charmed and Radio (father and daughter duo
finishing her last section of the trail. 
She
is 17). Sucking down water and chomping on my gummies I hear it...we are about
to get buzzed.  Zoooom!!
Harry zips low to make his entrance. 
That
new paint job glistens in the sun light. Vroom he come back again. 
Here
Charmed video us and him.  Cameras
roll and arms wave to show we see you, we see you! 
And
we thought we had a view!  Harry
is in the cat bird seat giving us a trill of a life time. 
With
a final flash of his runway lights and a tip of the wings he flies off in the
clouds goodbye.  
 Nothing
left to do now but hike off here over these last 5 miles. 
You
guys hold that shuttle I'll be along.  
 The
decent off was slow and rocky but again easier than what I expected. 
We
all stop for a break at a fire and close to Eddy Pond. 
Lunch,
I finally feel like I can eat.  Fixing
my food I faintly hear Jim say Moose, Moose, hey guys Moose. 
Finally
registering I grab my phone as she is stomping up the road towards us. 
TJ
gets Anna's phone and retreats back up the trail. 
His
nightmare encounter with our distraught moose 2 years ago has him avoiding such
now.  She
stops for a pose and turns in the woods back towards her pond.  
Since
we have a shuttle time to meet the kids move on out to meet it. 
Jim
hangs back to walk me out. The last few miles are graded pretty well so the
down isn't bad.  Just
long miles on creaky knees. It was might fine reaching ME 4. 
Angela
has the Suburban waiting and the kids loaded. Come on Big Dawg get in. 
We
tell her about out animal sighting and she confirms it was a coyote. Glad we
were in group Jim says  or
it would have been a bit scary.   
Say
lets hit the IGA on the way in. We need to celebrate big miles. 
Big
Dawgs gonna close Sarge's down.","Barnjam Road
",Barnjam Rd South to ME 4,"Jul 10, Tue",16.20
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599190,"Well
I didn't close down Sarge's but did charge up on chowder, hot wings and things. 
We
gathered some last minute supplies and prepared for check out today as we
changed up the plan to slack for hiking out. 
Only
2 days hike between Barnjam and the next town of Stratton. 
We'll
save on bunking and another shuttle.
But
first we've got to do some laundry. We made plans for breakfast in town and
laundry.  Only
to find out laundry doesn't open till later than expected and closest diner is
all the way cross town.  Any
hungry hiker will walk for a good breakfast and that's just what Jim and I did. 
A
good mile seems like later we've now gotta double back to get some suds. 
Hey
you guys going this way?  Luckily
a couple stopping in for coffee on the go is traveling thru and gives us a
lift.  #hitchhiking
Laundry
going and time to wrap up packing to head out. 
We
box up extra town supplies for bouncing up to Stratton. 
Angela
says she has runs to Stratton all the time and will get our stuff there by the
time we arrive 2 days from now.  Tell
Trout not to drink my beer.  Trout
worked for The Farmhouse last year and was a big help to me when I came off the
trail lame.  Now
he is working for the Stratton Motel also owned by Stacey.
Harry
is packing up to leave out too.  He
will fly on to visit other friends. 
Shuttle
departure for us 11:00.  Time
to get down to it.
Big
hugs and thank you's to Stacey as she drops us again at Barnjam Road. 
The
heat of the day brings us back up to our trail junction and now time to hike on
north.  A
hiker is relaxing alongside of our path and we sorta startle him. We have
appeared out of nowhere ya know!
Profile
shows a mean up right out of the gate but turns out to be more like home. Hey I
can get used to this.  Cresting
out at Lone Peak it felt good to be on top. 
Lone
wolfing so to speak. Bringing up the rear gives me time to myself and the
trail.  We
are to regroup at the trail intersection which turns out to be a nice open
ridge like walk with much greenery along the trail. Ferns and shorter type
trees. 
Spaulding
shelter brought a food break and then a steep looking climb to Spaulding Mountain. 
Again
turned out to be very forgiving for Maine. 
However
still not moving as fast as my team I reach to top and no one is here. 
Hootie
hoot Hum. We didn't actually say we'd stop but I just assumed. And there's this
side trail some 100 yards to a view. 
Surely
not.  I
ponder.  Go
on? Side trail? Surely not.  I
try and text TJ, nothing, then Jim, nothing. 
Thinking
Even if they did go up side trail they will still catch me if I go on over the
mountain and so I continue north.
Down
down I proceed.  Hoping
all along they didn't go up and then come down expecting me to have just
arrived.  Oh
well hike on.  Jim's
voice carries back to me. Lead dog we are here. TJ got my message and they are
waiting and laughing.  
Ok
dawg all you have left is the hard ass rocks down to the Carrabassett River. 
Oh
boy and a ford.  All
my favorite.
Reaching
to last of the good trail Jim takes my lead and guides me down this rock maze. 
Anna
and TJ are long gone and scoping out camping for us all either at the river or
along the mountain road.  Evening
sun beats down on us making this a steamy side of the gorge. 
We
can see the river cutting through the valley but not close enough to hear its
roar. 
Picking
the best course is a time consuming and Jim does his best to keep me from harms
way.  Hey
PT guys watch this as I step down, way down, racking my knees and then holding
support.  Feel
that!  
Once
out of the hard stuff it's just more down down. 
Finally
the river tells us we are close. 
Jim
says there was a small foot bridge to help with crossing after rock hopping. 
Uggg
I dread it.  Hope
there is no swimming involved.  Big
dawg don't swim.
Yeah
yeah we see the kids waiting on the other side. It's good crossing they say. Uh
those are big rocks and this is a big river. 
It's
down a lot and boy am I glad.  Jim
leads our way rock to rock and we come to the middle where the rocks stop. 
Water
rushes between the long gap to the next rock area. 
A
two foot wide plank is cabled on the rock we stand on and to our destination
some too feet away.  What? 
It's
ok Martha come on across. Jim goes and turns mid plank see it's ok! 
Oh
man. I take a deep breath. No time for Lead Dog Live, this is too live to
document.  My
first couple of step are soft and short. 
Oh
quick quick eyes wide get me to the other side. Whew!
Camping
is either here in a dark area by the river where one hiker is already turned in
or we can go on up to the road for more light. 
At
this point I'm spent and ready to crash any place. 
Cowboy
camping it is.  Or
at least that's SlimJim's plan.  2
Tents go up and darkness sets in. 
Dinner
is a thawed frozen jimmy dean breakfast croissant with sausage egg and cheese.
Wrapped in aluminum foil I give it a heat in the pot. Steam it warm. Add
ketchup, bam!  
Time
for bed. Good night all. Our first night back out on the woods and boy am I
gonna sleep good.","Barnjam Road
",Caribou Valley Road,"Jul 11, Wed",10.50
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599216,"Pitch. That’s what dark is in the Maine woods. Thick heavy trees and in my tent, eye wide open with the sound of some sort of night bird, all I see it pitch black. Too tired to care I turn back over. Shit it gets light at 4:30am and full on day by 5:30 so there’s not much sleeping in. It’s town day so let’s get it.

Nature has me up first and ready to go. Eating my other breakfast croissant I decide this needs to be a trail food staple. Jim says I turned a lot last night like a rotisserie chicken. Sorry if I kept anyone awake. Anna says she and TJ had some turns too.  We are hiking by 6:30am with plans to make town by noon. The Stratton Motel says there is service from the road just call for a quick shuttle pickup.

Crappy Crocker, that’s all I’ve heard of this mountain with two peak, South and North, with a long 5 mile down to the road, ME 27.  The team hiked this last year and this part was the end of a very hot 17 mile day. They were spent after this range was complete. I can’t image tying in what we did yesterday with this. 

A heavy morning, humid and seemingly like threatening rain our climb begins. More rocks to contend stepping over and around with roots to muddle up the trail. We get water since we didn’t last night and this should get us most of the way through. I’ve been trying to drink more to stay hydrated as I seem to heat up more than the others which sometime make me feel sick. So far so good this trip in that category. 

A hiker comes up on us, it’s the guy who hammocked at the river.  His name is Tom and he is from NC and been out hiking for a couple of weeks. He was hoping to be farther along wanting this trip to be his finish at Katahdin. My group carries on while I walk more at Tom’s pace up and up. He says southern Maine was tougher that he thought it would be having the same opinion as us….oh I’ll get the Whites over and I’ll be all set. NOT..Southern Maine will kick your ass. And so we continue….

Storms still staying away we crest the first peak, dang this is not joke, but hey I’ll take rock type steps any day over rock climbing using my hands. Down the swag of South Peak we head on to North Peak. I can hear everyone. They all trekked on past me over South but we are knocking out this big climb all by 9am. Perfect. 

Anna sets her timer, 3 hours and we’ll be at the road she declares. Uh I’ll do my best girl. And they are off.  Jim gave me his water filter for in case I need on the way out. I plan to carry very little to keep my pack light and I’m sure I’ll need a charge with Gatorade mix to help me along. 5 miles of down and sore knees don’t jive.  

Crocker didn’t lie with its profile, long down with some rock stepping and steep toe banging. Working up a sweat I do stop for water with about 2 miles left. No way I’ll make 12:00 but I’m moving at a rate that keeps me from blowing out. It not a race it’s my pace.  

Closing in Jim has come back up the trail looking for me and bringing some water in hand for in case. Thanks man. I’m ok just slow. He says I just missed the shuttle 12:20 now and we’ll just hitch. 

Tired but moving we begin our walk down the road side thumbing. Took some work but we finally got a kid coming off the slopes to pick us up. He works at the sky resort area. His car smells of a hookah lounge, it’s legal up here ya know. If ya gottem burn’em.  

Arriving at the motel Trout meets us and the kids have already gotten our room. This is great. We have our own room and frig. Say Trout you didn’t drink my beer did ya? Store run already they have sodas and snacks. Let’s eat! 

Showers and laundry, oh make some beds for discounts off your bill, yes we’ll do that for Treehugger. He helps run the place here for Stacey. Tom is a door down the way too. Here have a cold one man and lets enjoy this porch.

Burger challenge oh we have to see what this is all about. The White Wolf Inn calls us over across the parking lot. The Wolf Burger is a ½ lb hamburger, stacked with bacon, sausage, mushroom, onions  and any additions you like served along with steak fries. TJ was up for the challenge and killed it. As his new shirt reads “I conquered the Wolf Burger”.  Burgers and beers around we filled up.  

Resupply boxes opened and packs get ready for another short stretch between towns. Stratton and Caratunk. Now short is relative. I have only like 16 miles do to but the others have that and 20 more. See when I jumped off last year Bones and I did two short days out on flatter trail when we bummed up to Caratunk. These miles are pretty easy walking and this bunch is ready to do a marathon day to make it up. 

Planning session goes into effect once again. Martha if you’ll do 10.4 tomorrow to set us up for 26 the next while you walk your 6.3 we’ll see you at Caratunk and cross that river before dark. I can walk 2 more miles to your 26 any old time!  

The Kennebec is a wide river the trail crosses. No wading necessary or should be tried. The ATC has a schedule canoe ferryman that takes hikers across between the hours of 11:00 and 2:00. Tom says a local lady by the name of Cheryl will take hikers across too. Jim gives her a call to line up tentative arrival time of 4:00pm Saturday.  She says just yell across and she’ll come right over…hum that seems sketchy. 

I line up my shuttle from E. Flagstaff Road for Saturday at11:00am with Paul at Caratunk House. I’ve already made our plans to zero at this place on Sunday. Hot tub time and wings at Northern Outdoors awaits us. 

Bedtime approaches. Bust a few blisters and get the feet ready for some more climbing tomorrow. Bigelows Baby.","Caribou Valley Road
",ME 27 Stratton,"Jul 12, Thu",8.30
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599468,"With having “only” 10
miles today my, crew is in no big hurry to rush out the door. I don’t press
either makes time for a little extra shut eye and time to walk down to a local
diner for a good breakfast. Jim is out much earlier than I’m ready and directs
me to where he ate and service, Mary Jane’s Diner in the back of the Citgo. I
ordered their blueberry pancakes with sausage and extra syrup. They were
amazing and too big even for this Big Dawg to finish so I packed them out for
TJ.
Trout has already
taken Tom and some other hikers on up to the trail on the early shuttle run. We
get checked out and wait our turn. A few other hikers will be able to ride with
us too so the shuttle is gonna be full. Having still some town items and leftover
food we don’t want to just give out we ask Trout to bounce yet another box up
to Millinocket for us. Hey you might see me in Caratunk I have shuttles there
too he says.  Give me a shout when you hit Katahdin
and when you see Bones.  He fancied her I do believe. :o)
All new territory now
for our team. For the first time of this trip we all set our shoes on
unchartered ground together. There are several high peaks today with 8 of the
10.4 miles being climbing. That will bod well on the knees but will test my
cardio.
It’s a cat ass day!
That’s Maine slang for fantastic. Right Caribou John? Pristine skies, Maine
like temps so we aren’t melting in humidity yet and this trail…am I still in
Maine?  The climb was graded fairly with plenty
of rock but I’ll call them good rocks. Step here and step there for stair
master like workout. I got that. This turned to plush pine trail underfoot in
places with giant rock to work around and up and over. 
Say I know you, a
lady comes hiking my way looking very familiar. 
Sure enough we met
last year.  Her name is Maps. Oh I love maps too I
say and we both recall her into to Guthooks, a trail guide app you can use on
your phone.  I am now using it some for the first
time today too It is grand.  GPS runs in airplane mode so you don't
rundown battery.  Spot on indications of where you are in
relation to where you wanna go. We chat about our sections and what's next. 
Good luck. 
Turning some steep
now I can feel the sweat rolling down my back. We must be getting close to the
The Horn. Wew I’m ready to eat.
Made it and what a
view and this isn’t even from the good stuff. Banana and gummies, it’s what’s
for second breakfast.  Jim points out a sky slope affair.
That's Stratton.  Then I look north and oh what peaks
await.  
First up Horns Pond.
Wow I could stay here all day.  If you watch the show Northwoods Law
you may have seen this area featured. 
Forestry Service
helps maintain this pond by stocking with fresh trout they haul in on the backs
in cases.  Way cool. 
I'd like that job
IF I didn't have this past climb to make. 
There's a day use
shelter and an AT shelter and plenty of tenting here. 
Crystal waters in
this pond better for swimming I'd say. 
A short mountain
ridge surrounds it like added protection giving that since of privacy. 
Prime place but we
have miles to make so we take in this high mountain beauty while we can.  
Second up South Horn.
Now this had a bit of a climb. Straight up but short, opening up to more clear
views of West Peak and Avery Peak. 
What a sight,
couldn't ask for better weather either. 
Now when I say best
of the best it kinda starts here. 
I know I've seen
some good stuff up to this point but oh this sections is fine. 
Trail turns to
soothing rich greenery, moss lined path. 
Leading my way
between aged trees I feel lost in time. 
Videos or
description doesn't do it justice. 
This goes on for over
a mile and then the ascent to West Peak begins. 
These climb a again
are short a sweet.  Hard leg burns but worth every step. 
Cresting above tree
line with more spectacular views. Ponds dot this vast land not a roof to be
seen anywhere. 
West Peak affords a
close up view of Avery Peak each capping out at over 4000 feet. Dropping off
via rock slab trail we trek to Bigelow Col and what would have been my original
stopping point having hike 8 miles. 
Remember out game
plan was changed up and 2.4 more miles left today.  
2:30pm Avery campsite area was nice enough
but water was slight and lots of people already hovering in so our change up is
looking even better.  However I'm pretty tired and needing a
bit more of a rest.  This tent platform is perfect for a
stretch out and lunch.  
Anna checks the time
table a says we are a head of schedule and we can be in camp by 4:30
and I'd better be in camp by 6:00.
Haha. See ya on Avery Martha. 
Chugging along its my
last climb of the day and well worth the work. 
Completely exposed
Avery stands massive tall and I'm right on the edge of him. 
Trail skirts from
one side to the other with a turn I almost miss. 
Bluest of blue
skies I walk up into...heaven?  Puffy clouds hang up high casting
shadows on E. Flagstaff Lake.  It stretches for miles. 
From the peak sign
I look over to find my group setting in what appears to be a square rock bunker
aka a mountain hot tub.  Jim lays back arms hanging out like he
is resting on the pool side.  I must hurry so I can cannonball.
Having some laughs
and soaking up views I declare This Is the best of the best. 
Now let's head for
that camping area. 
We've been told
several are heading this way and tenting may become sparse so the kids get on
their horses and take off.  Jimbo is hanging with me, we have a lot
of down and we don't know how much will be rocks.  
Turns out often the
first mile we get back in the woods for more calming trail. 
When a group of
scouts is heard we decide best if Jim takes off too and secure tenting for us. 
We can share the
same tent pad area.  Steady I go taking care of knees and
footing. No time to get careless but I hear them fast approaching. 
View! 
Ah yes that will
stop them rascals from catching me. 
Checking my
Guthooks says Safford Notch sites in .2. I am here. 
TJ has selected a
good spot them and Anna has 'reserved' us a place below them. Lots of tents
already up. Water retrieved lets eat. We all have big days tomorrow...mine
not so much in miles...but big day in that I will connect another section of
trail checking it off this list and best of all....it a town day....look out
Caratunk population 33, here I come. 
Big day in miles
for my team.  They are getting up at 4:00am
for a marathon to the Kennebec...26.2 miles to be exact.  
Turned in I leave my
rain fly penned open.  Warm night. Jim cowboy camps just at my
head.  Feels good to lay down and just look up
thru the roof.  Thinking over what all I saw today
makes me smile.  Peaceful night...sleep....","ME 27 Stratton
",Safford Notch Campsite,"Jul 13, Fri",10.40
Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599500,"Jim’s headlamp clicks on, 4:00am. Time to get those marathon legs on boys and girls. I can hear Anna and TJ packing their gear too way above me. Jim drops my food bag at my door, good luck guys, be safe. They are off to hike 26.2 miles to the Kennebec River and then “call” Cheryl for a canoe across.  I on the other hand have another hour before I plan to get up so I turn over to get more shut eye. 


Sleeping right up to 5:15 I awake very refreshed. Quietly I pack up, eat part of my breakfast, I’m alittle antsy.  I recalled the slight markings on the side trail into here and not liking how it seemed random and really want to get going back to the AT. I have only 6.3 miles to my road, E Flagstaff, where shuttle pick up is scheduled for 11am. I want to be walking on the AT by 6:00 for early arrival. Not knowing if Little Bigelow holds hard ups or downs I am allowing more than enough time for problems. Anna gave me to 10:00 to get there starting at 6:00 so I will do my best to keep her time. 

Carrying not only Guthooks on my phone I also have Jim’s Delorme tracking site so I can see where they are on their trek.  I plan to meet them by the river this eve and can video them coming across. I’ll not worry much with tracking them till I get in.

6:00am sharp and I’m following the blazes north. It’s a grey day and chance of rain apprears prominent. I sure hope not. Not so much for me but for my team. That would slow them down greatly even when the trail turns flatter I remember a lot of the pond areas of West Carry and Pierce being black mud and rooty. 
There some of that here with me. Bog planks to cross and heavy ground to pick though. The 1000 gain up to Little Bigelow was lots of ups and then right back downs. My legs aren’t feeling quite as strong and I feel myself getting a little shaky on the descents so I slow down and take a deep breathe. You have time girl, don’t rush, easy. 

Stepping over a boggy section I see a foot place to hit and do but…wooo I’m sliding…balance lost, right foot going, going, gone. Sticks sinking too. Shit, I twist and just set back on the bank in thick moose maple. Now to get back up without falling backwards in the black muck. I get my left foot on solid ground and climb farther up on the bank on all fours. Steady. Steady I begin standing up and pulling my sunken foot out of the goo.  No need to investigate. It’s wet, just walk it dry. 

Finally cresting Little Bigelow a sign tells me I’m at the top. Good. But no views, shoot. I could see some between the tree cover but nothing like yesterday. Oh well it can’t go on forever. 

Meeting a few SOBOs now who have come from the shelter a few miles my north. Good I’m making pretty good time. I meet Charmed and Radio again here too. They are slacking this section and he tells me to not miss the blueberries on the next descent. 

Glad to stop and eat a few berries along this long down was timely. Not steep but quite sloped on rock slab trail. So thankful it’s not wet or this would be troublesome. Views of Flagstaff are closer which means my destination is closing in. 

Easy graded trail, time to stretch it out Lead dog. I smell the smoke from the shelter. I need water but plenty is flowing all along the trail and I’m sure it will right down to the road so I trek on and will reload so to have extra when I finish. It’s 9:00 and I’m betting I’ll be at the road in 30 more minutes. 

What’s this a butterfly? A gal comes out from the shelter turn off booking it north. She looked to be packed heavy for a NOBO but hey who knows. She had large butterfly winds on her back so I told her I liked them as she disappeared around the next turn. 20 minutes later here she comes towards me. Crying..oh what’s wrong butterfly, oh I’ve taking a wrong turn. She was in fact a south bounder. Oh so sorry. The day is young it will get better don’t cry. 

Flat flat the trail turns, time for water fill up and a chat with the Yorkshire boys. Dad and son hiking south as far as they can go they say. Good luck to Katahdin they wish and move on.

Reaching the road I’m tickled to death be back here. Bones and I hiked to here from Caratunk over 2 days when I could stand staying put. So here is another piece connected. Now time to celebrate a bit.  

Waiting in the parking area off this dirt road I have my first lunch and chug my cold water with Gatorade.  Some other gals come in for day hiking. Right it’s Saturday. One is from Virginia and others have met before in school. They are very interested in my hike and the trail and we share stories. Magic.. oh it’s here, I am offered a banana. Trail magic nice. Then a barefoot hiker comes in. He is hiking north for a while and then bumping off for another trail. I couldn’t believe he’d already hiked through The Whites and to here barefoot. Crazy callouses. 

A van pulls in and a lady rolls down the window, any one here named Martha? Yea baby that’s me. So long gals it’s time for town.  Bonnie is a new worker for Paul. A free spirited lady at retirement age, a love for the arts and nature. We enjoy our ride and stop at Jimmy’s for some groceries. It’s the only place within many miles to Caratunk so I didn’t want to miss it on the way in. Long Trail Ale and a bottle of vino please, we have Bastille Day to celebrate when my bunch hits that river. 

Arriving at the house Paul has the places smelling of his smoked pork. Yumm..but first I’ll have a strawberry shake please. Paul runs a great little B&B, catering to hikers and all. Shakes, pulled pork samiches every day most of the day are sold to any that ask. Shower a couple bucks or stay and really enjoy this quant house of history. 

Shower, resting and enjoying some down time to myself I settle into my quarters, visit with other hikers, and have some cold ones naturally. GPS show my team moving along nicely. 

Some hours later I check their progress and it’s looking like they are within shouting distance. Time for me to see if they have come in. It’s just before 4:00 so Cheryl should be close by. I call her number to let her know her services are needed and leave a message. 

Now the B&B is like quarter of a mile from the river and right on the trail. So I walk down across the main road and hit the river to walk parallel to them. I hear Anna’s voice.. CHERYL….waving I see there is a big group over there need portage. No boat. The ATC cut off is 2:00. Cheryl says just yell. SHIT you can’t hear across this. Before I left I asked Paul where she might live so I could just go say hey we need a ferry lift. Direction some sketchy I walk another mile or more to find her home. Not sure at any location since no one answers, I leave a note on a door to a Mike and Kim’s place. They have boats and a bunkhouse for like renters. Maybe they will be back soon and can help. 

Walking back to the river bank my head is down and I hate to bring disappointment to my team and others. No one can be found I yell. I’m sorry, I yell. Jim is telling his side don’t worry ya’ll our Alpha Male is on it she’ll get us across. Uhhh what else can I do? Worse yet texting or calling isn’t an option to communicate, no service!  All I can do is walk back and hope my note is seen or their calls will be heard by the missing Cheryl. 

Paul is fixing pizza and invites me to join them for dinner when I return. He is as frustrated with this situation as I. They have worked so hard to get here, now they will have to camp and maybe in the rain. Uggg I feel awful. Here have some food he say, Bonnie getting me a beer…then out of the corner of my eye I see TJ..what? My team…they are here..holycow they are here. I run outside and give a big hug to all. Then just by coincidence Bones is dropped off at the driveway.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599704,"After
some much needed rest my team is excited to have hiked their marathon day and
rewarded with a full day off with me. 
I
am nursing a blister or two but nothing I haven't had to deal with before. 
Knees
need this day off and I didn't even kill it. 
Some
tired feet is all I was hearing out of them.  
The
house was over booked so Jim and I took bunking in the front room on mattress
in the floor. Others got rooms and we'll get shifted to a room today. 
It's
a rainy morning so lying in wasn't too hard for everyone.
Paul
can get the house up easy.  His
coffee brewing and bacon aroma has it smelling heavenly. 
French
toast, fried potatoes, eggs with tomatoes, bananas, juice, oh man it's good. 
And
think tomorrow we get to do it all over again before we leave out.  
Served
family style we gather around the table and meet other hikers. 
Some
we've already met and some new.  Stumbles
and Candyman whom we met prior to Saddlebacks. 
They
saw Harry's fly over too.  A
mom and daughter team hiking a long section to Katahdin. Then Grumpy, who
really looked like one of Cinderella's elfs but much taller, thru-hiking. 
They
are all heading north so we'll be bumping along with them.
Rain
allows us to hang around the house, browsing wifi and eating more milk shakes,
and watching more hikers come and go.
There's
a little excitement at the river this morning. 
We've
been following a hiker on social media seeking the fastest known time (FKT) on
the AT.  This
record has been set and broken each year by male and female, supported or
unsupported.  His
wife was by yesterday and we talked. She was very supportive of her husbands
attempt and works with a pacer was making sure timing would be right for him to
cross without delay.  Thing
is he is already off pace to win but he is still pressing to finish and make a
good time.  Better
not count on Cheryl I say!   Jim
is all into these runners, ultra marathons, and is quick out the door to see
this crossing happen.  Turns
out our missing canoeist is all about being on site for his swim! 
Yes
he decided to cross on foot.  Water
is lowest in the AM so swimming was a success. Folks in boats handy in case of
incident.  
Rain
continues to pepper down and those thru-hikers looking to head out do just
that. No rain, No Maine.  The
other section hikers not running out the door just yet.  
Closing
in on noon the weather breaks.  BBQ
samiches roll from the kitchen along with shakes. 
After
the dust settles it time for us to make this zero really count. 
He
have a hot tub to hit.  The
Northern Outdoors is calling us. 
Having
been here last year we know exactly what we at in for and it’s all fun!
First
up a round of cold brews please and can you put that tv on the World Cup. Look
who's come in..its Tom our hiker from Crocker Mountain last seen in Stratton. 
Hot
tub time man. Cannonball.  Wallace
joins us too.  He
is a TN boy, southern through and through. 
Tom
says his journey will end in Monson having taken longer to get to this point
than expected.  He
will finish up next year.  Wallace
however is on a mission.  Hiking
big mile days and loving town when he can get it. 
Katahdin
on his radar and plans to hike 7 more miles this eve. 
My
guess is he drank a beer for every mile already hiked today.  
Soaking
and sun my favorite things right now to a cold brew. 
Getting
an assortment of appetizers we start filling our tanks. 
Meat
meat bring the meat.  Hamburgers,
wings and things.  Fortified. 
Time
to call shuttle for pick up. 
With
all this fun I've forgotten the reason for this zero, rest. 
Time
to get these old legs and feet up. 
Supplies
are reviewed for our hike out tomorrow. 
We
pickup at yet another junction we left off from last year, south moxie pond
road.  Only
having to pack for 1 1/2 days I am thankful having scheduled a 16 miler
tomorrow and then a shorter day into Monson.  
It's
hard to believe we have a full week behind after today. Time sure flies when
you're having fun!","Caratunk House

sends us off with another grand breakfast. So long Bonnie you have been a real
pleasure to meet. You keep doing what you do here, you love it. 
Jason
loads us up and transports us to the Moxie Pond area. 
Heavy
fog this morning.  We
can't even see the 'pond'. It's more like a massive lake in my book, stretches
for miles.  
This
is Bones first mile of this trip. 
She
flew in from Austin, Texas to rejoin us. Good timing to come in on a zero day.
She ain't no fool.  Packed
much lighter than her first time we met she settles in the back with me getting
her trail legs under her.  
A
rock hop right out of the gate over a water crossing and some slick rocks with
dew make this tedious.  White
blazes soon lead to a nice easy trail for a couple miles before we start the
climb up Moxie Bald Mountain.   I'm
pretty slow and stiff at the moment. 
Jim
and the kids stop every so often for us to regroup.  
Starting
up Moxie I put Bones on in front so she can keep her momentum. 
It's
heating up now the sun has burned off the fog. I'm a hot mess. 
Come
on Big Dawg, Anna calls out. 
Rock
curves and steeper climbing but a good climb. I'm not too far behind, I can
still see them way up above me.  Capping
out at 2600 feet we've been climbing for the last 2 miles. But oh what a view. 
Another
bald crest, flat rock slab for much exploring. 
The
trail sorta hard to follow here, look rock cairns, has to be this way. 
The
mother daughter duo is here and another 2 ladies.  
Jim
pops open is can of Moxie he packed out. 
Maine
soda, seltzer like drink.  It's
not very good really but cold and sugar are a good combo. 
Second
breakfast and I'm guzzling my water. 
5
miles down 11 more to go.  
Grand
views on the descent down and its graded, YES. 
More
slab rock with ledges. We are in full sun for quite a while rambling off Moxie
till we hit the bottom land and Moxie Pond Lean-to. 
TJ
has some water waiting on me and I reload. 
First
lunch and some stretching.
Profile
shows 9 miles of flat boy I hope that stand true. 
It
mostly does.  Trail
running beside ponds with beautiful surroundings, this is wonderful. 
An
old dam provides another good rest stop. 
Bones
and I take our shoes off to let the feet breathe, it's hot. 7 more miles
Martha, you got this. 
Anna
and TJ are setting a good pace with Bones and Jim in between me. 
My
strides aren't as long with me keeping my pace within myself. 
My
dad used to always say when coaching me and my brother in sports ""just
play your best, play within yourself"".  
He
voice telling me so now.  
Twists
and turns of the trail I can hear my team but not see them. 
Thick 
low
growing trees wind close to several crossing streams and then the trail opens
wide to the West Branch of the Piscataquis River. 
Now
this could be a nasty dangerous crossing but way low water makes for a sand bar
start and then a wade to the trails other side. 
Oh
my team is always here to help me. 
Stay
there Martha, TJ will come back across to carry your pack, Anna instructs. 
I
ready my gear, shoes off and in pack, phone secure, TJ takes it on. 
Camp
shoes on I steady my sticks and begin. 
""Rocks
are some slick, be careful"" Jim says. 
Everyone
watches me as I proceed with care. 
SAFE!
All across.  3
miles to go.
Evening
sun settles on us now. I'm hoping to be in camp by 6 and pretty sure the bunch
will beat me by a good hour or more. 
Longer
miles make for slower Dawg.  Enjoying
the walk along this river helps to drown out the tired. 
These
puds work on me especially when I know my water is about out. Planned it that
way but still hoping to have a sip up to the end. 
A
hiker comes up on me. How far to the shelter he asks? 
Looking
trail worn and somewhat wooly I'll say I don't stop to chat but rather give
guide info I have a move on.  He
says he will stop for a camp by the river, he doesn't do shelters.  
Pressing
to make my personal time cutoff I hit another damn up. That shelter better be
up here I say. Pass two sobos just stopping for camp I know I'm close. 
Jim's
voice.YES!

I am beat. Getting my mat blown up I feel the world turning. Whoop I'm light
headed better set down.  RIP
says whoa  Lead
Dog, here have some energy water, electrolytes needed. 
Remember
we met him on Saddleback? RipVanWinkle. Come to find out he does wilderness
rescue and is attentive to make sure I am at myself. 
Charmed
and Radio are here too. And my closest bunk buddy is Zoom Zoom. 
She
is a fast hiker they say.  Every
time they get some place she is already there. 
These
folks have traveled many miles together.  
The
shelter will be full, adding me., 7 total.

already has his tarp up and saved me the last spot. 
There
is a chance of rain tonight and more so tomorrow. 
We
all are Monson bound and want to stay dry.
We
all get our supper ready while Charmed goes for long swim. 
Radio
says her dad swims all he can and will be gone a good hour. They will eat
later. Mashed potatoes with A-1 for me and some pepperoni. 
Ok

out on top of my bed I get so relaxed I crack off some 'sounds'. Oh L-train
would be proud of that. Look out Zoom zoom she's dangerous, Anna says.

your head!  Oh
don't you worry girl I will behave!?! The shelter shook with laughter while Jim
retreated for his own shelter saying ""Big Dawgs gonna get kicked out
tonight""","Caratunk House

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599790,"Up early the whole shelter is out to beat the rain. Zoom Zoom is first out and not to be seen the rest of the day. Our group is next packed up with RIP close behind. Charmed and Radio are moving but not quite ready to roll.  See ya’ll in town.

Anna is not going to get wet. She is out front moving fast with TJ on her heels. I’m slow going this morning. Knees very stiff and biting on this initial down. We have 9 miles to town and the blisters on my heels are becoming a problem. I’ve put mole skin on but it is working lose rubbing. Not wanting to take the time to fix since we have a river crossing I’ll just deal with it later. 

Kids on the other side at the crossing they say the rock hopped. Humm…not seeing it. Following Bones she is already dipping her toes in, not good for me then. Shit, I’m not moving fast enough and these smaller rocks are tipping on me. Feet in soaked. Oh well supposed to rain anyway. Ringing out my socks and reaccessing moleskin it’s time to pull out my compression socks used to help with plantar fasciitis. Bones says these will be great to hold moleskin in place verses duct tape. So double socked up I’m off.

Darker and darker the skies get. The kids were going to wait at the next fireroad crossing but with the treat of storms we bet they are long gone. Jim and Bones are hanging back with me noticing I am struggling a bit more today. Jim offers to take my heaviest item in my pack which is my clothes bag stuffed with my knee brace. Not sure if this will speed me up but will surely lighten my already pretty light pack. No food left but a snack. 

Fog thickens around us. A lake to our right but not able to really see the difference in it and the fog, all is white. A noise comes from in front of us…a boat? Sure enough, a small motor boat cuts through the fog, is anyone even driving it, I can see him, a loon calls, eerie as the darkness swallows us. Rumbles above, quick rain jackets on and pack covers….RAIN.

I try to walk faster to not much avail. Trail becomes a creek. Nothing to do but just hike. 6 miles in and we have one last hill to crest, Buck Hill. Rain has poured hard for a mile or so but is tapering now so let’s have snack and break. I’m burning up gotta come out of this jacket anyways. 

Buck Hill crossed, skies lighten but still a ‘soft day’ as Bones calls it. Slick rock forms underfoot. Slab rock, I knew I’d hate this stuff when it get wet. No falling now. We are almost to the road I hear the traffic. Don’t fall over there it’s slick Anna calls out. BAM! Jim goes down. I tippy toe. No falling! Bone slides safe to the guardrail. 

We didn’t wait it was starting to rain Anna says. I don’t blame you I’d run too if I could. 10:30 was the best I could do. Let’s call Shaws for a ride.

A big suburban rolls up. Only those with reservations to load first, that’s us, Gandolf jumps in, hey what ya doing boy? RIP comes in just in time to ride too. The house is full but Lakeshore is taking reservations and we can take camping in the yard the little gal explains. 

Pulling up the large white home I remember being here in 2010 when under Dawn’s management. Now Poet and Hippy Chic own the place.  Martha your group will be in the bunkhouse. There is one pullout couch to a bed will that work? Sure Anna and TJ can use this, say can you work in RIP for a place he needs room? Hippy Chic says sure and by the way I’ll reduce ya’lls rate since you are accomodating the couch. Here have a PBR!   What? Hell yeah. I tall boy on a Tuesday can’t beat that and it’s free with your stay. 

We get settled to our bunks, shower, and then head for the local bar at the Lakeshore House. Been here too. Great food and atmosphere. Wish it was sunny out or we’d set on that dock overlooking the lake. Appetizers, taco Tuesdays and beer. Bones treats us with a local dish, smoked salmon and such on breads and crackers. Very good. The place is packed and with all our hiking friends met. Mom and daughter, Charmed and radio, RIP joins at our table. Thanks Lead Dog for getting me at Shaws, cheers.

Feeling me legs swell by the minute I have just one more beer and then we’d better head back for some rest. Besides we all do have to hike out tomorrow and there are some details in need of working out. Let’s hit the local market on the way back and grab some planning refreshments!

Maps spread out, my spreadsheet for reference Jim, Anna, TJ and Bones hash out what’s best over the next 3 days for hiking miles I have already hiked back in 2010. The start of the 100 mile wilderness begins tomorrow outside of Monson and runs to Abol Bridge. I’ve walked 30 of these from where we left off this morning. Me I will jump ahead to KI road and move on with shorter hikes, alone.  Yes Alone mom. Sorry but that’s the best solution for the group. 

Bones doesn’t want to leave miles undone in the wilderness having selected this part of her trip as the main reason for coming. Now however she is faced with a big challenge of miles per day and she has a bit of a sore knee developing too. Anna and TJ run as a team and are more than up to the marathon days Jim has draft out. Anna checks the maps and confers and average of 20 miles a day and we will meet up at Jo Mary Road. It’s 59 miles from here to there. Boy am I glad I only have 28 to hike. 

Beers around the plan is set. Food packed up and ready for a food drop to Jo Mary. Yes Shaw’s will deliver supplies to you in the wilderness. Everyone here is just about getting a drop at this location some time or another 3 days from now. 

After visiting with some of our bunk mates it’s closing in on dinner time so why not head back to the Lakeshore, belly up to the bar and celebrate heading out to the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow. I can’t hardly believe it’s finally here. The push to Katahdin.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean To

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599888,"Anxious doesn’t capture the feelings today. This will be the first time my team is truly apart on the trail. I know what’s in front of them and it’s a lot of hard miles and long days. For me it’s the unknown and alone. Now I’ve hiked many times by myself but only for a day or two and a night out. Time to really feel it. 

Shaw’s provided us with a huge breakfast. Tables packed with people and food. Eggs how you like them, bacon, fried tators, toast, pancakes. I’m stuffed. Now to get our food drop time finalized. I’ve set my meeting time for 4:00 Friday at Jo Mary Road. My team should be in hopefully by that time too. We can re-unite with food and a PBR. Yes Shaw’s gives you another brew at the drop zone. YES!

Shuttles are leaving on the hour and half hour this morning. Some already gone immediately after breakfast. My teams waits there turn. I’m anxious for them to get started too as they have 20+ miles to walk today and seems everyone going north plans to hit the same shelter, Cloud Pond. Me, I have only 8 miles today. All up but short. 

Killing time waiting our turn we weigh in our packs. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, I’m at 19 pounds. Jim at 21, Anna 23 and TJ at 27. He’s carrying food for two. I didn’t get Bones weigh in but guessing she’s in the low 20s too. We are NOBO pack ready. 

All our hiking friends met are heading out for the wilderness along with us. They are skeptical of my marathon team making the miles to Jo Mary Road. Oh they don’t know how dedicated they are to this challenge. As Jim says, “We Will be There!” I wave good-bye as the van drives them away.

10:00am I am dropped at KI Road by Dawn.  She and her husband used to own Shaws. How ironic she is my shuttle driver this morning giving me to opportunity to reminisce with her about my 2010 trip to this very place. You guys helped us so much then. Captain had to come off the trail at this very road when his knee went out. Shortcut and I turned this unfortunate event into day hiking other miles north and summited Katahdin. Dawn I’m back to get down to some unfinished business.

Along on my ride was a young guy, Corey and his service dog, Gracie. He is a veteran finding his way back into society walking sections of the 100 mile wilderness. We determine our paths will cross again over White Cap Mountain tomorrow, him being dropped off at another location south of me. Dawn directs me down the side path which will connect me back to the AT and where I left of eight years ago.  

Standing on the banks of the West Branch Pleasant River I take caution to secure all in my pack from getting wet. My shoes are tucked in and I’m gonna wade in my camp shoes, the water is not deep, I can see the bottom, or at least now I can. Two other hikers are here as well so that makes me feel better taking my first steps in. Surprisingly it’s not ice cold, rather lukewarm. Rocks are slick so I take my time and reach the other side without any problems. A very old sign reads 83.9 miles to Katahdin making me smile. I know I have fewer miles than that to officially say I’ve walked the Appalachian Trail and plan to calculate that up tonight.

Settling in to a nice pace on this graded up along the Gulf Hagas Brook I am feeling at ease. Being alone allows your senses to be more attune to everything around you. All sounds are intensified, colors more vivid, and the mind runs wild. Hope my team is doing ok heading for the Barren Mountain Range.

Sun tries to reach me in the thick woods but glistens on the brook. Walking with the water makes for a beautiful section and helps you forget you are climbing up. I pass a few hikers coming south from a shelter. They are packed heavy but in good spirits. 

Needing water and food at this point so I plan to stop at Carl Newhall lean-to for a break. This will put me 5.5 miles in and have hiked most of my trip today. Just the way I like it. 

Coming to high area there’s water crossing the trail the shelter must be close. Steps and trail work, for sure this is the area. Hearing some voices I come on up the steps and a side path. Perfect I’m here. I drop my pack here in the sun. It’s windy today and the cool air will have me chilled quick when I stop. There are 3 hikers here, 1 SOBO and 2 other day hikers out for a few days. They all plan to do the Gulf Hagas Loop. I hear it is very nice and you can see the gorge more so than from the AT. The privy is calling me so I don’t chat long. 

Getting water to mix with my Gatorade I decide with this good source to load up for tonight. I had talked with others this morning and they said the campsite I plan to hit has water but just ok. It has to be down a hill since the site us up high, that’s usually the case. 

Standard lunch of tuna in a pita, gummy bears and goldfish are downed. Checking my map I have a good up yet to climb but it is short. About 2 miles to camp. I should be there before 3:00.

Feeling great today the knees are good and strong. Glad for the climbs that helps.  Feeling the heat well up now, climbing with full sun on me and I’m dripping. Blow wind blow. This water is heavy, don’t like carrying 2 liters at all but I’m gonna get to the top of this thing. Gulf Hagas Mountain 2683 ft. Time to contact my honey. 

Service in the wilderness? Who knew? But yes at mountain tops the chances are surprisingly good. I was told to call from White Top if my schedule changed in reaching Jo Mary Rd. Larry is reached and I let him know I probably will not have service tonight down in the cut where the campsites are.

Loving this evening stroll across this slight ridge I can see mountains all around and better the one ahead is West Peak I have to climb in the morning. Bees, birds and butterflies are all about. Landing from leaf to branch. Grass even under my feet some. Oh this is like parts of home. 

Sign Sign, Sidney Tappen Campsites. I recon the area for my best location to tent settling in a wooded area on soft pine needles. Grassy area will lend to wetness in the morning however inviting it is. Two fire rings and one closer to me so I can use for eating and not have food where I sleep. 2:40 I have the place all my own.
  Resting
enjoying this nice spot a SOBO comes in fairly early to stop. She is an Aussie
and packed light for starters. She sets up at the other fire ring which. Asking
where water is I show her the path but say I haven’t been down. She goes and
turns out quite the work to gather and 200 yards steep down.
Finding
this path on the sunnier side of things I decide to have my supper here next to
this big tree and watch the patchy clouds drift overhead. Peaceful and perfect.
Making notes to my journal so I can write these entries this takes me back to
how my trips used to be. Shorter hiking days with time to reflect and relax.
Hummm what goes around comes around.

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599975,"Up and at’em early this morning. Slept great last night. Was lying down in my bunk by 5:30 just resting and writing. Another hiker came in about 7pm.  He tented closer to me and was very quiet. We had breakfast together and talked about our different backgrounds.  French Canadian he is section hiking south coming off in a few days at a wilderness road. Funny we say how this wilderness has so many access roads it really isn’t all that wilderness now. 

Hiking by 6:00am it’s a day of elevation over West Peak, Hay Mountain and White Cap to start. Then 5 miles of down to my destination by the East Branch Pleasant River. Still thinking these climbs will be hard and treacherous I have my mind set on chugging up nasty rocks and going down hard steps. 

Oh the trail can surprise and reward. This sections was so maintained by hard trail working crews I cruised up West Peak. A steady grade with nice steps and this cool morning have me not breaking a sweat, hiking in long sleeves even. Tall spindly trees surround me. Sun rays falling through them to me. This north side is chilly so I keep moving on over the peak and down only go right back up Hay Mountain. Wide pleasant path, shadow like, I need a snack already my poptart has run out. A sign says this is Hay Mountain so I set down for a quick break. Facing back to the way in which I came a feel the presence of someone/something behind me….a dark image comes in my peripheral…shit Gracie you scared me. Corey didn’t want to startle me totally and she was out front and came on to me once she saw me. Hey guys, how was your night? They had stayed at Logan Brook last night, the lean-to I plan to have lunch at today. Corey says White Cap has a grand view and I ask if he saw Katahdin but he didn’t realize to look over his shoulder to locate. You take it all in for me Lead Dog I must move on to catch me ride later today from KI road, he says. 

More pleasant trail I walk with rock stepping stones pressed into the ground like a walk way. Sweet light continues to come in on me while I hike up a rock staircase to the end of tree line. Love these open crests. 9:00am and White Cap is capped.  Queen of the mountain. I set down on a make shift rock bench that resembles a throne. Scanning my kingdom there are so many lakes which they call ponds up here, miles and miles of forest, and not a sign of civilization.  Now to see THE mountain. I send a text to my team I am here and hope they are safe. Also send to Larry.

Following the blazes there she is, Katahdin, way far in the distance. Can’t be mistaken for anything else. Massive, I can see the rock slides all over her cuts, tree line is far from the top of the 5200 foot mountain.  Still hard to believe I’ll be there in 4 days. But first I must come off this last big mountain for awhile.
Heading for Loan Brook Lean-to I take my time on the down which again isn’t bad at all. Sloped for good footing and more path like. Wonderful hardwoods which I love. Seems like home hiking. I can smell embers so the shelter is very close and I hear water. Always a good sign. 

Taking my shoes off for a foot break while I sort out the remaining items in my food bag. I’d love to eat just about all I have now but I can’t. Must save something for supper and lunch tomorrow. Spam and a taco bell hot sauce packet on a pita will have to do. I sign in to the shelter log in case others want to know where I am and especially for my team to read. The text from them I received on White Cap stated they didn’t make it to Cloud Pond yesterday. They got in 15 miles to Long Pond which means they’ll have make up miles over the next 2 days. 

Finishing lunch I restock on water to get me to my destination East Branch Lean-To. Only 4 more miles to my hiking day. I’m loving this. 

More hardwoods walking with great trail. Sun abounds and I am feeling very comfortable in my surroundings. Guthooks say I will come to a road, really, it’s the wilderness? Sure enough a couple of day hikers come my way. You can always recognize, usually nothing much packed and they smell good. Ha. Maybe there will be trail magic at their car I wonder as we pass. 

No such luck. I’ll just have to eat a few more gummy bears and drink my Gatorade I mixed up over lunch. This combo is a fine energy source and is working well for me this trip. 

Open like woods leads me all the way to East Branch. Sections of blow downs, thick with sawed logs for passage now thank goodness, then pines and soft trail beneath. A blue bird day, some cool which was most appreciated. 

Stepping around the corner of the shelter two hikers are resting in their sleeping bags, 2:00pm. Sorry guys I didn’t mean to wake you. They continue their rest as I set my stuff to mark my place for the day/night. Checking out the area I go ahead and get my water for the evening. East Branch runs right below the shelter and there’s a nice place for setting which I plan to revisit later.

Sierra and her hiking friend started south trek at the same time. She is from Texas and has hiked the PCT. She says the AT isn’t anything like it but they have been doing 20 mile days. They like to take along nap during each day. She has a cold and hopes this rest will help. They pack up as 3 more SOBOs come in. These 3 are a mixed bag. It’s about 4 now and I’m wondering if they plan to stay but they are going on to Logan. Good shelter and nice spots to tent too I tell them. Trial by Error is hilarious. He’s a little ‘slow’ and tells me all about his random gear, what has failed and what he failed to use correctly. Food, oh man, did he have some food. This Big Dawg was watering at the mouth but couldn’t bear to ask for what he worked so hard to carry and did he have a load. But then he pulled out the giant block of parmesan cheese. Oh how that would go down great with Jim’s dehydrated beans he gave me before we packed out of Monson. Sure wishing now I had brought all he offered. I sorta mention how I wished I’d packed in some cheese and he graciously says how much you want? Nice, yogi magic. Then Tropical Jungle offer me dried seaweed. Uhhh okay I’ll try. Tasted like I was eating the ocean. Salty and not very good but calories I’ll take. Thank you. 

Their other friend was a flip flop hiker from MD who had hiked Georgia up to Harpers Ferry and flipped up to Katahdin. He had some age to theirs and seemed to be a good leader of these two. Shoot she thought she left her tent poles back when she started packing up her exploded pack just to get her food bag out. It was a crying scene but poles found deep in the pack liner. 

Gary comes in next. He’s a soon to retire administrator for the University of Oklahoma Foundation. He’s on his mission to finish the trail this trip having been out for about the same time as our trek. Been working on his completion for 12 years. We have lots in common there my friend. The three move on. While Gary gets settled in I venture back to river.

Writing my notes again in the evening sun is a nice way to wind down the day. These past two days have been quite different that imagined. Alone but not lonely.  Rested and not restless.  Fullfilling and still not yet full. Just seating here by the Pleasant.","Sidden Tappen Campsite

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600273,"Just as the sun was setting last night a hiker came in quick and plops down to access what he shall do next. 6:30pm  A fellow Gary says he has met before, he was from Anchorage, Alaska and longing for home. I asked if he was going to spend the night he said “I’ve just walked 30 miles today what’s a few more. Where’s the river?” It’s 0.2 down this way I point. “I’ll just cross it and I’m sure there will be place to camp” he grumbles. “I just saw that damn Mountain and I’m doing 30 more tomorrow”. When I asked him why? “Cause I want this over!” staring out into space. I’m sorry you feel this way I tried to console all the while being totally on the opposite spectrum of his feelings. Huffing he pulled his pack back on and headed out.


Last night the mosquitos where pesky. Gary and I swatted till past dark all the while talking to each other from our corners of the shelter. He mentions he gets up in the night frequently and hopes not to disturb me. No worries Mr. Gary I may get up in the “wee” hours myself. Well one trip I didn’t even hear him go out and then when a presence comes down on my head area I jump slap at whatever was coming for me!  Jumping back with a fright and Ohh, Gary says sorry so sorry I didn’t mean to encroach. Laughing I say its ok all is ok. He was so embarrassed.

Up early I want to get started for my 11 mile day. Its food drop day and better yet reuniting day with my team. But first let’s talk food, it’s all I’m thinking about.  Gary and I had our supper together chatting about our days up to now. My pinto soak worked well, thanks Jim, wrapped in a tortilla, sprinkled with that cheese and taco bell sauce (one of my favorite condiments if you haven’t noticed). This morning I had honey peanut butter on a pita. All that’s left in the food bag is a spam single, tb sauce and a roll of life savers to get me through till 4:00. Sure hope this trail is easy.

Crossing the river turned out to be an old hat now. Solid big rock to step one to another and I’m across easily. I see where Alaska spent the night, his tent place still dry and square where he slept.

Up and over the first small climb to Mountain View Pond my legs are a bit sluggish, it’s a grey morning too, I need some pick me up. Just get me over Little Boardman and then it’s all downhill and flat for the rest of the day. Sun starts to peak as I crest to from the north side of Boardman. Yes a sign it over. Lifesaver time and a quick text out if possible. I let me team know I’m making good progress to our rendezvous and will have their tent spots saved out.
  
Knees are barking at me a bit now. Slow down Martha you have all day to make your miles stop pressing. Easing off I take extra short steps and come into a better place. Still feeling sluggish I decide the next hiker I see I just might ask for a power bar of something and then I put that out of mind. A fellow approaches just as I am talking to myself. A SOBO hiker who says his friend just dropped out last night and he left him all this food. WHAT? Can this be?  A perfect opportunity, I ask and he provided. Here have some trail mix. I fill my left pocket with two handfuls. Oh and here have this breakfast bar, I don’t like them he says. Oh man did you make my day I say. The pick me up I sure needed!

Now that the tides have turned I’m cruising on this crazy good trail. Is this still in the wilderness?  Can’t believe it, boulevard path passing ponds having thinking about taking a swim. It’s heating up too so why not. Crawford Pond gave me the first chance to do so. Not the place for a full on jump in but bird bath works.

Cooper Brook comes in ear shot next. The trail traveled just above it for miles working me closer and closer to its shelter. I check guthooks and it’s just ahead. A side trail takes me down to good swimming right in front of the shelter. Being mid-morning 10:20 all hikers are out after last night and those passing are too early to come down here I hope. Perfect, skinny dipping time baby. A small falls just above me provides good water flow to keep leaches from settling to this hole I’m standing in. Refreshing and bath like I dunk under.

Drying on the large rock area in full sun I could close my eyes and take a nap. Well I don’t nap well so I just soak up the sun and watch the water glisten and gurgle as it rolls by. I reload my water and eat my last lunch. Its gonna have to be lifesavers till 4:00.

Long stretch of tall hardwoods with a wide forest road type trail runs for the next 3 miles making a few turns away from this brook but always returning back to it. A very calm and peaceful section, just me and the mosquitoes.  They just love calm and the backs of my arms.

Guthooks .4 to Jo Mary Road. I am excited to get there. 12:30 and my 11  mile day is done. Some areas for tents I'm here.  I find a good spot for 4 so we all can camp right here.  Cooper brook runs right behind me, my third opportunity for a swim.  

Finding a little path used by others to get down the bank I find a nice sunnin rock. Water runs over me while I cool off. It's a hot muggy day.  Drying in the sun I lay back gazing to the skies.  This wilderness ain't so bad.  These last 3 days have been some of my most enjoyable hiking over all these years.  The time alone with the trail has me feeling rewarded.  

I gather extra water so it will be available for my team when the come in. I wonder where they are and know once they hit this easy stretch will blow it out.  

Hungry my tummy growls.  Lifesaver time.  Gary has come in. He resupplied back at B road earlier this morning.  Said they arrived an hour early. Say maybe Shaws will be early for me.  Besides I remember other signed up for times before me too.  He hikes on.

Waiting at the road on a rock I set lurking down this lonesome long road.  Every minute between 3:00 and 4:00 I check the time.  Finding myself watching ants carry food and twigs back to their home I think, Bear Grylles would gather these for a nutritious snack.  

2 cars drive in and park above the bridge here.  Humm this might be a chance to yogi some food.  They are from NY and out to section to Katahdin.  One guy is finishing his 27 year quest.  Small talk lead to food talk and a cliff bar is produced.  You've just lightened my load the fella says and you my friend have made me evening.

Minutes before 4:00 they hike out.  I walk back to my tent, it's only yards from the road.  Not more than 3 minutes after 4:00 a van pulls in....Shaws hostel painted on the side.  Dawn's husband is driving and has picked up Sierra, she is taking time off to feel better.  Great news Lead Dog, I saw you crew at White Cap this morning.  They are on their way.  

Boxes of food and cold beer. YES! Here have this ginger ale He offers.  Helping to my site with all this stuff I tell him that I was dropped off by his wife and met them some years ago.  'You enjoy the rest of your hike and complete this trail' 

From famine to feast I dig in, washing this late lunch down with my PBR.  Humm I could tell my crew they didn't deliver the beer and drink them all. They'd never know!  Tempting but no I will place them in the brook for chillin.  

Closing in on 6:00 I have layed down in my tent to wait.  The skeeters can't get me in here either.  Rain fly rolled up I can see out and watch the trail.  A hiker or two have passed each saying they have seen them. 

I hear something, 6:03, Hootie hoot I shout out.  Nothing yet. I stand in the trail watching...then coming in hot It's TJ and then Jim.  Walking like they have been running rabbits all night.  Way to go guys, so proud of you. Where the girls?  Coming they are coming.  Anna comes in.  Feet flopping on the ground. I've got drop foot she says. Gotta get these shoes off.  Bones right behind, hiker hobbled but yet smiling with relief. 'I didn't set out to run this wilderness but here I am'. 

Shoes off, PBRs all around, cheers team.  They have worked so hard to get here. To get here for me.  58 miles in 3 days, doing what seasoned thru hikers questioned could be done.  They are something, really something.","East Branch Lean To

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600310,"Reunited and it feels so good. We all wanted more sleep this morning but have an 11 mile day and would like to have most of it for some rest and camp chores at White House Landing. We’ve heard many things about this stop, a boat ride from a side trail to get to the hostel, resupply and recreational amenities. 

With the old dawgs hurtin my group says get out front Lead Dog, we are in no hurry to run. Blisters and sore legs. Bones knee is somewhat out and has some swelling. Says her feet are a mess. Anna’s drop foot symptoms are subsiding. The boys seem to be in pretty good shape.  

The trail provided an easy hike for weary legs. Flat and not many obstructions. With in a couple of hours we’ve hiked to Antlers Campsite and a wonder view over Lower Jo-Mary Lake. Another cat ass day aka blue bird day. You choose your phrase. Food food we have food and are eating it up. Phone service too. We make connections to home and others. 

The trail turns away from the shore for hardwoods again and Virginia like trail. One ridge to get up and over, Potaywadjo. The skeeters are back out in full force. No breeze so better spray down. 
The kids are now out front leading our way and waiting at locations for all to move along together again. Next stop the shelter for first lunch. We’ll only have a couple more miles till the real fun begins.

Jim gives me a good stretch. Gotta keep these hammies loose. Lead on Lead Dog. A large lake comes in view beside us, Look, there’s Katahdin. We heard there was sight along here. We drop our packs and dart down thru the undergrowth to get a better view. Massive she stands over the wilderness, Pemadumcook Lake. So close, can I reach out and touch? Excited to get this full effect we gather for several photos.

Not far down the trail is our turn off for the landing. A side path .2 to a dock. We call the number listed in the AT Guide and also here at the dock for pick up. Note says use cell phone if you don’t have service us the walkie talkie. Some years ago the walk was 1.2 miles down to a cove and you blew an air horn to notify the owners you are here. 

Setting on the dock its 12:30, nice we have the rest of the day off now. I hear a motor. A standard size fishing boat pulls up, crazy about a Mercury! Bill says all aboard, loading our packs so we all have place to set. Who could believe we’d be zipping down a lake in the 100 mile wilderness. Funny too he thought I was bringing in a group of ladies with me. He didn’t realize our group was a ‘real’ hiking bunch. Ha. 

Rounding the bend his place is in full sight. Large moose antlers set high over the door on the main wooden cabin. Here is where we check in, get our resupply boxes, and gather for meals. Scanning his dry boards posted with food available for purchase and what’s on the menu for dinner and breakfast my mouth waters. ½ pound Burgers, Pizza and oh do you sell beer? Yes ma’am, I’ll take a round for the group please. Jim had heard about a $40 Bic lighter cost. Oh and that comes with 4 grams of complementary cannibas. Oh I better pass on that. I hear that stuff is bad for ya. Also on the counter where fresh baked goods and a box full of just picked sugar snap peas, FREE. I filled my hand full and chomped as the beverages were getting served. 

Individual cabins placed with just enough privacy lead our way to the bunkhouse. Grass, flowers and a garden too. The wash tub is down by the lake if you want to do your laundry by hand. Camp soap and a good dunk and scrub to clean your clothes. Clothes lines out back. Privy/Oval Office and shower house. 5 minutes wash please, we pump water uphill. 

I call first dibs on the shower. Two stalls so Anna comes on too so we can get laundry going. It’s a hot day and everything should dry. We air out packs, shoes and Tyvek. 

Bones has been called to medical duty. There’s an old man here needed her assistance. Pappy, what have you done to yourself? In a thick Lithuania accent he says, “Well I fell down. Ha ha “ Right leg is beat up pretty bad with deep open wounds. Bones pulls out her medical kit as do we to assist with any supplies that might be helpful. Pappy is 86 years old, the oldest to attempt a thru hike. He has hiked from GA to Front Royal and then came to Vermont. He jumped ahead and summited Katahdin and had to spend the night on the Abol Trail coming off. Ran out of gas and day light. There are 2 hikers who have just fallen in with him on this part and are working to get him to Monson. Hiking south now he will try to connect his trail. 

A real treat to talk with he graciously answers all our questions and provides his wisdom.  After he tells me he has hiked the PCT, CDT and many other trails he says, Where have you hiked? The AT mostly I plan to finish this trip, been working on it for 10 years and thought it would be nice to finish before I turn 50.  With a squint of the eye and smile on this face he says “What’s your hurry?” 

Resting time now. Laundry hanging out to dry. Blister repair administered. Legs up and cocktail time folks. I’ve shipped in my trail beverage thinking it would be a good way to wind down at the next two camp sites. I finish in 2 days ya know. Well let’s get the celebration on now, I don’t wanna carry it. 

Watching the water glisten with evening sun we wait for the dinner bell to ring. 7:00pm. I can smell the oven heating up. We are starving open that door Bill. His wife and he cook up burgers around with Anna getting a veggie pizza. If you’re not gonna eat that pickle I’ll take it. Wine, beer, sodas, cold water wash it all down. Dessert if you like. 

After supper that kayak down by the wash tub pulled TJ and Jim for an evening voyage. Us girls watch from a lake side bench. Can’t beat this for an evening “on the trail”.  Paddling out towards an island across the Pemadumcook Katahdin can be seen. So glad we came to this little place in paradise.","Jo Mary Road

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600492,"Loons called us to sleep last night. Some louder than others. I slept pretty sound waking up hungry for a big breakfast. Another fine day out. Cool morning air but warms up quick once the sun burns through the haze over the lake. 

Coffee and bacon aromas fill the lodge and breakfast is served family style, come fill your plates with eggs, fruit, English muffins, homemade strawberry preserves and AYCE pancakes. Pappy and his crew site with us again and tell more about hiking. He met some fisherman a day ago and they have caught him some trout and dropped off for Bill to fry up. Served up on a plate with his toast he smiles large and offers a taste up to all. We’d love to stay and chat more but we must go.

We have our gear down by the boat dock so we can be first out this morning. Having a 15.6 mile hike ahead of me I want to get moving. Checked out we get motored back to the trail. Thanks so much Bill I hope to come back for a week next time!

9:00am and we are hiking again. Great trail turns more rooty and runs close to another water way. A few side trails come in and a road or two like you could drive easily right to this area. More civilized than we thought. 

Nahmakanta Lake stretches for two miles with sandy beaches that the trail cut down to several times. Crazy are we at the Atlantic Ocean? Wish we could stay here but rain is forecasted. We are trying to beat it out and possibly all get in the shelter tonight so no one has to set up camp in the rain. Carrying a wet tent is no fun.

Trail turns back more wilderness like, time to start climbing soon. Nesuntabunt Mountain awaits.

Bees Bees, stop Martha don’t come this way. Anna got by without a sting but TJ and Jim both got zapped. Bones and I take the high side above a large tree stump and avoid. With all the commotion we’ve been caught up to by some of our hiking friends. Grumpy, Comet, Wallace and Ember.  They all plan to stop at the shelter for the day. Rain will change hiker plans quickly if they have the option to stay dry. 

We all meet up at Wadleigh Stream Lean To and have lunch together. Wallace plans to go back to the beach and swim before it might rain. Funny you’ll swim to get wet but not want to be wet when it rains. I’d rather stay here too but have some miles to make on my one account. I’m a mere 17 miles from my finish line. Holy cow, that’s tomorrow. 

Bones leads me up the big climb for today. Anna is out to beat the rain with the boys close behind or maybe they are in front I can’t see them anymore. My head is down plugging up this 700 foot climb. Straight up with a couple of false summits to beat all. Come on Lead Dog we got a view of Katahdin again. How far? I ain’t walking far TJ. Drop your pack it’s just right here. Gatorade in hand and gummy bears I follow. 

Clouding up now I can see a storm cresting the side of Katahdin. Hope that stays over there. Thick grey skies over us. I’m pooped after that climb and we still have 6 more miles. Good thing is profile shows pretty flat. I can only hope. 

With this storm looming it has a fire under Little Dawgs feet. Jim started call her this on their long 3 day push. He could hear Anna’s feet pounding right behind him and knew she was ready to run. Come on Martha we got to go Jim says.  He and the kids will go on ahead again and get shelter space for me and Bones. For them too but in case not enough room we two have the ‘golden tickets’ to get in first. 

Ember has come in behind us girls and says he will hike along with us too. He isn’t in any hurry and we all enjoy the conversation. He is a strong hiker, rough around the edges looking but a nice fella, well educated, humanitarian who lives off grid detached from material things.  He got his name from building fires to cook his meals each morning for the day and if no dry wood uses a candle. 

Fog begins to settle around us but not quite touching. Damp. Ponds passed with boats chained to trees from their owners who must have access to this dense place. We are in the Maine Public Land Reserve area. Needing some water Bones and I get a bit at Pollywog. I needed a rest anyways my push is about gone. 

Winding up now we are closing in on our shelter walking close to Rainbow Stream. I roars full of water and it really isn’t that full. Great looking water slide.  Ember says he will camp on past the shelter a bit as he doesn’t like them.  Hearing voices this must be it. SOBOs are all over this hill here above the lean to. Anna and TJ are set up here along with Jim. He come to greet us and says reservations have been made below for us. 

A small shelter with a baseball bat floor has a fella already lying down on one side, name is Highway. Then look who else is here..its the Rag Tag Sisters. They are closing in on their finish too. Glad to have a spot in the house with you ladies. I’ll be done tomorrow at mile 10, Rainbow Ledges I exclaim. 

Eating a hot meal will make me feel much better. Bones and Jim gathered water for us while TJ makes sure I have all I need to prepare my meal. Bones cleans my cook pot. Anna makes sure my feet are fit. All I have to do is just go to bed.  I have the best support team ever. 

What a rollercoaster of emotions today. Leaving the paradise of the Landing this morning to a tired state this eve. Fifteen plus miles has me quite tired.  It’s a good and tired feeling. If it were easy everyone would be doing it. And with only 10 more miles I will have done it.","White House Landing

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600993,"Everyone was up early and ready by 5:30am. Luckily it wasn’t pouring rain just heavy mist in the air and quite humid. There had been showers in the early morning hours and it woke me enough to worry about those camped on the hill.  They made it ok except for this one.  


Jim tells us of last night’s pre bedtime events with Trailer Swift. The name says it all I think. Southern girl trying to learn her way around trail. Jim noticed her tent was in a bad way of set up especially with rain coming. Then the conversation turns to chafing. Hey Lead Dog you got some body glide to help a girl out? You bet. Apply liberally and don’t tell me where all she put it I might need to use it yet today. 

Breakfast of poptarts for everyone. Pack covers on let’s roll out. Rainbow Ledges here we come.

Leading the way I push myself to keep a good pace. We have another high mileage day of 15 and I’d like to come in earlier rather than as late as last eve. The excitement to reach my last blaze and rain pending helps quicken the steps. 

Before we know it we’ve come 5 miles, Rainbow Spring Campsites, 7am.  The place is packed with tents and young groups camped. Some young gals chat with us and are very excited to hear about my finishing today. One is named Martha as well and is full of questions. I do believe she would have joined us if the chance presented itself. They will be camping for the next couple of days on their way to Katahdin. Say maybe we’ll see ya up there. 

Good forest trail leads me along for the next few miles and then our approach of Rainbow Ledges, our only climb of the day. Merely a blip compared to all the other climbs on this trip but I am breathing heavy with anxiousness.  Jim is close behind me talking as usual, ha ha, and reminisces of our first treks together. Short hikes and then some shake down hikes to ready us for long weekend adventures. Boy have we come along way my friend. 

Captain and Shortcut come to mind. Oh the miles we have walked together down south and then to this very ridge we head. Thoughts of Maine 2010 and how the 100 mile wilderness took us out early with Captain’s knee troubles. We made the best of a bad situation turning our trip into day hikes with him shuttling us gals around. Hence me having this location as a finishing point. Shortcut and I had hiked in from Abol Bridge to the Ledges and back to our basecamp at Abol. We had this wonderful view of Katahdin for our entire trip then and we also summited it at that time. Now here I am after my own knee troubles and by golly I’m gonna finish this thing out.

Every step up this rock runway my heart beats a little faster. It’s the 1 mile lap bell Jim says. Clouds cover us thicker and thicker as we gain elevation. I tell everyone of what a grand view this could be. Katahdin is in full view of the ledges on a clear day. I had visions of standing at the very spot Shortcut and I took our picture. But no mountain to be seen today. 

We are close I can feel it. I keep scanning the trail above me as we cut to the crest. Blueberry bushes, I remember these, and they are hanging full. No stopping now to pick I must hike. Down one little dip and back up another…Then I see it, a cross posted sign, Appalachian Trail Rainbow Ledges!!! This is it, This is it! Guys my last blaze! I touch the sign, me tagging the trail I am done, I have just completed the Appalachian Trail!  Tears well-up in my eyes. It’s taken some 10 years to get to this place and I couldn’t have done it without you guys. YOU ARE MY TEAM! 

I tell you right now as I type this I am crying just as I did then. It is real!  Sacrifices they have made many to get this ol Lead Dog up here and there. I love them so much. Tramily. 

Hugs and laughs, photos with friends it’s lunch time. Let’s eat. Berry picking time. 

It would be nice to say my hike was over at this point. Can someone get me a beer? But we have 6 more miles and Anna has the clock on us. We can make the road by 1:30 she says. I’ve texted Larry, Skyla and Patrick to see where they are in their route to meet us. This plan has been set for some time. They have driven up from Virginia for this big event. 

Coming into Hurd Brook shelter I recall this rock hopping to get to it. Glad the water isn't up or this could be trouble. Big rocks on end and not the best footing.  Don't fall I say to myself you are almost out.  Just 4 miles to the ""golden road"". 

Mine and Bones' feet are pounding.  She works on some blisters and her knee.  The girls group is here and they are still cheering me on.  Go Martha!  They ask if I am going to climb Katahdin.  Oh yes I have to do so with my team. 

Anna checks the time.  We can make 1:30 ya'll.  I wonder will Larry be at the trail when it comes out of the woods?  Will they even find the Abol Bridge store? Oh I hope this turns out.  

Misty wilderness turns to sun shadows.  Man is it gonna pop out now?  Maybe we'll get that shot of Katahdin from The bridge over the Penobscot I say.  Oh guys it is awesome.  

This easy stretch passes quickly with us chattering along.  It's hard to believe it all coming to an end.  These repeat miles have a different look and feel to me. I am rolling on satisfaction.  

TJ smiles while pointing at the exit sign of the 100 wilderness. Whoop Whoop we've made it out.  The Golden Road! Not at all what they expected nor I the first time here.  Just a long dirt logging road in the middle of nowhere.  Walking to the camp store we cross over the river on Abol Bridge.  I point to the left, no mountain, but it is there big and tall trust me.  

Hot, tired, and thirsty it's celebration time ya'll. Jim goes in to tall boy us up while I crash on this big setting rock outside the store.  I look up and the HIKUPIT ride pulls in.  L-train and family have arrived, right on time, 1:30!  

Wrapping my arms around my man,  I finished baby. I finished.  Proud!  Skyla and Patrick get big sweaty hugs too.  Thanks so much for coming all this way.  You guys rock!  Now let me get out of these shoes! 

Cheers all around, pictures and presentations.  My husband knows the way to my heart.  He has gotten a dear friend, Sandy from Damascus, VA, to create a colorful stained glass piece in representation of the trail.  A hiker’s vision.  Just magnificent.!

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600998,"After our mini celebration at Abol Bridge we hit the camp showers and did our laundry so not to kill over our family with hiker funk.  We opted for the closest accommodations outside the wilderness and Baxter State Park, Big Moose Inn.  Their Loose Moose tavern had all we needed last night to continue my celebration, large portion appetizers, burgers and beers. 

Today will be a day of rest and trying to let this body try to recover for one more day of trail time, KATAHDIN.  Oh I do dread the mountain.  I love that we are all going up together but I know it is no joke.  Quite hard and can be seriously dangerous in bad weather.  But that's not till tomorrow so let's enjoy today.

We meet up in the dining area for breakfast and to discuss the plan for Jim, Anna and TJ to hike the remaining miles from Abol to the park.  Only 10 miles, I say only because they do.  It is an easy section and they shouldn't have any trouble making great time.  Bones, wanna come? Nope. She is out for the count.  Feet trashed and she too wants to rest up and face the mountain she too has hiked.  Sometimes the unknown is best.

Patrick and Skyla volunteer to be their shuttle back to the trail after lunch.  Then Bones and I will get shuttled up to Katahdin Stream Campground later this eve.  We'll see them at site #10, the same site I stayed at 8 years ago.  

Packed extra light the Quick 3 are off and hikin.  Another hot day with some chance of rain but low.  They will out run it I'm sure.  

Trying to take an afternoon nap my thoughts were on writing so I did some journaling with moments of shuteye. 

Come Larry let’s see what all is around the inn.  Huts and many camper spot back up a lake behind the Inn.  There’s a rafting adventure and canoeing as well.  We did some shopping for food items and souvenirs at the adjacent gas station.  Hey there's a Baxter Beer. Let's try!  We can take some in to the gang later with their dinner.

After some family time in our outdoors area it time to sort my things for a night’s stay at the park shelter and what I might need for the hike tomorrow.  Day pack ready now to get my mind ready. 

Driving to the park was close, like 8 miles, but once in took longer than expected.  The ranger checks our passes and confirms we have till 10pm to get out or gates will lock.  Whew we thought it was 7:30pm and we are only an hour from that. 

The Tote Road runs the perimeter of the park, speed limit 25.  Not much signage to tell you directions at forks in the road, stay right, hope that's right?  Who's that walking ahead, but Ember.  He has finished his hike and walking to town.  We stop and introduce him to Larry and all.  Have a beer and they'll be back to give ya ride.  

Setting anxiously our 3 are at the campsite entrance.  Where have y'all been?  You could see the uncertainty in their eyes.  We've been done since 4:30. Hungry and thirsty we provide refreshment while they tell us all about their trip.

They have already registered at the ranger station here so Bones and I do the same.  The ledger has all our hiker friends we met between Caratunk  listed.  The girls group is here too. They plan to hike out at 2:30am to catch sunrise from the top.  Uh don't think that will happen with the forecast. Cloudy and 30% chance of rain.  That means any chance of rain =100% up above tree line.

Our site has room for 5 per shelter, picnic table and parking for two cars.  The family can easily drive back in tomorrow and meet us right here.  Jim provides his gps app to Skyla so she can see our progress and come in accordingly.  We plan to hike out before light and be off the mountain by 2.  

Knowing we have an early start and darkness will add another level of driving disability for Larry we say our goodbyes.

Another hot one, Can't believe how muggy these nights have been in Maine.  I'll take it over the cold and wind any day though.  Can only hope for a peek off the mountain tomorrow.  I close my eyes for one last night in an AT shelter and what better place than at the foot of 'The Greatest Mountain"".","Abol Bridge

Katahdin got its name from the Penobscot Indians. The Greatest Mountain.  The tallest in Maine at 5267 feet.  All up and then all down. It's a bit of a blur from 8 years ago but I remember this it was the hardest hiking I had ever done. Again Lord keep us safe.

Jim sets a steady pace and we are making good time over the first couple of miles taking a break at the Owl Trail junction and the falls.  Humidity. I'm wet without any rain.  

The larger rocks start to fill the trail.  What trail?  It's all boulders.  We have to work our way around car sized rocks finding a foot hold to step up.  I'm taking the tree path.  Jim points out better routes as he reaches the top of each.  Here Martha grab my hand was the main phrase.  

Gaining a 1000 feet per mile we reach The Cave...your last chance to retreat before going above tree line.  Above tree line can be a wonderful thing.  Just like the stretches over Saddlebacks and the Bigelows.  Wonderful views under wondrous skies.  Oh but here the chances of summiting under such is like 10%.  

Fog engulfs us and thickens with every step. Instantly everything is wet with moisture.  And now we have not only king size rock we have slick rock.  Luckily this mountain is a granite mass so we have some grip under foot.  But the sandpaper like grit wears on my hands trying to get a hold.  Rebar stationed in craggy places to aid in our climb have been added by the trail crews.  Say can you guys put in an escalator? 

Wind begins to strengthen with each false summit. Jackets go on for protection.  Bones takes the lead with the blazes becoming less visible with these thickening clouds. We are above heaven I do believe. 

Steeper and steeper the rocks go on and on.  I hear voices.. It the girls on their return.  You are almost at the Gateway they tell us.  Go Martha Go!  

I get hung up at the Hillary Step..  No not Everest, my name for this desperate state I've found myself in trying to make a long step to safe footing, don't twist a knee, will this knee hold, and oh yeah the wind is 50 mph thrashing me around.  Staff assist staff assist.  (Anna's term from her work when someone is in need of help.)  

4500 feet and then it gets quiet.. The wind is calm. We've reached the Gateway.  The only simulation of flat on this monster.  We keep pressing. Don't stop you'll get cold quick.  Handful of gummy bears will have to do.  Maybe we can eat here on the return?  

Trail turns to large scree, pitching my feet from side to side, I'm a staggering fool.  I can hardly see each of the next blazes ahead for looking down at my feet.  The trail turns left I don't remember this.  We have to be getting close.  Where's The sign?

Scanning my stunted field of vision, glasses fogged, wind picking up again and oh goody, now some rain.  I think I see Jim by something.  Anna, TJ, Bones....

KATAHDIN, Baxter Peak, Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  Woo Woo. We've made it. 9:00am. 

Socked in completely we don't even care.  It's celebration time.   A couple is here before us and takes our group summit photo on the sign.  Arms raised in glory. Wait I want one up on the sign too, not having one before. I can't reach the step, Grumpy comes to help and offers his knee for me to step on. A wind gust about blows me off but I regain balance and stand 'almost' tall for a ‘Rocky’ photo.

We all take our turn before all our friends arrive.  Wallace, Grumpy, Comet, Radio and Charmed they all have completed their thru-hikes.  Wallace says now what? Guess we'll just have to hike off.  

Now you think going up was bad, shit the down is always worse.  Feeling like you are going to fall and break something or topple to your death is most nerve wracking.  Tediously Bones picks our way back but now we not only have to repeat trouble we have to contend with those coming up.  Waiting at ledges and coming down slanted rock with people below you takes more time.  What took us 4 hours to climb will take us 5 to come down.  Many times I wanted to tell folks Turn Around, Retreat.  Some asked if they should and I did say yes.  A few did.

Wishing for cover below tree line couldn't come fast enough as I managed most of the down sliding on my ass.  Big girl doesn't do well with stepping down over crevasses.  TJ assist TJ assist.  Encouraging me to take the leap of faith and trust it he helps me down many precarious places.  

Fog rolls away and the sight of trees has me smiling and hoping for the best for those still up there.  Finally I can take a break and gather myself.  My legs are quite spent, the right leg has taken the brunt of the down, me protecting the left and is cramping terribly with pain.  Stretching helps some.  We carry on.

Skies try to lighten. We can see some side views now of the other ridges to the mountain.  The trail runs with water that I didn't remember from this morning. The crew helps me over the last of the big rocks each adding a hand when needed.

Times a ticking and Little Dawgs on the run, Jim too.  Bones and TJ hang with me.  Full on hiker hobble now for me and Bones showing signs of what the mountain has done to her too. 

Looks who's coming here? Patrick, he has come on up to meet us.  Says Larry and Skyla are at the falls.  Wow this is great above tree line he says.  All these rocks.  TJ and I chuckle. Uh this ain't it, tree line ends about 2 more miles up from here.  And if you wanna see rocks, oh there's your rocks.  Happy to have his company they travel on down.  

Larry comes insight shortly.  Hey Old Woman, you coming?  Ha. Jim comes back to check on me too.  Come on Lead Dog everyone is at the falls, I have the phone set up for a family photo.  

We filled the bridge over Katahdin Stream Falls.  CHEEZE!   Now let's wrap this trip up and have a cold one at the bottom.  

And that we did. Me and Larry bring up the rear finishing by 2:00.  It was celebration station at site #10.  Our mission is complete. Thank you family and friends.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601015,"After the big mountain we closed out our campsite with a toast and packed the rig to the max. People and packs loaded up for two night’s stay in Millinocket. I planned in an extra day in case the weather we too bad to summit, well it was bad but it could have been worse. So we have Thursday for a cushion day, rest and eating all we can, and time with Larry, Skyla and Patrick. 

We had the whole second floor to ourselves at the AT Lodge. Old Man and Navigator have a great place here. Clean rooms, laundry, and shuttles if you need. We visited there other establishment the AT Café. I signed in with my colorful magic markers on the ceiling tile as all finishing hikers are allowed to do. It sure felt good to be a part of this elite group not to mention my own. 

We closed down every bar in town, which was all of one, over the next two days. Having booked our transportation home with my team I kissed Larry good-bye on Friday morning so he, Skyla and Patrick can get their drive started back south. The rest of us depart tomorrow for Portland.

Reaching Portland via shuttle it’s the bus and train thang. We were so happy to reach Bonnie’s place again in Scarborough. She has opened up her home for us to stay the night and provides a wonder meal to boot. Bet she never guessed this VA girl she met 2 years ago on McAfee Knob would call on her for such services. She shuttles in the wee hours of the morning to boot.  We had to catch our bus to the Amtrak station in Boston by 4:45am. 

Boston is our departure spot where Bones splits off from us. Another who would have guessed how random trail meet up would add this fine New Englander/Texan to our group but it did. Four years running she’s jumped a plane to fall in with our team. She makes our Party of Five.

So as we go our separate ways the trail always draw us back together. Even with me finishing it’s not the end of my trail miles. I plan to keep hiking with my team as they continue their quest of completion.  

Slim Jim only lacks 120 miles. 19 in the Shenandoahs and the remaining in northern PA/Delaware Water Gap. Look out Deer Head Inn, the oldest jazz continuously running jazz club in the country, here we come. 

Tiny Pants has completed 865 miles and plans to knock out what’s lacking in Virginia next. He and Ann both have all the northern states from Delaware Water Gap to Katahdin. (Anna missed our NH trek over the White Mountains so any time she’s ready to go I’ll be happy to go hut to hut and really enjoy that wonderfully hard and breathtaking country). 

But first ol Lead Dog’s gonna take a year off from big trail planning. It’s time to enjoy a full summer at home with Larry and play some more golf. If I had to say what trail next the Long Trail in Vermont running up to Canada and the Benton MacKaye Trail here south are on the radar but like a wise hiker told me what’s the hurry.","Millinocket
