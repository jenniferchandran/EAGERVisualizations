Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600700,"After having an attempt never fully get of the ground in 2013, I'm ready to go. 37 hours on Greyhound buses from Louisville to Bangor and a couple of days with friends in Ellsworth, the time has come for these anxious feet to hit the trail. This trail has been on my mind nonstop through ups and downs, college sports and tedious days on the job. Countless miles hiking in Arizona while in college simply kept reminding me of what I wanted to accomplish eventually, and the fact that I'm actually starting today has me busting at the seams with so many different emotions. Nervousness followed by fear then giddiness. I guess all that I can do now is start walking south! ","

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602065,"Leaving Bangor around 3:00 AM Kyle and I pulled into Katahdin Stream Campground around 6:45, and after checking in with the Ranger for my AT Pass and saying goodbye I began up Katahdin at 7:15. There had been rain all morning, and the climb brought me into the clouds and a constant mist. After the super steep section climbing out above the tree line I hit the tablelands and it got windy. The moisture and the wind was really chilly, so when I hit the summit I stayed long enough to snap a few photos and tell myself that now it is actually beginning. Once I start heading down from the sign I was officially attempting my southbound Appalachian Trail thru hike. I flew down the 5.2 mile Hunt trail back to KSC, dropped of my day pack, got my heavy pack with enough food for the 100-mile wilderness, ate a lunch of tuna and ramen and was on my way. Still having right at 10 miles to get out of Baxter State Park so I could camp made day 1 long, 20 miles, but luckily the was no fordings and it was all pretty much downhill to Abol Bridge. I set up camp at Abol Pines campground on the banks of the Penobscot River and knocked out after a long first day.","

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602066,"After a long first day, I didn't get out of camp until almost 10:00. Crossed over the Penobscot river and down the road until I turned left into the woods and the 100-mile wilderness. It was 100 miles from here to Monson, and my next resupply. The day ended up being fairly slow and easy, with one climb up to Rainbow Ledges and a view of Katahdin, which like the previous day was covered in clouds. I ended up setting up camp at the Rainbow Lake campsite with a lot of NOBOs. There was a really cold piped spring right on the shore of the lake with a beautiful view. ","

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602067,This day brought some more bogs which became the norm for the 100-mile. It also brought my first somewhat difficult climb since Katahdin up Nesuntabunt Mountain leading to a great view of Nahmakanta Lake below and Katahdin out in the distance. Then down the mountain and along the shore of the lake for the next few miles to where I camped at a campsite near the south shore of the Nahmakanta.,"

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602068,"After a beautiful hike along a lake shore the day before this day brought me along the shores of many more lakes and ponds in the aptly named lake region of Maine. The ponds up here can be called lakes if you ask me. The hiking was fairly flat on day 4, all the way into Cooper Brook Lean-to which was my first night at a shelter, even though I set up my tent nearby I got to hang out and chat with other hikers out on the trail. Mostly section hikers were there. I was one of only two thru hikers that night, the other was headed north.","

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602069,"This day was a short one. 3 miles in brought me up to the top of Little Boardman mountain, down near a few more ponds then the clouds began to roll in. They were thick, and I had my first real mountain since Katahdin, White Cap Mountain. As I started up the 2,400ish-foot climb the rain began to fall and the wind started blowing. After about 3 miles and 1,100 feet I came to the Logan Brook Lean-to and decided to pull in to see if I could wait out the worst of the rain which looked like it was still to come. After waiting for a couple of hours and the rain still coming down I decided that since I was dry at that point it didn't make much sense to go out, keep going, get wet and set up a tent in the rain, I spent my first night in a shelter with 2 NOBOs and 2 section hikers who were at the shelter the previous night.","

Phaedrus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602070,"Waking up to a humid morning, but no rain got me ready to hike, and when you add the fact that I didn't have to break down my tent I got out pretty early. With 1,300 feet left to climb of White Cap I headed up into the wind and chilly air to get my last view of Katahdin before going down the south side to the West Branch Pleasant River and my first true ford. I had to take off my shoes and socks, put on my sandals and wade across the river. On the other side I ate some food while feet dried, got my shoes and socks back on then kept on walking. This brought me up Chairback Mountain, which was a much more difficult climb that it looked like it would be and into my stealth spot near West Chairback Pond.","

Three and a Half, Fourth Mtn, and Barren Mtn, before dropping down into Wilson Valley. The ridge with the mountains brought some beautiful views and my first cell service since before I started. I had two more fords on this day, across the Big Wilson and Little Wilson streams, but luckily I set up camp on the south side of Little Wilson Stream.","

I had the intention of trying to get into Monson before 11:00 because I had a package at the Post Office and because it was Saturday that's when they closed. But alas, I was about an hour too late. It was okay though, I got a ride from Gary from Shaw's Hiker Hostel which is where I intend to stay so it worked out in the end.","

Abol Pines campsite is where I set up that first night and began into the 100-mile wilderness on day 2. The next 7 days  have kinda all run together at this point, but after about 13 miles on day 2 I camped at Rainbow Spring campsite alongside a number of NOBOs. Day 3 brought me to the south shore of Nahmakanta Lake, and day 4 pushed me over halfway to the Logan Brook shelter around mile 58. The next 3 days were where the ascents and descents began, but I pushed through them feeling quite strong, stealth camping for the next 2 nights until getting into Monson and Shaw's Hiker Hostel last night. Shaw's is an awesome place, hot showers good people, and an even better breakfast. The plan is to get out and start southward towards Stratton, ME today at some point. I'm not sure how service will be in southern Maine, but I will update when I can! But for now, have a nice way!","

Just after 1 I said goodbye to my NOBO friends and headed back towards the trail, up Horseshoe Canyon on my way to Bald mountain. The trail was only slightly inclined for the 10ish miles I put down into a stealth camp spot along the Bald Mountain Stream at mile 128.","

I had about a 4 mile approach before I hit Moxie Bald Mtn. Which was a steep 1,400 foot climb with a great view from the summit. Down the other side, rock hopped across Baker Stream which if it were any higher would have been another ford, and then began the 5-mile ascent of Pleasant Pond Mtn. Taking the climb fairly easy I got to the top around 4:30 in the afternoon and sat up top for a bit to just take in the scenery and beautiful sunny weather. Deciding to head down I cruised through the descent into Pleasant Pond Lean-to and set up my tent a bit to the south. Leaving roughly 6 miles into Caratunk and the Kennebec River ferry crossing tomorrow around midday hopefully.","

Just beyond Caratunk is the Kennebec River, which is the largest unbridged water crossing on the AT. There is a ferry service, which consists of a canoe and Joe to paddle you across. Signing the waiver and getting my bag in, and life jacket on we paddled the Kennebec and I got out on the other side. There was no wait, and no one else was there, so now I continue walking south, up a thousand foot climb and to the carry ponds which were used for portage back in the day. I found a nice little stealth spot along the north shore of East Carry Pond. ","

Then down around the south outlet of Flagstaff Lake to the base of Little Bigelow Mountain. I got my first trail magic at a road crossing here by Rowdy, who I met at Shaw's, she was dropping off some other hikers and I happened to show up, and got a beer which was a great pick me up!

A steady first few miles took me over ME17 which had a height of land view, pretty cool place. Crossed paths with a Voyager who is on the final leg of his 2nd triple crown and he gave me some fantastic advice: find something to shout about every day, good or bad. I've since taken that to heart, and it helps release that pent up energy or frustration, especially while doing a solo hike.

Slowed me up a bit, took about an hour and a half to get through that mile, which is just a jumbled pit of boulders you have to go over, under, around, or squeeze through. Then a steep climb immediately afterwards onto Goose Eye Mtn. Following this came Mt. Carlo and dropping down into Carlo Col I crossed into New Hampshire, completing my first state of the A.T. After 282 miles. Maine was rugged, and difficult, but extremely beautiful. I made it another 5 miles or so to Gentian Pond where I set up camp.","

So I put on my rain jacket and headed up the Wildcat Ridge in the wind and rain. It was a rough ridge, the trail was super rocky and hard to maneuver. The worst was the descent to Pinkham Notch in the rain. A 2000' drop over 1.5 mi which is very steep, rocky and extremely slippery and no fun when wet. Definitely the most sketched out I have been yet. So I rewarded myself with a coke and a sandwich at the Pinkham Notch visitor center before making my way up to the Osgood tent site where I stopped for the night.","

Of course I was in the clouds the entire day, and visibility was only 1/16th of a mile. I was simply hiking cairn to cairn because I couldn't see any further. It was like hiking on a different planet, eerie but cool at the same time. The weather was good, calm winds and temps in the mid 50s, just in the clouds. Getting to the summit of Mt. Washington I entered ""the zoo"" and that holds multiple meanings. For us hikers it's a zoo simply because there is so many people that are up there. Then it feels like we are the animals at a zoo, people were literally asking for pictures with me and asking nonstop questions, a very odd dynamic. Anyway, headed down and got to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut and got in for some work for stay up above the tree line.","

The views were incredible, of what I had Dane over the last few days, and of what I had coming up. I couldn't have asked for better weather, but due to it being a Saturday there were so many people on trail it took away from the tranquility.

I began down as the pale dawn light broke the night. Got to Kinsman notch and NH112. After hanging around for a bit i started up Mt.

I had a few small climbs and smooth trail all the way into Hanover, NH where i am going to get off trail for a couple of days and stay with some family. After only one day off it will be nice to take a few days to recover from Maine and New Hampshire before attacking the rest of New England and the Mid Atlantic which will bring the autumn colors and a different hiking style than the ruggedness of these last two states. When I get back on trail I'll be starting into Vermont, which is state number 3 of 14!","
