UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584565,"Welcome to UJ's trail blog.   I read a National Geographic story about the trail in the 70's and hiked all over Wisconsin, then followed hikers in TJ for the last 5 years. It's my turn to hit the trail on Tuesday April 10th, if all the remaining prep goes as planned.   
Work has been notified and been gracious enough to offer a job when I get off trail. Woohoo ! Working to get the last of the details in place so my house can be on auto pilot while I am gone.  Arranged for the lawn to be mowed (Thanks Big Mike!), but need to pull in some favors to have the weeds kept under control, etc.  At least the neighbors are used to things NOT being 100% neat & tidy so it will seem normal !
The first few journals entries are on a computer, so I have yet to figure it out on the phone.  One adventure at a time !

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584951,"In two weeks I plan to start my Flip-Flop hike of the A.T.  The south is cold, snowy & crowded at this time of year.  Hikers starting now have to hussle to reach Katahdin before the snow gets too deep, and the mountain closes October 15th, or earlier.  I have decided that  a Flip-Flop hike suits me better.  I will start when the average low temperature is 40F, head north into Maine in June/July (how bad will the black flies be??).  I plan to get down to Georgia before the average low temp drops below 40F.  That might avoid the worst of the snow.
I plan to take Amtrak to Harpers Ferry, WV which is about in the middle of the trail, and has a station within a few feet of the trail.  No shuttles or other hassle needed.  I will visit the headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (Appalachiantrail.org) to register, get fuel at the outfitters since you can't take that on the train, then head north into Maryland.  I plan to let my body tell me how far it can go, so will probably take about 3-4 days to get into Pennsylvania/Rocksylvania, 41 miles away.   Hikers who start in the south fly thru this area since they have been hiking for three months.  I will be moving at a crawl compared to them.  I hope to say hi to Opa as he should pass me about 2 weeks in.   We will see how much of the Feb/March bubble of hikers catches me before I get my trail legs.
It looks like I won't see a mountain above 2000 feet until the Connecticut-Massachusetts border, 475 miles in.  That might get me a chance to get in shape for the nastiness of the mountains to come.
Returning to Harpers Ferry in July for the second leg will be a bit hot.  The average high temperature in Virginia is 86F in July and August, so that will be tough.  I would rather cook than freeze, I think.  Finding a nice tree to siesta under in the afternoon might help.  After all these years living in Wisconsin, the cold should be fine.
I'll put together a few more posts before heading out, mostly to test blogging on the phone instead of a desktop.  That will be another adventure !

We parted ways at Washington Monument State Park since he has to return to his family. He held me slower and I pushed him farther. The trail does provide.

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588499,"Hi All;  It has been a while since I updated, since I have been really uncertain what the future holds.   The knees weren't badly damaged, just the tendons on the front got inflamed so that walking down stairs or cliffs they would scream in pain, so I knew if I did not listen they would fail me at some point.  The trail was not worth permanent damage to me. After two weeks of rest, Vitamin I and ice the first week, they are pretty good.  The left still gets a little sore after walking for a mile or so, but is better every day.  I am thinking that next week I should be out somewhere hiking.  Before I get into too much detail, I want future hikers to know my opinion about the AWOL guide and Guthook app, whichI used both.  AWOL was poor for trail information, but great for town & hostel info. It never showed a hill over 1600 feet in the first 470 miles, but I did three over 2000 feet in one day.  I debate  if I would take it when/if I returned to the trail.  Twice it showed info about a restaurant & resupply that hikers who only had Guthook did not know about.  It was useful but not necessary with Guthook.   I would NEVER attempt the trail again without Guthook.  The elevation charts meant that I knew the steepness of the trail and had real-time info about road crossings, water, shelters, etc.   The GPS location worked great, some people complained about it, but they seemed to not want to let it re-sync with the sattelites - that took about 10 seconds whenever openning the app.  My mom really appreciated getting an email everyday that had a non-techninal way to show exactly where I was & what was around me.  The link to G-maps worked great for 70+ year olds.  I would ask the developers for a way to enter an email address or so I did not have to type it by hand every time.  Maybe I just ever figured it out.   For this week I am doing a bit of research on trails and going back to my nephews school to coach the Bellin Kids for Running program.  There are some great kids there, who help to restore my faith in the next generation.  I want to give a shout out to Chris & Gruff.  Out of the 5 people who were in the shelter where I camped the first night, he was the only one to stop by and treat me like a person.  THree others walked right past my tent and never said a word to me.  We had good talks, and I am confident that you will succeed in your new venture.  Gruff is a GREAT dog, and I might try getting a dog after I finish this trail business.  We had two as kids, but I thought they were too much work.   Gruff may have changed my mind.  FYI, I thought the trail name you picked reflected the OLD you, vs the new you, so I didn't use it here.   Thank you again for shifting your sevtion hike so they we could hike together for another half day. The last two days on trail were a struggle because of the rocks and steep hills.  There was stretch before Smithburg, MD with a 3 mile hike on a bolder puke.  My feet did not touch soil for those three miles.   Having to carefully watch each and every foot placement took the fun out of hiking for those miles.  I think that also led to the knee issues.   People on the trail said Pennsylvania is rockier than MD, so that does not encourage me.   Starting in GA now that the snow is gone, would rush me to push hard to make Maine before snow flies.  I am looking into another option this week.   I would hate to waste the time off of work that my boss so gracious allowed, so will do something.  There will be atleast one more update later this week when I decide what the next step is for me.","Trail of Hope Hiker Hostel

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589650,"Sorry for the long lapse in updates.  It's hard to have to borrow a friend's computer or go to the library since I canceled my cable & internet before I left for the AT.  Journalling on the phone is too frustrating.There are several National Scenic Trails in the U.S.A., the most famous are the AT, CDT and PCT.  They are long and hard, as I learned a few weeks ago doing 60 miles of the AT.  My knees were nto ready for the rock pounding that I endured.  Other Trails include the Florida Trail, one in Arizona, and the Ice Age Trail.   The Ice Age Trail is about 50 year old, and still not completely off roads.  It runs about 1,200 miles roughly following the extent of the last glaciers the covered North America until about 10,000 years ago.  It starts in scenic Door County (vacation destination for millions of people) at Potawatomi State Park.  It is now on trails about 60 miles through Algoma, Kewaunee and Manitowoc, passing many small towns in between.  While waiting for my knees to get healed enough to maybe have another go at the AT, I decide to warm up with slack packs hikes.  The first 200 miles of the trail are about 1 hour drive from home, so I decided to do some sections to prove out the knees.The tendonitis continues to get better, so much so that I can't stand not being in the woods.  I know it's early, but I have to get back on trail.  I scoped out a road atlas that seems to show that it's about 5 miles from The start of the IAT to a trail head in Sturgeon Bay's industrial Park.  Let's go !The trail from the park trailhead to the official start is my kind of hiking.  The are lots of rocks, but unlike much of the AT, there is dirt in between and great views of the harbor.  About a half mile in I got reminded of the rocks on the AT.   There are down hills on the escarpment that I am told is part of the same rock formation as is carved out at Niagra Falls in NY.  The hill and rocks last only about 1/2 mile and I come out along the shore of Sawyer Harbor.  Cedar trees, rocks and shore line.  This feels right.  There are birds and squirrels and a few brave campers.  As I got to the ""beach"" near the campground, my tendons are not happy.  I sat down for a snack, watch the view from the rocky beach, and dig into my new book.Melanie McManus hiked the Ice Age Trail in 2013 and wrote a book called Thousand Miler: Adventures Hiking the Ice Age Trail - available from the Brown County Library as soon as I finish it!I have completed only 1.5 miles or so but IO am debating on whether or not to continue.  My earlier estimate of dstance is wrong, as a sign shows me that there are 2.8 miles of trail in the park.  The map of the trail segment that I got from the trailhead shows that it's about 5 miles from the park to the trailhead where I left my bicycle.  I don't think my knees can take 6.5 more trail miles then riding my bike back to the car at the tower.  Dag-nammit, more waiting for the healing.  I slowly road walk back to the car, pick up my bike and hang it for now.  What am I going to do next?   Is it time to call the boss and go back to work?  Do they have enough work to need me yet?  arg.","Eastern Terminus of the IAT at the Tower in Potawatomi State Park

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589653,"Okay, the title says Day 5, but it's really only the second day on the Ice Age Trail.  There is a page for the IAT here on trailjournals, but it looks like it was not updated since 2015.  Easier for me to stay here where I have shared links with some family and friends. Others have said that you need to count days off the trail as days of the journey, even if it's for medical, so my 2nd day of hiking is day 5.  Maybe I should re-hike those first miles so I can say it's fewer days?  No, that's pointless like the PUD's on the AT.After a weekend that saw me using my legs too much, I just can't stand sitting around.  My brother bought a new house, so we moved some boxes - why are the heavy books going upstairs??  We took a drive to see Dells of the Eau Claire near Wausau, WI.  It's a river that passes over hard rocks that forms rapids and waterfalls. Pretty cool and I wonder why I never went there before. Definitely worth visiting if you are in central Wisconsin.  The Ice Age Trail passes thru the park, and I can't resist hiking along the river.  Knees go sore but they worked.Monday  I dropped off the bike at the same trailhead as last week to see if I can make a few miles.  I love the trails in this park, and came here  weekly when I lived in Sturgeon Bay.   The trail starts off nice & smooth with some minor rocky climbs in the 1.5 miles of trail I have left in the park.  Walking along the shore with the cedar trees, birds chirping, wave crashing on the rocks - this just feels so right.  I thought about the book I am reading (Thousand-Miler by M. McManus) who went by the trail name of Valderi - and I caught myself humming that hiking tune.  This kind of hiking is so much more fun than the AT.  There are not as many people out here, but I can actually look up and watch the trees, beach, and fresh new plants as I hike.The trail eventually goes into the small town of Sturgeon Bay with quaint shops and that small town feel.  The knees got pretty tired by the time I got to the top of the hill on the Sawyer side of town, so I took a break at the skate park on the hill to snack, hydrate and enjoy the view of the town and water.  Nice.The trail is on sidewalk like paths until passing thru Cherry Blossom Park, where it is back to Rail to Trails type trails.   Flat smooth gravel past a few farm fields and small factories.  I reach the trailhead and feel pretty good.  There are no benches or picnic tables at the trailhead, so it's on the bike and retrace my steps to get accurate distance check.  It was odd to ride the same path I just hiked.That afternoon I had to get to school for the Kids 4 Running.  I have been a volunteer coach here for 9 years.  The program is a partnership between a local hospital group and schools to encourage kids to run.  41 years ago the hospital group started a 10k run.  For the 40th anniversary there was something like 25,000 runners!  I think the website is bellinrun.com","Potawatomi State Park Campground

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589654,"Day 6 on the Ice Age Trail,  added 11 more miles between Sturgeon Bay and Forestville for a total of 19 miles.Yesterday went so well, and the legs feel good, so I decide to drop of the shuttle vehicle (my bike) at the Forestville Dam county park.  The car gets dropped at the trailhead in Sturgeon Bay just off highway 42/57 in the industrial park.  This part of the trail takes advantage of the snowmobile trails, which are built on abandoned railroad tracks.  These tracks were part of the Anahpee & Western Railroad that moved logs and over heavy freight in the local area.This is my kind of hiking.  THe trail is smooth and well groomed.  There are birds and other animals everywhere.   In just the first hour I see Sandhill Cranes, Canadian Geese, Mallard Ducks, a red-headed woodpecker, red-winged blackbirds, and several turtles sunning themselves on logs.  I hear at least 5 different birds that I don't know the species of, but hear often enough n these woods.  Flowers are starting to appear including cow-slips, trilliums and a few tiny flowers I never learned the names of.  The woods are alive.    Later in the hike, when I am starting to get bored, I catch a spot of color near my feet.  There is a small blue moth flitting about my shoes, so I stop to look.  Right there are some huge white-tailed deer tracks that I would have missed if not for the moth.  This tells me to stop & smell the roses, dummy!  I stand and look around, and a movement in the trees catches my eyes - is that an oriole?  Yes, by golly it is, the first I have seen in years.  This is my kind of hiking.  As I approach Forestville I see dozens of elevated deer stands.  Here in Wisconsin hunting white-tailed deer is an old family tradition, learning passed down from father to son or uncle to nephew & niece.   If there are this many deer stands, and that much deer damage to the trees there must be deer.   I slow my pace and peek around trees - and there they are, two white tails bounding away from me.  Fun.My legs feel so good that I decide to run with the kids today instead of biking, and the knees make it all right.   hmm, maybe I should be looking at thru hiking instead of just day hiking?  Well it's still May and we get snow sometimes yet in May.  Need to look at the weather.Quote from Albert Einstein:  The person who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd.  The person who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever seen before.","Sturgeon Bay Trailhead

UJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590573,"Catching up on journals...Wednesday Day 7.  0 miles.  I dropped my phone last night and shattered the screen, and my legs were really tired with 11 miles hiking, 11 miles biking and 3.5 miles running with the Kids4Running.  I thought I should listen to my body and take the day off.  It also weighed on me that there are not many people on the trail, so without a phone, if something happened, I might be sitting out there a while.  Thursday Day 8.  8.5 miles for 27.5 total.  I dropped my bike off at County D west of Algoma, planning a short day with a slow start and running club this afternoon.  It started out fantastic and got better as the day went on.  Leaving the Forestville Dam County Park, the trail follows the Ahnapee River for miles.  There is no way to describe the birds that welcomed me to the trail except a cacophony.  They were all calling and talking over the top of each other, so that few of the individual calls could be made out.  This went on for about 20 minutes until the trees changed to swamp.  The Cranberry Swamp caused real problems for the Ahnapee & Western Railroad that was built here in the 1890's.  It carried people and goods from the port in Algoma (which used to be called Ahnapee).  The port was busy with goods on the way from Chicago & Milwaukee on their way to Green Bay, since that saved a few days of travel and avoided the dangerous strait at the top of Door County called Death's Door because so many ships sank there.  It is believed that the first ship wreck on the Great Lakes was at Death's Door by a ship names Le Griffin about 500 years ago.  I stopped to check out a park called Blahnik's Heritage Park.  I asked a woman there if it was the Blanik family farm, since I had worked with a man named Blahnik that was from the area.  SHe wasn't sure, but did say the land was donated by the Blahnik family, hence the name to thank them for their generosity.  I leanred her name was Chris, and it was fun to watch her get her four daogs out of the car and on leashes.  The youngest was just 6 months, and she wanted my help to train him in meeting new people.  What, you want me to play with your cute puppy?  Yippee!   We walked and talked for over a mile, and I was impressed that the older dogs were so well trained that when they chased a smell into the woods, Chris would tell them to ""Fix it"", and they knew to untangle themselves.  Impressive!  The puppy was still learning this!Friday Day 9.  12 miles from Cty D by Algoma to Casco Junction.   This is not officially par tof the trail, but the official trail is only on roads.  I thought it silly to walk on roads when there is a nice path to follow.  It was 40F when I started and stayed cold all day.  At one point it was sleeting, then a little freezing rain. With the rain there were few animals about, so a bit of a boring day.Well, I gotta run, so will include the really cool bird calls that I heard when I update my hike from the 14th & 15th.  I need to talk to the neighbor that is an expert on birds to learn what kind that was.","Forestville

This section I think was part of the Green Bay, Kaukauna & Western Railroad 100+ years ago.  The roads weren't good enough to haul heavy freight, and using the rail saved the time to sail ships around the Door County Peninsula.The trail was great again today, but a bit hot.  There are not enough benches along the trail to really enjoy it, but I suppose they are a travel hazard for the snowmobilers.  I finally found one over looking a small pond about 7 miles in.  I read a good section of Thousand-Miler (great book if you are interested in the IAT) enjoying the view and snacking.  One guy passed with a large hydration bag that definitely had the look of someone on a long walk, but he had no gear, so I figured that he was just out for a walk.Glad to see that my bike was still at Casco Jct, and I had plenty of time to ride back and still get to school to help with the running club.   Well, about 4 miles from Kewaunee I saw that hiker with the hydration bag, so I slowed down and chatted a bit.  He was such a nice friendly guy that I walked my bike about 2 miles while talking.  Seems he retired a few years ago, bought an RV and visited over 400 National Parks & Monuments. He thought where were about 490 total.  He got bored with that and looked for the next great adventure the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, since he is from Wisconsin.  He has friends and family within 60 miles of most of the trail, so is staying with them, then dropping off is car and getting a shuttle to another spot on the trail.  I hope I cross paths with him on the trail again.","Casco Junction
