Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589262,"I caught a ride from Delaware with my brother Paul, who will be hiking with me for a few days, and my sister-in-law Jan, who will be meeting us when she can where the AT crosses roads.The drive took us from the flatlands of Delaware and Maryland, through rolling hills in West Virginia and northern Virginia, and finally along what you could call really big hills or very small mountains. Pretty drive.We drove through Virginia on I-81, which must parallel the AT because we kept passing by towns that I’m planning to send re-supply boxes to. We saw a big forest fire near Montebello that looks like might be affecting the AT. I weighed my bag this morning with a week’s worth of fuel and 3 days of food but no water and it was 17 pounds, so I’m guessing my base weight is around 14 pounds. Very happy with that. Paul says his pack with water and 5 days of food was 29 pounds. Ugh!We stayed in Abingdon because it’s about 12 miles away from our starting point of Damascus. We checked into the hotel and then went for dinner. I chose this place called the Bone Fire Smokehouse after quickly glancing at Yelp and it turned out to be a lucky choice! They had a bluegrass band of young guys from Asheville, NC with an acoustic guitar, fiddle, mandolin, banjo and stand-up bass. The fiddle player had a long ZZ Top beard and it seemed like he had to bow across his beard when he was playing. The restaurant had all kinds and meat and 5 kinds of BBQ sauce, which isn’t my thing, so I ordered sides. Collard greens, pinto beans, broccoli salad, cornbread fritters and fried green tomatoes. Yum! Also had a honey cream ale from a brewery in Abingdon called Wolf Creek. Great food and music!",,"Abingdon, VA","May 04, Fri",0
Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589267,"We had breakfast at the hotel and headed to the tiny town of Damascus, “the friendliest town on the trail”. The AT goes right through the town and I made Jan pull over when I saw a white blaze. She couldn’t figure out what I was talking about - she thought at first I meant the white Trail Days festival banner hanging across the street, then she thought I meant a white traffic sign, and then I showed here the rectangle painted on a telephone pole. She said “It’s so small!” and then, “I’m gonna take picture!” I wonder if it might be the beginning of white blaze fever for Jan?It’s so great having Paul to hike with, because first of all I would have headed off to Tennessee and not north, and also I’m not scared of bears the whole time.We started our first ascent out of town. We had had some pretty dire forecasts of thunderstorms for today but although we heard thunder fairly often, we only got sprinkled on a few times. The trees are leafing out, but there isn’t enough canopy for protection from the sun so I was glad we had cloud cover.After about 5 miles, we descended to a road crossing where we were supposed to meet Jan. She had a hard time finding us. She had the exact GPS coordinates but I guess she was expecting a trailhead sign with a parking lot, and although there was a small AT sign, you could easily pass it and not be aware that the AT crosses there. As she said, “I’m a city girl!” We had lunch in the car during the only real downpour of the day.For the next few miles, the AT runs along right next to the Virginia Creeper Trail which is a rail-to-trail bike trail. There were tons of people out biking and I was a little jealous of how flat their trail was and also how little they had to carry on their backs.We ran into a Ridge Runner (the Appalachian Trail Conference hires a few dozen each season to constantly hike back and forth across sections of trail to check on hikers and conditions). We also ran across several section hikers and a few thru-hikers. We talked to one thru-hiker who started in Georgia March 10 about what a rough spring the thru-hikers have had - snow, ice and cold. There was a family hiking the opposite direction with the parents and 6 kids, the oldest of which might have been 12. The kids were all well coached on trail manners - they each greeted me and wished me a good hike. Paul and I were both glad they were hiking the opposite direction because otherwise they probably would have passed us so we were spared that humiliation.One of the thru-hikers asked Paul how he was doing and Paul said it’s not as easy as it looks in the YouTube videos, which made the other guy laugh. Paul also is commenting on every uphill, but I sort of don’t notice. Partly because since my last section hike on the AT in 2012, I’ve done long hikes in the Sierra Nevadas, the Himalayas, and the Pyrenees, which have higher ascents. But I think it’s more that I’ve done enough long distance hiking that I’m mentally and physically accustomed to long long hours of doing something hard and miserable. And even though the AT doesn’t have as much elevation gain as some trails, you are always going up or down, just many times a day.Anyway, the afternoon was a long ascent with lots of switchbacks. I thought Paul would be excited when we got a sign that said Saunders Shelter was in a quarter mile, but he just said in his usual deadpan way “I thought you were going to say you want to go to the next shelter” (6 miles away, also on the sign). That’s how I knew he was really OK.We got to the shelter but set up our tents on nice pine needle carpets. I usually prefer my tent over the cramped shelter with all the mice and snoring.One man complimented my bright gaiters and I said since you look at your feet a lot, you might as well have something that cheers you up. Another hiker (who also has Dirty Girl gaiters) said some people like to get them with the pictures of French fries and pizza. We both agreed that this is a mistake.After we set up our tents, we got water (spring a quarter mile away *sigh*), and made dinner. Paul hung our food bags from a tree in a nifty PCT bear hang that I have to have him teach me.I was all settled in my tent when the wind started to pick up and the thunder got closer. We had a terrific stormy downpour for about 20 minutes but Paul says his new tent did fine.It ended up that there are 4 guys in the shelter and 2 other people tenting here - a mix of section hikers and weekenders. I just heard allthis banging and commotion from the shelter - I guess the mice have made an appearance!Now for Paul’s take on the first day of hiking:5/5/2018 From: 469.9 Damascus, VA to 479.6 Saunders Shelter
For a first day on the trail, this was different than I was expecting.  I think I wasn’t too surprised by the ups and downs but the rock obstacles on the trail were somewhat unexpected.   I had heard comments in a number of the AT vlogs that people don’t tend to film the tougher terrain (preferring to video on the flat smooth sections) because you really have to concentrate to avoid tripping on rocks and roots.  I appreciate that better now.  I was down in my sleeping bag at about 1900, but didn’t get to sleep for another three hours.   I was totally OK with that.  Nice to just relax and watch/listen to the thunder storm roll in.","Damascus, VA
",Saunders Shelter,"May 05, Sat",9.30
Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589626,"6:00 am coyote wake-up call - they must have just killed something or were fighting. What a racket!At breakfast, one older section hiker announced he had left his breakfast in Damascus, and asked if anyone had any extra food. The weekenders gave him cherry Pop tarts, a freeze-dried dinner, two gallon ziplocks of Cheerios, and a packet of tuna. Score!We had lunch at Lost Mountain Shelter. Then we trucked it through cow pasture in the rain to meet up with Jan at a road crossing. We turned on the heat and waited out a shower.We didn’t have good options for shelters - either 6 miles or 18 miles. I had previously decided we should camp on Whitetop Mountain because there were campsites and a spring there. The walk up was rainy and windy and I was really cold. When we got to the spring, we starting setting up our tents but my hands were too cold. I put on all the clothes I had and felt much better. Two hikers came to the spring and said there were campsites across a parking lot, so we followed them. The sites they showed us were better sheltered from the wind but it is really cold. I am emptying stuff sacks to put on my hands and feet. I made a hot water bottle using a Smart Water bottle - it kinda deformed but didn’t melt.Again here is Paul’s notes:5/6/2018 To: 491.9 Whitetop Mt. Rd. Campsite
Looking at the trail guide this looked like a fairly benign morning but by the time we got to the shelter for lunch I was pretty tired.  Not much interest in eating anything, but I knew I needed to eat something.  Probably the previous day was catching up with me as well.
We crossed a pasture with some rather large beef cattle munching on grass. They weren’t much interested in us, but I still tip-toed past them.  Well maybe, tip-toeing around the cow pies too.  These were Costco-size cow pies.
Jan met us in the early afternoon at a road crossing just as the rain started to dump.  We got a 15 minute break or so, but had more miles to do, so back into the rain.  At least we had some cover from the woods.
The afternoon with a long uphill at the end of the day (in the rain) that made it that much tougher.  I was pretty beat in the afternoon – sort of getting to the point of being “stupid tired”.   I was mentally counting out hiking stick stabs to keep moving; 27, 28, 29, what comes after 29, oh 40, I’m good, 41, 42, 43…  I can understand how people get to a place of making mistakes.
We were in the clouds at Buzzards Rock.  Probably would have been the best view of the trip, but at least we got a couple of minutes to look under the clouds and see the valley.
We made it to Whitetop Mt. and found two campsites next to the spring.  After setting up out tents, Judy thought it would be best to move.  A couple of other hikers came down to use the spring and told us that there was a campground just up the road.  Maybe that is what Judy had in mind.  It was a good move since the campground was less exposed and the wind during the night was fairly strong.  The weather cleared enough for us to set up again and make dinner.","Saunders Shelter
",Whitetop Mountain,"May 06, Sun",12.30
Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589625,"Wow really cold! I don’t have a thermometer and haven’t had reception to check the weather, but I’m guessing that it was upper 30s.My hot water bottle did not work so well - the top came unscrewed and dumped water on me. I don’t really have the gear for this weather - I have a summer quilt that’s rated to 40 degrees and only comes up to my shoulders. The thing that made sleep possible wasI put my poncho over my head and shoulders. Finally got to sleep and woke up to sunshine at 7:15.In the morning, two hikers coming up said there was a treat at the next road crossing, which I took to mean there was trail magic!It was unbelievable - über trail magic. It was put on by three couples who were friend with one of them who had hiked the AT in 2014. They had chicken salad sandwiches, pasta salad, green salad with toppings, orange juice, beer, chocolate milk, apples, oranges, bananas, strawberries, and lots more. Then they had stuff for hikers to take - tea, coffee, and drink mix packets, ziplocks, Payday bars (which don’t melt like other candy bars), Oreos, Wet Wipes, and entire backpacking meals.It was really welcome, but I feel kind of bad that these people spent thousands of dollars to give free food to hikers that aren’t really people in need. But for all I know, maybe they do stuff for people who really need it.We saw some of the wild ponies that this area is known for. When we got to the Thomas Knob Shelter, there were ponies just expectantly waiting for us. I thought they were looking for snacks, and one ran up to Paul after he took his phone out of a ziplock, but turns out they just wanted to lick sweat off us. They really went to town.We had foresty walking with flowers in the understory but also meadows with vistas. The trail near Mount Rogers was super rocky and required some scrambling. As another hiker said, “What sadistic person made this Trail?”We heard thunder throughout the late afternoon and then finally there was lightning and big rain drops. But we made it to the shelter before the storm!Tenting is not allowed in the Grayson Highlands State Park so there are 7 of us in this 8 person shelter. If there were 8, we would be squished like sardines, but it isn’t so bad.Here’s what Paul had to say:5/7/2018 To: 503.6 Wise Shelter
This was a pretty eventful day.  After a 2+ hour hike to Elk Garden where the AT crosses VA 600, we walked out of the woods into a pretty spectacular Trail Magic.  I had a great chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, Utz cheese puffs, and an orange juice - although they were offering beer.  (I later found out that someone had already taken them up on that at 0930.)  It was really great to sit in a chair and catch a break.
On the way up to Thomas Knob shelter, we saw some wild ponies off in distance in some really nice open fields.  Approaching Thomas Knob shelter, I heard a number of human voices laughing – I figured there must be some ponies at the shelter.  Sure enough, there were four ponies right at the shelter including a mare with her new foal.  The mare kept her distance which we respected.  We sat on the edge of the shelter and the other two ponies came up to us and licked the salt perspiration off our arms and legs.  It was pretty much unavoidable.  I guess they figured we were mobile salt licks.  After getting some more water at the spring by the shelter we moved on.  Pretty much impossible to eat lunch at the shelter, so it was good we had something at the trail magic earlier.
The afternoon was pretty tough with a lot of rocks to climb and maneuver around.  Some pretty tough trail and it was hard to make distance at times.  We were somewhat exposed and the occasional thunder in the background was enough motivation to keep moving to get back undercover. 
We made it to Wise Shelter and we were number 6 and 7 into an 8 person shelter.  I was nervous about the prospects of getting into the shelter given the time of day and given that there is no camping in the Grayson Highlands State Park.  After about a half hour of arriving the rain let loose so it was good to have a roof over our heads.  I was a little worried about staying in the shelter.  I didn’t want to be the old guy who snored all night.  I asked Judy about it in the morning.  She said “Well it was sort of a snorchestra with everyone contributing.”   I heard some of it but it wasn’t too bad.","Whitetop Mountain
",Wise Shelter,"May 07, Mon",11.70
Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589627,"Another really cold night - not the best sleeping. I was awake for a few hours in the middle of the night, shivering and listening to the snorechestra. (I snored myself awake so I can’t point fingers). But I was lying down for almost 12 hours so it’s not surprising I was awake a lot. A sunny morning. We were supposed to meet up with Jan at a place called The Scales but the road was a really rough 4WD road so we figured she wouldn’t make it. So we continued to Old Orchard Shelter for lunch. We crossed VA 603 where Jan went to try to meet up with us, but she got there after us. We finally got cell reception and got in touch with her. But I guess she was asking hikers if they had seen us because several told us they had seen her and she was looking for us. The best comment was this guy “Are you Paul? Your wife says hi”.Several thru-hikers have been here - some just for dinner, some staying. There is a Finnish couple, an Indian guy, an American woman, and a few American guys. Right now the Finnish woman is giving the Indian guy his first massage. She just asked him “Do you feel like a white lady now?”What do you want to add, Paul?5/8/2017 To: 514.5 Hurricane Mt. Shelter
We hiked out of Wise Shelter in the morning and I got a wiff of a cell phone signal.  I called Jan and she offered to meet us at The Scales (a corral area that I heard was supposed to be a nice area to camp).  Apparently people use this area to car camping as well.  On the way up to The Scales, we walked through a cattle grazing area.  Judy stopped up ahead and commented about the steer with horns – you know the type of horns that Texans put on the front of their Cadillacs.  Judy said “Do you see the cow up ahead with the horns?”  I said, “No, I see the three cows with horns.  Look to your right.”  Judy is such a polite hiker.  She offered to let me go first.
I had learned a few of the hiker etiquette rules; hikers going uphill have the right of way, slower hikers give way to faster hikers.  Apparently, there is another one – the older brother gets to walk past the steer with Cadillac horns first.  One crossed the path in front of me.  I waited until he passed.  Good thing they were pretty mellow.
We made it to The Scales, but no Jan.  I looked for the road expecting to see a paved country road but all that was there was a rutted one-lane Forest Service road.  We waited a while for Jan, but figured (hoped) that she realized the road was going to be tough passage.  No cell signal, so tough to communicate.   I spent the next several hours worried that Jan was upside down in a ditch off that road.  I got a text late in the afternoon (which I didn’t realize until later) saying Jan would meet us at another location (Fox Creek) around 1500.  Unfortunately, the trail had been pretty good and we went through there about 1415.
Jan got to meet a lot of thru hikers at Fox Creek and was asking whether they had seen us.  After we got to Hurricane Mt. Shelter, there was a parade of thru hikers coming in passing the message that Jan had been looking for us.  I finally had a good cell signal at the shelter and texted Jan, but she was in a location where she couldn’t receive, so it wasn’t until she went back to town that we were able to communicate back and forth.  Jan also got to meet the legendary Trail Angel Miss Janet.
One of my concerns that I would get the trail name “Silver Alert”.  I came close I think.","Wise Shelter
",Hurricane Mountain Shelter,"May 08, Tue",10.90
Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589934,"Not quite as cold last night. Woke up to a view of the sunrise from the shelter. The thru-hikers were all psyched to go to Partnership Shelter which is near the Mount Rogers visitor center that has a phone to call a pizza joint that will deliver to the shelter. That shelter is 20 miles away which is beyond my ability.A sunny morning walk to Dickey Gap. Right before the gap, “Daypack” was re-stocking coolers with Trail Magic. He was a 70-ish guy who has thru-hiked the AT four times and plans to do his fifth and final thru-hike next year.We got to the parking lot before Jan and we were talking to a woman in a van who, like so many people, had talked to Jan yesterday. She asked the normal questions like “Are you thru-hiking? How far are you going?” When I said I was going to Waynesboro, she asked if I had a phone so she could give me her number. I asked her what her name was and she said “Miss Janet”. Paul and I were awestruck - Miss Janet is a legendary Trail Angel. She gave me her number so if I ever needed help I can call her.Jan drove up - yay! Turns out we passed the Fox Creek parking lot at 2:15 pm yesterday and she got there at 2:30 and waited for us until 7. She had funny stories about what she learned about AT hikers. For example, someone had left a bag of Trail Magic hanging from the trailhead sign. Since hikers try to avoid taking off their backpacks whenever possible, a young woman hiker asked Jan to stuff the things from the Trail Magic into her backpack for her. And one hiker peeled the clementine Jan gave him and asked her to take the peel (hikers love getting rid of their trash at every opportunity). She said she walked up to a hiker to give him a clementine and had to take a step back because of the hiker stink.I was trying to find a campground where we could take showers and Jan already knew where it was. I asked the campground host about showers and he had to go with us to the self-pay station to find out how much it was ($2). Then he said to put the payment in an envelope and slip it in the slot. Then he walked away - didn’t seem much to care if we paid the proper fees or not. But he did come back to tell me how to rig the women’s shower to stay on longer. Even though I had to put my dirty clothes back on, the shower felt good.Miss Janet had suggested the town of Marion for lunch, and Jan knew just where to go. She was a fountain of knowledge about the area like how Hungry Mother State Park got its name (sad story that ends people finding the mother starved to death by a creek and the child next to her saying “Hungry, Mother”.We went to Subway for lunch and then we drove back to the AT. Paul gave me some stuff like his bear bag kit, K2 tape, and pita bread (my tortillas had gotten moldy). He helped me back-flush my filter because the water source at Wise Shelter was just a algae leaf-sludge puddle and my filter was all gunked up. It was so great having Paul as a hiking partner and Jan as our personal Trail Angel.After a 4 mile walk on a sunny afternoon, I got to Trimpi Shelter before 4 pm. It seemed like a shame not to walk further but after sitting and chatting with Jeremy (he is a section hiker from Albany, NY) who started the same day from Damascus), I got too lazy to move on. We were joined later by three thru-hikers and two women who are out for a couple days. One of the thru-hikers has a black T-shirt with a swirly pattern made by the salt from his sweat. He has a hickey on his arm from an over enthusiastic pony.I tried to hang my food bag myself but just am a terrible thrower. Jeremy helped with the throwing and I did manage to get it in the PCT hang Paul showed me. I was so proud I took a picture. Last time I took a picture of a “great” food bag hang, a bear took all my food so I hope I have better luck this time.We are all tenting (or hammocking) since the weather is nice.Here are Paul’s final notes on his final day:5/9/2017 To: 519.6 Dickey Gap (AT crosses VA 650)
Finishing out with a 5 mile hike to Dickey Gap.  Trail was pretty good and I think knowing that I was nearing the end was a bit of a boost.  I kept worrying that maybe the hikers wouldn’t end up at the same location as Jan for a pick-up.  We would have been SOL since there was zero cell signal.  Ten minutes after we arrived at Dickey Gap, Jan showed up and we got showers and lunch.  I had been craving a fountain Coke, even though I hardly drink much soda anymore.  We drove Judy back to the trail and hung around for a few minutes in case she had remembered something that she left behind.  In matter of seconds she was gone into the woods.  It was great to hike with Judy.  She just goes and doesn’t stop much for breaks even on the tough uphills.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589935,"My food was there in the morning!I decided to do a big push today because I have a resupply/laundry day tomorrow. Instead of getting in late in the day and rushing around, I can get my stuff done and then have time to relax. The place I want to stay has a hot tub, so I definitely want time for that!I made good time in the morning - nice weather and trail. When I would start to lose focus, I would walk to the mantra of HOT-TUB HOT-TUB. Lots of hikers on the trail rushing to Partnership Shelter to get the shuttle to Marion for re-supply.I arrived at Partnership Shelter and asked where the water was. Usually it’s a spring or creak but was told there was a sink behind the shelter. I wasn’t sure whether or not they were pulling my leg but there actually was a sink with running water. There is also a shower (cold) and a second story. I had lunch and continued on. I lost steam in the afternoon but knew I had enough time. The trail was too rocky for me to use my mantra.Every so often a thunderstorm would threaten, and then either rain a few drops or dissipate. When I was a quarter mile from the shelter, there was thunder and lightning, and when I spotted the shelter the storm really hit. I rock hopped across the stream and ran up to the shelter. There were three guys in the shelter and I told them I was just a little too late! Then the storm picked up even more, and hail started. So maybe my timing wasn’t so bad after all. Then we had blue skies again in about 20 minutes.I hardly saw hikers in the afternoon and was thinking I would have the shelter to myself. I’m glad I’m not - too creepy. Here in the shelter with section hiker Tortoise, who was in the Saunders Shelter my first night (he asked how Paul liked his hike), and 3 thru-hikers Steady, Boxcar, and a third guy who just showed up a short while ago. This third hiker said he had literally no camping experience before the AT. His first night he saw a food bag hanging from a tree and didn’t know what it was. He is averaging about 25 miles per day so he has really found his metier. We have a really loud stream in front of the shelter - I love falling asleep to the sound a water.","Trimpi Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589962,"AT lingo lesson: when a hiker has a rest day and does zero miles on the AT, it’s called “taking a zero”. When a hiker does less than 5 miles, it’s a “near zero” so it’s called “taking a nero”. So I took a nero today. 
As I did my short morning walk, the bird song was gradually drowned out by the siren call of I-81. I picked up my maildrop from The Barn restaurant and had breakfast there. Boxcar was there and has some calf issues. The Finnish couple were there too and narrowly missed the rain last evening by hiding out in this old schoolhouse that is now a museum. 
Then I walked up the road and just as I was turning into the driveway of the farm, this guy pulls up and asked if I just got off the AT. It turns out it was Jeremy’s dad and there is a problem with Jeremy’s anti-seizure medication, and they haven’t been able to get in touch with him. I went with the dad to show him where the trail markers are where he could leave a note and made some suggestions where they might be able to find him. Yikes!
I waited with an orange tabby at the farmhouse until Ken showed up. Then a leisurely afternoon of showering, doing laundry and re-packing my stuff. In addition to alpacas, there are hens, 2 cats and 2 dogs. I had set my tent up with the rain fly up but then a thunderstorm passed over and I had to get it in place again. 
Cindy, my hostess, drove me a quarter mile to a Mexican restaurant. Miss Janet was there with a Filipino guy that I heard she is slack-packing all the way to Maine. She remembered me from the other day. 
I went to the Relax Inn to put some of my extra food in the hiker box. I have PB&J for my lunches but couldn’t find tortillas/bread at either of the two gas stations here. Found a pack of whole wheat tortillas in the hiker box! I saw Boxcar there and he is taking a couple zeros (see lingo lesson above) in the hope of letting his calf heal  
The hot tub is covered and at this point, I’m so happy to be clean and wearing clean clothes I don’t even care. And to think the hot tub was what I was dreaming about on those chilly nights!In my tent listening to the drone of the interstate. Kind of like a mountain stream?","Chatfield Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590465,"I walked down to the Sunoco to pick up the trail and get a canned Starbucks drink. My bag was SO heavy. I sadly decided to lighten the load by sacrificing my favorite Whole Foods cranberry trail mix and my favorite Trader Joe’s sesame covered almonds. I left them on a bench outside the gas station so maybe a hiker would take them.A short walk under I-81 and back into the woods. I came upon a clearing with a privy and a picnic table that Steady was sitting at. Looking more closely, I could see the site formerly had a shelter. Steady had spent the night camped there and since there was LTE phone service, he sat at the picnic table, watching videos and eating Frosted Flakes out of the bag. See, even on the AT you can be a couch potato!Shortly before lunch, I passed a sign marking the end of the first quarter of the trail for the north-bound thru-hikers.The afternoon was really hot. A lot of cow pasture and stiles. I didn’t see many hikers and was surprised to see no day-hikers at all on a Saturday. I guess the Mt. Rogers/Grayson Highlands area we just passed is more popular for that.I just got slower and slower with the heat. Finally made it to the shelter at 7 pm and didn’t get dinner and chores done until after 9. There are 2 other hikers in the shelter with me, another one tenting, and Steady had hung his hammock.

I checked the weather and it said the high was 82 degrees but it felt much hotter.I found a nice deep creek and spent some time wading - so great especially as I’ve developed a heat rash on my ankles and calves. I ate my lunch as my feet dried.Then it was a 2,000 foot climb over 4.7 miles. I kept stopping in every spot of shade to rest. About half way up, I just lay in the middle of the trail. What am I going to do when it’s really hot?1.8 miles before the Shelter was a spring-fed pond. I stopped there and filtered some water - cold and delicious! I also dumped some on my head. It gave me enough relief to make to the shelter (at 4:40 pm - my easy walk took all day!)The shelter is a former fire warden’s cabin made of stone with a field in front where I set up my tent. A great view of the valley below which is some kind of unusual limestone sinkhole.When I got out of the shelter last night, the stars were so bright but my view was obscured by trees. I figured I would roll back my rain fly here for good star viewing, but wouldn’t you know it, the temp really dropped after the sun went down.

The morning walk was along that ridge.Around the middle of the day, I crossed a road. The local hiking club had left a nice big bear-proof trashcan for hikers. I had to read the instructions carefully to open and close it, but was glad to get rid of my trash. Next to the trash can was a large bin with a note for north-bound hikers to please take a bag of wood shavings to this shelter (Jenkins) for the mouldering privy. (You throw in a handful to “flush”.) I opened the bin - full of trash. People can be such pigs.Ten miles along that road is a general store run by an Amish family. A group from the previous shelter called the store and they sent a horse and buggy to pick them up ($5), brought them to the store, sold them burgers, fries, and ice cream, and buggied them back to the trail.The afternoon was long and I was moving slow. My feet are really hurting from moving slow - kinda like having a job where you stand all day. Hoping to have a better pace tomorrow.The conversations today are about Trail Days, a festival for AT hikers that is in Damascus, VA this weekend. Hikers are trying to figure out how to hitchhike or get shuttles and how to meet up with other hikers up and down the trail. I heard this funny idea where people who have the same trail name will have to cage-fight or mud-wrestle for the name. For example, there are two Aladdins, two Rockys, and four Jukeboxes.There is another female section hiker close to my age named Dreamcatcher, and two middle-aged thru-hikers named Hills and Tab. They’re moving more at my speed - 10-15 miles per day - so maybe I’ll get to see them for a while.It’s actually warm here and this may be the first night I don’t bundle up.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590661,"Woke up to overcast skies - yay! The trail today was easy walking - actually a dirt path. The trees are starting to leaf out enough that there was shade even when the sun came out mid-morning. A guy walking southbound chatting on his phone gave a little shriek as he almost ran into me. He said about 25 minutes away he had seen a cub so mama was probably prowling around. Then as he walked away he said into the phone, “Jeez, there are a lot of hikers”.I am super scared of bears but I figured the bears would have probably moved on by then. I know at other times I would have spent the rest of the day yelling, clacking my trekking poles, and nervously scanning for bears. I remembered this hospital where I worked in Tacoma had a banner with an outline of Mt. Ranier that said “Live Like the Mountain is Out”. So I decided to “Hike Like Mama Bear Isn’t There”.The trail went through a burned section that still smelled smoky. I really wonder if it might be from the same fire as we saw driving down I-81 to Damascus. Everyone was moving fast to make it to a new general store called the Brushy Mountain Outpost right on the AT. I made the 11.3 miles in 5 hours 30 minutes which is fast for me. I had a veggie burger, fries, and sweet tea and was so stuffed I was going really slow to the shelter. It looked like it would storm soon so I got busy staking out my tent. The storm hit and I dived in and finished setting up my tent from the inside. I just rested until the rain stopped and went over to the shelter - and saw the funniest thing. The hikers were sitting along the back of the shelter watching “My Cousin Vinny” from a phone projected on a screen made from a tyvek ground cloth stretched between two trekking poles. I watched for a while, but I knew the water source was a stream a quarter mile down hill. So I went to get water so I could be back in time for the part where the Marisa Tomei character testifies. After such a big lunch, I just had snacks and tea for dinner, then got settled in for the night. Now there is really heavy rain but I’m all cozy in my tent.","Jenkins Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590920,"There was no rain as I was eating breakfast and packing up. Shortly after I started walking, the rain started and never really stopped. A misty, verdant and wet hike. At times it was ridiculous and the trail became a brook. There was just no stopping and there was no way really of how much ground I was covering. Finally came to the road the hostel was on and knew it was 0.8 miles from the AT. I don’t think I would have found it but fortunately Hills saw me and yelled at me from out the window of the hostel. Almost 6 hours of nonstop hiking.Lickskillet Hostel is a great name - like the hikers are so hungry they lick the skillet clean. But actually it’s named that because it’s located in Lickskillet Hollow. The host Mungo is super nice, and it’s donation based. But it’s a little funky. The main hostel is in an old church and has beds, a pool table, a TV, and kitchen area with fridge and a hot plate. But no running water. There is a porta-potty and then a wood shed with a dirt floor that has the shower and washing machine.When I first got here, there was only Hills and TAB, but now there’s over a dozen hikers and some will have to sleep on the floor (I think hikers can handle it). I thought I would get hypothermia when I stopped walking but I really was OK. Just changed into dry clothes and wandered around in a stupor, wolfing down BBQ potato chips and red Twizzlers and looking out at the rain. Then made last night’s dinner and some mashed potatoes I found. When the rain stopped and I showered and did laundry. The washer was an odd semiautomatic thing where you opened the line to fill it, set the timer for agitation, then let it drain into the dirt floor. Then you transferred to a spinner. Then to the hostel for the dryer, which was pretty normal except for the exhaust coil that is haphazardly sticking out a window.I sorted through my resupply box and mended my shorts (seams coming apart). I ate again and got into a real bed. Not only that, I have an outlet and WiFi! The rain will lessen and then just come in buckets.","Helveys Mill Shelter

The closest spots moving in our direction were in Missouri. About an hour into my hike - downpour! It was heavy but after about an hour it cleared up and it was the only significant rain of the day.The trail was slop today - muck and puddles, sometimes an actual stream. It was like an obstacle course, in a fun way. I was either in a dense forest with really tall trees or in rhododendron tunnels.About 10:30, I came to a swinging pedestrian bridge over the Kimberling Creek. It was my chance to put my pack down somewhere not muddy. I discovered I had put today’s snacks in my giveaway pile - so sad. But I had my PB&J sitting on the bridge steps. Later I took advantage of a small footbridge to put my pack down and filter water.Right before the Wapiti Shelter where I planned to spend the night, the trail spilled me from the forest onto an open area with a pond. I looked across and thought it might be a campground but it was just Steady with his hammock and crap everywhere. He said he had been to the shelter but thought this pond would be a great place to camp and watch the thunderstorm (some dark clouds just then).I went up to the shelter but the shelter itself was one of the older types that are really low to the ground. A little forlorn. There were nice camping spots nearby but I figured if I was going to tent, the pond might be better.The weather stayed nice while I got set up. There were literally dozens of bees on my pack, sucking the sweat from the straps.A thru-hiker named Chance It showed up to camp here. He got a smoky fire going to help with the bugs and to cook his dinner. I asked him how he learned to make a fire because I’ve tried and it’s not that intuitive, and everything out here is wet. Chance said he can’t remember, he’s just always known. He’s from near Cincinnati and has a cabin with a wood burning stove. He said he never realized there were people who COULDN’T make fires until he got on the AT and would see things like the wrong kind of wood piled up next to the fire pit. He had a piece of pine with pine tar on it that he used as a natural accelerant.I finished dinner and hung my food bag. I threw the rope myself! It’s kinda bad - the bag is too close to the trunk and not that high, but I did it.When I settled into my tent, we heard thunder. There have been a couple more peals since then - maybe further away? I hear lots of crickets and some frogs from the pond, and there is one owl who keeps hooting but gets no response.","Lickskillet Hostel, Bland, VA

All in all, a great day to do only a half day’s hike.I got to Wood Hole Hostel at noon. It is the oldest hostel on the AT and is now run by the granddaughter of the original owner. There is daily free yoga, nightly communal dinners with produce from the organic garden, and both the hostess and her husband are massage therapists - but they were at Trail Days so none of that was happening.I was met at the door by Purple Penguin, who was going to hike today. Instead, she ended up rescuing Pappy, an 87-year old thru-hiker, from the trail. (He is a Triple Crowner, meaning he has done the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail. This is his second thru-hike of the AT). He was setting up his tent last night and had his stuff spread out when a storm hit. His sleeping bag and all his stuff got wet and he shivered all night. He was walking back and forth across the road hoping someone would drive by and find him.Three Socks is a section hiker who was filling in as “innkeeper”. I was freezing and glad to make it here. I took a hot shower and they had loaner clothes. Three Socks did my laundry, and since I had the loaner clothes I could have my hiking clothes AND camp clothes cleaned. Before this, I would wear my camp clothes while my stinky hiking clothes were being washed but the camp clothes were getting funky.I bought some homemade bread and some cheese while I waited for my laundry. The weather outside was wild and the branches were waving like crazy in the wind. I had arranged to meet Dreamcatcher here but didn’t know if she would make the 16 miles today in this weather, but she made it with Peppermint and Achilles at 4 pm.Hikers are supposed to cook outside so I cooked dinner on my stove while holding an umbrella.While Dreamcatcher and I were eating dinner in the bunkhouse, a hiker with a backpack walked in and we both said, “You're so dry!” It was Mick who had just driven up from Huntsville, Alabama for a week-long hike.I’m wearing my camp clothes with the loaner clothes on top.

We could see a little patch of blue sky. Then we had a fabulous breakfast made by Neville and Blue, with Achilles and Three Socks.By the time we started walking, the skies looked clear, and later there was sun. The trail was pretty good except for some mucky bits. Right before the town, which I could see it way below, there was a brief thunderstorm, but the weather didn’t get cold and windy like yesterday.I had told Dreamcatcher that she could share the room I reserved at the Plaza motel because I thought it was a double. When I got close to town, I got a text from Dreamcatcher that all the rooms at the motel were full except for mine, which only had one bed. She ended up at the Angels Rest Hostel.The motel is full of hikers and a little bit of a dive, but I am loving it. My very own flush toilet!

I took a water break and got water that was just running down a side trail. There was water everywhere (remember this for later). Dreamcatcher caught up to me right before the Rice Field Shelter. We had agreed to camp at the Symms Gap Meadow, which the AT Companion listed as a campsite with a water source. I mentioned that the Guthook app didn’t indicate there was water there, but we talked about it and since there was water EVERYWHERE we should be fine. I had lunch in the shade of the Rice Field Shelter and Dreamcatcher passed me right after. A short while later I ran into Hills and Workhorse who were slackpacking south back to Pearisburg. They had seen Dreamcatcher right after she saw a mama bear and two cubs.The tree canopy has closed in and the underbrush is so high, when I see hikers coming toward me I can’t see their legs. They look like they are floating on a sea of green. I figured I would get to the campsite at 3:30, and it was at the bottom of a descent. Right about 3:30, something didn’t seem right, so I checked the app and it said I was 0.1 mi past the site (the app uses GPS so I can use it even when I have no cell phone signal). I went back and followed a side trail, and looked around, but no campsites and no water. There a Porta-Potty and a taped off area so what I think now is that someone is developing that land and it’s now off-limits to hikers.Anyway, I went to the next listed campsite, and the next few. The hike from the shelter was on a ridge, and since water flows down, there was no water to be had anywhere. I got a text from Dreamcatcher that she must have missed Symm’s Gap was headed for the next shelter, where there is water. At 5 pm I was almost 6 miles from the shelter and didn’t think I would make it before dark, and was tired from the long day and the heat.I went to the next campsite and got settled in. I was stressed about my water situation and a little despondent about camping alone. I had a little bit of drinking water, but not enough to cook dinner. I also didn’t want to eat since digestion uses up so much water. I wanted to get my food bag hung but as I was pulling it out of my backpack, the bottom seam ripped (I think it was weakened by hanging in the rain). I did a lame duct tape repair, and then a lame hang. Then onto setting up the tent. As I was driving the final stakes in, I saw 2 strong able thru-hikers came down the trail and I put on a brave face and casually waved to them. Then they decided to camp here! I told them I get scared camping by myself which they thought was funny. (I was dead serious.) They are Lone Wolf and Eva. I told Eva that we have to be rebels together since we use our real names, and not Trail names.And since I got in my tent, another guy came to camp!

Got out of camp at 6:35 am - much faster when you don’t eat breakfast. I came to water about an hour and a half later. I filtered some to drink right then. I didn’t feel all that thirsty, but as soon as I drank water, I was really hungry. I kept filtering for my Camelback and for water to make breakfast. The place where I got water was muddy and not that nice, so I continued to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, which had a picnic table, and had breakfast there.I wasn’t sure how far I wanted to go, but I wanted to go to the Bailey Gap Shelter and have lunch, then decide. It was SO muggy even after a light shower. Dreamcatcher was at the shelter when I got there, planning to spend the night. It started raining really hard and thundering, so I decided to stay put.I got the whole story from Dreamcatcher about the mama bear and two cubs from yesterday. The guy I thought was Workhorse was actually a guy who was walking south. Dreamcatcher saw the mama bear blocking the trail and the cubs were beside her. Dreamcatcher was clacking her poles and calling but the mama bear stayed put. Then that guy was trucking south and almost ran right into the bear and took off running on the opposite direction. Then mama decided to move on.The afternoon was a little boring just sitting in the shelter. I did a great mending job on my food bag with dental floss and Tenacious Tape. Around 3 pm, I made dinner just for something to do.The main entertainment has been all the hikers stopping by. About 3 dozen hikers have been through, and after a break they keep pushing on. Two foreign hikers - not sure what European nationalities - stopped to make dinner before getting some more miles in. They were speaking English to each other and I wasn’t sure if it was their common language or if they were doing it just for fun. One was saying that “8 ounces is one quarter liter”. Grim, from Yorkshire, was giving them a hard time for being so precise. Grim started at Springer Mountain in Georgia and is going as far as he can on a three-month visa. He seems to have American hiker cooking down - dump some boiling water right into the package of Knorr’s sides, wait a bit, and eat it right out of the package.I was all settled in for the night at 5:50 pm, listening to my audiobook.

They weren’t even talking quietly - one was lying down in the shelter and the other was standing outside. And they spend all dang day together - they can’t talk then?The mice were gnawing at something last night, but stayed away from my stuff. I had to put on my wet cold grimy clothes from yesterday- yuck. The two southbounders said there were two streams to ford within the first quarter mile of the trail and to keep camp shoes on for that part. I was a little nervous about going on my own so I waited until Hills was ready to go. He had no problems hopping across the rocks in his trail shoes, but he’s 6’5”. I did walk through the water in my flip flops - it was just easier but the water wasn’t too deep. After the second crossing, I gave Hills the thumbs up, and he keep going while I put my trail runners on.I was pretty grumpy all morning. I was so soggy and filthy I could hardly stand to be in my own skin. The trail was slippery and I had two bad falls. Bug bites everywhere! And it looked like it would rain any minute.While I was having my PB&J, two older German guys stopped to talk (actually only one speaks English). We leap-frogged a few times, and then I passed them at the beginning of a horrible knife’s edge ridge, and I was determined to stay ahead of them. I staggered into Niday Shelter, totally out of steam at 3:30.Before getting on the trail, I had decided to stay at Niday, and then do 17 miles to a hostel tomorrow. Dreamcatcher and I figured out a plan where we could go a few miles farther today to camp so tomorrow won’t be so long. When I got to Niday, Hills said Dreamcatcher had left 8 minutes before. I had a snack and some electrolyte drink and got ready for the final push. Catch It was making a great fire and while he was stoking it, he potted a maple sapling in a hollow log. He said Dreamcatcher had tried to talk him into camping with us and building a fire there, but his feet hurt too much. The Germans arrived (yay for me for staying ahead) and asked me if I was staying at the shelter. I explained where I was going and they packed up and started following me. Energized after my break, I was going as fast as I could so they wouldn’t pass me. And then suddenly they weren’t there - maybe they decided to go back to Niday?I made it to camp and Dreamcatcher was all set up. This is such a nice spot right next to a stream and it turned into a beautiful evening. The site is at the bottom of our next big ascent and while I ate dinner, I watched one hiker after another lope up the hill. Some hikers won’t quit until there is no daylight. We tried to start a fire with my stove fuel but just couldn’t keep it going.Dreamcatcher said it looked someone was going to join us and I asked if it looked like that someone could start a fire. It was Caroline from the UK and when she asked if she could join us, we didn’t inquire as to her fire-making ability. She is also under that three-month visa deadline. So nice to go to sleep to the sound of the stream.","Laurel Creek Shelter

There was a side trail to the Dragon’s Tooth, which was a big monolith. It was kind of neat to see. I didn’t take any pictures because I don’t think I could capture it well.The climb down was just the worst - sheer rock. It was really terrifying and awful. Sometimes I would throw my poles down, try to slide down and land on my feet without breaking an ankle. It may be fun for a day hike, but it seemed crazy for backpacking. No pictures because my phone was buried in my pack so it wouldn’t get smashed.Definitely the hardest day so far. I was mad and frustrated; I was worried about the hostel being full and kind of despondent about how bad the day turned out. Caroline was talking to a couple from VA who were really proud about the “Virginia Triple Crown” which consists of Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. Caroline was all chatty with the couple but I had to pretend to do something with my phone to avoid telling them what I thought of their stupid Triple Crown.Then I ran into a young couple who were walking up to Dragons Tooth. They asked me how it was and I said, somewhat truthfully, that it was good. Then the guy asked “How long would it take, like 30 minutes?” and I said “Are you JOKING??!!”. Then I had to backtrack a little bit and explain that it was a little harder with a backpack, etc. but that conversation could have gone better. Oh well.I made it to the hostel at 6:30 pm and Dreamcatcher had saved me a bunk. The owner had told Workhorse that he could take one of the cars to the Homeplace restaurant (keys were in the car). I changed into my camp clothes and flip-flops and got in the car with Dreamcatcher and Hills. I didn’t even shower and my feet were so dirty. The Homeplace serves food family-style. Every table gets fried chicken and can choose other meats. The waitress brings all the sides and everything is re-fillable. I ate fried chicken, ham, green beans with bacon, pinto beans with bacon, cole slaw, biscuits, mashed potatoes with gravy, chow chow and cooked spiced apples. I think I ate more than anyone at our table, and it was all stuff I normally wouldn’t eat. Lots of hikers and locals. We gave Captain a ride back to the trail from the Homeplace. Then we drove to a market and picked up Alma and Snickers (the Finnish couple) to bring them back to the hostel.The hostel is in a big shed with a central area with couches. Very sketchy. I did laundry and have it hanging inside. There is a sign on the bathroom that we’re supposed to pee outside on the grass. I took a showered, which got rid of all the dirt and sweat, but I feel like I need another shower to get rid of the funk of this place. The mattresses are so dirty so I have my sleeping pad on top of the mattress but skin keeps touching the mattress. Ick! On the plus side, even though today was really hard, I am really looking forward to getting back on the trail so I can leave this place.

Since it was the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, there were lots of day hikers and weekend backpackers. I have noticed my sense of smell is changing - either it’s more sensitive or I notice unfamiliar smells more. But I have noticed - and other AT hikers have commented the same - that when I walk past a day hiker I get hit with a blast of smells - like laundry soap, deodorant, and sunscreen. Which I guess means they are getting hit with a blast of AT hiker smell, or maybe they’re less sensitive.This young couple came up to me and the guy said “You were right about that hike”.

I just figured I’d put on bug spray and stay in the shelter with Workhorse, two guys hiking the VA Triple Crown loop, and a couple that is thru-hiking. I had gotten to sleep quite late (after 9?) when later there was all this shining of headlamps and hullabaloo. I thought the other people in the shelter were freaking out about a mouse, but they said there was a copperhead on a sleeping bag.

There was thunder far away, then closer and closer but I made it to the shelter at 1:45, still under blue skies.It grew dark suddenly and then the storm finally was upon us - really heavy downpour with lightning, and thunder that shook the shelter. A few hikers made it before the storm and a few wet ones trickled in later. Ramble made this really fancy ramen with 3 flavor packets, and the packaging was passed around the shelter as we discussed the ingredients and nutritional info. That was our entertainment - too bad the hiker with movie projector wasn’t there. The rain kind of stopped but it didn’t clear up like I was hoping.

The walk started in heavy fog and the mosquitoes were so unbelievably fierce - I put bug spray on at the shelter and then two more times as I was walking. They were biting through the repellent and multiple layers of clothing. Three hours later, the sun burned off the fog and the mosquitoes disappeared. They were driving me insane. 
About two miles into the hike, there was a sign saying that the next 90 miles are maintained by the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club. Based on what I’ve seen so far, they are doing a great job. The trail is really well groomed, blazes are plentiful and clear, and blow-downs are cleared away. I saw three groups of volunteers out doing trail maintenance. Many of the AT clubs have Memorial Day picnics that double as Trail Magic, and every time I came to a trail crossing, I would hope to see tables set up. But the good trail itself was magical. 
Also - we have started to criss cross the Blue Ridge Parkway. Where the AT crosses the road there are scenic pull outs for car - AND - (exciting for hikers) - trashcans!
So - even with lunch, a snack, and two water breaks, I was done the 17 miles by 4 pm. That’s fast for me, and I have to say it was an easy 17 miles. 
The campground has a free shuttle for AT hikers so I called the campground when I got to the road crossing. Dreamcatcher was already there and got us a cabin. By the time the shuttle came, Workhorse had popped out of the forest. The shuttle was actually a little shuttle van like rental car companies have at the airport. It had started to drizzle and there was light rain this evening. 
Tropical Storm Alberto has hit the Florida Panhandle and will be affecting the weather here in Virginia. The bunkhouse here is full (that’s why we’re here in a cabin). There are a few hikers here that ended their hikes but their flights home were cancelled. We called a hostel north of here in Glasgow, VA to see if they could pick us up off the trail tomorrow but they are already too busy with shuttles. We arranged with another shuttle service to pick us up at a road crossing and take us to the hostel in Glasgow. Not quite sure how I’m going to get the rest of the hike done but taking it one day at a time.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592439,"Change of plans - thinking things over during the night. If I did the shuttle, the logistics of trying to complete the missed section would be so complicated. I told Dreamcatcher and she decided to hike 17 miles today to a campsite near a spring. Then she would have a short hike tomorrow to where the shuttle would pick us up for Stanimals hostel. I only wanted to do the 14 miles to this shelter. And Workhorse seems happy to follow along with Dreamcatcher’s plan.We had breakfast at the campground and had to wait for breakfast serving to be done before we could get our shuttle. (The owner Susan was doing all the cooking and driving and her son was doing the register.) We didn’t get dropped off until 9 am, which I just hate. I do my best hiking in the morning and that meant today I would be doing most of my miles in the afternoon.Dreamcatcher and Workhorse went loping off into the mist. Tough day with 6000’ of climbing. Fortunately, the storms and rain held off. The weather was hot and muggy, with precipitation that was in between a heavy mist and a light drizzle. The trail was good at times, but there started to be some of the rock jumble that slows me down.I saw Dreamcatcher and Workhorse around 2 when they were finishing their lunch, and Dreamcatcher was still gung-ho on the campsite, which was 8 miles away, but Workhorse was thinking about stopping at the Thunder Hill Shelter because it was only 5 miles away. When I got close to the shelter around 5:30 pm, I found the two of them next to a road crossing. They had called for a shuttle to Stanimals, and although they invited me to come with them, I said no because of the logistical mess it would cause. Dreamcatcher really hates to be hiking in thunderstorms and there are storms predicted for tomorrow. They plan to take a zero tomorrow and slackpack the following day to miss out on the storms. (Coincidentally, we just entered a new area of the Jefferson National Forest called the “Thunder Ridge Wilderness”. And I’m staying at Thunder Hill Shelter.)So I lost my hiking buddies - they were fun company and hiking partners.I made it to the shelter which has a bubbling box spring and a bear box. I am poised for an early start tomorrow. Even if it storms, I’ll be at the hostel tomorrow night for my final laundry and resupply.7 days, 92 miles to go.","Middlecreek campground, Buchanan, VA

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592441,"Rained all night and I started out in the rain. About mid-day there was some weak sunshine and I thought things might be clearing up. After about 12 miles, I got to Matt’s Creek Shelter and suddenly there was a huge downpour. Jukebox and Head Chef were in the shelter trying to guess how many people were at the next shelter. Although there were only 3 other people at the shelter where I stayed, there were about 25 at the previous one. I’m not sure where all these people are coming from; I hardly see anyone all day.The skies cleared up again and I was congratulating myself for missing the downpour. I had only two miles left but got hit my another shower during the last mile. *sigh*The last part of my hike was over the James River Foot Bridge, which is a long, cool pedestrian bridge over the James River. It is named after Bill Foot, a local hiker. When I got to the parking lot, I barely had a phone signal. I called the hostel several times for a shuttle, but would only connect for a few seconds. I got a couple texts through to Dreamcatcher and Workhorse, and tried calling my sister so she could try the hostel. I realized the hostel was a little over 4 miles away, and I had plenty of daylight left, so I started walking. Fortunately, Donna, the caretaker, drove up just then. She drove me to the hostel which is so nice. I showered, did laundry, and dried out my stuff. I went with Workhorse, Bilbo, and Kalamazoo to the one restaurant in this little town and had eggplant parmigiana. Workhorse is excited to do his first slackpack tomorrow (basically the hike I did today, but without a full pack). I told him for tomorrow he would have to change his name to Racehorse. Then back to the hostel for going through my maildrop and getting ready to head out tomorrow.","Thunder Hill Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592556,"I got up at the hostel and ate breakfast. Donna came before 7 to take everyone’s payment and take a load of hikers back to the trail.I had to say goodbye to Workhorse and Dreamcatcher for the last time - very sad. The only thing that was good about that is they were trying to give me the trail name of “Princess Nomad”. I don’t like it because it’s kinda dumb, and it has too many syllables. The princess thing started once when Chance It and Workhorse were checking out my quilt. Several times I’ve pulled it out and other hikers ask “What IS that?” It’s stuffed with something high tech I forget the name of and the outside is cuben. It’s very lightweight and completely waterproof. It’s so waterproof that when I put it in the compression sac with a couple drops of water or sweat, they will still be there when I pull it out again. But it looks like a pile of wax paper or packing material. Chance It was touching it and asked me if it was cheap. I answered “No, it’s really expensive, but I need my princess gear”. And the nomad thing is kind of obvious. I’m really glad that there are all these lightweight options because it makes backpacking possible for so many more people.Anyway, I felt a little rushed this morning. I had a feeling that I left something behind and I only had a few sips of coffee. After 1.7 miles on the trail, I stopped at the Johns Hollow Shelter. I had coffee and drank a bunch of water since that was the only water before this shelter. Jukebox was still getting started and this South African couple stopped for a break. Back on the trail, my right knee was really painful. Every step was agony. I had a really heavy pack (6 days of food) and wasn’t sure how I was going to get through the day, much less the next six. I decided to drink a liter of water, and I don’t know if it was that I got rid of those two pounds of weight, or that the coffee kicked in, or the Advil that I took with the coffee kicked in, but in a little while I felt better. It’s one of the rare times when the afternoon went better than the morning.I was the first one into the shelter at 2:30 pm, but I was done. In a little while Imua showed up. He is a thru-hiker and was with his friend Ira at the Thunder Hill Shelter two nights ago. Ira had arranged to hike with Imua for 5 days, but left the trail this morning after 3 days. Imua and I talked about how hard the trail is and how it’s hard to explain it to people who have never experienced it. It’s such a 24/7 multifaceted endurance experience.Shadow (thru-hiker) showed up and set himself up in the shelter. Shortly after, Cathy came in. She lives near Waynesboro and hosted thru-hikers last year and got interested in the AT. She’s out for two weeks as an experiment to see if she wants to retire and do a thru-hike. I asked her what her husband thinks of it and she said her husband thinks she’s crazy. Shadow and I gave each other the “well, duh” look. It kind of goes with the territory. Cathy asked me why I do long-distance hiking and I have no good answer at this point. I do notice that after a few weeks I get desensitized to being out in nature. Right now it’s just about getting enough miles to get done in time.In between these conversations, I got my tent set up, hung my food rope, got water, and made dinner. As I started eating, a thunderstorm broke loose and we moved inside the shelter. The ground in front of the shelter became a temporary raging river. When the storm let up, I went to check my tent, and the floor was wet. Not sure if it seeped from the bottom, or wet through, or what. Briefly considered staying in the shelter, but there is a stagnant pond here and the bugs are horrible. I set up my tent with my sleeping pad out to lie on and my pack liner under my pack. It’ll be a damp night.Cathy’s husband told her there’s a second storm front rolling through later so I hope my tent holds up to that. People have been trickling in since I got in my tent.","Stanimal’s 328 Hostel Glasgow, VA

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592991,"The frogs were making an unbelievable amount of noise last night! I think there were three different species, from the sound of it.When I got up, my tent floor was dry. For the morning walk, we had sunshine, low humidity, and a breeze. I made the 10 miles to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter with no problem and stopped for lunch. Dandelion and Springbok, the South African couple stopped too. They were trying to convince me to go two more miles to Hogpen Gap, which has nice campsites. The AT hikers seem reluctant to go to this shelter because it’s 0.5 miles off the AT.The afternoon was hot and there was a 5-mile, 2600’ climb, so I soon gave up hope of making it any farther today. About an hour before the summit, I started to hear thunder which continued, but always far away. When I turned off the AT, the sky got dark but I made it to the shelter before a brief shower. I had been expecting to be here alone, but I was happy to see that Shadow was here.The bugs are horrible here! As I was making dinner, it was mostly tiny biting midges. All day long I was being driven crazy by gnats flying at my eyes. I am bug free in my tent, listening to the sound of the creek close by.","Punchbowl Shelter

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592993,"Woke up to mist and overcast skies. I went over some balds that probably have great views but all I saw was mist.I got to Hog Camp Gap and met 50 cent, who was just packing up. I met him again talking to a Ridge Runner at Salt Log Gap. Boy that Ridge Runner could talk! He asked us where we were going and I said Spy Rock and 50 cent said the Priest Shelter. The Ridge Runner said there would probably be a lot of weekenders at both locations. I asked him if the forecast wouldn’t deter them and he did say last weekend (Memorial Day weekend) there no weekenders out because of the rain.Shortly after I left there, it started to rain and it poured buckets for the three hours it took me to get to the Seeley-Woodworth Shelter. Shadow and 50 cent were there, planning to spend the night.I could have stayed there, but I really wanted to move on. Maybe to spite the rain, or to show the thru-hikers who are so condescending to me because I’m an old, slow section hiker. I was there for a while though. I was out of water, and there is no water here, so I got a bunch of water and filtered it. I made and ate dinner there, since it was easier there than it would be while tenting in the rain. As I was packing up, I dropped my lighter on the ground and it wouldn’t light. I tried using Shadow’s lighter to dry it out. 50 cent said to put it in my pocket, which seemed ridiculous considering my shorts were soaked. I stuck it in my bra, which was also soaked but it was just convenient. By the time I left, it was hardly raining.It was a 2.7 mile walk from the shelter to here. I wasn’t sure what I would find here, and right before here was a dirt road that said it was 1.9miles to the town of Montebello. I did think about going there, even though I wasn’t sure what was there. But I think if I got there, I would end up quitting hiking and getting a shuttle to Waynesboro. It’s amazing the effort I am putting into getting to a town that is such a short drive away.I came to a clearing and met an Australian woman on her way to the shelter I had just left. So nice to see a human! I saw a tent set up in a clearing (another human!). There was a campsite nearby, but I went further up to the trail to see if there were more protected spots. I ran into two Boy Scout leaders who seemed a little lost, or as they said, “disoriented”. They said there weren’t any camping sites ahead. They are hammocking nearby.I went back to the clearing, threw up my rope (which I got on the second try), set up my tent, ate some snacks, and hung my food bag. As I was setting up, the man in the other tent came out and we said hi.Now I am in my tent in my camp clothes, snug as a bug in a rug. I tried mylighter, and it works - phew. This campsite is so incredibly flat! Tomorrow is supposed to be the same weather-wise, and my pack and most of my stuff are wet.

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592994,"Not a miserable day at all!It rained a lot during the night. I kept hitting a mental “snooze” alarm because I wasn’t ready to face the day. A little after 7:00 I decided to get going because it was raining lightly and I should get going before it started raining heavily. I got changed into my wet cold slimy hiking clothes, got my food bag, ate breakfast, and got packed up. As I packed away my tent, the rain had stopped! And I didn’t realize it then, but it didn’t rain for the rest of the day. Mostly cool, overcast, and breezy.I passed The Priest shelter - you are supposed to confess your sins in the shelter register and I’ve heard it’s pretty entertaining reading. Then on the the summit of The Priest - for northbound thru-hikers, this is the last time they’ll be above 4000’ until Massachusetts. I met Half-slow? - maybe I don’t have the name right, but the guy Miss Janet is slackpacking. I haven’t seen him in a few weeks! He said there was trail magic at the bottom of the hill - specifically hamburgers and waffles.That hill was a doozy though - a 3000’ drop in 5 miles. I was ready for some Trail Magic when I got there. The couple doing it had hiked the AT in 2009. They had planned to come this weekend to do some hiking, but when they saw the weather forecast, they decided to do Trail Magic instead. They said they started yesterday during the downpour. Today they were serving eggs and bacon and toast made from Dave’s Killer Bread, my fave. Took another vero! And I had a Coor’s Light. Nice break with Pied Piper, Rooster, Jukebox, and Wilt.Then up to this shelter. I set up my tent by the creek, then went up to the shelter to make dinner. Serentina, who thru-hiked in 2010 and who I’ve met on the AT on other section hikes, was staying at the shelter. We had an interesting conversation about long distance hiking.There is also a couple tenting across the creek. I think most of the AT hikers went 7 miles further where there’s a road where you can hitch to the Devil’s Backbone brewpub. You have to hitch there, but they have free tenting for hikers, a $5 breakfast, and will shuttle hikers back to the trail. Sounds really fun, but I couldn’t do the miles today.Two more days, 27 more miles!","Spy Rock Junction

Judy W,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593135,"So... didn’t make it. 
I got up, and has been the case for for the past 4 days, I couldn’t put any weight on my right leg because of knee pain. It would loosen up after a couple miles, but each day seemed a little worse. I thought that since I only did 11.5 miles yesterday, I would be a little better, but that didn’t turn out to be the case. 
I got off to a late start (8 am), and made very slow progress up Three Ridges. Although The Priest was the last 4000’+ point, Three Ridges was 3966’. Then my next goal was the Three Ridges Overlook, a pullout on the Blue Ridge Parkway that had a trashcan. I took a break there, and tried to see my other options for the day since I didn’t think I would make the 14.5 miles that I planned. I decided to go to another parking area 4.3 miles ahead, that seemed to have water, and try to figure out a place to camp. There was a lot of hemming and hawing, and I started out. After a half mile, I called Adam (Stanimal) and he said he could pick me up, so I went back to the pullout I had just left. 
On a side note - an absolutely perfect June day - sunny, breezy, low humidity, and 78 degrees. 
When I got back to the pullout, Miss Janet drove by and pulled over to see if I was OK. I explained my situation and she gave me a Coke. 
I sat there listening to Dear Evan Hansen on my phone
“End of May or early JuneThis picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at À La Mode
And then we're there
All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day
We walk a while and talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Hike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool?
There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
""There's nowhere else I'd rather be""
And I say, ""me too""
And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view”
