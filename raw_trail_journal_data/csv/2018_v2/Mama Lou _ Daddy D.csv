Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553280,"Our primary preparation for hiking the AT has been our time hiking the Adirondack (ADK) 46 High Peaks (4,000'+). That was quite an adventure for us. We started together on Cascade on 11/8/2011.Due to complications from her many cancer treatments and surgeries we were unable to finish together. Mama Lou had to stop hiking in the High Peaks for over a year. Fortunately, she was blessed with a successful treatment and was able to resume in the summer of 2015. She was with me when I finished on Skylight Mountain on 8/9/2015. Thank you, Lord!",,Adirondack High Peaks,"Nov 08, Tue",0

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553320,"This was our first true hike on the AT. Since we began hiking in 2011 most of our hikes have been in the Adirondacks but we've also hiked in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and other spots. We actually did a few miles on the AT while visiting Hanover, NH and Harpers Ferry, WV.
At this point in our ""hiking career"" we had 33 ADK High Peaks under our belts, only 13 peaks left to go. The remaining hikes ranged from difficult to very difficult. It was still Black Fly season up in the ADK so we decided to head south for nicer hiking conditions. Besides, our son was attending college at nearby West Point, we borrowed his truck on the way south and dropped it off at our finishing point on Lakes Road.
It was a perfect day for a hike, mostly sunny with poofy clouds, temps in the 70's with low humidity. The first two people we met on the trail were thru-hikers, *Calamity and A-train. We started our hike in NJ and crossed over into NY after a few miles.
The hike had a fair amount of persistent climbing, mostly gradual but sometimes steep. A lot of ridge walking with great views before ducking back into a forest of Mountain Laurel. A great day to be on the trail!
*Two years later, in the Summer 2016 edition of the AT Conservancy Journal, we read an article by Jane ""Calamity"" Dailey, the first thru-hiker we'd met on the AT. She ended up finishing her hike in 2015. Nice!","Warwick Turnpike

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553322,"Soon after our 1st AT hike, Mama Lou came down with a serious complication from her many cancer surgeries. She had a serious occurrence of it on a hike in a remote area of Adirondacks, while completing our 35th High Peak. We were 7 miles from the trailhead with a lot of difficult hiking ahead of us, it was a very bad situation. Months later she was able to get some effective treatment. This was one of several rehabilitation hikes to get her trail legs back in shape.
We had Village Taxi (Fred) shuttle us over to Lakes Road to begin were we had finished last June. A 1/2 mile into our hike we were at Fitzgerald Falls, very pretty. We climbed to Mombasha High Point, enjoyed the view and listened to Spring Peepers chirp away in nearby mountain ponds. The terrain was quite varied, some flats with a lot of ups and downs, some of it steep and cliffy.
There was a great view at the top of Arden Mt. before the steep descent of Agony Grind. At the bottom was the crossing into Harriman State Park on Arden Valley Road. It was very cool to cross the NYS Thruway on the AT, just before Elk Pen. We had driven under the AT crossing of the Thruway hundreds of times over the years.","Lakes Road

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553329,"Village Taxi (Fred) picked us up at Elk Pen and drove us to the Visitor's Center in the middle of the Palisades Parkway. We walked in the median 4/10 of a mile to pick up the AT and, this time, headed south. After crossing the median and the southbound side of the Parkway we immediately began climbing up Black Mt and noticed it was a warm-ish day. Once at the top there were some great views, NY City was clearly visible in the distance. We ran into several northbound thru-hikers on Black and throughout the day. They've completed about 1400 miles at this point, very impressive!We had spent about a week in this area last month as our son graduated from West Point in May. We had a great time with him, his fiancé and our family, renting a house in nearby Cornwall. Two weeks later, his fiancé became his wife. It had been an exciting and busy month. Now, our kids are both out of college, married and living elsewhere. We're very proud of them but our nest is quite empty. There's nothing like a strenuous hike on a beautiful day to clear the mind of parental self-pity. We had a great day on the trail.","Palisades Parkway

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553334,"It was a beautiful fall day for a hike, 50's and sunny, no wind. Fred, our personal driver, from Village Taxi shuttled us from Garrison back across the Hudson to the middle of the Palisades Parkway. This was our second time starting at the Visitors Center, we walked up the median and headed north on the AT.On our hikes in the ADK we usually see no more than 15 or 20 people on a hike. We must have seen several hundred people throughout the day. It was Halloween so some of them were dressed in costumes. We passed several large groups, chatting with some along the way. They were all very nice, if not well equipped for a day out on the trail.
We enjoyed a trail lunch near Perkins Tower on Bear Mt., it was mobbed with people, and marveled at the crowds, costumes, honking horns and the view. It was different, weird but fun. We then made our way down the steep steps to Bear Mountain Inn (my HS prom was held there), Hessian Lake and into Bear Mt. Zoo. A zoo on the hiking trail, another unusual experience. It was neat to be on the lowest point on the AT in the zoo and then cross the Hudson on Bear Mt. Bridge.
After that, it was a steep climb up toward's Anthony's Nose and then another 4 1/2 miles back to our car. We had an enjoyable day.","Palisades Parkway

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553440,"Village Taxi (not Fred, this time) gave us a shuttle ride south to our starting point at the Appalachian Market at the intersection of US 9 and NY 403. It was a cool December morning so we began at a brisk pace to warm-up. Not surprisingly, we didn’t see many people out on the trail. This time of year, when the trail doesn’t get much traffic, the AT can be tough to follow in spots, especially where the blazes are spaced far apart or they’re old and faded. We completely lost it for about 10 or 15 minutes and had to back track, then found it had taken a hard left up a ridge that we’d missed.We took a couple of brief breaks but keep up a steady hiking pace. The sun goes down early this time of year in NY and we felt a bit pressed to finish before the sunlight faded in the woods. Mama Lou’s eyesight was compromised by the biologic therapies she received. She doesn’t see well on the trail in low light, even with a headlamp. Fortunately, we made it to Canopus Lake and our waiting van with about 20 minutes to spare.","Garrison (Rts. 403 & 9)

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553606,"Steve Brady, a long time family friend picked us up at the small parking area where the AT crosses Route 52 in Stormville. Steve lives in Stormville, literally a couple miles down the road, and was happy to give us a ride back to Route 301 in Fahnestock State Park.
This hike was a bit sentimental for me. I grew up in the area and was very familiar with the landmarks, views and roads. We walked past houses and crossed roads where high school friends had lived. Near the spot where the AT crosses the power lines is a view down into the valley where my high school and neighborhood can be seen in the distance. The weird part, growing up, the AT was less than three miles away and I had no clue it was so close.
We had a nice trail lunch on Shenendowa Mt, hiked along the ridge of Hosner Mt., enjoyed views of the Fishkill Plains and crossed over Stormville Mt. It was all so familiar. I enjoyed a new perspective of “home” from the AT.","Canopus Lake (US 301)

It was nice catching up with Steve again.The day started cool and cloudy but cleared and warmed up into the 50’s by midday. It was very pleasant. The highlights were crossing landmarks like Old Stormville Road, I 84, Mt. Egbert, Morgan Shelter, our first RR tracks, Route 55, Nuclear Lake, West Mt. and the Dover Oak.
The views from Mt. Egbert were nice, looking back at the Hudson Valley for the last time. Nuclear Lake was very pretty. We came across a large burned out area that was still smoking. It had been more than a brush fire. Also, apparently, there are Big Foot sightings near the lake. Really?
The view from Cat Rocks was the highlight of the day - bright blue sky, beautiful scenery and a snack, with only a mile left. This was a real nice hike, probably our easiest on the AT so far.","NY 52 - Stormville

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554045,"It was supposed to rain on Saturday so I took Friday off. We had a great early summer day for hiking, sunny and mid 70’s. Steve Brady picked us up at the parking area across the street from the Bull’s Bridge Inn, he and his wife, Carolyn have dinner there on occasion. It’s been nice seeing Steve, catching up with him and hearing about his grandkids, their trips to Europe and Disney World. Sadly, this was the last time we would see Steve. He died suddenly in early November. He’ll be sorely missed by many.This day, Steve dropped up back at the Dover Oak. We snapped some photos and said goodbye, for now. This was a unique hike. We walked through several cow pastures, listening to mooing from unseen cows, crossed a swamp river on a very long wood walkway, came to a train depot specifically for the AT, passed a wooden water tower, more cow pastures – dodging cow patties, climbed weird looking A frame ladders over electric fences, crossed long stretches in hay fields and finally headed back into the woods for some climbing.
We crossed into CT and enjoyed beautiful views from Ten Mile Hill before the walk along the steep “cliffs” of Ten Mile River. Once we came to Schaghticoke Road, we had to do a road walk to get back to our van, crossing the wooden Bull’s Bridge. We stopped by Anne’s Ice Cream in Kent and Chatham Brewery on the way home on the Taconic. A great day!","The Dover Oak

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554073,"Dave from Backcountry Outfitters (Kent, CT) picked us up at the small parking area where River Road turns into Dawn Hill Road and shuttled us back to the point where the AT meets Schaghticoke Road. It was a beautiful day, sunny and mid-80’s, a little warmer than the hiking weather we’re used to in the ADK, but nice.
After a ¼ mile flat warm up on the road we began climbing Schaghticoke Mt. At some point we briefly crossed back into NY but we were on the lookout for rattlesnakes (per Dave) and missed the sign. We did a long stretch of ridge walking with occasional overlooks (i.e., Indian Rocks) as we followed the Housatonic River north, far below. There was quite a bit of up and down followed by a long descent to Rt. 341. Then, a stiff climb up, more ups and downs and a final climb to Caleb’s Peak and a great view.
We could see the Housatonic waaay below. It was a steep climb down St. John’s Ledges to River Road. We finished with a nice flat river walk the last 4.7 miles. It was warm and our legs were beat. This hike was our final prep for Mama Lou’s last 6 High Peaks in the ADK. After that, in the fall, we’ll be back on the AT. We stopped by Chatham Brewery for beers, hamburgers, fries and a growler to go. Yum!","Bulls Bridge, CT

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554351,"Hip, hip…Hooray!! Mama Lou completed her ADK 46 on August 15th! Hiking all 46 High Peaks is a difficult challenge for anyone. For a Stage 4 cancer patient, it was an amazing journey and an unbelievable accomplishment! Peeks Magazine (a magazine for ADK 46ers) will be publishing her story in their spring 2017 edition.After a great visit with Brian and Chrisser in Germany (our son and his wife), we’re ready to start hiking the AT again. Dave of Back Country Outfitters picked us up and shuttled us back to the spot we left off at in June, Dawn Hill Road. After a brief warm-up walk we had a stiff climb. There was a lot of up and down in this hike, not a High Peak but definitely strenuous. There was some fall color but still a ways to go before peak leaf peeping.
The highlights were the overlook on Pine Knob (a ridge walk) and Hang Gliders View. The later was above the Lime Rock racetrack. We heard the roar of engines and the screeching of tires for a mile or more. We arrived safely back at our van at Routes 112 & 7 and stopped again at Chatham Brewing for a flight and fries.","Dawn Hill Road

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554724,"We decided to hike south on this section because our shuttle driver (Dave, again) hadn't been to the Bunker Hill Road parking lot. We met him at the Route 112 & 7 intersection and gave him directions on the way. The trail we started on is actually a side trail that took us to the AT after 1/2 mile. It was a beautiful sunny day with temps reaching 50, we headed north for the 0.3 mile climb up Lion's Head to catch the great view, passing two large Boy Scout troops on the way. We'll have to climb up there again when we hike north into Massachusetts over Bear Mt.After admiring the view we turned around and went south, descending 1,000'+ into Salisbury. The fall colors in the woods were very pretty, the morning air was crisp and clear. We walked through Salisbury, climbed a ridge, stopped for lunch at Billy's View, hiked past Giant's Thumb and enjoyed the panoramic view of the mountains from Rand's View. We went up and over Mt. Prospect, descending to the Great Falls on the Housatonic, then over the river and through the woods back to our van we went.
This was a nice fall hike. There was a fair number of people out enjoying the day. We made another pit stop at Chatham Brewing and had two festive beers, Pumpkin Ale and Maple Ale, both very good.","Lion's Head

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555644,"For our last AT hike of 2016 we decided to leap frog the last part of CT (14+ miles) and do our first hike in MA. We were concerned that we’d run out of daylight on the steep descent of Jug End. We’ll go back and pick up that section in the spring or summer. It only took us an hour and ten minutes to drive to Great Barrington. Kai picked us up at the AT lot on Route 23 and shuttled us over to the ATC Center on *Route 41. From there it was a short walk to pick up the AT. It was a cool, breezy, cloudy day with temps in the 30’s and some snow flurries early on.
The first half of the hike was mostly flat => footbridges, woods, Shay’s Monument, fields with freshly spread manure (yum!), the ever present Housatonic, RR tracks and roads. After about 5 miles we entered the woods again on Boardman St. and climbed June Mt. We stopped at Homes Road for a rest and a snack but we soon felt cold and warmed up by climbing East Mt. We enjoyed some great views of the Housatonic Valley as we ridged walked. From there, the hike to Tom Leonard Shelter seemed to take forever. After that the terrain and footing improved and we finished the last 2 miles quickly.
It was a cold-ish day but a nice hike. We stopped at Barrington Brewing for a flight and a pint. We’ll start hiking the AT again in March. Until then, take a look at some of our photos to see how we’re keeping our legs in trail condition during the winter.
*On our our CT Hike #4 (7/16/17) we had to park our van at Jug End Road and missed the 0.9 mile piece that goes to MA Route 41. On June 29, 2018, after we finished up a section up in Pittsfield, we drove south and walked the short section between Jug End and MA 41.","Jug End Road

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560585,"We’re back, our first hike on the AT in 2017. We kept in shape by snowshoeing and hiking in the southern Adirondacks. We had hoped to get back on the AT in March but several big snow storms late in the month changed our plans.
We’re not yet in prime hiking condition so we started with a modest hike in terms of elevation gain. We chose the middle of NJ and met our shuttle driver at the Wallkill River Refuge parking area - George Lightcap. We enjoyed our brief time with George, very much. He completed a 27 year section hike of the AT a few years ago. That was encouraging for us, since we’re doing a relatively casual hike of the AT.
It was a partly cloudy with temps in the low 60’s, a nice spring day. George dropped us off at the High Point State Park HQ on NJ Route 23. Early on, we ran into a section hiker from Maine heading to Duncannon, PA. He was back on the AT after healing up from breaking his leg while on the trail in Kent, CT. Soon after, we came upon a couple from Ohio working on the final third of their three AT section hikes, “only” 600 miles left!
The trail was dry and in good shape with some nice early spring scenery from ridges and farm fields. There was more descending than climbing but after 14+ total miles, our legs still felt it. We finished up with a scenic walk of the Liberty Loop trail around the Wallkill Refuge, adding 2.5+ (1.5 AT) miles to our hike, but, it was flat, grassy and soft.","High Point State Park - NJ Route 23

Savannah, from Edge of the Woods Outfitter, picked us up at the north parking area on Millbrook Road and shuttled us back to Delaware Water Gap, PA. She told us that we’re her first hiker pickup of the season.
We started at the parking area on Delaware Ave, walking across the bridge from PA into NJ was cool (see photo). The sky was cobalt blue without a cloud to be seen. Pretty, but a bit warm as the temps edged above 80. As we climbed up the ridge toward Sunfish Pond we found there was less leaf cover down here than we expected. We kept Mama Lou protected from the sun with sunscreen, long sleeves, a hat and a handy umbrella.
We leaped frog with three other AT hikers throughout the day and enjoyed a couple of snack breaks with them in shady spots, see photo. In spite of the strong sun and warm conditions, we made good time and enjoyed the scenic views up on the ridge. The breeze was great!
Back at our van, we stripped out of sweaty clothes, settled in for a 3 hour drive and looked forward to a well earned pizza and a full growler back home.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564553,"Another Friday, another great hiking day, another day off. We enjoyed another shuttle ride with George Lightcap. He picked us up at the large AT parking lot in Culver's Gap (near NJ Rt. 206) and dropped us back at the small lot on Millbrook Road. The temps today were about 20 degrees cooler than our last hike, with some clouds and a lot more leaf cover, much more comfortable hiking conditions. The trail was in great shape, with some rough spots (just for fun) and less climbing than usual. There was about 2 miles of woods road walking up on the ridge before Blue Lakes Road that was particularly nice.
We only saw five hikers on the trail today. A group of three section hikers who had started in Harper's Ferry last month and a flip flopping couple (sounds like a pejorative - it's not) who started at Bear Mt. and were heading south. We enjoyed nice views on Rattlesnake Mt., Bird Mt. (with a view north to the High Point Monument) and a ridge clearing about 2 miles from the finish with Culver's Lake and Route 206 in view. After that it was a steep descent down to and across 206, through the woods and back to our faithful van. All in all, a great day and enjoyable hike!","Millbrook Road - Hardwick, NJ

This was our 3rd shuttle ride with George. It's a real pleasure chatting with him. He mentioned that it was the 4th anniversary of the completion of his AT section hike. He's looking forward to healing up and getting back on the trail himself - we're praying for you George!
By the way, the Adirondack PEEKS article on Mama Lou's hiking journey while battling cancer was published last week. We're hopeful that it will be an encouragement to those who read it. We clearly see God's hand in all of it. We're not sure why He chose to bless her in that way but we're very thankful!
We had another great hiking day, with lots of company - due to Memorial Day weekend and the nearby State Park. We began with a climb up to the Culver Fire Tower, enjoying views there and along the way. Once up on the ridge there were ups, downs and flats to make the hike interesting. The trail was mostly comfortable dirt and pine needles with several rocky sections. We took a break at Sunrise Mountain and at a pipeline clearing, both with nice views. Big news for us - we went over the 200 AT mile mark today!","Culver's Gap - Sandyston, NJ

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568247,"George dropped us off at Liberty Corners Road where we headed backwards (AT south) 1/2 mile to the Wallkill Reserve trail exit off Liberty Loop. This allowed us to connect our NJ #1 hike (3/2017) and NY #1 hike (6/2014). It was an easy walk on boards through the swamp with an up close deer sighting (photo). We turned around (AT north) and with our legs warmed up, climbed Pochuck Mt where we enjoyed a nice overlook view across the valley.
A few miles later we came to the Pochuck Boardwalk, a very long boardwalk with a wooden suspension bridge to boot, it was very pretty. The only downside, we were in the direct sun for a while, so Mama Lou pulled out her trusty umbrella. We took a break before the stiff climb up Wawayanda Mt. and the view at Pinwheel's Vista. There haven't been many climbs on our AT hikes that have been persistently steep, this was the longest. Nothing like the ADK, or the Whites to come, but certainly a good heart thumper. We had a lot of company enjoying the great view at the Vista.
After that, we finished up our last 4 miles in NJ, closing the loop at Warwick Turnpike where we began our inchworm hike on the AT in June 2014. We must say, hiking in NJ has been a very pleasant surprise. Now we head north to finish CT and then it's up to NH and some real mountain hiking - while our legs are in good trail shape.

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572010,"We had originally planned on hiking the last section of CT into MA that we had skipped over in December. However, an ever changing forecast that involved T-storms changed our minds. If possible, we try to avoid being on mountains when thunder boomers are rolling around. Also, we normally don’t do strenuous hikes two weeks in a row, due to on-going cancer treatment complications that Mama Lou deals with. So, we decided on a relatively short AT hike for us. Now, short doesn’t mean easy. We have (at least) two hiking mottos, “The hardest climb, is the one you’re doing.”  And, as all hikers know, “There’s always more up.” Both were a good fit for this hike.
We started on Main Road in Tyringham. After crossing the road we began a persistent climb up Baldy Mountain. It wasn't a crazy climb but it was so humid that it felt like we were hiking with a hot, wet towel wrapped around our bodies. Plus – tons of sweat! This was mostly a woods walk without many sights to see and several ups and downs along the way.
Upper Goose Pond was nice. We met three thru-hikers and a flip flopper along the way. The highlight was the AT bridge crossing over the Mass Pike (I 90). We’ve driven under it many times so it was very cool to hike across it. We live close enough to take two cars, so we didn’t need a shuttle ride for this trip. We’re hopeful that Mama Lou’s legs hold up well and our little experiment was a success.","Main Road, Tyringham, MA

Today, we met Kai at Jug End Road and he drove us back to the Bunker Hill Road parking area. The morning was sunny and cool for July as we began our walk up the approach trail to Lion’s Head, retracing our steps from the CT #3 hike last October.
  

Our first climb was up Bear Mt. where we enjoyed a great view with several other day hikers. Then it was a steep descent to Paradise Lane trail where we took a sweaty break before continuing down to Sages Ravine. By this time, we’d crossed into MA, finishing our 4th state on the AT (NY, NJ, CT, WV – all 4 miles of it). From there, it was a long, gradual climb up to the escarpment and Mt. Race for wild blueberries and an amazing view. Not surprisingly, this is where we saw the most people.  We took a break just past Race before the steep climb down to the col and a steep climb up Mt. Everett.


There weren’t any good views from the summit of Mt. Everett but there was a nice overlook just past it. My bladder kicked on the descent and my reserve liter was gone, fortunately, there was a trail blessing of water jugs at the Guilder Pond Picnic area. We normally don’t partake, since we’re lowly AT day hikers, but with 4 miles left, we made an exception today and filled our Nalgene’s. The last 4 miles was a series of downs and ups as we worked our way down, the climbs were unexpected and a bit frustrating as our legs were tiring. The last mile+ was a steep climb down to our van where, in our desire to get cleaned up, we felt the irresistible “hiker trash” pull for the first time and took a ""van bath"" ;).

was low for July, much lower than our last couple of hikes. Plus, with the
exception of the last two miles, the mostly soft trail made for easy walking; we
were able to get into a nice rhythm, especially on the climbs.
After a 3 hour drive north, Steve “Stray Cat” Lake shuttled
us from the Dorchester Road lot to Etna Road, before heading off to pick up a
sick thru hiker. Naturally, we started with a climb, nothing crazy, just enough
to get the blood pumping. Climbing up to the south peak of Moose Mt. we took a
break because ML’s legs were feeling “buzzy” and heavy from the lymphedema. The
break helped and she felt much better the rest of the day.
After catching a nice view on the South Peak, it was a down
and up to the North Peak. As we were descending the back side we found a nice
shady ledge and took a lunch break. Then, a steep descent to Goose Pond Road,
more pine covered dirt trails, a Beaver Dam and then a steady, steep climb up
to Holt’s Ledges and a nice view. On the way up to Holt, we heard voices in
front of us and were surprised to hear, “Hi Dennis, Hi Mary Lou!” It was Steve,
his wife (Keely – I apologize for any misspelling) and their dog, Sadie. It was
such a great day they decided to hit the trail too. We had a real nice chat
with them.
After Holt, we descended steeply and quickly, crossed Lyme-Dorchester
Road and were surprised that we only had 2 miles left. The last two miles of the
trail paralleled L-D Road, with conditions that were the worst of the day (a
climb on mud, big rocks and roots), ending at the parking area further up the
road. All in all – a great first day on the AT in NH!!","Etna-Hanover Center Road

The theme was up, down, up, down. Our day started with a bear sighting, it sprinted across a farmer’s field, across the road and right in front of our van.
Steve shuttled us again but he was super busy with rides in the morning. He offered to pick us up at the end of the hike and bring us back to our van. We’d never done that before and were a little hesitant but we came up with a plan and agreed to meet at NH 25A at 5:30 PM. I’d call him from the top of Mt. Cube to confirm. Steve assured me we’d have great cell coverage up there.
We were on the trail just after 9:00 AM, after a 3 hour drive, and immediately began climbing up to Lambert’s Ridge and some nice views. We kept climbing until we could see Smarts Mt. in the distance. After more climbing, we took a break at the Ranger Trail. We continued to climb up to the Smarts Mt. fire tower, where my tired body suggested that I text Steve to adjust our ETA to 5:45. The next leg was a welcome 4 mile, mostly gradual, descent down to South Jacob’s Brook. Once there, we took a lunch break and chatted with a nice section hiking couple, from Glencliff, NH and Cape Cod, respectively.
From there, it was up and over Eastman Ledges, made more interesting by a 15 minute rain shower, and then the long climb up Mt. Cube. Fortunately, Mt. Cube wasn’t as steep as we thought it might be. We took a needed rest at the top and I called Steve before the final 3 ½ miles down to 25A. We arrived at 5:45 on the nose and were very happy to see Steve waiting for us.","Lyme-Dorchester Road (north)

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577401,"We decided to make our first hike in the Whites a little get away and spent two enjoyable nights at the Woodstock Inn. We also attempted a first for us, hiking two days in a row. That may sound weird for an AT trail journal. All of the hiking we’ve done has been day hikes, made necessary by side effects from Mama Lou’s many cancer surgeries, usually with a two week rest between hikes.
Our first day, we got a ride from the wonderful folks at the Hikers Welcome Hostel on Route 25, over to Kinsman Notch. Legion dropped us off with Ski Poles, Pawkey and Gandalf, they headed north. We headed south and up Mt. Moosilauke on the very steep Beaver Brook trail. Stray Cat advised a SOBO hike, we were glad we took it.
The day began sunny and cool, in the low 50’s, very comfortable for climbing along the beautiful cascades of Beaver Brook. We climbed steadily and felt strong. By the time we reached the Asquam Ridge Trail (4,050’) the climb wasn’t as steep but we were heading into the clouds. The cloud cover was thicker as we past tree line were it was very windy and cold, with eerie lighting. We thought we were alone on the summit with two other hikers and were surprised to see people huddled behind rock piles trying to avoid the wind. One of the young lady hikers snapped a summit photo of us, we quickly put on our gortex tops and kept on walking. Out of the wind, we stopped for lunch at the Glencliff Trail and the sun reappeared.  We were later told the summit cleared about 45 minutes after we left - oh well.
The climb down to Route 25 was long, very steep and rocky. But, we made good time down, passing a ton of people heading up. Once on 25, It was a quarter mile back to the Hostel and our trusty van. We drove back to Woodstock for a well earned IPA - or two.","Kinsman Notch

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577403,"Bag of Tricks, a former thru-hiker from Westchester PA, gave us a ride from Hikers Welcome Hostel to NH 25A, the spot we had finished our NH #2 hike on August 11th. Tricks is sweet man with a huge heart. We had met him the day before and enjoyed our conversation with him on the ride to 25A. He is a God fearing man with a deep love and respect for people, especially AT hikers. We tried to give him a tip. He declined and asked for a hug from each of us instead.
We were back heading NOBO today, our first attempt at hiking two days in a row, it began with fatigued legs but we felt surprising good once we got going and hiked strong. That said, even thought it was a perfect hiking day, we were eager to finish. After 1.6 miles we crossed Cape Moonshine Road and came upon the Omelette Man. He’s become rather famous the last couple of years for setting up a cooking camp right on the trail, preparing omelettes for hungry thru-hikers. It was very cool to see him. He invited us to sit and have something to eat. There were other hikers coming behind us and, since we are but lowly day hikers, we thanked him, politely declined and continued.
This hike was mostly a pleasant woods walk but had a fair amount of climbing. After Mt. Mist (a bump in the woods) we stopped for lunch at a vista with a great view of Mt. Moosilauke. We continued, through some steep descents, our tired legs ready to be done and finally came to NH 25. There were tables set up with a Trail Blessings lunch for AT hikers, several who had passed us were enjoying themselves. We waived hello, walked up the road, got a photo with Tricks and headed home on our 3 1/2 hour drive.","NH 25A

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577405,"We originally planned to do a one day traverse from Kinsman Notch to Franconia Notch today, in NH. However, after speaking with Legion two weeks ago and doing some research, it became obvious that we would need at least 13 hours of daylight to make it safely across. So, with our legs in good hiking shape, we decided to start tackling some of the peaks in VT, first up on the list - Killington.
This was another tale of two different days - one at low elevation and the other high up on the trail. The day began and ended with blue skies, some clouds and comfortable temps. After beginning the climb up Killington the sun was gone, the trail was wet and muddy and then the rain came. What! After getting teased by the sun for 5 minutes we were back hiking in the clouds and would remain there until the last few miles. We’re used to hiking on wet, muddy, root and rock infested trails but we can’t say it’s much fun.
During our hike, we leap frogged with a nice thru-hiker from CA, Dark Matter. When we got back to Route 4 we saw her walking up the road and into the parking lot. We asked if she needed a ride. She said she was going to Rutland. She was quite relieved when we told her we were heading that way. We dropped her at the Yellow Bird Hostel, three doors down from the Hop N Moose brew pub. We saw her in there a bit later and were happy to buy her a beer and wish her a safe hike north. To be honest, as parents with kids her age, we’re a little concerned that she’s so far south so late in the season, with the Whites and Maine still left to go. We floated the idea of her leaping ahead to tackle the more difficult parts first but she seemed determined to continue from here.","Cold River Road - Lower

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579190,"Unlike NY, CT and NH (so far) our hikes in MA and VT will be a bit haphazard. We’ll be jumping around based on our conditioning (trail legs), the difficulty of the hike and how much daylight we have. We’re in pretty good shape so we decided to tackle Mt. Greylock before the days wane further. I’ll try to note landmarks in the titles of our journal entries to give points of reference.
Vic picked us up at the Pattison Road parking area and shuttled us over to the trail intersection on MA 8 in Cheshire. We had a nice chat with him on the way and drove past Berkshire Outfitters. We purchased two Jamis bikes from Steve there two years ago. He was very helpful - a big thumbs up! The climb up and down Mt. Greylock wasn’t as steep as we thought it would be. That said, it’s no way an easy hike, a lot of ups and downs in between the ascent and descent.
We saw almost no-one on the climb up. As we neared the summit, we had quite a bit of company. It was a beautiful day! We were hoping for some nice fall foliage but the colors are muted and late this year. That didn’t stop people from driving up nor our enjoyment of our lunch near the summit monument. Another big plus - flush toilets in Bascom Lodge! A big treat as compared to the side of the trail amenities on most of our hikes.
We passed a lot people going up on our way down and enjoyed some additional views from Mt. Williams and Mt. Prospect. From there it was a steep climb down but not a killer, the switchbacks helped. We treated ourselves to a “van bath” and a visit to Bright Ideas Brewing, just a few miles away, near Mass MoCA.","MA 8, Cheshire

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579682,"Wow, what a great autumn day for a hike in Vermont! It was a
crisp, cool morning with bright blue skies and some high up clouds. As we walked through the wilderness of the
Green Mountain Forest, it warmed to the low 60’s in the afternoon.
Chris Burke picked us up at the large parking
area on USFS 10 and shuttled us on a bunch of back roads,
most of them dirt, to USFS 21. After a brief warm up walk,
we began climbing Styles Peak. It was a persistent 1,000 foot climb but not
bad. There was a nice overlook at the top. From there, it was down a bit, over to
and then up Peru Peak. A very nice woods walk. There was no real view, only a
sense that we were at elevation (3,429’).
We then headed down to Peru Peak Shelter where we met and
chatted with two AT trail volunteers. The walk along Griffith Lake was mostly on
a relatively new boardwalk – thank you! After discovering a hedgehog on the
trail (see photo), and another nice walk in the woods, we made the steep climb
up Baker Peak and the best view of the day. We had lunch at the upper most look
out and enjoyed the beauty of southern VT.
The toughest park of the day was the ankle turning, leaf
covered rocks between Lost Pond Shelter and Old Job Trail. Ouch! We loved the
Big Branch suspension bridge, very cool. We spoke briefly with a few SOBO thru
hikers before finishing up at USFS 10 and the very welcome trail side bathroom.

decided to hike back to back weeks. It’s a bit unusual for us but Mama Lou has
been blessed with some healing in the complications she deals with. Chris
“LT Gourmet” Burke met us on Old Rootville Road, near the water tower, and
shuttled us back to USFS 21. We decided to hike southbound to avoid
the 1.8 mile climb up (1100’ gain) to the AT.

We started with a gentle climb up Bromley that steepened
closer to the top. We stopped to talk with Marge Fish, an LT volunteer marking
water bars for repair, with her Chocolate Lab, ""Bromley."" It was
another beautiful autumn day in Vermont. I actually hiked in short sleeves for
most of the day. The summit of Bromley had great views and an alien spaceship
(photo). After exploring the ski lift and the warming hut we began the
descent to VT 11&30. On the way, we passed a ton of casual hikers heading
up, including several more Labs - what fun!

After crossing 11&30, the crowded trail cleared out
quite a bit. We leap frogged and chatted with a LT hiking couple looking to
finish at the MA border in four days. We talked hiking, of
course, they seemed intrigued by the challenge of the Adirondacks. We found a
nice secluded lunch spot on Spruce Peak, not far off the trail (photo). After
that, we made good time on the ups and downs to Old Rootville Road and enjoyed
the view at Prospect Rock (photo). Then we walked the steep 1.8 miles down
to our van. We enjoyed another van bath and stopped at Madison Brewing Company
in Bennington for a flight and left with a growler of their Chocolate Peanut

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580657,"This was our last planned AT hike for 2017 - 200 miles this year. We wrap up our longer distance hikes before the days get too short. Like we did for MA Hike #2 in mid-June, we drove two vehicles, dropped one in Tyringham and drove the other to the parking area on MA 23 where we had finished MA Hike #1 last December. We got an early start so we could get home before dark and because a cold November rain was forecast to start after 3:00.
The temps were in the high 20’s when we started. Fortunately, we began climbing right away and that warmed us up. It was colder once we reached The Ledges and up on Mt. Wilcox. There was a light coating of snow on the ground and we were even treated to some freezing rain, but it didn’t last long.
We hiked well and made good time, even though ML had a biopsy last week - praying for good news! It warmed up a bit as we descended to Fernside Road. We actually lost the trail on the way down and had to back track on the road about 1/4 mile. We found the trail and met Atlas and Just Jeni, Flip Floppers who only have 400 miles left before they finish at Pine Grove Furnace Park in PA. We had a nice chat with them. Congratulations!
After that it was a short trip down, over and up Cobble Hill with a great view of Tyringham. We walked through a cow pasture - got some strange looks from the cows - across the old boardwalk over very wet ground and back to our car. We finished at 2:32. Perfect timing too, it began raining on the drive over to MA 23 to get our van.","MA Route 23

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591028,"OK, first things first, soon after our last journal entry in 2017, the biopsy results confirmed that Mama Lou has a recurrence of the cancer. That was a major punch in the gut! The good news, she's receiving treatment and, based on the first scan, it seems to be working. There are side effects but she's able to do most things, including hiking, but we need to be cautious. On the day we found out about the cancer recurrence, our first grandchild was born. Talk about the blessings and challenges of life all in one day. More good news, we're expecting our second grandchild in December!
Our first AT hike of 2018 is...complicated. We actually hiked this section on 3 separate days. The first was a short, aborted attempt due to soft snow. We did a lot of hiking in the snow this winter with our microspikes. The conditions were lousy and we were sick of hiking in snow (see Warner Hill photo). Next, we came back and finished the Grange Hall Road to Blotz Road section as an out and back test hike to see how Mama Lou's legs would hold up on longer hikes. She did great!
On April 28 we tackled the balance of the section with a 12 mile hike, from Cheshire to Grange Hall Road. We decided to hike SOBO due to parking considerations. The conditions started poor but the day turned out nice. The climb up The Cobbles wasn't bad. There was still some snow up on the ridge but not too much. We enjoyed our lunch by a beaver pond, descended off the ridge and enjoyed the walk through Dalton. The toughest part of the day was the stiff little climb up Day Mountain back to our van.
We continue to thank God for life's many blessings, even with the challenges. We're praying for a good outcome and will continue our journey on the AT for as long as the Lord allows.","MA 8, Cheshire

Mama Lou & Daddy D,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591293,"We wanted to get out for another AT hike this weekend but Mama Lou had a cancer treatment on Monday. The treatments can knock her for a loop or, sometimes, she feels totally fine. She felt fine this week so we decided to venture out, but kept it a shorter hike, just in case. 

Dave Ackerson met us at the small parking area on Pattison Road, where we had finished up our traverse over Mt. Greylock last fall, and shuttled us north to County Road. We had a nice chat with Dave on the way. He has less than 1,000 miles to go on his AT adventure. It turns out he's a Cortland State alum, just like us. Go Red Dragons! 

We weren’t sure what County Road would be like so we decided to hike SOBO. It’s a nasty road! We were willing to walk part of the way but Dave was a trooper and brought us right to the AT intersection. We were surprised to see a car parked in a small parking area.


It was a beautiful day for a hike, a rare treat this spring. It was mostly ups and downs for the first three miles. We had a later start than normal so we took a lunch break at the VT / MA border. We enjoyed trading texts with our kids, wishing ML a happy Mother’s Day. From there it was mostly downhill back to North Adams. We caught a nice view just off the AT, at the Pine Cobble Trail intersection. From there, it was a steep, rocky climb down and then a muddy walk next to a beautiful stream.

We enjoyed walking through North Adams, with the spring green and flowers popping out all over. We saw our first Thru Hiker of the year, just north of Pattison Road. Bolt had left Springer Mt. in February and was looking to finish on Katahdin in mid-June. Wow, very impressive!

Mama Lou was feeling great last weekend, we did a lot of work around the house and then she had another busy day on Monday. But, she was completely exhausted the next two days. The side effects of these cancer treatments can be a day to day thing. So, out of a sense of caution, we chose a shorter hike. 
Our conversation was pretty funny when I suggested a shorter hike. Mama Lou responded, “I can hike eight miles!” …said the grandmother, battling cancer!!
We weren’t able to find a shuttle ride. We’re close enough so we took two cars, dropped one at the VT Route 140 parking lot and drove back to the lot on USFS 10. It was overcast and wet with a light rain as we started but the sun soon came out. I could tell Mama Lou wasn’t feeling 100% but, as you can probably tell if you’ve read her story, she’s game in the face of adversity (as she says, “it’s all God”). 
We passed the time counting Red Efts (Newts) on the trail (34), stopping for an early lunch at the Homer Stone bridge. We took it slow, especially on the climbs, chatted and enjoyed our time on the trail together. The day turned out to be beautiful.

We decided to hike SOBO so we could finish near the MA Pike and drive out to visit our daughter and son-in-law for the Father’s Day weekend. They recently moved from near Milwaukee, WI to the Hartford, CT area. And…they’re expecting their first child!! We’re thrilled to have them so close to us! Our son and his wife had our first grandchild last October - a sweet little girl!
We've found this part of MA, from Tyringham to Cheshire, to be mostly a long woods walk, popping into an occasional town, pleasant hiking with limited scenery (Warner Hill, Cheshire Cobble). We passed a bunch of Thru-hikers and Section hikers heading north, chatting with several of them. We had a nice talk with Hikernutt and her husband, from Dalton, GA. They were headed to North Adams, MA, hoping to finish up this section before their time runs out. We also visited with a local hiker near Finnerty Pond, she was backpacking to October Mt. Shelter. It going to be a busy night there, several Thru-hikers mentioned that was their likely destination for the night.
We completed MA with this section. Yay! It was an easy, enjoyable hike for us. It was a great way to start a very happy Father’s Day weekend.

It started nice enough, a sunny, cloudless day with cobalt blue skies and low humidity - perfect summer hiking weather. Silvia Cassano picked us up at the parking area on VT 9 and shuttled us over to County Road. Good news, compacted gravel was added to this formerly nasty road so Silvia was able to drive us to the trail head without any problem.
From there, we made the steady climb up to the unnamed ridge, took in a limited view and continued to the power lines (a better view) and down to Roaring Branch. At the old beaver pond we stopped for a photo to commemorate our 400th AT mile and chat with a couple of guys from Columbus, OH who were in the early stages of a NOBO trek of the Long Trail. We continued up to Consultation Peak, took a lunch break and headed down past Sucker Pond to Congdon Shelter. The shelter is right on the trail so we took a break and talked with an AT thru-hiker from Indianapolis.
Now for the weird part, less than a mile past the shelter I saw two people on the trail heading towards us from the opposite direction. My first impression was they were wearing very light colored clothing. I took a closer look and exclaimed, “Holy cow, they’re naked!” I took one last quick look to make sure I wasn’t seeing things - yup, not a stitch of clothing. Backpacks and hiking boots (I think), that’s it. Mama Lou and I stepped to the side of the trail, looking with intense interest into the empty woods, I yelled out for them to come on through. As they (a middle aged man and woman) passed by, she said “thanks,” with a touch of sarcasm in her tone, we turned north and responded, “have a nice hike,” and continued on our way. 
I thought naked hiking day on the AT was June 21st?! We later spoke with the guys from Columbus and another hiking group who had a similar experience, the consensus was, “Well, it is Vermont, after all.” Ticks - poison ivy - horse flies - sunburn…a very strange choice of attire. Later, after the gentle climb up to Harmon Hill we made the very steep descent back to VT 9.
Sadly, this is our last AT hike for the foreseeable future. The complications that Mama Lou is dealing with from the cancer treatments are just too much. The other AT hikes we have in front of us are too difficult to safely continue. So, we have to stop, for now. We’ve been down this road before when we were hiking in the Adirondacks, Mama Lou had to take a year hiatus from ADK hikes. We’ll continue to do shorter workout and pleasure hikes to keep our trail legs in shape, while we pray and hope for a good outcome (no cancer! no complications!) and a return to the AT sometime in the near future.
I’m certain that no one other than Mama Lou and I read this journal. That said, best wishes to all of you on the trail. Enjoy the journey and keep the faith!","County Road
