RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555132,"I have been following hikers on Trail Journals for three years in an effort to learn from the experiences recorded here (and to enjoy the journeys vicariously). I even met the couple that maintains Trail Journals at the 2016 Gathering. (We should all consider providing whatever support we can for this great service.) Even though I have known for almost four years that I would attempt a thru-hike in 2018, I decided to wait until the one-year mark before I depart to join this community. I launched my website today. I signed up at Facebook for 2018 AT The-hikers and I started my Trail Journal here. I look froward to meeting fellow members of the AT Class of 2018. Please follow along and encourage me to complete this dream and commitment that has simmered for 40 years.RTK","

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555336,"When I was finally able to arrange my work life to be able to plan an attempt at a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, I was so excited at the time, I started a website to capture my motivation and planning. The website was named ""Returning to Katahdin."" (See About page for more details.) When I planned to hike the Overland Track in Tasmania that same year I joined a Tasmania hiking forum so I could ask some questions about my planned trek. To participate in the forum you had to login with a ""trail name"" - so I named myself ""RTK"" - for Returning To Katahdin. So, for now, I'm ""RTK,"" but I'm open to the Trail providing a new trail name.","Springer

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555544,"I gave considerable thought to whether my attempt to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail should be northbound, southbound or a flipflop. There are certainly pros and cons to the different options. My final decision was to go NOBO. My primary reason for being a GAMER is that heading north has become such a tradition (and I have followed so many the-hikers here and on blogs and YouTube on NOBO hikes) I wanted to experience the Trail in the same way. I wanted to hit Mountain Crossings and the NOC early. I want move from the Great Smokies to Virginia and arrive in Damascus after 4 or 5 weeks on the Trail. I want to work my way up the east coast and have a spectacular finish in the Whites and into Maine. In short, after thinking through all of the alternatives and all the pros and cons, I wanted to experience the trail in the same manner as I have experienced it vicariously for the last three years. While I am concerned about the large numbers on the AT early. I hope a February start will get me out ahead of the bubble. So, northbound, Georgia to Maine it is. I can hardly wait, but now its less than a year.","

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555575,"Last week I announced my decision to attempt a thru-hike in 2018, beginning on February 25.   As many know, it is wider thought that it takes about 5,000,000 steps to walk the length of the AT. Last week, with 52 weeks to go, I also committed to walk 5,000,000 steps before I departed on Feb. 25, 2018. To accomplish that, one must walk approx. 13,700 steps per day or approximately 95,000 steps per week. After one week (Saturday to Friday), I had walked 84,039 - a little less than the average I need. (Yet, I did get in over 17,000 steps already today so I'm staying fairly close to the number I need.)","

Although I had a great morning of walking from home to work (26,000 steps and just over 12 miles), I'm about a half of a day behind pace to walk 5,000,000 steps before my departure in February 2018. I did a blog post about attempting the 5,000,000 steps - https://returningtokatahdin.com. I'm heading out now before the snow comes so I can catch-up with my steps! Also enjoying some YouTube videos of early hikers already reaching the NOC and Fontana Dam. Its really fun to live vicariously through the Class of 2017.RTK","

 After photos at the famous arch, hike begins with easy walk to base of highest falls east of Mississippi. Climb 600 steps. Falls were pretty with strong flow. From there the trail rolls over a number of short claims followed by pleasant ridge walking. The trail was mostly earthen with only modest amounts of rocks. Other than a long, fairly severe descent into Nimblewell Gap, the trail was not as ""severe"" as advertised. The trip to the summit concludes with a long, gentle climb up the contours of the mountain, finally finishing at the well known plaque and first white blaze signaling the start of the 2,200 mile Appalachian Trail. After some celebratory M&Ms (thank you Wendy) we took our first steps on the AT and descended gently although over a noticeably more rocky and challenging trail util we reached a parking lot where a shuttle took us back to our lodging for the night.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583821,"Clear cool night, dropped down to high 30's/low forties.  I was very comfortable overnight with my 15 degree bag AND my liner.  I was up, packed and on trail by 7 am.  Beautiful morning - cool, breezy and clear skies.  I enjoyed a pretty sunrise from the American perch where the impromptu group gathered for dinner and the sunset.  I felt well and strong despite the prior day's extreme fatigue at end of the day.  Ran into Michaela and Cuddle, two recent high school grads out for the same adventure.
The morning otherwise was quiet as the trail led us gradually towards Blood Mountain.  Lunch break at Lance Creek where I met and spoke with F & S (section hiking) and Andrew (31 year old ultra-runner who I feel confident will finish and finish long before me).  The afternoon was as social as the morning was quiet with the trail rolling towards our first ""iconic"" stop.  I hiked with Scars & El and Danny (Charleston) through the modest and fair climb up Blood and all the way down the mountain on the most challenging descent of the trip to date - very rocky, very steep, difficult stepping, wet, muddy which was particularly difficult at the end of the day.
Finally arrived at Neel Gap, home of Mountain Crossings outfitter and hostel. We grabbed a cold soft drink, resupply boxes from home and walked .3 miles to Blood Mountain Cabins - where were spent the night with a roof over our heads but not before Josh & Laura (and Goose) drove Scars & El, Livvy, Haillie and me to town for a burger and a beer.

After a couple of hours, the weather deteriorated with the wind, cold and rain increasing requiring rain jacket, rain kilt and eventually gloves.  The rain made a few streams turn into vigorous waterfalls that often covered the trail.  The broad, flat trail turned more irregular and rocky at Chattanooga Gap.  I then climbed Blue Mountain being passed by a young thru-hiker and stopped at the Blue Mountain Shelter (where I spoke with Jim and son Cole).  After a particularly difficult (thus, slow going) decent due to rocks, steepness and wet, I arrived at Unicoi Gap where Spirit Man invited me into his taxi and went to Hiawassee for night.

Windy, clear and below freezing when I started climb out of Unicoi Gap and up Rocky Mountain.  Met Swagman, an April start thru-hiker on climb.  After descending from Rocky Mountain, right up the long climb to summit of Tray Mountain, where I had lunch break and met Hungary Cat.
After those two climbs, I enjoyed a quiet, solitary walk through gentle terrain, making good time on excellent paths.  This continued through the ""Swag of the Blue Ridge.""  (According to an Appalachian Trail Conservancy guide:  ""This area is called a ""swag"" or ""low point"" and is a long, broad ridge crest with only moderate elevation change, extending for more than three miles - among the remotest areas of the Georgia Trial."")
To complete the long, almost 17 mile hike, I had to climb Kelly Knob, which was particularly challenging due to the more directly vertical trail paths (as opposed to more use of switchbacks) and it's time at the end of the day.  No views on Kelly Knob.  After descending somewhat the trail took me to the summit of Powell Mountain where I took a blue-blazed trail to a ""vista"" with beautiful view east illuminated by late afternoon light.
A very long, gradual descent into Dicks Creek Gap followed the Powell Mountain summit.  Swagman had caught up, so he took town shuttle with me.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584446,"The climb north out of the NOC is well documented (in blogs, Trail Journals, YouTube, etc.) as a long, very hard slog out of the deep gap - 3,000 foot ascent from the NOC to Cheoah Bald over 8 miles.  Fortunately, the weather was sunny, clear and cold.  I had the treat of meeting my daughter at the end of the day.  I got an early start and tried to prepare mentally for a tough day.Initially the climb was surprisingly pleasant - I focused on a deliberate pace that was slow but always moving forward without losing my breath.  A great trail brought the hiker up through pine forest pleasant with birds signing (something unknown to thru-hikers on my pace thus far) and the sound of the Nantahala River followed along the trail.  Along under 30 degrees, the hiking was most enjoyable as the trail design offered different experiences, from ridge walks to switching between the sunny and the shaded sides of the hills being climbed, the later offering rock outcroppings dripping in icicles, snow-covered hill sides and tunnels of Rhododendron.Before I knew it I was within striking distance of the day's gem - Cheoah Bald.  Having completed five miles in four hours I was pleased, not because of the pace, but I had thoroughly enjoyed a hike reputed to be unwelcome.  The remaining three miles to Cheoah Bald were tough but the final approach of about a half mile was a killer, among the toughest hikes to date.  There was quite a reward - Cheoach Bald is a grassy summit (just over 5,000 feet) with a broad view of the surrounding mountains.  A group gathered at the bald to enjoy a late lunch, photographs, and the views, including Hungary Cat, Ross, Swagman and a group of three that started from Springer on 2/19.Having not just completed, but enjoyed the infamous climb, it was time to descend to our planned meeting/tenting area - still 2.5 miles north.  Although a bit fatigued, I climbed down about 1,500 feet and reached our camping area about 20 minutes before Brooke showed up.  (She had driven 5 and a half hours and then hiked a tough 3.2 miles south from Stecoah Gap to meet me.)We set up our tents and cooked Chicken Pesto Pasta (Trailtopia), vegetable and Peach Berry Crisp (Trailtopia).  The tenting site was somewhat exposed to the wind and the temperature was dropping, so we had to retreat to our tents and sleeping bags - still amazed and excited that Brooke is visiting for two days/two nights.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584447,"Although predicted, the evening rain never came - yet, it threatened so we packed up quickly.  We had a moderate to tough, 12-mile day planned with a number of climbs.  We (I) got beat up early with an immediate climb and drop into Simp Gap and then a climb out of Simp into Stecoah Gap and then (after a quick water/snack break) out of Stecoah.  (Brooke had done all of the 3.2 miles south from Stecoah the day before.)  The rain did come and we had to battle off an on rain with very cold morning.The first 4 miles were tougher than I thought they'd be, and then we faced ""Jacob's Ladder.""  This proved to be one of my top 5 toughest climbs thus far.  Unlike much of the trails (which utilize switchbacks and other gradual approaches to climbing high summits), the AT at Jacob's Ladder is a direct, frontal attack straight up the vertical.  Ouch.Shortly after completing the difficult climb up Jacob's Ladder, we arrived at Brown Fork Gap Shelter where we took a lunch break.  We were joined by Candyman, Fifty, Hallie and Livvy as well as earlier by Rivers and another thru-hiker.  Having been wiped out for the day, I was glad the rain subsided early and most of the rest of the trail appeared to be downhill.  We still had seven miles to cover.  We saw few hikers during the day, but there were about 6 in the shelter and 6 tenting when we arrived at the shelter area a little bit before 5 pm.  I was beat.  Brooke seemed as though she could have gone farther.We set up our tents (challenging sites), filtered water and cooked dinner, visiting with a 60-year old businessman planning to hike only to Damascus.  As it got darker and colder, we retired to our tents.  Within 30 minutes of getting settled inside the rain came and came very hard.  Whew!  We had gotten the day's work completed without any rain except for the early miles.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584677,"Daylight savings time meant that 7 am was much darker than the day before.  Our tent flys were wet from the evening's rain, some of which was light and intermittent as we were waking.  (Packing without rain is immensely valuable to me.)  Determined to get an early start, we packed up with the assistance of headlamps and, thankfully, no rain interrupted the effort.
We dressed for rain, but nothing came immediately.  Our first hike of the day was a climb so we both were overheated and had to shed a couple of layers.  Overall the hike was about 3 miles of climbing and 4 miles of downhill.  We hoped for a noon arrival so Brooke could get on the road back to Chapel Hill.  We passed one thru-hiker who had tented near us the last two nights, but otherwise did not see other hikers until 4 younger hikers caught us at Fontana Crossing (marina) where we called to arrange our shuttle and enjoyed a vending machine beverage.
The trail was very wet and slick in many places, perhaps from the prior night's rain.  After Fontana Crossing, the hike was pleasant as it followed the lake shore.  A mile and a half later Fontana Crossing, we came upon the famous ""Fontana Hilton"" shelter, on high ground overlooking the lake with picnic tables, seat surrounding a fire ring, running water, and a charging station (and a hundred years away, there are tenting spots, flush toilets, and even a shower with hot water).  Most thru-hikers have heard about this shelter (and seen in YouTube videos), but it was even nicer than my impressions.
After some photos, Brooke and I made our way to our pickup at Fontana Dam.
The Hike Inn picked us up and brought us to my room for the next two nights.
After cleaning up, Brooke drove us into town for a Mexican lunch and chores, including trying to address my malfunctioning iPhone.
Brooke headed off and I settled in for the evening and for my first zero day.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584679,"After a good zero, I headed into the Great Smokies with rest-empowered eagerness.  Most like me who follow thru-hikers on YouTube or Trail Journals, etc. see this step as a major one.  It's almost as if basic training has ended and it's time for combat.  Gadabout (who roomed next to me at Hike Inn for the same two nights) and I got dropped off at Fontana Dam and we were hiking by 7:30 am.  The day was pleasant, partly sunny and cold - very nice for hiking.  Although the day's hike was akin to climbing out of the NOC, the trail brought us up gradually.  (Fontana Dam, at 1,700 feet, is the highest dame in the east.  We were to climb to over 4,700 feet over the 12 miles.)  The morning was uneventful  (I skipped the steep side trail to Shuchstack fire tower because the clouds appeared.  To eliminate any particularly good views.  Scars later confirmed the wisdom of my decision.)  I felt strong and, I think guided by a good mental approach (being prepared for the climb out of the NOC), I eventually reached Mollies Ridge Shelter, where I was reintroduced to and spoke with Maverick 71 as we both prepared lunch.I moved on another 3.3 miles gently uphill and then downhill to Russell Field Shelter at 4,347 feet.  It was quiet at the shelter so I prepared to sleep in it.  A large group from U of South Florida showed up to fill the shelter.  Maverick 71 and his son showed up and tented.  A couple of section hikers with a dog were also tenting (and one was in a hammock).The group was social but the bitter cold drove us to eat quickly and retire to our sleeping bags.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584680,"After my first evening in a shelter, I was again first up and out on the trail.  The morning was clouded in, cold and windy.  The snow was much deeper than the prior day.  The trail headed up from the shelter and the climb became more difficult (due to snow, wind and terrain) as it ascended Rocky Top and then Thunderhead Mountain.  Although the sun suggested it might break through, there were no views other than the white of the snow and the grayness of the close cloud cover.  There was a starkness and almost a forbidding sense created by the lack of color, feeling snow underfoot, the inability to see any distance or perspective, and the bitter cold and wind.  I had not been overtaken, yet, by faster hikers from the shelter - itself unusual.  What most days is enjoyable solitude today felt instead like uncomfortable loneliness.  (It was almost one of those - ""what am I doing out here?"" moments.)The morning ended with a quick, late lunch at Derrick Knob Shelter.  I was happy or relieved to see some familiar faces, Gadabout and other settling in for the day.  The weather had also turned somewhat brighter.I put on my Microspikes (these provided great benefit), gathered myself for a large afternoon push, and took on the last five and a half miles to Silers Bald Shelter.  When I arrived (6:30 - my latest day for hiking), the shelter was generally full - Scars, Nightmare, and El Diablo were there.  I quickly decided to tent - set up, gathered and boiled water, ate a Trailtopia meal, and with the bitter cold closing in on everyone, climbed into my tent and got ready for what I anticipated might be a brutal night.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584682,"After a night of tenting in the snow, I packed up on a cold and windy morning.  I was first out of the shelter where another dozen people spent the night.  This day the objective was Clingman's Bald, the highest point on the AT and the highest point in eastern United States.  After a half an hour of hiking, which allowed me to warm up (and my frozen shoes to thaw), the trail headed up through a forest of hemlock, pine and fir.  I stopped at Double Spring Gap Shelter (1.7 miles) to filter water and grab a breakfast bar (and was met there for the same purposes by El Diablo and Nightmare).
With substantial snow (6 to 10 inches) on the ground and much still clinging to and suspended in trees, the trail was essentially a beautiful tunnel winding upwards towards the summit.  Sauerkraut (and then El Diablo and Nightmare) came by (he described his own nightmare of losing his phone the prior day - and running almost 4 miles south to retrieve it).
The first three or four miles were uphill but the trail brought us up at a reasonable grade.  Views of the surrounding mountains on this clear blue sky day were more frequent than usual.  The snow in the mountains and in the foreground made most vistas especially beautiful.  The day was cold, still below or at freezing, but I was comfortable due to the heat generated by the climb (and I continued to hike in rain pants and jacket (especially good for the wind)).  The last mile or so to the summit was more vertical but I eventually hit the access road (covered still by snow) and made my way the last few hundred yards to the iconic observation tower.
With 35-40 MPH winds and 14 degrees, it was hard to spend much time in the tower, but I took a moment to enjoy the views and take photos and video.  I was told that there are probably only 40 days a year where it's clear atop Clingman's Dome.  I hurried down and ran into Scars heading for the tower.  We spoke.  Both planned to zero in Gatlinburg.  It was too cold to linger so we moved on.
The hike down to Newfound Gap was a substantial descent of seven miles with a few smaller uphill segments along the way.  The trail was beautiful but my pack was feeling particularly heavy and my left hip was hurting some.  The weather warmed mostly from the bright sun and the trail continued to be beautiful.  I ran into a number of day hikers making the 14 mile round trip hike from Newfound Gap to Clingman's Dome.  Scars caught me and hiked on as I tired.  My progress was slow but eventually made it to Newfound Gap.  I caught up with Cheryl for awhile until my shuttle (A Walk in the Woods) arrived.I settled into the Hilton Garden Inn.

I ran into Same, an actor from Harrisonburg, on the summit.  We hiked and lunched together.
We then attacked a long, unexpectedly difficult climbs out of Deep Gap and then out of Brown Gap toward Max Patch and shelter.
I tired from the climbs, but had enough time to reach Roaring Fork Shelter (which would have been a 15.2 mile day, but weather started to set in late afternoon). I set up shelter and was later joined by two older, section hikers.
The rain increased.  I had to set up quickly, but then settled into my tent - very comfortable.  The rain and evening came.

",Stealth Tent site a mile south of Max Patch/Mile 253.7,"Mar 20, Tue",12.30
RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585141,"I woke up to 4 or 5 inches of snow on the ground and covering my tent.  Before the snow, we had rain and then sleet overnight, so my rain fly was covered in ice.  I packed up and headed out (no motion or sound from the other two tents).  The first ""highlight"" was Max Patch - among the more famous places on the AT.
The weather was still challenging with strong winds and snow still falling.  It was far from ideal weather to cross an open bald where then wind gusts got to almost 50 MPH, but I really had no where else to go so I forged ahead.  It was stark, windy, and very old with heavy snow blowing horizontally.  Visibility was only a few hundred feet so with my head down I pressed on, steeply at the end through 6 or 8 inches of snow and then following white-blazed posts, I made my way to and across the famous bald.
After Max Patch, I gained the cover of trees, although the wind and snow continued at a significant pace.  I was able to move relatively quickly to Roaring Fork Shelter, where I had planned to camp the night before.  I saw Finnegan there as well as three spring college women heading southbound, eager to get to their cars at Max Patch.  From Roaring Fork, the trail descending to Lemon Gap, 3 and a half miles away.  That trail was covered with 8 inches of snow, but was a pleasant walk through rhododendron as well as along and crossing many streams that were never out of earshot.
A steep climb up Walnut Mountain, made considerably harder by the accumulating snow, brought me to a shelter after a mile and a half climb.  It was decision time for me.  I had decided to make my way here and then, depending on the time, the progress I had made, the weather, and how I felt, I would stay at the Walnut Mountain Shelter for the night or I would move on.
It was 1 - 1:30 pm.  I couldn't fact lying in the shelter for 18 hours, especially with the wind seemingly whipping over the ridge upon which the 5-person shelter sat.  As I snacked on GORP, I weighed my options - none of which were great:  the next shelter was ""a bridge too far"" (10 miles, more than I thought I could possibly go), waiting in the shelter might make subsequent days more difficult (potentially stranding me in the woods), I would have to find a tenting site in 10 inches of snow.
When I left the shelter at 1:30, I knew I would have to find a tent site that night, but I was eager to get off the cold windy ridge and get some miles closer to Hot Springs.  I thought it would be more hospitable at lower elevations but to do that I had to get over Bluff Mountain.
The descent from Walnut Mountain was relatively fast as the grade allowed me to move quickly - I was almost skiing down the trail.  Then came the ascent of Bluff, which was tough enough without the wind, cold and snow.  With almost a half a mile to go to the summit, the trail was obliterated by the blowing wind and accumulating drifts.  As I tried to continue the climb, I was plowing through drifts on the trail at or above my knees.  I knew that after I summited Bluff, I need to get to a lower elevation and find a tenting spot.
I made good time descending, but the snow and wind continued.  Accumulations were now around 10 inches.  My guide suggested a couple of sites but I missed them or wasn't convinced they would be the best option.  I was coming down the mountain but not finding a solution.  Finally, I realized that I would come to a road.  Perhaps there would be a reasonable tenting spot even if near the road.  Then I thought I might be able to get a shuttle if I was at a road crossing.
I got picked up by John the shuttle driver - a trail angel even though I was paying him.
Suddenly an amazingly difficult and challenging (and nearly frightening) day concluded with a room at the Mountain Magnolia Inn.

After shuttle by Yaya, I started at 8:45.  Perfect morning.  Easy climb for first mile.  Bright blue sky.  Had to remove Microspikes because underfoot was too soft - clumping up in my spikes.  Sun and increasing warmth sorted trail.  Beautiful modest walk through snow covered trees with reasonably good views of surrounding mountains.  I arrived at shelter (halfway point) right at 10:30, which was followed by the only real climb of the day.  Then downhill into Hot Springs.  I got back to Mountain Magnolia Inn right at noon and quickly transferred my gear to Elmer's Sunnybank Inn.
Rest of day was zero in town and back at Inn.  Saw Scars at library.  Did some trustee work and planning for trip to Erwin.
Enjoyed communal, vegetarian dinner with Elmer, Matt, Peaks and two other thru-hikers.  Dinner topic:  If you could, which of man's technologies would you eliminate?

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585627,"When I arrived at the shelter I described the day as having four parts:Very pleasant yet grey morning; excellent trail that brought us up in elevation (2,500 feet over six miles) in a remarkably easy (I suggested easier than ever, but maybe I just felt strong that morning).  A bunch of us had a snack at the first shelter, which was just three miles into the day.Part two was after most of the days vertical climb and we crossed over to a more sun-exposed ridge and the trail became nothing but an ever changing mixture of snow, ice, deep mud or running water (from the snow melt and prior evening's torrential rain), much of the trail was now just streams of water following gravity and the path of least resistance.  It was impossible to keep your feet dry.Midday we hit section three - a high, rock ridge/ledge that went on for 2.5 miles.  Typically this would have been a fun challenge working our way through modest ups and downs through rock outcroppings highlighted by great views, but with the visibility near zero and the rock ledges covered by snow and ice, the going was both slow and precarious.  An alternative route is offered for ""bad weather,"" which in hindsight I wish I took.  With the views eliminated, the only thing left of this section would be the fun of navigating the rock formations, but the snow/ice eliminated the fun from my perspective, leaving just a difficult ordeal.Part 4 - I arrived at Jerry Cabin shelter at 2 pm, much later than expected.  It was a potential stop for the day and a couple of guys I was with made that decision.  I wanted to tent but everything was still snow-covered (not that that hasn't stopped me before) and I really wanted to get some more miles in.  I decided to push on another 6 miles despite the hour, hoping for brightening sky and better tenting at lower elevations.  Thankfully I was rewarded with both even though the late afternoon hike was mostly a never ending, boring but gradual descent.Arrived a little after 6 pm.  Good tenting sites.  Busy shelter.  Milder temperatures allowed some socializing over my Beef Stroganoff and vegetables.BHM

Before I knew it I had climbed the three miles to Big Bald, which was a very large bald - meaning it was a massive meadow on the top of the mountain, at 5,516 feet.  Unfortunately, the clouds remained close and the wind blew fiercely.  The sun seemed to want to break through, but no luck.  Despite the lack of views and the weather, I enjoyed the ""tour"" around the bald created by the route taken by the AT across it.
Coming off of the summit, the trail descending gently on a good footpath all the way to Bald Mountain shelter and beyond.  I caught a few minutes with Cheryl on the phone before we lost reception.  The descent was fast due to good conditions and modest downhills.  Halfway down the sun came out from time to time and the surrounding mountains began to reveal themselves.  Later in the afternoon, the temperature rose with the sun.  I ran into Ladybug & Stickers (from dinner at Elmer's) as well as Easily Forgotten & Bunny Tracks.
Met Mike at Spivey Gap, but before that ran into Traveler (Will), who was waiting on a shuttle from Uncle Johnny's - he had hurt his knee badly.
Back to farm.  Caught up on planning and journaling.  Spoke with Ned.  Spoke with Cheryl.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585799,"I started hiking at the Nolichucky River before 8:00 a.m.
The trail followed the river for a mile or so on a high ridge overlooking the Nolichucky.  The trail then followed some beautiful, mountain streams through thick rhododendrons in a gentle climb as we started up towards the Beauty Spot.  Despite the map profile, the grade of the trail was excellent as it brought us up vertically with relative ease however the footpath itself was substantially more rocky and rooty than the trails leading into Hot Springs.
I ran into Knee Deep, his nephew, and his nephew's daughter Rachel and enjoyed morning break with them at Curly Maple shelter.  Then began a long, steady climb up to the Beauty Spot (another famous bald on the AT).  About halfway, at Indian Grove Gap, we were treated to trail magic by Brother T - brownies, zucchini bread, fruit and cold drinks.  And I got to sit around in the sun in real chairs and socialize with Snowcone, Lifesaver, Donut, Knee Deep's family and later Traveler showed up.
Energized by our trail magic break, we headed up the final 3 plus miles to the Beauty Spot.  The weather was still good so we had some great views.  Most of us tented a short distance down the hill, returned to the Beauty Spot for sunset (but the clouds overtook the sunset) and then enjoyed a real campfire back at the campsite before turning in.  Another great day.
The day was among the nicest the entire trip for hiking partly - sunny, mid-50s and very pleasant breezes.  I only broke a sweat climbing the steep portions of the trail.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586300,"I packed and left camp first again on a cold, misty, grey morning.  After an hour or so it began to really rain.  I climbed Unaka Mountain (known for its ""dense spruce mountain top forest"") in pea soup and cold rain.  Although distracted by the weather and the challenging climb, I did note that the ascent offered layers of vegetation as I moved through hardwood/rhododendron forest, a layer of evergreens, then low bushes/grassland (almost like a bald), and finally the promised dense spruce forest.  It probably is quite pleasant and interesting in dry, mild weather, but I needed to keep moving.The descent was difficult and unenjoyable - not only was it interminably long, but the trail often was nothing but rocks and a flowing stream.  I was happy to put Unaka Mountain behind me.  Shortly thereafter I reached Cherry Gap shelter where I cooked oatmeal and a hot beverage.  I was joined by Snowcone, Lifesaver, Traveler, Pit Bull and Play by Play.  After 15-20 minutes it was too cold to linger, so off I went.The rest of the day was a series of short climbs and short descents - somewhat pointless.  There was nothing notable to see, but considering how cold and rainy it was no one was picking their head up much to look around.  The sum seemed to want to come out, but then we'd get a shower of sleet.  The only thing that truly brightened up the day was trail magic (quesadillas, cupcakes, fruit and a variety of cold drinks (including a sip of apple cinnamon moonshine)) provided by Chef, Tamborine and MoFo.I was very glad to end a generally unpleasant day by setting up my tent (many excellent sites) at Clyde Smith shelter.  Just to remind us of the day's struggles, the water source was a long way away down a steep hill.  It remained bitter.  We (Traveler, Snowcone, Lifesaver, etc. - Pit Boss and Play by Play has gone to Greasey Creek) cooked and ate quickly.  I met Vagabon Jack (and Kirb, who is hiking with Jack) and sent Mighty Blue a photo of us.  The cold drove me into my tent before 7:00 p.m.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586301,"I was up, packed and out by 7:45 on a beautiful morning with the sun rising to my right and a near full moon setting to my left.  The night had been below freezing with some light rain so I packed up a wet rain fly another morning.  It was too cold to try to cook and socialize, so I decided to get going from the busy shelter site (6 tents and a dozen in the shelter, including Eddie & Rumi, Traveler, Snowcone & Lifesaver, Vagabon Jack, and Kirb.The day looked like a challenging one with a 6-mile climb up the old Cloudland Hotel site.  I tried to prepare and planned a three part day:  warm up by knocking off the first 4 miles that precede the vertical climb (and have breakfast there - Hughes Gap), tackle half the climb (and take lunch break at Ash Gap) and then finish the big climb (and from there it was a couple of miles downhill to Carvers Gap) -- and fortunately that's just what I did.We then hit the ascent it proved to be easier than the map profile over a great foot tread and modest grades for the amount of elevation gained.  A modest descent into Ash Gap was my intended lunch break spot due to its (conveniently) location halfway on the climb and the availability of water.  I joined two guys from New Jersey out for a week for a pleasant lunch - again the milder weather permitting us to sit around for more than 10 minutes.Then it was time for the final ascent.  The trail was interesting in that it wound through an evergreen forest, around rock outcroppings, and along a rocky ridge.  Before I knew it the trail spilled us out into a mini-bald and the former site of an upscale, 1880's mountain top hotel known as the Cloudland Hotel with some good views and rhododendron gardens.The balance of the hiking day was a little over two miles down to Carver's Gap mostly on the old road that brought people to the old hotel and was not full of day hikers on a beautiful Easter weekend Saturday.  Like my climb out of the NOC, I turned a day that some dreaded into a most pleasant hike.  That said, I did not enjoy the final two miles into Carver's Gap because the trail was nothing but football, baseball, and golf ball size rocks, which constantly jar your feet as the angular stones force your feet in different directions or cause you to roll your feet from time to time in unexpected directions.I finally arrived at Carver's Gap, which was buzzing with activity.  I was 45 minutes early for my ride so I dried my tent and relaxed in the sun.  Brent & Juanita arrived, took me into town for some shopping and a pizza to go, and then brought me to Roane Mountain B&B.  Ann and Steve Campbell (proprietors) arrived after I had dinner.  We socialized and I spoke with Cheryl.  A very good day.BHM

It was a fairly warm, long day of relatively modest ups and downs.  I saw very few hikers on trail all day and other than the falls there were not any particular points of interest or views.  I finally made it to the shelter a little before 7 pm.  The only other hikers there were Sleeves and Crocket.

Sleeves and I got going around 7:30.  The morning was cold and there was a light rain.  After an initial climb, the trail was mostly downhill as we headed for Dennis Cove Road and Laurel Falls.  The morning weather worsened resulting in a very windy, rainy and cold three-hour hike.  Things eased as I approached Dennis Cove and the forecast showed a sunny afternoon.
I stopped for lunch well before the falls hoping to give some time to let the sky clear.  I made my way down along Laurel Fork, into Laurel Gorge and down to the magnificent Laurel Falls.  After enjoying the Laurel area with its running mountain streams, deep rocky gorge, powerful falls, rhododendron gardens, and rock outcroppings, I had one long climb (""Pond Flats"") remaining for the day - three miles up and three miles down.
It was a difficult climb - steep and rocky; and seemingly endless.  Fortunately when I finally reached the top, the descent was fast over a pleasant foot tread.  After a short side trip, I checked into Boots Off Hostel and shared a cabin with Scars.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586477,"[This section was hiked southbound from TN 91.]
After an early morning shuttle, Not Today, Zzz and I started hiking at the AT trailhead at TN State Route 91.  It was a cool, clear morning - perfect for hiking.  We moved fairly quickly over moderately grade terrain.  After almost 4 miles, we stopped at Iron Mountain shelter for a quick snack/break.  We met Inside-Out and visited with Eddie Steady & Rumi, Crafty and Sauerkraut there.
The rest of the morning was mostly following a high ridge that led generally down to Lake Wautuga, but rolled up and down in an almost regular series.  We ran into Sleeves, Professor, Crockett, Play-by-Play & Pit Boxx, and a few others hiking northbound.
We stopped for a short lunch break at the shelter and then moved on to complete the long day.  After that break, most of the hike was downhill with increasingly good views of Lake Wautuga on a still pristine day.  Temperatures were great for hiking although typically our hands would get cold whenever we stopped.
There was a particularly steep downhill (addressed by multiple switchbacks) before Wilbur Dam Road followed by a mile plus road walk down to the dam.  After some photos there, we finished the last three miles by circling the lakeshore to the public road where Zzz's mom waited with cold drinks, chips, and donuts.
I walked the last short piece to Boots Off where I found:  Stickers & Ladybug, Donut, Dimples, Easily Forgotten & BunnyTracks, Kirb, Vagabond Jack and Scars - the first four listed were planning a 40-mile dash to Damascus in the morning.  Scars, Dimples and I caught a quick shuttle into town for dinner.

The day began sunny, cool and beautiful.  We took on and kept a faster than usual pace over reasonably easy terrain characterized by rolling up and down numerous knobs.  There were few notable views (just the usual broad looks at surrounding hills through the trees) as we followed a single ridge on our way to Virginia.
After an aggressive morning, we finally stopped at Abington Gap shelter for a brief lunch break.  We left the shelter a little after 1:00 and began the final 10 miles.  With very few uphill climbs and good conversation, the next 7 miles flew by - my fastest pace of entire trip.  With 3 miles to go, we hit the TN-VA border.  We coasted into Damascus before 5:00 just as slight rain began.  This is a big landmark and we were excited to arrive.
We quickly made our way to Old Mill and then dinner at MoJo's (Hokie Pokie, Hungry Cat and Professor).

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587010,"A beautiful sunrise helped start a big day for me - I was climbing both Whitetop Mountain and Mt. Rogers, seeing the famous Grayson Highlands, and meeting my old college friend, Randy Storm.  The night had been so cold I couldn't sleep without my balaclava.
After an hour of flat or modest descent, the day's climb of 2,000 feet began.  The ascent was reasonable but long as the sun tried to clear the morning sky.  It was cold and windy.  Eventually I came to an uphill grassy clearing that reminded me of the introduction to Big Bald.  The view up to Buzzard Rock and beyond to Whitetop was exhilarating with the frosted grass and trees, strong cross winds, and the blue sky fighting to breakthrough.
Shortly thereafter I was following Play by Play and Pit Boss straight down 1.6.  They expected trail magic from Grumpy and Gucci Girl, who finally showed after we finished lunch.  I was getting cold so it did not make sense to hang out.  I got a Snickers bar and headed out to climb Mt. Rogers.
The weather was improving - the sky was clearing.  I was excited as I made the relatively easy climb because it also meant I'd be entering the Grayson Highlands - one of the universally loved spots on the AT.  The trail was rocky.  Snow and ice remained in the shaded areas.  The going was slow.
After passing by the Thomas Knob shelter the trail teases the hiker with glimpses of the highlands but both hug the edge of the meadows and ducks in and out of the woods bordering.  Eventually the broad views of the grassy highlands (Virginia's answer to the ""balds"" in NC and TN) and the surrounding mountains were revealed.  The afternoon was near perfect in sky and temperature.  I saw some of the wild ponies and took in the fabulous views as the afternoon light lengthened - and I openly gave thanks for the day.
The trail was often challenging due to an abundance of rocks on the trail and outcroppings to be climbed, which included The Cliffs and the ""Fatman Squeeze.""
I was scheduled to meet Randy Storm, my college roommate and canoe partner at Massie Gap, just north of the highlands, but I was running late due to the challenge of climbing Whitetop and Mt. Rogers and especially due to the rocky trails in descending from those heights.
Because I was an hour behind schedule, Randy had begun to hike south, which gave him a chance to enjoy the highlands as well, including some wild ponies.
Randy and I made our way a few more miles and tented/camped with friends at Wise shelter:  Scars, Sleeves, Odie (SOBO), Crockett, Footloose, Donut, Pit Boss, Professor and Play by Play.

It snowed on and off and remained cold.  Midday it eased up and appear that sky might be clearing again but early afternoon it started to snow again and remain very cold.  The trail was in excellent shape - much less rocky.  Yet, due to the eater and the lack of views, it was a ""keep your head down and make miles"" day.  (Much like the day before.)  Due to the prior day's rains, it was noticeable how swollen and vigorous the mountain streams and creeks were.  In fact, for the first time I had trouble finding a way to cross over a creek because the primary way was flooded.
Towards the late afternoon the snow picked up and the day became bitter cold.  Consolation for the day was that the terrain was among the easiest in terms of topography of any day on the trail yet.  In fact, there was a stretch where the trail followed an old forest road for two or three miles and the trail was almost perfectly flat.  The day finished with a seemingly never ending series of small climbs followed by a turn and a dip, over and over, until we came to a gravel road.  We had a 0.6 mile road walk to US 52 and Brushy Mountain Outpost, where we enjoyed burgers until a shuttle to the motel.  It was nice to be out of the snow and bitter cold for the night as I shared a room with Pit Boss and Play by Play.

After an hour Pit Boss and Play by Play moved on at a faster pace and I settled in for an easier, relaxing day.  The trail was excellent and relatively easy all day as we stayed atop a ridge most of the day.  I ran into and spoke with Turtle and two section hikers going SOBO as well as Teatime and Peak, also going SOBO (started in Duncannon).  I did an interview with Mighty Blue for the podcast.
Overall it was a quiet, pleasant day of easy hiking.  I made it to the shelter around 5 pm.  Pit Boss and Play by Play were there.  Shocktock joined female section hiker.  And late a foreign hiker who did not speak English also tented.
The evening was reasonably warm so we could eat and socialize for awhile, but the cold drove us in by 7:30 pm.

It was a long descent to Pearisburg - a bit steep at times, a bit rocky at times - I finished with a road walk into town and a stop at the Mexican restaurant, but just before that I joined Play by Play, Pit Boss, Rumi & Eddie Steady at Dairy Queen.
Finally made my way to Angel's Rest hostel.  Sleeves was in the room next to me.  (I thought he was far north - amazing how so many hikers surge in and out and back in just when you think you'll never see them again.)

The climb out of Stoney Creek up to Bailey Gap shelter was unexpectedly difficult!  It reminded briefly of Jacobs Ladder.  I cooked a late lunch at the shelter and then headed off for Wind Rock.  The trail was very rocky and slow going - and not fun.  I saw no one but two older gentlemen with just day packs ""thru-hiking"" by using two vehicles and walking towards each other and swapping car keys.  The rain started out lightly but 45 minutes before I reached camp it picked up, so I had to setup the tent quickly.  I got my gear inside, settled in, warmed up and spent the late afternoon and early evening listening to the rain and wind and working on my journal.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588916,"Day of varied experiences.  Initially a short but tough climb up on old abandoned, rocky forest road.  Then an easy walk down to shelter where I ran into and hiked with Sleeves for a while.  Stopped at Laurel Creek shelter and had lunch - joined by Shortcutz (podcast fan), Stretch and then Packmule and Finash.
Immediately after the shelter there were two, very difficult creek crossings due to the flooding of the creeks - it took 15 to 20 minutes and some ingenuity (and some scary steps) to navigate a 15-yard crossing.  I then enjoyed a beautiful hike (down to Sinking Creek/US 42) along a pine needle floor through a mixed forest of hardwoods and evergreens, including much new, low growth and mountain laurels.  It was dramatically more pleasant than the previous day's hike through similar forests devastated by gypsy moths and a fairly recent forest fire.  The AT here followed a ridge and, not surprisingly, due to the presence of the evergreens and pine needle path is called Piney Ridge.
After crossing US 42, I ran into Riddle and Liddle (now, Sink and Shivers) picking up their bear bag hung four days earlier.  We then came across the Keffer Oak before attacking the toughest climb of the day - 2 miles up, which was followed by very flat and pleasant ridge walking.  Ran into Fun Facts and Not Dead.  This was followed by a very lengthy stretch of difficult and very angular ridge rocks.  This area was frustrating and slow.  I fell from sliding on flat, wet rock.  I was irritated, probably because I was tiring.  That said, it would have been essentially impassable on a raining day like two days prior. (Scars reported that Footloose took two very hard falls in this stretch on those days.)
Finally, the rocks ended and I still had two miles downhill to the shelter.  I arrived a little after 7 pm, my latest hiking day.  Double Vision, Armor and a few others there.  Tented, filtered water, cooked/ate and retired quickly.  Stretch and Shortcutz moved on.  Sink and Shivers arrived after dark.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588928,"Up at 6:00 am.  Packed and hiked 1.4 miles to meet Mike Hastings.  Beautiful day in all respects.  We had an immediate and significant uphill right away.  I set a steady and deliberate pace.  The trail design and condition were exceptional.  Before we knew it we had made the climb and we were at the Audie Murphy Memorial.  From there the trail was as wide, grassy/earthen and flat as any part of the trail prior.  We eventually made a long descent to Trout Creek where Mike and I had lunch before heading straight back up again.
The climb was again very manageable with many great views of the surrounding mountains and farmland as we headed for Dragons Tooth, the day's highlight and one of the iconic points of interest on the AT.  Getting to Dragons Tooth required ridge walking around and through various rock formations that were somewhat challenging at times but not as dangerous as the rocks/ridgeline above Niday shelter the prior day.  The climb down from Dragons Tooth was very difficult and working through the rocks (and constantly trying to ease ourselves down steep terrain) continued for a considerable period.  And, after we thought we were through, they started again along a piney ridge of rocks and pine needles.  It tried our patience but eventually arrived where Mary was waiting for us (just 5 minutes late).
We headed over the The Homeplace for dinner - a well-known hiker stop.  I was greeted by an amazing number of fellow hikers already there:  Shortcutz, Stretch, Pit Bull, Play by Play, Sleeves, and others.  Back to Hastings home for evening.

I planned to lunch at the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, but my back started hurting, the day got warmer and I needed a meal sooner, so I found a spot to have peanut butter tortilla, mangos and a Snickers.  I noticed I had good cell coverage, so I did an interview for the podcast with Mighty Blue.  I pressed out almost another hour and finally saw the white globe of the FAA tower atop Apple Orchard Mountain.  I was hot, tired and my back hurt.  Fortunately, I only had about four more miles to complete the day.  It had been tough and lonely day - finally ran into a section hiker at Thunder Hill shelter when I stopped for water.
I had a brief stop at Thunder Ridge Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway, but views to valley west showed a fairly thick haze.  Tired, I made my way to the tenting area by 5:00 pm.  I was alone and expected to tent alone, but Slider came in to tent.  The bugs - which really showed themselves for the first time in 68 days - chased me into my tent.  Then a large crowd showed up - most of the gang I tented with near Bobblets Gap two nights ago.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590564,"I was up and out by 7:00 am. It was already very warm for that hour. The initial hike was easy but I was having trouble getting my pack to ride comfortably - just as yesterday. It was like a reluctant pack mule - my back kicked and resisted but eventually seemed to settle in and accept the load later in the day.
There was one reasonably big climb (up Highcock Knob), which proved to be even tougher than suggested because it was more vertical rather than gradual (the climbed lacked switchbacks). Even at 9:00 am I was sweating a lot.
Determined not to let my back ruin my thru-hike I wanted to rest it sooner rather than later so I decided to have a short day into the Glasgow hostel and to do a slackpack the following day. I ran into Blueberry & Pickle and Eskimo during a water/lunch break. Otherwise, it was a quiet day.
The balance of my day was descending to the James River and enjoying a flat hike along that River to the foot bridge (actually named after ""Mr. Foot,"" a long time trail volunteer) - well-recognized on the Trail as it is the longest foot-traffic-only bridge on the AT (and a favorite spot for thru-hikers to jump off the bridge and into the river).
After crossing the ""iconic"" bridge - which in person was much larger than I had thought from photos and YouTube videos - I was greeted by trail magic (cold drink and a comfortable chair). Thirty minutes later, Stanimal's hostel picked me up. Only three senior Gus staying there - Granite Man and BigFoot (section hiker).

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590565,"[This section was hiked southbound and is described that way.]
The trail immediately headed downhill on pleasant packed earth and pine needles first to the shelter and then to a small ""valley"" that was settled by freed slaves. The trail followed a beautiful stream and eventually lead to a reservoir that reminded me of New England, especially CT, MA, and ME. Hiking southbound I ran into most in my ""bubble"" including Stretch, Shortcutz, Colonial, Sleeves and Fun Facts' tramily.
The pleasant, easy morning hike ended after around 6 miles as I approached the big climbs of the day up Punchbowl Mountain and ultimately, Bluff Mountain. For me ""Bluff Mountain"" will always have a vivid memory of me fighting blizzard conditions including snow drifting to my knees. Even a beautifully designed and pleasant path on a relatively nice day could alter the image and experience that is conjured up when I read or hear ""Bluff Mountain"" even though the winter scene was weeks ago outside of Hot Springs, NC.
The hike up was remarkably easy and pleasant considering the mountain's profile. I ran into Pit Boss and Play by Play and at the summit, Professor (Moose had gotten off the Trail, having completed the 300 mile section planned). After the summit, where we enjoyed nice views, the day was a dash across the top of the mountain and a lengthy descent back to the James River, which was uneventful except for additional beautiful views. I finished the 21 mile day just before 7:00 pm shuttle to hostel and dinner at Scotto's in Glasgow.

I rolled into Spy Rock Road to meet Sleeves, who hiked down the road with me to meet Wally and Ned.  We had a good dinner at Devils Backbone and then went to Quality Inn in Waynesboro.BHM

*****
After breakfast at the Quality Inn with Sleeves, Ned and Wally, I had a Mighty Blue interview.  We then drove to Loft Mountain campground and set up our tents.  
Ned drops us at Mile 877 and we hiked north back to Loft Mountain.
Despite the forecast, the weather remained fine and we avoided any rain.  We immediately experienced the great quality of the trails in the Shenandoah as well as exceptional trail design.
We reached Loft Mountain in time to enjoy burgers and blackberry milkshakes for dinner.

The next six miles rolled through woodland without any views or points of interest except we were able to have lunch at Lewis Mountain campground.  After climbing Bearfence Mountain, Wally waited for a ride at a Skyline Drive parking lot and I finished the last 6 miles by myself.  The afternoon changed back to the brilliant sky with a cool breeze - wonderful conditions for the hike.  The late afternoon light seemed to help illuminate the wildflowers.  I made very good time on an excellent trail.
We tented at Big Meadows campground.  Wally had been able to buy some wine, which we enjoyed with our Trailtopia.

By noon we were climbing up to Skyland resort where motel rooms awaited.  That climb was surprisingly long and somewhat vertical, but on an excellent trail again.  After lunch at its restaurant, we were able to check in early.  We enjoyed a “nero” by taking the afternoon off, which included some naps.
We finished the day at the restaurant with Atlas – enjoying the sunset and celebrating his 61st birthday.  After dinner we were able to listen to a local singer in the lounge play old 70’s guitar standards.

 While only 10 miles, the hike included two pretty good ascents and a long, difficult climb down into Thornton Gap.  The day was again beautiful, but perhaps a little warm.  We did enjoy a morning break at a beautiful picnic spot (Pinnacles) on the Skyline Drive, some great rock outcroppings and other formations during the hike as well as many nice views of the valley.  The descent from Mary’s Rock was steep and rocky at times – so pretty slow going.  Even with that we were only ten minutes late for our pickup by Rob, who returned us to Skyland to retrieve our gear and enjoy lunch.
We then drove down into the Shenandoah Valley to our B&B destination and had a great time with friends and partners.
As planned – I would now be off the trail for a week.

When Saturday rolled around it was apparent I was not ready, so I spent the better part of the day organizing and packing.  Eventually Cheryl and I made the 2 1/2 hour drive back to the northern Shenandoah.  The top of the ridge was in clouds and rain threatened.  We said goodbye and I headed off.  I only had 2 miles to hike.  All went fine.  I tented at Pass Mountain shelter with a good group of section and thru hikers, none of whom were known to me previously.
It did not feel odd to be back.  It was amazing how the undergrowth in the woods and the leaves on the trees had come out so significantly in just the week I was gone.  I guess that’s what 5 days of rain (amazing I was off the trail for this horrendous weather week) and warmth will do.

I had a hot but uneventful afternoon.  Listened some to Great Courses.  Many day hikers and short term hikers on the AT.  I arrived at shelter around 4:00 and got setup and then tried to cool down.  Most from prior night showed up and tented – somewhat challenging sites but otherwise a very good shelter area.  I cooked and ate with Easy Pete, Irish Paul, Freebird, Virgil, Badass Betty and a father/son out for the weekend.  Also met Little Blue (who had listened to podcast, as had Easy Pete and Irish Paul).
Very busy/crowded shelter area tonight.  Late arrivals setting up tents in very challenging places.
Great conversation around the picnic table – mild night and no real bugs yet.  Headed to bed later than usual and did some journaling.

I was first out on a beautiful morning, although the temperature at 7 am suggested it would be a hot day.  Hiking was pleasant on good trails and no particularly difficult climbs or descents.  Fairly early on we had a great view west as the sun was still fairly low in the east.  Overall the trail was easy with a long moderate downhill.  The Skyline Drive was present throughout the day – numerous crossings and parking lots as well as road noise nearby.  Perhaps related to this omnipresence was numerous day hikers.  I had a great conversation during my lunch break with a Buckeye who begins his SOBO hike from Katahdin in two weeks.  I saw most of the group from the shelter the previous night while hiking.  Geo and Summit caught the trolley with me.  Badass Betty, Virgil and Freebird missed the shuttle.  (I had to keep up a strong pace the last hour to be on time.)  I was welcomed by trail magic at U.S. 522 – where I had done trail magic when I met Rowdy at the trail.

The middle part of the day was relatively easy and the sun tried to burn through, however, the trail often was extremely muddy from the prior week’s excessive rain.  We concluded the morning’s hike with a modest climb up to a field with a bench where we stopped for lunch.  Tallboy came by then,  otherwise we only saw a couple of weekend hikers all day.
The sun peaked out at lunch and a few times in the afternoon.  There were few points of interest (we passed under I-66) but we had good conversation most of the day.  Thunderstorms were forecast for mid to late afternoon.  We targeted arrival at the shelter around 5:00 and set pace to hopefully be in camp before any thunder/lightening.  We heard rumblings but rain, etc. never came although we made it to the (brand new) shelter right at 5:00.
Freebird and I setup our tents and then joined Tallboy, Betty and three section hikers at the shelter for dinner.  I spoke with Cheryl briefly and went to bed.  Brief rain was forecasted (but never materialized).

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592352,"Freebird, Betty and I decided to hike together and try to do 18 miles and finish at Bears Den hostel.  We knew it would be a long day, so we started at 7:00 am.
We handled the first 8 miles fairly well.  We took lunch break just before the start of the “Roller Coaster.”  The discussion at the shelter the night before was – “the Roller Coaster isn’t as bad as its reputation.”  That was good to hear.  The Roller Coaster is a 13.5 mile long series of continuous ups and downs – some will say more mental than physical because each descent rolls right into another ascent.
It only took two “hills” for me to conclude that we had received bad intel.  The first two PUDS (“pointless ups and downs”) were more akin to mountain climbs in Georgia.  They were significant elevation gains and quite vertical both climbing and descending.  Stated simply, they kicked my ass – and we were far from finished.  Next was another ascent, which looked vertical on Guthook, but proved to be reasonable and included a nice view where we took photos with a father and son who had been at shelter with us the previous night.  And, on the descent we celebrated Mile 1,000.  Unfortunately this more “pleasant” climb did not repeat and we continued to “roll” through the PUDS.
Finally we were approaching the shelter, which is 2.5 miles before the hostel.  Betty wondered if she should stop there.  Before reaching it however there was a very steep climb and equally steep descent – I was tired and fed up with the steepness of the hill and the incessant rocks.  For what I think was the first time during the hike, I questioned whether I was having fun and wanted to go on.
Freebird and Betty likewise were beat.  We took a short break.  Now we had under 2 miles to go, but most was a tough climb up to the hostel.  We put our legs in overdrive and made our way up to the hostel.  Tired and grateful to be there, even though it was 8:00 pm, we checked in, had showers, pizza and ice cream, and headed to bed.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593327,"Today might be called a day of smelling the roses.  I had said that after Harper’s Ferry I wanted to be a bit more spontaneous and less tied to a schedule.  Today seemed to be that kind of day.
I got going later than I wanted.  It was a humid morning.  (The night before was uncomfortably warm.  I really only got to sleep well after midnight when the rain seemed to drop the temperature by about 10 degrees.)  After a fairly easy two miles I reached a state park with the original Washington Monument.  Although I was early, a very large group of young girls were up and active at their tent site.  I took my time visiting the monument and watched the fog clear for the view from the top of the monument and ate some breakfast.
After descending the trail was pleasant.  I ran into a ridgerunner and stopped to talk.  I then crossed over a loud I-70 followed by a pretty good climb up towards the Pine Knob shelter and Annapolis Rocks – a very popular and therefore wide/worn trail.  I ran into a PATC trail maintenance volunteer doing some work and then another ridge runner, and spent some time speaking with each of them.
The trail was crowded with weekend and day hikers (Memorial Day Sunday).  I ran into and spoke with a couple of Boy Scout leaders and many day hikers (including two similar aged couples who were very  interested in the hike and very encouraging as well as three ladies from Annapolis, who fed me lunch at Black Rock Cliffs).
Although I didn’t make good time in the morning because of my leisurely pace, the afternoon trail was easy and I was able to make good time.  (The trail in Maryland generally is three times as wide as most trails south of Harper’s Ferry.)  In a sense, my day of smelling roses was rewarded – I still stayed “on schedule” to arrive at my planned destination timely.
Finally, I had a very tough climb up to shelter, but there were some familiar faces (Irish Paul, Phin, Loner Bohner) and good tenting spaces.  I had copious leftovers (chicken salad, salami, Manchego, rolls) from lunch (the ladies had insisted I take) for dinner.  Fortunately, it was cooler and I slept well.

While taking down my tent around 6:30 I looked up to see a 400 pound bear lumbering over to me.  It was 20 yards away so I yelled “hey there!”  The bear looked up, saw me and turned around.  Since I was taking down my tent I didn’t have my phone/camera handy.
I headed out around 7:15.  After an hour or so I ran into Loner and we worked through a very difficult stretch of rocks, including a steep descent through the same jumble of rocks.  This is Loner’s 4th AT thru-hike.  He did tell me that nothing in PA was any harder than this section of rocks.  Then we had a very smooth and level path into Pen-Mar Park, which was quiet for Memorial Day (probably due to 9:00 hour).  I had an early lunch of chicken salad, cheese and salami (still enjoying leftovers) and visited with Irish, Phin, and Mojave.
Like yesterday, I noted that this is certainly not a wilderness hike as we go through Maryland or now Pennsylvania.  We cross many roads, often hear road noise and have already passed through four or five public parks/picnic areas.  I don’t view this omnipresence or these encounters with civilization as negative, just different.
The day was cloudy and threatening, but we had little other than some mist and drizzle.  The next run all the way to Trumbling Run shelter and Old Forge Picnic Ground went quickly on a very nice, easily descending trail.  I took a break and had a second lunch, resupplied water, and called Cheryl from Old Forge, which was very quiet considering it was Memorial Day.
The toughest climb of the day was next.  Remarkably!  I was ahead of schedule and now knew that my planned 20-mile day would be fine even with the fairly long ascent, which I handled without incident, but not without a lot of sweat and a water break midway – where Irish and Phin caught me.  They convinced me to go farther and have dinner at Timbers (also highly recommended by the ridgerunner) and stay at Trail of Hope hostel (which had great reviews on Guthook).
Sadly because it was Memorial Day Monday, Timbers had closed early.  Irish rode a bike in the dark to a convenience store to get some pizza and drinks.  Tom (retired NYC firefighter and section hiker), Phin, Irish and I stayed up unusually late enjoying each other’s company.

We missed dinner at The Timbers because they closed early for Memorial Day, so we were looking forward to a big breakfast – but it was not open, even though we were there at 7:45 minutes and the sign said:  “Open Everyday – 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.”
So I went back to the Trail and started hiking north.  Almost immediately I came to another state park with picnic areas and swimming, etc.  Then a decent climb up to Quarry Gap shelter, which was among the nicest I’ve seen, included a porch swing.  I took a break and visited with Mojave, a section hiker, and a father and son as they also stopped.  Then for five miles I walked generally on a ridge with no views, thick undergrowth and generally pleasant trails.  I saw a very small Garter snake in the middle of the path.  Then, I stopped at the PATC cabin to get water and filtered with a large high school group from Ohio.
I had another snack 2.5 miles later at the Birch Run shelter and then pressed on for the last six miles.  (I had originally planned to stop at Birch Run, but the terrain had been relatively easy and I would have finished for the day at 2:00 p.m.)  I reached the halfway point, but no signage for 2018.  I also walked through a large reforestation project that involved a controlled burn.
Towards the end of the day, with the trail similar in design/quality (narrow path through young forest with thick undergrowth close to edges of the Trail), I ran into a black snake in the middle of the path.  I chased it away and continued on.  After a fairly steep descent, I reached the shelter area, which, like most shelters in PA was exceptional.
There ended up being 4 thru-hikers (Trudge, Rockett Chip Cookie and and African-American I did not know) and three section hikers (father/pastor & son and a younger woman whose husband hiked out and left here after dinner).  We visited during dinner and then hit the hay at hiker midnight.
And, the Crawfords came by, but hiked on even though it was after 6:00.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594067,"Michael shuttled Sleeves and me from Allenberry to Pine Grove Furnace so we each could cover miles we missed after the half gallon challenge.  The day is best described in two parts.
Part 1 (a.m.) – Sleeves and I hiked together through a young forest with thick underbrush, often very close to the edges of the trail.  The trail was relatively flat.  We shared great conversation, primarily about our faith lives.  We stopped for lunch at the Green Mountain General Store and enjoyed sub sandwiches.
Part 2 (p.m.) – One of Sleeves’ knees was bothering him, so he elected to slow down.  I had a shuttle to meet with a defined pickup time so I moved on.  The afternoon hike included a number of not insignificant climbs.  Moreover, the trail went along, over and through several large rock piles/formations requiring much climbing and scrambling with use of hands.  The day was fairly warm so I sweated a lot during the climbs and had to stop and filter water to be sure I was hydrated.
The trail eventually comes down off the high ridge dropping into Boiling Springs after a mile and a half through (sunny and hot) farmer fields.  The trail concluded for the day at the ATC regional office along side the downtown lake where the water “boils.”

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594070,"After completing an interview with Mighty Blue, Barb (my guest hiker for the day) picked me up and we made our way to the planned, termination point for the day’s hike.  Shuttle driver Michael picked us up there and then dropped us in Boiling Springs (where I hiked into the town yesterday).  Boiling Springs is an attractive village with a small lake in the center of town where the water “boils,” but never gets any warmer than 52 degrees.
Barb and I met on a trip to the Holy Land in September when I was able to tag along with her church group.  She has been one of my biggest supporters and encouragers – and she has been resolute in hoping to hike with me for a day or two.  She drove two hours from Philadelphia to join me this day.
Our 17-mile outing started on an overcast, warm, humid day near the “boiling” spring in town (amidst an early morning crowd beginning to celebrate Foundry Day).  We headed north and quickly entered some woodland.  The day’s hike would take us through forest, many pastures or farmer fields, by barns and silos, down country roads, over Interstate 81, on boardwalk, along side a beautiful creek, and through fields of tall grass.  The terrain was mostly very flat (said to be the lowest and flattest section of any distance on the Trail) although at the end of the day we climbed a couple of pretty good hills.  We interacted with many day hikers, runners, and fellow thru-hikers who filled and tried to share the narrow and often muddy footpath.
Barb packed a huge lunch and extensive snacks for us – courtesy of WAWA.  We snacked on pistachios, grapefruit, watermelon, pepperoni and cheese.  (No, I didn’t eat any watermelon, but it was great to have two huge, juicy grapefruits.)  After ten miles we visited the ATC Scott FarmTrail HQ, which offered a great picnic spot by the Conodoguinet Creek with cold water and a picnic table.
Although warm, the day got progressively clearer and drier.  We had bright sun for the afternoon, which offered some beautiful views of the area farmland in the later afternoon light.  Barb was a strong hiker and great conversationalist.  All in all a great day on the AT.  I’m most appreciative of Barb’s interest in and encouragement concerning my journey.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594071,"Michael’s sister shuttled me back to where Barb and I finished the prior day – PA 850.  I ran into Gypsy just as I started the day.  The weather was cloudy and cool – very nice for hiking.  There was an initial climb to bring us up to the top of the ridge, which we followed for the day before dropping down a steep hill with many makeshift stone staircases.
AWOL warned that most of the hike after the pipeline view was very rocky.  I had prepared for the worst and part of my plan to manage my concern about the rocks of Pennsylvania was to just go slow – the low mileage day (9 miles) was part of that plan.  Surprisingly, but thankfully, the warning about the rocks was exaggerated.  We have maneuvered through many areas that had rocks as difficult or worse than today.  I had a snack near the Cove Mountain shelter and then moved on.  We did have a nice view at Hawk Rock, which marked the beginning of the very steep descent into Duncannon.
I made my way down, into town and stopped at The Doyle for a burger and a beer.  I sat with Tuck and a local couple.  Sleeves came by and we got a ride to the motel.  I rested and watched the Memorial golf tournament and later shared a pizza with Sleeves.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594072,"I got a 7:00 am shuttle back to The Doyle and resumed my hike there.  The AT goes through Duncannon on a residential street parallel to Main Street before crossing over two rivers (one being the Susquehanna) on two noisy (street noise) bridges.
The trail immediately ascends once across the Susquehanna.  The climb is significant but generally on a good trail and a fair grade.  The hiker though is greeted with significant rock scrambling at the ridge top, which continues for some time – maybe ½ mile.  This may have been an intro to the infamous “Rocksylvania.”
The trail was an ever changing mixture of nice, packed earth and brutal irregular rocks, loose rock, or large boulders.  Fortunately,there was only modest climbs and descents.  Unfortunately, there was very little to see except a couple of lookouts.  The day was cool and cloudy, but finished partly sunny.
After 5 hours of hiking I stopped for a lunch break.  Because it looked like I wouldn’t have a water source at camp I cooked a Trailtopia for lunch.  Big Tent and Hooty Hoo joined me.  We got great trail magic (drinks, baked goods, Snickers, water, etc.) from Mike Burton, a gentleman who is a trail volunteer.
The afternoon was much like the morning, but better weather (nice breeze) and no steep climbs.  I selected a campsite after a 16 mile day.  Big Tent and Hooty Hoo later joined me at the site for dinner, but moved on to next campsite.

A boring day with an earthen trail between ferns or similar vegetation interrupted by a few rocky areas (some of which required significant climbing/rock scrambling).  Every time I was about to get frustrated, the rocks seemed to dissipate and I was returned to a fine trail.  Again, there was almost no elevation gain or loss.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594647,"“Dad” shuttled me from the Microtel. Sunny and warm day. 
The climb out of Port
Clinton is steep at first and then gradual up to the top of the Pennsylvania (Kittatinny)
ridge.  Like the top of the climb out of Duncannon, there is some large rock
scramble towards the top of the climb out of Port Clinton.  The ridge “line”
here was certainly more irregular requiring a few more climbs/descents - one of
which was probably as steep as the descent
into Port Clinton, but fairly brief.  Much of trail was quite
smooth. After seven miles of mostly fine trails I reached Pulpit Rock and a couple miles later, The Pinnacle – both are nice lookouts, but there were many rocks between as well as a little north of The Pinnacle.  Then the trail offered a nice, broad smooth path which I took all the way to the shelter.The tenting area was busy.  I met Detail and reconnected with Maverick (and his son, Goober, from the Smokies).  Also there was Double Tap and Seven, two section hikers, and flipfloppers “Sierra” and “22” – and Chili Dog (with whom I had pancakes at Bears Den hostel).

Good views at Dan’s Pulpit.
Looking back, I’d say, “the Pennsylvanian rocks begin at Dans Pulpit.”
Significant rocks between Dans Pulpit and Boulder Rock.  Then the rocks were on and off – both large boulder scrambling and minefields of smaller rocks covering the entire footpath.  This continued for most of the way to Allentown Hiking Club shelter, where I had a quick snack break and saw Double Tap and Seven.
I hiked from the shelter to Route 309 and The Summit with Double Tap and Seven.  The trail after the shelter is an abandoned forest road with little elevation change so we made good time.  Then we enjoyed lunch at The Summit.  I checked into the B&B and had a quiet afternoon of writing.

At mile 3 we encountered the infamous Knife Edge, which required very careful attention to each step.  From there the rock challenges were on and off util we descended from Bake Oven Knob, which was treacherous.
Rob and I enjoyed the hike, scrambling through large boulders and across precarious ledges, coasting along nice pathways with little elevation gain or loss, and good conversation on a beautiful day.  Overall we judged the rock quotient at 1/3 nice path, 1/3 meddlesome small rocks across the trail, and 1/3 serious/difficult/dangerous rock hopping/scrambling, which was easier (and often more fun) than we anticipated.
We arrived at the shelter before 4:00 pm and set up camp on very challenging (sloping) terrain. (We both would slide all night.). Donut arrived from Eckville.  And then Big Tent and Hooty Hoo (and Caroline) showed up.
Rob and I filtered water and cooked Trailtopia (and enjoyed a nice Cab, which Rob carried for us for 13 miles).  Beautiful evening.  Star-filled, cool evening.  I tented without my rain fly.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594755,"Rob and I left the shelter by 6:15.  We filtered water north of the shelter and each carried 3 liters because there was to be no real water source for the entire day.
After a brief hike downhill we were at the Lehigh River, which we crossed on a road bridge.  Then the assault on the famous/infamous Lehigh Gap began – a near vertical climb out of the gap requiring much boulder scrambling for a mile.  The weather was cool and clear – perfect for our climb.  While difficult and even scary in a few places, the climb was mostly fun and not as hard as it had been billed.
Views during the climb were beautiful.  After reaching the top, the trail was easy and smooth for probably two miles – then, rocks.  The rocks about which I feared finally appeared – a nearly continuous minefield of both smallish, angular rocks (golf ball, baseball, and football sized) and medium-sized (football to beach ball sized) rocks filling up most of the trail so that great care (read: very slow going) had to be taken to navigate these obstacles.  For the impatient, a hiker might march through these obstacles but not without boot damaging and foot bruising encounters with the rocks.  The day also involved some large boulder hopping and scrambling.  While at times (particularly when descending) this is challenging, usually it is somewhat fun.
In the middle of the day, the “small rock” minefields continued down a fair decent, followed by an immediate climb through a large boulder scree field, at the top of which we stopped for lunch.
The afternoon was mostly frustrating rocky trail with no views and little reprieve.  Towards Little Gap Road and some of the final three miles into the shelter were reasonable paths but for the most part the day was one of looking down, trying to make forward progress through the rocks while trying to minimize the number of rocks that bruised the toes or the bottom or sides of the feet.  (As Rob referred to it, our own “Bataan Death March.”)
We finally rolled into the shelter area and tented, glad to be done with a tough, 17-mile day.  We had a long hike to find and filter water, but then enjoyed a great dinner of Trailtopia, more good red wine, and chocolate coffee beans.
There was a large number of hikers also tenting at the shelter area, but plenty of good (read: flat) sites.  It did not take much for us to call it a night and fall asleep after this day – kudos to Rob for persevering through a day of multiple challenges.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594757,"Rob and I left the shelter by 7:15 after some oatmeal and coffee.  Rain showers threatened.  Rob had only 4.5 miles to Wind Gap where he would meet a shuttle to return him to his car so he could get back to Richmond.  We encountered plenty of rocks but arrived at Wind Gap right at 10 am.  Rob and I parted.  I’ll always be grateful for his company and encouragement through some tough parts of the Trail.
After a steep climb out of the gap to return to the ridgeline I was greeted by both rain and rocks.  Because Rob and I made Wind Gap much sooner than expected I considered trying to push through all the way to Delaware Water Gap, but I needed to see how fast I could move through what I anticipated would be slow going.  (Scars had said the worst rocks were between Wind Gap and Water Gap.)
I started into the rocks, and now (after the fact), if I had to pick, I’d say the worst rocks in Pennsylvania were after the climb out of Wind Gap until Wolf Rocks (about five miles where there is little reprieve AND the rocks are particularly difficult due to their size, shape and abundance).  With the rain, the severe rocks, no company, and the uninteresting environment I had to set my mind to just getting through this part of the hike.  (In Pennsylvania I have said often the terrain is “uninteresting” or even “boring” (or “monotonous”)).  Earlier today I read a post from a trail friend that suggests a nice contrast between “uninteresting” and a more exciting walk in the natural world:
 And the sights today, oh wow.  I tried to capture what I could in photo/video, but an iPhone could never do it justice.  My day was simply full of natural wonder and beauty.  Today’s breathtaking moments consisted of standing at the top of Bromly Mountain Ski Resort, ridge walking Baker Peak, walking along the edge of Little Rock Pond (above), following the edge of Big Branch River, and even walking through a Rock Cairn Garden …
(Courtesy: Sharkbait)
I did put on some music (and listened to a Freakanomics and an RZIM podcast).  The rocks WERE terrible and I rarely picked my head up.  More than once I would set my foot only to have it involuntarily shoved or slide into a sharp edge of a neighboring rock, bruising some part of the sides or top of my foot (any portion not protected by the sole or toe cap).  It continued to rain so the rocks were wet, which called for even more patience, which somehow I seemed to conjure up.  Although I had had a few moments of anger and frustration over the rocks while hiking with Rob, I did not let myself give in to the frustration.
A couple of younger thru-hikers passed me, but otherwise it was a depressing and solitary afternoon.  I did listen to Mighty Blue’s most recent interview of me and (because I have been trying to manage actively my emotional state) was encouraged by his observation:  “Your personal management of your hike is almost as if you personally intervene in your own psyche, . . . you manage your own psyche on the trail, don’t you?  You know what should be coming, you make those changes to your expectations. . . . For me everything was new.”
After Wolf Rocks I noted that I still had 8 miles to go to get to DWG.  The last shelter was coming up soon, so I had to make a final decision.  At my usual average of 2 to 2.5 miles per hour I could get to DWG, provided the rocks were not too bad.  I decided to go for DWG and get finished with Pennsylvania.  The rest of the Trail was unite a mixed bag of beautiful soft pathway, a number of small but seemingly pointless ups and downs, more troublesome rocks, a long stretch on an old road bed (where I could make good time) and a 2.5 mile steep, difficult descent into DWG.  I did fall coming down a makeshift stone staircase when a flat rock tilted forward making the wet surface slanted. I twisted my right ankle, banged my right elbow and wrenched my right shoulder a bit.  Picking up the pieces, I seemed to be alright – nothing hurt seriously.  Shortly thereafter I got a call from my buddy Sleeves saying he was going home (I had left him in Duncannon) for medical attention.  (The “sore knee” he thought he had from a fall 150 miles earlier was actually a broken tibia.)
With four miles to go I noted that I was fatigued.  I was starting to feel the weight of the pack and my legs were tiring.  I had no choice now but to press on.  The weather moderated and the sun tried hard to appear.  There were a few views down towards the Delaware River and the narrow gap it had dug through the low mountain ridge.  Stacy called ahead and booked me a room so I could roll into something comfortable even if I had to arrive after 8:00 p.m.
I pressed on.  The descent was arduous physically because of its steepness and duration, mentally because of the wetness of the rocks and terrain, especially at a time when I was nearly exhausted.
I forced my way down and was delighted to finish at the Deer Head Inn.  After a quick shower I enjoyed dinner at the Sycamore Grill.  I all but collapsed into bed with a belly full of food after – perhaps – my toughest one day of hiking.  (I even noticed my hands were sore and swollen – I guess from the long day of gripping strongly to help maintain balance through the rocks, to help power up the inclines, and to help ease me down the long, steep descent.)  I’m going to need my zero day, but there is a great deal of satisfaction having completed Pennsylvania – a state (and almost 230 miles) that may have created more stress (and therefore required very focused management of my emotional/mental state) than any task to date.  In reality, the rocks of Pennsylvania were not fun (although some of the very large rock scrambling was fun – and some was harrowing), were extremely difficult and/or frustrating at times, but in the final analysis were not as bad as the hype or as bad as I had anticipated.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595002,"[This section was hiked southbound, but described here as a northbound hike.]
This was one of my favorite hiking days in a long time.  The air was crisp.  The sky clear and blue with fair weather clouds.  I enjoyed a beautiful glacial pond, flowering Mountain Laurel, and views both east and edit from the NJ ridge.  And the terrain and foot tread were very friendly, although some rocks remain.
Leaving Delaware Water Gap requires a mile and a half road walk along/under I-80, but seems even longer.  The Trail then heads up towards the ridge on a path very popular with day hikers, so the trail is wide, generally smooth and nicely graded.  At the end of the easy climb the hiker arrives at Sunfish Pond – a National Natural Landmark and the first glacial pond northbound hikers experience.  And it was beautiful.  The AT actually follows the shore on the pond’s west side.  I enjoyed an early lunch on some rocks along the edge of the pond.
After some additional, modest climbing you reach Kittatinny Mountain and the top of the ridge.  Following the ridge offers pleasant hiking (with some rocks thrown in), a few black snakes, and frequent views, both east and west.  The views back down towards Sunfish Pond are particularly beautiful.
This 13-mile hike ends with a modest descent to a gravel road and a short walk up to the AMC Mohican Center – which offers hostel lodging, meals, and a store for some gear and resupply.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595393,"Beautiful early morning hiking.  I climbed up to the highest point in New Jersey and then descended.  After about three miles I passed County Rt 519 and reputedly the end of the rocks.  From there the hiking was smooth and easy including walking through farmland.  The morning stayed pleasant and I worked my way into Unionville, NY. 
Irish Paul, Luke, Ironman, Next Step, Pulitzer and a couple other hikers were in town.  We hung out for three hours.  I did some resupply.  The day had become hotter.
After our lunch/rest/visit the hiking was unusual in that there was a long road walk followed by a flat, exposed walk around Wallkill Wildlife Refuge.  The trailmagic of a cold drink at the end of this section was quite refreshing.
Tired from the heat, I climbed up Pochuck Mountain to the shelter.  Tented there with Scoot, Irish and Luke.  A bear was wandering just outside the edges of the shelter/tenting area.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596833,"Hard rain overnight but my tent held up fine, but I had wet tent to pack up.  I planned a shorter day (12 miles), which included a plan to hit another hot dog stand AND ice cream shop.  I started later than usual hoping the tent might dry but as it was drying a shower hit ruining that plan.
The weather was cloudy but clearing was forecast.  The early hike was pleasant as we had fairly level and rolling terrain with some modest climbs through rock formations.  As I was approaching Prospect Rock the sky was clearing.  The climb before and up to Prospect Rock was not too difficult, but it was the start of about 4-5 miles of ridge walking along flatish rocks, sometimes angled, sometimes rounded off, sometimes requiring scrambling (use of all four limbs), sometimes requiring short, steep difficult ascents and descents, sometimes requiring rock hopping, sometimes involving tricky footholds, and sometimes offering magnificent views north and east, including many views of Greenwood Lake and the Catskills.  (Shortly after Prospect Rock we formally entered New York, another state “in the books.”)
It was unexpected.  It was very different from New Jersey or Pennsylvania.  Mostly it was fun, but after awhile it wore on me, despite a couple of breaks.  (If I can complete my fundraiser for the ATC, perhaps Suzanne and Laurie can buy some white paint for the trail maintenance club in southern New York.)  Finally we were given a pleasant trail and a descent to NJ Rt 94, where a section hiker was proving trail magic (cokes, fruit, water, Snickers and a pair of Darn Tough socks).  He also watched our packs as Fritz (from Germany) and I walked 300 yards to get hot dogs and ice cream – exceptional.
From the road/trailhead we had two miles to the shelter.  The trail started off perfectly, but the AT threw in almost another mile of climbs/ridge walking/rock scrambling like midday, including Eastern Pinnacles and the particularly difficult (the very short ascents and descents) Cat Rocks that were like a tabletop once you climbed to the top.
Then it was a short final walk to the shelter.  Scoot and I tented.  Fritz hiked on having not realized there was no water source at the shelter.

",Wildcat shelter/Mile 1375.1,"Jun 21, Thu",12.10
RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596835,"No one can say New York is just an extension of New Jersey – it is proving not to be more of the same.  Yesterday was tiring (my mantra: “Everyday is hard.”), but a fun and exciting day.  The weather was perfect, the rocks manageable and mostly fun, if extensive (4 miles or more) and the views exceptional.  Today was a bit of a curveball or a slap to the side of the head – very different from the prior day.  Despite my planning, I did not see the difficulty of this day coming.
Expecting a long day with a 19 mile objective, I headed out at 6:15 am, but before we could leave we had to redirect a 400 pound+ black bear who was coming down the shelter trail just as we were leaving.  Once I said  “Hey, there,” the bear turned away and walked down the hill away from us.  (A big reason for the planned, long day was the very recent reports of a very active bear at the otherwise logical stopping point for the day. We planned to hike 4-5 more miles to get by the “active bear area.”)
The early hiking was relatively easy and included a long descent.  After crossing a local road the day really began.  While there were some easy or modest trail (such as the walk along a large pond and some very pleasant foot tread) even then the moderate trail was often rocky.  Further, although the trail was interesting (as opposed of my disappointment with most of AT throughPennsylvania) the way in moved through and around various large rock formations/outcroppings, the challenge for the day consisted primarily of numerous climbs over, around and through various, vertical rock fields/formations/ridges/ledges – both brief and extensive.  These climbs (and to a lesser extent the inevitable descents) often required holstering my trekking poles and using my hands to find holds to work up through the rocks.  At the same time, these climbs required extensive use of my poles to help lift myself up tough steps, steady my balance, and ease myself done.  (At he end of the day my hands were uncomfortably sore and swollen, I believe from gripping my poles so tight so many times.)  These climbs often called for uncomfortable steps with very bad consequences if I slipped.  I found myself saying (to an extent I do not recall saying previously), “this is dangerous activity.”  Likewise, often I said to myself [as I have said previously at the prior day’s rock/ridge scrambles as well as at Firescald ridge (two days north of Hot Springs, NC), the Sinking Creek Mountain ridge crest (a day south of Dragon’s Tooth outside Roanoke, Virginia), Dragon’s Tooth itself, and in Pennsylvania the ridge top just out of Duncannon as well as Bear Rocks, Bake Oven Knob and the Knife Edge, “I have no idea how I could do this (get through this part of trail) in the rain or in wet conditions.”)
The first of these were up through terrain to Mombasha High Point – tough but modest, and somewhat fun.  The next significant vertical, rock climb was an unnamed “summit,” then Buchanan Mountain (perhaps the most vertical climb we’ve seen on the hike thus far), then Arden Mountain (consisting of three separate climbs to reach the top).  Keep in mind between these major climbs were difficult descents and many intermediate, shorter climbs/descents.  The consolation (or “counter” to my suggestion that these climbs were epic in nature) is that while incredibly steep, the climbs are brief (typically, only 200 to 400 feet of elevation.  As a matter of comparison, I found the (infamous) climb out of Lehigh Gap/Palmerton (known to just about every thru-hiker doing almost any planning) to be materially easier than Buchanan Mountain (a climb I never learned about despite my allegedly excessive preparation).
I had only gone about 9 miles by 12:15 pm.  I rested and took lunch at the top of Arden Mtn.  Next was a descent as steep (perhaps steeper) as anything we’ve encountered since Springer Mountain – again, it was surprising to me I didn’t see this section of trail coming.  (We’ve been warned that the White Mountains in NH would be like this, but even more extensive (longer vertical climbs of hand-over-hand scrambling), thus, we should moderate daily distance expectations/goals.  Hence, I’d like to think I would never have planned a 19 mile day through this section of trail.)
After a good break I started down.  Various times I was uncomfortable with the type of step required to simply descend – these times I would study the trail and seek an alternative to the path the primary trail line.  Sometimes I’d have to toss my poles down and get on my back side or actually turn around and descend like going down a ladder so I had the benefit of hand holds.
As I worked my way down slowly (NY Rt 17 was at the base of this descent) began to think through the rest of the day and the next day.  Rain was 100% expected overnight and the following day.  I could not figure out a strategy to finish the day (I would not be able to complete the 19 miles – although I’m not sure it would have mattered) and be in a position the next day to have a successful (and safe) hike – it seemed inevitable that I would be faced with climbing similar terrain in the rain.
With very mixed emotions (my ego and machismo urged me to “suck it up,” “act like a man,” and keep moving) when I reached the road/trailhead I decided to see if I could get off the trail.  (I was scheduled the next day to be in a motel at the end of the day to wait for Brooke to arrive so she could hike with me again.)  In 20 minutes, after a call to the hotel and a few taps on my Uber app, it was settled – I was going to spend the night off trail.
With both a sense of relief, but some guilt, in another 20 minutes I was riding in my Uber driver’s new RAV4 on my way the the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel.  I knew I made the right decision.  I knew that Cheryl would have urged me to make the same decision, without any guilt or hesitation.  It was (and continues o be) interesting to how certain emotions and expectations play into certain decision making.  Somehow, a little more than 12 hours later, as I record this (after a good night’s rest), I’m still not very proud of my decision to take “the easy way out.”  I’m trying to take solace in this observation:  Washington ran from the field more than once disrupting the British expectations of a “proper” battle. He did this primarily so he could keep his troops together and alive so they could “fight another day.”  (I’d like to think that good decision making, like it did for the Colonial Army, will help me get to Katahdin.  Yet, the length of this post suggests some lingering disappointment in myself - as my friends know I love to say, “doth protest too much.”)

After the interview I crossed into Connecticut.  A little while later I ran into Ladybug again and we hiked together for a few miles.  With her faster pace and the relatively easy trail I was well ahead of schedule.  I stopped for water and lunch and then stopped shortly thereafter at the shelter (which had a little free library) to visit with Stickers & Ladybug and a southbound thru-hiking couple (with both a cat and a dog).
The hike finished in grand style.  After a climb over Ten Mile Hill we descended to Ten Mile River, hiked along this River and then reached its confluence with the much larger Housatonic River.  The trail then followed the Housatonic through mostly broad, well-used pine needle covered trails.
A brief walk off trail took me through the Bulls Bridge covered bridge and then the Bulls Bridge general store.  I had about an hour to rest and enjoy a cold beverage before Uncle Jim (my sister Jennifer’s husband) picked me up and brought me to their home in Monroe, CT.

Everett.The day began immediately with a climb up to Lions Head.  Unfortunately, with the heat the sky was somewhat hazy, the view was not all that it could be.  On a perfect day with the sun coming out of the west, the view here is likely among the best of the trip.Then I had to descend slightly, follow the ridge to the base of and get ready for Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut.  This climb was fairly steep heading up, but severe on the descent, requiring much cautious work through the rocks, ledges and steep grade.Coming down off of Bear Mountain leads hikers to the border between CT and Massachusetts and into Sages Ravine – a lovely mountain  stream cutting a deep ravine and featuring modest falls and deep pools.  The trail follows this stream for some distance making fir a most pleasant walk.  I also resupplied on water here.Next was climb number three for the day – Mt. Race.  This was a longer, but reasonable climb, but the heat of the day was increasing.  The last half mile of this ascent is over and along ledges offering 180 degree views east – quite beautiful.Originally with the heat I planned to camp after Mt. Race and save Mt. Everett for the next day when I’d be fresh – Mt. Everett is known to be a tough, vertical climb and an equally tough descent.  Rain was forecast and I did not want to tackle Mt. Everett in wet conditions - do I pushed myself to complete this fourth climb of the day.  It was a severely vertical climb over and through rocks including many large, smooth rocks where footholds were so hard to find the trail maintainers bolted wooden steps over the rocks in places. Coming down was equally challenging but probably not as severe as the descent from Bear Mountain.I was quite pleased to have gotten all four climbs done the same day, especially considering the heat.  We descended from Everett down to Glacier Pond and were pleasantly surprised to find plenty of jugs of cold water.  I ran into Trey and Ambassador here and then pushed on an easy half mile to the tenting area.  Ambassador, Sunshine, Summer Breeze and their dog were there as well as a large summer camp group of boys out for one night.  Ambassador and I ate dinner together and then headed in for the night.  It was warm, over 70 degrees, and sleeping proved hard. BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597346,"We did not get any rain overnight, but it was expected by 8:00 am so I made sure to get packed up before I had a wet tent.  There was a considerable (3 miles) descent from the shelter site.  After filtering water I got hiking a little after 8:00.The rain showed up around 9:00 and became very hard for an hour.  The descent (from Mt. Bushnell) involved considerable work over and down through a continual series of rock ledges and formations – thus is the type of climbing I find most dangerous.  Everything was drenched and the trail became a stream.  I moved slowly and cautiously for quite some time but got down without incidence.  But for the weather, there appeared to have been some goods views on the climb down – we had nothing but thick clouds.After the descent the trail is relatively flat all the way to U.S. 7.  The trail has diversity in that it takes the hiker through agricultural fields, a swamp, a lengthy evergreen forest (where the mosquitos were the most fierce of the trip) and a bog.  There was one trailhead at Sheffield Egremont Road where a monument to the last battle of Shays Rebellion is right on the AT.Another 2 miles and before I knew it I was at the US 7 trailhead.  Jess picked me up and took me to her home/hostel where I had a resupply waiting for me.The rest of the day was shower, laundry, planning, writing and rest.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597348,"Another great day of hiking.
Jess served us eggs and Shelter Shaker and I were on the trail by 7:30.  Beautiful morning.  Early hike passed farmer fields of young corn and the Housatonic River.  Then a fairly good climb (up East Mountain - where a nice view east was offered), but the grade was nice and the trail excellent.  Shout out to trail maintenance club here for great work on its trails, especially its rock work (such as rock stairs through steep areas).
The hike today offered a diversity of sights and experience, and typically good trail.  Rather than pursue them like a direct, vertical assault (as we did too often in New York), the trail works it’s way more indirectly around or along the rock ledges, outcroppings and other formations like it was taking you on a tour of these geologic attractions.  We walked along part of the beautiful Benedict Pond, an “ice gulch,” a beaver pond, a cobble (the Tyringham Cobble or “Cobble Hill”) and remnant stone wall from old Shaker village.  I got trail magic (baked goods) twice within 30 minutes from local day hikers and from a local couple that completed a thru-hike last year.
It was warm but pleasant.  Mosquitos were tolerable.  It was quiet on the trail.  Few thru-hikers but a dozen day hikers.
A farm stand offered cold drinks and snacks on the honor system right near the end of the 20 mile day.  Too much bear activity required that I skip the Shaker site and stealth camp, which I did with Sunshine and Summer Breeze (and their dog).

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597691,"I was early early because I had an ambitious day planned.  Almost immediately I had the first of the day’s largest climbs of the day – up Baldy Mountain.  Like I have many times before, I said to myself “let’s NOC out this climb.”  [It refers to the slow/steady approach I used to tackle the long, seven mile climb out of the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  It may seem such a simple proposition but until that point (150 miles) I would more often go harder and stop to catch my breathe, then go hard again, etc.  The climb out of the NOC really demonstrated an alternative and I think superior way to overcome tough climbs.]
After he climb we were (again) on a rolling ridge line, which was generally pleasant hiking and which I took all the way to Upper Goose Pond – a beautiful, large pond where the AMC has a cabin and provides bunks and camping.  It seemed far too early to stop, but I had heard much about UGP and was tempted to stay even though it was a half mile off the trail.
As I pondered this decision I came upon a beautiful pine grove next to the pond.  The sun was out, but this grove was shaded.  The pond was quietly lapping on the shore nearby and a wonderful breeze was keeping it cool and bug free.  I decided there wasn’t a much better way to enjoy UGP than right where I was.  I coked a Trailtopia dinner and relaxed over a long midday meal/break.  Another thru-hiker joined me and after a full hour I headed off – all I was leaving behind was a bunk and morning pancakes, not enough to miss the chance to get in some more miles.
October Mountain shelter, my destination now, was still another nine miles.  Like the morning’s start, the afternoon featured the day’s other substantial climb – we had just crossed over the Massachusetts Turnpike and apparently were switching ridges.  The day was hot so before tackling this climb I stopped at a motel next to the trail to have a couple of cold drinks and to pack one out.
Although I decided to also “NOC” out this climb, the trail up Becket Mountain was so well designed that I made it up easier than expected.  I celebrated with a Mug root beer I carried up the climb.  A couple day hiking was very interested in my hike and took my trash (soda can) down the mountain for me. From there I was mostly focused on knocking out the miles and not getting to camp too late.
The afternoon was otherwise uneventful.  The trail took us by Finnerty Pond (somewhat like Upper Goose Pond) as well as a nameless beaver pond.  There were no views from any high points, not even the summit of Becket.  There were a couple of steep, but short climbs on the way.  I got to the shelter area by 6:45. Honey Legs, who had joined me for lunch, a couple from Wytheville, Virginia section hiking, a NOBO German couple and an elderly, deaf hiker shared the area with me for the night.  It was still very warm and the mosquitos were ferocious. I setup my tent and got in quickly (I had cooked my lunch so I could snack in my tent for dinner.)

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597697,"This was not the best day of hiking.
The day began still, humid and warm.  Mosquitos were busy, but not ferocious.  I was eager to hike this section because I had done it in a shakedown hike in the fall of 2016  - or at least I thought I had.  Confusion I experienced yesterday about the trail continued this morning. (I was certain my shakedown trip started at Rt 20, but definitely not by climbing Becket Mountain.)  Likewise, things looked different.  I could only assume that this part of the AT in Massachusetts was partially rerouted in the last two years.
While memories are not always right or precise, the trail was not the smooth earthen footpath I recall, so I wondered why someone substituted a winding, rocky, swampy and hilly path for the perfect one I recalled – so, you can see, the hiking was not the best.  After 6 plus hours I made the near vertical climb over the last “hump” before descending into the town of Dalton where the trail works it’s way right through town.
It was particularly warm/hot now – the sun was bright and I was on exposed roads.  I stopped at a convenience store for some cold drinks and to supplement my lunch.  I took a long break to eat/drink/rest.  The trail out of town was similarly open and hot.  Then there was a long climb back up to the ridgeline.  It was a long tiring afternoon on that ridge and then a descent into another trail town – Cheshire.  I found the church, enjoyed some of their A/C and setup my tent for the night.  BHM

The climb was long but generally steady.  I remembered it from a 2016 shakedown hike.  The trail was quiet.  I saw my second southbound who left from Katahdin.  The only other person I saw on the trail was someone on a connecting trail who was exercising a dog from the local shelter.  As I was in no rush, I spent time with him as well as earlier with the SOBO.
After the climb the trail stays along the ridgeline for a couple of miles and then there is a final, one mile climb to the summit.
I was at the Greylock summit by 1:00.  Had a cold beverage and a hamburger.  Worked on writing and journaling.  I checked into my room at the lodge there.  I enjoyed some live Irish music on the back porch as the sun was setting.
I went out to watch the final sunset.  I ran into Barefoot, Little Blue, Savage & Po.  We sat around the lodge for awhile, then I headed to bed.
In short, refreshing day.  Beautiful weather, even a little chilly at the summit.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598872,"Trail angel Tom agreed to take our packs to Dan’s AT House, so we planned a 22-mile slackpack day.Leaving the Inn the trail headed down and through Gifford Woods State Park.  Savage caught up with me and we hiked together for the next six miles as the rain came down and increased.  We stopped by Thundering Falls but the wet prevented me from taking any photographs.  Then there was a substantial climb up to the top of Quimby Mountain, but no views (the hard rain would have prevent any good views regardless).  Savage pushed on to arrange the next day’s slack.  I stopped at Stony Brook shelter for lunch, where Gizmo, Mrs. T, Bearfoot, Lil Blue, Poe, and Chris (and eventually, Late Start) caught up.I left on my own, knowing my pace was slower.  The rest of the day was rain off and on and a trail with numerous small ups and downs.  Chris came by and then Gizmo.  I hiked with Gizmo the rest of an uneventful day, except we stopped by the “Lookout” cabin, which had some views from its widow’s walk as the clouds had lifted some.  From there it was mostly a long downhill to VT 12 and Dan’s AT House.We ordered pizza and setup in his barn/hostel.BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598873,"I was up early and joined Dan in his home for coffee and a friendly talk about Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.
I headed out around 8:30.  The weather was much improved and after a morning clearing, partly sunny all day.  The hiking was again uneventful as we worked through a series of smaller hills – up and then down and then up.  We had some views of fields and distant mountains and cumulus cloud-filled blue skies.
After lunch a Thistle Hill shelter, I had the afternoon hike by myself as I had delayed at the shelter talking with two SOBO hikers.  (We seem to see at least 5 or 6 southbound thru-hikers everyday now, since entering Vermont.)
I came down into the small village of West Hartford.  After a short town walk I crossed the White River and stopped at Linda/Randy’s place.  The gang was still there.  Although stated they had decided not to carry on after retrieving our packs at Linda/Randy’s.  The group went swimming (and a few dove off the bridge) in the White River and ordered Chinese food, and enjoyed a couple of late night beverages.
It was very busy that night with our 7 in the barn/garage hostel and five others and me tenting.

8/2 was highlighted by a climb up to some of the “Presidentials” – a number of high peaks in the White Mountains named after U.S. Presidents (and, apparently, other famous Americans like Daniel Webster and Benjamin Franklin).  It started as a warm, humid, cloudy day with no views from Webster, Jackson, or Mitzpah hut, but shortly after the hut the sun burned away the clouds and it was a beautiful sunny day with big cumulus clouds (and some partly cloudy skies), including a long walk above tree line, a glimpse from time to time of the summit of Mt. Washington as it went in and out of clouds at the summit, and views from Mt. Eisenhower, Mt. Franklin, and Mt. Monroe – concluding at the Lake of the Clouds hut a mile below the summit of Mt. Washington.

8/3 was highlighted by a climb up to Mt.

Clay, Mt. Jefferson, and Mt. Madison, which was generally (for the Whites) reasonably moderate hiking, except the descent from Madison was brutal (and long) – and light rain started falling.  Rain picked up.  I finally tented as the rain intensified.  The rain continued and was very strong all night.

On 8/7 I hiked out with Recon and Gbolt.  It was partly sunny and overcast – warm and humid.  New England was still unseasonably warm.  The hiking was strenuous at times (tough climb up Mt. Hayes) but nothing crazy.  We stopped after 12 miles.  Setup camp.  Filtered water and bathed in the pond.  Cooked early dinner and before we could finish had thunderstorm.  (Sputnik, CBisquit, Rambler, some section hikers and some SOBOs also at shelter area.)

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601334,"Some rain overnight so I had to pack up a wet tent.  Gbolt and I got started before 7:00.  The sky was clearing and it looked to be a good day.  We had a 3-mile descent to a stream and after filtering some water we ran into Geo and Summit at the waterfalls.  Then we hiked Lone Mountain.  A good climb but the trail was easier – fewer rocks and roots.  Wooded summit, so no views.We then had a modest descent and an easy two miles to the Spaulding Mountain lean-to for lunch.  After a few minutes, Sailor & Snowshoe joined us.  We then had a climb over Spaulding Mountain – interrupted by a thunderstorm.  Again, no views.  Shortly thereafter we reached a bronze plaque commemorating the completion of the Appalachian Trail with the completion of that section of the trail in Maine.  Coincidentally, this year, that spot also marks where northbound thru-hikers like me have 200 miles left to hike to reach the summit of Katahdin and the end of the AT.  The trail continued with no additional climbing to the shoulder of Sugarloaf Mountain (a ski resort mountain).The day ended with a two-mile descent from Sugarloaf to the S. Carrabassett River.  What we did not expect was the severe, difficult, rocky nature of the climb down.  It was so precarious at times that working out a path down and slowly executing it to avoid dangerous falls was much like the work required at Mahoosuc Notch.  Finally, Gbolt and I navigated the descent without incident – thankfully.We were tired, but in reaching the river we had also reached the camping area for the night.  We ran into and tented and enjoyed dinner with Bearfoot and Lil Blue (and two southbounders).  Tired, I crawled into my tent a little after 8:00 pm.  We had severe thunderstorms that evening from 10:30 to midnight. BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601335,"The prior night involved a significant thunderstorm and hard rain.After breaking camp we had two easy miles then a significant climb up to North & South Crocker Mountains.  Tough ascent but good trail (not many crazy rock climbs and a better graded trail).  Down and then back up to North Crocker.  Few views but the weather was clearing and the sun was coming out.Then we had a long, gradual downhill all the way to the road where we would go into Stratton for resupply.  Expecting a nice trail I became very frustrated by the rocks, roots, water and mud that coveted 2 or 3 miles of the trail.  There was little ascent/descent but the constant lifting and maneuvering of each step without making much progress became tedious.  I fell a few times with the wet conditions, but nothing significant.  My patience ran thin and I was eager to be done.  Towards the end we did get some relief with a decent trail.Stratton Motel (Trout) picked us up around 2:00 and brought us to town (5 miles).  Gbolt and I spent the afternoon doing resupply, laundry, drying our equipment, pack organization as well as enjoying some town food – deli sandwiches for lunch and burgers for dinner.  We visited with a Maine section hiker and Dreamcatcher.  Chairman (from Zealand Hut) was there as well as some thru and some section hikers.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601337,"Trout dropped Gbolt and me at the trailhead around 7:30 am.  After a very pleasant 2-mile hike on a beautiful morning we started the climb up to the Bigelow Range.  We were told these peaks were the last difficult climbs in Maine – and therefore on the rest of our journey.  The trail was not overly rocky/rooty and the grade was reasonable for the amount of elevation gain.We reached the South Horn by 9 am and then moved on to the West Peak of Bigelow Mountain, which again was tough but the trail was easier than many we’ve encountered.  We had an early lunch and did a Mighty Blue interview at the West Peak.  The day was sunny, blue skies and slightly overcast -the views were excellent.  Then onto Avery Peak, which involved a tougher ascent (larger boulders) but only .5.  We visited with some section hikers at the peak and then headed down.The descent from Avery Peak was long (over 2 miles) and difficult.  Rain seemed to be coming, so we called it a day at 4:30 at the Safford Notch campsite.  We got things setup, water filtered and dinner cooked before the rain ( very hard) hit.Overall this was a great day of hiking.  I had been down emotionally in Stratton thinking about another tough climb, especially when thunderstorms were predicted.  As it turned out we had wonderful weather both for hiking and views.  The trails were forgiving so the hiking itself was fun.  With wonderful views and cooler hiking weather, it was among my favorite days on the trail. BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601339,"This may have been the easiest (non-nero) day on the trail.  We left West Carry Pond a little after 7:00 on a beautiful morning.  We walked along the pond and then headed into an evergreen first.  The first mile ad a half was rocks, roots and mud but no climbs.  The path through the forest for another two an a half miles was reasonably easy but had its share of rocks, roots and mud.  We reached East Carry Pond and walked along its west shore – which was an awkward, rocky trail.  We took a morning break overlooking the pond – it was remarkably peaceful and quiet.  There was no wind, no waves lapping the shore, and little sound from any animals.The rest of the trip to Pierce Pond was uneventful.  The trail had a couple of very modest climbs, but for the most part it was flat or slightly downhill all day.  We continued to be challenged by water and mud as well as rocks and roots from time to time, but not as severe as the previous day.We took a lunch break around noon and then finished off the day on fairly nice trail.  We finished by2:00 p.m.  The day continued to be magnificent.  Pierce Pond and the shelter area were beautiful.  Gbolt and I found tenting/hammocking spots on the lakeshore in a pine needle floored grove of evergreens.We setup, filtered water, and walked over to Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camps.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601340,"This was a most pleasant morning and hike, just four miles from the pond to the Kennebec River.  I enjoyed some coffee and breakfast pond side while the sun rose.  Gbolt and I packed and departed by 7:00 am.  The hike was relatively easy, mostly downhill to the river.  We followed the Pierce Pond stream most of the way through pine forest and pine needle path enjoying the vigorous mountain stream punctuated by some cascades and falls.
We arrived at the river a little before 9:00 am.  To cross the Kennebec hikers must take canoe ferry (ferryman provided by the AT).  We quickly crossed and walked into the village of Caratunk.  Our rooms were ready at the Caratunk House.  We showered, did laundry, worked on resupply and enjoyed the best BBQ sandwiches and milkshakes.  The rest of the day was rest and planning for the finish to this hike.  For the first time I was willing to walk through the remaining 150 miles and plan out a schedule to reach Katahdin.  I texted with Cheryl to hopefully plan her visit to hike Katahdin with us.

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602633,"Gbolt and I were up, packed and hiking by 6:30.  Immediately we had a steep, rocky climb up Barren Ledges.  Then we had a relatively hike for an hour until we had to climb up to Barren Mountain.  That was average in difficulty but the descent was steep, rocky and required very slow, cautious going.  Then it was right up 4th Mountain and Third Mountain – each time having to descend some and then climb back up.  These are part of the “Chairback” Mountains and were relatively easy despite the constant roller coaster.  Before Third Mountain was a climb up The Ledges.  This started turning the day more difficult and unpleasant and stressful.  The climb appeared to be a simple .5 but the terrain required climbing over rocks and ledges and each time we gained elevation the next section would give it all back while it called for some tough hiking/climbing/descending.The descent from Third was steep, rocky and time consuming.  Then it was right up Columbus Mountain, which had a perfected graded and relatively easy trail to the summit as well as down – a pleasant surprise.  Then we had to climb Chairback Mountain.  The climb was reasonable, except it had numerous mini climbs followed by mini descents that wore us out as we would work to gain elevation and then be forced to give it back.  The views at top of Third were spectacular (as they were at Third), but the descent was horrendous – among the most difficult, most dangerous, most ridiculous requirements of the entire trail.Once we had dealt with the descent from Chairback Mountain, we thought most of the hard work for the day was done, but we still had four miles, which proved to throw numerous mini climbs and pointless descents at us, and then a long, steep descent (although that trail was pine needles and roots rather than rocks and roots.  (The mud throughout the trail was minimal because three or four sunny days had dried most of it.)We finally descended most of the way to the West Branch of Pleasant River and found a stealth site.  We were both very tired from an unusually difficult 15-mile day.  Mostly we were thankful we had put a major obstacle (the “Chairbacks”) behind us.  We passed by the 2,100 mile marker in the afternoon.  We are both tired and ready to finish.  Sometimes in the day are spirits are high and sometimes we’re frustrated, tired and mostly thinking about being done.  I was in great spirits in the morning but the descents and terrain (and trail routing) got the best of me after lunch.  I’ve always said, we had three business days (the first three) in the 100 mile wilderness when we had the difficult hiking to get through and then we had three pleasure or vacation days.  If nothing else, the weather has been good and we’re on schedule to have our “vacation” days – just need to get over the last (Whitecap) mountain – tomorrow!BHM

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602634,"Again, Gbolt and I were up, packed and hiking by 6:30.  This was a big day – if all went as planned we would summit four peaks, including Whitecap (the last mountain before Katahdin).  We had planned the day in three stages of approximately 6 miles each – 6 miles to a lean-to at the base of first climb, 6 miles of climbing/descending/climbing the four peaks, and 6 mile descent from Whitecap to campsite.We completed the first stage without incident.  It included a ford of a stream and the trail for almost two miles was remarkably flat, smooth, wide and gently graded.  Some of the rest of the first stage was tough due to the trail, not the elevation climb.  I was a bit fatigued and worried how the day was going to go.  We reached the lean-to and rested.  Then we were off to climb the first peak – Gulf Hagas mountain (named after the World Heritage site just off the AT, featuring Maine’s “Grand Canyon”).The climb up Gulf Hagas was short, but very steep, aided by many staircases.  Wooded summit so we headed straight down to resupply our water.  Then we climbed West Peak, which consisted of three sections – a long, smooth gradual climb, then a severe vertical climb (aided again with extensive staircases), and then switchbacks and well-graded trail to the summit.  We headed down and had lunch in the saddle between West Peak and Hay Mountain.  We saw the guy trying to break the AT supported recited as we lunched.  We ran into and visited with Gregory and Firefly.  Hay was a remarkably easy climb, as was its descent.  That left Whitecap.The climb up Whitecap was 1.2 miles.  I was feeling better than the morning and was motivated if not excited to knock off this last mountain.  The day had been clearing all day and now we had a beautiful sky, which we enjoyed as we finally made the summit.  Thus was a huge milestone for Gbolt and me.  It was hard to believe that we had gotten here.  We took time at the summit – photos, a short walk to a view of Katahdin, and we saw Gregory and Firefly again.Then the day got tough.  Actually the whole day was tough, but the long descent came at a time Gbolt and I were tired.  The hike down was very rocky above tree line and the descended for a long time.  The trail was reasonable.  It was just a long way down.  The trail got tougher with rocks and roots.  We walked through a “wasteland” of downed trees, requiring much ducking and climbing tree trunks.  It felt like the descent would never end but eventually we ended up at the lean-to.  One SOBO, two FLFPs, a section hiker, Gregory & Firefly, and Gbolt and me. BHM

My pack was so comfortable I barely noticed the weight.  Gbolt and I were clearly excited, but also grateful for both the weather and the blessings required to get us here safely.  With great, easily graded trail, wonderful sights, perfect weather, and the anticipation of Katahdin and completion of the hike, there was clearly unusual energy in our step.
Before we arrived at Katahdin Stream Campground (and the Birches campsite) to register we had lunch sitting on boulders overlooking Dacey Pond.
We registered, filtered water, and setup at The Birches.  We had dinner with Lotus and Ibex and got ready for bed and our next day – meet Cheryl and climb Mt. Katahdin.  Thankfully, the forecast is for “mostly sunny.”

RTK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602659,"It was very odd – as I packed up my tent after a restless night (caused by the emotions concerning this day’s hike), one of my primary thoughts was “I’m not going to be doing this (sleeping in my tent, packing up each morning, having a peanut butter tortilla for lunch, etc.) tomorrow or the next day, or the next day” – after having done so for the last six months.Gbolt and I walked the quarter mile to the Katahdin Stream Campground to meet Cheryl.  After some anxiety as to whether she had made it or not, Cheryl drive in around 6:55 am.  The parking lot was very busy as many prepared for a day hike up Katahdin on a beautiful Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  We were hiking by around 7:30.The hike started on smooth trail with modest incline for a little over a mile until we reached Katahdin Falls (beautiful).  The severity of the climb and the rocks increased as we hiked, but we were excited and the climb did not seem too difficult.  After about three miles the trail breaks out of the tree line just as the severity of the climb becomes intense.For almost a mile exactly we had little other than climbing up, over, around and through rocks, boulders, ledges and every formation or type of rock – mostly granite.  The climb was not technical, but vertical and difficult with some scary maneuvers.  We often had to help one another.In the middle of the difficult climbing we ran into Lotus & Ibex and then Savage & Po, who each passed us coming down, having completed their trip to the summit and their thru-hikes.Around noon we reached the “Gateway,” – the start of the (relatively flat) tableland.  We could see a congregation of stick figures a mile away at the Katahdin sign.  After a half mile we stopped for lunch on some rocks.  Then we climb the remaining hill to the summit.  For me, it was mostly hard to believe I had reached this moment.  I was glad Cheryl was there and grateful that Gbolt helped me through Maine.  We took some photos and then started to head back down.  (I absentmindedly left my cap at the foot of the Katahdin sign.)  No one said anything but I think we all knew we were already chasing darkness.  It was 2:00 p.m. and we had to get back down the mountain.  We knew that the descent would be more difficult – and therefore would take longer.  I knew Cheryl had been very brave trying to ignore or overcome her fear of heights, but I knew we would have to ease our way down the steep areas of the mountain below the Tableland.The number of difficult and differing tasks required to descend were almost innumerable – and difficult.  We all worked together to find the best route and help each other down.  It was not easy.  There were tasks that seemed too difficult, too dangerous, too reasonable.  Eventually, finally, after spending a lot of time on our backsides working down rock slabs we got below tree line.  From there it was steep and Ricky, but not the intensity of the rocks above the tree line.With less than a mile to go we lost most light and had to use headlamps and flashlights for the last 20 minutes.  We were all thankful and elevated to return safely to the parking lot – having finished the toughest day, yet final day, on the trail.  We gathered and gave thanks – and then Cheryl drove us to Millanocket.  We dropped Gbolt at the AT Lodge and headed to our motel.The journey was over. BHM
