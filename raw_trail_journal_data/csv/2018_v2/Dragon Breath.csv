Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586133,"I've been wanting to hike the Appalachian trail for 15 years. After I met my girlfriend, Allegra (or ""Legs"" as she's known on the AT--class of 2016), I was inspired to finally set a date for my hike. Originally I chose March of 2018, but it didn't look like it would work financially, so I chose March of 2019 instead. As March of this year rolled around, I felt stuck at my job. I felt like I wanted to bash my face into the computer screen. ""Just do it now!"" my friends and family encouraged. So, the next opportunity I had, I put in my two weeks. Two weeks was all I had to get my shit together. Now, here I am with only four days until I fly down to Georgia from Massachusetts and start my journey. Am I really doing this?!",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586134,"So, I’m sitting on the train to North Springs, GA, and I’m still, for the most part, a bundle of nerves. It’s hard for me to write this out, hard for me to focus on anything really. I’ve always had a problem with anxiety, I’ve never really embraced adventures at their beginning. The fun I’ll have, the experiences I’ll have...they’re all theoretical at this point. What’s difficult is that my fears are theoretical as well, and yet they are what most often find purchase in my mind. This probably isn’t the reaction many of the people rooting for me were hoping for, but I know for a fact that it’s the reaction that those who know me knew I would be having. However, things are not hopeless, and I am not discouraged. What makes me who I am is not embracing the unknown with excitement. I’ve probably never done that. What does make me who I am is not backing down. I want to do this, I want to hike the trail, and I want to finish it. Why? Because nervous, anxious, slow-to-trust introverts like me need, NEED to hurl ourselves into the unknown sometimes. It’s healthy, it’s inspiring and above all...it’s fucking brave. To me, courage and bravery are all about fear and anxiety. You need the fear first, only then can one be brave. So today, this first post of mine, is about me being honest with myself and everyone else. I’m excited, but I’m also terrified. A bone deep fear that only people like me will get, and adventure junkies will laugh off as just silliness. ""Embrace it!"" they cry, ""It’ll be awesome!""  And you know what, it will be, but for people like me, that isn’t enough, not in the beginning. So let me just say, for the people that are also like me, if you find something that you really know you want to do, fucking throw yourself at it. Don’t feel like you need to live up to any sort of emotional standard. Be afraid, it’s okay, just keep putting one foot in front of the other. I’m sure I’ll embrace all of this, in time, but right now I’m terrified, and it’s only the determination to do what I know I want to do that’s keeping me going, and I’m just trying to be okay with that.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Fri",0
Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586148,"My stomach was in knots getting shuttled up to the top of Springer Mountain on a cold, 50 degree, misty morning. Hiking backwards the 0.1 miles on the trail to get to the trail head was a little disheartening because it definitely felt like longer than a tenth of a mile, but once I was finally headed in the right direction, I was on my way. I quickly ran into trail magic with warm soup and a cold refreshing coke. I hiked the 8 miles to Hawk Mountain shelter where there were many others, and I got my trail name! The other hikers were trying to light a fire and failing, so I took over and started doing my normal ""sticking my face like right in the fire blowing these huge flames,"" so they called me ""Dragon Breath,"" and said I didn’t earn the name unless I got the fire going, which I did! I then set my tent up, but I ended up sleeping in the shelter because of the rain and the cold. It was so cold that I barely slept at all. My body is more accustomed to a room heated by a toasty wood stove than outside in 30 degrees. There was a point in the night where I had to pee so badly, but it was so cold that I didn't want to leave my sleeping bag. Four hours later, I finally got up the courage to get up to go. It was pretty miserable.","Springer Mountain

Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586151,"I woke up this morning very cold. My gloves really came in handy when taking down my tent, which was a little damp as well from the rain. I hiked down Hawk Mountain and got to a gap where I was able to call my girlfriend. I know it's cheesy, but I miss her more than anything. So far, that has been one of the hardest things. Today, as I hiked on, I met more people and told them about myself. I started being honest about the fact that I've been fighting through tears a lot of the time on my journey so far. After opening up and letting it out, I really started to feel so much better. I got to Gooch Shelter and set up my things, but it was barely 1:30pm and the sun came out. George, Player One, Papi, Pal, and I all decided to hike on to Woody gap where there were rumors of pizza! Pushing up Ramrock mountain, some people were calling this guy Kaden and me ""Roadrunners."" Though it's tempting to switch trail names, I still really like Dragon Breath. It reminds me of one of my favorite shows, ""Avatar: the last airbender."" It makes me think of firebenders and how they're passionate and emotional (but also of earthbenders who are enduring and patient). After we arrived at Woody Gap, a man offered us a ride to a nearby hostel! Player One double-checked about the pizza, and we were sold. The two of us got a ride to the hostel where I got a nice warm shower and a pack shakedown. Off to Neels Gap tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587272,"So, it’s been a while since I’ve blogged, and I suppose that that’s how it’s going to be for me for the duration of the trip. The trail so far has been an intense experience, one that had begun to shape me in ways I both did and did not expect. First, my legs. Every day they get stronger. However, it’s been more than just strength or endurance. Every day my legs grow hungrier. I began with 8 and 10 mile days, but now I find that those days are, at least mentally, not enough. I’m holding myself back solely to respect my joints and give them time to grow. I am pretty slow, but steady on the uphills. The ascent out of Bly Gap in the pouring rain was a mental gut check. It was cold and pouring rain, and as the night wore on, it got incredibly cold. This brings me to my next major point of self affirmation. The day before I hiked to muskrat shelter, I decided to buy an emergency bivy sack. At first I thought this would be extra, unneeded weight, but I am a cautious man, and I think sometimes people can forget that things can go from fun to life and death very quickly. The following night proved this to be true. We had a member of our trail family, Player One, decide to hike beyond the shelter he initially told us he was going to stay at. A mere 90 minutes from sunset, he rolls into the shelter unexpectedly, sopping wet, shivering, with a soaking wet sleeping bag. While most of us were laughing in amazement and joy to see him, I saw the life threatening situation for what it was. Here was someone who was soaking wet, staring down a below freezing night with nothing but a single set of dry clothes. I sprung into action, and began directing him to get out his tent so I could help him set it up. He could barely prop his tent his hands were shaking so bad, so I got it up for him. I told him to get into his tent immediately and get those dry clothes on, and told Bird to bring heating water for a packet of hot cider. Once in his tent, I took out his emergency blanket and helped him wrap himself up in it. We then gave him the hot cider, and he began to come around. We attempted to dry the sleeping bag, but there was no way. This thing was dripping wet. It was at this point I took out my waste of weight emergency bivy and told him to get inside when he went to sleep. Sleep never really came to Player One that night, he was up all night shivering. If not for that emergency bivy, he may not have made it. I’ve been told time and time again that “emergency gear” is a waste of weight, but at this point, carrying it has already saved one life. Some might consider this an overreaction, but many people don’t know what hypothermia looks like, or how quickly it can cause a person to become unable to help themselves. This experience was intense. A close call. And one that should serve as a lesson to those looking to save weight. I did everything right that day, and no one says I need to act as my brother’s keeper. But you know what? Fuck that. Sometimes it’s someone else who makes a bad call. You could do everything right, and still find yourself with a fellow hiker who really needs your help, and the situation could be one of life and death. I’m not saying we should all carry 20 pound emergency packs, but we should be looking at the high risk situations that definitely could happen, and prepare for them. Maybe it’s a little more medical gear, maybe it’s an emergency bivy, maybe it’s a little extra food, a backup water purification method, or whatever. The point is, if everyone packed their bags with total disregard for every single “what if” situation, we would have some dead hikers. “What if” situations do happen. The odds are small, but they still happen, and they could happen to every one of us. My bivy stays with me now, and anyone who says it’s a waste of weight is going to need to contend with the fact that I’ve already saved a life with it. Very likely it’ll never happen again, and I pray it doesn’t. But in this case, it did, and I’m glad I could use my own training and preparedness to get someone out of a bad situation. Beyond that, things are good. I’ll be making the 16 mile trek into the NOC tomorrow.","?

Dragon Breath,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587839,"Morning 16, Cable Gap Shelter, mile 158.8.  This morning marks my first morning in a steady rain.  It rained all night, and due to how small the shelter is, I spent the night in my tent.  I had some concerns that my little one man tent was little too small, but the presence of rain has made me grateful of the little shelter it provides.  This little tent, the Mountain Hardware Ghost UL1 stood up quite well against the rain.  I had to wrap the bottom of my sleeping bag in my rain coat to provide my toe box with some more wetness protection, and it seemed to do the job.  Despite only having enough room to sit cross legged in the front of the tent, I seemed to do just fine packing everything that needs to go inside my bag without much issue.  Sure, it’s cramped, but it’s better than packing up in the rain.  I began packing my things before sunrise, made the walk to my food bag in the rainy darkness, had a cold breakfast, and drank as much water as I could get down.  I’m thankful that I’m the kind of person that prepares the night before, so I had already filtered 3 liters of water before bed.  The rain can be demoralizing, but at the same time, it brings out my inner cadet.  As difficult as it may sound, I’ve done this before.  Both on training exercises at school as a cadet, and with one of my best friends, Kris, during our backpacking adventures in the White Mountains.  As my dad likes to say, “what’s so bad about the rain? It’s not like there’s any soap in it!”  The wild, indomitable positivity of my wonderful girlfriend Allegra also seems to radiate through me right now.  It’s all about mindset.  Sure, it’s wet and cold and miserable, but it’s also another day that I’m alive and on the trail.  The forest isn’t my house, it’s not my decision as to whether it rains, all I can do is push on.  It’s like my friend Kris always tells me, “Problems without solutions are call truths.”  All in all, with the combination of the wise words and attitudes of my friends and family, and my own resolve, I make for Fontana Dam.","Cable Gap Shelter
