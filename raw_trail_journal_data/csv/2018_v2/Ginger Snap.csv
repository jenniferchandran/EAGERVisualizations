Ginger Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519326,"Well I guess this is it. I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail! I have written and deleted this journal entry too many times to count....if I post it, it makes it ""Official"". However, if I don't become ""Official"" now, I may never have the courage to do so. Hiking this trail has been a dream of mine for YEARS, but I have always told myself, ""You can't do that! That is for special elite people."" Somewhere in the back of my mind I had myself convinced that I was weak, incapable, and unworthy to attempt such a journey.However, after reading some inspiring journals of this past season, I realized that I was cheating myself. Why NOT me?For months I have wrestled with my mind, my reality, and with God. I gave my list of reasons and excuses why this was a bad idea:I can't afford to quit my job.I can't afford it period.It is irresponsible of me.What if am the annoying hiker someone writes about in their journal?WHAT IF I FAIL?????Here is a piece of advice if you don't already know it: Don't argue with God. You can't win. He had an answer for each and every excuse I threw out there. The biggest lesson being.....The ONLY way I could fail, is if I don't TRY.I am almost 41, single, and have zero major responsibilities. I work, come home and hop on the couch to read or watch my Beverly Hills 90210 dvd's. (Don't judge me) I am very much at a point where I CAN do this.Family and friends have been supportive, but I don't think they are at the point where they realize I am dead set, this IS happening. If I don't do this now, I may never have the courage. I want to LIVE life to the fullest. I want to accomplish something that myself and others say I can't. I want to be out in the world that my faithful God made, and feel small and insignificant as I stand and look at it's powerful and majestic scenery. I have a happy ordinary life, but I am unsatisfied. I believe God doesn't want me to just live out the ordinary, but experience the extraordinary. Somewhere out there I hope I can find out more about myself, and fall even more in love with the One who made me.Buckle up...... This should be a fun ride!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Ginger Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519379,"While I am not planning on setting out until March 2018 I know that it will be here before I know it. It is two years away and already I am in panic mode, thinking of all the things I need to get done. Buy gearRaise fundsGet some overnight trips under my belt.Raise fundsMake plans with my job, home, car, etc...Raise fundsDehydrate food, work on mail drops......Did I mention RAISE FUNDS.... yeah that is a big one. I am an avid day hiker, but as of now, I don't have any overnights or extended trips under my belt. That is going to change this Spring/Summer. Luckily I live in the foothills of the Smokies, so I don't have to go far to achieve that. Sometimes I get the feeling that family and friends think I am bluffing about doing this trail. I am not a great achiever. My greatest accomplishment in the past couple of years has been becoming an Online Rocky Trivia Champion. (yes, that is a real thing) However, I don't want to do this for anyone else but me. I NEED to make me proud of me. I want to look back like Grandma Gatewood at the end and say, ""I said I'd do it, and I done it."" Right now I am so overwhelmed with the decision to do this, that I am not even quiet sure where to start. I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, and encouragement. This journey is going to be hard, and I am not looking at it through rose colored glasses. There are going to probably be more difficult days then easy. I am going to cry, scream, throw tantrums, and probably yell for my mommy on more then one occasion. Sounds like a GREAT time to me!","

Ginger Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519380,"I absolutely love being in the mountains. There is just something about being out in their vastness that makes me feel so alive. While I have always enjoyed hiking, it has only became my obsession in the past year. I would go all the time if I could, but sadly, real life keeps me grounded here at home. Every time I go, I relish in the adventure. For 15 years I taught Pre-K. I loved my job. To this day I am more comfortable in a room full of 5 year olds then I am adults. In 2011 I became the Director of the School I taught in. Not a wise choice. I hated it. I sucked at it. I failed. On a hot June day in 2013 I walked out. Not my finest hour. For the past couple years I have roamed trying to find my place. Today, I am happy working my small Accounts Payable clerk job in a Plastics Plant. I make less money, but I love my co-workers, and have ZERO stress. However, somewhere along the way, I have lost who I am. There are days I look in the mirror and I don't recognize the person looking back. I don't live up to the idea of what I thought my life would be. For a long time that was a real issue. I had so many plans, and so much potential. I almost let life defeat me. God has shown me that it is not about living up to what others think of me, but finding my worth and place in Him. Not my job. Not my social status. Not my relationship status. How freeing that is!I am not going on this journey to get a pat on the back when I am done. I am not going to get noticed, or to run away from something. My soul is yearning to go and explore, to throw out all the self hate, self doubt, and disappointment and learn who this gal is once again. Even if I fail, I won't be sad. Well, maybe a little sad, but the real payoff is knowing that I went after it. Maybe climbing these physical mountains, will help me finally climb over my mental ones.","

Ginger Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519385,"So while I like to hike, that is about the ONLY physical activity I like. I grew up watching 90210 and have made it my goal to obtain and watch all 10 seasons of it on dvd so that I can reminisce and relish in what was the 1990's. I am currently on Season 4. Sadly Brandon, Brenda, Kelly, and Dylan are NOT going to hike the 2000+ miles for me. I am in desperate need to keep myself busy for when I am not on the trail, and also to help me loosen up some of these old lady muscles I have suddenly developed. My friend, and occasional hiking buddy, Tammy invited me to a Kickboxing class this week and I jumped at the chance. I looked cute in my little headband, and leggings. I totally looked like I was going to an audition for a really cheap 80's aerobics video. Once I saw the ladies in their cool workout clothes and kickboxing gloves, I knew I was in for a painful night. Tammy and I made it through I am glad to say. However, if the peppy counter girl told me one more time how AWESOME I was I would have punched her with my glove. I really did enjoy this and am thinking of making this a regular activity. What are some other activities that would be good for limbering me up? I hate how stiff I am. I am on a budget and looking for some cheap ideas. Also, I recently did about a 10 mile hike, and I could hardly walk the next day. My shoes where old and had several miles on them. I got some new ones the next day and hope that helps but I am curious about inserts. I have never used them. What are your thoughts and opinions? I am going out again here in a couple weeks and I don't want to be crippled again when I get off trail.","

Ginger Snap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519487,"While I am extremely excited that I have made this decision, I am equally nervous. While a pretty experienced day hiker, I am new to the whole backpacking world. I walked into REI this past weekend and became increasingly overwhelmed with all the choices and selections set out before me. The first three things I know I need to obtain are my pack, sleeping bag/pad and tent. I believe the bag and the tent will be easy decisions for me. I pretty much know what I want there. It is the pack that makes me nervous and anxious. There seem to be so many choices and so many features. This will be carrying all my worldly possessions for 5-6 months, so I don't want to purchase something I am later going to regret and HATE. What should I be looking for in a pack? I am new and green and don't have a lot of resources or people readily available to help me out, so I am reaching out to those of you who have been through this.I tend to freak salesmen out with all my questions, so I thought if I got a few kinks out here, that might help me out when I went.ANY suggestions will be helpful and beneficial to me! Thank you so much!!","
