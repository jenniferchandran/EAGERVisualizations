By the time they got to Damascus they separated. She got off the trail but Frank and Lucy (his pooch )kept on hiking. I was able to get time off work and meet up with him in July. We hiked for a week from Port Clinton to Branchville New Jersey. Even though that was one of the Rockies trails I have hiked on and I was so hot ,I absolutely loved it!

I thought I might stop at muskrat Creek shelter but it was too early at 3:30 in the afternoon.

Today I hiked 13 miles just before Albert mountain which I understand is a serious climb. So far the hiking in North Carolina has been great. The climbs are much easier with many switch backs. The one thing I don't like about North Carolina is there doesn't seem to be a lot of camping spots available for the thru hikers .Everywhere you think is going to be a place to camp they have signs up ,no camping or restoration work in progress.

I caught the shuttle back to the trail and was hiking by 9:30 AM. Seven hours later and 14.6 miles I decided to set up in a nice area next to a stream.

I also wore my iPod for motivation. The 4 1/2 mile descent to NOC seemed to never end. Arriving at 1:30 I grabbed my mail drop and had lunch. A burger and IPA. I decided to bang out a few more miles and found a nice camp site next to a very cool rock formation. The climb out of NOC is strenuous. I am glad I broke it into two days.,"Burnington gap

I thought the rest of the day would be pretty easy but just like so many mountains I have climbed I kept hitting false peaks. I finally descended to Stecoah gap and was rewarded with trail magic!

This is a milestone and the beginning of the Smokies national park. I called for a shuttle and made it to the resort by 11:00. This is a nice place and I think they cater mostly to weekend getaways, all though there are a lot of hikers here. I got my laundry done, a shower and printed out my AT thru hiker permit. This park has a lot of weird rules. You have to stay in the shelters,unless they are full, then you can tent nearby. If your sleeping in the shelter and a non thru hiker comes you have to give up your spot.

I grabbed a spot in the shelter even though I much prefer the privacy of my tent. By seven o'clock the shelter was full and there were ten tents outside!

I am told that even though I missed 14 miles of the trail I will still be credited with a thru hike because the trail was closed due to forest fire . We arrived at Alan gap about 1030 and started to hike and immediately the rain kicked in. This was the first day on my hike when I hiked all day in the rain and I was soaked. We try to stop at a shelter but it was crammed with every hiker for 30 miles.So we stood in the rain and ate our lunch. Today I hiked with fellow hiker Shepard from Maine.

When I woke up this morning I found that I had water in my tent and my sleeping bag and half of my clothes were wet. Last night was the worst rain I've ever heard in a tent. It was so loud I could hardly hear myself think. Also sometime in the middle of the night a giant tree fell over and made a huge crash. I had images of that falling on my tent! So this morning I packed up all my wet gear put it in my bag and got back on the right trail headed in the right direction luckily it's not raining anymore. The good thing about the rain is probably really helped with the forest fires south of us. Today's 14.1 mile hike was particularly arduous.
