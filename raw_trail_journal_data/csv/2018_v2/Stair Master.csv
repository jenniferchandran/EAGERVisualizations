Saw one deer close, took my pics and video. Stopped at a camp ground off the trail for lunch and bought a premade sandwich and a coke. I was hiking at a good pace because the trail was mild with the ascents and descends. I did go to Big Meadows Wayside for supper also. I had a Philly steak grinder with fries and a coke. I left there and continued to hike to my intended shelter for tonight. I arrived here at 7:15 and cooked me some mashed potatoes with spam mixed together. Tomorrow's another day.","Hightop Hut
