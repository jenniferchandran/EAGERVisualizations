Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552084,"After several years of dreaming about an Appalachian Trail thru hike attempt, I'm taking the plunge and planning on joining the Class of 2018. Of all the components that have to come together for a successful thru hike, the one I should have covered is physical preparation. I currently day hike in the Rocky Mountains every few weeks traveling 12 miles round trip and gaining 3,500 feet of elevation. I plan on upping the number of hikes, miles, and weight carried as I go through the process of getting ready. Also, my Colorado cardio should help for at least the first couple of weeks until I acclimate to the lower altitude on the trail. I will be posting periodic updates during the run up to starting the hike in early 2018. If you would like to sign my guest book, I would love to hear from you.",,The Decision,"Dec 03, Sat",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552124,"I will elaborate on some common terms used by hikers over the next few entries. I mentioned yesterday that my intention is to thru hike the Appalachian Trail in 2018. What is a thru hike? A thru hike is walking the entire length of a trail usually in one 12 month period. The Appalachian Trail, or AT, is a nearly 2,200 mile trail that runs from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. The exact mileage of the AT changes slightly each year as re-routing projects are completed on the trail. There are many ways to thru hike the AT. The three most popular are northbound or NOBO from Georgia to Maine, southbound or SOBO from Maine to Georgia, and a hike that is becoming more popular, the flip-flop hike where you start at a point in the middle and walk to one of the ends, then go back to your original starting point and walk to the other end. NOBO is the most popular way to thru hike. As many as 75% of thru hikers are NOBO's. NOBO's may start as early as January in Georgia, but the bulk of NOBO's start in March or early April. Because of the long winter, SOBO's can't usually begin in Maine until early June.The total time an AT thru hike takes depends on the individual. Most AT thru hikers take 5 to 6 months to complete their hike. For most hikers, there is a shared tempo that is set by the spacing of shelters, camping areas and hostels along the trail. Shelters are usually about a day's hike apart, so groups of hikers that camp together one night, will tend to camp together the next night at the next shelter, even if they don't actually hike together. Hikers also take days off along the way, usually in a town. This is called a zero, because you accomplish zero miles that day. Often going into to town, or leaving town hikers record reduced mileage. A low mileage day is called a nero, because it's near zero miles.For my hike, I'm planning a NOBO hike starting probably in early February. The earlier you start, the worse the weather can be. There is actually some winter weather in the southern highlands. Temperatures at elevation can get to 20 degrees and lower at night. Snow is possible, sometimes quite heavy. Extreme cold, or a trail drifted over with snow might force me to hit pause on the hike for a few days. There are a couple of reasons I would like to start early. One is that it gives me more time to finish without having to do high mileage days and gives me a chance to take zeros when I feel like it. Another reason is that if I wait until the numbers of hikers leaving Georgia is at it's highest, I will be competing for resources with all the other hikers. That includes tent space at the shelters, hotel rooms in town, space at the hostels, and even rides to town. By the time hikers who started later catch up to me (and trust me, there will be plenty of 20 somethings who will catch up to me) the crowds will have thinned from people dropping out and the remaining people will be a little more spread out.If I can make good progress, I should be able to finish in mid to late July. Good progress is probably averaging 12 to 15 miles per day including zero and nero days.In future posts I will continue to go over background info on the AT, go over what gear I will be using, report on how my warm up hikes went.",,A thru hike,"Dec 04, Sun",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552226,"The most obvious question people have about thru hikers is why thru hike? Others may have some grand and deep reason for wanting to do it. I don't feel like it's my destiny or great purpose to do this. I'm not looking to find myself, and contrary to what some of my friends may think, this is not a mid life crisis. It's just something I've been interested in doing for a while and the opportunity has presented itself. If all goes well, I will summit Katahdin on or near my 54th birthday. I'm young enough that I have several potential hiking seasons to attempt the hike, but old enough that, going into it, I will treat this attempt as the only time I will try it. Statistics about thru hikes are not 100% accurate. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, about 25% of thru hikers successfully complete their hike. The two biggest demographic groups on the trail are recent graduates of either high school, or college, and retirees. I read once that the retirees actually have a higher completion rate than the recent grads. If that's true it's an indication that while the hike is a mammoth physical undertaking, there is also a big mental component. The retirees are motivated by the feeling that this is my one and only shot, while the younger hikers may decide to call it quits and resolve to come back and try again later in life.One of the reasons I started this journal 14 months prior to starting the hike is to make it more real and get me thinking about everything I must do to prepare. I want to be physically ready to hike by being in shape and carrying gear that is lightweight and appropriate for the use it's going to get, but I'm acutely aware that this will be a mental grind. Being fit doesn't help much with blisters, cold, heat, snow, rain, and mosquitos. When faced with several of these obstacles day after day it is important to find the on switch to start hiking and get the miles in each day. The famous thru hiker saying is, ""No rain, no pain, no Maine"".",,Why Thru Hike?,"Dec 07, Wed",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552677,"The Zin Mistress was nice enough to buy me AWOL's 2016 guidebook for Christmas. It's certainly packed full of useful information for a thru-hiker. Haven't decided if I will use the hard cover version or an electronic version for the hike, but this gives me an idea of what information is included and also size and weight of the hard cover edition. Most thru hikers who put the book in their back tear out pages as they complete them to reduce weight.Bad news for Zin Doggy yesterday. She was playing in my daughter's back yard with her dog and sliced open two of her paws on metal landscaping edging. So Christmas celebration was put on hold for a couple of hours for a trip to the 24 vet ER for stitches. She is resting comfortably now and seems to be on the mend. She can't wait to get back out and do some hiking with dad.",,A very Merry Christmas,"Dec 26, Mon",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553991,"Today I day hiked to Barr Camp and back. Barr Camp is half way up Pikes Peak at 10,200 feet of elevation. The camp was established in 1922 by Fred Barr, builder of the Barr Trail that runs from Manitou Springs westward to the summit of the mountain. The round trip hike to camp is 12 miles with an elevation gain of 3,500 feet. At camp I was able to visit with Aslhey and Nathan who are caretakers at the camp (and newlyweds). They, along with Ashley's brother Zach, handle the day to day operation of the camp providing information, coffee, and meals to hikers passing through and campers staying overnight, as well as acting as first responders to lost or injured hikers. I was also able to drop off a couple of loaves of whole wheat bread. Since retiring, it's been my practice to bake bread and then take it to camp for the caretakers. The picture with today's post is of the Pikes Peak summit. It was taken from Lighting Point, a rock out cropping and overlook just over 5 miles from the trailhead.",,Barr Camp Day Hike,"Jan 30, Mon",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554422,"Today I was hiking in downtown Chicago. Most people refer to it as walking. I'm worried that living in Colorado has ruined my mojo when it comes to handling cold weather. The temperature was near 30 degrees, but the damp overcast day chilled me to the bone. My fellow downtown hikers were an interesting group. Closed off, unemotional, looking hardened, they are the opposite of hikers that you typically encounter on a trail in the backcountry. What's on their mind as they navigate through the city? Mentally putting together a grocery list? Rehearsing in their head for the meeting they will lead at 2 o'clock? Dreaming of being in the woods? That last one is me and a handful of others. On the surface these urban warriors look like they can handle any adversity that life throws at them. The reality is that most would not be able to function in a wilderness area without outsourcing their survival decisions to someone more suited to the task.Though I can function in this concrete wilderness and to some extent even blend in, I think I would be a lot more at ease in the middle of nowhere carrying all of my life on my back. If all goes as planned, a year from now I will get a chance to live that dream.",,Urban Hiking,"Feb 08, Wed",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573617,"Finally back up to speed after eye surgery in March, it's time for a warmup hike. I'm hiking in Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park in the far northwest corner of Upper Michigan with my high school friend and occasional hiking partner, Peter. We made it to the area of the park last night and checked in getting our window sticker and backcountry camping permit. After that, it was back to the hotel for dinner, drinks, last minute pack checks, and more drinks. We had every intention of getting an early start this morning, but between sleeping in a little, breakfast, and the drive to the trailhead, it was 9:15 when we started hiking. The first trail we took on was the Union Spring Trail. Four miles long with, wait for it, the Union Spring in the middle. The Union Spring is one of the largest springs in Michigan and we had great a great view with the heavily overcast sky providing very little glare. The two miles to the spring were mostly a two track road walk through the woods. The road appeared to be used by equipment taking material into the backcountry to build group cabins. As we neared the spring the terrain changed abruptly. Goodbye wide road, hello skinny muddy trail with dozens of downed trees across. After taking a 15 minute break at the spring, we continued on. The next two miles were basically an obstacle course with many stations. Participants are asked to go over, under, and in some cases around all the downed trees. As we left the area around the spring, we saw a sign that said the trail ahead was ""ungroomed"". I have a deep appreciation for what that means now. After completing all the obstacles we went down a steep incline to a river which needed to be forded. Off go hiking boots and socks, on go the flip flops. The cold water felt great on the feet. Of all things to find on the other side of the river in a wilderness area, there was a bench, which we made use of to sit down and have lunch and regroup. Our next trail followed the river for nine tenths of a mile and took us past Trap Falls. We then took the Government Peak trail, to what else, Government Peak. Since this was a groomed trail, gone were the obstacles. However the mud stuck around, as did thousands of Michigan's unofficial state bird, the mosquito. After passing an impressive beaver lodge and pond, with corresponding flooded muddy trail, we ascended Government Peak and were rewarded with sunshine for the first time. After taking a short break and even getting cell service to get a couple of texts off we continued on. After another hour or so we came to the North Mirror Lake Trail and the final push for the day. When we arrived on the north side of Mirror Lake we found all the campsites to be occupied. We talked to one of the campers who told us he believed there were more sites on the other side of the lake. Sure enough, after hiking an additional half mile around the lake we were able to snag the last available site. We aren't right on the lake like the other sites, but a two minute walk down a hill gives us access. Which I used after dinner to fill my platypus bag and to splash off several hours of sweat and bug spray. So now after packing up my bear canister and walking it out into the woods, I'm settled in for the night. We covered 10 miles on day one, overcame several challenges and enjoyed some great sights along the way.",,View Entry,"Jul 21, Fri",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573678,"So yesterday my feet were talking to me - LOUDLY. I have a blister on each pinky toe. Not sure if I need to toughen up or try different boots. Resting overnight helped some, but they are still quite sore this morning. Based on that and talking to another hiker who said the Big Carp River trail was a great trail, we've decided to scale back our mileage today and take his trail recommendation. We had a very slow start this morning which I will blame on the thick gloomy fog that was enveloping the area. This was an improvement over last night's thunderstorms. The lightning kept its distance but we did get light to moderate rain on and off between midnight and two. We were finally packed up and moving around 10:15. The first order of business was the three mile long Correction Line trail. After making the initial climb out of the lake basin we settled into moderate ups and downs as we made our way through an area of mature forest with the occasional small stream crossing and frequent mud pits. It's too bad these mud pits exist. I get that there have been frequent heavy rains in the park causing the mud, but the hikers response is to try to go around the edge which only expands the size of the trail and the mud pits. And yes, we were often guilty of this because if I tried to go straight through like you are supposed to, I would have had mud and water over the tops of my boots. The park has placed boardwalks in some of the wetter areas, and this has kept the area adjacent to the trail from getting trampled. More of these boardwalks would allow the trail to heal. After completing the Correction Line trail, we stopped for lunch before starting down the Big Carp River Trail. This trail was more of the same muddy mess until we came to the river. The river was about 50 feet wide and, when we crossed it, about a foot deep. Switching to flip flops to ford the river felt awesome on sore hot feet. I made sure to take my sweet time in the water. Also it was about this time that the sun started coming out so between the warm sun and the cold water this was starting to feel like a vacation. Once across the river the socks and boots went back on and the vacation was over. We encountered a few more mud pits after the river, but soon the trail moved up to higher ground with sandy dry soil. Most of the rest of the way to Lake Superior the trail followed the river on a bluff 100 or so feet above the water. We enjoyed a great view of Shining Cloud Falls from the trail, as well as several rapids as the river spilled down over long smooth rock beds again and again. By the time we made it to the mouth of the river, my feet were once again in full rebellion. Peter was gracious enough to head south along the lake to scout for a campsite while I took a break at the site of the old bridge across the river. We had taken the new bridge across. The old bridge met its fate last year when the area received nine inches of rain in four hours and the swollen river swept the bridge away. After a few minutes, Peter returned without his gear and led me to the site he had found. Our site is right on Lake Superior. I mean if the waves kicked up, my tent would get wet. I'm set up twenty feet from the waterline. A giant bonus of being next to the lake and its fresh breeze is that there are virtually no bugs. At these lakeside sites the park has built wind breaks out of driftwood logs around the fire pits to make it possible to have a fire. We used this safe haven to set up the stove and cook dinner. Tonight's lake bath/splashdown took place balancing on boulders in the lake while negotiating the fairly heavy surf. I felt very refreshed after depositing a layer of sweat, bug spray, and mud in the big lake they call Gitchee Gumee. I'm settled in now for the night tired, sore, and having a great time.",,View Entry,"Jul 22, Sat",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573683,"We seem to be in a pattern. Thunderstorms overnight with dense fog in the morning. Last night's storms were a little closer than the previous night and the rain was a little more intense. Had I been asleep I probably wouldn't have heard the thunder over the crashing of the waves. However, that close to the shore the surf was loud and wasn't the white noise you would expect if you were set up farther inland. Occasionally waves would hit with more intensity or at a different angle to the shore and suddenly be quite loud. Not a good look for a light sleeper like myself. Also I've learned that the roof of my ZPacks tent is made of material that is REALLY LOUD when rained on. Finding out these things is why I'm doing this hike. I will definitely be packing ear plugs next year on the AT. Another pattern we are in is starting to hike after 10 am. Maybe the lack of good sleep during the night is causing me to sleep in, or it really is hard to get motivated on gloomy, foggy mornings. Once we were on our way, we crossed the bridge over the Big Carp River and headed northeast on the Lake Superior trail, which runs along you guessed it, Lake Superior. We were warned that the LST had lots of mud. No problem, right? We've seen lots of mud in two days in the park. How bad could it be?  The answer is, much worse. Occasionally the trail hugged the shoreline and we walked on loose softball sized boulders. When the trail made its way inland a little, the fun began. Gone were the quaint little 20 foot diameter mud pits. Now we were faced with quagmires 50 to 100 yards long with standing water throughout most of their length. Weirdly, these wet areas had virtually no mosquitoes. We didn't need bug spray, and I didn't need to pull my buff over my head like Cornholio to keep the bugs from trying to fly into one ear, though the empty space in my head and out the other ear. These mud pits did a number on my already sore feet. I was left with a choice of rock and root hopping to stay less muddy - ouch. Or slog down the middle and run the risk of bashing into or tripping on said rocks and roots - ouch. I opted for selective hopping using my hiking stick for balance and to find stepping stones and roots. Along the way I started noticing that my two original blisters had successfully recruited friends. My big toes definitely had joined the party and a couple of others on each foot had developed hot spots. When we came to an open campsite about 5 miles from where we started, we jumped on it. This is actually a double site, with the other side being occupied by a group of teenagers from Midland Michigan. They could have easily taken both sites, so we were very grateful they squeezed into one and left the other for us. This site is set back about 40 to 50 feet from the shore and separated from the water by a natural berm that acts as both a wind break and sound break. The sea is a little angrier here. The surf is more active and the walk to the water is down a treacherous slope of loose rocks. Since Peter is using a hand pump water filter, I became the designated water gatherer since it was easier for me to wait for a wave and scoop water into my platypus bag than it would be for him to try to filter at the shoreline. Then, since my Sawyer mini filter wasn't sealing well on the bag we used his pump filter to purify the water. Dinner was the best yet - AlpineAire Thai Chicken with Noodles. Delicious!  This is the second AlpineAire meal I've had. They are tasty and tend to be a little cheaper than Mountain House. Last night I did freezer bag cooking to make sour cream and chive mashed potatoes, to which I added chicken breast. Also very tasty. A front came through late this afternoon clearing away the clouds and dropping the temperature. Looking forward to a great night's sleep in the cool air with the waves providing background noise.",,View Entry,"Jul 23, Sun",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573689,"We were badass early risers this morning. We made a pact last night to be up by 7. I was eating my pop tart breakfast at 6:45 in my tent. By the way, almost every hiker I've ever read about has included pop tarts in their food consumption. I have never heard anyone say their pop tarts got smashed to bits in their food bag. I'm not complaining, they were still tasty, I'm just wondering if I'm the only dumbass who took them out of the box to save weight. Anyway, our new found early riser ways allowed us to hit the trail by 8:30. Yesterday was easily the muddiest day of hiking we had.  Until today. Today the trail conjured up a greatest hits of long muddy areas and downed trees to negotiate. On fresh legs, with a good night's sleep, we were not deterred. Of interest this morning was the uptick in wildlife sightings, namely a dozen or so grouse flying up suddenly as we nearly stepped on them. Until today we had only seen one deer and about 50 toads, oh and the trout that was nipping at my legs while I was washing up in Mirror Lake the first night. Also of note was an extremely large area of downed trees, perhaps greater than a quarter mile in diameter. In addition to the heavy rain storm last year, the park also had a high wind storm a few weeks later that probably knocked a lot of the trees down that we dealt with day one plus several large ones we had seen since. This area, though, was another level. The wind storm was said to be straight line winds, but to my eye this looked like a small tornado had hit. Virtually every tree seemed to be down, many in impenetrable stacks 8 feet and higher. The effort to reopen the trail using chainsaws must have been monumental. Most of the tough conditions were behind us after about 2 and a half miles when the trail turned away from the lake and started heading uphill towards highway M-107. The climb was what my Colorado lungs were built for. The Porcupine Mountains aren't mountains in the Rocky Mountain sense. The highest point in the park is about 1,850 above sea level. They are mountains, though when you consider how sudden and steeply they rise up from the surrounding land, or in this case, lake. I'm guessing we climbed 800 feet in about 2 miles with several very steep spots. We had originally intended to go a couple of days longer, but upon reaching the highway, decided to try to find a ride 10 miles back to the car. As I suspected, most midwestern people are able to ignore a hitchhiker on the side of the highway and even manage to avoid eye contact. So I left my backpack with Peter, and walked the mile up to the Lake of the Clouds parking lot where I was able to secure a ride with the second couple I approached. They were awesome to give us a ride and were going right past my car anyway, so we weren't inconveniencing them at all. With our early start and good fortune getting a ride we were able to get into Ontonogan and have lunch. I don't think I had actual hiker hunger after only 4 days hiking, but I had no trouble demolishing a large burger and fries. Now I'm in Iron Mountain staying overnight with friends. Laundry, check. Shower, check. American Ninja Warrior, check. Up early tomorrow to begin the drive back to Colorado Springs.",,View Entry,"Jul 24, Mon",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581823,"My thru hike is starting to become all too real.  There are less than three weeks now until I begin
on Springer Mountain.  I have all the
usual pre-thru hike emotions:  fear,
anxiety, anticipation, excitement.  Since
action feels better than waiting, part of me wants to start right now.  However, seeing sub-zero wind chills in the forecast
for the north Georgia mountains this week has given me some patience.  Hopefully the weather will moderate a little
in the coming days.  I’m focusing on the
actions I can take now: getting my gear finalized and my backpack arranged the
way I want it; finalizing my food selections for the first few days; setting up
a mail drop that can be sent to me a couple of weeks into the hike; getting my
affairs in order so my wife doesn’t go mental trying to hold the fort down in
my absence.
One thing I’ve picked up on from the dozens of hiker journals
I’ve read is that how they thought the hike would go is out the window early
on.  With that in mind, I’m focusing more
on making sure I have the gear, supplies, and mental attitude I need to get
through the first few weeks on the trail. 
Gear will evolve, food choices will change, and hiker hacks will be
learned.  What that means is that it’s
more important to be able to adapt to changing conditions and keep moving
forward than it is to focus on trying to get everything right up front.
I’ve had several comments and questions about cold weather
at the beginning of the journey.  I think
a lot of hikers who start in March and even into April are surprised at how
cold the southern highlands are in early spring.  With my January start, temperatures in the
teens and single digits at night are possible and so is snow.  Because of this, I’ve put a lot of thought
into assembling gear and clothing that will keep me warm and dry.  Ultimately, it’s likely that I may head into
town for a couple of days at some point to avoid a snow storm, or extreme
cold.  I feel it’s worth the
inconvenience to get ahead of the hiker bubble that will fill the campsites and
hostels starting in March.

Griswald look like a wuss given the amount of planning and preparation he's done.   I have something to compare that to  = I'm a project manager so I get making a plan and then knowing you need plan B-Z because A goes up in flames even with the best planning.So let me answer a few questions for you as I seem to get the same questions over and over:  1.  Will he carry a gun to protect himself?   No, he won't.   They're heavy -weight is critical.   You're crossing state lines - just trying to understand and navigate what that would mean to carry a firearm would be daunting.   If you read all you can about hiking the trail, your fellow travelers tell you what to watch out for, where to be careful etc.  2.   Are you ok with him being gone for 6 months?    This is his dream...what right to I have to deprive him of that.   He's always been my biggest supporter, why would I not be his if this is something he really wants to do.    It's not like he woke up yesterday and put his workout clothes on and said I'm going to take a walk for 6 months.  He's prepared, he's planned and having been with him for more than 30 years I trust him.    Don't get me wrong, it's scary for me.     I look at this as my opportunity to grow too.   He needs me to be a cheerleader and not Debby Downer.    3.  Why aren't you hiking with him?   I can physically do it.   It's not my dream to do it.   It would be something that I would turn into more of a hurry it up and get through it focus on getting to the end kind of thing and missing all the beauty in between.    That would take away from his dream.   It will be hard for him to push through sometimes.  He doesn't need my sorry ass dragging him down because he's worried about me.4.  Will you meet him while he's hiking?   Absolutely, that's the plan.  He's reviewed the trail and we've identified some spots that he thinks we'd both enjoy hiking together.  We hike now on a regular basis, just not these long stretches.  I'll be watching, listening, texting and sharing his story far and wide so we can all cheer him on when it seems like he wants to quit or something to look forward to reading posts letting him know the outside world is watching and cheering him on.More to come as we continue to prepare for the big adventure ....Peaches",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Tue",0

What's the right dress for me - not too long, not too frilly but still girly, the right color, just the right cut and size so I look small and sleek.   Tent, sleeping bag, clothes purchases - not too big, not too heavy, easy to put up/away, not too bulky, fits well - see even he doesn't want anyone to answer the yes to the question,""Do I look fat in this""?    2.Finding the right shoes - for me color, style, heel height (I'm 5"" tall).  For Zin - the right size (he's got huge feet), keep his feet warm, waterproof, comfortable to walk in forever, sturdy.   Our goals were different but the search and importance was key.  Of course, we girls tend to toss our shoes off half way through the crazy dancing so less about comfort but more about appearance.3.  The accessories - earrings, necklace, purse, flowers for me - what will bring the whole picture together so I look fabulous.  Zin - waterproof pouches in various sizes to cover/protect important things, rainproof gear and covers so all the other ""stuff"" doesn't get wet, and let us not forget his flame designed gators to bring it all together!4.  Where you'll eat, what you'll eat, how you'll get there, where to meet your friends - we both planned, discuss with others going to figure out the best things to do, got some tips on what where there was  good food, what was affordable, how best to get from one place to another and places to meet up with others.    Side note:   If any of you reading this who are thinking of or are in the process of planning to go, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to reach out to other thru hikers who have gone before you.    Part of the piece of mind I have with Zin leaving is that the hiker community is an unbelievably supportive and helpful crew of people.   Not so much when I was planning my prom adventure - if I had a more helpful group of resources I wouldn't have ended up having a dinner I had to eat with my hands (pizza) vs a really nice sit down experience :)So, he's ready for his prom now.   A few minor things to go and then to pack it all together.   Still exciting, still a bit scary but always happy to see him follow through with his dream.  Until next post,   Peaches",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Fri",0

forgets his hiking boots.  The list was
long, but very helpful.  Using the list, I
was able to lay everything out that needed to go in my pack.  This immediately induced panic because it
didn’t look physically possible to fit everything I wanted to take into my backpack.  If I’m going to be successful on this
journey, I will need to press on through uncertainty and deal with whatever
happens.  So, I started loading the large
unruly mass of gear and clothing I had accumulated.  It soon became evident that not only was all
this stuff going to fit, but that my pack wasn’t going to be stretched to the point
of exploding in the process.  I’m close
now to having my pack just about ready.  Once I have everything loaded I will figure
out what my base weight is and then go over every item looking for weight
savings and opportunities for more efficient packing.  
I’m sure if there are any past thru hikers reading this,
they are smiling thinking back to when they were a neurotic mess prior to
getting started.  I will probably chuckle
about it myself a couple of weeks into the hike.  But for now, I’m excited to be entering the
final phase of preparation and can’t wait to finally get started on this
adventure that I’ve been preparing for these past 14 months.Zin Master""The journey is the reward.""",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Mon",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582240,"Peaches and I are currently making our way east through Kansas. She’s driving, though technically it might be safe for me to type and drive in Kansas since the average straight stretch of highway is approximately 600 miles long here. The forecast for Monday in north Georgia is 80% chance of rain and thunderstorms. Welcome to the AT. Despite that, I’m anxious to get going. Waiting for day one is tough. Once I hit the trail I’ll be fine. Then I can focus on making miles and camp chores. Until then this drive is certainly quite relaxing. 
The plan is to get as far as we can tonight, hopefully southern Illinois or Kentucky then do the rest tomorrow. Peaches has her raincoat so she is still planning on walking the first mile with me Monday morning. Hopefully we can hit a weather window to take the iconic picture of the plaque on top of Springer.Zin Master“The journey is the reward”",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Sat",0
Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582286,"Zin and I just spent the last day and a half traveling across the country to get to Springer Mountain, GA to start the hike.  Needless to say, I'm suffering from a case of car butt but we've at least reached our destination - Amicalola Falls State Park.   We're spending the night at the Lodge - his last night of luxury before the adventure begins.    
Having made good time, we were able to grab lunch and do a bit of hiking down the 600 stairs next to the Falls to the visitors center where we could take Zin's picture at the entrance to the Approach Trail and he could sign in and get his hiker # for the trail - He's #17.
The past few weeks have been doing a lot of preparation for him and with me trying to help as best I could.   For those of you supporting a thru hiker here are a few of the things we did together as we prepared for the next 6 months apart.
1.  Made lists....lots of lists.    What tasks needed to be done while he was gone - vet trips, turn on the sprinklers, service the cars.  What his schedule was for doing some of those ""once in awhile"" tasks like cleaning the light fixtures, the top of the cupboards, wiping down baseboards etc.   He's been retired so he does a lot of things around the house so I can work and then we can spend time together when I'm done.  I'll need to pick up the slack now.
2.  Reviewed what I need to do with our taxes this year.   Zin's an Accountant so he took care of these things.   I am by degree as well but hate taxes with a passion beyond compare.     Here's where # 1 comes in handy - he made a list of what documents I need so I can check them off as they come in so I know I have everything.
3.  Discuss where you want to meet while you have a thru hiker on the trail.    I work full time and travel some of the time for work so it's not quite so simple for me to just pick up and go.  I need to coordinate a pet sitter, make sure the world is not going to explode at work while I'm gone. I'm not irreplaceable but it seems that the chaos seems to kick in just before I'm about to go somewhere and I hate burdening others with the mess.    I'm physically able to do the trail but I inherently have a phobia of being a burden to Zin or slowing him down as well of things that can be a physical challenge to me at my height.   We talked about spots that were pretty and not overly intimidating but know that in my heart I should be at the start and at the end.   Again, he made me a list of place and estimated dates so I can decide what makes sense and fits what's going on at home/work while he's away.  
4.  Make sure you understand, in general, where your thru hiker is going to be.   I say in general because you don't know whether they are going to have to take a zero day, it's just a crappy day for hiking (mentally, physically, weather/trail wise) or some other reason.    I don't want to be in panic mode if I don't hear from him in 2-3 days so I know he'll let me know when I may not hear from him for a bit.   We've heard reception with Verizon is pretty good on the trail so we're hoping to at least get a quick check in text daily when he's on the trail.   I've also got a copy of the AT trail guide that I can follow him along via the guide.
5.  Discuss whether they do or do not want care packages.   Zin is a bit iffy on this so we know there will be a few that he wants  to have like his 1st resupply and when he needs new hiking boots (he's got big feet so finding his size in an outfitter isn't likely so we already have another pair on hand that I can send).
6.  Build up the hype for your hiker.  There are going to be some rough days ahead for your hiker.    They need motivation sometimes.   Each is unique in what works for them.  Zin looks at having a following as a means of holding him accountable to finish.  He doesn't want to disappoint anyone, including himself.    He's pasted a link to his journal on facebook as will I so all of my contacts can follow along as well.   I've included it in my Christmas cards, shared it in my out of office message as I drive him to GA and take a week off to visit my parents and make the drive back home to Colorado.   I tell anyone and everyone that he's doing it as much as I can so we can cheer him along when he needs it.    
7.  Make sure you have a support group watching out for you as well.  I have no issue being alone; I'm a fairly independent person.  Sometimes too much.   We let my neighbors know Ken's going.    Bless his heart, Cliff, my neighbor, who does security has said to call anytime day or night even if I just hear a weird sound.  He'll take care of any major snow removal or any of the tasks around the house that I might need some help with.  So has Rich on the other side.   I know I'm not alone.    We're relatively new to Colorado so we don't have the great bunch of friends from the neighborhood that we had in Wisconsin so it will be a bit lonely for me but I'll find ways to keep occupied.  I've got my lovely Australian Shepard Moxie to walk and talk to ask well as Lumpy the cat who is usually a bag of entertainment as well.    I might turn into the crazy lady you make eye contact in the store and know that if you approach me I'm going to start talking to you so you avert your eyes and scamper down another aisle to avoid me :)   I have my daughter and son in law and of course when I travel my work friends who are always there for me too.  
8.  Be sure to talk to each other about your fears, concerns, and all the good moments along the way.   It's his dream and I'm 110% in his corner but it scares me as well.  There are going to be new things for me too so it makes the adventure something that we'll both grow as people by the end.   He knows what scares me and I know what scares him.   If he can do this; whatever I'm facing is fairly insignificant even if it feels overwhelming to me.
9.  Put your financial house in order.   I've always taken care of the bills so that was a no brainer for us but if you haven't, go back to #1 and make lists -what needs to be paid and when.  Don't forget little things like insurance, property taxes, income taxes, regular monthly bills, car payments, mortgages etc.    He has a life insurance policy - I know where it is and we know the premium is up to date.  Neither of us plan on a major catastrophe, but being prepared is never a bad idea - thru hiker or no thru hiker.   I know where the titles to the cars are and where all of our retirement information is so I can manage that in his absence.  If you aren't comfortable with these tasks, find someone you know and trust who can help.   
10.  Last but not least, tell your hiker you love them, believe in them and you're there with them every step of the way in anyway that you need you to be.   
You'll hear from us soon as the real journey begins!     It's a long journey - take small steps but dream big!!!

Fog on the English Channel forced Eisenhower to postpone the invasion. Likewise, my assault on the AT will have a 24 hour weather delay. Severe thunderstorms are forecast for tomorrow night in north Georgia, so I’m waiting one more day to start. I don’t plan on cowering indoors for every weather situation, but if I can easily avoid a strong rain or snow storm I will whether its day 1 or day 151. It’s not easy to be this physically close to starting and have to wait a little longer. Hopefully this will make me want it all that much more. We’re staying tonight at the Lodge at Amicalola Falls State Park. This is a very nice facility with great views of the surrounding mountains from its lobby and porch. The lodge is at the top of the falls. This afternoon we were probably the only dumbasses who went down the 600 stairs to the visitor center then hiked back up. The hike back to the lodge was 850 vertical feet. That’s twice the vertical Peaches and I will be doing up Springer on Tuesday, so we feel ready for the first mountain.  At the visitor center, Peaches took my picture under the iconic arch at the start of the AT approach trail. Inside the visitors center I signed up as an AT thru hiker. I am the 17th thru hiker to sign the log in 2018. I don’t think I’ve ever been ranked in the top 20 nationally in anything before so that was cool. My odds of being one of the first 17 hikers to Harpers Ferry or Katahdin are pretty much non-existent. Tomorrow I will unpack and repack for the last time.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582372,"What a fantastic first day!  Waiting out the weather paid off big. Not a cloud in the sky all day. It was a little chilly but that meant not much sweating. 
The day started with the drive from the Amicalola Falls Lodge to Springer Mountain. Peaches and I took the forest service road to where it intercepts the AT at northbound mile 1. We then walked trail southbound to the top of Springer where we took pictures of the AT plaque and the first white blaze. I did the trip up and down Springer as a slackpack, meaning I didn’t carry my backpack on that portion. When we got back to the car at mile 1, I said goodbye to Peaches and she headed off to her parents house in Kingsport Tennessee. I’m so blessed to have such a wonderful wife willing to share starting this journey with me. 
As I said the weather was spectacular for hiking today. The terrain was easy with the worst uphill portion being the last mile before where I stopped. I stopped off at Stover Creek Shelter around noon for a snack and to sit down for a few minutes at the picnic table.   A couple of miles later I came to a footbridge crossing a large stream and decided to sit down and have lunch. All was well until when I was packing up to get started again, when out of the corner of my eye I saw a good sized animal running right at me. I didn’t scream like a girl but I did let out some kind of startled sound that I don’t have words to describe. Luckily the animal in question was a very friendly dog whose owner was close behind. Two ladies were out taking a day hike with their dogs. Turns out that they were originally from Alpena Michigan which is about 90 miles from where I grew up in northern Michigan. These two ladies were the first and only humans I saw all day. 
I’m currently settled into my sleeping bag inside my tent at the Hawk Mountain campsite. This site was built in 2016 and has 30 tent pads, 3 bear boxes, and a privy. I believe it was developed to help handle the influx of northbound thru hikers who start in March. To my knowledge I’m the only one here tonight. After setting up camp I made my dinner, 3 cheese chicken pasta with zucchini. Yummy. Looking forward to what tomorrow brings.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582379,"Much more challenging day today. Last night was COLD. I don’t carry a thermometer but it was probably in the 20’s. Where my breath had condensed on the roof of the tent it had formed ice crystals which fell like snow this morning as I moved around getting ready. I was warm enough in my sleeping bag though I didn’t sleep much which is my usual pattern the first night I’m in the woods. 
This morning I learned a valuable lesson while packing up in the cold — STAY WARM!  This may seem obvious, but in my hurry to get going I had my gloves off for too long and they turned into blocks of ice. It got worse when they finally thawed out and hurt so bad I thought I was going to puke or faint. Also I couldn’t feel my toes when I started hiking but that cleared up quickly once I had gone a quarter mile or so. Needless to say as soon as I came to an exposed area facing the morning sun and out of the wind, I took the opportunity to bask on a rock and warm up. So to the extent possible in the future, I will be keeping my gloves on while packing and stopping to warm them up if they are getting cold. Also I’m making a point of airing out my hiking clothes overnight so they have a fighting chance to be dry when I put them back on in the morning. Airing them out won’t be a problem tonight. I’m staying in a shelter and there are several pegs for hanging backpacks which I’m going to use as my clothesline. I was going to tent here, but the Forest Service has closed all the tenting areas for revegetation. That will help speed up the packing process in the morning with no tent to break down. 
The terrain today was also challenging. Several steep climbs including Sassafras Mountain which I had been warned about by Bigfoot in his 2016 YouTube series.  I broke the tip of one of my hiking poles clean off today when I lost my footing and stepped up it. I’ll have to see if it can be fixed when I’m at the outfitter on Friday. 
Thankfully it was another awesome sunny day. The temps and wind chill dropped in the afternoon, but that was what the forecast said. Tomorrow and tomorrow night are supposed to be warmer. 
Ok time to make my dinner and get ready to hit the sack. Oh yeah, I tried uploading pictures to trail journals today, but I wasn’t able to. I may have to monkey around with it when I have wi-fi. Zin Master“The journey is the reward”","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582415,"Last night I slept in a shelter because I thought the surrounding tent sites were closed. I figured out this morning that most sites are open, but I was probably warmer in the shelter sleeping up off the ground. The AT shelters are notorious for their mice and this one did not disappoint. I listened to lots of activity throughout the night culminating in a mouse running across my head. Pretty much every thru hiker has had this experience, so check off another milestone. 
Another milestone I achieved today were my first official blisters. I will be working on improving that situation tomorrow morning. My stopping point tomorrow will be at Mountain Crossings Hostel at Neel Gap. Depending on the blister prognosis, I may spend a couple days there to heal up.   My feet are the only thing giving me trouble right now so I would like to address them and move past the issue. I had some shoulder pain yesterday so when I got to the shelter I took my first vitamin I (ibuprofen). Worked like a charm. The pain went away so I could sleep well and didn’t return today. 
A new feature of the trail today is people!  I encountered a dozen or so people today including a group of SOBO’s who started last summer and will be finishing tomorrow. A SOBO is hiker lingo for Southbound hiker. I’m a NOBO because I’m heading north. Also today I met two young ladies who were day hiking up a particularly steep section. When we topped out at an overlook we sat down to enjoy the view and catch our breath. I must have had my mad Yogi-ing skills on display because one of the women offered me a bottle of water. Yogi-Ing is when you are able to get someone to give you something without asking for it directly like Yogi bear. 
Another great weather day. At times it was chilly usually on downhills that were exposed to the wind. So I took my puffy jacket on and off several times. Tonight I’m settled in my tent about to turn in. Looking forward to a shower and some decadent food tomorrow!

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582438,"The temperature last night must have been right around freezing. The ground sparkled with a little frost this morning, but inside my tent the roof was wet from where my breath condensed over night. The Lance Creek campsite was interesting. Apparently the area was trashed last fall by a hurricane. It’s open now, but there was a lot of work done to clear all the downed trees from the campsites. Many of the trees still strewn around the site exceeded two feet in diameter and were easily 40 feet long. 
The big item on today’s agenda was climbing Blood Mountain. At 4,400 feet, Blood Mountain is the highest point on the AT in Georgia. That’s over 1,500 higher than where I started this morning. So the morning consisted of several small climbs over foothills leading to the final 800 foot ascent of Blood. I ran into many day hikers on Blood because it is located two miles from a highway. 
It was chilly all day long so I left my puffy jacket on all day. I got a little sweaty on the foothills but figured that was better than being wet and cold without a jacket. Sweat wasn’t an issue on Blood, because the temperature was much colder and the wind much stronger. 
Once again today I was plagued by blisters on my feet. I started strong and was averaging 2 miles an hour for the first time on this hike even though the trail was mostly uphill. But after 3 or 4 miles I was feeling a return of acute pain and by the time I reached the summit of the mountain I was pretty miserable. The trek down made matters worse as the first mile or so is steep and rocky and my blistered toes were being pushed into the toe of my boots with the additional force of gravity. 
I eventually made it to Mountain Crossings, an outfitter and hostel at Neel’s Gap. There, Jason did a pack shakedown with me and he only came up with 2 items for me to consider discarding. He also gave me some tips on how to deal with the blister issue. I’m heading to my in-laws house in Tennessee tomorrow to recuperate for a few days. I’m not stopping, just pausing. I’m having a great time and can’t wait to get back to the trail and continue, but I need to deal with this issue and get it put behind me so I can get the most out of this experience.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582456,"Today’s highlight is a ten hour 3 bus Greyhound trip to Johnson City, Tennessee. I stayed last night at Blood Mountain Cabins at Neel Gap. There are signs on the trail that say “Neel Gap,” and others that say “Neel’s Gap.”  Not sure which is correct, so maybe I will alternate like the Forest Service does. After getting checked into my cabin I found out that to get food I had to head back up the hill to Mountain Crossings. My feet thought this was boolsheet. I also needed to get better internet signal or wi-fi to plan today’s travel, so off I went.  While I was struggling with Greyhound’s mobile site trying to see what my options were, a young man (whose name is Pretzel— love these trail names) came out of the store and asked if I needed a ride to Gainesville because he could shuttle me there. I said sure but I need to figure out what’s going on with the bus. He said he understood and was aware it was hard to book tickets using a phone on Greyhound’s site, so he ran into the bunkhouse to get his laptop that he was charging and he was able to bring up a working reservation system for Greyhound. After booking the trip and making arrangements with Pretzel for when to pick me up in the morning, I got down to business strapping on a feed bag. I picked up a supreme frozen pizza, and the young lady at the counter asked if I needed any other goodies. Hmmm, you know in fact I do. Sausage egg muffin for tomorrow morning, two 20 ounce diet cokes, and two packages of Reese’s cups. I explained that I don’t have hiker hunger yet, I’m just a pig. 
The ride with Pretzel this morning was great. He thru hiked the AT in 2012, and the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) in 2015. He had a lot of great advice and observations for me and assured me I was doing the right thing to get off trail for a few days. So now I’m on the bus heading for Tennessee. I would feel better if Pretzel had been able to shuttle me all the way to my destination. I’m pretty sure Greyhound’s corporate motto is “We’re trying to be as friendly as the Department of Motor Vehicles.”  In theory I will get where I’m going tonight, but if not, I’m prepared to live just about anywhere out of my backpack.Zin Master“The journey is the reward”","Neel Gap

At Mahoney’s in Johnson City I was helped by Britt who is a very knowledgeable fellow hiker. We concluded that right now my feet are too jacked up and it would be inappropriate to make a decision on new boots until things settle down. We agreed that my size 13 orthotic inserts need to be upsized to 14 to fit better in the larger boots I need. So tomorrow I will attempt to find a local podiatrist who will re-cover the inserts based on size 14. To resolve the problem with the broken tip on my hiking pole, I will need to wait until the Leki customer service line opens  tomorrow morning. Biggest lesson learned today: by law you can not buy wine in Tennessee on Sunday.

They should be a better fit for my new boots, which I ordered today at the outfitter. I’ve worn a size 13 shoe going back to when I was in high school. For this hike, I upsized to size 14. Based on how beat to shit my feet were after only 30 miles that wasn’t enough. After I trying on the Keen size 14’s today, I didn’t feel comfortable with the fit I was experiencing. Keep in mind this was at the store with non-swollen feet, so I was already thinking about what would happen after hiking a few miles. Somewhere between 2 and 5 miles feet begin to swell and shoes that worked fine previously start blistering your feet. I decided to order out 14 wide boots. My problem is that my feet are wider than normal at the toes. The extra width that I will get should keep my toes from getting so constricted. There is a possibility that more room inside the shoes could equal movement within the boot and therefore blisters. But the standard width boots seemed like a sure fire way to more blisters. I can deal with a little too big. Nearly impossible to deal with too small. When these new boots arrive I will be upsized in both length and width.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582660,"I commend anyone sticking with this trail journal with all of its entries from off the trail. There was a question and some comments on the guest book alluding to cold weather and my winter start, so I will use that subject as an opportunity to talk trail. 
First of all let’s be clear: hiking and camping in cold weather falls under the heading Don’t try this at home. Before attempting this, know what you and your equipment are capable of handling. If you live in an area where 20 degrees is considered cold, will you be ready to live outside when it’s getting down into the 20’s at night?  It’s important to understand the difference between the coldest weather you can tolerate and what you can live in 24 hours a day. I have tolerated temperatures lower than -15F, when I’ve been properly dressed and had a heated building to go into and warm up. There’s no way I could live outside for several days at a time in those conditions. Know the early signs of hypothermia and frostbite and take immediate corrective action if they occur. Cold and moisture don’t mix. STAY DRY!  I carry one set of clothes to hike in and one set for camp to sleep in. My camp clothes are intended to stay dry and keep me warm when the temperature drops. 
What you wear is your first line of defense against cold. I’m probably speaking to hikers who know this, but it’s worth saying: Do not take cotton clothing into the backcountry. Cotton absorbs moisture and stays wet a long time, potentially keeping your skin wet.  Polyester and wool are excellent choices. Wool has the added benefit of retaining most of its insulating properties even when wet. You should have a functioning layering system and know how to use it. Layering does not mean randomly adding more and more layers of clothing. You should have a moisture wicking base layer that can efficiently take sweat away from your skin. A mid layer with thermal properties comes next. Finally some kind of outer shell layer. For me, this is a long sleeve Minus 33 polyester shirt, a Patagonia mid-layer hoodie, and a Patagonia puffy jacket. I also have the option of an Outdoor Research hooded rain jacket which is fairly heavy and will stop rain well and can provide some protection against wind. So far, I’ve hiked in either my base layer only, or base layer and puffy. I’ve used my Patagonia hoodie at camp after changing into my dry base layer. This set up has worked for me in wind chills that were probably in the teens. If it gets colder than that where I need my mid-layer to stay warm while hiking, I will head to the nearest town even if that means hiking in reverse to get to a road crossing. As my Blood Mountain pic shows, I’m rocking the dead sexy Under Armor leggings with shorts on top. This has been warm enough for me, and at times slightly too warm. At camp, I trade dry, lined Mountain Hardware pants for the leggings and shorts. I hike in a pair of Darn Tough socks and then change into a dry pair at camp. When I restart the hike, I will add a second pair of Darn Toughs for hiking so that I can change into a dry pair of socks mid-day to combat blisters. A wool beanie, glove liners, and heavy winter gloves, complete the hiking outfit. The hat and gloves go on and off during the day as conditions dictate. Again, I have a dry hat and gloves to change into at camp. 
I also need a warm place to sleep. My ZPacks tent is ultra-light, and at best a three season tent. That being said, if I’m set up protected from the wind, I can get a few degrees of warmup over the outside air temperature. My ZPacks sleeping bag is rated to 10F. I have a silk liner that acts as added thermal protection. And I’m set up on a Therm-a-Rest pad that provides some additional insulation vs. setting up directly on the ground. Sleeping bag ratings are used to sell sleeping bags. They are a rough indicator of what the bag is capable of handling. I don’t take 10 degrees as the gospel. I know I’m fine in the 20’s, but I’m not overly interested in seeing how cold I can survive. If it’s colder than 20 or so, I plan on being in a hotel eating pizza. 
What this all comes down to is being prepared and setting limits. Know how far you can take things safely. Know where the road crossings are, and have an exit strategy in mind. Know the forecast for temperature, rain, and wind; all factor into what you will need to do to stay warm. Start out in the morning hiking colder than what’s comfortable so that when you get going and warm up you are not sweating profusely from being overdressed. Above all, stay safe and if you are not sure if you are ready for the conditions you will encounter, wait for the conditions to improve. The trail will always be there.Zin Master“The journey is the reward.”","Kingsport Tennessee

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582685,"Being forced off trail by injury and being a house guest for an extended period has been a struggle for me. Part of the struggle is a longing to be on the trail and to experience this journey. Part of the struggle is maintaining a sense of relevance and purpose. Without something to do I will quickly devolve into non-stop TV viewing and internet surfing. To keep busy today I baked four loaves of bread and put together a shelf. I mention what I do each day to document it, but also to paint a picture for potential thru hikers of what your experience may be like if you sustain an injury. I consider my injury to be self inflicted. As much preparation as I put into this hike, I neglected to get my footwear right and now I’m paying for it with a forced stop to heal and reconfigure my gear. I’ve been blessed to have family relatively nearby who I can stay with while I go through this process. Without them I would have been forced to return to Colorado putting the entire hike in jeopardy. My advice to future thru hikers would be to make sure you have all your bases covered before you start. The trail will expose your weaknesses.

The highlights: unpacking and setting up a new toaster oven, and mounting the outside sensor for a new indoor/outdoor thermometer. I also learned that the reverse of the bus ride that I took to get here will be a 20 hour odyssey with a 10 hour overnight layover in Atlanta. As much as I’m excited about spending the night in a big city bus station, or alternatively spending at least $200 for a downtown Atlanta  hotel, I decided to look into renting a car. Best news of the day is that for a few dollars more than a bus ticket I can rent a car and drive myself to within 13 miles of Neel Gap in less than 4 hours.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582720,"Peaches here.   It's been about a week now that I've had to figure out the daily routine and get acclimated to being on my own while Zin is on the trail or camped out at my folks.    Moximillion, Lumpy and I seem to have found our groove but it's only a week.
A few things have helped make the acclimation easier for me.   
 Zin did a few smaller test hikes that had me on my own.   It was a good way to test the waters and see how my working from home, doing chores, taking care of the critters and handling any unforeseen things played out.   
 We talked through what my role should be for him - what did he need from me.  First and foremost, in no uncertain terms, i needed to completely support this adventure and not decide half way through this wasn't for me.    We know it will be hard.    He had me read articles about other couples and what they did so I could get perspective.   I'm all in.   My role is and will continue to be head cheerleader for Zin.   For those of you reading this, it's also your role.   I've been with him for 35+ years so I imagine sometimes my encouragement translates to a conversation with Charlie Brown's teacher - wawawa.   
I'll send resupply stuff his way when and where he wants me to.
 I have a support network in place.   The kids take care of the house and pets if I travel.   Cliff, our wonderful neighbor, who does security keeps an eye on me and the house to watch for anything sketchy.  I let folks know where I will be and when.   I can call any time of day or night and he'll be in here in a minute even if I hear something scary.   I'm not quite that spookish but good to know.   I know of companies who can do services around the house like yard maintenance or things I don't know how to do or again the wonderful neighbors will help.    Sometimes I'll try to do things on my own.  Whether I should or not comes down to being too stubborn to bother others - I hate to inconvenience anyone.    Don't be afraid to ask for help.    I'm slowly learning that folks really mean it when they offer it and I'm not here on an island by myself.
I can't stress enough making sure you find time to interact with people as well.  I work from home so my direct interaction is limited so I try to find time to meet with the kids, walk the dog with a friend or just get out.    The one thing that gets me every once in a while is the profound silence in the house.    Until you have silence you don't know how much interaction, movement and engagement you have everyday with those around you.    We've been lucky that we can text or talk every day - Verizon has been great service so far.   I honestly don't mind the peace and quiet but it's only been a week.   At some point the solitude might just drive me batshit crazy.
I've done all the things on the lists I've mentioned we had in a previous post and keep Zin updated so hopefully it eases his mind that I'll be ok and he can focus on the journey.  
As he mentioned, I got my AT guide yesterday so I'll be following his journey as well which is something I'd recommend to those who are supporting a thru hiker.   I will know where he is or should be should something happen and we can talk about and discuss what that stretch of trail was like, who he encountered (human or critters) so that I can be part of the adventure at least in spirit.   

Thank you to everyone for your posts so far.  We both read them.   Your encouragement and wisdom will keep us both going until we take the last picture on top of Katadin together - finishing what we started together.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582965,"I spent the afternoon yesterday reconfiguring the way I pack up. Pretzel gave me a ride from Mountain Crossings to Blood Mountain Cabins because most of my gear was spread all over his back seat. When we got there he told me that, “he could tell that I’m that guy who has a bag within a bag within a bag.”  I’ve been using sea-to-summit dry bags to group like things within my pack. I’ve suspected that I have extra room I wasn’t utilizing because of air left in the bags. Not wanting to be that guy I went on a mission to empty as many bags as possible. I ended up splitting my clothes into two bags, leaving the bags open so I could compress more air out of them. I’m keeping them in bags for the moisture barrier because I know when I get down to wearing just a shirt when it’s warm (which may be tomorrow) I will sweat through my backpack and soak my clothes if the bags aren’t there. 
I’ve been putting my inflatable sleeping pad, inflatable pillow, and silk sleeping bag liner in a dry bag and carrying them in an external pouch. Only the liner needs to be kept dry, so I put it with my clothes. The external pouch now has room for my stove, cook pot, and gas all of which are no longer in a bag inside my pack. Next I looked at my food bag and decided that there was nothing in it that I couldn’t submerge, so I put all the individually packaged food on top of, and around my clothes bags where there were voids of space.  When I get to camp, I remove the food and put it in a bag so it’s ready for overnight critter proof storage. My spikes, AWOL guide and empty bags went in next. That left plenty of room for my tent, which I had been carrying on the outside of my pack in a compression dry bag. Now the only thing left hanging loose on the outside is my water filtration equipment, which is lightweight and I want back there for easy access. Huge improvement! The pack carries much better now. I still have a pack cover to at least offer token resistance against rain. Its kept everything dry the last two days through dripping trees and light rain. I’m not expecting everything to be bone dry when I eventually hit a serious downpour. 
I’m settling in now at Low Gap Shelter. I’m currently the only one here, but I’m expecting other hikers to arrive soon. A quarter to a half inch of rain is forecast overnight. It was warmer today and tomorrow is forecast to be near 60. I’m planning on hiking in shorts tomorrow for the first time on this trip. If it’s not raining when I leave the shelter, I will probably skip the rain jacket also. It’s fairly heavy weight and I intended to use it when it’s colder. There’s a point where having it on makes me wetter because it holds in so much heat. 
The new boots are still working well but are still in the break in period so I will be keeping the miles down for a while. The wider boots, strategically applied KT tape, and foot glide are keeping new blisters from cropping up for now. Tomorrow will be a big test, because I will be going 7.4 miles with a full pack. If I can, I will probably pull over and change into dry socks in the middle of the day.Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Hogpen Gap

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582992,"I was joined at the shelter last night by three other NOBO’s: Mainer, Ghost, and Big Load. Pop quiz: Based on these trail names, who do you think is struggling physically right now?  If you guessed C) Big Load, you are correct. Big Load is a 23 year old former college rugby player who is quite possibly carrying well north of 50 pounds on his back. He is fighting debilitating blisters (sound familiar?) But unlike yours truly, Big Load’s blisters appear to be less from the wrong footwear, and more from the physical pounding they are taking from transporting a big guy carrying a really heavy backpack. All three of these guys were hysterical and it was nice to finally spend some time with other hikers. 
Today’s hike started out very tame with a steady mostly uphill climb gaining 1,600 feet of elevation over the first 5 miles on what appeared to be an old logging road. Then things got ugly. One internet source I saw ranked North Georgia the fifth hardest section on the AT. This must be where the fun begins. The trail turned rocky as it approached Blue Mountain. I’m sure it wasn’t Pennsylvania rocky, but pretty rocky nonetheless. My pace, which had been about 2.4 miles per hour for the first several miles, slowed to a crawl. I repeatedly contended with stretches where the trail consisted of only boulders some of which moved under my feet.  At 11:00 I met a SOBO and her dog who began at Katahdin on October 1st. She told me they were finishing tomorrow. This meant that she was hiking 46 miles in a day and a half. After hiking over 2,100 miles, she made the comment that Georgia was hard and that the multiple steep ups and downs will wear you out. In light of that I don’t feel so bad being worn out as I start this section. 
My plan for the day was to stay at Blue Mountain Shelter. Big Load and Ghost arrived about the same time I did. There were also two day hikers from Georgia, Jay and Leprechaun, at the shelter when I got there.  I immediately removed my boots and put on my sandals. I took my phone out of airplane mode and received a text from Peaches. I wanted to be able to call her later, but service wasn’t great here. Big Load was staying at the shelter and Ghost decided to keep on hiking. I approached the day hikers to ask if they could give me a ride to Hiawassee and they said sure. So after about 15-20 minutes of sandals, I put the boots back on. Luckily I hadn’t removed my KT tape yet. The eye opener for me was that my feet that had been starting to get sore over the last couple of miles now felt really good. So I continued on into the gap 800 feet below on a steep toe crushing 2.5 miles of trail. 
I’m now at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee Georgia. I had planned to come here tomorrow morning and stay tomorrow night. Because I got here ahead of schedule and hiked my longest day so far and in boots that are still not broken in, I’ve decided to stay tomorrow night also to rest before taking on the remainder of north Georgia. I have no active blisters right now, just some soreness late in the day which I’m hoping will fade away as the boots are broken in or as I start doing more miles like today. This first section of my restart was critical. I was hoping to hold it together for 7.3 miles today, and I ended up going 9.7 without any problems. Today was the first time I started to feel confident that the bigger miles will come. I’m going to continue to keep my mileage conservative for a while, but I’m planning a 12+ sometime next week if everything continues to go well.

We’ll see how this goes Sunday.  I may still be fooling myself into thinking I’m organized.I will very likely run out of good luck with weather tomorrow morning.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583038,"Today was a short mileage day again, but I managed to put a couple of big climbs behind me. After being dropped off at Unicoi Gap I started hiking a couple of minutes before 8:00, my earliest start yet. First up was the 1,000 foot climb of Rocky Mountain. A little too chilly for shorts today, so I had on my leggings. On top I had a long sleeve shirt and my rain jacket. The climb got me good and heated up but I was glad I had the rain jacket on after topping out and getting hit by the strong breeze the mountain had been blocking. I went from a little too hot on the way up to just right on the way down to Indian Grave Gap. From there it was back uphill not quite as steep but now a 1,400 foot climb of Tray Mountain. Then it was a quick jaunt to the shelter. I had more miles in me, but it was drizzling most of the morning with heavier rain forecast for the afternoon so I called it quits rather than try to push 8 more miles to the next shelter. 
I’m staying in my tent tonight rather than sleeping in the shelter. I will probably do this every time that it’s the better option. Staying at the shelter are Bullfrog, Lotus, Now, and Arnie. I met Arnie this morning while I was waiting for my shuttle to pick me up. She offered to share the ride with me, but it sounded like her ride might take a while and I was anxious to get started and try to beat as much of the rain as possible. I visited and ate dinner with the gang at the shelter then said goodnight as it was getting dark. This was good timing because it started sprinkling moments after I got back in my tent. They are all very nice people but I doubt I will see them much after tomorrow morning. It sounds like Arnie is slower than me and the three guys are much faster. 
Looking forward to a nice hike tomorrow. The forecast calls for sun. The remainder of the extended forecast shows cloudy or rain for the next 7 to 10 days.

When I got up pre-dawn for a privy visit and to get my food bag down, I was wearing my headlamp which was just lighting up droplets of the thick fog we had at that time, so I couldn’t see much of anything. By the time I had breakfast, changed clothes and packed up, the fog had receded and there was a beautiful sunrise with a cloudless sky above. It was sunny all day long. 
When I was ready to leave at 7:30, Lotus and Bullfrog were also ready and they fell in right behind me. Now had left at 7:00. Arnie was still in the shelter with her gear not packed when I left. I let Lotus and Bullfrog pass me as soon as we were back on the AT, conceding that they were certainly faster than me. I pulled over soon after to let my fingers warm up because they had gotten pretty frozen during the final stage of packing up. Lotus and Bullfrog disappearing down the trail would be the last humans I saw the rest of the day until I got to my destination. I’m staying tonight at the Top of Georgia hiking center. I arrived a few minutes before 4:00 and saw Now. He said that the shuttle to town was about to leave. I needed to clean up and I had just spent Thursday afternoon and Friday in Hiawassee, so I passed on the town trip. As a result I’ve had the place to myself since the shuttle left. I’ve showered and called Peaches. Now I’m baking a frozen pizza. By the time I’m done with the pizza my laundry should be finished. 
Great weather today so I made several rest stops where I could get my boots off. I changed into dry socks in the middle of the day and applied more KT tape to a couple of spots that were getting warm. I’m approaching 40 miles since restarting with no return of my earlier blistering problem. Today was my longest day hiked so far and my first double digit day. 
Oh, and I forgot to report yesterday that I had my first fall. It wasn’t an official AT fall because it happened at camp on the side trail to the water source. I had set my tent up and changed into my sandals. The steep, muddy trail was no match for the sandals and I fell down. No big deal since I fell on my backside which has plenty of cushion these days. The worst part about it was that there was a witness because Now was gathering water when I went sliding into 2nd.The Top of Georgia staff just put out a revised forecast for Monday and Tuesday that shows chance of precipitation down to 20% from the previous 40 to 50%, so this is great news!Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Tray Mountain Shelter

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583135,"Georgia apparently had enough sun yesterday because today was right back to gloomy. Pea soup gloomy. At one point I thought I should be taking a ring to Mt. Doom. I did manage to briefly sort of see the sun today. It happened as I topped out on the highest climb of the day. As soon as I got off the summit, that nonsense was over and it was back to Mordor. It was on the way down into the next gap that I had my excitement for the day. Against a backdrop of impenetrable fog, a large black animal partially shrouded in mist, crossed the trail 20 yards in front of me.  A BEAR!!  However, when Mr. Bear made his way up the hill I saw how he moved and heard the sound he made. Mr. Bear was not a bear at all. He was a wild boar. I would have preferred a bear. A wild boar running down the trail at you is the equivalent of being charged by a 300 pound bowling ball with tusks. Fortunately this one had no quarrel with me and went on his way up the hillside. I stood there for a couple of minutes clacking my trekking poles together and shouting, “No pig!!”  I then cautiously continued past the spot where I saw him. I never saw any sign of him again and 15 minutes later I was at camp. I got the last laugh when I had a Spam single on a tortilla for lunch. 
I did short miles today because I did bigger miles yesterday. In fact, my plan for tonight had been to stay at Top of Georgia. Since I made it there last night, I was able to move on today and cover a few miles. This is the last shelter in Georgia. Tomorrow I will cross into North Carolina. I’m staying here tonight with Maximus and Kett.  Maximus thru hiked in 2014 and is doing it again this year.  I actually shared the shuttle ride back to the trail with them this morning. This shelter sleeps 16, so with only 3 of us here, we set our tents up in the shelter to keep the mice at bay.  Probably a good idea since I can already here the little pukes scurrying around outside.Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Dick’s Creek Gap

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583136,"I got a nice early start this morning at a few minutes after 7:00. I wore my headlamp out of camp, but didn’t need it for long. Today I finally made it to North Carolina. I wasn’t planning on making a big deal out of crossing an arbitrary line, but after what I’ve been through to get this far, it was special. 
Shortly after making it to North Carolina I came to Bly Gap where there were 3 tents still set up at 9:30.  The three gentlemen in the tents would later end up at the same shelter I did. North Carolina probably puts welcome centers at its borders along major highways. I’m sure budget constraints prevent them from placing a welcome center on the AT. So instead, they put in Courthouse Bald, a relentlessly steep 900 foot monster. Welcome to North Carolina, NOBO’s!  After Courthouse Bald, only two more 400 foot climbs remained to get me to the shelter.  This was my highest AT mileage day yet and I’m wiped. 
About half an hour after I arrived Shoemaker came in. He is a hammock camper and we decided if no one else came I would set up my tent in the shelter and he would set up his hammock. Of course right after we finished setting up and taking all the shelter space, the three Bly Gap campers showed up. Their names are Dan, Jeremy and Buddy. We offered multiple times to take our gear down, but they said they would prefer to set up their tents outside. So this is the second night in a row I’ve tented under a roof

If possible during the day I stop, change into dry socks and make any necessary adjustments to my taping. I’ve noticed the new boots becoming more and more comfortable as time goes on and hope the break in period is about over. 
There was again pea soup fog all day so no views. The only picture I took was a selfie by the state line sign. The consensus among hikers out now is we need some sun to dry things out. Days of thick fog and mist has made everything damp including our gear, our clothes, and even the inside of shelters.  Can’t wait to get to town and dry out!Zin Master“The journey is the reward.”","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583148,"Today featured another helping of the AT’s go to dish: heavy fog with rain. The afternoon and evening forecast called for thunderstorms and as I write this heavy rains have begun on cue. The morning started with a weather delay as heavy rain was coming down. I was able to pick up enough signal to get a local hour by hour forecast which showed a milder weather window coming up so I waited until 8:15 to leave camp. I started the day by finishing the remaining 800 feet of Standing Indian Mountain. It was a gentle climb that went by quickly. From there the trail was relatively easy until a climb just before camp. There were several small stream crossings today that normally could just about be stepped over. Today they were a little treacherous. 
I got to the shelter at the same time as Shoemaker. He had left after me but caught up at the end. Dan, Jeremy, and Buddy came in half hour later, had lunch and continued on. Shoemaker and I are joined tonight by Lotus, whom I first met at Tray Mountain and PT. PT’s wife is picking him up Friday morning to go to Franklin, so Shoemaker and I may catch a ride with him. 
Tomorrow we all tackle Albert Mountain, a 1,000 foot climb with an extremely steep section at the end. There is a fire tower on Albert that offers great views—if its not incredibly foggy. It will be a long day as we are trying to make as many miles as we can so we can nero (near zero) on Friday on the way into town.Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Standing Indian Shelter

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583246,"Today began with, wait for it, thick fog!  I thought things were setting up for a repeat of the last several days of gloom. However, today the trail provided in a big way. The fog started lifting as I was getting ready to ascend Mt. Albert. On the way up I started seeing splashes of sunlight and blue sky. By the time I got to the top it was mostly cloudy but there were views of the surrounding mountains in all directions. Mt. Albert has a fire tower on it that is closed, but I was able to climb the stairs to just below the enclosed upper portion. When I got to the top of the mountain, PT, Lotus, Dan, Jeremy and Buddy were already there taking in the views. I had been on a couple of nice overlooks when I was on the trail in January when it was sunny, but for these guys it was the first time they had been able to see much of anything.
Mt. Albert is the symbolic 100 mile mark for NOBO’s. Three quarters of a mile later is the actual 100 mile mark. I was the last one off the top and when I got to mile 100 the rest of the guys were setting up to do a video shoot for Dan’s YouTube channel. So I got to be included in the video. It will be uploaded in about two weeks. I believe the channel is Intrepid Dan. 
The climb up Albert was strenuous, with the last quarter mile being very steep. I told myself it was like climbing a mini version of The Incline in Colorado Springs and just took my time picking my way up and over mostly jumbled rocks. At one point I hit a full on rock scramble and had to carry both trekking poles in my left hand and pull myself up with my right. Today was also long. This was my third double digit mileage day in the last five. My feet are still hanging in there, though they definitely wanted out of the boots by the time I got to the shelter. I did develop a lot of pain in my right shin today. I was worried that it might be shin splints, but when I got to camp I could see the spot that hurt was red so I must have done something specific to that spot. Tomorrow morning’s hike is a 3.8 mile nero, so I’m hoping it doesn’t bother me too much. I will need to evaluate this and make sure that I’m good to go before continuing because the next resupply is 28 miles ahead. The last few miles today were pretty miserable. I’m taking a zero in Franklin Saturday and I hope that’s all the rest I will need. 
I’m in the shelter tonight with Lotus. He will be moving on tomorrow and bypassing Franklin. PT is set up in his tent. He and I will hike together and his wife will pick us up at the next gap and take us to town. PT plans to continue on Saturday. Shoemaker went to Franklin tonight and likely will be continuing on tomorrow. I met Lotus last Saturday, Shoemaker on Tuesday, and PT yesterday but I’m going to miss these guys. The shared experience of the trail brings people together quickly. Because it seems like everyone out here right now is either faster or slower than I am, I’m grateful for having been able to spend a few days with these guys. 
Tonight I met Fresh Ground.  Fresh Ground is a Trail Angel and former thru hiker. He runs what he calls the Leap Frog Cafe. He sets up at a gap and makes breakfast for and gives sodas and fresh ground coffee to thru hikers as they pass thru. He then moves ahead on the trail and does it again, sometimes seeing the same hikers multiple times. He is hammocking in the gap just below us tonight and has promised to bring us coffee in the morning.  
As we settle into bed tonight the moon is lighting up the woods and there is no fog. Also no water dripping off trees onto the metal shelter roof all night. Life is good.Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Carter Gap Shelter

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583264,"As promised, Fresh Ground came to the shelter this morning and made coffee. I’m not a coffee drinker, but PT was very appreciative. Prior to Fresh Ground’s arrival, Lotus had gotten up early and left camp pre-dawn under headlamp. Fresh Ground had a wonderful idea over coffee: he offered to slackpack PT and I to Winding Stair Gap where PT’s wife would be picking us up. We didn’t need to think that offer over long. With Fresh Ground taking our packs, the climb out of Rock Gap was much easier. PT and I had a great conversation on our short hike. I’ve hiked 100+ miles alone, so it was nice to have someone to talk to for a change. When we arrived at Winding Stair Gap, Fresh Ground already had his stove going heating up hot dogs. He went on to heat up spaghetti and mac and cheese. PT’s wife was running late, so we settled in and visited more with Fresh Ground, and had second breakfast. Three young NOBO thru hikers came into the Gap while we were waiting: Hot Sauce, Zoom Zoom, and CPU. They were followed by the fourth member of their group, Squirrel. Fresh Ground made a grilled cheese sandwich for each of them. PT’s wife arrived and took us into Franklin, North Carolina. We each got rooms at the Microtel and PT and I went about the business of washing off the trail. I did what may become known as the Zin Sandwich. I took a full shower, then closed the tub drain and filled the bath to soak in and continue scrubbing the grime off my feet. When I’d had enough bath, I turned the shower back on to rinse off. Those who live everyday in civilization don’t know how good they have it. After getting cleaned up we headed to the laundromat. While our clothes were in the wash, we headed next door for barbecue. With clean clothes and full bellies, we headed to Walmart to resupply. We had dinner and drinks tonight at The Lazy Hiker Brewery. PT is hitting the trail tomorrow. I hope I run into him again. I can tell he is going to make it to Katahdin. I’m taking a planned zero tomorrow, which I hope doesn’t turn into more zeroes. My right shin is swollen and very sore. When I’ve been in my room today, I have been applying an ice compress to try to reduce the swelling. If it’s not starting to feel better tomorrow I will go to urgent care to see what’s going on. Nice to sleep in a bed, but I’m already missing the trail. Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Rock Gap Shelter

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583265,"Peaches here!  Just spent some time on the phone with Zin.    It’s nice to hear his voice even though we’ve been in touch everyday.    If Verizon is scanning the internet looking for mentions, I hope they find us and give us new phones for promoting them.
Moxie & I have our groove after 4 weeks without Zin around.    As most of you have noted, Zin’s dry sense of humor is in each of his posts.   I miss it in person but you get to enjoy it as much as I have for years.
I don’t have any epiphanies to share now that some time has passed.   That just tells me we did a pretty good job of preparing for this journey.    
 It has proved true that the best thing I can do for Zin is cheer him on and keep sharing his story so others can cheer him on too.    He did say that you can’t underestimate how important all of your posts are to keep him motivated to keep at it.   He knows people are following him to make him accountable but more importantly not let you down.
Thank you to all of Zin’s new trail friends.   I know he’s fine but it gives me piece of mind that he’s not alone.  You are just another reason this is his dream - with a new friend and new adventure each day to look forward to.   I hope to meet some of you when I join him on the trail on occasion.
Keep up the posts.   I love to read them as well.    Thanks to our friends and family who follow along and share the encouragement.     We miss our Saukville crew but love hearing from you.   Same goes to my work family.   
Keep Zin motivated... his shin is bothering him a bit so hope he can recover and push through.   
Happy and safe travel to all on the AT.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583292,"Today was a planned zero day. Unplanned was the trip to urgent care this morning. I have tendinitis in my lower right leg. They gave me a steroid shot at the clinic and a prescription for steroid pills. The nurse said the shot needed to be in my hip. I told her that was a nice way of saying ass. I’ve been taking the steroids as well as ibuprofen today. I spent the entire day outside of meals with my leg elevated and an ice bag on it. I’m going to stay in town at least one extra night and maybe two. The more this heals, the less chance I will aggravate it or re-injure it. I suspect I will have to manage this carefully for a while and make sure I always have an adequate supply of “vitamin I” handy. It’s strange  how the trail, its culture, and being outdoors can get its hooks into you. After the abuse of the last 40 miles, I was looking forward to the upcoming town break. But yesterday, before I had even spent one night in town yet, I was longing to get back on the trail. I’m hoping that’s a good sign that means I will continue to push forward and overcome whatever obstacles may be in my way. There are going to be epic obstacles ahead. They are all for future Zin to deal with. I can only take on the challenges where I am. Worrying about what’s ahead is pointless.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583342,"Ok, last day of town rest. This was a double zero. I figure I gave back the day I was ahead by leaving Dick’s Creek Gap early. Another day spent icing and popping pills. Tomorrow I will head out mid-morning and see how the leg holds up. To really be bomb proof would be to take another week off. Not happening. I’m not going to let good be the enemy of perfect. I will concentrate on leading with my left foot on steep ups and downs and I will slow my pace down a little, but I’m not stopping. I spent an hour after dinner tonight organizing my gear for packing up tomorrow. I also spent at least an hour binge watching music videos on YouTube with my earphones in. To say my taste in music is eclectic is an understatement. Songs on my phone span 80+ years of popular music. Tonight’s featured genre for the videos was girl singers from the 80’s and 90’s.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583383,"Back on the trail today. I took my time getting going this morning because I wasn’t planning on going far. I arranged for a shuttle to pick me up at 10:00 and take me back to Winding Stair Gap. The driver must have been on Lombardi time because he was five minutes early, which was fine with me. We got to the gap a few minutes after 10, and I was on my way. Most of the day the sky was overcast with thick fog banks above 5,000 feet which I think I went above twice. I was passed by a young couple near mid-day and a few minutes later I was passed by a young man. I caught up to all three of them near Siler Bald. I stopped there for my lunch and chatted with them for a few minutes until their break was over and they continued on. I didn’t take the side trail to the top of Siler because it was socked in with thick fog. Siler Bald Shelter was my first option for camping, but I still felt good and it was only 1:00. So I kept going. The next option was seven and change miles in. It was a campsite supposedly but I didn’t see any good spots to set up a tent and I still felt pretty good so I decided to make for Wayah Shelter. On the way, I summited Wayah Bald. I was glad I’m slow today because by the time I got to the top the fog had lifted and the clouds cleared away, revealing amazing views in all directions. I could see Albert and Standing Indian, both of which I climbed last week. It was amazing to see mountains in the distance and realize that I walked from there to here. 
Tonight I’m set up in my tent at the Wayah Shelter. There’s a pretty decent crowd here. Three in the shelter, one of whom is a SOBO who started last July, and four others in tents including the three who I talked with at lunch. I heard from PT tonight. He’s at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) tonight and will be leaving in the morning. I plan on being at the NOC Wednesday night, so I’m still two days behind him.Zin Master “The journey is the reward.”","Winding Stair Gap

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583430,"It was cold overnight with the temperature probably making it into the low 20’s. Snuggled into my sleeping bag, I ended up not being cold, but a little chilly. And of course I would rather lay there and be chilly for hours rather than take three minutes to get up and put on more clothes. I finally gave in around 4:30 and put on my camp socks, lined pants, and puffy jacket. The next couple hours were much better. Once the sun came up and the temperature started to rise, today was the best weather day I’ve had on the trail. I have passed several 5 to 20 foot long side trails over the last 100 miles. Every one has been fogged in with no view. Finally, I came upon one today and was able to take in an unobstructed, sun drenched view of hills and mountains receding into the distance. 
I was one of the first to leave camp this morning so during the first hour on the trail I was passed by all the 20 somethings who had stayed in and around the shelter with me last night. I was also passed by Patches. Patches hiked south from Katahdin late last year and made it to New York before stopping to take time off. She has now restarted by hiking north from Springer. I came upon her at Cold Spring Shelter making her lunch and I stopped to have a snack and talked with her there. 
As the day wore on, it became clear that my leg is not alright. Each step feels like I’m bumping my shin into something. It took me 5 hours to cover a little over 7 miles. I’m slow, but that’s ridiculous and I could tell I was getting progressively slower throughout the day. I called Peaches to let her know that I’m getting off trail. I was able to contact a shuttle driver who picked me up at Tellico Gap and took me to Enterprise car rental in Franklin. I’m now back in Kingsport Tennessee and will take some time to evaluate what my next move will be. Until I figure out my plan, I will be suspending updates of this journal. Thank you, everyone for the support you have given me on this journey, it has buoyed my spirits time and again.

Zin Master,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585032,"Today was the first day I’ve done any hiking since leaving the trail with tendinitis four weeks ago. I was able to slackpack with PT, and we both agreed it was the best day we have had on the AT. To catch you up a little, since leaving the trail, I returned to Colorado for a week then drove back to Tennessee with Peaches and our dog Moxie. We are likely going to be based here in Tennessee for the foreseeable future. When I arrived in Kingsport, I reached out to PT to see where he was. It so happens that he has been battling, wait for it...tendinitis. He had been hiking with Lotus for a few weeks, but when his ankle started bothering him he took several zeroes and Lotus continued on north. PT was staying at Greasy Creek Hostel, so last Tuesday I picked him up and took him to my in-laws where he enjoyed a home cooked Italian meal. Bad weather was settling in over the area last week with heavy snowfall predicted for the Roan Highlands, which was next up for PT on his way north. He decided to wait the storm out at the hostel. On Friday morning I went back to the hostel and picked up most of PT’s gear along with the gear of two other hikers so they could slackpack over Roan Mountain to Carvers Gap. When they got to Carvers Gap, PT’s companions decided to hike on while PT elected to be conservative and stop for the day. So I shuttled PT down from the gap to the city of Roan Mountain Tennessee. Our first stop was Bob’s Dairyland, a hiker friendly sandwich shop where you don’t get cheated on portion size. Dave, the owner of Doe River Hostel where PT was headed for the night, stopped by and told us that he owned a bar on the other side of town and that people in the community had been pre-paying for beers for thru-hikers. Guess where stop two was. After receiving our complimentary beers, getting our names on the board and having our pictures taken, we then needed to have one for PT’s wife. We didn’t have any choice - she asked us to do it. Then we needed to have one for Peaches. She didn’t ask us to do it, but we still had no choice. After we had gotten our drink on, I shuttled PT and PBS, whom I met on my 2nd to last day on the trail, to the hostel. On Saturday, Dave shuttled PT 14 miles north and he slackpacked back to 19E. PT then took a zero on Sunday. This was done to set PT up for a slackpack on Monday when the weather was clear across the remainder of the Roan Highlands. This portion of the trail crosses several “balds” which are mountains with no trees on top, so you get unobstructed 360 degree views. I decided to Join PT and stress test my leg. One challenge I faced was that I took my hiking clothes to Colorado and left them there. So I had cotton and cotton blend clothes to wear, a big no-no in the back country. It was 23 degrees with a howling wind at Carvers Gap when we started, putting the wind chill near or below zero. I of course wore shorts. That won’t surprise my Wisconsin friends. My legs never get cold when I hike, so it was no big deal. I had a long sleeve shirt and a fleece lined hoodie. PT loaned me mittens he wasn’t wearing and I ended up being toasty all day. It was cold enough that I didn’t sweat, so wearing the cotton clothing wasn’t a problem either. We passed over several balds over 5,000 feet in elevation that had amazing views. The trail conditions included frozen mud, incredibly wet and slippery mud, polished ice, rough ice, ice machine ice, (fallen off trees) water, rocks, roots, and some pretty nice trail too. Another day at the office on the AT. After making it back to 19E, we called Dave who picked us up five minutes later and drove us to his bar where I had parked my truck in the morning. We again did our three beers and then headed to Bob’s Dairyland for dinner with Hickory, a thru hiker we ran into when we passed the Stan Murray Shelter mid-morning. Hickory made it to 19E a couple minutes after we did. After dinner I ran the boys back to the hostel. PT is moving on tomorrow and will be in Virginia later this week. I’m still undecided on my Trail future. My leg didn’t give me any trouble today so I’m thinking of doing some more day hikes using Kingsport as my base and filling in more pieces of the trail. If I keep at that, I may do a legit restart sometime in the future. That’s not in the cards right now, and I’m completely fine with that. I still have until January 22nd of 2019 to complete the entire trail to make this a true thru hike.","Carvers Gap
