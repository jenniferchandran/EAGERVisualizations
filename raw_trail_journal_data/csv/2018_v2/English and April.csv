English and April,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584916,"Still preparing for our trip in April. Today, I needed laundry detergent and English made me walk to the Dollar General with a 25lb weight in a backpack. In his defense he did walk with me and I was able to convince him to carry the backpack with some added gain flings back home.","

English and April,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585128,"Well as the time is quickly approaching I find myself excited and very very nervous! We have all the flights and transportation arranged, hotels booked. We ordered the last of our gear and food today and are looking forward to be able to pack the bags for the finally shake outs.
We plan on going camping and hiking this weekend with the Black Bear chapter of the FTA here in Florida. It's hard to get the right amount of conditioning here in mostly flat Florida but we have taken to walking the multiple staircases here at my work, we call it Mount Showalter...lol. 
Our trail buddies are going to be meeting us in Gatlinburg on April 19th and on the trail first thing Friday the 20th. Angie and Breeze are going to be a welcome site as we have missed them since they moved back to Kentucky at the first of the year. 
We are hoping the weather improves in the next three weeks. Reading everyone's journal has made us a bit apprehensive. We do read the daily journals and look forward to making our own.","

English and April,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586384,One week to go before we are on the trail! So excited!! The weather looks to be improving somewhat but I did upgrade my sleeping bag to a Mountain Hardware Ratio 15 just to be safe. Base weights are in at 24.5 pounds. We may be able to shed a few more ounces once we do our last shake downs. We will be putting in at Deep Gap NC on the 20th and then 10 days to Clingmans Dome. Since we know we will have very limited cell service we are taking a Delorme InReach Explorer with us so the folks back home can see our progress and we can send texts letting them know we are OK.Well till next post.....happy trails.,"Still at home.
