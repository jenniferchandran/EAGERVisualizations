Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603105,Today was food prep day. We prepped and packaged most of our food as well as did a final gear check. This included Charlotte’s new tent. Just want to make sure we had a solid plan for organizing everything in our packs i.e. will it all fit? We watched a YouTube video of a bear trying to break into a bear canister.  Now have 100% confident our food should be fairly safe. This week is going to fly by. I can’t believe we’re leaving in five days to fly to Atlanta. Pretty sure we’re going to get drenched by the hurricane but still plan on having the time of our lives!,,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sun",0
Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603273,Tomorrow is my day off before leaving at the crack of dawn Friday morning.  There are last minute food additions to pick up and socks so treat with permethrin.  Everyone I talk to thinks we need to take the pepper spray so in the pack it goes.  Need to check and then double and triple check TSA's list of allowable items in carry-on and checked luggage.  Never would have guessed our lithium battery packs for the iPhones cannot be in a checked bag.  Much thanks to ATSurvivorDave for all his advice.  Looking forward to meeting him at the Atlanta MARTA station.  To bed I go.  36 hrs and counting!,"

Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603307,"In 12 hours Charlotte and I will be waiting for our flight to Atlanta, GA.  And at this time tomorrow night we will be setting up our camp at Max Epperson shelter at Amicalola Falls.  I can't believe it's finally here!  Started off my vacation with a mandatory meeting for work, Starbucks (cold brew, of course), Kroger, Walgreens, gas station and Salvation Army.  Scored not 1, but 2 pairs of close-toed Crocs for our camp shoes for $5.33.  I love, love, love Salvo.  Spent the afternoon triple-checking that I have everything I need to keep 2 people alive for 7 days haha.  I do.  However, not all the food fit in the BV500 bear canister.  Texted this to my hubby at work.  His advice:  take the bear out and try repacking!  I'm gonna miss him:)",,"Atlanta, GA","Sep 20, Thu",0
Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603406,Left Fort Wayne this morning 6 AM. Immediately after checking our baggage Charlotte remembered she left her lithium battery in her checked bag.  They had to get it off the bottom of the plane so we can take the battery out and then put it back.  Flight was uneventful.  Met our very energetic shuttle dude AT Survivor Dave at North Springs MARTA. He promises if we call him tomorrow morning for a rescue he would come get us.  Hopefully it won’t come to that. Although after today’s scenic hike  almost to the top of Amicalola Falls we might have to take him up on it. Enjoyed our first trail meal then immediately went to the gift shop and bought chocolate! The day has cooled off nicely.  We’re playing cards and calling it a day soon. (Definitely not going to watch Netflix on our phones in the shelter) Getting up with the sun tomorrow morning to attempt Amicalola falls for the second time but with 25 extra pounds on our backs.  Springer Mountain we’re coming for you!,"Atlanta, GA

Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603440,The phrase of the day is woefully unprepared! Started today by puking at the base of the falls. Just from a headache I guess. Took Charlotte and I two hours to do the 600 steps to the top from 8a to 10 AM. Stopped to rest and make coffee at the top. Hit the approach trail around 1030. Made the mistake of not cameling up at the first stream crossing and never saw water again.  We were forced to take the 1 mile side trail to the Len Foote Hike Inn. They were kind enough to let us use the facilities and fill our water bottles and even gave us a huge yummy cookie to share. He called it an Amicalicious cookie. After hiking back out that mile we went another .8 miles and found a great campsite along the trail. Had mac & cheese for supper played some cards and called it a day at about 7:30 PM. Springer Mountain is about 2 miles down the trail. Finally going to start the AT tomorrow!,"Max Epperson shelter
