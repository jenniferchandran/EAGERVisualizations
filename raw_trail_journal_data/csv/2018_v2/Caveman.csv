Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480135,"This weather in PA is crazy but still getting some hiking in. My pack weight is close to 45lbs to build up my strength and endurance and will then drop it as much as I can to start my thru hike. Days are not ticking down fast enough, ugh!",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Sun",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480179,It was brutal hiking this morning. Not because of it being 7 degrees out but the snow had a layer of crust on it and it made it difficult to hike. My one German Shepherd started bleeding from his pad so we turned around and just hiked an old dirt road that was plowed just so we could get some mileage in. Probably wont be any better tomorrow as tonight is down around zero. Hurry up spring!!!!,,View Entry,"Jan 13, Tue",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480289,"Been out trying to get some miles in this week. Averaging 12 miles a day on my hikes. Will start increasing some so I have my trail legs before I start the hike. Will be planning on getting a new pack and tent, hopefully this week, and start getting the weight down from the 45lbs now to about 30 which is still high for what i plan on starting the AT hike with.",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Sun",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480760,"Well I am now under 30 days until I start my journey down to Georgia to start my adventure. I reserved a room at the lodge at Amicalola Falls.Starting to get anxious Its time to pick up my training doing the toughest hills I can find to walk up and down, up and down, up and down, etc. Was leaning more towards taking a tent but leaning more into a hammock now with a tarp over it for rain/snow. The weather has kept me from doing my final shopping on a new back pack and hiking boots/shoes but hoping they have roads cleared today after I get threw with my training hike today so I can go get that stuff.Still lots of planning and preparations to do in the final month.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Fri",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481134,"Just over 3 weeks away and I'll be on my way to the start. Finally decided several days ago to go with a hammock instead of a tent. Trying to keep my pack at 30lbs or less with all my gear and food. I did lighten my load some with a new backpack. I have a Gregory Baltoro 75 but at 5lbs and 14oz just to heavy. Went to Appalachian Outdoors and had researched the Osprey Exos 58 but didn't like the fit. Finally went with another Gregory, this one a Z55. About 2 and 1/2 lbs lighter and it felt good walking around the store w 30lbs in it. Thanks to Arin who spent about 2 hrs with me as he helped me find everything I was looking for and giving recommendations. And to Dave who needs 1 more thru hike to gain the ""triple crown"". Gained some awesome advice from picking his brain with the numerous questions I had. Gonna be a nice day today, warm for what its been so I will be doing hills and hills and hills!",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Sat",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481743,"Well 2 weeks from today I will start my thru hike. This weather is unreal as it is right at zero degrees. Ugh! Still planning on getting out some today and get some miles in. Then maybe Saturday or Sunday get a long one in and some shorter ones in between. I have all my gear and without food and water my pack w everything is 21.5 lbs. Would still like to shave 2 lbs off of that weight though. Oh well, just need the days to tick down so I can start!",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Tue",0
Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482268,"I received my micro spikes in the mail couple days ago and tried them yesterday on an icy hill. Very impressed. A little heavier than my Yacktracks but better traction. Big storm is going to hit down south the next 2 days along with snow already down there. Pretty sure I'll need them. Then just received my new stove in today, its titanium and weigh a scant 1.2 oz plus titanium cross bar for it at .5 oz. Will use denatured alcohol as my fuel instead of compressed fuel.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Wed",0

Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483356,We'll I've done 115 miles now in 8 days of hiking. Some peaks were over 5000 ft and Albert Mtn I had to let my trekking poles dangle from my wrist as I used my hands to pull myself up the rocks. When I got to the top I was whipped. Also in my 2nd state now as I hit North Carolina at mile 78.5. Taking a zero day tomorrow to let my feet and body rest and heal. Making good time at this early in. 3/4 of all thru hikers traditionally don't make it out of Georgia so I guess I'm in top 25% now.,"

Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500578,I haven't posted in awhile but am in New Hampshire taking a zero day while the rains are making for a miserable day. Mt Moosilauke is what is next up and the steep granite mountain is not ideal to hike in the rain especially the going down side! Happy feet and I will stay safe to hike it another day like tomorrow and avoid injury today.,"

Will start back at Pink ham Notch. These White Mountains are no joke. Toughest part of this entire thru hike by far. My knees are screaming at the end of each day hiking these steep declines.,"

Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552983,"As I've changed my diet I'll also be changing my trail name. When I did my 2015 A.T. thru hike my trail name was Cookie monster"" due to my daily intake of cookies that goes back many years!But switching my diet to paleo/primal I will be going as ""Caveman"" due to the diet being from our hunter/gatherer ancestors. A primal diet allows meat, fish, seafood, poultry, eggs, veggies, fruit, seeds, nuts and healthy fats. And no grains, processed sugars, legumes (beans), and most dairy. Will have to rely on maildrops from my family and friends for my dehydrated/freeze dried veggies and fruits to keep my pack weight low.","

Caveman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554430,"I finished my first thru hike in 2015 and my trail name was Cookie monster. But I have changed it to Caveman for my 2018 thru hike due to attempting to change my diet on the trail as to what it is now. And that is a paleo/primal diet. It consists of meat, fish, seafood, poultry, eggs, veggies, fruit, seeds and nuts, good fats. And not suppose to eat grains, legumes, processed food.Instead of fueling my body with grains and sugars like i did in 2015, I'll be fueling with fats and protein. Continuing to eat this way for over 80% of my meals now and not getting sugar cravings or hunger as my body learns to utilize fat as its energy source instead of carbs.","
