Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584883,"I  have met a lot of interesting people from all walks of life. There is an 83 year old man named dave who is carrying enough gear for three people but keeps chugging along. There are couples some look like hikers some met on a trail and some got married and decided this is what they were going to do. A lot of solo girls wich kind of surprised me. I have even met a family of 5 mom and dad,boy at 9 ,two girls 12 and 15.The majority groups are about the 35to 45 range. Then the recently retired 55+ .Then the graduated from college and haven't found a job yet","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584889,I would like to tell you about all the trail names of all the people i have met but it would take forever. So I thought I will tell you the one that have stories behind them 1700 who was formerly known as 39er because she turned 39 out here but was changed after the cops showed up guns drawn at her hotel room for a minuscule amount of weed and issued her a ticket for 1700$. Then there is Tortilla who decided that carrying tortilla shells was too heavy so he decided to throw them in the privy and poop directly into it forming a perfect poop taco. There is more to come I will try to make an entry every day now cell coverage is supposed to be better in North Carolina,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585208,I have been putting in about 11-15 miles a day for the last 3 days crossed the 100 mile mark and kept on walking.I am feeling really good sore in the morning but no blisters. If I broke camp at the break of dawn like most people I could probably do 20 miles a daybut anyone who knows me knows that the crack of noon is more my speed,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585210,"So the first 2 miles of North Carolina were probably the hardest so far 2 mountains climbing to 5000 feet . For a flat lander like me thats a pretty good climb. Then there is the mountain they call Albert straight rock climbing! I renamed it fat Albert because when I got to the top I was so tired I felt like I hjust had one of those Cosby cocktails. Speaking of mountain names nothing will turn you into a 4th grader faster than the names on the trail in Georgia. Here are some examples younglick knob ,Little bald knobImean come on then there is Dicks gap not that funny right? Now at this point I have passed 20 gaps none of them were funny named at all so why does Dicks gap have to come at mile number 69","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585218,"One of the biggest surprises for me is the overall comradery we all have the same goal but everyone seems more than willing to help everyone else reach their goals weather it is gear suggestions or just positive attitudes or comments there is a genuine sadness when someone drops out.I had an experience with it yesterday but let me explain some trail terminology first.  The blazes a blaze is a painted stripe on a tree or rock white paint tells you you are on the Appalachian trail blue paint or a blue blaze tells you there is something off the trail like water ,a nice view or a shelter. The unofficial blazes  are yellow blazes wich means you walk part of the trail on the road. If you do this you are not a real thru hiker. Then there is pink blazing which means you try to spend your time with a girl on the trail. Pink blazing by some is sleeping together but in my mind maybe that works in Europe because there is something a little less attractive about a girl who works out for 8 hours a day doesn't take a shower or shave and won't carry deodorant because its to heavy. All girls out here have become motherly though the girls I have met check to make sure i have taken my medicine yesterday as I huffed and puffed my way up a mountain a 19 year-old brittish girl who I can't remember her trail name kept making me take a break drink water all the way to the top.","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586539,so my wifi points are far and few between. I wanted to put my daily thoughts and daily miles but it doesn't seem possible so I am going to just give highlights every 10 days or so. Made it 200 miles so far less than 2000 miles to go. Climbed the highest mountain here today 6600 feet clingmans dome in the smokie mountains. For anyone who likes to sightsee or camp or hike. This place is great there is an observation tower at the top and GatlinburgTennessee is only 15 miles away and Gatlinburg is a fun town.free moonshine tasting helps it be fun. Come in the summer though it was 38 degrees at 1p at the mountain top and 65 in Gatlinburg.,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586540,I am going to hike out of the smokie mountains in the next three days then on to hot springs north Carolina. That will be where I spend my birthday in a hot mineral bath. A little more trail lingo. A nero is a day when you hike a short distance and a zero is when you dont hike at all. So I will probably be taking a couple zeroes there soaking in the hot springs.I will post again when I can,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587291,Happy birthday to me. I got a 12 inch snow storm the night of my birthday . They closed all the roads in the area for 24 hours and I hiked 18 miles in it so cold set my hammock up inside  the shelter. Next 2 days were 50s and beautiful hiked hard to get out of the smokie mountains. There is a festival in hot springs this weekend gonna take a couple days off. Soak in a hot mineral spring is going to feel great! Then I'm off going to try to do 20 miles a day for a while at least get into the Shenandoah mountains. My body feels great for a newly 45 year old man hiking for 8 to 9 hours a day. Who would have thought a guy like me who 2 months ago got winded walking down the driveway to get the mail would say they felt great after walking up and down mountains for almost 300 miles?,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588076,I spent 5 days in a work for stay hostel to celebrate my birthday along with a couple others in my group fun but had to hike away from them they are just not moving fast enough for me. I am hiking about 16 to 20 miles a day and am not intending on taking any more zeros until somewhere in Virginia. Next stop in 68 miles Irwin Tennessee famous for 1 thing. They had a circus come to town in the early 1900s a elephant got out of line during the parade and trampled a child. The town convicted it of murder and then hung it in the town square crazy. Hiking will be so much better if it ever stops raining. I am still having fun lost probably 25 pounds from close to 200 down to 175. I fell for the first time yesterday but its so muddy didn't get hurt actually had a good laugh about it because I was bragging about how I had not fallen yet.I will post again in about 4 or 5 days.,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589283,"On our recent trip to hot springs we started a game. The object of the game is to have the least amount of people on your team at the end of the game. Here is how it works you pick any person you see it can be anyone policemen, biker dudes, toddlers, ect. You then declare that person you picked is on your friend's team. He or she can only remove said person from their team by going up to that person and without explanation and rather aggressively telling that person"" you suck and you are no longer on my team"". When it's your turn it can happen at anytime with anyone.                                                           I am still feeling great legs are holding up. Just about to the 400 mile mark and moving pretty quickly. Trying to get a little past Damascus V.A before the 18th of May. Damascus holds Trail Daze a festival. kind of the Sturgis of hiking. About 10 to 15 thousand people show up every year. If anyone lives close and wants to come out for a weekend of partying let me know.","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591333,"Just got through the weekend at trail days. What a great time now back to business. 100 miles a week is the goal. 17 weeks to the finish line. I am in Virginia about mile 500. Georgia, Tennessee,and North Carolina are in the rear view mirror but Virginia is over 500 miles long. The last week of hiking has been the most beautiful of the trail so far rivers, waterfalls,everything is finally green. I will be posting some pics. Next stop is the Grayson highlands where the wild ponies are. Had someone we know get kicked by one so be cautious. I was with a group of young partiers (the gatrats)and had a great time with them. They call it your tramily. I am hiking a lot faster then them now. So I have found a new trail family the( over 40 club and Stones) there is 5 of us. 4 over 40 and 22 year old guy who goes by the name Stones but he is more mature then the other 4 of us combined.","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595784,"So spent a little to much time partying in th e beginning now we have forced ourselves into staying on th e trail a lot more. We have been consistently been on trail for 17 days with only stops in towns to get food. We have made some miles though almost 500 hundred since my last post. We got rained on a lot. Now it's hot 104 degrees today plus th e terrain is still pretty bad. Then roots and rocks have gotten easier but whoever said Virginia was flat was badly mistaken. The plan today is 33 miles not sure if we can but it Will be our longest day so far. There is a brewery called th e devils backbone they let you camp on thier front lawn for free as long as you buy a beer. That is where we are heading. Not a lot has happened since last post mostly just hiking in the rain which has negatively impacted all electronic devices. I had to have my phone wiped everything was lost all contacts all pictures everything! Now it is hard to charge. We are about to embark on some trail challenges. Then first is th e suitcase challenge. For those who don't know a suitcase of beer is a 24 pack th e challenge is to carry them on a 24mile day drinking one beer after every mile since we are averaging just about 3 miles an hour this could get interesting.I will keep you posted on how it goes. Then other challenge is called th e 4 state challenge th e object is to hike in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania all in th e same day it's a 47 mile section which will take us pretty much 24 hours. Adding to this challenge is the fact that I have caught a fish in every state so far so I  will have to stop and fish in Maryland and West Virginia. I am still really enjoying the hike and we are on pace to finish the end of September however the Virginia blues have hit kind of boring hiking 2 or three days in between views otherwise same trees same rocks.I am still in it mentally but can't wait to get a little farther north. Pushing on","

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595788,one more thing the last 2 weeks have been the quitting point for almost everyone I know out here. The heat killed the dream of big miles in Virginia.I am unwavering in my commitment to finish. Lastly a ranger told me that some where around 6000 people started this trail and based on the amount that have already quit only expect somewhere around 800 to finish,"

Mid life crisis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598192,"six days non stop rain.feet are so waterlogged haven't had the heart to look and see how beat up they are. At least it's warm out. Passed some major milestones this week .Officially half way. Tried my best at the half gallon challenge weather was definitely a factor. 1100 miles knocked out ,Virginia Maryland ,and West Virginia all gone half way done with Pennsylvania still on pace for the end Oct 1st. Moving pretty quickly now as the rain has killed all the fishing spots and any view we might stop at. I have officially caught a fish in every state so far but if the rain keeps up Pennsylvania isn't going to be easy. Most of the people I had met through out my journey have dropped out. Pretty much just me and a friend stones who I have been hiking with for about 900 miles. He got the name because he got kidney stones out here and kept on going. Everyone else has been a casualty of the weather first it was cold and wet then 105 heat indexes now non stop soaking rain with knee deep water crossings.I am still going and every day is still the best day ever.","
