Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582777,"In 2011 I was able to fulfill one of my lifelong dreams of completing a thru-hike of the AT. I was able to accomplish the hike in no small part thanks to my wife. She was at home supporting me, caring for our youngest son who was still at home, and generally keeping the home front running.  When I finished, the more we talked about the hike and what a life changing adventure it was, the more she thought she would like to attempt one when the time was right.
Fast forward seven years, we are both retired, our two sons aren't living at home, and the time is right.  Well let's just say it's about as right as it will ever be.  We thought we would hike two years ago but that was squashed when we bought a piece of land and undertook the task of building a new house.  That project has taken us over two years and we still aren't totally finished.  We are settled in enough though, so this is going to be the year.  Our plane tickets are purchased, we registered with the ATC, we have a shuttle lined up to take us to Amicalola Park, and we should be on our way on the 6th of March.  We will start our hike on the 7th from the falls
Our gear is mostly set, but I'm sure we will continue to tweak some small things right up until we leave.  The hard part has been getting out to do a lot of training as the weather has been kind of nasty of late and we have been trying to get the house all buttoned up.  Of course, as our departure date nears every little ache and pain is magnified.  My wife has hip and back pain that she is constantly stretching.  I'm dealing with hamstring pain and a pain on the outside of my foot.  The hamstring pain is mostly brought on by my running, and I've dealt with it since before my last thru-hike seven years ago.  It didn't bother me once I got started hiking so I'm hoping all the little ailments will get better once we get going and get the kinks out.  My wife reminds me that when we first started discussing this adventure, I promised we would take our time and start out slow with no big miles.  Well the other day I started mentioning where we would be on our first couple of days, when I was reminded again that I was being too ambitious.  She is right of course. I tend to be to very competitive. But, I'm seven years older and dealt with knee pain and shin splints on my first hike because I pushed it too much early on.  Hopefully she will rein me in, and if not, I'm sure I'll be reminded in the guestbook if she starts complaining about the mileage in our journal
Much like my last hike we plan to make a journal entry everyday as we hike.  Keeping a journal about who I was with, what I saw, and how I felt, was one of the best things I did on my last hike.  My brother took my journal and made it into a hard-covered book which I often refer to to remind myself where I was, or who I was with at certain times. Truth be told, many times I pick it up and start reading, and the memories come flooding back and I relive the hike all over again. My wife also made a hard-covered book of many of the photos I took on the trail
I guess it is time to go.  We'll add a few more entries before we head out, maybe cover some of our gear, or our hike of the foothills trail this past spring.  I'll get my wife Mary to make some entries as she is a much better writer.
Feel free to sign the guestbook or look over my journal from 2011.
Thanks for reading

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583506,"Well I was planning on having a few more entries done before we left but we seem to be out straight trying to get everything finalized.  It was much easier before when someone was back home to keep everything going without a hitch.  This time my wife and I will both be on the trail and we are struggling with the logistics of closing up the house, getting all the bills on automatic pay, getting our mail taken care of (thanks Franz and Joanne), and all the other endless details that we deal with on a daily basis.  I think we will both be glad when we are on the trail and life slows down.  
We haven't got much training in lately, so we have pretty much resigned ourselves to getting into shape on the trail.  We have packed and repacked or bags several times and I still have difficulties getting all my stuff to fit. Once good weather arrives, I'll lose a lot of bulk from my pack but at the start I'll be packed to the gills.  Weight wise I think we are doing alright.  My wife's pack with all her stuff and one and a half liters of water weighs 20 to 22 pounds.  I'm running about 27 pounds with water but no food yet. We packed our first food bag for about 4 1/2 days and it came in about 9 pounds.  I'm not sure how we'll divide it up, but it takes up a lot of room. 
Hard to believe but in 4 days we will be leaving for the trail.  We have checked out a few videos and journals of hikers already on the trail and that only gets us more excited.  Looks like some are running into typical nasty spring weather.  Hopefully when we arrive that will all change, and we will only have sunny pleasant weather.  (yeah right!)
See you soon from the trail.

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583532,"I thought I would get our third entry done so the journal
will be up and running. We tied up a few more loose ends today, so that puts us
a few steps closer to being ready. Good thing too, only 3 more days before we
head to Georgia.
I figured I should cover some of the gear we will be
bringing. I won’t do a super detailed list, just most of the big items. First, a
disclaimer. I am not an ultralight backpacker, I’m not sure I could consider
myself a lightweight backpacker. I just know I like to be warm and somewhat
comfortable, so I bring what I have found works for me.
Tent – I used an MSR Hubba on my 2011thru hike and loved it,
but we need a tent for the two of us this time. We tried a Big Agnes Copper
Spur 2 and liked it, but ultimately settled on a Big Agnes Copper Spur 3. It
gives us a little more wiggle room and allows us to bring our gear inside
without too much of a weight penalty.
Sleeping Bags – I used a Marmot Helium bag the first time
and it worked well. I’ll be using the same bag again, and Mary purchased one as
well. I think they are rated to 15° and are very warm. We will also be using
sea to summit cool max liners to keep some of the funk out of the bags. Liners
seem to work well at keeping the bags clean, and they are easy to throw in the
laundry with your clothes when you are in town.
Sleeping Pad – Love my neo-air! It’s still in good shape so
it is what I’ll be sleeping on. Mine is the old rectangular shaped on that
crinkles quite a bit, and Mary has the more mummy shaped one. Bonus, this time
I made a pad inflator out of the contractor bag I use for my pack liner. It was
simple to do using the cut off neck of a soda bottle and a gasket from a garden
hose. It works well and should save some huffing and puffing when we get to
camp after a long day.
Backpacks – My Osprey Atmos 65 is quite worn and the straps
are stretched out. So, I’ll be using a relatively new ULA Circuit. I love the
large front stretch pocket along with the big hip belt pockets and side
pockets. I miss my brain though, so I’ve adapted a SMD brain for the circuit. When
it warms up and my cold weather gear goes home I may send it home as well, but
I’m not sure yet. Mary tried a Deuter 65-liter pack that seemed comfortable,
but it was too much pack for her needs. She now is using the Osprey Exos 58.
The pack seems very nice, but I wish they had kept the front zippered slash
pockets. It probably wouldn’t work for me, as I would overload it.
Cook set – MSR Pocket Rocket works well for us. We will also
be using a GSI Dualist cook set minus a couple of the bowls/cups. I think one
bowl each is fine.
Filter – Regular Sawyer Squeeze with various bags and Smartwater
bottles. Neither of us use a hydration bladder.  I tried a bladder, but it always seemed the
bite valve was in the dirt or laying on a gross shelter floor.
Shoes – I’ll be starting with some North Face Ultra 109’s
before switching to Vasque Constant Velocities. I’ve never used the North Face,
but they seem comfortable and I wanted something waterproof and with a little
stiffer sole at the start. Mary is using Merrell Mid Moab Ventilators and may
switch out to some sort of trail runners depending on how she feels. We both
have Crocs for around camp.
Clothing – I’ll be wearing running shorts, an outdoor
research shirt, and Darn Tough socks (the best). I also have a pair of
Smartwool long bottoms, some EMS zip-off pants, and EMS Power Stretch top. (My
favorite, and the same one I wore on my thru hike 7 years ago). An EMS puffy,
wool beanie, glove liners, waterproof mittens, buff, and face mask. That is
pretty much the extent of my clothing. Mary has a Mountain Hardwear skirt, her
favorite hiking shirt (which she has had so long we don’t even know what brand
it is anymore), along with Darn Tough socks. She also has Smartwool long top
and bottoms along with an EMS Power Stretch top. Wool hat, buff, glove liners,
waterproof mittens, puffy coat, along with shorts and shirt for sleeping. 
Rain Gear – We both will be carrying Marmot Minimalist rain
coats along with rain pants. I think mine are Marmot Precips and Mary’s are LL
Bean Gore Tex. Both are pants we’ve had for several years. I also have a Marmot
Mica jacket that is quite light and packable, but I remember on my previous
hike I wanted a more substantial rain jacket early on when the weather was cold
and rainy. The Minimalist seems to fit that bill. I may switch out to the
Mica later in the hike.
Misc. – We also have a basic homemade first aid kit (Band-Aids,
tape, meds), Neo Air repair kit, Leatherman micro knife, long handled spoons,
tea mugs, Flip phones (yes, you read that correctly), camera, clip Mp3 players
and various chargers. We will also carry a Tyvek ground cloth, butt pads
(chunks of an old Z-lite), and sections of Awol’s guide.
That is probably more than most of you wanted to know, but
it gives you an idea of what we will be carrying. If anyone has specific
questions, feel free to ask and we will try to answer. Our next entry will be
from the trail, or at least when we are on our way. Pre-trail excitement is
making it hard to finish all the last-minute details.

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583707,"The last two days at home are a blur. We installed 3 garage doors with the help of our good friend Gary, finishing around 6:00 pm before we headed off to spend the night with family.  Our niece Nicole gave us a ride to the airport (we had to get up at 3:00 am to make our 5:30 am flight - who books a flight that early in the morning?!). With Nicole's more than competent driving skills we made it to the airport on time.
After two flights, a MARTA ride, and a taxi ride we are in a hotel outside Atlanta. Tomorrow morning at 7:00 am our shuttle driver, Survivor Dave, will pick us up and take us to Amicalola Falls to start our hike. Final descent into Atlanta was a little ""bumpy"", but the good news is we flew through the rain front that was hitting Georgia, and now we can look forward to some clear but cool weather for the next few days.
Stuffed everything into our packs, and they are way too heavy! We will have an official weight tomorrow when we register at the visitor's center.
Looks like the weather here will be much nicer than it will be at home. We will miss the blizzard which could bring a foot to a foot and a half of snow to New England.
Somewhat apprehensive, but excited to be starting the trail tomorrow.

11.6 total miles today, but only 2.8 on the AT.
Survivor Dave picked us up promptly at 7:00 am and we headed for Amicalola. Of course, as we neared the park, we started seeing snow flurries. When we arrived at the park it was cold, no shorts or skirts today! We registered and got our numbers 723 & 724 for the year. Weighed our packs at 27 for Mary and about 37 pounds for me. More than we wanted, but we'll lighten up as we get more dialed in. Quick picture at the arch and we were off. 
After 45 minutes or so we had made the 600+ steps and we were at the top of the falls. Mary said she didn't think the stairs were as bad as she feared. The day was sunny, but it stayed cool and breezy all day. Never really took many layers off, actually had to add a couple as the day went on. Stopped for lunch on the way to Springer and met Rambling Man and Papa Dale. They were sitting beside the trail in a nice spot, so we joined them. We made the top of Springer about 1:00/1:30, signed the log, touched the first white blaze and took a picture or two. Being as early as it was, we figured we would make it down to Springer shelter, stretch and see how we felt. As we were about to leave, we encountered a woman with a Thru-hiking tag kind of milling around the top. As we started to talk to her, she started telling us that she had taken 3 days to do the approach trail and that maybe this wasn't for her. She was going to call her shuttle driver and head home. We continued on down to Springer shelter where we found it mostly empty, and all the tent sites vacant. 
We stretched for a while and felt so good we decided to make the extra 2.8 miles to Stover Creek Shelter.  Probably moving on from Springer was a mistake as we both were sore and tired by the time we arrived, and the area was quite full. But we secured a tent spot, ate and climbed into our bags as it was getting very cold and windy. Not much socializing tonight as it was too cold. Sleeping with the water filter tonight so it doesn't freeze.","Amicalola State Park

It was a long, cold night in our sleeping bags for about 11 hours. Mary never did get completely warm so I heated a water bottle up at about 5:30 to put in her bag; this helped a little. Our water bottles were slushy this morning, so with all our clothes on we got up, had some oatmeal and tea, broke camp and got moving. Once we got moving, we both felt pretty good. The outside of my right foot that bothered me yesterday felt better today. 
We made good time to Hawk Mountain Shelter where we had lunch with Michelle, Tyler ""Bum Knee"", Bo-Bo, Nerp (Nurse who wears/likes purple), and Emily. We headed out to see how far we would make it, and 2 miles later we came down into Horse Gap where we found a hiker wrapped up in his tent saying he was sick and needed a ride, but his phone was dead. We offered to make a call, but he didn't know who he wanted to call. Our shuttle driver, Survivor Dave, had given us a contact list of shuttle drivers. We tried Survivor Dave, and Ron Brown. We didn't have good cell phone service and were only able to make quick contact with Ron and then the call was dropped. We did get a few text messages out to a shuttle with hopes that he could pick the hiker up. It was cold, so we needed to move on. 
It never did really warm up today and we hiked in our layers with our hats and gloves on most of the day. We only removed them on a couple of the long uphill climbs. We thought about stopping a littler earlier today, but the sites we saw were not near water, and we really didn't have enough water for drinking, dinner, and breakfast. We ended up pushing on to Justus Creek Campsite, where it was just us and another thru-hiker that just cowboy camped even though it was very cold. By the time we set up and ate it was time to crawl into the tent for what is sure to be another long, cold night. Hot water bottle for Mary tonight as she climbs in and I'll sleep with the water filter again so it doesn't freeze. 
Additional note: The thru-hiker staying with us is the same hiker we met at Horse Gap. He had also come upon the hiker wrapped in the tent. He said he charged the kids phone and gave him some food. The kid told this hiker that he had fallen and was not only sick but out of food. Hopefully he got a ride, all we know is he is from Kansas...","Stover Creek Shelter

Up when it was light, too cold to linger. Ate a cold breakfast and got moving with a plan to have tea at Gooch Shelter. Got to Gooch quickly and the place was still packed with everyone packing up. Saw Rambling Man and Papa Dale and met a hiker named FloBo for the first time. We had tea, chatted and got organized for the day as we had now warmed up. Headed out hoping to reach Lance Creek Tent sites, which will set us up for Neel Gap on Saturday. 
Supposed to be warmer today, so maybe we won't need gloves. Couple of good climbs over Ramrock Mt and Big Cedar Mt. It was still cool, but we were able to hike in less layers and we got to see some really nice views on Preacher Rock. On Preacher Rock we met two women, each day hiking with their dogs. The dogs were Dixie and Olivia (didn't get the names of the women). Anyway, one of the women told Mary she looked like she just stepped out of a Title Nine catalog. Mary got quite a kick out of the comment (she isn't wearing anything from Title Nine). We met lots of other hikers as we all plodded along, I still have trouble remembering all of their names. 
We got to Lance Creek pretty early today which was good because sites were limited and the later arrivals are having trouble finding level ground to set up on. We both are doing pretty well, but we were glad to see camp as our feet are sore and Mary managed to get a blister on her pinky toe. Should be a warmer night so we will be able to chat with more people. Tonight we have Rambling Man, Papa Dale, Steven, River Jack, Jedmorgensen, and many others at camp. Hoping for an earlier start tomorrow so we can make it to Neel Gap early to beat the forecasted rain and get a cabin for the night. It will be nice to have a hot shower and a warm bed.","Justus Creek Campsite

Up about 5:30 packing up. Much warmer, so we weren't shivering. We were hiking by 6:30, most hikers had the same idea as nearly everyone was up and packing as we left. Rain is forecasted for this afternoon into Sunday morning, so everyone is looking to score a dry place to spend the night. We made pretty good time up and over Blood Mountain, but the climb and steep downhill really beat Mary up. 
While we were on the top of Blood Mountain, I called Blood Mountain Cabins and got a cabin for the night so we can resupply, get cleaned up, and do laundry. Made it into Neel Gap just after noon, Mary limped in with a couple of blisters on her pinky toes and one big toe. One of the workers at Neel Gap, who is also a Federal Woodlands Firefighter, is hooking me up with some new pole straps free of charge. I neglected to replace them before I left, so when I inquired at Neel Gap, he said Black Diamond had left some there free and he said he would install them for me. He was having a little trouble remembering how to do it, so we left them and will pick them up in the morning. We ate a Bacon Lover's Pizza as we waited to head down to our cabin. 
Made our way down the road to the cabins where we got our laundry done, ate (pizza again, not much of a choice), and got cleaned up. The plan is to stay off our feet and wait as long as possible tomorrow to avoid some rain. It may rain until Monday though, so we shall see...","Lance Creek Tent Sites

Although the mileage says 6.7, we also did an extra 1.2 miles into Whitley Gap shelter.
Still a cool, dreary day, so we waited until about check out time (11:00 am) to make our way back up the path to Mountain Crossings. At Mountain Crossings I found ""Pretzel"" again, who quickly brought me over to show me how the wrist straps came off the poles and how to attach the new ones. He said he had to do a little internet research, but figured it out. So, a shout out to Pretzel for new wrist straps at no charge and congratulations on his new endeavor as a Wildland Firefighter. Pretzel also showed me his wallet which is made by Recycled Firefighter Co and is made out of recycled fire hose. 
Did our resupply and headed up the trail. Many other hikers stayed at the cabins as there is talk of rain for a couple of days. We might have stayed but the cost was too much. Most had several hikers in each cabin which cut the cost. Also, we learned the thru-hiker rate is only if you are standing at their front door, first come first serve. Reservations are significantly higher, but we really wanted a warm, comfortable place to stay for the night. Hind sight we should have made arrangements with some other hikers prior to our arrival. We heard from one group of hikers that they had sent ""The Specialist"" ahead as he was a fast hiker, and he reserved a cabin for their group at the thru-hiker rate. We saw Tyler (we called him Bum knee as he stayed at Hawk Mountain when we moved on due to his knee), he was one of the hikers staying with The Specialist.  
As we headed up out of Neel Gap the rain had stopped and we had to quickly strip off our rain gear and some layers as this was the warmest day we have had on the trail. Our plan was to not go too far as we were getting a late start. We considered staying at the first shelter as the next was too far. Unfortunately, the first shelter is 1.2 miles off the trail which means another 1.2 miles just to get back to the trail in the morning. Rambling Man soon passed by saying he was going to the 2nd shelter. We played leap frog with ""River Jack"" and ""Jedmorgensen"" most of the day as we made our way up the trail. 
Soon we came to the turn for the first shelter (Whitley Gap) and we reasoned it would be better to do the 1.2 miles and have a dry night and no wet tent to pick up rather than camp along the trail, so we made the turn. It's called Whitley Gap for a reason. You walk on what would be a beautiful ridge in good weather, then you descend into the gap. We got to the shelter only to find we had it all to ourselves. We set up and cooked our dinner. Soon the rain started, lightly at first, but the wind also increased. By the time we were in our bags the gap had become one big cloud with a mist blowing diagonally into the shelter getting our bags and faces quite damp. We readjusted, trying to get as much protection as we could. The rain and wind picked up, but we did manage to get some rest. Another night of being in our sleeping bags way too long, but with the cold there was no other choice.
On another note, when we arrived at Neel Gap and dropped our bags outside the store Mary sat down at the picnic table with a young hiker, so she thought. Anyway, she made the mistake of asking his name and where he was from and if he was a thru-hiker. He started speaking very fast, telling her where he was originally from and then rambling on and on about military school, Alaska, Hawaii, etc. He was talking so fast she could hardly understand most of what he said. He did say he was camping out while he was in grad school. He hopes to hike the trail someday. He was cooking some fish he must have caught, and offering it to others who were politely declining. Apparently other hikers had already asked him a simple question and had also tried to politely listen as he rambled on. Mary said she had to go find her husband and quickly got up from the table.","Neel Gap

Although our mileage for today shows 11.1, we also did the 1.2 back to the trail from Whitley Gap. 
When we finally braved the elements to get out of our bags it was pretty late. With the time change and it being overcast it doesn't get light any too early. We quickly packed up our damp bags and had some oatmeal and tea. Again, no lingering this morning as the temperature had dropped significantly over night and what started as mist was quickly changing to sleet. We headed back uphill to the trail, questioning our decision to hike in so far to the shelter. Even though we didn't have a wet tent to pick up, we didn't exactly stay dry and warm. 
When we made it back to the trail intersection we found ""Jedmorgensen"" and ""River Jack"" looking mighty forlorn with a wet, sleet filled camp they were breaking down. I'm still not sure what the better decision was, but either way the morning has been kind of harsh. As we hiked on to Low Gap shelter for lunch the temperature continued to drop and the wind was now howling in many areas. Snow/sleet was falling and covering the ground and trees with rime ice. The only thing that was not white was the brown trail. 
As we descended into Low Gap the wind died down and it was warmer so things were just wet and muddy. At Low Gap shelter we had lunch with ""Waltnuts"" ""Bo-Bo"" and the ""Colonel"" ""Bo-Bo"" decided to stay as he had come from Neel Gap this morning. Everyone else was moving on including Brandon and Mark who we met coming in as we were leaving. It was going to be a pretty big day for us as we already had done 1.2 miles just to get back on trail. Mary's legs were sore and her pinky toes are both still bothering her even with them taped. We stopped at one point to stretch, and Mark and Brandon came up the trail. They stopped and we chatted for a few minutes. They are from Lowell, MA. They first said Boston, but once they realized we were from NH they said ""Oh, then you know where Lowell is. They are hiking together and said they have been friends since high school. 
As we hiked on the weather cleared and we actually saw some blue sky! The wind never fully let up, blowing most of the ice off the trees, occasionally pelting you in the face. As we neared camp with about 2 1/2 miles to go Mary's legs began to fade. The final miles to the shelter are a rocky traverse with a good climb into camp. We made it with plenty of light and had a good tent site, but it was cold and the wind was howling. Hiking in zip-offs and rain pants, long sleeve top, another insulating long sleeve top, down puffy coat, rain coat, neck buff, hat and gloves and I'm still cold after I stop for more than a few minutes. Lots of hikers here tonight including Brandon, Mark, ""Bluegrass"", ""Waltnuts"", ""Flo-Bo"" (Phlebotomist who goes with the flow), ""Colonel"", Tyler, who we call ""Bum Knee"", ""Awakened Ghost"" (or ""AG on the AT for short), ""Mega Cache Pop Tarts"" (I think?), and Logan. There is a fire in the fire pit tonight, but again it was too cold to hang out too long. 
Once again we ate and retreated to our down sleeping bags. Once we were in the tent we decided that based on the weather report of even colder temperatures tomorrow night, and the condition of Mary's toes and legs, we should go to town and take a zero. Instead of waiting two more days to go into Hiawassee, we can hike into Unicoi Gap and catch a shuttle to the Budget Inn. With a plan hatched, we tried to get some sleep.
Forgot to mention that we experienced our first trail magic this morning at Hogpen Gap. ""Wokman"", a previous thru-hiker (2016?), had donuts, muffins, and cold drinks in the back of his truck. He would have had hot coffee as well, but his inverter wasn't working. We each had a glazed donut, and chatted with him and a few other hikers that had also stopped. It was too cold to stay too long, but ""Wokman"" did mention NH was his favorite state on the trail.","Whitley Gap

Woke up at what we thought was an early time, but it was really 6:45. Of course it was still dark so we packed in a hurry because we wanted to make the 9:00 shuttle into town. We figured if we left at 7:00 we would easily make it. Unfortunately we got a later start than we planned, so it was going to be close. We needed to finish the climb up Blue Mountain and then do the long down hill into Unicoi Gap, a total of 2.4 miles. 
The wind was howling and it was very cold, so we moved as fast as we could to stay warm. We ate our breakfast as we hiked (blueberry poptarts). Again we were hiking in nearly all of our clothing and our fingers were still cold. The downhill was slow, so we didn't think we would make the 9:00 and would have to wait for the 11:00. As luck would have it I was able to get a call to the Motel to confirm the shuttle was running, and he informed me the shuttle probably wouldn't be there until 9:15 or maybe even 9:20 depending on which gap he went to first. With this info I picked up a stick and started whipping Mary to get her to move faster. (Very funny Earl Grey, he knows I will be typing this. He certainly didn't whip me, but I was moving slow due to my blistered toes and sore legs!). Just kidding, I did encourage her to move as fast as she could as we still might make the early shuttle. We made it with about 5 minutes to spare, and soon were the only ones on the shuttle from both gaps heading into town. I think the cold and still dark skies have a lot do do with us being the only ones there. When we left the shelter no other hikers were stirring in camp. On the plus side, we did get to see an awesome sunrise. 
We are spending most of the day in town doing our normal chores. Showers, laundry, organizing and cleaning gear, and of course eating. We had a good meal at Daniel's Steakhouse, an all you can eat buffet. Later we had subs at the Subway that is right next to our motel. We are trying to rest our bodies up and will do the same tomorrow. We did catch the weather and see that our home state is getting their 3rd major Nor'easter with a possible 4th on the way, and that is just in the month of March. At least I haven't had to plow and shovel all the snow, but I wasn't expecting such cold weather this close to spring in the south. I'm sure it will change soon, and I'll be complaining about the heat!","Blue Mountain Shelter

Still more of the same today. Rest, finalize our resupply, and make sure everything is ready for us to leave in the morning. Yesterday when we arrived we found some Calgon Lavender Honey Epsom Salts in the hiker box. We went to the local hardware store and bought a $1.99 paint roller tray so Mary could soak her sore, blistered feet. Seemed to work quite well, she says it feels really good. The strong scent gives both of us a head ache, but I guess it is worth it if it helps her feet. Today we'll let her feet air out, and hopefully they will toughen up a bit. 
We were able to get a couple calls off to family and friends while we are here in town and have good cell phone service. Along the trail we may have service, but usually only enough for texting, not phone calls. Mary has been sending out texts once in a while as she knows her mom was worried about the cold weather. Now that we have the journal entries up to date, we will mostly turn on our phones to see if we have any texts from home that need attention, or if we need a shuttle, or we have a problem. We are at the library again so Mary can finish typing, and I can finish up today's journal entry. It is a really nice and friendly library here in Hiawassee. That's it for now, tomorrow we will be back on the trail.
Again, we apologize for any grammar, spelling, or other errors in our journal. We haven't had a nice day where we can just sit and write during the day, so much of this is from memory and done in a hurry. Alan just got back from Rite-Aid with an adapter so we can hopefully upload some photos!","Hiawassee, GA

Up pretty early to catch the 9:00 shuttle back to Unicoi Gap. Shuttle was full to the brim with 11 people leaving. Everyone except Mary & I were going back to Dick's Creek Gap so we had a longer ride and arrived at Unicoi around 9:45. Still pretty cold, but once we got hiking up Rocky Mountain we warmed quickly. Soon we were down to a single layer with no hat or gloves, hiking in perfect weather with not a cloud in the sky. Made good time up over Rocky Mountain down into the gap and started up Tray Mountain. 
We broke the climb up today with lunch at Tray Gap. As we reached the summit of Tray we met a trail maintainer who calls himself ""Rock Kicker"" because he clears all the rocks off the trail. We thanked him for his work and all the work his fellow maintainers do. He also suggested places to eat in Hiawassee, and said Barney's was a good place for a burger and beer.  
Once we were up and over Tray, we went to Tray Mountain Shelter for a rest and to check the log. When we arrived we met Richard and Jennifer who we had seen several times earlier in the hike. They also started on the 7th, and stayed at Stover Creek that first cold night. They headed out, Mary stretched, and I went to fill up on water as we may dry camp tonight depending on how far we go. When we got ready to go we noticed that there was a full 64 ounce Sawyer sitting on the fire pit. We thought it belonged to Richard and Jennifer, so I grabbed the 4 pound plus bladder and strapped it to my pack hoping to catch them later down the trail. We hiked for a couple of miles but were unable to catch them. A mile or so later we found them getting water down a blue blazed trail. I asked Jennifer if they had left something at the last shelter, and she replied ""I don't think so"". I said you didn't leave your Sawyer at the shelter, and she said no, it must have been the hikers that were leaving as we arrived. 
I hiked the Sawyer bladder a couple more miles to Sassafras where we thought everyone would be. When we arrived I asked around and was told that the Sawyer bladder was sitting there for the past day. I was kind of dejected when I realized it was a wasted effort. There were quite a few people camping at Sassafras Gap including Richard and Jennifer, and Emily who we haven't seen since Hawk Mountain Shelter. A little warmer tonight, but still very windy. It took both of us to secure the ground cloth and tent to set it up. Cooked a quick meal, hung our bearbag and climbed into our bags around 7:45 pm.","Unicoi Gap

Very windy all night, but not as cold. When we awoke we thought it was early, but no, once again it was already 7:45. Rushed to pack and hit the trail to get to the Top of Georgia Hostel early enough to get all of our chores done. 
Even though we only did 6.3 today, we started with a tough climb out of Addis Gap up over Kelly Knob, and that really slowed our progress. Coming down the other side Mary's pinky toes were really bothering her so we stopped at the entrance to Deep Gap Shelter to try a different sock combination. 
By the time we were making the final descent down Powell Mountain, it had turned quite warm and we were down to shorts/skirt and tee shirts. We met Rock Kicker again, this time coming in from Dick's Creek Gap. We stopped and had another pleasant chat with him. By the time we made it to Dick's Creek Gap Mary's feet were very sore and she was moving slowly. We still had to make the 1/2 mile down the road to the hostel. We started down the road, but Mary's feet were really bothering her and she thought the tape had come off. Just as we decided to stop and re-tape, a gentleman in a pickup truck offered us a ride. We were very thankful, and he brought us right up to the front door of the hostel. 
Lots of familiar faces at the hostel - Richard, Jennifer, Fishtail, Pesto, Emily and we met a couple of new hikers, Nick & Shawn (who we call Stray Cat). We got our bunks, gave them our laundry (which they do for you), and got our free soda. When you give them the laundry they give you a towel and hospital scrubs so you can shower and put on clean clothes while yours are being washed. There were a lot of doctor jokes being made with everyone in scrubs & Crocs. 
At 4:00 anyone that wanted to could be shuttled to town for a resupply at Ingles, and a chance to get something to eat. The recommendation was Daniels AYCE, Barney's for burger & beer, or a Mexican place. Mary and I chose Barney's along with Stray Cat & Nick. The food and beer were good and we had a fun time laughing and joking with both Nick & Stray Cat. There was also a group of Thru-hikers there from the Budget Inn, which is right across the street. We pretended we couldn't socialize with them because we were of much higher class. After dinner we walked to Ingles for a resupply before being picked back up. All in all it was a good time of resting and hanging out with some new friends.","Sassafras Gap

Our plan was to make the 8:00 shuttle back to the trail so we could finish Georgia today. Of course at 6:00 a.m. we awoke to a clap of thunder and a downpour. The rain didn't last long, and by the time we were packed and had our breakfast it had stopped. (Breakfast was a free cereal buffet with your choice of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate). 
The forecast was for rain for the next two days, so many got another night. When we were dropped off we had our rain gear and pack covers on, but once we started we had to remove them as it was too hot and the rain had pretty much stopped. We hiked into Plum Orchard Shelter where we met Logan again. He was looking a little dejected. He had word from home that he may have to get off trail due to family issues. He was still waiting for a text, and trying to decide whether to go on or hike back to Dick's Creek Gap. 
After lunch at Plum Orchard we hiked on and the weather warmed enough that we got down to shorts/skirt and tee shirts which felt really good. It is a good climb to send you out of Georgia and into North Carolina. So, by the time we reached the state line we were pretty tired, but also pretty excited to have the first state done. 
We hiked just a short distance further to Bly Gap where we set up camp by ourselves at about 4,000 feet. Soon a section hiker that is hiking to Virginia came in and set up next to us. Then Michelle, Emily, and ""Mojave"", as well as three other hikers down the hill and one hiker who set up on top came in. When we first arrived we thought we would be alone for the night, but that certainly wasn't the case. It was a nice night, and we had a small fire and chatted with Michelle & Emily.","Dick's Creek Gap

Well, what started off as a nice night ended with a bang. Shortly after we went to bed we saw lightning flashes in the distance. Soon it was all around us, and we endured quite a storm at 4,000 feet which ended with some hail and strong wind. We all survived and did get some sleep, but it was all the conversation in the morning both at our camp and at the next shelter up (Muskrat Creek). Mary said once the lightning settled down and the wind started she heard some loud noises (it sounded similar to splitting a dry log on a log splitter, then a loud ""pop"", but extra loud) followed by a tree falling. We heard someone's ZPack Cuben Fiber tent had lots of holes from the hail. When I got up at 5:00 am the sky was clear and the stars were shining bright. 
Unfortunately, when we got out of the tent about 7:30 a.m. we were in a cloud and you could hardly see 40 feet. We packed up everything damp, had warm tea and half cooked oatmeal as my canister was getting low and I didn't  want to get the new one out. Before heading out we got a picture of the Bly Gap Tree, which is looking pretty sad.  We also got pictures yesterday of a small rock that someone had painted the word ""laugh"" on, as well as a small ""fairy house"" along the trail complete with a hammock & fence, very cute. We finished the steep climb out of Bly Gap to the top of Courthouse Bald where it was perfectly clear and we were above the clouds. We had great views, which was nice. We were moving a little slow this morning due to lack of energy.
We need to do better on our resupply and pack more food, especially snacks. I think we run low on energy because we aren't eating enough for the work we are doing. Stopped into Muskrat Creek Shelter for a snack, foot soak, and a stretch. The creek was too cold to soak for too long. We pushed on as it was too early for lunch. We eventually got to Water Oak Gap where it was nice and sunny, so we had lunch and pulled out our wet tent to dry while we ate. Emily soon arrived and did the same with her tent. 
(Have to catch a shuttle, will finish later tonight, I hope!)
Ok, back to finish the entry:
We talked about where to stay, the next shelter isn't too far, but after that shelter is Standing Indian, which is 5,500 feet, and we didn't want to camp there. After arriving at the next shelter (Standing Indian Shelter) we decided to eat dinner and try to push on over Standing Indian Mountain and camp on the other side, that way we'll have fewer miles in the upcoming days. Michelle & Emily stayed at Standing Indian Shelter and wished us luck. 
The climb wasn't bad at all as it was an old road bed. We made good time to the top and had great views. I think having dinner first helped with our energy level. We didn't dally too long on top as we wanted to get down to lower elevation since we heard there may be another thunder storm tonight. The grade was good, but unfortunately we were having trouble finding any campsites. We ended up pushing further than we wanted to Beech Creek Gap. We were both tired when we arrived, and it was nearing dark. The campsite was nice, and we quickly set up. When I went for water I didn't realize it was 1/4 mile down a trail, so I didn't bring my head lamp. It was getting quite dark as I was heading back, and about halfway back I started hearing coyotes yipping behind me about where I thought I had just gotten water. Their yipping and yelping put a little spring in my step the rest of the way back. Another good day, but we are both very tired. Will try for a shorter day tomorrow.","Bly Gap

We had a good night last night, very little rain, and when we awoke we had time enough to eat and pick up before it started sprinkling. We started hiking with our rain gear and pack covers on. After hiking a short distance the rain gear came off. We made the 3 or so miles to Carter Gap Shelter for a break pretty quickly, and there was a lot of discussion at the shelter about getting to town as soon as possible as there was possible snow in the forecast for Wednesday. 
We were planning on a short day into town Wednesday, and decided to make reservations at the Comfort Inn. With our reservations made, we planned where to stay to make it easiest for a short day into town. We figured a short hike to Betty Creek would work, but about the time we got back hiking it clouded over and began to rain. Pack cover and rain gear back on as the rain grew steadier and harder. When we arrived at Betty Creek it was way too early to set up in the rain and sit in the tent for half a day, so we continued on without stopping. 
By the time the rain let up we were starting up Albert Mountain, and figured we should just get over it and camp on the other side. We leap frogged with eight or so hikers all day. When we arrived at the bypass to Albert Mountain there was a whole group that directed us to the by-pass saying the trail around was this way. Mary responded that we were going up over Mt Albert, even though it was wet and foggy. I was very proud watching her just take off over the very steep, almost rock scramble as the whole group of guys wished us luck, and said kudos to you as they took the road around the steep summit section. 
It was a short but tough climb up to the tower at the summit where there were no views, but we took some pictures anyway. Once we started down Mt Albert, we realized there wasn't much camping as they are doing some restoration projects of the former camping spot. So, we decided to just continue on to Long Branch Shelter. Because we did a couple of bigger days, we will make town a day early. We will probably zero even though Mary's feet are feeling better. I think the extra day  of rest will help us in the long run.","Beech Gap

Had the alarm set for 6:00 a.m. so we would have enough time to pack up and make the 7.2 miles to Winding Stair Gap to catch the 12:30 bus into town. As we packed it was still dark with the stars out. Everything is soaking wet and muddy from the rain and small thunderstorm we had last night. Decided to just get stuff into our packs and have a bar for breakfast and get going. We will deal with the muddy mess when we get to town. 
As we headed out we decided to leave a note for Emily that we had secured a room at the comfort Inn if she wanted to split it. We left the note in a baggy at the entrance to the shelter saying ""Emily from Minnesota"" with the pertinent information. We made good time up over one hill and down into Rock Gap. We decided to have a quick ""real"" breakfast of oatmeal and tea at the Rock Gap Shelter and decided we should be able to make Winding Stair Gap by 12:30 if we didn't dally too long. Tough steep climb out of Rock Gap, but then a nice ridge walk and long descent into Winding Stair Gap. On the descent we met a hiker we had been looking for since just before Blood Mountain, ""Papa Dale"". Apparently he had taken a nasty fall near Betty Creek and had to go to the hospital. He was slack packing South Bound from Wayah Bald to Rock Gap and then heading into Franklin. We chatted and said we would probably see him in town later. 
We made it to the gap in plenty of time and waited with a couple of young thru-hikers, Taylor from New Hampshire and Katherine from North Carolina who are hiking together. We stretched, and the shuttle soon arrived to bring us to the Comfort Inn. We had called along the trail to secure another night since we would be arriving on Tuesday, instead of Wednesday. 
The Comfort Inn is very nice, clean, and comfortable, and we are glad we decided to spend a little more money this time for our zero stay. Papa Dale and the others who were slack packing (Tabasco, Kingsman, Stub, Pass Me, and 1other hiker who we can't remember their names are also all here. They informed us that they are going to Wild Billy's BBQ at 6:00 tonight and to join them. We hustled to get our chores done as our gear is a mess. We showered, did laundry, dishes, cleaned and dried the tent, and generally ""sanitized"" our gear that's been lying in filth the last few days. 
We soon got a call from Emily saying she saw our note and would love to join us. We gave her the room number and she arrived not too long after. She said our note inspired her to hike on with the thought of a clean, dry room awaiting. We tried to clear some space in the room as our packs had exploded and we had gear strewn about the room. Mary and I headed across the street to Ingles to get a few more cleaning supplies and to give Emily a chance to get cleaned up. 
Once we all got settled it was 6:00 and we walked up the hill to join the other hikers for dinner. We ate pretty hearty as we really hadn't had lunch. Pulled Pork dinners and IPA's were on the menu. Again it feels good to be clean, full, and have a good group to converse with. I think everyone is getting stronger and getting into the groove. With snow and cold forecast, I think the zero will be wise.","Long Branch Shelter

After a good night sleep we went downstairs to the breakfast area to have a cup of tea. It was funny to see the local news crews talking about the spring snow storm . They had the news crew out on the highway showing the flurries that weren't even sticking to the roads. If you looked close you could see a dusting on the grass. Apparently they are getting more serious snow in the higher elevations and in the Smoky Mountains. 
We decided to take the shuttle to the First Baptist Church where they do a pancake breakfast for the hikers every morning. When we arrived we realized we were too late and had missed it. In true southern hospitality the woman cleaning up invited us in and offered the three of us bacon, some banana's and apples as well as orange juice, coffee and tea. We chatted for some time about how they started in 2008 and how it has evolved through the years. I checked out my signature on the 2011 banner and was pleasantly surprised to see the thank you card with my 2011 Katahdin summit picture posted with several others on the wall of honor. They had to get to work so we headed next door to Rollie Pollies for another cup of tea and a biscuit sandwich while we waited for the outfitters to open at 10:00. 
We headed to the Outdoor 76 outfitter when they opened to browse. Both Mary and Emily, who we've decided should use the trail name of ""Minnie"" that she was given since she was from Minnesota, had the owner/foot guru measure and recommend footwear for them. When I say measure I mean he took a sharpie and marked various pressure points and other areas on their feet, a process that took 15 to 20 minutes. Then, he took a great deal of time having them try several different hiking shoes to find the ""perfect"" fit and comfort level. Mary eventually found something she thought would work if her feet don't continue to feel better and will have those sent to her at a later date if necessary. ""Minnie"" found a pair she decided to purchase, and hopes they will help make the rest of her hike more comfortable. Had a quick beer at the bar in the Outdoor 76 and then Mary and I headed to the hostel nearby in hopes of finding the hiker who dropped their hat coming into Winding Stair Gap. No luck finding the owner, so we headed to the local library to start working on the journal updates. Luckily, the bus driver told us he was the last bus of the day, and we would need to be back at the bus stop outside the library in an hour to catch a ride back to our hotel. 
Got as much of the journal updated as we could, then caught the bus back to the Comfort Inn. Did our resupply at Ingles (unfortunately it is not the larger Ingles...) and then headed back to our room to organize our food and gear for the next stretch. Another yummy dinner at Willy's BBQ and back to the hotel again to finalize our preparations for the next leg of the hike. Hope to hit the First Baptist Church pancake breakfast in the morning and then head back to the trail on the noon bus. Hopefully not too much snow on the trails in the mountains, it is supposed to be sunny but cold tomorrow night.
Note: We update the journal when ever we can find a computer in town. So, we usually add several entries at a time. Hope you enjoy following along, and thanks for reading.
Thank you to all who have signed our guest book and wishing us well on our hike. And thank you Linda & John for the offer of a ride, unfortunately we didn't see that until we were already in town. But, thankfully Franklin has an excellent bus service for hikers.","Franklin

First off, we are today (March 27) at Fontana Lodge  - Laundry room has 5 of each machine, but only 1 of each works, so Alan is waiting in line to do our laundry (they need a repair man! Many hikers here, and all want to wash their smelly clothes). On another note, when we get to today's entry if we have time, we will title it ""CUJO"", or maybe, ""WHO LET THE DOGS OUT""...
Ok, on to the journal now:
Alarm set so we could make the Baptist Church pancake breakfast. Myself, Mary & Minnie were picked up by the church van and brought to the breakfast where we had all the pancakes, bacon, oj & tea we wanted. They also took our pictures to mail home to our loved ones (Kyle & Caiden & Kable, hope you received them). 
After getting our fill we returned to the motel to pack up and check out. We had a little time to kill before the 12:00 shuttle so we did get to put our feet up for a while. Once we got picked up we were detoured several times for other pick ups, so we didn't arrive at Winding Stair Gap until 12:30 or so. The mountains are all white now at elevation, but the sun was shining. We started up, but soon had to remove some clothing as it wasn't too cold. The trail was a muddy, sloppy, mess. We didn't see many other hikers as we climbed out of the gap. Not sure why, but neither of us had any energy today. We struggled with our legs being sore and being very tired in general. As we climbed and the temperature dropped, there was no longer mud but packed snow. Snow still clung to the trees, and in some places the drifts were 18 inches or so. We made it up and over Silars Bald and headed to Wayah Bald. 
We both were so tired, and after a late start decided to just make it to Wine Spring Meadow to camp. When we arrived at the turn we saw no footprints, only 3-4 inches of untracked snow. We checked it out and found two large grassy areas that only had a little snow as most had blown off. We quickly set up camp as the temperatures continued to drop. We quickly ate (the first time we actually ate in the tent due to the cold!), hung a bear bag, and heated a water bottle for Mary's sleeping bag. We did get a nice sunset, as we camped at 5,300 feet. Off to the sleeping bag as it is getting colder!","Franklin

So far the theme for this hike is cold! As soon as we hit the bags the temperature plunged and the wind picked up. It was more of a survival sleep than what I would call a comfortable night. We both slept in socks, long john bottoms, long sleeve tops, and down coats inside our down bags with liners. Hat, gloves and neck warmers also on, and at times both of us were chilly (down right cold). Probably not dangerously so, but not comfortable at all. We got up at first light, put everything we had on, had a Pop-Tart and got moving. We did warm up, but not many layers came off very quickly. It was slow going as the pathway was hard packed snow, or where it warmed up enough yesterday and turned to slush it was now ice. We made our way up and over Wayah Bald where we got some great views. Made it to Cold Spring shelter for a late lunch where we met some trail maintainers who were out blazing a new trail to get a trail crew into the shelter. They were kind enough to pack out our trash, as well as everyone elses trash. (Including trash left in the shelter by thoughtless hikers). They also said they wish they could do more for us all, the people who maintain the trails are really amazing. It was finally warming up, but also clouding up and looking like rain. Everyone is saying definitely rain tomorrow. We would have liked to get closer to the NOC, but by the time we made it to Tellico Gap, where another maintainer (John), who we saw earlier told us we might find a spot to pitch our tent, we were done. We decided tackling Wesser Bald will wait for the morning. We hope to get up early as we still have about 8 miles to the NOC and we want to beat the rain. The PCT crowd is with us tonight, TNT, Blackbird, and Crafty. Also camping here is a section hiker, I think his name is Jeff. Not the best of spots as the road is right here, and we are camped in parking spaces. Good night from the trail for now as we dream of good food, and maybe even a beer tomorrow.","Wine Spring Meadow

Wasn't the best night as we got some sprinkles, but worse we had a car honk its horn as it went by, and some vehicle parked nearby and idled for sometime. None the less, we were up early and packing dreaming of town food. (Mary here, asking what you think I am currently craving for food... I'll let you know at a future time so you can make your guesses). 
The day started with a steep climb up over Wesser Bald, we climbed the tower and got some 360° views. As we started our descent toward the NOC we went over a ledgey, rocky, steep section called the jump off. It had excellent views, but let's just say Mary was less than thrilled about being on the narrow ledge. (Mary's comment - I felt like a beginner skier on a triple black diamond trail). I haven't mentioned it yet, but over the last 4 or 5 days we have hiked through some real fired damaged area. I think most of the damage is from 2016, and I think one ridgerunner said they had 23 separate fires that year. Apparently the Gatlinburg  fire got all the press, but they had a lot of damage in this area. The ledgey area we hiked in today had extensive damage. Not just ground fire, but up into the trees. Some areas are so steep and remote I doubt there is much they can do when the fires hit. 
It was a long downhill into the NOC, dropping about 3,000 feet, and Mary was ready to be done for the day. We arrived and couldn't check into our bunks until 3:00 so we headed to the restaurant and I had a burger and beer and Mary had a salad with grilled chicken on it and a beer. When we finished we checked out the outfitters, and tried texting Minnie about an extra bunk we have in our bunk room. There were many hikers milling about at the waterfront. I happened to see Logan ""Poseidon"" out front and he said he needed a bunk, so he will be bunking in our room. When we booked we couldn't get a double bunk room, so we had to get a quad and had two bunks to spare. 
Mary's big toe on her left foot was bothering her coming down the long downhill today so she looked again at some hiking shoes. She tried a pair of men's Brooks Cascadias on in the size the foot guru at the Outdoor 76 had suggested, and she said they felt really comfortable. With sore feet that is saying something, so we made the purchase and have bounced her old shoes on to Hot Springs to see how things go with the new ones. Heard from Minnie, she had already reserved a bunk before she got our text, and they said no refunds. So, we have paid for a four bunk room and will only use 3 bunks... We were going to meet her for dinner, but we ordered a pizza to eat in the bunkhouse instead of going to the restaurant again. Of course when I went to pick up the pizza it started pouring and I got soaked. We had done our resupply at the store before it closed, so of course we also picked up a couple of micro-brews to enjoy with our pizza. The pizza and beer were good, and we are very happy we stayed because a storm is rolling through now with much thunder, lightning, and rain. Off to bed as we'll start the next 3 day leg to Fontana and then it will be on to the Smoky's!","Tellico Gap

Rained all night, so we were happy to be warm and dry. Packed early and had left over pizza for breakfast. As we got ready to leave we remembered Mary's new shoes don't have the Velcro on the back to attach her Dirty Girl Gaiters. Made the trip back down to the outfitters where they hooked us up (no pun intended) with some Velcro at no charge. They even attached it and gave us some spare in case we have future problems. 
At this point we decided to enjoy another cup of tea as the one we brewed in the common room this morning tasted kind of metallic. So, off to the restaurant again for tea. And, of course since we were already at a restaurant we couldn't pass up a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. 
Minnie came in while we were eating and we told her our plans to Fontana, but apparently she is going to zero here and push on through the Smoky's. We wished her well and headed out. 
It's a brutal climb out of the NOC, climbing over 5,000 feet culminating with a very steep final pitch up to Cheoah Bald. We were fortunate enough to get some great views and pictures from the summit. (We were surprised to see a couple of hikers go by who didn't even stop to check out the view...). We also reserved a room at the Fontana Lodge for Tuesday night while we had service. 
Long, slow descent into Locust Cove Gap over some slick, muddy rocks. Mary was not thrilled with this as she took a slip on one that made her a little gun shy on the rest. Both sore tonight, Mary's legs and feet and my feet. Pretty long day planned for tomorrow, so we will try to get going early.","NOC

Note - only 1 computer here, so I'm rushing. Will have to go back and update where we slept (tent, hostel, hotel etc..)
Up pretty early, but we did take time for a hot breakfast and tea as it was a little warmer than it has been. The day started with some rolling terrain, then a down into Stecoah Gap. 
Once we headed back up into the mountain we encountered ""Jacob's Ladder"" a .6 mile stretch of trail that is extremely steep with no switch backs. It definitely took its toll. We made Brown Fork Shelter for lunch and found some hiker fast asleep in the shelter, not really sure of the story because he tossed a little but didn't get up. 
We still needed to make over six miles, so we headed out over a lot of quick ups and downs. Quite a few hikers went by us hustling to the shelter, so they will be set up for an early day into Fontana. When we arrived at camp there were already quite a few hikers there, and we found a semi-level spot for our tent. We ate, and watched more and more hikers come in. Going to be very full tonight. 
Off to bed, looking forward to a nice town stop before we hit the Smoky's. Final note, as I type this ""Kingsman"" stopped by and mentioned his daughter asked if anyone he had hiked with has a Trailjournal. He said no, but a short time later found ours. He is hiking with Tobasco, Papa Dale, and Pass me (who went home for a bit to check on work and family). 
Have to go, that's it for now. Hiker waiting for the computer, thankfully I'm pretty well caught up. Do want to mention that we have also seen a lot of hurricane damage along the trail, especially in Georgia.","Locust Cove Gap

Even though our tent site was not that great, if we lay on the edge of our neo-air mattress just right we could get pretty comfortable. But, being comfortable didn't mean we got much sleep as about the time everyone was hitting the hay a couple of local dogs came into camp and started running around and barking every time someone or something moved. This went on all night, each time any noise was made the two dogs would run up and down the hill barking continually and sniffing around everyone's tents. We weren't sure if they were friendly or not, but in the morning we saw they had collars and seemed friendly, if not a little skiddish. 
We woke pretty early and started packing to get to town. About the time we were ready to leave, the dogs were gone. We heard from Katherine and Taylor that the dogs ran in and out of the shelter all night and those sleeping in the shelter were concerned about their neo-air mattresses getting damaged, and their sleeping bags getting dirty from the dogs. 
A couple of little ups and then one big down to the road. After the ups Mary set out on a torrid pace downhill, determined not to let anyone pass her (This was after I said the wildebeest were being chased from behind...). She did well for a couple of miles, but soon she got tired and when the down got steeper and rockier she eventually had to let a few hikers pass us. We made good time down none the less and quickly called for the Fontana Lodge shuttle. 
By the way, as we came out of the woods there was a guy standing by a truck who asked if we ""spent the night with his dogs"". We said they were in camp for the night, but had left early in the morning. He said the dogs go up to that shelter all the time, and maybe they went back home the other way. He was waiting to make sure they didn't try to cross the road. 
We checked into our room and decided to get our laundry started before lunch. Unfortunately, when we got to the laundry room they had 5 stacked washer/dryers and only one worked. We were 2nd on the list that was started, but it took a long time. Mary went to work on the journal and I stayed to do our laundry. 
By the time the laundry was done, the restaurant had stopped serving lunch and wouldn't open until 5:00 for dinner. We grabbed a couple of snacks from the store while we did our resupply to hold us over until dinner. We didn't need much of a resupply as we had a package sent to the lodge and it arrived in time. We hung out and organized stuff until it was time for dinner. We were first in line at the restaurant and had a good meal. 
We have most of our stuff organized for tomorrow, so off to bed because tomorrow is a big climb into the Smoky Mountains. 
Side note, Fontana Lodge is a nice place to stop. The Lodge is clean, rooms are good, restaurant is good and the resupply is adequate if not a little pricey (which is to be expected). We were however disappointed that they didn't seem to care about the laundry situation as some machines had an out of service tag dated long ago. Also, when I stayed here in 2011 the courtesy van picked you up and brought you to the lodge free of charge if you were staying on site. Now it is $3 per person each way whether or not you are staying at the lodge or just coming up to resupply. I know this is just the start of the season for them, but this place is bustling with a lot of hikers spending a lot of money, which I think is probably a bonus for them this time of year.","Cable Gap Shelter

We were up early all packed up, but decided on a good hearty breakfast at the restaurant rather then Pop-tarts and an early shuttle. Had nice omelettes, homefries, and biscuits and then caught a later shuttle back to the trail. 
First we had to follow the edge of the lake through the woods to the dam, then cross the dam and walk the road up to the Great Smoky Mountain Park entrance. We were dressed for colder weather, but by the time we made it to the dam we already decided to change into shorts/skirt and t-shirts. Who knew after what we had seen for weather so far the Smokys would start this warm! 
Long, slow trek up to the Shuckstack fire tower where we had lunch. Took some pictures from the tower and then continued our climb up to the ridge. When we finally reached Doe Knob we entered Tennessee for the first time. Won't leave North Carolina behind for good for some time as the trail is the state line for a while. 
Made it to the shelter quite late as it was a big, tiring day. We had finished our water a while back, but when we got to camp a hiker asked ""did you get your water back down the hill? I hope so, because the water at the shelter is contaminated with Norovirus"". This was not what we wanted to hear. 
We gathered water in a spare bladder I had and decided to boil some to drink and cook dinner with, and also enough to brush our teeth. We knew we could get water at the next shelter tomorrow. Bad news is that it's so windy it took a long time to boil the water and we used the rest of our fuel canister. I have another canister, but it is doubtful it will go the entire length of the Smokies. We brought all meals we have to cook since we thought it would be cold in the Great Smoky Mountains. This may put a monkey wrench in our plans to hike all the way through the Smokies without getting off trail. So tired that we ate, brushed our teeth and hit the hay after a long tough day.","Fontana Lodge

Wind picked up last night, but no rain and still not too cold. No bears last night even though there was a warning and hikers said one had visited the shelter the last two nights. What we did have, but we didn't get to see, was some wild hogs. Just before the shelter the ground was all rooted up in quite a large area. It wasn't like that the previous evening. 
Trying to conserve fuel, so we had half cooked oatmeal and no tea. Headed out, still sore from yesterdays hike. Lots of little ups and downs today. Made the first shelter where we got good water and cleaned all our dishes. 
Lots of hikers on the trail this morning all trying to make it to the shelter before the rain. I didn't mention that when we arrived at camp last night the shelter was full and there were 15 - 20 tents set up near the shelter. The miles between shelters is kind of weird; from where we stayed you would have to do 3.1, 6, or 12.1 miles to get to a shelter. So, most of the same people will be going the 12.1. (In the Smoky Mountains you have to stay in a shelter unless it is full, then you can set up your tent near the shelter). 
Really windy today with it blowing so hard at times it was hard to stay on the trail going up over Thunderhead Mountain. The views were great today with the sky varying between sun and looking like it might rain. We dragged ourselves into camp, again one of the last to arrive, but we made it just as far as everyone else.
Lots of tenting again tonight with another full shelter. Got our chores all done and ate at a reasonable time despite having to go a long way for water. Again we arrived and had someone tell us that we should not use the water at the shelter as people had pooped all around it. We had a hiker advise us to go up the trail a little ways and take the side ""trail"" to water. The little ways turned out to be .3 miles down Derrick Knob and then another couple hundred yards through the woods to a spring and then back up the .3 miles to the shelter again. 
I'm not sure why the park thinks it is a good idea to tell everyone they have to stay at the shelters and then do not have privies. They tell you to get water on one side and use the other side as the ""toilet area"". Some people seem to be pigs, going behind just about every tree and leaving toilet paper everywhere. Very gross! Sorry for the rant, but I don't understand how people can be so disgusting. Managed to get everything cleaned, bear bag hung, teeth brushed, and into the tent just as the first raindrops began to fall. We are now in the middle of a good rainstorm with some thunder and lightning to boot. Good night for now...","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Woke to fairly cool, cloudy conditions. Not really raining, but threatening to. Lots of short, steep, little bumps today early made for some warm hiking in our rain gear. I managed to get my light down jacket soaking wet from sweat because I didn't want to take the time to stop and take it off, dumb mistake. 
Unlike our original plan of going all the way through the Smokies, we now think we will go into town at Newfound Gap. We passed a couple of milestones today. We made the 200 mile mark just after Clingmans Dome, which is another milestone as it is the highest point on the AT at 6,658 feet. Prior to Clingmans we stopped at Double Spring Shelter for lunch where we met Papa Dale, Tabasco, and Kingsman as well as Bubbs all finishing their lunch. They have decided to stay at this shelter so they will have a good day over Clingmans Dome to enjoy the views. We met a ridge runner having lunch who checked our permits and we chatted with her about different aspects of the trail. She let us know that there was no norovirus in the Smoky Mountains, and they have not had it here in the last two years (guess we didn't need to boil the water...). She also told us the bear problem at Mollies Ridge was due to a hiker using an ursack and thinking the bear would not bother it. Mary thanked her for all that she and the other ridge runners do to keep the trail in shape for the hikers (she has to clean the privies, pick up trash, bury poop left behind by thoughtless hikers, etc). 
Off we headed to Clingmans, and as we started getting closer the skies seemed to lighten and we even saw a few glimpses of the sun. It was quite windy and we were hoping the wind would push the fog away in time for us to get some good views. No such luck, within 15 to 20 minutes as we got closer to the top it was starting to snow. By the time we reached the tower it was socked in and it was snowing/sleeting pretty good. We went up the tower anyway along with several other hikers, knowing we would not see any views. We didn't stay long as it was cold, so we started back off down the trail to Mt Collins shelter. The guide book said it was 2.7 miles away, but the sign post said it was 4 miles. Seems like the sign post may have been right as it took us a long time to reach the shelter over a rocky, muddy, slick trail. As we traveled down the temperatures dropped. I was getting chilled in just my raincoat and long sleeve shirt. Put on my hat and gloves, but it was still very cool. 
Finally made it to the shelter which is 1/2 mile off trail. Whole area was very wet and muddy, but we managed to find a spot that was kind of level and not under water. We set up our still wet tent just as it started to sleet again. Quickly ate and got to bed as the temperature was dropping. Took us a long while to warm up in our still damp stuff from last night. Predicting a nice day tomorrow, and we are going to Gatlinburg if we can get a ride. Looking forward to a hot shower and warm bed.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Awoke this morning to very cold temperatures, low 20's or maybe teens. Tent zippers were frozen and the wet fly was now covered in ice. My body heat must have drawn the moisture from my damp clothing out through my sleeping bag and it condensed on top because my bag had a layer of water on top near my chest and ice on top by my feet. No wonder I was chilled this morning. Put on several layers to fight off the cold and picked up our frozen tent. Nothing like putting on frozen shoes on already cold feet. Ate some quick snacks and got moving toward Newfound Gap. 
Crystal clear day and not a cloud in the sky. We warmed up quickly and began shedding layers as the sun warmed us as we hiked. Word spread quickly from day hikers heading south that there was coffee and donuts at the gap for thru-hikers. We hustled as that sounded quite good. As we neared the gap it had become a beautiful day with great views in all directions, and now it was quite warm. As we arrived we found dozens of thru-hikers gathered around Ed's car (he was providing the trail magic). He had more than just donuts and coffee; he also had string cheese, slim jims, ramen, fruit, and tons of other items thru-hikers might need/want. He gave Mary a pair of ear plugs in case we need to stay in a shelter. 
Most of the hikers were lounging around in the now warm weather talking about whether to go to Gatlinburg or continue on the trail. The parking lot was full with hundreds of people, cars, and tour buses. We were looking around for a ride when suddenly one of the hikers that Ed was going to take to town found another ride so Ed said he would take Mary and I to Gatlinburg when he was done with trail magic in about 20 minutes. We were very happy and thankful, not only did he provide us with donuts and more, he was giving us a ride all the way to Gatlinburg. So we were on our way to town with Flo-bo who also was riding to town with Ed. I was able to call from the gap and get a room at Johnson's Inn. Being Easter weekend, rooms were scarcer and priced high. One that was listed at $44.95 in the book quoted me 128.95 plus tax. 
Once in town we did all the normal stuff, did laundry in our rain gear at the hotel, dried our tent, packs, and shoes, and set out to take the trolley to Food City to resupply. Mind you, Gatlinburg is in full swing with wall to wall people everywhere. It was all a bit overwhelming coming from the woods to the mob scene that was Gatlinburg on Easter weekend! It took us a bit, but we did figure out the trolley and made quick work of our resupply. We caught the trolley, got dropped off across the street from Food City, did our resupply in the 20 minutes it took the trolley to finish its route and pick us back up to head back to town. We were waiting at the trolley stop for the return trip for just 4 or 5 minutes before it was there to pick us back up. 
We walked to the outfitters rather than wait for another trolley which would have to sit in traffic. We had to walk to the far end of the strip which was certainly a sensory overload. Got what we needed then headed to Bennett's BBQ for dinner. Mary had salad with BBQ chicken (by the way, that is what Mary craves when on the trail, salad...). I ate way too much, but Mary saved room for a Ben & Jerry's on the way back to the room. 
We had dried everything out in the sun earlier, so we got everything packed and organized for an early departure tomorrow. Hopefully we will find a ride, we are a little nervous because it will be Easter Sunday.","Mt Collins Shelter

Up early, ate oatmeal and enjoyed a cup of tea in our room to use up some extra oatmeal we had. Packed our bags and walked to the strip toward the park again. We had been told you can't hitch hike in town, you have to wait until you're in the park. As we walked we hoped someone would stop and pick us up, but no one did. We walked the entire strip and were just about to enter the park when a guy in a truck at the last gas station asked if we were thru-hiking and were going back to the gap. We said yes, and he said let me put this oil in my truck and I'll give you a ride. We gladly accepted, and as we waited I noticed a wrench sitting on the side of his truck under the hood. I mentioned the wrench, and he said he was glad I noticed it as it belongs to his mechanic and is an expensive wrench. Once were were on the way we found out he hikes quite a bit, and had hiked from Harper's Ferry to Springer a few years ago. He had just come from the gap and giving us a ride was an inconvenience as it is 15 miles of windy road back up there. When we arrived we gave him some gas money and then thanked him profusely. His name was Todd, but his trail name is Toad, Sir Toad to the ladies. 
Kind of chilly at the gap, so we started with some layers but soon warmed up and ended up hiking in light layers for the rest of the day. It wasn't quite as nice as yesterday, but it was still warm with just some clouds around. We were happy because we hiked some of the prettiest parts of the park today. Stopped for a quick snack at Icewater Shelter and had some nice views as we stretched. Made it to Charlies Bunion, where we had lunch and had some stunning views. Even got Mary to go up on the rock ledge, have the photos to prove it. 
The rest of the day was mostly a ridge walk with great views around every corner. In 2011 when I did this I nearly froze to death at Icewater Shelter and did not see any views the entire day. Made it to the shelter at a reasonable hour, but there were very limited tent sites. Finally found a site up the hill near the privy. We joke with everyone who comes up that we are the guards of the privy. Fortunately the wind is blowing the right way so there is no smell. Warm enough to socialize a little tonight. Bubbs is here, Irish & Beach Bum are here, as is Steve who we met earlier on the trail. Will try for 13 miles tomorrow to set us up to leave the park and make Standing Bear the next day. 
Forgot to mention that today we met an 87 year old gentleman who is thru-hiking. His name is ""Pappy"", and we came upon him sitting on a water bar log having a drink of water. He told us his ""scout"" is saving him a spot in the shelter. Very interesting man who served in Korea as a linguist, he joked he ""could speak four languages, but can now barely speak one"". We wish him well and he is truly an inspiration to be doing this at the age of 87. 
On another note, Mary was standing beside the trail waiting for me when some other thru-hikers were coming up the trail. One of them said ""Oh, a southbounder, you're the first southbounder we've seen, when did you start?"" Mary was quick with her reply ""April Fools, right?"" They were trying to get her to think she was heading the wrong way...","Newfound Gap

The day started early as we were packing up before the sun was up. As always it was a climb as we left the shelter, including the .5 to get back to the trail. We hiked a series of ups for about 1 1/2 hours and then finally made it up and over 6,200 feet then a quick down to Tri-Corner Knob shelter for a rest and a quick snack. Mary is starting to get her hiker hunger, she was hungry all day today. 
Talked to Bubbs at the shelter, sad to hear that he will be getting off trail for personal reasons. Sad to see him go as he is a really nice guy that we have camped with off and on over the last couple of weeks. Most of the rest of the day was a nice ridge walk with great views again. We managed to eat lunch at Deer Creek Gap with a great view, and a grassy area to sit with our shoes and socks off. 
Again, pretty warm today, so we feel fortunate. After walking the ridge at over 6,000 feet for some time we began our descent out of the Smoky Mountains. Got to the shelter fairly early tonight, though once again not many good tent sites to be had. Found a fairly level site down near the fire ring. Actually had a little fire tonight as we ate. 
A steady stream of people arriving looking for tent spots. A section hiker set up in a spot next to us and later ""Sunshine"" from Vermont squeezed in close by. Her friend from New Hampshire, ""Chef Gordon Ramsey"" is also here at the fire ring eating. Bubbs, Irish and Beach Bum are tenting here as well, as are many other hikers we've met along the way. Should complete the Smoky Mountains tomorrow and make it to Standing Bear for resupply. I'm sure they will be packed as everyone here at the shelter is also going there. Will probably be up early to beat some of the crowd.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Up early to get going, but everyone else had the same idea. When we finally had stuff packed we saw that about half had already scampered out. Mary heard some hikers up and packing around 3:30 in the morning, apparently doing some night hiking. It is a nearly full moon, so I'm sure it worked out fine for them. We got a couple of pictures before we left as we had a really nice sun rise. 
About a 750 foot climb to start the day, but then a long, long, down hill out of the park. A lot of other hikers were zipping by us, racing to get to Standing Bear. Mary and I were enjoying the day, stopping to have a cup of tea and a snack on the trail once it warmed up. We made our way down slowly on what was fast becoming a warm day. 
Just about lunch time we arrived at the last shelter in the Smoky Mountains and debated whether to go in for lunch. We decided to go a little further out of the park to the road crossing and eat there. We met the other ridge runner starting her 5 day shift hiking in, she also checked our permits as we chatted. 
About 15 minutes later we arrived at the gap and saw a car parked, soon we had ""Trail Magic"", what a delight! Just what we needed on a now hot day. Lawn chairs, turkey, bread, mustard, mayo, chips, sweet tarts, and best of all 2 cases of Ice Cold Sierra Nevada IPA beer. It sure was better than what we had left for lunch, 1 tortilla, 1 pouch of tuna, and 1 pouch of spam. I was planning on eating the spam with no tortilla, and Mary was going to have tuna on the tortilla. 
""Bagheera"", or ""Bags"" for short, a 2017 thru-hiker had decided to come by to congratulate everyone for finishing the Smoky Mountains and to hear some stories from this years crop of hikers. She also shared some stories from last year. She goes by ""Bags"" because nobody could remember ""Bagheera"". Sure lifted our spirits and made for one of the best days yet. ""Bags"" works for Sierra Nevada giving tours of the brewery in Asheville. We each enjoyed a couple of sandwiches and a couple of beers as well as chips and sweet tarts. Bubbs was there, Irish and Beach Bum soon arrived and then Sassafras came in as well. There was one other hiker, I think he goes by TI84... We all shared many stories and were thankful we didn't rush today and miss this like many of the speedy hikers did. We hated to leave, but we still had three miles to go before Standing Bear. 
Made for some tough hiking in the heat after the beer and rest, but just before I-40 we came to a nice stream that we soaked our feet in and splashed water on the rest of our bodies to cool off. I had been in touch with my parents who are returning from Florida, and hopefully will meet us tonight at the hostel. 
When we made Standing Bear we were ready to be done for the night. Showered, claimed two of the last bunks (both top bunks of course), and cooked a frozen pizza for dinner. Soon my parents arrived and we had a nice long chat before they had to leave to find a place of their own to stay for the night. Washed my shirt on the old laundry board and hung it in a tree to dry. 
Off to bed on a tiring but over all good day. Bubbs tented at Standing Bear, Irish and Beach Bum went down the trail a little further to tent. Flo-bo was at Standing Bear as was Sha ling (not sure of spelling), Hannah, Sourpatch, Ulysses from NH, as well as Wicked who is from NH, and many others we have been hiking the trail with recently.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Not the best nights sleep in the bunkhouse as we had top bunks and the smoke from the fire blew in and got us both quite choked up. Resupply wasn't as good as we were hoping, but it will get us to Hot Springs. We are happy we had a roof over our head as it poured last night and we stayed dry. 
Just as we were heading back on the trail we met two section hikers who were starting their hike, ""Lewis & Clark"". Started out misty and foggy on the big climb out today going from 1600' to up over 4600' eventually. We soon shed clothing as we climbed, but had to put some back on as a thick fog rolled in with a cool breeze.
 Our first stop of the day was Snowbird Mountain. Just shy of the summit I stopped to put on my extra shirt, gloves and hat and Mary hiked on. Several different hikers passed by me while I was stopped on the trail. I soon hustled to catch up to Mary, again passing most of the hikers. When I reached the summit I saw a couple of hikers coming out of the short side trail to the FAA dish, but didn't see Mary. I thought she must be feeling better now that she reached the top and had her second wind, so I kept right on trucking,  picking up the pace to catch up. I hiked for about 15 minutes up over the top and a ways down the back side when I realized something was wrong. I normally would have caught her by now. I turned on my phone and got enough service to call twice, but could only leave a voicemail. Soon a voicemail came in from Mary sounding quite upset wondering where I was, because she was on the summit waiting for me. By now I was about a mile down the mountain from her. I quickly ditched my pack and started hiking/running back toward the top. We were finally able to get a call through to figure out where each other was. Somehow we missed each other in the fog on the summit. She had a little take on the story, but I'll let her relay that...
 Ok, this is Mary, and here is how it happened - When I got to the summit and saw the FAA tower I knew that we had discussed that Earl Grey might call Peregrine to tell him ""guess where I am"". Another hiker, Sarah, went up to the tower and said there were a couple of nice cars up there. I made a quick trip up, spoke briefly with a gentleman who was working at the tower and told him I better get back to the trail so I wouldn't miss my husband. After waiting a bit  ""Lewis & Clark"" came by and I asked if ""Earl Grey"" was coming. They told me he was behind them, stopped on the trail putting on more layers. So, I waited some more and another hiker came and I asked him, and he said he thought Earl Grey was behind him as well. Then Ulysses came up, and I realized the other hiker thought Ulysses was Earl Grey. Ulysses said he had not seen Earl Grey, and now I started to wonder if somehow he had gotten ahead of me. I wasn't sure if I should wait, or move on. I started to head down the trail, but then thought I should continue to wait. Then along came Flo-bo and Sha Ling and they said they had not passed by Earl Grey. So, I tried calling and it went right to his voicemail. I chatted with Flo-bo and Sha Ling and then my phone showed that I had a couple of voicemails. As I was trying to receive the voicemails a call came in from Earl Grey telling me he had gone past the tower and was down the Mountain a mile or so. Just as I started to hike on the sun broke through and I got a nice view from the summit, so I said to Flo-bo ""well, at least I got a view"", and headed quickly down the trail. Eventually I met Earl Grey quickly coming back up to meet me. He took my pack so I could hike a little faster and we hiked back to where he left his pack and continued on the trail. From now on I will leave my poles at the trail if I take a side trip so he will know to stop and wait/find me! 
After that experience we headed on without incident for the rest of the day. As we hoped, the weather was clearing and was now just partly cloudy with a good wind. We were heading for Max Patch with one of the best views on the trail and were hoping to spend the night on the summit to see the sunset and sunrise. As we neared the summit the weather was now clear, but the miles and elevation were starting to add up and we were slowing down. We stocked up on water and climbed to the top. The views did not disappoint, but it was cold and the wind was fierce. No way could we comfortably stay the night on top. 
We headed down the trail for some relief from the brutal wind. Once we found a decent spot we could tent, we realized we were so close to the shelter that we stumbled on a little more and found a packed shelter. Actually the shelter only had a few hikers in it, but someone counted 18 tents around it. We did find a pretty good spot to tent. A running joke we have had pertains to a hiker early on that said ""I have to be careful or I'll accidentally do a 15 mile day"", kind of bragging about how they can easily do that, but they are holding themselves back. We have often used that line jokingly, but for today we did accidentally do our first 15 mile day, so that milestone is now in the books. Looking to be another cold night (go figure), so into our sleeping bags we go!","Standing Bear Hostel

Cold last night, but both of us slept surprisingly well, probably the miles we did yesterday. Note to self, no more out of date ""whole grain"" Pop-tarts for breakfast, we could barely choke them down. Not sure how you get a ""whole grain"" Pop-tart, but that is what they say. 
The plan today was to get within 4 - 6 miles of Hot Springs so we would have an easy day into town tomorrow. Nice start today, unlike most days, with a long, gentle downhill to nearly flat trail. Soon though we got warmed up with the climb up over Walnut Mountain. Nice grassy area near the top where we rested and ate a few snacks. Steep down into the gap only to start a longer climb up to the top of Bluff Mountain. We took our time today knowing we didn't have to be anywhere in particular. Now that we are out of the Smoky Mountains we can camp wherever we want. 
Had lunch near the top and finally made it down the long downhill to a sunny gap. Mary's knees and feet were very sore, so we took our packs and shoes and socks off and lay in the sun for 40 minutes or so. Felt better once we got going again and planned to stop at the next gap with Tank and Tagalong. By the time we checked the map again we realized we had been through the gap and had done the majority of the final climb. We decided to just eat dinner beside the trail at a small campsite and then just move on to the next shelter which was also the next spot for water, which we needed. So we cooked instant potato and summer sausage mixed with Lipton cup of soup at the campsite near the ridge and then hiked down to the shelter. This only leaves us 3.2 miles into town tomorrow, so we will skip the Pop-tarts and eat at the Smoky Mountain Diner instead! I've waited 7 long years to get back there for their skillet breakfast. Pretty nice shelter with good tenting. Tank and Tagalong didn't like the camping at the gap area and are here along with Beach Bum and Irish, Jake (formally ""Cool Guy""), and a few other hikers. On a side note, thanks to ""Bags"" and her trail magic, whenever Mary and I are having a tough time we call out Bagheera!, like in Jungle Book, in hopes that she will appear to brighten our day again. Off to bed dreaming of food and a shower tomorrow. 
We've seen May Flowers along the trail I believe in all the states so far. There are lots of small wildflowers starting to bloom along the trail, including Trillium in several colors. When we hike in areas with Spruce trees the smell reminds us of home.
Mary here: On another note, Alan & I are working on a little AT song as we hike along the trail. It is sung to the tune of the Pina Colada song, and goes like this:

Last night in camp we had ""Tank"", ""Tagalong"", ""Irish"", ""Beach Bum"", Mark, Jake, and a couple other hikers. In addition there was a section hiker (a teacher from North Carolina) who kept us all entertained with stories around the campfire. We stayed up a little later than normal, even though we planned to try to get an early start so we can enjoy breakfast in town at the Smoky Mountain Diner. I've waited 7 long years to come back for their skillet breakfast, and we both mentioned to most of the hikers staying there that the Smoky Mountain Diner was the place to get breakfast.
We got up early and picked up quickly. I managed to get down a stale Pop-tart, but Mary had no desire for one more stale Pop-tart and just started hiking toward town. As we were hiking down the trail ""Tagalong"" and ""Tank"" came up behind us and said that Mary should be called ""Purple Haze"", so she has decided to accept that as her trail name. Ironically, when we got to town we noticed that the coffee shop where our son Kyle works has a beverage called ""Purple Haze"", so that sealed the deal.
As we arrived at Hot Springs we met ""Papa Dale"", ""Kingsman"", and ""Tobasco"" who were already in Hot Springs. We headed right for the diner, unfortunately we should have stopped at the Laughing Heart Lodge/Hostel, but we had heard they were full. We both enjoyed an awesome skillet breakfast along with hot tea. ""Tagalong"" and ""Tank"" joined us at our table.
Once we finished breakfast we decided we better find a place to stay for the night. We had heard that Elmer's Hostel was also full, and headed for the Alpine Court (where I stayed in 2011). We had tried calling the Alpine Court on the trail, but got a message that they were ""out of the office"" and to call the number that we had already tried that was no longer in service. When we got to the Alpine Court we could see the reason why we could not get anyone on the phone, it is closed down. 
After trying various places, we ended up with a nice room at the Belle Inn. We couldn't check in until 3:00 so we went to the library to work on our journal. We also checked out the laundromat which was filthy, and had a couple washers, and no working dryer. We were able to get our laundry done at the Laughing Heart Hostel, but had to wait on a list for several hours. We were hoping to eat at the tavern on the river, however the only tables available were on the porch, and it was raining. It was covered, but had a leak near where the only available seating was. Plus, smoking was allowed on the porch, and it was too much for us. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner further down the road at the Iron Horse Station, as well as a couple local beers. 
Met a couple of hikers trying to find Elmers, and we told them the hostel was full. They asked about the Inn and we told them we thought there was a room available. They also spent the night at the inn, they are from Germany, ""Flying Snail"" and ""Quarter"".","Deer Park Mountain Shelter

We had planned on another breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner, but since a continental breakfast was included with our stay we decided to enjoy breakfast at the Inn. ""Flying Snail"" and ""Quarter"" were at the table for breakfast as was a couple from South Carolina enjoying a night away from home. We had organic yogurt, granola, fresh fruit and muffins. We both also enjoyed a cup of hot tea. We enjoyed talking to ""Flying Snail"" and ""Quarter"" about their hiking experience so far, and told them at the rate they are going they should have no trouble finishing by early September. Hopefully we will see them again down the trail, they are heading back out on the trail today. We headed down to the diner after breakfast hoping to catch up with Bubbs, no luck. Hoping to see him around town before we head back to the trail.
We went to the library again to work on the journal, and also checked out the local outfitter. Did our resupply at the Dollar General and outfitters for a 5 day stint to Erwin. Had lunch at the diner where we saw ""Pappy"" and Steve. ""Pappy"" ordered a pizza and said he was planning on eating the whole thing. Mary wasn't feeling well so she took a nap in the room after lunch. Had dinner again at the Iron Horse, Mary only felt up to soup and a baked potato. I had a chicken sandwich with fries and a beer as my brother in law Ric informed me it was National Beer Day.
I went up to the Hot Spring to see if we could enjoy a soak in the springs, unfortunately there are no tubs available until later in the day tomorrow.
We called our oldest son Nathan to wish him a Happy Birthday, we had called him earlier, but he was enjoying lunch at TGI Friday's with his family.

We were not sure if we were going to have breakfast at the Inn or go to the diner. We came down and Mary saw orange juice and that made the decision for her, breakfast at the Inn. We had granola with milk or yogurt, cinnamon buns, croissants, fresh fruit, orange juice, and hot tea. It was just us at the breakfast table as the father and sons staying the night wanted their breakfast at 6:00 and the innkeeper obliged them. We were lucky we decided to have breakfast at the Inn because when we walked to the diner to see if ""Bubbs"" or any of the other hikers were there we saw that the diner is closed on Sunday.
 Cold day out, but not raining. There is snow on the mountain tops. It was a tough climb up to Lover's Leap, and the higher we climbed the more snow we saw. Logan passed us on the trail, and then we met him again enjoying his lunch by a dammed pond. We decided to stop at the pond for a snack. Also saw Jake hiking out today.
When we got to the trail for the Rich Mountain Firetower we decided we might as well check it out. The tower is missing a few steps and the railing is rickety in spots. Originally Mary wasn't going to climb the tower, but she changed her mind. The views from the top of the tower were worth the trip up the sketchy steps. Took some photos from the top, lots of snow on the surrounding mountain tops.
Made it to Spring Mountain Shelter where there are lots of other hikers tenting tonight. We are camped up on the hill on a reasonably flat spot. Very wet and muddy and of course cold! Quick dinner and off to bed to try to stay warm and dry before the rain comes.
In 2011 I really enjoyed Hot Springs, and Mary was looking forward to a visit to town. This year I certainly wasn't as fond of my stay as there are more hikers than there are rooms to stay and the advertised laundromat is run down and has no dryer. Of course the Smoky Mountain Diner was as good as I remembered, and the Iron Horse also had good food and beer.","Hot Springs

Awoke to rain and dense fog, which made it tough to get going. The campsite was literally in a cloud and made everything damp/wet. Heated water for tea and had breakfast in the tent and then mustered the gumption to get going. Our toes and fingers were frozen. Fortunately the trail eased us into the hike today with a long series of downhills into Allen Gap. We finally warmed up, but it was a dreary day. 
Started the long climb up Camp Creek Bald, once we arrived at the top we were pretty beat after slogging through mud all day. Problem is, once we reached that point we still had to make it over White Rock & Black Stack Cliff, plus Fire Scald Knob which is a rocky, strenuous section that actually has a bypass for bad weather. We pushed on, getting a couple of views as the fog had lifted some. Because we were up over 4,500' snow from the past snowstorm was still on the ground. This made the rocky ridge slow going. (""Purple Haze"" does not like slippery rocks). Made it up and over as it was getting darker and colder. 
We finally staggered into camp after 8:30 pm thanks to a final push by Mary. Lots of tents tonight. Set up and ate by headlight. When I went to get water the fog was so thick I could hardly see the trail to the spring. I actually walked right by the campsite coming back and only noticed Mary's headlamp after I was well past our site. 
It was a cold night and Mary couldn't seem to warm up, so I heated water for her Camelback bottle and she put that near her feet. On the plus side, today we passed the 300 mile mark and did our longest day yet. Plan is for another 15+ tomorrow, but I'm not sure we are up for it.","Spring Mountain Shelter

The thickest fog I've ever seen had completely cleared by 2:00 am, but the temperature dropped. Everything we had was set up damp last night and we had trouble staying warm. Got up, put on all of our stuff and got moving as fast as we could. Both of us were tired from the long day yesterday, of course we had a climb up to the top of Big Butt Mountain (you are welcome to insert various jokes here due to the name) right off the bat to 4,800'. After a tough couple of days the plan wasn't necessarily to make our planned mileage, but to find a sunny spot to sit and dry out our gear. We stopped at Flint Gap and had lunch and dried all of our gear. Had our tent set up to dry upside down when a little ""twister"" came out of nowhere and swept the tent up sending it 30 - 40 feet in the air and then back up the hill we had hiked down. I managed to run up the hill and grab the tent before it went any further. 
After crossing Rector Laurel Road and reentering the trail we were both listening to music when all of a sudden I saw Mary jump like she had been startled. She listens to her music at a lower volume and had heard two dogs barking behind us. We turned to see the dogs, but fortunately they did not seem to want to cross the small bridge over the stream to get any closer to us. 
It was an extremely steep climb from the road following a pretty stream. We thought it was fitting that we stopped to soak our feet at the bottom of a small waterfall on Mary's sister Lorraine's birthday. Lorraine loves waterfalls. The original plan was to camp at Big Flat campsites, however we didn't find any sites that looked great so we moved on. Reached Hogback Ridge Shelter late and found some hikers enjoying a nice fire that had been built inside a hollow log standing on end. We were told there was room in the shelter, but we opted to tent finding a nearby site that was semi-flat. Second longest day mileage wise, and we hadn't planned on it being such a long day. On the plus side we got everything dried out, and we actually ate dinner on the side of the trail so we didn't have to cook so late at night this time.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Got a late start this morning, we were almost the last out of camp with the exception of Knotty Boy and another hiker. I had cereal for breakfast and Mary had a Pop-tart and our tummies were grumbling after about 2 miles on the trail. 
As we were hiking Knotty Boy and the other hiker passed us and I jokingly said that if there was trail magic at Sam's Gap they better save us some. Knotty Boy said ""don't worry we will, that would be ironic because my name is Sam. My Gap, so I'll let you have some trail magic"". 
As we approached Sam's Gap we saw a truck parked up the hill, but just assumed it was hikers coming back to the trail. However, as we neared the road we saw a small sign stating there was trail magic up the hill, and then I remembered, this is where I got trail magic from ""Quiet Paul"" back in 2011. Low and behold as we walked up the hill there was ""Quiet Paul"" serving scrambled eggs, hashbrown potatoes, along with oranges, cookies, and soda. We each grabbed a Barqs Rootbeer and grabbed a chair as ""Quiet Paul"" scrambled us up some eggs. Chatted with ""Quiet Paul"" and he said he has been doing trail magic in the area for eight years. I mentioned I had enjoyed his trail magic back in 2011 which he mentioned is the year he got kicked out of the state land and had to move up near the cemetery which is private, and he has permission to continue his tradition there. He said he does trail magic here for 10 days during the ""hiker bubble"". So happy we managed to hit a day he was there, what a great treat to enjoy a hot breakfast at a point we really needed it.
A long, semi steep climb up to Big Bald Mountain. Once we reached the summit we decided to find a less windy spot on the side to sit, take our shoes off and enjoy the sunny day. We spent about a half hour enjoying the warmth of the sun and then decided we better move on. Headed down toward Whistling Gap Campsite, but not before going over Little Bald (which isn't all that little). Mary had texted her sister April earlier in the day to wish her a Happy Birthday, but we decided to see if we could get a call out to her at this point as well. Managed to get cell service long enough to wish her a Happy Birthday and find out that they will meet us in Erwin on Friday for lunch. We also managed to get a call out to the Super 8 where we will be staying the night on Thursday. 
Not many hikers at the campsite tonight, just ""Bobo"" & ""Animal"". Most of the other hikers went on to No Business Knob Shelter which is another 7 miles, or possibly some made it all the way to Erwin. 
Hanging our bearbag and off to bed with thoughts of town tomorrow. Won't be a short day though, Erwin is still 13.3 miles away. Hopefully Mary is up for another long day of hiking.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Got up before light at around 6:00 to get packed and going. Even though we are heading into town it isn't a short day, and we want as much time in town to get stuff done since we won't zero there. Cereal, Pop-tarts and tea and we were off to climb up to a spot they call High Rock, a steep, rocky summit with great views. The sun was just peeking over the mountains as we approached the rocky summit. Soon we were down to Spivey Gap and then started the climb up along the Oglesby Branch Stream. Once we reached the top we started a long descent out of the mountains into town. About 9 miles of mostly down with a few short ups to get to an adjoining ridge. 
The day warmed quickly and by lunch at No Business Knob shelter we had stripped down to shorts/skirt and t-shirts. The long sustained downs are tough on our knees, but we made good time and took few breaks. When you first see Erwin until you actually arrive is a long time as it is a series of switchbacks that seem to go on forever before you finally arrive. Grabbed a quick Ice Cream novelty and Gatorade at Uncle Johnny's when we arrived as we were really sweating in the hottest weather we've had yet. Uncle Johnny's shuttled us over to the Super 8 where we got cleaned up and did laundry. ""Jack Rabbit"" had told us about a burger joint called Pal's just down the road that had great burgers and milkshakes, so as soon as we were cleaned up we headed out to find it. Several other hikers had got their order placed and were at a nearby picnic table enjoying their food. We walked up to the drive thru window and placed our order and were told to back up and wait and they would let us know when it was ready. With food in hand we headed to the picnic table to join the others. They were a good-natured group (Jo, Two, Hemlock, Jack Rabbit, Sandals & Ninja Snail), and they are all zeroing tomorrow and were enjoying some burgers and milkshakes before heading to the movie theater to see Ready Player One. They invited us to join them at the movies, but we declined as we wanted to rest as we will meet Mary's sister April and brother-in-law Phil tomorrow and then head back to the trail later in the day. The food was great and certainly hit the spot. 
Back at the room we worked on catching up on journal entries and tried to figure out the next resupply spot for the upcoming leg of the hike. I'm having a little trouble planning because they are predicting heavy rain and then another round of cold Saturday night, Sunday, and into Monday. This is when we'll be heading up Roan Mountain and into the Humps. Roan is 6,200' and the series of balds are all over 5,000'. The high elevation will likely mean we will have some snow to deal with. One, we have had enough of the snow and cold, and two this was one of my favorite areas of the trail in 2011 and I would like to go over in good weather. I guess we will get close and there are a couple of bail out options if things don't look good. I like having things all planned out, but I guess we will just have to be flexible. Well, off to bed...
Note from Mary: The mention of the cold, rain, snow etc reminds me of a little diddy we've made up to the tune of 9-5...

Kind of a luxury today to sleep in, get up and shower, go down to the hotel breakfast for waffles, cereal, juice, tea, and bagels. Back at the room after breakfast we packed up all of our gear and got ready for check out. Got word from April and Phil that they would be here at 11:20. Check out is at 11:00, so we worked on our journal entries as we chatted with several other hikers who were facing the same dilemma as us regarding the upcoming weather and terrain. 
Soon April + Phil arrived and we checked out and headed for the Food Lion for resupply. Great lunch with April & Phil at the Azteca restaurant which also came highly recommended by ""Hemlock"" and ""Jack Rabbit"" back at the Super 8. Mary and I both had the Quesadilla Grande lunch specials which we devoured along with our fair share of salsa and chips. We both also enjoyed a large, unsweetened ice tea. There was a Dollar General next door to the restaurant where I was able to pick up my Spam singles, which the Food Lion was out of. People like to make fun of Spam, but it packs quite a few calories into a compact package and is really quite good tasting to me, at least for now. (One hiker joked that 37 different species of animals gave their lives for Spam). 
After lunch we made our way back to the trail. I picked up a few last minute things at Uncle Johnny's. April & Phil drove our packs over the bridge and we met them on the other side. Phil walked Brody and let him cool off in the river while April helped us field strip our resupply. April & Phil gave us a couple snacks for the trail, most notably a Milky Way dark for Mary and an almond Snickers for me. We said our good byes and we were back in the woods. It was nice to have a visit with family, our second visit on the trail. Very hot today and we suffered as we headed uphill with our food laden packs. We got so much food that Mary has a food bag, and mine was so full that it didn't all fit in my pack so I have some strapped to the outside of my pack in a Dollar General bag. Of course we realized later that the heat made our snickers just about liquid and the Oreo cookies and Little Debbie Fudge Rounds and Oatmeal Creams kind of became blobs. They will re-harden later, you just have to be careful not to poke at them too much when they are in their softened state. 
We didn't leave town until nearly 2:00, so after a long climb out of town in the heat we arrived at Curly Maple Gap Shelter around 5:00. We decided to push on another 4 miles to Indian Grave Gap to get a good day in after a late start. By the time we arrived we were ready to be done for the day as we were tired of carrying our way too heavy packs. Found a nice, leafy spot and quickly set up our tent and ate, making sure we selected some of the heaviest items for dinner tonight. It's a novelty to be in camp and not be freezing as we eat and get ready for bed. Hung our bear bag and headed to bed. Only one other camper here with us tonight (""Fraggle""),  he is set up just down the hill a little and is enjoying a campfire. 
Note from Mary: April and Phil were enjoying a trip south so that April could finish her ""Fifty States by Fifty"". They spent April's birthday in Louisiana, and also enjoyed a night in Chattanooga, TN  in a Chattanooga Choo Choo train car.
Another Note from Mary: Alan didn't mention in the above journal that before reaching Curly Gap Shelter he had to get some water from the stream so I could cool down as I sat beside the trail. I soaked one of our small towels in the water and put it on my face and neck to cool down. The heat really got to me as we are not used to hot weather on the trail. It went from winter cold to summer hot with no simply warm spring temperatures.","Erwin

15.9 miles on the trail, plus another .6 to the hostel
Good start to the day, everything is still dry and it is cool but not cold. It was nice to enjoy tea and breakfast and not feel like we were freezing. First order of business today is to finish the climb we started last night to Beauty Spot and then continue climbing up Unaka Mountain. Our packs are still full and quite heavy, but by the time we made it to Beauty Spot the sun was fully out and it was quite breezy, so we had really nice views. Once again we look in the distance near the parking lot ahead and who do we see but ""Papa Dale"", ""Kingsman"", and ""Tobasco"". They had gotten a shuttle and were going to head south back toward town. We gave them my usual greeting ""Hey, you guys are going the wrong way."" We chatted with them for a short while about each others plans and the weather and then we headed our separate ways. When we finally reached Unaka Mountain it was getting quite warm, we stopped at a spruce tree near the top decorated sort of like a Christmas/Easter tree in honor of Max. Max's parents decorate the tree in memory of their son who lost his life. We took a moment to pay our respects and sign the log book. We started down the switchbacks getting hungry for lunch, but just couldn't seem to find a suitable place to stop. About 1:00 we could wait no longer and just found a downed tree not too far off the trail and took off our packs and sat on the tree for lunch. By this point we were already quite tired and still stressing over where to stay and how to avoid the upcoming weather. We were on Little Bald Knob when we were passed by ""Jo"" and ""Two"" who were slack packing from Erwin to Greasy Creek Hostel. ""Jo"" was quite happy because here knees were hurting less with no pack even though they were doing a 25 mile day. They mentioned that tomorrow they were going to slackpack south from Carvers Gap back to the hostel again. Once they left it got us thinking that maybe their plan was a good way to get some mileage in, but still be out of the weather at night. 
Tomorrow it is supposed to rain heavy and then on Monday it is supposed to get cold and possibly snow. Even though it was getting late we decided to push farther than we planned and try to make it to the hostel tonight. About 30 minutes later as we were coming up the final little rise into Iron Mountain Gap road I hear Mary say ""I smell burgers cooking"". Shortly after I began to smell it also. I nearly knocked Mary over as I pushed passed to see where the smell was coming from. Sure enough, at the gap I see a pop-up canopy with a small group of hikers and a couple of guys saying ""hikers? come on over"". Trail magic! Mary and I quickly went over to find a couple of last years hikers and their friend cooking hot dogs and burgers. They also had coolers with soda and beer.  ""Lookout"" and ""Crusher"" hiked last year and their friend ""Clincher"" is with them and plans to hike with them after they finish with the trail magic. ""Jo"" and ""Two"" were there with a couple of other German hikers. Once again, just when we needed it most at the end of a tough day, we received what we needed. We each had a cheeseburger and soda. We just made it because as we left they were picking up. They plan to hike the same section we are going to do tomorrow and plan to pack out the remaining soda and beer to give out to hikers they meet along the trail. Trail magic was just the lift we needed to make the final 4+ miles to the hostel. 
When we made it to the gap where the trail to the hostel is we had some difficulty finding the trail down to the hostel. When we did find what we hoped was the trail we started down an old road that was washed out and rocky. It was a steep downhill over 1/2 mile, so we really hoped we were on the right path. It was the correct trail, but when we arrived the owner was out, so the other hikers filled us in on the rules and what we needed to do. We got our showers, but didn't need dinner thanks to the trail magic. We waited for the owner to return, but it got late so we just grabbed a bunk in the bunkhouse and went to sleep. Our plan is to try to share a shuttle with ""Jo"" and ""Two"" up to Carvers Gap, which is just north of Roan Mountain, and hike back to the hostel in the bad weather and then try to get a ride back to Erwin where we will zero on Monday and wait out the cold and snow. If it works, we will get some good miles and still avoid the worst conditions and be able to go over the beautiful balds on a good day.","Indian Grave Gap

Actually did this part of the trail southbound (Carvers Gap to Greasy Creek Hostel).
Up pretty early today to see if we can arrange things for a slackpack today. I'm glad we were in the bunkhouse last night as the wind blew strong all night and I heard a couple of bouts of rain on the metal roof. Just started to sprinkle steady as we went in for a cup of hot tea and breakfast. Met the owner, Connie, who said it shouldn't be a problem to add two more to the shuttle to Carvers Gap. Packed up Mary's pack with just the essentials for today's hike. Just hats, gloves, buffs, down jackets, lunch, snacks, and water. I'll hike with Mary's pack today, and she will be pack free. 
We stowed the rest of our stuff and donned our rain coats and rain pants. Soon Connie's neighbor, Erica, arrived to bring ""Jo"", ""Two"", Mary & I up to Carvers Gap for the 13.8 mile hike back. When we arrived at the gap it was foggy, windy, and there was a steady rain. It felt strange not to be hiking with our heavy packs, and we made really good time by ""Earl Grey"" and ""Purple Haze"" standards. The trail was a river, and the rain and wind were howling, so the rain gear kept us warm but not totally dry. We were quickly to the top of Roan Mountain and visited the shelter which is the highest shelter on the AT. Signed the log book and checked out who else had stopped in. Brand new log book at the shelter, so only a couple of entries. Got a couple of pictures and headed back down the trail. 
Took a quick peek at the site of the old hotel when we reached that little trail and continued on. Conditions were really dreadful, but knowing we were going to end up warm and dry made them tolerable. We felt bad for the hikers we saw along the trail as we knew some were not going to really get out of the weather and would be spending time in their damp tents or wet shelters. It was kind of fun going southbound as we got to pass by hikers that are just ahead of us. We met ""Wicked"", ""Waterboy"", ""Knotty Boy"", and ""Sourpatch"" as well as the group that provided trail magic yesterday. 
Mary was flying today with no pack, at times I was having trouble staying with her on the downhills even though I had a tiny pack today. We were soaked to the bone when we made it back to the hostel around 3:30, but happy to have made such good progress on such a miserable day. We stood around quite damp for a while but eventually 10 of us piled into Connie's Suburban and headed toward Erwin to either be dropped off or to get food. ""Jo"" and ""Two"" had decided to come back to Erwin also, rather than zero at the hostel. We were glad to be back at the Super 8 where we can spread out a little and get dry. 
Two other little bits of trail magic today: 1. when we checked in our room I went to put my water in the fridge and I found an unopened bottle of wine. That means we'll have wine with our take out pizza tonight. 2. when we arrived we needed a couple of items to do our laundry, so I decided to brave the rain again in shorts and a rain coat to run down to Walgreens about 1/2 mile away. I didn't want to get my hiking pants wet, and my rain pants were soaked so I figured I'd just tough it out in my shorts. I didn't get more than 100 yards when a white suburban stopped and said ""where are you going""? When I told them they said hop in and we'll take you. Turns out it was section hikers ""Smurf"" and ""Cub"". They are also staying at the Super 8 and are doing a 70 mile section that ""Cub"" has yet to hike. They brought me to Walgreens and waited for me to get my supplies and brought me back to the hotel right under the awning. Many thanks to them, hopefully we will see them on the trail. Dinner of pizza and wine, along with rest, icing of Mary's knees, Epsom Salt soak of Mary's feet, and redoing our laundry in Dr Bronners and white vinegar to get out the nasty Tide Sport Pod residue that is making Mary break out in a rash. Tomorrow should bring more rest and hopefully we will catch up on the rest of the journal.","Greasy Creek Gap (Hostel)

Talked to ""Jo"" and ""Two"" this morning, and we will split a shuttle with them tomorrow to get back on trail at Carvers Gap. They lined up a shuttle for 7:30 am. Lots of hikers in town to get out of the weather, many at breakfast today. Saw ""Papa Dale"", ""Kingsman"" and ""Tobasco"" getting ready to head back out. Logan is in town, plus many others that have just arrived in Erwin that are a couple of days behind us on the trail. We don't know many of the names because we haven't hiked with them yet. Continental breakfast was a zoo this morning with some hikers staying and some heading back out. Not snowing in Erwin, but a light, cold rain. Not sure what the weather is in the mountains, but we are happy we are warm and dry here today. When we arrived yesterday we saw ""Stray Cat"", who we haven't seen since Franklin. Guess he was off trail for a week plus for personal reasons. Walked to the local library to get caught up on the journal.
May need to add more to this entry later, need to log off and get some lunch!
Went to Los Jalapenos for dinner. We enjoyed Margaritas and I had a combo plate, Mary had Fajitas Nachos. We both ate way too much.
Note: Noticed our mileage is off by 1.4, not sure where we messed it up. Will have to review each days mileage when we get a chance to try to find the error. If anyone knows where we messed up, or finds any other blatant errors, please feel free to let us know. Thank you to all who are following along on our journey via our journal.

Mary here: Erwin is starting to feel like a second home. Alan is off to get a hair cut, and I'm at thelibrary. Shuttle driver said he might not be able to get us all the way back to the trail today due to ice/snow on the road to Carvers Gap. So, we will head out tomorrow...
Computers at the library work much better than at the hotel, but it is a walk to get here. (When in town we like to rest our legs, but actually we were looking forward to being back on the trail today).
May update this entry again later today. Hope to fix our photos we tried uploading at the hotel computer.","Erwin

Finally leaving Erwin (for the second time), our shuttle arrived promptly at 8:00 am. We headed back to Carvers Gap with Jo & Two. It was a clear and sunny day when we arrived, but a little cool to start. Headed up over Round, and Jane Bald enjoying the views every step of the way. Still a little remaining snow, but for the most part it was clear but still wet and muddy in places.
As we neared the top we stripped down as we heated up. We put sunscreen on our faces as we would be exposed pretty much all day. After two days off we were a little sluggish climbing up to almost 6,000 feet.
We made it into the Overmountain shelter for lunch with Kingsman, Papa Dale and Tabasco. They also returned to the trail at Carvers Gap this morning. Enjoyed an extended lunch in the sun enjoying the view, but then had to make the climb up the balds. 
It was so warm after lunch that we were down to shorts/skirt and tee shirts. The Humps were beautiful, but the climb took its toll in the heat. Taylor and Katherine caught up to us as we were taking a break from the heat at the top and joined us for a bit. Soon we headed back down the trail heading for the road as we wanted to go into the Smoky Mountain Bakery for pizza tonight. Unfortunately, after a tough downhill which really bothered Mary's knees we came to the Tennessee/North Carolina border and thought we had only .7 miles to go (based on the AWOL Guide). Really, we had on the order of 3 more miles to go. The guidebook we have is inaccurate somewhere in this section of the trail.
We struggled to make the final miles to the road, and rather than hitch we opted to go to  Mountain Harbour Hostel which was just .3 miles down the road where we hoped we could get a ride to the bakery. We asked about getting a ride, but we were told that since there was just the two people working we wouldn't be able to get a ride but could probably get a quick ride by hitchhiking. So, since we were bound and determined to have pizza (Alan still remembers how good the pizza was back in 2011) we decided to try to hitchhike. It took a while, but just as we were about to give up a car pulled over. It was a pretty beat up car, with a broken windshield, but the two guys who just got off work were willing to drive us to the bakery. 
After enjoying amazing pizza, and grabbing a couple red velvet cream filled cookies, we headed back to the road to try to get a hitch back to the hostel. The road didn't have any shoulder, so we decided we better cross over to the Dollar General and try to find a ride. After asking several people ""Are you heading back toward the hostel"", and being told no only to watch them go that way, a woman who originally said no rolled down the window once her husband was back in the minivan and said ""get in"". They were very nice, and live basically right across from the hostel and drove us back. We offered to give them some money, but they said no.
Back at the hostel we set up our tent and enjoyed a hot shower. We put our food bags in the building for the night (along with the leftover slices of pizza we will enjoy for lunch tomorrow) and headed to bed. Papa Dale, Kingsman, and Tabasco are staying at the hostel. Jo and Two are tenting here as are some other hikers we have not met.","Carvers Gap

Woke up, it had rained a little during the night but had stopped enough that we packed up quickly and went into the hostel where we ate with Papa Dale, Kingsman, Tabasco, Jo & Two. The hostel was nice as it had a coffee machine with hot water on the side. We were able to make tea and oatmeal without using our stove to boil water.
Jo & Two are slack packing today 24 miles, so it's doubtful we will see them again. We were the last ones to leave today, but we did have some cold pizza to pack out for lunch. Good, rolling terrain through mostly rhododendron this morning. Came to Jones Falls early and took the side trail to get up close, a very spectacular water fall.
Soon after the falls we crossed the 400 mile mark of the trail. We crossed by another nice waterfall, Mountaineer Falls, and then enjoyed our leftover pizza at the Mountaineer shelter. Lots of little ups and downs today.
Later in the afternoon we came across a group of trail maintainers hiking back out after a day of working on the trails. I recognized one of them as Bob Peoples, and we stopped and had a nice chat with him and some of the crew. One of the workers was a thru-hiker we had met earlier (Deluxe) who decided to help them out for the day. We had planned to stay at Bob Peoples hostel tomorrow, but I don't think the timing will work as we will arrive at lunch, so we were glad to see him today. Bob is such a local legend when it comes to trail work, it was great to hear some of his stories.
We soon came across a park bench with a nice vista so we stopped for a break and were soon joined by Katherine and Taylor for a short time. We were heading for a marked campsite when we came upon Papa Dale, Kingsman, & Tabasco who invited us to squeeze in near their tents, but it was a little tight so we pushed on about .7 miles more to the marked site which was larger. 
We are here all by ourselves tonight on a nice, leafy, soft site. Funny thing about these less used campsites, we stumble along kicking rocks all day long, but when you get to camp you can't find a suitable rock to put in the pouch to throw the bear bag. Big day, so off to bed.","US 19E

Got up early and had Poptarts and got going as, you guessed it, it was cold this morning. Tent stakes were frozen in and the tent poles were all frost, which means our fingers got very cold. We hiked ourselves warm and when we made it the 1 1/2 miles to Moreland Gap Shelter we stopped for a cup of tea. We soon heard Papa Dale, Kingsman, & Tabasco (we call them the 3 Amigos) chatting as they came down the switchbacks toward the shelter. They stopped for a quick visit and we exchanged plans for the day and they were off.
Around lunch time we arrived at Dennis Cove Road to see the 3 Amigos eating lunch. They had run up to Bob Peoples Hostel to try to grab a soda, but he wasn't there. We needed a few things for resupply, so we ditched our packs in the woods and headed in the other direction to the Black Bear Resort. There we were able to get the things we needed even if they were overpriced. The best part was we were able to cook a pizza for lunch and have a bag of Fritos while we waited. Mary and I split a local brew with our pizza and topped everything off with ice cream sandwiches for dessert all while sitting on their deck looking out over the river. Reluctantly we headed back down to get our packs and continue on our way. A dog followed us all the way back to where we left our packs, but thankfully then it headed back the other way and didn't follow us down the trail.
As the day warmed up we made our way down to Laurel Falls. A very impressive waterfall with a beautiful river running. Our feet were aching so bad we couldn't help but stop and soak for about 15 minutes. The water was so cold it numbed our feet after about 1 minute. We would put our feet in and soak them and lift them back out to regain feeling. It really does make your feet feel better once you get going again. Mary also dipped her bandanna in to put across here knees to cool them down as well.
We soon passed a spot on the trail where you hike between the fast moving river on one side and a rock face on the other. It's a short section of trail that is only about 3 to 4 feet wide and a little intimidating, but we made it without incident. Shortly after, Mary decided to change from her long sleeve into her short sleeve. Thinking all the hikers were ahead of us, she stopped in the trail. Mid change a male hiker came around the corner saying, Whoa, I'll wait back here... Mary gave him the it's ok now, and he came up to tell us the story of him trying to change along the trail. He actually let an older woman know he was going up around the bend to change, hoping she would wait and give him time. He said he got around the corner and she hiked up fast to catch him changing. He said ""I don't know if she thought it was going to be a Chip and Dale show or what!""
Next we started the long, and I mean long, climb from the river up to Pond Mountain on a seemingly endless series of switchbacks. By the time we made it to the top Mary was exhausted and it was getting late. I suggested that maybe we should just camp up top at one of the many sites. She told me she was heading for the hostel 3 miles away. I glanced at my watch thinking that it might be dark when we made it and this might not be a good idea. Soon she put her music on and was off again moving so fast I could hardly keep up on the downhills. 
We made it down in good time with plenty of light. We were both tired and could hardly make it up the final climb (driveway) to the hostel, but when we did we were greeted by the 3 Amigos, Jo and Two, Katherine & Taylor, Sandals & Ninja Snail along with several others. They had two bunks left, which we took. Had a nice shower in their bucket shower and cooked dinner inside. The bunkhouse was full, but the bunks were comfortable and we were happy to have a few creature comforts after a long, tough day. The bunks each had curtains with separate lights. We were both on top bunks, and Mary was nervous about having to get back down in the middle of the night, but she didn't need to get down until morning, at which time I helped get her down safely...","Campsite before Moreland Gap Shelter

Started the day with a continental breakfast provided by the hostel (Cereal, donuts, and tea). Nice, easy walk to start around Watauga Lake. Soon passed over the dam and started the long climb up the ridge that parallels the lake. Again, at one point we came upon 3 dogs. They had collars, but you never know if the dogs you come upon will be friendly or not. They looked tired, and didn't bother us. There were a couple of women coming down the trail, and we warned them to watch for the dogs.
Climbed until well after lunch and the day got hotter and hotter. Very little water up on the ridge, and we skipped the last spring so we were out by the time we made it to a water source just prior to our campsite. We did have good views down to the lake from the ridge today, but it was a long, hot, tough day for us. 
Lots of tents at the shelter tonight. The 3 Amigos are here and we are camped next to a German hiker named Jorgen (Spirit) who has done 100 miles in the last 4 days. He plans on making Damascus tomorrow to double zero. Off to hang the bear bag and climb into the sleeping bag.","Boots Off Hostel

One of the last out of camp this morning, but we decided to push the pace today to see if we could get some good miles in early. The terrain was good today, no big ups or downs, so we managed to get 11.1 miles in today before lunch. (Note from Mary: The runner/cross country coach came out in Alan today and he ""coached"" me down the trail. I had a good pace going and he would comment ""ok, keep the pace on the uphill, rest on the down hill, don't hurry on the flats too much, save it for the next uphill"". It must have worked...)
Had lunch at Low Gap with Kingsman, Papa Dale, and a new hiker we have seen but not met before named ""Needles"". (She knits sometimes at camp). We were happy with our mileage this morning, but the pace did take a toll as the climb out of the gap had us struggling a bit. I stopped  for a bathroom break and came across a big, black snake in the woods. He was half again as long as my trekking pole. Even though I know they are not dangerous, they still startle you. I got a picture, though I'm not sure how good the picture will be.
Made it to Abingdon Gap Shelter for water. There was a group in the shelter that wan't all that cordial, but we hadn't planned on staying there anyway. We pushed on a couple more  miles to get closer to Damascus so we will be there fairly early tomorrow. Came across the 3 Amigos camping and decided to join them. Had a campfire while we ate dinner and a nice time chatting before we hit the hay. It may rain tonight, but we'll be in town tomorrow so we can dry out.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Note from Mary: Today we think we actually did around 8 miles. However, since we are not sure where the miles in AWOL are messed up, I put in 7.4 miles to get us to show 469.9 at Laurel and Shady in Damascus... 
Sprinkled a little during the night, but we were up early in a little lull to pack up in the dark. Had a miserable night as we both were so sweaty and slimy from the last days hiking that it was difficult to get comfortable in a clammy sleeping bag. We have to remember to try to clean up better after long, hot hiking days so we can sleep better. It's been tough to wash up good as it has been too cold by the time we get in to camp.
First out of camp with thoughts of beating the heavy rain into town. We soon crossed the TN/VA border so 3 states down and 11 to go. We will be in Virginia for some time though as it makes up around 1/4 of the trail. The 3 Amigos caught up to us just before town. 
As we started the final switchbacks into town it started to really rain. As we neared town Mary started complaining that the top of her left foot hurt and she must have her shoe tied too tight. She loosened it, but the pain worsened and she ended up limping into town. We wanted to eat at MOJO's, but it was raining so bad that we didn't want to walk clear across town. We checked with the outfitter for another breakfast place and he said the Damascus Diner had just opened today and it was around the corner. He had breakfast there and said it was quite good. We quickly made our way to the restaurant and got a table. Already there ready to order were Kingsman and Papa Dale. Tabasco had already headed to MOJO's not realizing there was a new diner.
After an amazing breakfast (except no hot tea, but it is their first day and they brought me a cup of hot water to put my own tea bag in at no charge.) we headed out to locate the Lazy Fox Inn. Ginny, the 93 year old woman who runs the Inn was not there. Not knowing for sure which room was ours, we set our stuff on the front porch. Jo and Two were at the Inn and gave us some information regarding our stay. 
Mary stayed on the porch to rest her foot and I headed out to find out about getting our laundry done as there is no longer a laundromat in town. I purchased some white vinegar and dye/scent free laundry pods. Crazy Larry at the local hostel said he'd do the laundry and the cost would be based on the load size and estimated probably around $9. I gave him the vinegar and pods and told him he could keep the rest of the pods (I kept a few to pack out for future laundry). He said he's had other hikers ask for laundry detergent for sensitive skin, so he might have to look into getting more for the future as well. When I came back later to get the laundry he only charged me $5 since I had given him the pods. Also picked up our package my sister sent from home with our lighter sleeping bags and my trail runners that I've used hiking at home.
Mary had dried out the tent fly while I was dropping off the laundry. I also managed to get the tip of one of her poles replaced after checking with the local outfitters, each twice. Ginny still wasn't back, but Mary went up to the shared bathroom to get a shower and eventually we put our stuff in the only downstairs room (she had told us we were downstairs). I got a shower so we could get ready for dinner.
We had thought about going to the Old Mill for dinner, but it was closed. So, we decided we would go back to the diner. Kingsman suggested getting a beer at MOJO's first (they close at 5 pm), so we headed there with him, Papa Dale, & Tabasco. There were a couple beers at MOJO's that peaked our interest, Mary selected a Stout and I picked out an IPA. At the diner Mary enjoyed a Santa Fe Salad and I had a delicious Philly Cheese Steak.
Back at the room we organized our resupply and got our package ready to send home. We are sending home our ""winter"" sleeping bags, base layers, and a few other items we don't think we will need. Off to bed...
Note from Mary: Forgot to mention that somewhere near Spring Mountain Shelter there is a mouse, chipmunk or other small animal that has a nice purple lined nest. I had a pack towel that I would air out on my trekking pole. Usually I just left it on the pole over night. One night I hung it in the vestibule, in the morning the little snap loop was hanging there with no towel. I shined my light outside and the towel was on the ground. I picked it up and it was full of holes.","Stealth Campsite

Woke up, and once it was after 7:00 am we went out for a cup of tea. Ginny & her helper, Joe, were busy preparing breakfast for everyone who had spent the night. As we waited for breakfast we sat in the living room area with Papa Dale, Kingsman & Tabasco watching an old western on TV. When breakfast was ready Joe rang the bell and we all headed to the table. Jorgen (Spirit), Ron (Donut), Doug (Two), Kristin (Jo), Dave (Kingsman) Dale (Papa Dale), James (Tabasco), Alan & I were all at the table which had an amazing spread of food all ready waiting. There was bacon, sausage, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, Cheese Grits, Pineapple Southern Baked, Baked Apple, Cinnamon buns, Biscuits and gravy, Apricots, Prunes, Pancakes, Fresh fruit (Kiwi, Strawberries, Cantaloupe, melon, and bananas), along with grape jelly, currant jelly, butter and syrup. We passed all the dishes around until everyone had what they wanted on their plates and Papa Dale said grace. Then, we all proceeded to eat the most amazing breakfast, the best we've had on the trail. They do this breakfast every morning no matter how many guests they have. I'm sure they adjust the amount they cook based on the number of guests. After breakfast Papa Dale mentioned to Alan that Ginny was fast asleep on the couch. She is 93 years old and gets up at 6:00 am to start cooking with Joe to have everything ready for the guests by 8:00 am, she is simply amazing!
We had to get to the post office to mail our ""winter"" gear back home. Asked at the post office if they had a box, but none big enough. So, we went to the outfitters, the only box they had was pretty big, but, we did pick out a couple post cards to send home to our grandsons Caiden & Kable. So, off to Dollar General where the nice lady working there found a box and emptied the contents so we could use it. Packed up our winter sleeping bags, base layers and a few other items we no longer need and sent the package and post card on their way. Now, it is time to get back on the trail.
As we headed down the trail out of town we came to a Subway. It was not quite lunch time, but Mary was already hungry even after the big breakfast we enjoyed. We each grabbed a foot long sub and ate half, packing up the other half to enjoy later. When we came out we put on our rain gear and pack covers and headed back to the trail.
As you head out of Damascus the AT follows the Creeper trail for .4 miles and then heads up going from just over 1900 feet to over 3300 feet paralleling the Creeper trail. With the mist/light rain the trail was slick and Alan almost fell when he slipped on a rock and started sliding toward the downhill side. Luckily he caught himself with his trekking poles. Eventually we did have some sun and we were able to remove our rain gear which makes hiking more enjoyable. 
We didn't see any other hikers on the trail until we arrived at Saunders Shelter. ""Spliff"" was stretching in the shelter when we arrived and said he was going to move on to the next shelter. Since we had gotten a late start out of Damascus and knew rain was expected we decided to stay at the shelter. We swept out the shelter and got all set up for the night, and enjoyed the rest of our subs. Alan hung the bear bag, and even though we expected other hikers might arrive to sleep at the shelter as well, we had the shelter to ourselves for the evening.
Note from Mary: I'm writing some of the entries. We are behind on our journal and for many days have just jotted down notes. When it's cold we don't get time to write as we head to the tent and into our warm bags. When it's warm we spend time chatting with other hikers and the journal has to wait. We hope to get caught up soon!","Damascus, VA (Lazy Fox B&B)

Up early and back on the trail. The day started out with fairly nice weather. We hiked back down the 4+ miles to where the AT rejoins the Creeper trail for .7 miles. As we hiked we saw a deer that seemed to be bounding up from the Creeper trail below. No other hikers on the trail, and we wonder where they all are. 
We stopped at Lost Mountain Shelter for lunch. Lost Mountain Shelter is at 3381 feet and the trail heads up to over 5100 feet. As we climbed the rocky wet trail the fog settled in and it started to get quite cold. As we neared Buzzard Rock we met a mother and daughter who are thru-hiking, ""Dirty Girl"" and ""Valkyrie"". They said they were heading to the campsite just after Whitetop Mtn Road and we said we hoped to make it to Elk Garden where we thought we could find a campsite for the night. It was so foggy at Buzzard Rock that we had no view and we trudged on after taking a few photos. Alan mentioned that when he came through this area in 2011 it was so hot that he, Mammoth, and Chainsaw stopped and took off their shirts to cool down and let their sweaty shirts dry out.
By the time we reached Elk Garden we were cold and tired and not looking forward to setting up camp, especially since we were right at VA 600. On the sign was a business card with the number for Grayson Highlands General Store. Our original plan was to go to the store tomorrow as the owner has a free shuttle from Massie Gap. We just planned to shuttle in for lunch and some resupply and showers and get back on the trail. But, we decided to call tonight and see if he would pick us up at Elk Garden. Cell phone service was poor, but after several tries, and just when I was about to give up, I got through. I asked if he had any rooms available and he said yes. I told him we were thru-hiking and asked if he would pick us up at Elk Garden. He said he didn't usually pick up there, but he certainly wouldn't leave us out in the cold for the night. He had to find someone to watch the store, but he'd be there in 30 minutes.
He drove us back to the store where we enjoyed pizza and beer. I hoped to call my mom to wish her a Happy Birthday, but there is no cell phone service here. We've been told there is not much service in this area. We enjoyed another beer in our room after first both getting hot showers. Then, since it was a Wednesday we decided to watch Survivor even though we've missed several weeks. Once Survivor ended we headed to bed, thankful to be in a warm bed instead of a cold, damp tent.","Saunders Shelter

Awoke glad we hadn't had to spend a foggy, wet night at Elk Garden. Packed our things and went down to the store to have a quick breakfast. The owner cooked us up a couple of bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches. We had to get a few items for resupply and were happy to find some dehydrated veggies that turned out to be really good. We got our items and he dropped us back at Elk Garden. 
The day was cool, but the sky was blue and bright. We started up through the meadow and got some beautiful views. Next was the long, rocky, sometimes wet climb up to Mt Rogers. It was a tough climb, but we were excited to hopefully see some ponies. We ate lunch at Thomas Knob Shelter where we ran into Tabasco who was having his lunch. He had decided to do a big day and moved on past Papa Dale and Kingsman. He did mention his arch was a little sore though.
Shortly after lunch as we headed for Grayson Highlands State Park we began to see some of the Mt Rogers ponies. We stopped to pet them whenever they were close by, and they seem quite tame. As a matter of fact, if you rustle a bag or dig into your pack looking for something they trot up to you hoping to get fed. 
The terrain is quite rocky and up and down, plus with all the stops for ponies and pictures we didn't make great time. The day was starting to cloud up and it was starting to look like the rain that is in the forecast is coming. We still hadn't seen many hikers, and with the exception of Tabasco, no familiar faces. When we made it to to Wise Shelter we decided to call it quits for the day and go into the shelter in hopes of staying dry. There was only one other couple in the shelter, so we took our spots and settled in.
Soon the rain came, and it rained hard. Eventually more and more hikers came and grabbed the remaining spots in the shelter and it filled quickly with more hiker still arriving. They all hoped for spots, but sadly one by one they headed off to either push on or set up their tents in the rain.Papa Dale and Kingsman were two of the later hikers to arrive looking quite wet. They set up nearby and soon there was quite a tent city around the shelter and just beyond. One later arrival decided she would sleep on the picnic table because it was under the overhang. Generally not a great practice, but people moved their stuff off the picnic table and she did just that. We are glad to be in the shelter where it is at least dry tonight, but it is cramped and damp.","Elk Garden (Grayson Highlands General Store)

We may have stayed mostly dry last night, but it wasn't a great night. As soon as we climbed into our bags a mouse was chewing something right over our heads where we had our stuff hanging. I shone my light in the general direction, but couldn't really see him on our stuff so we rolled over and tried to get some sleep. Soon after an animal, either a mouse or squirrel climbed into one of the hikers backpacks that was open and sitting just under the overhang. It must have climbed in and couldn't get out, but kept jumping up and scratching the side of the bag trying to get out. Only Mary, myself, and the guy next to me must have heard it because after a few minutes I heard him say ""Is anyone else concerned about that noise""? We roused the owner of the pack to tell him that something was in his pack. His response was ""I don't have anything in my pack"". My response was ""yes you do, an animal"". To lazy, or not concerned, he replied ""Somebody just knock my pack over"". The guy next to me tried to push it over with his outstretched pillow, but couldn't get it to topple over. Finally, I couldn't take it any longer and from my bag I reached my trekking pole and whacked his pack over into the mud and filth. I figured if he wasn't concerned, I wasn't either!
We finally got some sleep, but it reminds me why I don't like shelters. We were one of the first ones awake and going in the morning. (Couldn't have tea or breakfast at the table as the late arrival was still sleeping on the picnic table). The trail was very wet and had horrible footing. Foggy this morning as we hiked out of the highlands.  I realized what I thought was some trail debris in my sock bothering my heal yesterday was actually my shoes I had sent to me irritating my heels. As we made it to a campground at the road crossing we decided to eat lunch at the picnic tables. The sun was now peeking through, and it was warming up so we stopped to soak our feet at a stream before we climbed up to Comers Creek Cascade.
It was getting late, but we wanted to get as far as we could so we could make the 2:00 shuttle into Marion tomorrow. At Dickey Gap we were tired and decided to eat dinner before heading up the hill. Shortly after starting up from Dickey Gap, out of the corner of my eye I spied a bear charging downhill on a dead run away from us. We must have startled it when we were talking. That lifted our spirits to see the first bear of the hike! Within minutes we came upon Papa Dale & Kingsman camped at a small trailside site. We told them about seeing the bear, and they seemed very interested about what way it was travelling. 
We pushed on another mile or so to a campsite .3 off the trail. We were pleased to find it had a privy, picnic table, and was right next to a spring. It looked like it was seldom used, but we found a good site and quickly set up. The bad thing about it was I fell into the spring when the log I was standing on broke while gathering water. I managed to soak my shoes and socks. 
The last thing I did tonight was to remove the tape I put on my right heel to prevent a blister from the shoe irritation. As I pulled it off it was very sore as I peeled back the edges of the tape. When I got to where the irritation was it really hurt, so I decided the way to do it was just pull it fast in one fell swoop. Wrong! When I did this, I managed to rip off a hunk of skin. Well boy did it bleed. Mary and I scrounged around for something to mop up the blood without getting it all over my sleeping bag and the tent. I managed to get it bandaged, but now I have a 1/2 inch round raw section on my heel right where my shoe hits. Closer inspection of my shoes show I've worn a hole in the lining on both heels, so now there is a rough edge that irritated my heels. I've taped the holes, so hopefully this will help. Unfortunately, there are no real outfitters until Daleville, so I have to deal with it as best I can.","Wise Shelter

We were up early and packed quickly today because we have just enough time to hike the mileage and make the last shuttle at 2:00 into Marion. We hiked as hard as we could even though we were tired from a pretty big day yesterday. We also have no food left, other than breakfast and some snacks. 
As we hiked we kept track of our pace and realized we should be ok. We pulled into Partnership Shelter about 1:30. As soon as we talked to some hikers we learned the bad news, the shuttle doesn't run up to the visitor center (right near Partnership Shelter) on the weekends. We were informed that there was a guy, Jim Sparks, that was shuttling hikers for a donation. ""Minnesota"" gave us his number and we gave him a call, and soon he had us on the way into town. We arrived at the Travel Inn and found it was not really what we hoped for. Let's just say it needs to be updated and leave it at that... We decided we wouldn't be zeroing there, so we started getting our chores done.
We asked at the front desk about getting our laundry done, but we were told there were several people in front of us. So, we walked over to the Mexican Restaurant that we heard from the shuttle drive was nice and had a late lunch. After lunch we hit Ingles to check on resupply. We decided to walk downtown and meet Papa Dale & Kingsman who had just got into town and were staying at a much nicer place in town. The manager at Ingles called a cab and for $4 he brought us to the Army Navy store where I thought I might possibly find a pair of hiking shoes. On the ride to town we saw Papa Dale and Kingsman walking to the laundromat. Nothing at the Army Navy store so I called Kingsman and we met them at the laundromat to chat. We decided when their laundry was done we would got get a beer before dinner.
We walked back to the hotel they were staying in, which is very nice, and we felt a bit out of place because even though we showered our laundry was still dirty. They changed into their nice, clean clothes and we went across the street for a beer and appetizer. Kingsman bought us each a beer because he felt sorry for us in our crappy motel. We thanked him for the beer, which was very good, and we owe him one for that. Papa Dale voted for the BBQ joint across the street, so we went there for dinner and saw ""Donut"" and ""Spirit"" were already there. They joined us at our table and we had a good dinner with great company. We split a cab with Spirit and Donut back to Ingles where we did our resupply. Then, we walked back to our room where I started laundry about 10:30 pm. We want to get everything done because we are looking to head out tomorrow as early as possible.","Bobby Trail Campsite

Not up too early today after a late night resupply at Ingles and laundry until after 11:00 last night. No blankets again at our motel, so we used our sleeping bags under the sheet. Had cereal in our room for breakfast and then packed up and called Jim Sparks again for a ride back to the trail. 
We checked with Kingsman and Papa Dale to see what their plans are. They may go southbound for a couple of days back to Marion where Kingsman's daughter will meet up with them to hike a few days. 
Jim brought us back to the trail, and it was cool and windy when we started out, so we donned our hats and gloves again. Hard to believe it is almost May in Virginia and it's still so cold. The climbs we did today seemed doubly hard as we both have a lot of extra food. We packed 5 days resupply because the resupply points seem a little tough in this area. Back and forth today on being too hot on the climbs and a little cool on the descents, but overall a beautiful, sunny day.
Our plan isn't too ambitious today as we just want to get just shy of Atkins so we can eat breakfast at the Barn. On Sundays it closes at 3:00, and we wouldn't make it for lunch as we didn't hit the trail until nearly 11:00. We met a trail maintainer today that was doing a temporary trail around a ""dangerous tree"". He wasn't having much luck in getting hikers to follow the flagged trail. He questioned us if we had seen the sign for the detour, and we sheepishly admitted we had, but figured the tree wouldn't fall just then, so we quickly walked under it. We did thank him and chatted for a while.
We soon met Papa Dale & Kingsman hiking south, their plans hadn't changed so it will probably be a few days before we catch up with each other. They told us to check the Lindamood School House for trail magic. Lindamood School is an old 1894 one room school house that is now open and part of a museum. The local Baptist church has 3 boxes filled with all kinds of supplies for hikers. Sodas, snacks, toothpaste, tissues, hand sanitizer, and lots of other small medical and hygiene items. Very thoughtful, and very much appreciated. One local neighbor stopped by to chat and we had a hard time breaking free, I think he would have chatted all night.
We pushed on to a grassy knoll looking down on the farms and I-81. The sun is still up, so we have set up the tent, aired out some items, and are just relaxing in the sun as I try to catch up on the journal. It's rare we are in camp this early and it's quite warm and enjoyable. It's really quite peaceful even though you can hear the occasional train as well as traffic and voices from the farms below. We are actually enjoying hearing the train whistles blow. A few hikers have passed by and mentioned what a nice campsite we have.
Tomorrow we plan to be up early and at the Barn restaurant as soon as it opens.","Marion

It's official, I'm an idiot. I sent my cold weather gear home too early. After a beautiful day yesterday the temperature dropped on a clear night and we absolutely froze. I ended up putting on my pants, long sleeve shirt, and down coat, and hat and I was still cold. Mary was also in her hat and down jacket and she was cold as well. We woke to frost on the ground and tent. We quickly packed up and hobbled our cold, stiff bodies to the Barn Restaurant about 1 1/4 miles away. We had a good breakfast, but not as good as I remember Easter Dinner being in 2011 when I hiked. But, it got us warm and full again to start the day. My heel is still sore, so I cleaned it up and rebandaged it.
As we started back down the trail, which passes under I-81, we heard ""Hi There"". It was two hikers that passed our campsite last night just before dark. They had camped up under the overpass beams. They said the noise was constant, but they were warm. 
We hiked through some cow fields to get back to the ridges. It was warming up quickly, but both Mary and I were sluggish and tired all morning. We struggled up Little Brushy Mountain, and then after lunch and soaking our feet in a stream we did better with Walker Mountain. The sun was taking its toll though as we walked through several open pastures in the hot sun, and had to climb up quite a few fence stiles. By the time we reached the final climb of Brushy Mountain we struggled to the top and got in late. Tenting tonight, only Swimmer who is also thru hiking and another section hiker who was dropped off in Adkins are at the shelter.
I think I will leave the Bandaid on my heel tonight as last night I must have hit it and it started bleeding again. Should be warmer tonight, and even hotter tomorrow. Someone said it will get into the 80's. We will have to see how it goes. On the plus side, we have hiked over 1/4 of the trail now.","Campsite prior to Atkins

Finally able to get up this morning and not freeze. We had breakfast at the picnic table with Swimmer and the section hiker (can't remember his name). Late getting out of camp as we slept in a little, and didn't rush since it was warm.
Nice downhill to start the day to get loosened up. A quick 600' climb up and over Lynn Camp Mountain and the day was starting to get hot (seems like we went right from winter to summer and skipped spring). By the time we started the 2100' climb up Chestnut Knob we were really beginning to overheat. We cooled our head with towels in the stream down lower and this seemed to help. We made it to the spring at the pond and needed more water, and it was nearly noon. We decided to push on the .8 to the summit to eat lunch. After what seemed like forever for just .8 miles I rechecked the book and realized I was wrong, it was really 1.8 miles to the summit. By the time we arrived it was 1:45 and we were starved. We ate, and took our shoes off and relaxed in the grass on the summit. We spent about an hour working on our tans (just kidding, we had sunscreen on) in the breeze on top. Also at the summit with us were Honeybadger, Smiles, and Penguin who we've seen off and on this section of trail.
It was getting late so we pushed on. There wasn't any water on the long rocky ridge we had to cross, so we hiked on the 7 plus miles to the first campsite with water. That is Davis Farm Campsite which is .5 miles off trail down a steep switchback. We were pretty exhausted when we arrived and the sun had already set. It is on a steep slope, but they have flattened a site for a couple of tents. It is a great view of the valley below, and looks west for a great sunset. When we arrived there was a hammocker already set up on the hill (""Dynasty""). By the time we ate, got set up and all our chores done it is now 10:00. Both of us are sore tonight and my heel is still a mess. I am having trouble taping it. Off to bed with the sound of cows mooing in the valley below.","Knot Maul Shelter

We listened to cows in the valley mooing a lot last night. We also heard owls, turkeys, and coyotes during the night. Sounded like the coyotes were very close by. Surprisingly, I slept quite well and had trouble getting up this morning. Found out our fellow camper was another thru hiker whose trail name is Dynasty (like Duck Dynasty) who started in late February. He had some good snow stories to tell of going through the Smoky Mountains.
We ate, packed up, and got kind of a late start around 8:30. By the time we made it back up the hill to the trail again it was nearly 9:00. A little more rocky ridge walk, but as we started down toward the next shelter the trail smoothed out and was quite nice. We got water at the shelter and talked to a trail crew that was coming in to take care of some blow downs. We are in a wilderness area, so all work has to be done with hand tools. As always, we thanked them for their work. We also tried to clean some of the built up grime off our bodies as it's been hot and sweat and salt builds up, and if you don't try to clean up some it is difficult to sleep.
Climbed up from the stream onto the ridge for several miles. The temperature today is again quite hot, but at least the trail has better footing. When we came off the ridge we came to Laurel Creek where we got more water and soaked our aching feet in the cold water. It felt good, but we had to get moving because we had 7 miles to make it to the Brushy Mountain Outpost that closes at 8:00, and it is already after lunch. The Brushy Mountain Outpost is right on the trail and serves hot food, cold drinks, ice cream, and has some resupply. We are hoping to stop in for dinner and a few resupply items.
The trail was excellent, but at the end of a long, hot day it is always tough on the uphills. When we got to the road we met a runner who passed us doing some trail running both ways. He offered us a ride, but since the road is part of the trail we politely declined. He understood that we didn't want to skip any of the trail. We were proud of ourselves for making it to the Outpost by 5:50.
 I sat down at the picnic table and was talking to ""Trial"" and ""Error"", a couple of hikers when ""Trial"" mentioned ""If you want ice cream you better hurry up, they close at 6:00"". I quickly ran in and found out she was right, I had misread the time in the guide book. Fortunately, the owner was very nice and said part of the grill was closed, but we could still get burgers. We each had a burger and fries and shared an ice cream. The owner even let us sit inside to eat while they cleaned up. We hesitated about hiking on as the owner offered to let us camp out back and have breakfast in the morning. 
Ultimately, we decided to do the 2 plus miles to the next shelter. So, with super full bellies, we headed down the steep road to the overpass to cross I-77 and then even lower into the valley only to turn off the road and head up a very steep set of switch backs for about a mile. After sitting and eating all that food our bodies weren't too happy about getting going again, especially our stomachs. We made good time and found a nice, soft camping spot. Of course, this shelter is .3 off the trail and the water is .3 down a steep hill. This is the shelter that I had the worst day and night on my 2011 hike, so I had some reservations about going here again. Water is so scarce in this area that it is the best option.
After a long day we boiled some water and cleaned up a little so hopefully we will sleep well tonight. I guess my heel is getting better, well at least it's not getting worse. It is still sore and gets more painful as the day goes on, but doesn't look any worse. Once again I figured the mileage wrong, so we should be at Trent's Grocery tomorrow, not in two days. That is a good thing because we both need a shower bad. Tomorrow we should pass the 600 mile mark, and it will be our 16th day in a row hiking.
Off to bed because we have 15 miles to do tomorrow before we get showers.","Davis Farm Campsite

It's warm this morning, so i'm starting to like this weather better to get the day started. We both were sore, but got loosened up once we were hiking. Good trail this morning with the typical up and downs. 
Mary left the shelter first this morning and met a deer standing on the trail. She said it stood there looking at her for quite a while until she finally started quietly talking to it, then it slowly bounded off. 
It warmed up quickly today, but on the ridge there was a slight breeze which made it tolerable.
We dropped down off the ridge to a road crossing and then back up another Brushy Mountain. This one took its toll and we trudged into Jenny Knob Shelter for lunch already beat for the day. We filled up on water and wet ourselves down for the final 6.5 miles to Trent's. 
The heat was tough now and the climb up some unnamed ridge with the power lines did us in.  As we were coming down the final hill to the road that leads to Trent's we came upon a meadow, and as I hiked  along I spotted a good size bear foraging in the grass. We got a quick picture and then tried to get its attention by talking to it and clicking our poles so it would look up. He finally looked up and started to meander into the woods. Mary gave a load click with the poles and it hightailed it into the woods. So, she is now our official bear defense. If we see any more bears that worry us, she'll scare them off. (Mary here - I think they should be scared of humans, after all, there is a bear season...)
The downhill to the road took its toll on Mary's knees, but at last we arrived at the road where Trent's is located. We walked the .5 miles on the highway to Trent's (no one stopped to offer us a lift). At Trent's we ordered hot food and had cold drinks. We decided to camp here tonight and do our resupply in the morning. 
Trent's camping area is a lawn area out next to a horse pasture that has some run down trailers, picnic tables and a run down bath/laundry house. It is certainly not the Ritz, but we set up our tent on soft, green grass, took showers, and got our laundry done all cheaply.
We made the 600 mile mark, but are feeling run down and are looking forward to a zero day soon. We haven't decided where to zero yet, but probably Daleville. From Pearisburg to Daleville the resupply looks pretty sparse, so we may have to carry quite a few days. 
Our feet are doing better, Mary's foot is not as swollen, and my heel seems to finally be healing. New problem though, Mary is bothered by pain in her right shoulder she thinks is being caused by her pack. We already made a reservation for the MacArthur Inn in Narrows, so we'll be there in two days.","Helveys Mill Shelter

Packed up our things which were quite dewy from staying in the field. Went up to the store for breakfast, but they only had one biscuit sandwich left and no hot water for tea (finding hot tea in the south is a challenge). Mary had the biscuit sandwich and I got a BLT. We grabbed a couple of snacks and some Gatorades and headed out to walk the .5 miles back to the trail.
Another hot one today, after looking like it might rain early. By the time we made it the 2 miles to Dismal Falls we were in our shorts/skirt and tee shirts. After a quick stop at the falls for some pictures we traveled the flat, shady section through rhododendron thicket.
Lots of water and stream crossings through this section. Even though it was somewhat shaded we had no energy and trudged along in the heat. We had lunch at Dismal Creek and soaked our feet in the creek while we ate. Shortly after lunch we stopped at Wapiti Shelter and met ""Hippo"", a hiker from Germany. He had somehow gotten passed by his hiking partner ""Treebeard"" earlier in the day (which he didn't know) and had been waiting for him at the shelter for over 2 hours. We informed him that we had met ""Treebeard"" about three miles back after we stopped to have lunch. This meant ""Treebeard"" now had to be at least 5 or 6 miles ahead. With this news ""Hippo"" quickly packed up and hustled out to try to catch his partner. We also headed out and started the steep, rocky, and by this time very hot climb up onto the ridge.
We struggled to make some miles, and wanted to get as many as we could so our day into town tomorrow won't be too long. By the time we reached the Ribble Trail we were ready to quit for the day and decided to eat dinner before we set up camp on the somewhat flat trail. While dinner was cooking I checked out the Fire Service road and saw a section of burn area from a prescribed burn that the forest service was doing. We have been smelling smoke from the prescribed burns and another actual brush fire for the last couple of days. 
Down near the burn area a truck was parked and a guy got out and started pulling a squeaky metal cart out into the woods toward where we were eating. When he got close enough he saw us and promptly turned around and went the other way. It was all a little strange, so our gut told us maybe this wasn't a good place to camp. We finished dinner and headed on.
The trail went through the burn area, so when we got down to it we realized the trail was closed and you had to walk around the burn area, down the gravel road to rejoin the trail. The sign wasn't real clear as to where we were supposed to go, and now it was starting to rain. We hustled down the road getting wetter and wetter hoping we were going the correct way. We found where the trail crossed again and there was a campsite right there. We were about to set up when another truck came by and made us think twice about setting up next to a road on a friday night. We quickly started up the climb hoping to find a stealth site, but the trail soon turned rocky, and the rain came down harder. The longer we hiked the darker it got and the less fussy we were about a potential campsite. As the rained slacked off a little we quickly threw our tent up underneath a rhododendron in a semi-flat spot. By the time we were set up I was hanging a bear bag by headlamp. Everything got a little damp and Mary has a sizeable rock underneath her hip on her side of the tent, but we should be able to get some sleep, and we will be in town tomorrow. 
Note from Mary: When Alan says we are tired, beat, etc it is usually me.. But, as he says, we are a team.
A couple of quotes from other hikers we like:
""Never underestimate the rejuvenating powers of a hot shower""
""That is why they make the windshield of your car bigger than the back window."" - In other words, look to the future, not the past

Rain stopped early last night so we didn't need to pack up in the rain, but the gear was wet. Finished the climb and went along the ridge again moving slowly as it was warm and humid today. Stopped about 3 miles in for a tea break as we needed a little boost. Finished the ridge and started the descent into town which is long and very steep. Mary nearly took a tumble on some wet, slippery rocks which made her a little more cautious. As we neared the bottom we heard rumbles of thunder which quickened our pace.
When we arrived at the bottom of the trail a trail angel was waiting and offered to shuttle our packs over to the trail head parking where we could get picked up by the MacArthur Inn. This meant we could make the last 1.1 miles quickly without our packs. We grabbed our wallets, cameras and phones and headed out. We made quick work of that section, especially with the impending storm. Shortly after we arrived the  woman from Angel's Rest Hiker Haven Hostel arrived with our packs. We called Allen Neely, the owner of the Inn, and he quickly arrived to pick us up. Allen is a very interesting man and gave us a quick history lesson of the area and his historic Inn on the ride over.
Donut and Spirit, who we thought we would never see again, got a shuttle back to the Inn for a zero. They are about 30 miles further along the trail. Redhawk and Cribbage are also staying at the Inn along with other hikers we just met this morning. Later, Kingsman & Papa Dale arrived along with Bluegrass who we haven't seen since Georgia.
We got cleaned up, did our laundry and planned to meet at Anna's, the local restaurant for dinner. It's prom night so Allen has brought his old, beautiful carriage onto the steps of the Inn and invited all the prom couples and locals to come and have pictures taken out of the rain. He later told us he had about 70 couples plus their families all show up for pictures. He expected half a dozen or so since he had just posted his offer on facebook earlier in the day, and he was very pleased that so many took advantage of his offer. It was fun to watch the kids all dressed up come and pose for pictures with family. 
We had dinner with Spirit, Donut, Papa Dale, Kingsman, Cribbage and Redhawk. Later we sat around the dining area of the Inn and had a beer and some more ""lemonade"" with Papa Dale, Kingsman, and Allen. Allen has many stories from his mining/construction days. We stayed up late, but are zeroing tomorrow after 18 consecutive days hiking.
By the way, I think today is the day we saw a bunny along the trail. It actually hopped out in front of Mary which made her jump, I wasn't sure what startled her until she pointed out the bunny. It stayed and let us take a few pictures before it hopped slowly off.","Campsite after Sugar Run Gap

Slept in a little today, then had breakfast that the Inn does on weekends. Spirit and Donut are shuttling back to where they got off trail, about 30 miles north, so we said our goodbyes. It is doubtful we will catch them again as they do some pretty big miles. Papa Dale & Kingsman are shuttling out to do 18 or so miles south on a slackpack, this is the same slackpack we hope to do tomorrow.
We didn't do much today other than rest. I did make a trip to the bank and Dollar General about 1/2 mile over the bridge to get some cash and a few resupply items. About 2:00 we ate at Anna's and had the buffet, it was filling and I had a short nap after eating. Allen let Mary use the computer to get a little work done on the journal. Later Papa Dale and Kingsman came back from their slackpack and said it was tough because all the rain last night left the streams and creeks raging, also the trail was extremely wet.
We cooked a pizza for dinner and enjoyed beer with Kingsman & Papa Dale after they cleaned up. We are going to get shuttled tomorrow for a slackpack of nearly 20 miles, so off to bed.","Narrows, VA (MacArthur Inn)

(Slackpacking South back to the Inn today)
Up early, packed a light pack and ate cereal and had some orange juice. Allen ran us out to the trailhead once again giving us a history lesson of the area as well as identifying a tree for us. When we arrived at the trailhead we saw Honeybadger & Smiles who were getting ready to head north on the trail with a friend. 
The trail was quite wet for the first mile, but nothing like it was yesterday and we managed to keep our feet pretty dry. It felt good to only have a light pack, and Mary had no pack. We made good time up the ridge. We followed the ridge and passed several hikers we hadn't seen in a while including Bobo, Waterboy, and Wicked. We stopped for lunch at the Groundhog Trail, and met up with a maintainer working on the Groundhog Trail clearing blow downs. 
When we came through Symms Gap we came across the protesters who were camping and sitting in some trees to protest the pipeline that will cross here. They had some signs up and we could see a couple of large tents. Forest personnel were also there watching over the protesters. We didn't stop, just had to keep hiking on. Even though we were lightly loaded, by the time we reached Rice Field Shelter we were ready to be done. We still had over 6 miles to go of mostly down.
The weather had turned and we could hear rumbles of thunder. As we headed down we met a ton of hikers coming out of town heading for Rice Field Shelter. I'm sure it will be packed tonight. In the last 3 miles we met Katherine and Taylor doing the same slackpack. By now with weather threatening and us running out of energy we struggled to make it to the end. When we arrived we quickly called our shuttle and managed to beat most of the rain, only getting lightly sprinkled on. 
Back at the Inn we realized Mary's legs had gotten all rashy. She showered while I got our resupply and cooked a pizza as Donna's is closed on Mondays. We ate, enjoyed some beer left by other hikers, cleaned up and Mary conked out, I will be asleep soon as well!","Narrows, VA (MacArthur Inn)

Didn't get up too early as we were still tired from yesterday. Packed up all our stuff, had breakfast and waited for our shuttle. Allen was running several shuttles this morning, so we didn't arrive back at the trail until almost 10:30. Said our goodbyes, took a picture with Allen and then we started off.
I knew this was going to be a tough day, because when I was packing our packs I realized I bought too many snacks again. We have a 5 day resupply and all the food wouldn't fit in my pack. I'm stuffed to the gills and Mary has all the excess which is making both of our packs extremely heavy. Our packs are the heaviest they have been, and it's the day after a slack pack, so we are struggling. Not only are our packs heavy, but the trail is horrible. Today the trail is either mud or a stream, and there is lots of debris and blowdowns to navigate. 
By the time we made the miles to the first shelter we decided to have lunch. Deluxe had packed out a cookie cake for Katherine (Murph) because it is her birthday. When she and Taylor arrived we all sang happy birthday to her. All seven of us at the shelter had a piece of the cake and Katherine got two pieces.
After lunch we struggled to get to the ridge in the heat, and the top was kind of rocky. Slow going along the top, but we did get some views and we saw several deer that let us get quite close. It was getting late as we started the descent toward the shelter. By the time we arrived there were some tears shed, but we did make it.

Got up and had breakfast and we were hoping for a better day. The trail this morning was better, though we had to take our shoes off for one stream crossing. Soon we were climbing the ridge again. We leap frogged with Spirit Man who we met last night. Thankfully we did the climb this morning, because it got quite hot and humid as the day went on.
We walked a quick ridge and got some great views on Kelly Knob. The trail was good as we headed to Laurel Creek Shelter for lunch. We were looking for a place to soak our feet in the heat, but the stream we saw on the map was in the middle of a pasture, and it didn't look to appealing. The field walk in the blazing sun was tough. Once we got to the woods it was even tougher as it was a steep up, some of the steepest trail we've seen.
Once up on the ridge we knew we wouldn't make Niday Shelter which was still 7 miles away as it was getting late. We settled for Sarver Hollow Shelter, but the shelter is .4 off the trail down a steep switch back. While I was getting water Mary saw her third bear along with a couple other hikers as they sat at the picnic table at the shelter (Knotty Boy & Tinkerbell). The bear was up on the hill above the shelter and seemed to be looking right at them at the table before it slowly moved on.

Up early and packed up. A quick breakfast and we headed back up to the trail. The .4 back up to the trail is probably the steepest climb we will have all day.
The ridge we walked this morning was all ledge walk with great views. It slowed Mary down due to all the rock scrambling, but we made it through with out any incidents. 
We arrived at the next shelter around 11:00 and we filled up on water and heated water for tea to enjoy with our almond biscuits. We didn't take time for tea at breakfast, but needed a cup now. Mary found a small wooden cross necklace along the trail that had ""AT"" on one side and ""LOVE"" on the other. She picked it up hoping that maybe we will find the owner further down the trail.
Down in the valley we crossed Craig Creek where we had lunch, soaked our feet and took a layer of crud off our legs with our pack cloths. As we were leaving we heard rumbles of thunder. The sound of thunder really got Mary going, and she made good time up Brush Mountain. I'm not sure where she was hurrying to because there is no shelter up there. The storm passed mostly to our north and we got some wind and a few rain drops and then it cleared up. 
We took a break from the long climb at the bench on top and Mary did her stretching before we proceeded on to visit the Audie Murphy Monument. We searched for ""Chainsaws"" patch he had left in 2011 and he verified was still there in 2015 when he hiked the section again, but we couldn't find it. We saw ""Donut"" (the second Donut we have met) and her friend Sophie, we've been leap frogging with them today. 
As we started to leave the monument rumbles of thunder could be heard again. We scurried to finish the ridge and get lower. Once again the storm skirted us, this time to our south. Same thing, some wind and sprinkles as the edge of the storm went by. Back down in the valley we took the time to clean up again as we worked up a sweat going up Brush Mountain. We talked with two hikers, ""No Intentions"" & ""Hippity Hop Pop"", who were camped by the stream. They said Pickle Branch Shelter was probably going to be full as a lot of hikers had passed by. We decided to head there anyway to get a few more miles in so we can hopefully make Catawba and the Homeplace Restaurant tomorrow. ""No Intentions"" & ""Hippity Hop Pop"" are thru hikers who got off trail for a week or more and are back on hiking SOBO back to where they got off trail. Then, their son will pick them up and bring them back to the spot they need to head North from. Just as we were leaving Sourpatch and TI84 came to the bridge and decided to camp there as they were only doing 8 miles tomorrow to a hostel. As we headed out I heard rumbles of thunder again. By the time I caught Mary it was looking dark. We didn't luck out this time, first a few sprinkles, and then as we donned our pack covers it started raining hard. It only lasted 10 to 15 minutes, but it was enough to soak us.
We went to the shelter and found it vacant except for Tinkerbell, who was camped at a site on the way in. We changed, ate dinner, and met Molasses just as we were packing up to find a campsite up the hill. We found a site and it was sprinkling a little. About the time we crawled in the tent no less than 3 whippoorwills started with their call. 
We have been seeing lots of deer now, every day we see at least one. We also saw lots of these lizards or gecko type things that scurry about in the leaf litter and really blend in. This last week we've seen many Scarlet Tanagers, but the most common bird we've seen is the Rufus Sided Towhee, they seem to be everywhere.
If all works out, we should be eating at the Homeplace tomorrow on our anniversary. It is an all you can eat place that I heard about on my first hike, but it was closed on the day I hiked by. We need to get up early to make it though, so off to bed.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

Woke up to the same sound as when we went to bed, Whippoorwill. We heard the calling of the Whippoorwills all night. Everything is still damp this morning, but it is not raining. 
Made the climb up to Dragon's Tooth. It starts out gradual, but then gets steeper and you climb up a series of ledgey areas, each one a littler higher than the last. Each time we thought we were there, it would be another climb. Finally we came to a stunning overlook and the side trail to the actual Dragon's Tooth. We met Swimmer who is slack packing this section to test out his ankle that he twisted. I made the climb up to the tippy top of Dragon's Tooth, but was unable to convince Mary to join me (Mary here, and there was no way I was climbing up there!) Hopefully she got some good shots of me on the top. After all the photos we started down the trail.
The next mile of trail was tough with lots of rock scrambling on some steep sections, and even some iron holds in the rock. I don't think this was Mary's favorite part, but she did make it down. We made the next road crossing only to find the 4 Pines Hostel trail magic cooler empty. Just before we decided to move on up pulls a van and out jumps Midnight and Buttercup who are helping out at the hostel. They were there to refill the cooler with PBR & Pepsi. We both took a Pepsi, thanked them and decided to move on to the stream to have lunch. We met some hikers who said they usually do trail magic on Friday, but today they were hiking instead. They asked us if we thought there would be a lot of hikers coming behind us, and we said we have heard that the ""bubble"" is about a week behind us.
We had six miles and another ridge to go to get to the next road crossing where you can go into town to the Homeplace. The weather was downright hot today, and Mary struggled to get the miles in the heat. When we finally made the road crossing I was a little worried because she looked like she might pass out. We waited, hoping to get a ride the 1.3 miles to the restaurant, but had no luck. Mary actually went over to a pickup that pulled in and asked if he was heading that way, but it was a firefighter who was going to hike out a mile north to check on a fire that has been burning off and on. Several day hikers chatted with us about our hike, but no one offered a ride. Seems a lot different than in the Whites where people stop to see if you need a ride back to your car or in to town. After about 30 minutes I got frustrated and we decided to just walk the road, or we might not make it in time for dinner. Today is our 33rd wedding anniversary, and we really wanted a nice dinner.
The road is not a good one to walk along as the traffic flies by at 55 mph +, and in places there wasn't much shoulder. The heat was still brutal, but we made it there and soon saw a big group of familiar thru hikers who had been shuttled there from 4 Pines Hostel (they were all showered and in clean clothes). An older gentleman saw Mary walking toward the restaurant and said ""you look tired"" she said ""I am tired"". He replied, ""I'm tired just walking from my car to the restaurant"", to which she replied ""We walked over 700 miles to get here to enjoy dinner on our 33 Anniversary"". The gentleman wanted to shake her hand, even after she said ""I'm dirty, we've been on trail all day"". It didn't matter, he insisted on shaking her hand and wishing us well. I think it was his grandson with him who said he was trying to explain about thru hikers to the older gentleman, but he just didn't understand why people did such a long hike.
We put our name in at the restaurant and we were quickly seated. The food was great and it was wonderful to be in the air conditioning. We did feel bad for the patrons around us as I'm sure we smell quite bad as we haven't had a shower in 4 or 5 days. Hiking in this heat we are certainly not at our finest! Most folks were all dressed up, many looking like they had just come from graduations. We didn't get thrown out and nobody gave us dirty looks (at least not to our faces). A nearby patron who was asking Mary about the hike outside even offered to take our picture and he and his group wished us a happy anniversary. So, we got to enjoy a great meal on our anniversary after a long, hot day on trail.
The second group of hikers were getting picked up by the hostel, so we asked if we could get shuttled to the store and back to the trail. He said he would run the group back to the hostel and come back for us. I'm glad he did, because our waitress had said the store was only .5 miles away when in reality it was 4 or 5 miles. We were soon resupplied and back at the trail crossing. It was now dark and we donned headlamps to make the mile up to the shelter. Saw a snake in the trail on the way up, but not sure what kind. Made it to the shelter and set up in a badly sloped site, but the best available. It is going to be a long night as it is still very warm and we are hot and sticky.","Pickle Branch Shelter

What a miserable night, we slid downhill all night and it was so hot and sticky that we didn't sleep well at all. 
We packed up and ate quickly, we already heard day hikers heading up to McAfee Knob. Being that it is a Saturday we figured it would be packed. 
As we headed up we did see a fair amount of people, some heading up and some already coming back down. Both of us got our pictures out on the knob and then we talked with another thru hiker and I took her picture for her. Headed up the trail toward Tinker Cliffs. Another hot day, the hottest we have had yet on the trail. 
Made it to Tinker Cliffs for lunch where we hung out for a while enjoying the view. We wanted to make it as close to Daleville as we can so that we have a short day tomorrow.
Lots of ups and downs after the cliffs with some rocky areas that really slowed us down in the heat. We were going to dry camp tonight so we loaded up on water at the shelter and headed up. We ran out of steam about 5 miles from town, but we did find a nice, flat, soft site. 
Set up our tent, ate, and headed to bed. It is pretty looking down into town, but it is still very hot.","Johns Spring Shelter

Up about 5:30 and packed up after another long hot night. Still a lot of ridge to cross before we started the descent into town. We arrived about 9:30 looking for a good breakfast. We decided to check at the Super 8 to see where we could eat. The woman at the desk let us check in early, and even offered us their continental breakfast. Since it is mother's day we decided to find a more appropriate place to eat. 
We were happy to get showered after 6 days and put on our cleanest clothes to walk down to Angelle's Diner. The woman at the desk recommended it, and she was right, we had a wonderful mother's day breakfast. It was a small diner, and watching them prepare the food was amazing. On the way back to our room we grabbed a couple of items for resupply.
Back at the hotel we started our laundry and we both called our moms to wish them a happy mother's day and cleaned and organized our gear. It is another scorcher today, well into the 90's.
Later we walked down to the Kroegers for resupply and then stopped at the Three Lil Pigs BBQ restaurant for dinner. We each ordered a large IPA, looking forward to a tasty beer. We were disappointed in the beer, and actually asked if they served us the one we ordered. The food was really good, and hikers (maybe all patrons?) get a free banana pudding dessert which was yummy.
When we walked back to the hotel with our six bags of resupply the bank thermometer was still reading 93 at 6:00. Working on the journal tonight and trying to rest. Looks like another hot day tomorrow and then thunderstorms for 2 or 3 days. Should be interesting.","Campsite just outside of Daleville, VA

We didn't really want to get up early today, but apparently the people in the next room had their alarm clock set for around 2:30 am and left before turning it off. We know because the alarm was sounding and we could hear it in our room. Finally at around 5:30 we checked outside our room and one of the workers called down to the desk. Eventually after some discussion about whether or not anyone was in the room they entered the room and shut the alarm off. We tried going back to sleep, but by this time we were both pretty much awake.
When breakfast started we went down for the tea and waffles. We packed our gear and I ran down to the outfitter to see if they had any shoes to replace mine. I also needed a canister and a few other items. Mary stayed behind to work on the journal. When I went by the bank thermometer at 8:40 it read 86 degrees, so it is going to be another hot one. I did buy another food bag, so now I have two smaller ones that seem to fit the food better than one large one.
When I got back to the room we decided to mail a few more items home because it looks like it has warmed up for sure now. Called a cab and he ran us down to the post office. It cost more fore the cab than to mail the package, but we didn't want to make the long road walk in the heat. 
When the cab dropped us back at the trailhead which is right near the Super 8 and a small store it was getting near lunch so we decided we better eat something before we headed out. The convenience store does BBQ pork out back, and we each grabbed a sandwich and drink and ate at the picnic table before we hit the trail. Bluegrass joined us for a moment before he headed up the trail, he had just come from Pizza Hut. As always, leaving town our packs are heavy, and it is hot.
The trail wasn't to severe today, lots of ups and downs but nothing extreme. We made pretty good time and drank lots of water and sweat plenty. Stopped for a water refill at Fullhardt Shelter and then moved on for Wilson Creek Shelter. Played leap frog with Bluegrass, Tinkerbell, and another hiker most of the day. The shelter is packed tonight with 6 or so and probably 10 to 12 tents. Considering the heat and the time we left, I thought we did pretty good today. The A/C and showers seem like a long time ago after hiking with a pack on your back all day.

Heard something walking around outside last night. I was afraid it may be a bear trying to get my food bag, so I got up to try and scare it off. When I got outside the tent with my red headlamp on I saw 2 red eyes staring back. When I went to switch my headlamp to full bright I cycled by flashing red, to low white, then high white. It turns out it was a deer and the lights must have freaked him out because I saw him jump up in the air and slip slide away thrashing about in the leaves.
We got up pretty early today as we wanted to get going before it got too hot. The terrain was nice today as we entered the Blue Ridge Parkway. We parallel the parkway for quite a few miles, often crossing back and forth across it. We stopped early this morning at one of the lookouts with a picnic table and had tea and almond biscuits, very good and just the boost we needed.
It stayed a little cloudy this morning, so the sun wasn't brutally hot. We hiked through a very pretty area today, the rhododendron and azaleas are all in bloom and the mountain laurel is partially in bloom. With the hot weather everyone was hoping to make it to the swimming hole at Jennings Creek. 
A bunch of us stopped for water and lunch just before Cove Mountain. Once we started up the hill the sun was out in full force and we were sweating bad. Just as soon as we crested the hill and started the descent to Jennings Creek, 5 miles away, we started to hear rumbles of thunder and the sky darkened. We raced to Cove Mountain shelter to try to avoid the storm.  We made it just prior to any rain, but the storm seemed to be all around us, but not right over head. We waited about 45 minutes, but it really just sprinkled off and on with the thunder all around. Bluegrass was at the shelter waiting out the storm, and he moved on while we still waited for a bit more. 
Finally it stopped enough that we decided to go for it. We headed out in a drizzle which of course picked up as we hiked. We did the 3 or so miles pretty quickly, but arrived at the swimming hole to find about 5 or more trout fishermen all around the deeper pools where you can swim. Apparently they had just stocked it today according to a couple of the fishermen. We were kind of dejected, but remembered reading in the logs about people going for milkshakes and we saw what they were talking about. There was a sign advertising a campground that had a grill and did burgers, fries, and milkshakes. The sign said they would do a free pickup, so we called. Soon we were on our way to Mill Creek Campground.
We arrived at the campground and found that many a hiker had taken advantage of the offer. We ordered food and considered staying in the bunkhouse, but it didn't look too appealing. We could also camp, but figured we could just as easily camp in the woods for free. We ended up eating, taking a quick shower, and getting shuttled back. The food was good and the shower felt great after all the heat. We went up the hill a couple tenths and found a campsite to spend the night. Big climb tomorrow, so off to bed.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Damp this morning as we packed up. We decided to do breakfast at Bryant Ridge Shelter about 3 1/2 miles away. The day started with a 1,000' climb then 800 feet back down to the shelter, all before breakfast. I remembered Bryant Ridge shelter as a nice post and beam shelter that has 3 levels to it. The shelter was still nice, but the no-see-ums nearly drove us mad. When we arrived a couple of hikers (Molasses an another hiker) were discussing whether to have breakfast there or not since the bugs were so bad. That should have been a clue that we should move on, but we were hungry and needed to eat. It was very difficult to eat and get water as you had to constantly swat the no-see-ums. We quickly ate, not really enjoying it, and moved on.
It was a long series of climbs today, each one seemingly brought us higher until we ended up over 4,000' on Apple Orchard Mountain. The summit has a large FAA dome on top. The forest understory has really greened up now, and it was a sea of green, but loaded with many different wildflowers. Today's climb brought mostly pink, purple and white trillium. Two shades of pink lady slippers are everywhere, quite often in groups of 5 or more. There are also bunches of purple flowers that come in several shades. We will try to post some pictures, and I'm sure someone can tell us what they are. We also have a picture of a couple of flowers that look like yellow lady slippers, but we are not sure that is what they are.
We saw another rabbit on the climb today that didn't seem too scared. After summitting Apple Orchard Mountain we made our way down a rocky scramble to the guillotine. The guillotine is a large boulder caught between two ledge pillars that the trail goes under.
It was sprinkling off and on all day, so we didn't really get any views. As we made our way into Thunder Hill shelter it started to rain a little harder.  The rain let up as we cooked our dinner. We wanted a few more miles so we could make it into Glasgow fairly early tomorrow, so we set out for a campsite 3 1/2 miles away. Of course once we got going it really started to rain. We hiked pretty hard to stay warm, but the trail was turning into a muddy stream. We were soaking wet now, but we hoped that the rain would let up enough to get our tent set up. By the time we arrived it was only misting and we set up quickly on a wet spot. By the time we got the tent set up the rain picked up and we dove into the tent and dried off as much as possible. It is going to be a long, damp night, but we should be able to get cleaned up in Glasgow.","Campsite after Jennings Creek (VA 614)

Tough getting going this morning as it rained hard last night and splashed mud and dirt all up under and on the sides of the tent. Everything in the vestibule is wet and muddy. Naturally none of our clothing or shoes dried last night, and most of the stuff in the tent is damp. I got dressed in my cold, wet shorts, socks, shirt and shoes and started getting the bear bags down when the rain started again. I had on my soggy rain coat, so I just stood in the rain and told Mary to wait inside the tent. I didn't dare go back in the tent as I would have made things even wetter getting back in.
After about 15 minutes the rain pretty much stopped and we stuffed our dry stuff in bags and our wet stuff in other bags and packed up and headed out. A few hikers from the shelter we left last night passed by and said they wondered how we had made out. They said there was some concern about us in the shelter. We told them we were damp, but fine. (Rabbit, Rayburn)
It was foggy most of the day, but the sun was trying to break through. Once we were on the ridge we stopped to air out our soggy feet and give them a break. As soon as we got service we called the hostel to arrange a pickup at 2:30. We didn't have too much extra time today because we had a pickup time, but we did stop at Matt's Creek Shelter. Ironically, Mary soaked her feet in the stream while I sat at the picnic table and tried to dry my socks and shoes.
After lunch we made the short trip to the James River foot bridge. A long train was passing just before we arrived at the bridge, 118 cars I think. Janet (Laugh's mom) said she counted the cars. We thought we had plenty of time and we chatted with ""Live"" and ""Love"" (Laugh's parents, Janet & Alan), but soon we realized our shuttle was here and we had to leave. There was some trail magic on the other side of the bridge, so before we hopped in the shuttle we were given some homemade chocolate chip cookies and a rootbeer for the ride.
When we arrived at the hostel we quickly began laying out our wet things on the lawn and hung items on the clothes line to dry. Papa Dale, and Kingsman stayed last night and are slackpacking back to the hostel. Our bed was upstairs in the hostel in a ""semi-private room"" which we shared with ""Spirit Man"" and ""Hydro"". Another hiker had just taken a shower and told us the water was cold, so we were waiting for it to warm up. ""Sailor Pete"" told us there was plenty of hot water the day before, so we thought we would be all set. After trying the water in the sink various times we called the woman who takes care of the hostel. She said it was probably because everyone was showering and doing laundry, but ""Sailor Pete"" said the day before there was no issue with more laundry and showers taking place. We all eventually took varying degrees of cold/warm showers and got our laundry done.
Papa Dale & Kingsman arrived back at the hostel, and we planned to meet them at Scotto's for dinner. Swimmer, Papa Dale, and Kingsman joined us at the restaurant for dinner. Also there were Rayburn, Sailor Pete, and Rabbit. We also found out we wouldn't be able to slackpack back to the hostel tomorrow as a family has rented the whole hostel for the next couple of days. The weather doesn't look good for tomorrow, but I guess we will be heading out and making the best of it.

The day was a little rushed, we had to pay the person running the hostel. All hikers were trying to get ready which meant the one bathroom was constantly busy. We paid, grabbed our stuff, almost forgetting our water and left over pizza as the shuttle driver was in the car waiting on us.
We were dropped off back at the James River Bridge along with Sailor Pete. Started out with rain gear on and pack covers on, we knew we were in for a wet day. Big climb right off the bat as we headed up Big Rocky Row and on to Bluff Mountain.
We made it to the Ottie Cline Powell monument and Mary left the cross necklace she had found earlier on as a tribute to Ottie. No views for us today. As we moved on we saw Batman and his dog Bella (Robin) as well as another couple hikers eating their lunch.
Stopped at Punch Bowl Shelter for lunch, which was already crowded with hikers getting out of the rain to eat their lunch. We ate standing outside under the overhang, attempting to stay a little dry. The group in the shelter were all spread out and didn't offer to consolidate their stuff so others could get out of the rain. There were three older men who were waiting to get into the shelter as they were planning on staying for the night. Sailor Pete was already in the shelter, and his plan was to stay there for the night as well.
We felt bad for a Phoebe that had somehow managed to build her nest in the shelter. She was desperately trying to get to her nest, but the hikers in the shelter were loud and some were standing, so she couldn't make it in. We ate quickly and decided to push on.
Throughout the day we had our rain gear on at times and off at other times. Our original plan was to camp at the reservoir road campsite area, but when we arrived we realized the site was actually a couple tenths back. Mary wanted to soak her feet, so we went back to the road and found a spot where she could get to the water. Their she stood with her rain jacket on and feet in the cold water of Pedlar River. The decision was made to try to reach Buena Vista where we could hopefully get a ride to a hotel where we could get a hot shower and dry out.
Mary was hiking hard, trying to reach Buena Vista. We were both pretty hungry and she decided to grab a bag of Fritos to eat as she hiked. Bad idea, she inhaled a Frito and was choking and coughing until she was finally able to cough up most of the Frito.
We passed the 800 mile mark today, and previous hikers had ""written"" 800 in Rhododendron flowers at that point along the trail, very nice.
As we hiked by the Brown Mountain Creek Shelter we could see hikers in the shelter as well as many camped in various spots along the river. Some hikers were sitting outside under their umbrellas. We hiked on, and the rain got heavier. We reached US 60 as darkness was falling. We crossed the road and got under the kiosk and put on headlamps so we could call for a ride. Tried calling a shuttle, but no answer. So, we called the E's-y Rider Cab Company. They said they would send someone out if we were sure we would be there. Apparently earlier hikers called them for a ride but must of got a hitch, so they got there only to find no hikers. The driver told us this was her third trip there for the day, and we were the first hikers to actually be there when she arrived. 
We told the cab driver we had called for a room in Buena Vista, The Buena Vista Motel was full and there was one room left at the Budget Inn. We were going to stay at the Budget, however she advised we might be more comfortable in one of the Lexington Hotels, so we headed in that direction while we tried calling hotels to see if we could get a room. Unfortunately, there were graduations going on, so most of the hotels were full. Those that were not full were pricey. We ended up at the Econolodge, unfortunately in a smoking room. So, all our stuff now smells like cigarette smoke combined with a baby powder scent from a spray the cab driver gave us. A very bad combination of smells that we hope we will eventually be able to get out. Mary knew better than to spray any kind of ""air freshener"" as all it does is give her a headache, but she was hoping the baby powder smell would be better than the cigarette smoke.
We hung up our rain gear, took showers, ordered pizza delivery and headed to bed. Our biggest mileage yet, and it is a 1% day as we did 1% of the total trail in one day. We did it carrying a four day resupply as we were not sure how far we would be going and where our next resupply would be.","US 501 (Glasgow, VA)

We didn't get to our room until late last night, so we weren't really wide awake early. It was pouring when we woke, so we weren't very motivated to get going. Had a quick continental breakfast, only to find out there was a restaurant next door we could have gone to for a more enjoyable meal.
We tried calling the E's-y Rider cab for a ride back to the trail, but they were booked until noon. So, we called Three Springs Shuttle and were told they could shuttle us back to the trail. Nancy picked us up, and we chatted as she drove us back to the trail. We told her about E's-y Rider and how they would drive all the way out only to find no hikers to be picked up. She said she and her husband have had the same problem, hikers calling and then apparently getting a hitch and not calling back to let them know they didn't need a shuttle. She also mentioned that we would have some nice views today if the skies cleared. She dropped us off, wished us well, and we were back hiking.
We were tired after such a long day yesterday, and we had a big climb this morning up Bald Knob (which is actually not bald). The weather was not great, and we had our rain gear on, sometimes we could at least get our hood off, but would inevitably need it back on. No views for us today.
Stopped to stretch at Hog Camp Gap and saw a couple day hikers heading out the trail. All in all a pretty uneventful day, but we  were glad to be back on the trail after such a long day yesterday. Happy to have made 14 miles after a late start.","US 60 Buena Vista

Once again it rained off and on all night. And, once again the tent is wet and filthy. It makes it tough to get going when you have to pack up wet gear. Looks like the sun is going to come out, so we are optimistic we can get dried out again.
Not to long into our day we came to Spy Rock which is a short rock scramble to a summit with a 360 degree view. With a little coaxing and hand holding we got Mary to the top. Nomad was already at the top, and we chatted with him a bit. We had some great views and managed to get down with out incident.
Lots of little ups and downs today, but the sun is out so that lightens our spirits. The big thing today is we conquer the Priest, which is a descent from 4,063 feet to 970' at the river, then you immediately start back up to 4,000 feet again. 
We had originally planned to end our day at the Devil's Back Bone Brewery. They will allow you to camp out back, and they have a restaurant to eat at. Sounds like they cater to hikers, letting them camp, shower, and sometimes they will return you to the trail. Unfortunately the terrain won't allow us to make it tonight, so we may try for lunch tomorrow.
About 1/3 of the way down the Priest is a large, open ledge. We decided to stop here for lunch and to dry out our gear. We spent about 45 minutes eating and drying out our tent, fly, rain jackets, pack covers and even our food bags which are supposed to be waterproof but aren't.
We finished the descent to the river where we treated ourselves to a foot/knee soak in the cold water. We thought about going to the brewery from the river parking area, but figured we better just wait until lunch tomorrow and make some more miles. There were several kayakers enjoying the river and we chatted with a few of them.
Started the climb up away from the river and realized it was really hot now. The cool soak sure wore off quickly and we were sweating like crazy. We made our way to Harper's Creek Shelter and decided we were done for the day. Nice, raging river beside our campsite. When we picked our spot another hiker came down to warn us that they had encountered  a rattlesnake when they were looking at the site next to us and it had slithered down toward where we were setting up. We are looking  a little more carefully when we walk around. Ate, and in bed early tonight. Of course we just had a passing shower, so the tent will be wet in the morning again.

The rain let up quickly last night and the tent was actually pretty dry this morning. Packed up and hiking by about 8:00, not bad, but we are rushing to try and make it to Devil's Backbone for lunch. The terrain did not help us today as we still had 2,000 feet of up this morning, and much of it was large rocks. Even though the trail is switch backs, you can't make good time as you climb or hop to the next rock. We finally made the summit after a few stops at the overlooks. Talked with Nomad, he is hoping to go to the brewery as well.
The terrain on the top was still rocky, but once we started going down it became easier. We finally made it to Reeds Gap where you can go to the brewery, and Nomad made a call to see if they could pick us up. At first they said try to hitch, and if we didn't get a ride in 20 minutes they would come get us. After 5 or 10 minutes a woman stopped and picked the 3 of us up. We piled in, each of us holding our packs, and we were off. She mentioned she really likes what Devil's Backbone is doing for the community.
We arrived at the brewery and couldn't believe how big the complex is. They have RV camping, primitive camping, and are building washrooms and showers. They have a stage/pavilion where they do weekend type festivals. They really seem to treat the hikers great. We were seated quickly, and had a safe place to store our packs while we ate. They allow free camping out back and put on a $5 hiker breakfast, then shuttle you back to the trail.
We were tempted to stay, but after we each had a burger and beer, and dessert, we got a ride back to the trail by one of the workers. A very good experience indeed! Nomad decided to stay for the night. We weren't very excited to get back to hiking after such a nice meal in the air conditioning. It was very muggy today, and it looked like thunder showers might be possible. The trail was still all rock slabs for another few miles, so we were full, hot, and slow. We did manage to get another 7 or so miles in to a nice campsite up on Humpback Mountain that actually has a great view. Lots of campers here that we have been seeing the last few days.
All in all it was a good day with a trip to the brewery, and we still got our miles in. Should be in Waynesboro tomorrow, and we should arrive with plenty of time for a good rest and shower.","Harper's Creek Shelter

Shortly after we went to bed it began raining, and it rained off and on most of the night. Early on a thunder storm rolled through and really shook the area a couple of times. Once again everything is wet or damp, but we should be able to dry it out in town.
Mostly a down day with one little climb up out of the last shelter. Mary swore there were a lot of ups as she was pretty tuckered as we finally made it to the road around 3:00. As we were arriving a nasty looking storm was brewing. We got a text from Papa Dale saying hurry to town or seek shelter. We called one of the trail angels, Katz, who does the free shuttling and darted over to the popcorn stand where we were supposed to wait. We were immediately offered a ride from a local, but we couldn't get in touch with Katz to let him know he could cancel. We didn't want Katz to make the drive out for nothing, so we politely declined the ride.
I had a quick hot dog while we watched the sky grow black and the wind and lightning picked up. Our trail angel arrived just as the rain started. As luck would have it, Laugh arrived just as we were getting in and he got a ride to town as well. 
We got a room at the Comfort Inn, which is right across from the Holiday Inn Express where Papa Dale, Brenda, Kingsman, Swimmer and his son are staying. As usual, hectic afternoon of showering, laundry, and a resupply run. I actually ran to WalMart before I got cleaned up to get some things we needed, and while walking back saw an elderly woman t-bone a pickup truck coming through the intersection. It was a pretty nasty hit, so I went over to see if everyone was alright. Talking to the woman, I think she hit the gas instead of the brake as she said the brakes didn't work. But, you could hear the car accelerate through the intersection as it clipped the rear end of the truck. Another gentleman and I helped the occupants out of the vehicles and got them out of the road. Come to find out the other gentleman was a retired police officer. Nobody seemed really hurt, mostly just shaken up by the airbags. So, once the fire and ems arrived on the scene we quickly departed.
Back at the room we made plans to have dinner with Kingsman, Papa Dale, Swimmer and his son. We had a nice meal at Outback Steakhouse and then headed back to WalMart for our resupply. We had picked up some tortillas for Papa Dale, and while we were dropping them off his girlfriend Brenda (""Plus One"") arrived. It was getting late so we headed back to our room to try and get ready for tomorrow. If we don't get everything done we may just zero. The weather is supposed to be nice for the next couple of days so we hope to head out.","Campsite with a view on Humpback Mountain

We slept in until about 7:00 this morning as we both were tired. We have showered and done our laundry, but unfortunately our packs and gear stink so bad that it has stunk up our room pretty bad. We can't open the windows, so we keep the bathroom fan on, but it's not cutting it. I feel bad for housekeeping.
Had our breakfast downstairs and then figured we better get packed up and try to catch a ride to the outfitter where I hope to replace my shoes. We got a ride to the outfitter from a trail angel, but they really don't have the shoes I want. They were kind enough to help me order a pair of North Face Ultra 109's that I was looking for, and they will be shipped to a hostel just on the other side of the park. Very accommodating, and I greatly appreciated their customer service.
Got back on the trail with a ride from another trail angel, ""Yellow Truck"", and we were back off around noon. We really didn't get everything done that we wanted to, but we hated to waste a nice day, so we will just deal with a couple things a while longer. 
The trail was pretty good today, but there is a climb to get into the park. It was quite warm, so we were sweating pretty good. We had our lunch at about 2:00 on the tractor seats that are cemented into the ground like chairs on top of the mountain. Lots of communication towers up there as well.
We got to the shelter and then decided we would move on a few more miles. Pretty good climb up on the ridge, and we were done for. As we were looking for a spot we saw a tent in the trees. Turns out it was Kingsman's tent, and Papa Dale and Brenda are in the same spot. They thought we could squeeze in one more tent, so we decided to join them.
It is a pretty ridge with the Mountain Laurel all in bloom. As I write this a Whippoorwill has been calling for the last 20 minutes straight. Maybe if I shut my headlamp off, he will stop...","Waynesboro, VA

The Whippoorwill never stopped last night, and at times he was louder than others depending on where he was. Every time I woke up, he was still going, only briefly stopping for 10 or 15 seconds.
Everyone was up early, and we all hiked pretty much together to the first shelter 10 miles away. Pretty good clip this morning, and we had ten miles done by lunch. It was nice to hike in the group today as we all got to chat as we hiked. We hiked the miles this morning and there was not water until the shelter and we had run out by the time we arrived. We were glad to make the shelter for some nice spring water.
After lunch we split up a little, but we leap frogged depending on where we stopped. Our goal was to make it to the Loft Mountain Campground where we could grab a coin shower and eat at the store. We eventually all ended up at the campground and were able to share one site for $15, a pretty good deal. We all got showers and had nice grassy sites with picnic tables and bear boxes. We enjoyed some subs and other food from the store and even sampled a couple local beverages. Pretty tired after a long day.","Campsite just before Sawmill Overlook

Up early, and it was nice to eat breakfast at a picnic table. By the time everyone was ready it wasn't too early, but it was nice to all hike together again. We took a little slower pace as Brenda doesn't quite have her trail legs yet (but wow, she's done some big miles right out of the gate!). Nice, leisurely day today. Mary stopped to soak her feet in Ivy Creek today as they were sore. We did make it over the 900 mile mark today.
It was a struggle to get the miles in today because we got trail magic 3 different times. First it was trail magic provided by Snapple and her friend who arrived just as Mary came into the parking lot and threw up her hands and said ""I'm here, where's the Magic?"". The girls had just stopped and had a cooler of soda, chips, apples, rice crispy treats and more. We chatted with them for a while and then reluctantly moved on. Later, as we came down into Simmons Gap to have lunch, ""Snapchat"", who hiked in 2017 was set up. She had applesauce, gatorade, chips and more. We ate our lunch, supplemented with her trail magic and talked for quite a while about the trail. She said when she hiked she was at this spot on this date, and finished her hike on September 1st.
We decided if we didn't get going we wouldn't get to where we wanted to go. We also had trail magic at Powell Gap, gatorade in a cooler. We met a southbound flip flop hiker named ""Penny"". Nice night at the campsite with a great view to enjoy while we had dinner, and later we watched the sun go down. Took lots of pictures trying to capture the beauty of the evening, but I'm sure the pictures won't do the views justice. Also enjoyed chatting with Gene who was out hiking for the day before heading to a family gathering for memorial day.
No cell phone service today, so we couldn't call my sister Sue to wish her a Happy Birthday. We were able to get texts out this morning though.","Loft Mountain Campground

Up pretty early to get started on a planned big day. Some commotion last night as something came through camp making a strange noise. Not really sure what it was. Kingsman said it sounded larger than a deer, so we are thinking it could have been a mother bear with cubs making the noise.
Brenda decided to take a nero today, and is going to catch a ride from Gene. She will jump up to Big Meadows Campground and try to get us a site on this holiday weekend. She hiked down with us until the first gap, and waited for her ride.
We tried to pace ourselves by hiking about 5 miles to the picnic area where we could use the restrooms, stretch, and have a snack. Then we did another 5 1/2 to Lewis Mountain Campground where we grabbed a sandwich, some chips, and a chocolate milk. We met up with Papa Dale & Kingsman there just finishing their lunch, and they told us Brenda had secured a site and we were all set.
By the time we made it to Hazeltop Mountain we were getting tired and struggled to make the last 5 miles. The area around Big Meadow is rocky and Mary's feet were very sore when we finally arrived at the campground. It had sprinkled on and off throughout the day, but as we approached the campground it started to rain a little steadier.
When we finally found our site we were greeted by Brenda with big cheeseburgers she had bought, and they were still warm. She also had beer and Doritos to go along with the burgers. A burger and beer never tasted so good as we sat dripping wet devouring them before we even finished setting up our tent.
After setting up our tent we made our way to the showers to clean up, and then we got our laundry done and made our way back to our site to head to bed.","Campsite at view on Hightop Mountain

Started the day off with the breakfast buffet at the Big Meadows Lodge. It was a nice buffet that included omelettes, waffles, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit and more. Kingsman knew Mary has been hoping for blueberry pancakes and asked one of the workers. They were not doing blueberry pancakes, but gave him a pint of fresh blueberries which he gave to Mary and she enjoyed on a waffle and by themselves.
Back on trail we hiked out near the campground and met some nearby campers who mentioned there had been a mother bear and cubs on the trail every morning recently. Looking off down a hill we spied a couple bears in the distance. Couldn't get any good pictures as they were too far away.
The weather was better today as the skies were clearing. We made it to Skyland Restaurant and Mary and I split a sandwich. Just before getting there Mary had caught her foot on a rock, and the top of her right foot was bothering her. In her frustration she spilled a just opened Frappuccino she bought to go with the sandwich. I went in to get her another one, and hoped to bring her some blackberry ice cream that we heard they had. Unfortunately, they only had vanilla or chocolate, so we will wait for ice cream at another wayside.
We got back on trail and the skies started to look like we might have showers. Kingsman was ahead of us and came upon a rattlesnake beside the trail. He texted us and Papa Dale, but we didn't get the texts. He actually started to hike on but came back to show us the rattlesnake, and we all got some pictures.
As luck would have it, it started to rain and the thunder and lightning started. We were getting drenched as we arrived at Pinnacles Picnic Area. We saw that there was a fire in the fireplace in the pavilion and saw Kingsman waving us in. There was a family who were hoping to enjoy a picnic in the park, but moved into the pavilion and lit a fire to cook on. We all warmed up by the fire and tried to make a plan. There was talk of getting a ride to a nearby hostel or hotel to get out of the rain, but in the end we all decided to move on and hopefully get a spot at Byrds Nest Hut.
We arrived at the hut to find Kingsman had let the hikers there know we were coming. Laugh had moved to the floor of the shelter to make extra room so that Papa Dale, Brenda, Mary and I could set up in the shelter for the night. Kingsman set his tent up nearby. After seeing mice, Laugh also decided to tent. Originally Laugh planned to hike further and not stay at the shelter, however, a large bear was blocking the trail and no matter how much noise he made, the bear would not move off trail.
The night was not restful as we knew there were mice throughout the shelter, but we did stay fairly dry. In the morning there were at least 6 or 7 mice playing ""tag"" along the walls of the shelter. The mice had no fear of the hikers.","Big Meadows Campground

After ""enjoying"" breakfast as we watched the mice ""play"" we packed up and got back on the trail. The plan was to try to make Elkwallow Wayside for lunch. The trail had lots of rocks, and we had some foggy views. Looks like rain all day, but we decided to make the side trail up to Mary's Rock even though we knew the view might not be great. We left hiking poles at the start of the side trail so that the others would know we headed that way. 
At Mary's rock we got some pictures, and Kingsman arrived just as we were getting ready to head back to the trail. He took a picture of Mary and I and then we all headed back to the trail. The rocky trail added to the soreness of Mary's feet, and when we eventually arrived at the wayside Papa Dale & Brenda had already gotten a ride. Kingsman said they had gone to Front Royal. As we were coming up to the wayside we heard air horns blowing and lots of yelling, and we knew that meant they were trying to chase off a bear. We watched figuring they were chasing the bear away from the wayside and towards where we were on the trail. We never did see the bear, but heard about it from other hikers when we arrived. We enjoyed a burger and fries and after we finally got our blackberry ice cream. Mary didn't think the ice cream lived up to all the hype we have heard about how good it was.
Lots of ups and downs today which was tiring. We did manage to make camp before the rain started. We were still full from eating at the wayside, so after setting up the tent we didn't bother with dinner but just had a snack. Rain in the forecast, so off to bed.","Byrds Nest #3 hut

Today's goal was to make it to Terrapin Station Hostel which is where I can pick up my new trail runners. Very humid and sticky today as we hiked along the trail.
We reached the side trail to the hostel and hiked the .7 miles as quickly as possible as the mosquitoes were out in full force. I stayed at this hostel in 2011, and thought it was a nice place to stay. We arrived and found that the yard was overgrown, and when we opened the door Mary knew she wouldn't be able to stay as the bunks are in the downstairs of a split level, and it smelled musty like a basement in need of a dehumidifier. 
I asked the owner if my package had arrived, and he said he hadn't received it but would check today's mail. He came back and told me, ""no package"". I got on the phone with North Face and found out that my order was cancelled. They said when they tried to verify the billing address it didn't match what we gave them. The issue is that in Groton, NH there is no post office. So, when you order online and put in the zip code it comes up as Hebron, NH. You would think that they could have figured this out, but no, they cancelled the order without even calling. They said they could reship the order and have the shoes overnighted. I decided to have them shipped to Harpers Ferry Post Office as that seems like best location based on how far we will hike.
We made the .7 miles back to the trail and continued on. We hadn't had lunch as we originally planned to eat at the hostel, but since we decided to move on that didn't work out. Back on the trail Mary was in the lead and as she was hiking she stopped suddenly and said ""bear"". It wasn't a large bear and it was moving quickly away from us. I told her she was supposed to just stop and quietly let me know that there was a bear so I could get a picture, not yell ""bear"". Still seeing lots of deer, and they seem to just pose and look at you not concerned at all.
There is a trolly that will take you from rt 522 into Front Royal for 50 cents. However, it only picks up twice a day, once at 8:55 am and again at 2:20 pm. We missed the trolly after having to hike to the hostel, so we decided to hitch. Amazingly, two different minivans pulled over at the same time to offer us a ride. We hopped in with a dad who was taking 3 of his children to the local field to fly some planes. I hopped in front and Mary was in the middle row next to a young girl. Mary apologized for being sweaty and smelly to which the girl replied ""That's ok, my dad gets like that a lot"". Great family, and we were dropped off at the Quality Inn which is where Kingsman, Papa Dale & Brenda are staying.
After getting cleaned up and getting our laundry done we enjoyed dinner across the street with Papa Dale, Brenda and Kingsman at the Pave Mint Taphouse and Grill. Had burgers and fries and enjoyed a beer. Happy to have made a few extra miles than planned today as it sets us up better to make it to Harpers Ferry by Saturday before the post office closes.","Gravel Spring Hut

Up early and met Kingsman, Papa Dale and Brenda and had the continental breakfast. Planned to meet at 7:00 am for the shuttle back to the trail.
Headed down the trail and we decided to check out the Jim and Molly Denton shelter. Very nice shelter with solar shower, porch with chairs, horseshoe pit, separate covered pavilion with picnic table and more. Mary stretched under the pavilion as it was starting to rain. A couple girls in long cotton dresses ran in to check out the shelter.
As we were leaving we met a group of Mennonites who are doing a section of the trail. We played leap frog with this group throughout the day.
Had lunch at Manassas Gap Shelter as we needed a privy break and Mary wanted to stretch. Papa Dale, Brenda and Kingsman were sitting at the trail to the shelter having their lunch. They didn't need to make the extra .1 in to the shelter. As we arrived at the shelter we saw TNT and a Biscuit and one other hiker having their lunch. The trail all day has been muddy after all the rain, and the trail to the shelter was extra muddy.
After eating our lunch I went to the spring to get water and Mary headed back toward the trail as she wanted to soak her feet in the stream before resuming our hike. 
We pushed on through the off and on rain and made it to Whiskey Hollow Shelter. Papa Dale and Brenda set up in the shelter, but we were worried about bugs so we set up our tent. Kingsman tented as well. Our plan is to hike the 18 to Bears Den Hostel tomorrow. 
Poison Ivy is starting to show up along both sides of the trail, and with the slippery muddy conditions it is hard trying to avoid the numerous plants as they also climb up the trees.

It rained, and rained hard last night which made a mess of our tent. Dirt splashed all up the side and all over everything in the vestibule on my side. My crocs, pack cover, cookset and poles looked like they have been dragged through the mud. 
Mary had a ""slight"" panic attack last night after being cooped up in the wet, stifling tent with the stench of our shoes and clothing. She felt like she couldn't breath and needed to go outside. (Mary here, I felt like I wanted to run out of the tent, barefoot, and just run, run, run) Of course it was pouring at the time, so she toughed it out and eventually managed to get back to sleep. I know exactly what she is talking about because the same thing happened to me a couple weeks back. Again it was when it was warm, rainy, and everything was buttoned up. I needed to keep opening the screen and getting some fresh air in.
We picked up a wet, muddy tent and went down to the shelter to have breakfast. Apparently mice and bugs were not bad in the shelter last night, and everyone there slept ok. Maybe we should have stayed in the shelter, but we really don't like shelters much. 
The weather settled in, and our plan was to make Bears Den Hostel so we would have a dry night and be able to make Harpers Ferry by Saturday to get my shoes. It was raining, so we put our pack covers on and paced ourselves, trying to work in some stretch breaks.
Papa Dale (No Filter) and Brenda (Plus 1) left before us trying to get an early start as they were going to do the 18 to Bears Den as well. The trail was overgrown and very muddy. It was too warm to hike in rain gear, so shorts/skirt, + t-shirts it was as we trudged through the mud and soaking wet overgrown trail.
We made Rod Hollow shelter for lunch just as Papa Dale and Brenda were finishing their lunch and starting to leave. We ate, got water, and Mary soaked her feet and then we took off back down the trail, soon entering the ""Roller Coaster"". The Roller Coaster is 13.5 miles of short steep ups and downs that aren't as muddy, but pretty rocky. 
We were a ways into the Roller Coaster when we came across ""Homeward"" doing some trail magic. Hot dogs, chips, water and cookies were just what we needed as we were getting tired and still had 6 miles to go. Izzy arrived just before us and Baloo came in shortly after us. Homeward knew we were coming because someone else left a cooler of trail magic just below which was empty. So he would hear the hikers open and slam the cooler as they hoped for some trail magic. Homeward said he hoped Baloo would finish up the hot dogs because a thunderstorm was coming and if the hot dogs were gone he could pack up and head home.
We hustled up the trail with renewed energy hoping to beat the weather. That hope didn't last long, as we reached the 1,000 mile mark the sky darkened and the rain started again. There wasn't much time to celebrate, just a quick shout from Izzy and a good feeling that we had made another milestone. Soon the skies opened up and it poured buckets. Thunder & lightning all around, a couple times too close for comfort!
As we approached the next shelter we were already soaked to the bone and we were afraid if we stopped we would get too cold. The Roller Coaster was now more of a ""Water Coaster"". We soldiered on up the next hill, now hiking in sometimes ankle deep water cascading down the trail. Our previously muddy shoes were now washed clean and would squish water out with every step.
After about 1/2 hour it let up and was just a light rain and the storm was just rumbling in the distance. We didn't let up much, as it seemed another storm may hit us as well. When we came to the creek crossing it was now raging with about half of the rocks for rock hopping under water. It wasn't an issue of keeping our feet dry, just a matter of getting across safely. We steadied ourselves with each step, and slowly made our way over. Baloo had just crossed ahead of us and waited to make sure we crossed safely, and gave Mary some advice on where to step.
It was still a long rocky climb up to the Bears Den Hostel (the kind of trail Mary ""loves""), but we eventually made it to hear a guy leaving in a minivan say ""If you plan on staying you better go inside and take a number, that place is packed!"" When we went inside we found not only was it the usual group of hikers, but also the large group of 17 Mennonite hikers we had been playing leap frog with the last couple of days. When I inquired about bunks the caretaker said he might have one bunk left. When he found out we were a couple he put us down in the intern room which was a small room with a double bed. It worked out better for us as we had a room to ourselves and it didn't smell as much like hiker as the bunkhouse.
We were concerned to learn that Papa Dale & Brenda weren't here yet as they had been ahead of us all day and we didn't pass them. Turns out they went to the last shelter during the storm and then had to struggle with the water crossing that now had no rocks showing. They ended up shimmying over a log to cross. Both were wet and tired when they arrived. Izzy gave up her bunk and slept on the couch and they had one more bunk as well so both had a place to sleep inside. Two other hikers who arrived earlier hoping to get two bunks and then give them to Papa Dale & Brenda were also eventually able to get bunks as the caretaker realized some hikers must have moved around and he had more bunks available then he thought.
We cooked our pizza, and ate our pints of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and started planning our hike for tomorrow. Our feet are really sore from hiking in wet shoes and socks all day. Our plan is to do a normal day of 15 miles and then a short 5 on Saturday to get to the post office by 12:00, or possibly slack the whole 20 miles tomorrow, we haven't decided yet.
The caretaker took over the laundry tonight since the hostel was so full, so we now have clean clothes and socks to start the day tomorrow. Our tent is hanging in a storage room to dry and our shoes are also drying out in the same room.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter (Dick's Dome)

Got up this morning and had tea and enjoyed the ""make your own pancakes"" breakfast. Decided we will just go as far as we can today. Not an early start, we didn't get on trail until 8:30. We still had about 4 miles of the ""Roller Coaster"" left, so more rocky ups and downs. 
We were having trouble getting into a groove today as the terrain was rough and we were worn out from a big, wet day yesterday and the weather this last week which has been hot, humid and rainy. We hiked along and all at once Mary said ""Hey, the state line!"" Just like that Virginia was done and we were in West Virginia. This lightened our mood as we reflected on our 1,000 miles and now we had finally completed Virginia which is 1/4 of the trail in itself. Neither of us said it, but I think we both were thinking it, lets just push on into Harpers Ferry today.
We struggled all day with the footing, if it wasn't muddy it seemed to be rocky with no way to get into a good hiking rhythm. A sign of things to come in Pennsylvania. As the afternoon wore on it was finally verbalized, we were marching into Harpers Ferry tonight. There wasn't a lot of talking, mostly just cursing as we stubbed our toes on rocks or flailed our arms about as we tried to keep the gnats and mosquitoes off our bodies. 
Mile by mile we made our way north until we finally could see the bridge and Harpers Ferry. Like Mary said as we crossed the bridge, ""It seems like people should be cheering us on and waving banners"". Mostly nobody is around, the ATC office closed hours ago and tourists are all at dinner or in hotels. 
We climbed the steep steps of the blue blaze trail off the AT up the hill, through town, and suddenly we were standing at the steps of the ATC, the psychological halfway point. Nobody was around, but we took some pictures of our tired, sweaty, bug bitten bodies in front of the sign. We had arrived at 8:00 pm. Then we decided to head down the road to join Kingsman, Papa Dale (or No Filter), and Brenda for dinner at the Anvil restaurant.
I really reflected today how far Mary has come and how proud of her I am. From the first day when she was worried about the steps at Amicalola to now when she pulled a 20 mile day out of her hat after a very tough 18 miler yesterday. We may not be the fastest, or hike the furthest in a day, but we belong with all the other thru-hikers, and I see no reason why we can't complete this journey.","Bears Den Hostel

We both are pretty sore this morning. Breakfast and then a trip to the ATC for an official check in. We were number 477 & 478 for the NOBO's, and got our picture taken for the book as well as a couple post cards to send home.
After registering we spent about an hour checking who is in front of us, looking at photos and maps, and talking to other thru-hikers. Decided to head to the post office to get my shoes, and arrived only to find out that surprise, they are not here. I call Northface and they tell me that the receiver refused the shipment. I check with the post office and they tell me yes, they don't accept shipments from FedEx. Great, I'm right back to square one. I told them to just cancel the order.
We decided to head to the outfitter to see if they have any hiking shoes. They don't carry Mary's Brooks, and they don't have anything I can use. They tried to sell me Altra's, but I don't think it would be a good idea to start out with zero drop shoes without easing into them. We were able to get new tips for Mary's poles, but we are both stuck with worn out shoes. Mary's have lost all the cushion, so she needs something soon as her feet get very sore on this rocky terrain.
We cheered ourselves up with a pizza and then decided to try to catch up on the journal. Later Papa Dale (now also known as No Filter) and Brenda called and we went out to dinner at the Anvil again. Then back to the room to organize and pack for tomorrow. Once again we zeroed, but I don't feel like we got much rest as we walked all over town trying to get stuff done. Harpers Ferry doesn't have a great place to resupply unless you can get a ride to Walmart 5 miles away. We made do with some resupply from one of the hostels and a convenience store.

Not up any too early today. Made our way down to breakfast where we met Kingsman getting ready to head out. He said his knee was sore but he was going to give it a go. While we had breakfast Papa Dale & Brenda headed out. 
We packed up and headed out stopping at the ATC for a Gatorade where we saw Redhawk and Cribbage checking in. We also made a quick stop off the trail down in town at the outfitter for a few last minute items.
As we started over the Railroad bridge we met a flip-flopper just starting his journey with his girlfriend and parents seeing him off. He was all excited and had nice, clean gear. It made us think back to how far we have come. Shortly it started raining and the wind picked up so we donned our stinky rain gear. We are looking forward to our time off in about a week so we can see family and clean some of our gear and replace some items, namely our shoes.
We headed over the bridge and put West Virginia behind us and entered Maryland. The towpath was nice, but had a lot of puddles to dodge due to all of the recent rain. We soon turned off the towpath and headed up onto the ridge. On the ridge the trail was a mess, deep mud with a trail that doesn't allow water to drain off. Also, the sides of the trail are covered in poison ivy, so if you avoid the mud you risk walking in poison ivy.
We had taken off our rain coats for the climb because we were too hot, but at lunch we put them back on because it was now raining harder and it was getting quite cool. 
The trail today has been the worst we have seen due to the unavoidable mud, and when there wasn't mud there were rocks. When we finally arrived at the shelter we were happy to see Papa Dale & Brenda had already made it there. We were concerned though that Kingsman is not here and we didn't see him all day and neither did Papa Dale. We both have texted him with no response, we hope he is ok.
On a happier note, the shelter is nice and we are sleeping inside as the bugs are not out tonight, and this way our tent can stay dry for a little longer. Our shoes and socks are just caked in mud with no hope of them drying. Our best hope is that our pruney feet dry some and come back to life over night.","Harpers Ferry

Kind of a sad day as Brenda has to make her connection to get to the airport to head back home. She only hiked about 4 miles to the Washington Monument where we had to say goodbye. It was great having her here to hike with, and she will be missed. She will certainly be on our list of newly made friends, and we look forward to seeing her again in the future.
We were glad we stayed in the shelter last night as it poured around 11:30. The trail was a little less muddy today, but the rocks are now increasing. Real slow going in parts. We also realized we have to start eating more during the day. The last few miles we were out of gas, Mary had to stop and get into tomorrows snacks, and by the time I got to camp I was so hungry that I was shaky. We ate immediately once we found a campsite. The problem is most of the dinners we eat might be 500 - 800 calories, and we split them and that is just not enough calories. We'll have to start supplementing our meals with some extras. We hate carrying the extra weight, but we can't function unless we have fuel. We do eat plenty in town (It seems to be all we talk/think about), but it is just not enough.
I forgot to mention that at the Washington Monument, just as we were about to leave, Kingsman arrived. His knee is bothering him, so he pulled up short yesterday. His phone got wet so he was having trouble with it and hadn't received our texts. His wife will be coming to visit for a few days, and he can re-evaluate his hiking plans. He hiked with us most of the day, and we all dried out at Annapolis Rocks, where we saw a group doing some rock climbing and we took some good pictures of the view. We also stopped at Blackrock Cliff for some views.
After a foggy, cloudy start, it cleared up and became a cool, breezy, day which was good for hiking. Just perfect for tenting tonight at the shelter. We are going to try to just go into town for resupply tomorrow and get right back out on the trail. We planned the days out until we will go home and we should make the official halfway point and also make the half gallon challenge before we have to leave. I think Mary has hiked over 1,000 miles just for this challenge. Will try to get an early start tomorrow as we could be delayed by trying to get a ride to town and back to the trail.","Rocky Run Shelter

Awoke early to get going, cool this morning so it should be a good hiking day. We played our food very close this leg, after breakfast Mary has two small bags of trail mix and I have some peanut butter crackers and some M&M's for snacks until we resupply. The only thing left in our food bag is 3 teabags, 3 packets of mustard, and a strawberry jelly packet. Hopefully we make town without much problem.
The trail was pretty good today early on, less mud and the rocks weren't too bad. We had nice views from Raven Rock Cliffs, though it looks like rain may be moving in again. About 3 miles from Pen-Mar Park we went through an extremely rocky section with big slabs to climb on and around. This slowed us down some, but we made Pen-Mar Park and the Mason Dixon Line just before noon. 
Pen-Mar Park is a great spot and if we had food we would have enjoyed lunch there, but instead we headed for the road to hopefully get a ride. We arrived with Papa Dale and Kingsman and decided to split up as we figured no one would pick up four hikers. Mary and I started walking down the road and they were going to follow in 5 minutes. We made it about 2 minutes down the road when a car stopped to give us a lift. As we looked in we saw Kingsman and Papa Dale were already inside. We were all crammed in with our pack on our laps and poles in hand. We were very thankful for the ride, and she was going to Walmart also.
When we arrived we decided to eat lunch at Applebee's first, prior to our resupply. I walked by the Olympia Sports store hoping we may find shoes there. Just our luck, the sign on the door said ""temporarily closed until further notice"". I don't think shoes are in our forecast until we go back home. 
Had a good meal and then headed to Walmart for resupply. As we were outside repackaging the supplies we were offered a ride by two different people. We quickly accepted and hurried to strip the packaging off and jam the food into our food bags. My food bag was so full I couldn't fully close it, but I didn't want to turn down the ride. Mary and I rode with the second offer and Papa Dale & Kingsman took the first offer.
Once back at the trail we tried to do a little more organizing, but the skies began to open up, so we donned our rain gear an jammed the food in our packs and put on our pack cover. The rain didn't last long, and we only had 5 easy miles to the shelter. At the shelter I finally got organized after we set up camp. Tonight I got a chance to call ""Chainsaw"", a hiker friend from my 2011 hike. He will meet us in Boiling Springs and help us get a rental car for our trip home. I really appreciate him helping us out and am looking forward to seeing him again.
Just as we finished our camp chores we heard rumbles of thunder. Papa Dale pulled up the radar on his phone and it doesn't look good. As I write this we have had one good round of storms and it is still raining pretty heavy. Oh yea, the big deal for the day is we are done Maryland and on to Pennsylvania. Of course we are now North of the Mason-Dixon line, so we are practically home!","Ensign Cowell Shelter

Quite a bit of rain last night, but it stopped by morning. Still picking up a soaking wet tent. It's cool so we eat our breakfast in our fleece tops and even start the hike wearing them, but they come off on the first hill. The terrain is not too bad today, but we did have a rocky, steep climb up to Chimney Rocks. The reward for the climb was some great views with some neat rocks to scramble around on. 
We kept a steady pace today because we want to get to Caledonia State Park where Kingsman will be meeting up with his wife for a few days. He and Papa Dale will still slack pack to get their mileage. Nice day as we all stayed together as we hiked and chatted to make the miles go by.
At Caledonia we still had a few minutes before Kingsman's wife was due to arrive so we took the opportunity to dry our tent, ground cloth, and fly. Kingsman and Papa Dale were boiling water for coffee and boiled some extra so Mary and I could enjoy a cup of tea. Mary had her tea while she soaked her feet in the nearby stream, and I went to check to see if the pool, showers, and snack bar were open. Nothing was open as it wasn't a warm and sunny day.
Met Cannonball and Wheat who decided to stealth camp in the back of the park so they could hit the nearby restaurant .5 miles down the road for dinner. We considered going to the restaurant but decided to move on and eat a dinner from our pack. We also met Fluff who was eating dinner at the park before moving on. As we chatted with Fluff a very brazen squirrel kept trying to sneak up to his backpack.
Only a little over 2 miles to Quarry Gap Shelter which is one of the nicer ones on the trail. It is two shelters connected by a pavilion with a picnic table underneath. It also has another picnic table with a covered roof in the yard along with a porch swing, small clothes line, a park bench and another cooking area by the wooden tent platforms, as well as a bear box. The area is very clean and there is crushed stone in the yard and around the fire pit so it doesn't get muddy. Lots of other nice touches such as hanging plants, magazine rack, brooms, shovels, and lots of hooks. 
We opted for a tent platform as we thought it would be buggy. One shelter was already full when we arrived and the occupants are sound asleep even though it is very early still.
We quickly set up, cooked and enjoyed dinner while sitting on the porch swing. Around 8:30 when Mary was already asleep and I was going to bed the boys in the shelter awoke and started carrying on. The story we are hearing is that apparently the 4 boys decided to do a three day hike but their sleeping bags took up too much room in their packs so they only brought light blankets. They brought no sleeping pads or stove either. On their first night out it rained so hard that their Walmart tent leaked and they got wet and started making a fire around midnight to stay warm. When they got the fire going they screamed and hollered because they were so happy and woke the rest of the hikers in camp up. They underestimated the cold, so the plan today was to hike to this shelter and sleep until around 9:00 pm and then get up and hike through the night to stay warm. They had been sleeping since 3:00 in the afternoon. They were very loud, talking, yelling, and chopping wood. After about 45 minutes of them carrying on I couldn't take it any longer. I unzipped the tent and told them that people who had hiked all day were now trying to sleep and we would appreciate it if they would stop burning their plastic trash as it was filling our tent with noxious fumes. And, maybe they could quiet down just a little. To their credit they did say sorry and quieted down. I'm not sure what they said under their breath, but we did finally get to sleep. 
Tomorrow is the official midway point, and the half gallon challenge if we make it that far. Mary is very excited to enjoy a half gallon of ice cream.","Deer Lick Shelter

Woke early to the non-stop song of a whippoorwill right in the camp area. It is amazing how loud they can be. Cold this morning, and I needed to put on my long pants, fleece top and down jacket. 
The trail didn't have a lot of views today, but the footing was good and it was pretty flat so we made good time. We pushed to make the ten miles to the halfway point by lunch as we wanted to eat there. We made it, but no sign, so we pushed on looking for the official sign for quite a while. Finally, we just stopped by a stream for lunch. Fluff was sitting next to the stream enjoying his lunch.  Turns out we were just shy of the Tom's Run Shelter, just about 4 miles past the halfway point and only about 3.6 miles to go to Pine Grove Furnace and the Half Gallon Challenge. So, as Mary soaked her feet in the stream I headed for the picnic table at the shelter to eat lunch. When Mary finished soaking her feet she joined me to have her lunch, and then we headed down the trail.
Shortly after leaving the shelter we came upon Wheat and Cannonball who were at the Midpoint sign, which is actually at the same spot it was in 2011. There is a mailbox there with a log book to sign in on. We got our picture at the sign and signed the log book.
Now we were heading toward Pine Grove Furnace State Park and the half gallon challenge.  We knew Kingsman and Papa Dale were slack packing north about two miles behind us, so we figured we would wait for them once we got to the park.
We arrived at the store to find many hikers were skipping the Ice Cream Challenge and having burgers and fresh cut fries instead. That combo looked delicious, but as a matter of tradition we were committed to eating ice cream.  Mary, myself, Cannonball, and Wheat were all going to do the challenge and we knew Papa Dale wanted to also.   We all decided to wait for the other two to arrive so we could do it together.  Sharon, Kingsman's wife, was already there waiting for him and said they would arrive shortly. 
Once they arrived we all selected our flavors and gathered at the table.  Hershey’s ice cream doesn’t come in half gallon tubs any more, so you have to eat a one and a half quart tub then eat another pint that they scoop into a cup.  I opted for the chocolate tub with a pint of banana  caramel foster.  Mary chose a Neapolitan tub with a black raspberry pint.  We got out our titanium hiking spoons as this was serious business and no wimpy plastic spoon would do.  A timer was set and we were off and eating.  Several strategies were employed.  A couple chose not to purchase the scooped pint in case they couldn’t finish the tub.  Others, like Mary and I chose to get the scooped pint initially as it was softer.  This meant you could power through  the soft stuff and allow the tub to begin to soften.  Everyone started with great gusto, and it was quite a sight as the ice cream was being shoveled in.  At one point as Mary was taking a particularly big bite I was trying to be funny and some how knocked her arm which caused  a big chunk to fall off her spoon and land on her arm and shirt.  We cried foul if she didn’t eat it, which she did, but it also left her arm and shirt covered in chocolate ice cream. 
My money was on Mary, but ultimately Cannonball was fastest with a stunning time of just over 17 minutes.  This came at a price though as he suffered several boughts of painful brain freeze, and seemed to be in actual pain when he finished.  Mary was second with a time of 26 min  02 sec besting my 2011 time by more than a minute and a half.  I was next with a time of 32min 02 sec. 
Both Wheat and Papa Dale finished at a more leisurely pace seeming to take more time to actually enjoy it.  We got some great pictures, and had some laughs doing the challenge, but it’s not something either of us want to repeat in the near future as our stomachs were a bit queasy for some time.The other drawback to the challenge is the cost.  It cost  $20 to buy the ice cream for the both of us. 
We all headed our separate ways after the challenge, some going to the hotel, some to the hostel, and some like us just heading out of the park a couple miles to find a campsite.  We stopped at the bathhouse for the beach and each took a shower and had a slice of pizza to help settle our stomachs before we hiked up the hill and found a campsite.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Nice cool, dry night last night.  We slept with no fly on the tent so we could see the sunset and stars.  Plenty of bugs, so I’m thankful for all the no-see-um netting.  As soon as we climbed into our bags last night we heard footsteps in the leaves  and saw a deer just outside our tent. The crinkling of my air matters startled him, and he bounded several feet away.  He stood and watched us for some time, craning his neck and pawing at the ground wondering what we were. 
Because our mileage has been so good the last couple of days we are ahead of where we thought we would be, so we decided to try to make Boiling Springs today, and then try to get a few more miles tomorrow before we have to leave for home. 
We have plenty of dinners left but no lunches, so our plan was to hike into the Green Mountain Store about six miles down the trail and have lunch. The trail is very smooth today and mostly flat, so we made good time to the store where we met Cannonball and Wheat doing the same thing.  It was before 11:00, but we had lunch  anyway.
The afternoon hike was a little more challenging as we had some rocky terrain in an area they call the rock maze.  It’s basically a rocky ridge that navigates around some rocks and over others. The maze slowed us some, but once we got over that we started down into the Cumberland gap. We cruised into boiling springs navigating the cornfields for the last mile or so hoping to get a shower before the the town pool closes. We arrived at the turnoff to the free camping area and decided to try and get a shower and something to eat before we set up.
The town pool allows you to shower for 2 dollars, and this is a price we gladly paid to get cleaned up after a hot sweaty day.  We took turns showering and watching the packs then decided to head  over to the tavern for dinner.  When we arrived they were very busy, so we decided to try to find seats at the bar.  As we started to enter we were told to leave our packs outside, which is what we planned to do but were inquiring where they wanted us to put them where they would be safe. We were told to leave them up against the building behind the shrubs. Not a great spot, but at least people wouldn’t mess with them.  When we entered the bar we found two vacant seats but they weren’t together.  Suddenly a table opened up and we asked if we could have it and were told the tables were all reserved, and that they were busy and we should check out front.  When we inquired out front if they had any seats we were told there was nothing available.  No offer to put our names on the list, so we got the feeling we really weren’t welcome. 
We grabbed our stuff and headed down the street to the pizza shop where we had a couple of sandwiches.  We couldn’t get a beer though as the only place in town with beer was the tavern. After dinner we walked back to the camping area to set up our tent.   Once again, just like on the trail, there is lots of poison ivy. So we chose our site carefully.  Cannonball, Wheat, Fluff, and several other hikers are all here tonight. Hopefully we will get some sleep as the bugs are bad and the train tracks run right by the site.  We have already had several trains go by this evening.  Tomorrow will be our last day hiking before we go home for some family commitments.  It should be a short flat day","Campsite North of Pine Grove State Park

Woke early and ate breakfast in our tent because the bugs were so bad. Breakfast consisted of a muffin for Mary and a danish for me that we purchased at the convenience store last night. Neither item tasted very good. We slept as well as possible considering we were right next to the train tracks and several trains went through during the night.
We had hoped to leave our packs at the ATC headquarters and slack pack to Carlisle, as we are coming back to Boiling Springs to meet Chainsaw. We thought the ATC opened at 8:00, so we decided to check out Cafe 101 while we waited for them to open. We split a skillet breakfast at the cafe and each enjoyed a cup of tea. Fluff was also at the cafe, and Wheat showed up just as we were leaving.
Back at the ATC we found that they will not be open until 9:00 or 10:00, so we decided to just get back on the trail. Kingsman's wife stopped in as we were getting ready to head out, and we chatted with her for a bit.
Mostly flat trail with lots of poison ivy lining both sides. We made good time, even though at one point we thought maybe we were under attack as we hiked past some sort of shooting range that was particularly active this Saturday morning. We arrived in Carlisle just after 11:00 and decided to walk down the road to the diner for lunch before getting picked up by Enterprise to get our rental car.
After enjoying lunch, I called Enterprise to let them know we were early, and ready to be picked up. Unfortunately, there was no one available until possibly 2:00 to pick us up. We headed to the Flying J to do some laundry and possibly get a shower. At $12 a shower, we opted to just do our laundry as we both had a shower last night.
Just as our laundry finished drying I got the call from Enterprise that they were outside waiting to give us a ride back to get our rental. Getting the rental went smoothly, but getting directions back to Boiling Springs was a little more time consuming. With printed directions in our hand we headed to Boiling Springs. Mary texted Chainsaw to let him know we were on our way.
We arrived back at the ATC and found Chainsaw waiting for us. After catching up, he asked if we wanted to go eat. We said we'd love to get some dinner, and he said how about the tavern. We jokingly said, ""If we can get in"" and told him about our attempt to eat at the tavern last night. We walked to the tavern, which was not very busy at 3:30 in the afternoon and took seats at the bar. The bar tender took our drink orders and overheard us talking about the trail. He asked ""Oh, are you thru-hiking the trail"", to which we replied yes. He then proceeded to tell us how hiker friendly the tavern is... We have places you can charge your phones and devices, you can fill your water, the bathrooms are right around the corner, etc etc. What a difference from last night.
Chainsaw treated us to a yummy dinner, and Mary & I enjoyed a beer. It was great catching up and reminiscing with Chainsaw about our hike in 2011 and Mary's and my current hike. After dinner we walked back to the ATC, got a picture with Chainsaw next to the building under the sign, and it was time for Mary and I to hit the road and head to New Hampshire.
We will be off trail for a week, and can't wait to get back to the trail and continue North. 
Thanks again to Chainsaw for coming to visit, a wonderful meal, and help with getting a rental car.","Backpackers campground in Boiling Springs

We slept in today because our car didn't have to be back to the rental agency until 12:00. We had a quick breakfast down at the hotel’s continental breakfast, then we rode by car down to Walmart and did our resupply, by that time it was nearly noon.We hustled back to the car rental agency, arriving right at noon and were back on the trail by 12:30. 
Very hot today, I think up in the high 90s when we got going on the trail. A lot of open fields, so we felt like slugs in the heat.  I think eating too much in town and not enough exercise the last few days had us moving very slow and sluggish.  
We had a quick lunch at the Scott farm house and then headed up to the top of the hill to the Darlington shelter where we decided to stay for the night. It's supposed to be hotter tomorrow so we're going to try to get up really early and get into Duncannon by 11:00 tomorrow.  We're in camp early tonight and will probably go to bed early and try to get up really early to beat the heat. 
As we were making camp we met a new hiker whose name is Honey Bun. He's from England and we were asking him about people he may have come by. We were curious about a group that had been a couple of days back and we were wondering if he had come across them. He thought some of the gang was only 2 or 3 days ahead. Lo and behold a short time later in comes that gang.  Sourpatch, Knotty boy and Ducky had all gotten off trail for a few days also. So we're hiking with them again which is kind of nice.

Well I've been bragging about my Neo-air, but it finally let me down. I had to get up last night about 4 times to reinflate it, so it must have a small leak. Needless to say with the heat and humidity and the pad going down, we didn't get much sleep. 
We tried to get up early today to beat the heat, but it really didn't matter. By 9:30 the sweat was dripping off our noses as we hiked. We thought we might make it into Duncannon to have lunch at the Doyle, but with the heat , humidity and the terrain, we didn't get in town until almost 1:00. 
Just as we arrived, the bartender told us that the kitchen was closed because the cook had an appointment. So we grabbed a quick beer and discussed what we were going to do. We decided we couldn't wait, so we left and headed down the street to the pizza place, but on the way we saw the pub and that looked good so we stopped in there. We enjoyed a burger and had another beer while hoping to wait out the heat. 
We decided to prolong hiking out of town by going down to get an ice cream. On the way down we asked for directions at the church, and a couple of guys told us it was right down the street. They also mentioned that they hosted hikers downstairs, and they had a shower too.
 We had our ice cream and headed back to the church for a shower, as a shower today was too hard to resist. The church hostel was really nice, especially since they had air conditioning. It was clean and they had a beautiful shower. We took a shower then sat enjoying the air conditioning, trying to avoid hiking out of town.
 We met a thru hiker named Butter for the first time, she was taking a zero while she was waiting for her  new shoes. A few other hikers came in to get out of the heat as well. We decided to head out, and most of the hikers said why don't you guys stay, it's  too hot to hike today. 
We decided to go, and as we walked the mile or so out of town we soon regretted it. Once again, even though it is nearly 5:00, the heat and humidity took it toll and we were exhausted. We still had 3 miles to go and most of it was uphill, so we had to take a few breaks just to make it to the top.
 It was nearly dark when we arrived at camp. We gathered a bucket of water and tried to clean up as best we could, but we knew we were going to be in for another long, hot, sweaty night. Honey Bun came in even later than we did looking for water, and it was so dark that he just crashed in the shelter. 
It might rain tonight, so hopefully that will cool things off for tomorrow.  Off to bed, hopefully we'll get some sleep and have a better day tomorrow.","Darlington Shelter

It rained last night, and again this morning, so we hung out in our tent until it stopped. Around 7:00 it was just dropping off the trees, so we got up, packed the gear and headed out.
Shortly into the day we were passed by Murph and Taylor. As we were talking to them we realized they were the ones who were camped down below us last night. They were hammocking just down below us and we didn't realize it. We thought they would have been far ahead by now. It's nice to have more familiar faces around. We have  hiked around them since Franklin North Carolina.
By the time we made it to Peters Mountain shelter the sun had come out, so we decided to stop for lunch and to dry our tent out. Murph and Taylor were already in the shelter eating lunch, so we had company while we ate. We took a long lunch as our stuff dried, so we had plenty of time to chat with them, as well as several other hikers that came in for lunch. After the tent dried we headed down the trail again.
The rocks were tougher in this area so Mary's feet are very sore. She stopped several times today to soak her feet, trying to get the swelling to go down. 
Later in the day as we were getting water, in rolls Butter. She had come from Duncannon, and was planning to go a few more miles. She bounded off down the trail as we debated how much further we should go. We decided to push on a couple more miles to a campsite listed. When we arrived we found Butter was there, and already set up. We set up beside her, and had a good time talking to her while we all ate dinner.
Shortly before we went to bed up the trail comes a group of a hikers called the Swiss Family Robinson. They consist of two Swiss, a German, and a Colombian, we think. Their  trail names are Santa Claus, Hook, Translator, and Da-who. They seem very high energy, and look to be having lots of fun. They were doing 24 miles out of town and figured they wouldn't arrive at camp until about 9:30. They also plan on averaging 22 miles for the rest of the hike so they can have a leeway of 11 zeros at the end.
It’s cooling down tonight, so if I don't have to inflate my pad too many times, hopefully I can get a better night sleep.

I finally  got A good night sleep last night as it cooled down enough to get under the covers. We got up around 6:15 and were on the trail by 7:20. We took the time to have tea this  morning because it wasn’t raining yet. We thought it may rain last night, and it did sprinkle, but it was pretty clear this morning and it looks like the rain will hold off until noon. 
The trail wasn’t too rocky this morning, but Mary's feet and legs were sore almost from the get go.  She soldiered on, stopping to stretch when we had a chance. We made it to Roche Gap shelter, but because it was three tenths off the trail, we decided not to go in. Instead we headed down to the stream to eat lunch and soak Mary's feet. Butter came in as we were leaving and she headed to the stream to get some water also. 
Just as we were getting ready to leave it started to rain, so we put our pack covers and rain jackets on and headed out. Soon after we left we met up with a Boy Scout Troop that told us be ready for a nasty, muddy water crossing. They weren't kidding! Soon we came to a wet area about a hundred yards long that was solid mud. I managed to walk on some sticks and take a long detour around and kept my feet mostly dry. Mary decided to put on her Crocs and walk right straight thru, she said it wasn't that great a feeling. 
Near the end of the day we crossed a couple more roads, then we had to walk underneath I-81. It was looking more and more like rain so we wanted to find a campsite. The problem was, once you go underneath I-81 the trail is really rocky, and it's a steep uphill with very few campsites. 
We made it to the first campsite we could find that was level and quickly set up our tent and ate. Later, Stoic came in. We  haven't seen him in quite a while. He set up his tent just on the other side of the trail.
 Shortly after we climbed into bed it began to rain, so we were happy we made it in time and didn't get wet. Tomorrow we're hoping it'll be a decent day and we'll make it to the 501 shelter where we can order some pizza.","Campsite near spring

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595668,"DAY 107It was raining when we woke up this morning, so we slept in a little waiting for the rain to stop. It's been so humid lately, and with us sweating so much, it was very uncomfortable sleeping last night. 
The trail continues to get rockier and we've been struggling up on the ridge with the rocks tenderizing our feet. We planned to make it to the William Penn shelter for lunch, but to our surprise just as we approached the shelter we looked up and saw a section hiker, who hiked a section of the trail this spring, doing trail magic. He and his brother had snacks, drinks, and chips, and were in the process of making a fire to cook hot dogs. We stopped for probably 45 minutes talking to the other hikers as they came in. We are hoping Butter will make it in. We just passed her tent and it was about 11 and she was still sleeping in, so we are hoping she will  get there before he closes up. 
We still had several miles to go before the 501 shelter, but most of all we are looking forward to a shower there. The trail is rocky again, so it took us a while to get there.
 Ultimately we decided we better push on, so we took a quick solar shower, and when I say solar what I really mean is a cold shower. Nonetheless, it felt pretty good. After our showers  we ordered pizza, and because we're running low on resupply we decided we'd order some pierogies to pack out for tomorrow's breakfast. 
We ate what we could of the pizza, and packed the rest up. Then we headed out for another 5 miles. We hiked until nearly dark, and quickly found a campsite. There is small dammed pond here that you are supposed to be able to go swimming in, so we went down to check it out and do a quick rinse off before bed.
It's a little cooler tonight, but it doesn’t look like rain, so we're sleeping with the fly off.","Campsite at 1184.6

Woke up this morning after sleeping pretty well other than my mattress deflating a few times. We ate our pierogies for breakfast, which were actually pretty good. We packed up our snacks, which will hopefully get us to town.
 Mary decided she wanted to soak her feet and knees again, so we headed down to the pond for one more soak. When I was on the dam taking pictures, I turned around just in time to see Mary stumble and nearly fall into the water clothes and all.
 At some point during the day we decided we should try to get into town tonight as rain was forecast for this evening and tomorrow morning. We hiked steady throughout the day taking a few breaks to give Mary's feet and knees a rest. A lot of hikers had the same idea, as many of them passed us on their way to town including Ducky, Knotty Boy and Sourpatch. 
As we neared town Mary ran out of gas and we had to pull over at a small campsite and make our dinner of potatoes and chicken. Dinner just gave her enough energy to make the remaining miles into town. Unfortunately, the last mile is a very steep downhill which really took its toll on her knees and feet.
As we finally got down the hill to the railroad station, we met another thru hiker named Flip. He asked us when we started the trail, and when we told him March 7th, he said he and his brother Meatloaf had started that same day. We thought it was interesting that we had never met until today.
 We elected to stay at the nearby motel rather than stay at the Pavilion for the night, but we needed to get a ride over to the motel. Cabela's normally does a shuttle, but it was almost closing time, so we called a shuttler to give us a ride to the motel. The shuttler was great. He works on donations only and brought us right to the motel, and we were really happy to be there.
 We quickly checked in then gathered up our laundry and loaded that in the wash and headed down to Pappy T's, the attached restaurant, for another dinner. I had a burger and Mary had a meatball sub. We each enjoyed a beer, then we finished our laundry. Now off to bed after a long day. 
Tomorrow we will go to Cabela's to see about a new pad or getting mine fixed, then we'll head over to Walmart to do our resupply. It's nearly 11 now so we better get to bed as we’ve got another big day tomorrow.","Hertline campsite

We didn't get up too early after a long day yesterday, and a late night last night. Fortunately check out time was 12 noon, and we ended up needing all of that time. 
We had a quick cup of tea and breakfast at the motels continental breakfast. After breakfast we decided to walk over to Cabela's to see if they could do anything with my air mattress. Even though you can see Cabela's from the motel it's quite a walk as you have to cross a busy highway and several other parking lots. We  arrived about 10 minutes before they opened and there were already 30 or so people waiting at the doors as we got there. 
When they opened we went upstairs to the camping department where I checked out the price of new air mattresses. Once I saw the price I decided that I better see if I can fix mine before I buy a new one.
 I approached two women working in the camping department, and asked if they could help me try to figure out where my mattress was leaking. They looked at me like I had two heads, saying they have no way of testing anything. When I asked if they had some water or something that I could try to find the leak they directed to me the bathroom, telling me I could get some water there. I just thanked them and moved on.
 I tried again with the greeter at the front of the store, asking if there was any way they might be able to test the mattress. When I told him I was looking for a tub or a pool of something to put the mattress in to test it, he suggested maybe the fishing pond out front. Frustrated, we left Cabela's and headed to Walmart to do a resupply,
 Walmart was within seeing distance, but it takes you about 15 minutes to walk there when you go through all the parking lots and connecting roads.
 With our resupply done we headed back to the motel to check out. We realized when we got back that we didn't have much time, so we quickly tried to get all of our gear together. Soon housekeeping was knocking on our door, and we told them just a minute and would be right out. 
We finished packing our resupply up in the lobby where a lot of other thru-hikers were watching the World Cup soccer match. Red Panda, Sherpa, Knotty Boy and Sourpatch were all there watching the game along with several other hikers, most of them were zeroing waiting on another hiker to celebrate his 30th birthday.
 We weren't sure how we were going to get back to the trail, but we heard Cabela's offers to shuttle hikers back, so we headed up again in that direction. We decided to stop at Red Robin for a burger before we headed out. 
At Cabela's a couple other hikers were waiting for the shuttle, and it seems they are having trouble finding the keys or even the vehicle that was supposed to be used for shuttles. Once they found the keys we did get shuttled back to the trailhead.
 Soon we were on our way. Of course our packs are heavy and we have a very steep up heading out of town. With full bellies, a steep uphill, and rainy, humid weather we went very slowly.
 We only went a few miles to the first shelter and decided to call it quits for the day. We were surprised to see Taylor and Murph, they're also camping.
 I did blow up my mattress and bring it down to the nearby stream to see if I could find the leak, I had no luck, and now my NeoAir is all wet.
 Later in the evening we heard a couple of day hikers come in and set up in the shelter. They made quite a commotion as they were setting up and preparing for the night. 
They say this is when Pennsylvania rocks really start, so we'll see what tomorrow brings.","Port Clinton

The plan was to get up early and get going because we knew we had a lot of rocks coming up. That didn't happen for a couple of reasons. First, it rained last night so we weren't very motivated to pick up a wet tent. Second we had slugs all over the tent, so it took us quite a while flicking the slugs off with a stick.
 When we finally got picked up we went up to the shelter and had breakfast with Murph & Taylor. Apparently a couple of guys came into the shelter last night and set up a brand new tent still in the box right inside the shelter. After they set up the tent they proceeded to spray bug spray all over the shelter,  so much so that one of them ended up puking. They were still in the shelter this morning when we were trying to eat our breakfast.
 After they left, we noticed they left a bunch of trash and stuff out in front of the shelter. Murph actually grabbed some of their trash to pack out, which was a nice thing for her to do.
 We never left the shelter until 9:00 as we had trouble finding our groove this morning. We made stops at Pulpit Rock and the Observatory, and then hiked on to the Pinnacle. By that time it was getting on towards lunch time. 
We hadn’t made many miles, but we were so hungry by the time we stopped for water that we decided we better just eat right there. After we ate lunch and had a drink, hiking was a little easier and we decided to head for Eckville shelter to see if we could get a quick solar shower. 
Just as we came to the turn for the shelter we saw a bunch of cars and people in the road.  At first we thought it was trail magic, but we soon learned it was the support crew for Harvey Lewis. He is trying to do the fastest time on the Appalachian Trail. 
Harvey’s dad leads the support crew, and he gave String Cheese and Broken Seal each a nectarine. String Cheese was nice enough to give us one of the nectarines to share and she and Broken Seal shared the other. We also each received a cold soda. The nectarine sure tasted great. 
We had seen a group of hikers go by when we were out at the Pinnacle, and wondered why they didn't come out for the view. After meeting Harvey Lewis' crew, we realized it was him going by. He obviously doesn't take time out to go out for the views, as he is trying hard to set a new record for a supported thru-hike
 We headed down the road to Eckville shelter with String Cheese and Broken Seal. When we arrived at the shelter we saw Maple Leaf and her dog Marshmallow. Butter came in later. There was another thru hiker there named Ben.
We sat at the picnic table and ate our lunch, and then Mary and I each enjoyed a solar shower.  The shower wasn't exactly warm, but was certainly appreciated on such a hot day. 
 When we were leaving we saw Hard Hat coming down the road to the shelter. He is the thru hiker we met as we were leaving Harpers Ferry. He's doing a flip flop hike.
We stopped at Dan's pulpit, and Butter was already there. We had her take our picture with the Baysider newspaper. We took a little time to read the hiking log that was in the mailbox there.
When we finally arrived at Allentown Hiking Club shelter it was almost dark. Taylor,  Murph, Butter, String Cheese, Broken Seal and Ben were already there. We quickly set up our tent, and ate what was to be our lunch tomorrow for dinner, so we wouldn't have to cook.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

Even though we had a late night we still got up early because we knew we had another rocky day ahead. As a matter of fact, String Cheese commented later that she was embarrassed to be laying in the shelter when we were already up and getting ready for the day.
 It was about a quarter mile downhill for water, so I made the trek while Mary finished picking up camp and made breakfast. 
Once again the footing varied from semi smooth to patches of rocks where you couldn't get a good rhythm going at all. We arrived at Bake Oven Knob and we're surprised to see all the graffiti. It’s such a beautiful place, one of the best overlooks on the trail, marred by tons and tons of graffiti.
 It was hot out on the rocks so we decided to hike down to the parking lot to eat our mac and cheese we were supposed to eat last night for dinner. As we arrived at the parking lot we could see a sign that read “trail magic - it's a party.” A couple of Easy Ups full of lawn chairs, food, drinks and snacks. The trail magic was being done by a couple of thru-hikers from 2016, (the Conrad’s) Chopper and Billy Goat, and their wives .
 They know how to do it up right.  They were grilling hot dogs and hamburgers to go with tons of chips, snacks, candy bars, and fresh fruit; everything that a thru hiker wanted. It was just what we needed on a day we were going to have to eat our dinner for lunch. We stayed about 45 minutes and enjoyed the company of the other thru hikers (Murph, Taylor, Easily Forgotten, Bunny Tracks,) and the Conrad's. Izzy was just leaving when we arrived, and a couple of German hikers came in as we were leaving.
 We weren't sure where we were going  to camp tonight, we could either go into Palmerton Pennsylvania or pull up just short. It was getting late as we started the long downhill into town. We tried calling the hostel, but got no answer. We didn't want to go into town if we didn't have a place to stay, because if we had to hike out that meant a long, tough climb out of town with no place to camp for quite some time. 
We called a motel in a nearby town as well as a clothing optional resort that was listed in the book, but all of them wanted us to find our own way in, and it was quite a distance to go. Finally we decided let's just go for it and head for Palmerton.
We made it to the road crossing and walked to the ABC parking lot where we might be able to get a ride. We waited a short time with no luck, but finally a woman stopped and offered us a ride. Debbie brought us right to the hostel. We tried the door, but no luck. We were wondering what we should do when she offered to let us spend the night at her house as she has an extra room. We hesitated a moment, and just then String Cheese came around the corner and said ""oh great, we hoped you guys would make it in"". We quickly thanked Debbie and then String Cheese showed us around the hostel. They still had a couple bunks left, thankfully. 
 We went up the street and grabbed an ice cream just before they closed at 9. Then we started our laundry and each grabbed a shower. Easily forgotten and Bunny Tracks were also staying there and they went up the street to have ice cream with us. Fuji, another hiker, is also staying here tonight.
 We took a chance, and thankfully everything worked out. Tomorrow is the big climb up Lehigh gap, the big rock climb you see in the all the magazines. Mary's not really looking forward to it, but it has to be done.
 The hostel we are at is actually a restaurant that has some bunks out back, and in the morning after breakfast the owner will bring bring us back to the trail.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Everyone was up pretty early in the hostel wanting to get going today. We were at the restaurant at 7:00 just as it opened. After a nice hearty breakfast the other hikers got shuttled back to the trail, but Mary and I still had to do a resupply, so we walked down to the market that opened at 9. When we got back after our resupply Bert's wife shuttled us back to the trailhead.
 Today's hike is Infamous for a couple of reasons. One, you have Lehigh gap which is a jumble of steep boulders you must climb on the way up to the ridge. Second, once you get up on the ridge you immediately enter the Superfund Site, this is a ridge that was denuded from a zinc smelting operation, and now they're trying to restore it. And third, it is a long ridge with no water. There is one emergency spring, but it's contaminated so they only recommend you drink out of it in an emergency. 
It's a hot day so we know we're going to be in for a long hike today. Mary wasn't too thrilled with the climb up over the boulders. In some places it is a hand-over-hand scramble. There were a few curse words uttered and some tears were shed, but eventually we both made it up over there unscathed. 
Once up on the ridge the beginning of the Superfund Site is really quite smooth and we made pretty good time. We met a dad out hiking with his two young daughters, they brought some goodies for any thru-hikers they may meet. Mary felt obligated to take a little apple sauce packet. 
Once we got down off the Superfund Ridge the trail got considerably more rocky and tougher going, it didn't help that it was so hot today. We struggled along and eventually made it to the  Leroy Smith Shelter. There is a spring at the shelter, but the water's probably a quarter mile down hill.
 Easily Forgotten and Bunny Tracks were in the shelter, but it seemed too buggy so we tented up on the hill with Stoic, even though it may rain tonight.","Palmerton (Bert's Steak House Hostel)

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596427,"DAY 113Today wasn't really an eventful day, more of the same really, mostly rocks with little or no views.
 When we woke it wasn't raining yet but it looked like it was threatening so we quickly had breakfast and picked up our gear. Soon after we got hiking it started to sprinkle so we put on our rain gear, but it was so humid and warm that we were sweating in it. It's one of those days where you put your hood up then you take your hood down. You unzip it then zip your jacket back up. Nothing seems to be very comfortable. 
At one point today it started to rain pretty hard, so that gave me a chance to use my new fashionable rain skirt. Rain skirts seem to be pretty popular as they keep the rain off your legs, but are cooler than rain pants as air is allowed to get up underneath. I wasn't sure whether I really would like one, so I decided to fashion my own out of a compactor trash bag. I basically cut the bottom off a trash bag so you can step into it then I tuck the bag into my shorts. It actually seems to work pretty good, so Mary thinks I'm quite a sight as I'm walking down the trail. 
We got to the Kirkridge Shelter just before a thunderstorm rolled through. We sat inside with Flip while he  waitied for his brother. We originally planned to tent, but after we looked at the tent sites filled with poison ivy and heard the thunder, we decided it would be better to just sleep in the shelter. We set up in the shelter and soon after Meatloaf, who is Flip’s brother, arrived looking pretty wet from the downpour. They were setting up in the shelter also when Easily Forgotten and Bunny Tracks arrived. They had a tough day also as Bunny Tracks slipped on some rocks and cut her wrist. 
We head to Delaware Water Gap tomorrow. We are hoping the bugs won't be bad and the rain won't blow in the shelter so we can get some sleep.","Leroy Smith Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596428,"DAY 114We are glad we chose to stay in the shelter last night as a thunderstorm rolled  in and it rained hard several times. The bugs were not too bad, and no one seemed to snore, so we got a pretty good night's sleep except for one incident. At one point a mouse crawled through Mary's hair and then crawled across my stomach. Nonetheless our gear stayed mostly dry, so we are happy about that. 
We hope to make it into town by 10:30 to get a second breakfast at the bakery. We started out with our rain gear on because everything was so wet, but soon took it off as it was too humid. The trail started rocky, but soon turned to an old tote road, so we made pretty good time except when trying to avoid the puddles from the rain last night. 
As we got close to town the trail became steep and the rocks were wet from last night's rain, this slowed us down a little and we ended up getting into town around 11. We hung some of our damp things at the hostel and then went down to the bakery to have lunch. We had a sandwich on homemade bread followed by pie ala mode, both were very good.
 While we were eating it began to rain, fortunately some of the hikers at the hostel put our gear undercover. When we got back we decided we wanted to do a resupply and do our laundry. The best place is over in East Strasburg, Pennsylvania, so we decided to call a shuttle to get us there. The church does the hiker feed tonight, so we had to hustle to get our stuff done before 6 when they start the potluck dinner. We got back with just enough time to organize our stuff before the church was calling us for dinner.
Feeding the hikers is something the church has been doing for 40 years. During thru hiking season every Thursday they cook up some hot dogs and hamburgers and then a lot of members bring in a potluck dish. Then the hikers all mingle in with the church members and everyone chats and has a nice meal. It's great for the hikers because it's such a variety of dishes including dessert, and when the meal is done they put all the leftovers down at the hostel so hikers can eat it later.
 After dinner we sat outside a little bit where it was cool. It is probably going to be hot in the hostel tonight as there's no air conditioning. Excited to officially get out of Pennsylvania tomorrow and into New Jersey.","Kirkridge Shelter

We were up pretty early and packed up as quietly as we could. The local bakery opened at 8, so once we were ready we headed there. We each ordered a hot tea and a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. Of course they also have cinnamon buns, so we each ordered one of those as well. We were certainly full as we put our packs on and headed back toward the trail.
We were excited to get back on the trail today, because once we cross the Delaware we will be out of Pennsylvania. As we crossed the bridge, it would actually move as the big trucks drove along beside us.
We were stopped at a rest area just after the bridge when Taylor hiked in. We crossed under I-80 and then headed back into the woods.
It's about a three-and-a-half mile hike into Sunfish Pond, and we stopped to stretch just before the pond. When we were stopped stretching, some day hikers came along. We talked to them for a bit and learned that the younger girl had done a section of the AT in 2015. Her trail name was Derp. When she heard my trail name is Earl Grey we learned that's her favorite tea. And when Mary introduced herself as Purple Haze, she said that's a good beer.
Deluxe, Murph, The Godfather, Flip, and Meatloaf came along just as we were finishing stretching.
The Trail goes along the side of the pond for quite a while, and we saw several frogs as well as a water snake swimming in the pond. As we were standing by the pond looking at an exceptionally large tadpole a Ridge Runner named Sugar Magnolia came, she stopped to chat and we inquired what those large tadpoles were. She told us they were bullfrog tadpoles.
 As we hiked along the ridge, we enjoyed some blueberries as well as the views. When we came to the trail to the Mohican Outdoor Center, we decided we'd go in and enjoy cold drink and lunch. We each got a Peak iced tea and were happy to receive a cup of ice to go along with them. We brought our food bags in and made peanut butter and fluff sandwiches, and enjoyed some time relaxing on the couch.
I inquired about the lake, and was told by one of the workers that he swims in the lake every morning. So, we decided to go down and enjoy a swim. The water was quite warm, and we were able to get right in. But it was still very refreshing.
After enjoying our swim, we decided we better get back on the trail and get a few more miles in. We hope to get up early tomorrow and start hiking before the heat and humidity kicks in.
 When we got back to where the trail goes back into the woods, there was Butter sitting beside the trail. We talked to her for a few minutes and then headed on up the trail. Tonight we are camping at a nice site all by ourselves.
So far New Jersey has been a Wildlife mecca. Today Mary almost stepped on one snake and then a little further down the trail she nearly put her pole down on a rattlesnake. Also, just as we came down off the ridge tonight we spotted a bear up on the rattlesnake trail. We also saw several bunnies today.","Delaware Water Gap

We got up had tea, and I enjoyed a bowl of cereal and Mary enjoyed her pop-tarts. We were on the trail by just after 6 a.m.
We did about 6 miles before we took our first pack off break up on the ridge.
We got to Mountain House Tavern around 2:45. The first thing we ordered was a glass of ice water for each of us. Then we ordered a Lagunitas IPA. Mary had a salad with steak on it and I enjoy the bacon burger and fries. We headed outside but it was so hot we decided to go back in and enjoy the air conditioning and some dessert. We split a piece of carrot cake.
We couldn't put it off at any longer and headed back to the trail. It was hot, humid and extremely buggy. We made it to Gren Anderson Shelter and quickly set up our tent as the mosquitoes were vicious. We tried to quickly clean off with some water from the spring, and now we are laying in our tent as the mosquitoes buzz outside.","Stealth Campsite

Neither of us got much sleep last night even though we tried rinsing off. We were both still sticky and hot all night long. The mosquitoes were vicious last night, we could hear buzzing outside the screening of our tent all night non-stop.
We put our long sleeve shirts and pants on to keep from getting eaten alive as we packed up.
 We made it on trail even earlier this morning, around quarter of 6. Our plan was to make it to High Point State park as fast as we could so we could go swimming in the heat of the day. 
We made good time, but the bugs were still vicious and whatever we put on for bug spray didn't seem to repel them long. 
It was going to be hotter today and it heated up quickly, so by 9:30 it was oppressive and getting hard to breathe already. 
We made it to the park headquarters about noon where we met a couple of other thru-hikers, Pelican and Seagal. They too were struggling with the heat. We chatted for a bit then we headed for the beach. 
From the headquarters you have to cross the road to get to the trail again. We made it across the road and we were in the breakdown lane when a car passed a car that slowed down on the right and almost hit Mary. The cars around here seem to drive way too fast.
Of course, with the weather being so hot the beach was packed, but we didn't care. As soon as we arrived we dropped our packs and in the water we went.  Boy did it feel good. We swam for a bit and lounged around trying to avoid the heat. Finally, after one more swim we packed up and headed out for another six and a half miles to what they call the secret shelter.
We arrived to find nobody at the shelter yet.  The shelter is not an official shelter, but a small cabin and a couple of old out buildings set on a beautiful field.  It has a well with nice cold water, and an outdoor shower that is the perfect temp.
 We quickly got a nice grassy spot and set up our tent. Pretty soon the Godfather came in, a bit later Stoic came in as well as a couple of  hikers that we hadn't met yet. We took showers and then we cooked dinner. We calmed our thirst with cold, clean, well water. 
Lots of wildlife around tonight. So far we have seen a couple of groundhogs chasing each other, a skunk digging for grubs in the field, several deer, bunnies, and a whole litter of squirrels up on the roof of the shelter.

Well leaving the fly off last night ended up being a bad idea. The dew was so heavy last night that the tent and most of the stuff inside were very damp.  We thought we could have a leisurely morning in camp, as today we only have 13 and a half miles to go before we get to Vernon, New Jersey. We plan on going in for a resupply and a motel stay. The problem is once again it was blistering hot and the humidity hasn’t broken at all. 
Shortly after we left this morning we hiked down over some pastures then did a road walk all in the blazing sun. Next we entered the Wallkill Wildlife Preserve, which is basically a man-made swamp. The trail walks around three quarters of the swamp before reentering the woods. Most of that is in the beating sun. We put sunscreen on before we started, but by the time we got about half way around the sweat was running down our faces and the sunscreen was running right into our eyes.
 As soon as we finished with the preserve we started right up Pochuck  Mountain, another steep climb. By the time we got up over Pochuck Mountain we were already wishing we had gotten up earlier. The heat was really getting to us.
The straw that broke the camel's back was the Pochuck boardwalk, which is a three-quarter mile boardwalk, out in the open winding through a swamp. When we were halfway done with the boardwalk we didn't dare stop, the sweat was pouring off us so bad we thought if he stopped we might not get going again. We finally made it off the boardwalk, but still had a mile and a half to go through some shaded forest, but also some open field and swampy areas. 
When we finally made the road we both were about ready to pass out, it was all we could do to make it up the street to the little Garden Center and market where they sold some cold drinks and sandwiches. We quickly downed two Gatorades then ordered a couple sandwiches as well as a bag of chips to go with them. 
As soon as we finished  eating we quickly called the motel and the owner came down to pick us up.  We were never so glad to get to an air conditioned room where we could finally cool off and recover. We sat in the AC to cool off, but once we were cool we realized we still had to resupply.  
The owner sometimes gives rides into town, but he didn't offer a ride so I ended up walking down into Vernon, which is about a half mile away on a busy road. On the walk back I ended up ordering a pizza to have delivered because I didn't want to have to carry it back. We ate half of the pizza and put the other half in the refrigerator for carry out for lunch tomorrow. 
The heatwave is supposed to continue so we're going try to get going as early as we can tomorrow. Hopefully we can make some miles before we get overheated. There is a Creamery near where we hope to stop tomorrow where you can get ice cream and fill up on water, so that's our goal tomorrow.","Secret Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597188,"DAY 119The owner had agreed to take us back to the trailhead at 6:30 in the morning, so at 6:30 we were packed and ready to go. The first thing we hiked in the morning was what they call the Stairway to Heaven. This is a steep section of trail that they cut stone steps almost all the way up to the top of the ridge. It’s really quite amazing the amount of work they put into it. It was a tough way to start the day because even though it wasn't super-hot yet it was extremely humid. 
Not only has it been hot and humid, the bugs have been really bad, the mosquitoes are out in droves and gnats seem to be everywhere. We joke that the gnats seem to commit suicide by eyelash.  Meaning they fly around your face until they finally divebomb your eyes. Then you blink and they get trapped in your eyelashes or worse under your eyelid. This happens multiple times a day. You then spend the next five minutes trying to blink them out.
We trodded along  until we were ready for our first break, we thought Barrett Road would be an appropriate spot. We thought it would be fitting to find trail magic at Barrett Road, but when we got there, nothing. We stretched, had a snack,  and put on some more bug repellent and then started across the road. No sooner did we get to the other side of the road, when we spied a cooler, when we opened it it was full of ice cold drinks. This was the perfect trail magic as most of the water sources in the area have dried up, or are so low and gross that you don't dare drink out of them. We each grabbed a cold drink and with our spirits lifted we headed on. 
We hiked along the ridge that's the New Jersey/ New York border for quite some time. Finally, about lunch time we got to the official New Jersey /New York border. It's surprisingly tough terrain as you’re climbing up and down ledgey ridges. The small ups in downs not only slow you down, but really take a toll on you, especially in this heat and humidity.
 The last couple miles we really struggled as it was a steep rocky downhill, and we were pretty much out of water. When we got to the Creamery we each drank a full bottle of water before we even thought of ordering any ice cream. We then each ordered a large ice cream and sat in the air conditioning enjoying it. 
The Creamery is very hiker friendly.  They have a water spigot outback to fill your water bottles, an outlet to charge your electronics, and an area for hikers to sit. Before we headed out to hike the last couple miles to the shelter we filled our bellies, our water bottles, and I even hiked an extra 2 liters of water up to the shelter.
 It's a good thing we hiked the water out, because the spring at the shelter was dry. It's so hot and humid, and the mosquitoes wouldn't leave us alone for a minute, so we had to get in the tent as soon as we set up. 
It's going to be a long night because we are a hot, sticky mess and it's not cooling down at all. I hope  tomorrow we can make it to the beach where we can go swimming and hopefully get cooled down, but it will be a big day.","Vernon, NJ

Neither of us slept too well last night as it was so hot and humid. The mosquitoes were so bad we didn’t eat breakfast, we just put bug spray on and got moving.
 Both of us had trouble making any miles today, it seemed our strength was just zapped by the heat and humidity. Also, the trail just seemed to go up one rocky ridge only to go right back down. So every time we began to climb it really slowed us down. 
We knew our goal of making it to the park to swim in the middle of the day wasn't very realistic, and was going to be more like the end of the day. 
We had lunch up on one of the ridges and shortly after on the way down we met Pelican and Seagal slackpacking southbound. They also were struggling in the heat, and they didn't have fully loaded packs. They informed us that the terrain didn't get any better, but continued to go up and down rocky ridges. After we left we tried to stay positive about the miles we could make, but it became apparent after climbing one of the steeper ridges that we were about done for the day. 
We checked the guide and found  if we did one more climb and one more down we would come to a road crossing where we could get a motel room at one of the nearby towns. When we arrived at the road we decided to call it a day before one of us got hurt. We called a taxi and headed for the Tuxedo motel. Sadly, the cab ride cost half as much as the motel, and the ride was less than 4 miles. 
We  were disappointed that we made it only a little less than 10 miles, but with this heat and humidity we just can't hike big miles.
As soon as we arrived we put the AC on high, took showers, and then a little later ordered  pizza for dinner. As we were waiting for the pizza to arrive, Mary pulled a small tick off my ankle. I noticed it in the shower and wasn't sure if that is what it was. Sure enough, it was a deer tick. It was right at the sock line. Fortunately I don't believe it was on there longer than 48 hours, so I'll keep an eye on that area.
 It kind of rumbled thunder most of the afternoon, and it actually rained in the evening, so hopefully we will get a little bit of relief from the heat. Tomorrow we will give it another go.","Wildcat Shelter

Decided we should add that when we were at High Point State Park Beach,  we met an older gentleman in the water who was swimming laps along the swim line.  He's from New York, and asked if we were hiking the trail. We told him we were and he asked a bunch of questions regarding the trail. Then he mentioned that he had hiked Mount Rainier three times as well as Mount Kilimanjaro .  He thought we would be good candidates to hike Mount Kilimanjaro . He told us we would need to know one word in Swahili , Polepole (pronounced polly polly) , which means slow. He told us how he trained in New York by going into the taller buildings and hiking the stairs.  He would go in and get permission and they would look at him like he was crazy , especially when he came back with a backpack on. He said as he hiked on Kilimanjaro he would ask mother nature for permission to breathe.  Her answer was "" meh, go ahead."" Then he showed us how he would take a deep breath. He said he'd take a deep breath then take a step, take a deep breath take a step.
 We chatted with him for quite some time in the water and then told him we needed to go have lunch.  Before we left the water, he asked us what word in Swahili we needed to know. Mary remember it was Paul something, but I couldn't remember what it was at all.  He told me to hold out my hand which I did, and he told me Palm side down. He slapped my hand and said polepole so I would remember it in the future. 
On another note, you should be careful where you sit at High Point State Park Beach. Apparently Mary sat in sand fleas, you can imagine what kind of havoc they wreaked on someone who swells whenever she's bitten by any kind of insect.
Now onto today's Journal :
We got up, showered and had some leftover pizza and then headed down to the bottom of the hill to see if we could either find a ride back to the trail, or call a taxi. There didn't really seem to be anyone around to give us a ride, so we ended up calling the other taxi listed in guthooks. Thankfully this cab rate was much more reasonable. 
The New York portion of the trail is a lot tougher than you would think, and is more like New England hiking. The climbs are not quite the height of some of the  presidential peaks, but still lots of ups and downs nonetheless.
 We got dropped off where we left off at the beginning of Harriman State Park. Harriman State Park is no exception, you begin with a steep uphill climb all the way up to a ridge. From there you follow the ridge along going down short little climbs and right back up again on little ledgey areas. 
It was at least a little cooler today, but still very humid. It was so foggy it was almost raining out and you could see the moisture in the air. We hiked today to the lake where we planned to go yesterday before we crapped out. It was nearly lunchtime by the time we made it, so it was good that we didn't try yesterday as we never would have made it in time.
 We enjoyed a swim and then had lunch, eating the leftover pizza that we had packed out from last night.
 When planning a couple days ago, we hoped to make it to Montgomery tonight, but that's before we bailed out. So, we were unsure where we were going to make it tonight. We were still optimistic we may make it tonight but things would have to go right.
By lunch the sun had come out and it was heating up again. The trail was still rough so we were not making very good time, but we were charging on. 
As we came into William Bren Shelter we saw a doe with twin fawns off in the mountain laurel. Water is still real scarce, it's either jugs left by trail angels, or in this case William Bren has a spring that is not really flowing well, but there was water in it. We filled up our bottles there, after first drinking as much cold water as we could. 
At some point today we committed to making Fort Montgomery, but there were still three different ridges we had to climb up and over to get to town, and it was heating up again.
From West Mountain we called the motel, they had one room left so we booked it. We  still had 6 miles to go, so we told him that if they could pick us up it probably wouldn't be till 9 at night.  They said that was okay, so we went for it. 
We got out our remaining snacks and put them in our pack pockets. We still had to get down West Mountain and climb up Bear Mountain and get down Bear Mountain, this is after climbing at least four other peaks earlier today. 
 After finally getting down West Mountain we started up Bear Mountain. We climbed nonstop, the trail has many stone steps that have been  built into the back side of the mountain. When we finally made it to the top the sun was beginning to set. We took a quick run up the tower to get a couple pictures then started down the mountain. 
We realized we were going to be later than we thought, so we called the motel back and they said no problem, just call us when you get to the bottom.
The climb down begins on a short road walk, and soon there are a series of stone steps.
About halfway down it was too dark to safely walk, so we donned our headlamps and continued downward. 
At one point towards the bottom we saw a couple pair of eyes glowing in our lights. We soon realized it was a family of raccoons. As we got close they scurried off into the woods.
 When we finally got down we were exhausted not only from the long day, but also from having hiked the last 3 hours pretty much non-stop. We called the motel owner and he quickly arrived and put us into his air conditioned vehicle and brought us back to the motel.
 It was now well after 9:30, Allan, the owner, was gracious enough to give us some ice cold bottled water which we quickly drank. We showered and I ran across the street to the gas station and grabbed a couple way too expensive pre-made sandwiches. We ate, and off to bed we went.","NY 17 - Tuxedo Motel

We woke pretty stiff and sore, and that kind of confirmed that we were going to zero. The forecast was for rain today anyways. 
We went down to Perry's for breakfast, which is a little cafe located underneath the Ducati motorcycle dealer. Allan the motel, owner recommended  this as a good place to eat, and it was. We each had a breakfast sandwich and a cup of tea. 
After breakfast we had to get organized, and then talked to Allan about getting downtown to do our resupply and run some errands. He called the local salon and I got an appointment to get my haircut at 12:30. He agreed to drop us off downtown then.
 We got dropped off downtown and I got my haircut. Next we ran over to the hardware store to get some velcro to fix Mary shoes so her gaiters would stay in place. Then we went to the library for a little bit to work on the journal. 
While we were doing our resupply we saw Allan was in the store. He had brought a couple other hikers into town, turns out it's Waterboy and Wicked. We haven't seen them for quite some time, and thought they were way ahead of us. Allan waited while we did our shopping, and we all road back to the motel together. 
When we got back to the room we finished our chores and later we went across the street to the barbecue place for dinner. We had agreed to meet Wicked and Waterboy at the restaurant, and we all enjoyed a good meal. After dinner we just relaxed back at our room.
It is supposed to be a lot cooler tomorrow, so hiking should be much better. Allan's going to bring us back to the trail at 7:30, so we'll be up and ready then.","Bear Mountain Bridge Motel

We got up early and packed all of our stuff so we were ready to go. We headed down to Perry’s again for breakfast before we left. Today promises to be a better day as it was so cool we needed our fleece tops when we went outside.
 After breakfast Allan dropped us back at the bottom of Bear Mountain, we couldn't hike through the zoo as it was too early, so we took the bypass around and then started over the Bear Mountain bridge. Bear Mountain bridge is a big old suspension bridge that crosses the Hudson River. Mary wasn't too fond of the walk across. Of course, as soon as we crossed the bridge we started a steep climb up what's known as Anthony's nose. 
Our packs are not as heavy as normal because even though we have 4 days before another resupply, we're going to try to rely more on several of the delis located in convenience stores we will come across on this section of our journey. 
Once we got up over Anthony's Nose we were on a ridge and made pretty good time. When we came down we went into our first deli where we had our lunch. As we were ordering Wicked and Waterboy came in, they were doing the same thing. 
While we were eating lunch Wicked mentioned the site they may tent at. She said there are grassy campsites, a spigot  for water, and was about the right distance away. It's still feeling warm, but the humidity is not nearly as bad, so we feel a lot better when we're hiking. We ate half a deli sub for lunch and then packed the other half out for dinner tonight.
 At one point up on a ridge today we were relaxing and both actually fell asleep. We got to the campsite fairly early, and just as we were getting water in comes Jackrabbit. We haven't seen him for 700 miles or so. He is moving on tonight, but he said he has to get off trail in a couple of days to deal with some family issues. 
At the camp tonight are Waterboy and Wicked. Also Kib, and Mad Max who are both flip-floppers, and Roundabout who's doing a long 7 week section. A lot nicer in camp tonight, the mosquitoes are starting to come out as it gets dark, but it's not nearly as hot.","Bear Mountain Bridge Motel

Once again a great way to start the day, picking up the tent and eating breakfast in our fleece tops cuz it's so cool outside.
Today the plan involved getting to the state park where we can go swimming again. It seemed too cool in the morning to want to go swimming, but by the time we got to the park it had heated up enough, and we were glad we were there.
 We ran into Wicked and Waterboy  just as we were entering the park, they also came down for a swim. As has been the case lately, the park has a concession stand, so we went up to grab a quick lunch. It seems we’ve hardly eaten  out of our food bags in the last 4 or 5 days.
Even with the cooler weather early, it certainly warms up enough that we work up quite a sweat on the hills. Not sure why,  but neither Mary or I have had much energy, we both just seem tired like we want to take a nap. In fact after lunch and climbing up and over a ridge we got down to a road crossing and found a flat area to rest. We put our packs down and actually fell asleep leaning against them. Feeling a little better after the nap we pushed on towards RPH shelter. 
Near where the Graymoor Friary is we went through an area that has a ton of downed trees. A group of hikers we passed told us it was from a series of tornadoes that went through the area. They said there's another hard hit area near RPH shelter. 
The shelter is an old house that they made into a shelter. It is quite near the road, so it's famous because you can order pizza from here. It's still quite a hot day, so by the time we got to RPH shelter we found a couple lawn chairs and we sat down  in the shade. I think both of us fell asleep again.
 We debated about staying and ordering some pizza, but ultimately we wanted to make a few more miles so we pushed on further. Soon after we left the shelter we saw what the other hikers were talking about. We came to an area about a mile to two miles long that was just devastated with the trees down. Mostly massive Oaks that were either completely uprooted or sheared off near the top. I'm sure the trail maintainers must have had a huge job to get the trail back open.
 We were getting tired and it was getting late, but we decided at the road crossing that we were going to go down to the deli to get dinner. It's about six tenths of a mile down the road, but rumor is that they allow camping also. 
We arrived shortly before closing. We each ordered a sandwich with chocolate milk and ate outside at their picnic table. They offered to let us  camp, and they have a nice grassy lawn out back so we decided we would take them up on the offer. Also, we met Wayward who was setting up camp just before the road crossing. When he saw the grassy area here he decided to go back and get his stuff to camp here as well.There's another young hiker here too that passed us a couple times today, but he had his headphones on then and now he's currently on his phone, so we haven't had a chance to even learn his name. 
It was a pretty long day and we want to be up early before things get going around here to be packed up and gone, so we're heading off to bed.","Dennytown Road Campsite

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598467,"DAY 125We had the alarm set for 5, so we got up packed and were all ready when they opened at 5:30 . The owner seemed very friendly. Right around 5:30 he looked out back, waved his arm, and hollered “coffee is on.”  We went in and had a big cup of tea, breakfast sandwich, and a muffin, then we headed out for the day.
 It was fairly cool again today, but it warmed up quickly. So our first planned stop will hopefully be Nuclear Lake for a swim. 
After doing a short series of road walks to cross underneath 84 we came to a little bridge over a little stream. On the bridge was a sign that said bees, be careful please stay to the... and then it was scratched out. We'd also read warnings on guthooks about this bridge. We figured it was cool enough this morning, and also we would go over nice and slow not to rile anything up. We made it about three-quarters of the way across when I was just telling Mary to go a little faster, suddenly whack, I got one sting on the left shin. And then whack, I got another one on my upper right thigh. We put it in high gear and moved out of there. I never did see what it was that stung me, but I know they hurt. 
We made it to Morgan Stewart Shelter where we took a break. There we saw a bunch of southbounders packing up, and we warned them about the bees. 
When we made it to Nuclear Lake it wasn't quite as clear as I remember it.  I think it is warmer then when I was here In 2011, so the water was a little more murky. We both soaked our feet and I ended up jumping in because I was so hot and sweaty.
 As we were getting dried off we met at trail maintainer who was coming in to pick up some trash. She said they were doing a work party in the area, so there were a lot of people out working. 
Just as we were about to leave a young guy and girl from New Zealand arrived. He had hiked the trail in 2015 and was back for a visit. He said his trail name when he hiked was Bourne, I think because he looks like Jason Bourne. He was excited to talk about the trail again, so we chatted with him for quite a while before we moved on. 
It heated up quite a bit today, so by the time we got to New York 22, after crossing another swampy boardwalk, we were quite warm. There's a garden center at the crossing that offers a shaded gazebo, drinks, and either an outdoor cold shower or in indoor heated shower. 
We stopped to cool off with some ice tea in the gazebo, Mary took a hot shower, and I rinsed my head in the outdoor shower. Before we moved on there was also a food truck at the road crossing where we decided to grab a quick dinner.  Mary had a pineapple chicken sandwich and I had a cheesesteak. 
We finished our 20-plus mile day at the Wiley Shelter, we opted for there because it had a hand pump with good water. When we arrived there were no other thru-hikers, but there was a large group of co-ed kids on some outdoor club type outing. 
We set up our tent and filled up our water for tomorrow from the pump. As we were getting ready for bed I heard a couple of barred owls begin to call. Shortly after I heard squeaking which I wasn't sure what it was. Turned out it was coming from a barred owl right up above our tent on a branch. I probably shouldn't have but I couldn't help myself, I turned my Merlin app on the phone and made some barred owl sounds. This got him quite flustered and he flew off, but he  continued calling with the other owl for quite some time. 
We climbed into bed, but the group didn't quiet down for quite some time, even after being asked by their counselors to do so. The worst part was they were all running around with their headlamps on, quite often shining them into our tent as we were trying to sleep. Purple Haze wasn't too happy!","NY 52

We were up, packed up and gone before anyone even stirred at the camp next door. Another hot and sweaty night in the tent, and it's supposed to be warm today so we're hoping to make it to a little store early in the day to try to get a cold drink.
 We got a little turned around trying to get to the store. I thought we were going right over a covered bridge, but turns out we had to make a turn off the road we crossed and walk a little bit to the covered bridge to find the store. It was really too early for lunch, so we just grabbed a cold drink and a snack and sat at their picnic table. 
They're really nice in the store, they let us charge our phone with their outlet, and fill our water bottles from the faucet. Also, they had the air conditioning on very cold in the store.
We had to go into Kent to do a small resupply, but before we got there we had one ridge to climb up and across and go down into town. 
When we were at one of the lookouts on top of the ridge, we met a woman who was out doing some trail work. She offered to give us a ride into town when we got to the bottom, if we lingered and took our time because she said she was pretty slow. We thanked her and said we would probably take her up on the offer. With that she headed out at what seemed like a dead run, and was shortly out of sight. 
We started down too, but the trail is very rocky and steep in this area so we had to go kind of slow. At this point it was after 2:00 and we hadn't had lunch yet. We decided we better stop for a quick lunch because we were pretty much out of gas.
 Our quick lunch wasn't much at this point as we were out of peanut butter, so it was just a Fluff sandwich and a couple of snacks. By the time we got down to the road the “slow” woman was long gone, so we faced walking the .9 to town in the heat.
 When we arrived in town we went right to the visitor center where they offered phone charging, water fill station, restrooms and a coin operated hot shower. We opted for a shower first, but it was quite frustrating. The shower head sprayed at such a wide pattern that only two or three of the 16 water jets would strike your body. The water temperature, which you couldn't adjust, was so hot you could barely get underneath it.
 We had to take some of our water bottles in and fill it with water then dump it over us to actually get wet. And, the water was so hot when you dumped it over you nearly scalded yourself. We joked we could have had a cup of tea while we showered! So, we ended up paying $4 and we did get cleaned up, but not really cooled down.
After our “lovely” shower we headed over to the laundromat and put in our dirty clothes and walked next door to the IGA for a resupply. It was getting late, but we were hungry so we decide to go to the pizza place and eat. 
We each got a calzone and ate half and packed out half for tomorrow's lunch. After we ate it was really getting dark and we weren't looking forward to the hike back out to the trail, so we stopped at the outfitter on the way out of town and asked if there was any place to camp in town. His response was no, you have to hike back to the trail.
 It was really too expensive to stay in town, so we resigned ourselves to make the trip back out to the trail. It was getting dark now, and as we walked back to the trail the cars passing us had their headlights on.
 As soon as we got back on the trail we regretted getting going so late. The mosquitoes were terrible, and we now needed our headlamps to hike. The trail immediately goes up a steep ridge with very few places to camp. The benefits of our shower were soon lost as we began to sweat and stink all over again. 
About a half mile up we came to a semi flat spot where we could set our tent up, so we quickly set up in the viscous mosquitoes and quickly climbed in for the night. We lay there for quite a while in the heat before we eventually fell asleep.","Wiley Shelter

We packed up and got moving quickly this morning as it was too buggy to linger. We didn't even take the time to eat breakfast until we were up on the ridge about a half mile away. I didn't take the time to make my cereal this morning, so we each had some almond biscuits Mary had packed out for breakfast. They claim to give you four hours of energy, but in truth we were lucky to get 40 minutes out of them. We were starving shortly after. 
 Today's hike was mostly going up and down several ridges. Most notably was the ridge before going down St Johns ledges. St Johns ledge has a beautiful view, but then you have to scramble down a very steep section of boulders and steps, down to the Housatonic River. Once again Purple Haze was not impressed. 
Once we got to the bottom we had quite a long, flat walk along the Housatonic River. The walk should have been better, unfortunately our faces were swarmed with little gnats constantly getting into our eyes.
 We wanted to make the next shelter to eat lunch, so we hoofed it along. We were very hungry by the time we got there. We both downed our remaining calzones and had several snacks to boot. In the heat and with all the food on board we were feeling kind of lethargic again, so not too far down the trail we found a flat spot to sit down and actually ended up taking a quick nap again.
Not really much exciting today. With the heat, bugs and the ups and downs today what we were really looking for was something cold to drink, but we never got a chance to get anything. 
We had to stop within a mile of the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter, we needed a couple snacks to get us up the remaining hill. Once we arrived we did the normal stuff; set up our tent, cooked dinner, got water, and quickly headed off to bed.
 We were surprised again today that we didn’t see anyone we know on trail, and there are no hikers we know here at camp tonight, just a couple of flip flop hikers.
 We are excited that tomorrow there should be a good place for us to stop for lunch, so we're looking forward to it.","Stealth Campsite just outside of Kent

Still warm and buggy this morning, so we had breakfast with our long sleeve shirts on. Once we got going we climbed up on the ridge and shortly came to a view which they call hang glider view. Mary stretched there while we looked down upon the Limestone Connecticut race track. 
Once we came off the ridge we needed to cross the Housatonic again, and there was quite a road walk down across the bridge, out in through a cornfield, and by the local high school. Then the trail headed back into the woods and kind of continued parallel to the road for a while before we crossed it and then followed the Housatonic down to a parking lot. At the parking lot we were able to take a short side trip to the Toymaker cafe. 
The Toymaker cafe is a really neat place run by a couple. The wife, who is an author, and the husband, who is a former motorcycle racer and now restores British motorcycles. They started the cafe only opening for 4 days a week so they would have plenty of time to work on their real loves, writing and restoring motorcycles. Unfortunately, the cafe is so popular that it takes up most of their time. It's unfortunate for them, but fortunate for us as we had a delicious lunch there consisting of nice homemade sandwiches and home brewed iced tea. 
After we ate we talked to the owner for quite some time about his motorcycle racing exploits. He knew all about Laconia, New Hampshire and he had raced all around the world, but particularly here in the Northeast and up in Loudon, New Hampshire. It was really fun talking to him and as we talked we noticed what we really should have had was the waffles. They serve breakfast all day and they specialize in Belgian waffles. The ones we saw come out looked delicious, and we told him we would be back by sometime and try them. 
We met a couple from Canada that was traveling by motorcycle and had stopped in for lunch. They started asking us questions about the trail and wondered if she would be able to do it. Her daughter had started hiking the trail this year, and they've been down to support her. Now she's thinking she would like to do the trail and had quite a few questions for us, and we tried to be encouraging. We finally dragged ourselves away, very glad we had made the stop. 
Coming out of town we met a couple of hikers that were taking a shower at the outdoor shower, and then resting in the shade before they continued on the trail. We still had more miles to do, so we headed down to check out the falls and then we were soon back up to the ridge again, where we passed Giants thumb and quickly went out into a field that had a nice view of the mountains we were about to hike.
 We still had quite a climb to do, and by the time we got to the shelter we were coming in by headlamp. We had to scurry around to find a decent site, and quickly set up and got our camp chores done. We are camped on a wooden platform tonight, so we have a decent site. We passed the 1500-mile mark today, so we're happy about that. And, supposedly the shelter area has a beautiful view of the sunrise, which we hope to get up and enjoy in the morning.","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598681,"After a long day and a late night, by the time we looked out the tent the sun had already risen. So, we kind of rolled over and went back to bed. When we did get up we packed up and went over to the shelter to have our breakfast, it was a beautiful spot looking out down into the valley. We had breakfast with Loon Seeker, a hiker from Maine who is finishing up the trail. 
Today we are excited because we are going to be entering Massachusetts and leaving Connecticut behind.
We started right out with the climb up Bear Mountain which is the highest peak in Connecticut. On top is a huge cairn that you can climb up on top of and get a panoramic view. 
Soon after we headed down into Sages Ravine. At the start of the ravine is the actual Massachusetts/Connecticut border, even though the sign is located a mile or so away. Once we got down into the Ravine the water looked so inviting Mary soaked her feet and we both tried to clean a little of the grime off ourselves. 
When we reached the sign we stopped to take pictures even though it wasn’t the actual Massachusetts/Connecticut border. Then, we set off  starting the climb up Race Mountain. Once up on top you cross a series of ledges that run along the ridge with wonderful views all along. As a bonus there are lots of blueberries you can pick.
On the way down Race we met two hikers that I call official southbounders, meaning they started from Katahdin and were heading all the way to Georgia. I'm sure there have been others that have passed us and we just haven't seen them.
Mount Everett wasn't as bad as I remember going over, but we were pretty tired and hot by the time we got to the bottom. You come out at a little State Park and some kind souls had left some jugs of ice water there. We were grateful to have some cold water to drink and also to fill up our water bottles. We wanted to swim in Guilder pond, but when I looked at it it looked kind of swampy so we decided against it. 
As we were starting for the shelter we met a couple coming up from the pond, they said you have to go down for a swim. As we talked to them we realized the guy had thru hiked last year and had been told that he should go for a swim there, and when he did he was pleasantly surprised. He told us to follow the path down to a large rock and he said you won't regret it. 
We decided to take his advice and took the path down to the rock. At first we were little unsure, but we were so warm and sticky that we quickly just stripped down hopped in and it felt really good. I was certainly glad we met the guy and he convinced us to go in as the campsite was only a half mile ahead so we didn't even really work up a sweat. 
We arrived in camp still feeling pretty good from the swim and quickly set up on a tent platform. As we set up we realized it was starting to cool down a little. There's another Outward Bound type group camping here tonight, so it's pretty busy around the campsites. 
As we came in we saw Vermont setup right under a no camping sign. Later on we saw the two hikers that had been showering (outside back in CT) come in. Turns out these two hikers are Ed and Elaine, no trail names yet. They are  from England and are about our age and are thru hiking the trail. They seem really fun and we had a good time talking to them, but then they also had to go set up their camp. 
Tomorrow should be a short day because we're going into Sheffield to resupply and will be staying at Jess's, a hostel in town. Originally we planned on going into Great Barrington, but after calling around to the hotels we decided we couldn't afford it as most were well over $200 for just a night.","Riga Shelter
",Glen Brook Shelter ,"Jul 13, Fri",9.70
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598682,"It cooled down nicely last night, so we both slept pretty well. We  were up fairly early as we are excited because we're going into town. 
The map showed the trails would be pretty easy today. What that really meant was  it was pretty low elevation, but the trail went through some muddy, swampy areas with lots of bugs. 
As we neared town we came to the Shays Rebellion Memorial where we met a couple out walking their two dogs. As we walked through the field one dog was tuckered out and lagged behind. He kept falling in line behind us kind of hiking along with us even though they kept calling him. Eventually he did catch up and they finished their walk about a mile from where we were getting picked up to go to the hostel.
As we were crossing a small road we heard people say “trail magic”. A couple of local church groups got together and decided to do some trail magic.  They were grilling some hamburgers and had some cookies, bananas and watermelon. Ed and Elaine were there too as they were hiking just ahead of us. We chatted with them and with the people doing the trail magic for quite some time. Once again we enjoyed talking to Ed and Elaine. They hike at about the same pace as us. They have a deadline based on their visa and hope to be finished the last week of August or the first week of September. 
After enjoying trail magic we quickly made it to the US 7 road crossing and called Jess and she quickly picked us up. On the way into town we had mentioned we needed to resupply so she stopped at the Dollar General where we quickly got what we needed.
Jess’s hostel is her home where she rents out two bedrooms upstairs and another downstairs that is a porch converted into a bedroom. We ended up taking one of the upstairs bedrooms.  It was nice and pleasant, we got a chance to dry all of our stuff, get our laundry done and relax for the afternoon.
In the evening we went down to the local cafe that Jess recommended. Each of us had a nice grilled sandwich and a local beer from a new brewery here in Sheffield. For dessert we had pecan pie that had chocolate in it.  It was delicious!
Also staying at the hostel is Songbird, a section hiker that is finishing his last little section. He has been at the hostel for 4 days as he has been sick with bronchitis. There is also one other hiker named Monk who came in while we are eating, and by the time we got back he was already in his bedroom. Apparently he's going to try to do 29 miles tomorrow, so he's getting an early night's rest. 
It rained a little late this evening and it is supposed to rain tonight, so we're glad to be indoors once again.","Glen Brook Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598683,"Jess had told us breakfast would be ready at 7, so we were up and packed by 6:30. We had a really nice breakfast of yogurt, granola, fruit, eggs and toast. 
Jess had already dropped Monk off as he is slack packing 29 miles today. We loaded in the car with Songbird, he was going back about a mile further than we were as he got off at the Jug End Road. 
It did rain last night, so everything was wet and it was very foggy this morning. It was extremely humid and the mosquitoes were out in full force this morning. We quickly stopped and put on as much bug spray as we could.
We went through a wet and swampy area, so we had to just keep moving as the bugs still  found their way through. We fought the bugs most of the morning, finally stopping at the Tom Leonard shelter for lunch. At the shelter we met a group of young kids packing up after an overnight and chatted  with them for a while. 
Just as we were finishing lunch a hiker, Curb, came in. This is the first time we've met him. In trail registers we’ve read where several people have gone swimming in  Benedict Pond which was coming up and we thought we might try to go for a swim there.
It was a tough climb up to the pond, so we were ready for a swim. We were just going to swim at the rocks near the trail, but when we got there to that spot there was a couple there with a couple dogs and we didn't feel very comfortable swimming there. 
Shortly thereafter we met a southbounder, she was looking to swim also. So we decided we walk down to the beach 6 tenths away to go swimming with her. 
The swim was great, but by the time we got done and then hiked the four miles to North Wilcox Shelter you wouldn't have known we got cooled off. It was very buggy, so we quickly set up then put our long pants and long-sleeve shirts on to cook and eat.
We also met Scoot for the first time, he's hammocking here at the shelter.  Fresh Sneakers and Clydesdale came in. Later Ashley came in to tent beside us, we'd met her down at the State Park while swimming.
 It's supposed to be another hot day tomorrow, so we're going to try to make it to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. We plan to tent there as we can definitely go swimming and be cooled off right before bed.","JessTreat's - Sheffield

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598684,"Up pretty early this morning as we wanted to get going and get to Upper Goose Pond as early as we could so we would have plenty of time to swim. 
There was another shelter just prior to where we stayed, (1.8 miles) so today it seem like there are a lot of hikers on the trail that we played leapfrog with all day. Most of the day we played leapfrog with Ashley, Songbird, Baygull and Tiny Bytes. Fresh Sneakers and Clydesdale were planning to do the 34 into Dalton, but we did manage to see Fresh Sneakers at the AT Snack Shed.
 Today a southbounder had mentioned to us that there was a snack shed at one of the road crossings and we definitely should go. Sure enough, at one of the crossings there was a sign that said AT Snack Shed. Several hikers were already there when we arrived. 
The shed is run by Running Springs farm, they sell eggs from the shed, but they also have a refrigerator inside with cold sodas and  lots of snacks hikers like. We had a soda, a bag of chips and a package of Oreos. Everything is done on the honor system, you just pay for what you take. 
As we sat at the picnic table enjoying our snacks  several more hikers came to the road crossing, saw the sign, and came over to sit at the picnic table to enjoy some snacks. It was nice sitting in the shade at the picnic table talking to everyone, but we decided we better get going if we we're going to make Upper Goose Pond.
A lot of little ups and downs and it got harder as the day went on, plus the mosquitoes were still heavy. Even though it was only a 14 mile day it seemed longer and when we got there we were pretty spent. 
The swim felt extra nice, the water was just right. It was pretty warm on top, but there were lots of cold spots.  It felt really good on a hot day. As we were lounging in the pond we couldn't believe it when we saw Sourpatch and Knotty Boy come in. We  figured they were at least three or four days ahead of us. Turns out they went to New York City and spent time there, so once again were caught up to them.
The swim was just what we were looking for and needed today. After the swim we were able to relax a little bit and talk with the other hikers. We  had plenty of time to make dinner and just sit around and enjoy ourselves. 
We tried going down to the dock to watch the sunset, but as dusk came so came the mosquitoes with a vengeance! So we headed to our tent. Tomorrow there will be pancakes for breakfast, and we've made a reservation in Dalton for a motel, but it's 20 miles away so we have a big day planned.","Mr Wilcox North Shelter
",Upper Goose Pond,"Jul 16, Mon",14
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598685,"We were up early to get ready for Pancakes, the mosquitoes were out in full force as we packed everything up. 
We waited on the porch with the others as the caretaker was making the pancakes. Most of the other hikers were interested in coffee, but Mary poked her head in to see if the caretaker could put on some tea water for us, she gladly did. 
She can only cook 2 pancakes at a time, and bring them out on platters of 6. With 15 or 20 hungry hikers all waiting for pancakes the platters didn't last very long. We did our best at making sure everyone got a chance to have pancakes though, some were better than others. In the end I think most got their fill of pancakes and had coffee or tea and were happy and ready to hike on. 
The call was for rain today, so some hikers we're going to zero at the cabin and others were maybe going to go on just to the first shelter and wait out the rain. And still others like us were going to try to make it to Dalton. We really didn't have a choice as we already had a reservation in Dalton, so we started out fairly quickly trying to get a few miles in before the rain started. 
It wasn't long after we crossed the Mass Pike that we came to the trash can we had heard about. A couple of hikers were already there (Espresso & Clover), and when we stopped and looked in we saw the can was full of big bags of potato chips as well as lots of hostess Twinkies and cupcakes and stuff like that. All the drinks had been taken, but we got a quick sugar fix. 
Several  hikers came in right behind us,  everyone stopping to get another quick fix of sugar to go on top of the pancakes they had just enjoyed. Soon everyone was heading down the trail buzzing along. 
About a mile before the first shelter, where we planned to eat lunch, the rain started coming down. First it was light rain, but then we got a couple of hard showers. It's been so dry that the leaves seemed to suck up all the rain before it really hit the ground. 
By the time we got to the shelter we were a little wet, but the rain had mostly stopped. We were able to eat under the overhang and stay nice and dry with the other hikers. Soon the rain was starting to pick up again as we were getting ready to leave, all the other hikers decided they were going to either wait out the storm or spend the night there. We really didn't have that option, so we put on our rain gear and started out.
Shortly after we headed out the rain pretty much stopped and the sun started to come out, so off came the rain gear.  Naturally, not long after we got going again the rain started, and this time it picked up and was a little more steady. We didn't want to stop again, so we just hiked on hoping it would let up again. 
Soon it was really coming down and we could hear the thunder and see the lightning in the distance. By this time we were already wet so it didn't matter, we just kept going. It was also about this time that I realized I left my Gatorade bottle that I mixed my lemonade in back on the picnic table, so I only had one bottle of water. We decided to make the side trip to the cookie lady where you can get water and she also hands out cookies to hikers.
When we arrived at the cookie ladies house I went up on the porch to make sure it was okay to get water. I knocked and it took awhile before an elderly gentleman came to the door. He said I could get water and handed me a couple cookies. 
As I was leaving the porch I stepped on the first step which was sopping wet and all mildew, so it was like greased lightning. Sure enough, I slipped and landed flat on my back. I was very fortunate to have my pack on because I landed on the pack and really didn't get hurt at all. It hurt my pride more than anything. After that incident we marched on to town in the pouring rain, the thunder and lightning quickening our pace.
The terrain was mostly flat, but there were enough bumps that it still made for a long hike. As we neared town the rain stopped and the mosquitoes came out in full force. Sure enough, as we approached town the trail had one more hill for us making for a big climb up followed by a long climb down.
Once we got down we paralleled the railroad tracks for some time before we finally hit town for the long road walk down to our motel. We were pretty tired and soaking wet, so we headed right for Cumberland Farms where we each grabbed a chocolate milk and a bag of chips. 
The motel was just down the street, so we quickly made our way there. The office was closed, but she left the key to our room in an envelope in the mail slot. We got into our room, got hot showers, and started to dry out our stuff. We then headed next door to the sub shop to get a bite to eat before we went to bed. Happy to be warm and dry after a long day of hiking in the rain.","Upper Goose Pond

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599134,"After such a big day yesterday we slept in today. We knew we weren't going to get out early because we still had quite a few chores to do before leaving.
Just up the street from the motel is the Java House, where we grabbed a bagel sandwich and a cup of tea. There were several hikers in there, and when we got back we realized there were also several hikers at the motel that we hadn't seen because we got in so late. 
We quickly gathered up our laundry and started that as soon as the laundry room opened. While we were waiting we saw Ed and Elaine, they also stayed last night and were getting ready to head out. 
Shortly after we saw Baygull and Tiny Bytes who commented that they were going to zero, so before we left we gave them a couple beers we had since we decided we wouldn't pack them out.
We didn't resupply too heavily because we knew would be going through Cheshire today and right by a Dollar General, so we will pick up some more supplies then.
As we headed out of town we climbed right up over Crystal Mountain before coming down into Cheshire. By the time we made the climb and arrived into town we were pretty hot, so we decided to treat ourselves to an ice cream. 
As we were relaxing and eating our ice cream in the shade, Knotty Boy and Sourpatch arrived. They decided they deserved an ice cream as well and sat down and joined us. When we finished we headed down to Dollar General to do a quick resupply. Again we didn't need too much as tomorrow we will be going through Williamstown which has a larger store. 
The day finished with a long uphill climb on to the shoulder of Mount Greylock and ended at the Mark Noepel Shelter. When we arrived the shelter was nearly full and it was getting dark. No tents sites were available, so the only thing we could do was tent in one of the areas nearby that they are trying to restore. We didn't like doing that, but they require you to stay at a designated campsite and the next one was too far for us to travel. We got water, put our food in the bear box, and headed off to bed.
 Tomorrow is going to be a big day, hopefully we'll get out of Massachusetts and enter into Vermont.","Dalton, MA

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599137,"We were up very early this morning. First, because we didn't want to be in an illegal campsite if a Ridge Runner came along, and we wanted to get a jump on getting up Mount Greylock. 
We were the first ones out of camp and to the summit of Mount Greylock. When we arrived on top Bascom Lodge was open so we decide to go in for a cup of tea and a muffin. 
When we finished eating we decided to go up and have a look around the tower. When we arrived we realized we were about 20 minutes too early so we decided we would wait. 
The tower was supposed to open at 9:30, and around 9:30 a crowd began to gather, but no one showed up to unlock the door. After 15 minutes or so a lot of the people decided to leave and then someone decided to go check at the lodge to see if they had a key. They came back and said the lodge had nothing to do with the tower, it was the park service. After another 20 minutes went by someone finally said she had called the park service and they said someone was on their way, claiming they were short staffed. Ten minutes later a young gentleman showed up, slowly walked up to unlock the door saying nothing and then headed on his way. I found it strange that at a War Memorial where you are asked  to be quiet and respectful a guy can show up an hour late, unlock the door and say nothing whatsoever. 
Once the tower was open we made the climb up, and our patience was  rewarded with an amazing view on a beautiful, crystal clear day. Even though we had a real early start all the delays put us kind of behind, so we started to make our way down to Williamstown as quickly as we could. 
The descent is pretty steep in places and our knees took a pounding. One of the town councilmen lives near the road crossing, and he provides bicycles for hiker to use to pedal into town to get supplies. We had hoped to use these, but when we arrived all the bikes were gone. We ended up walking the 9 tenths into town to the store.
Once again we didn't plan real well, we probably just should have gotten everything at the Dollar General as this added a hot road walk of nearly two miles to our hike for the day. 
After we got our resupply done at the store, we ate dinner at a picnic table outside. We then loaded more food into our already heavy packs. This meant for a long, hot road walk back to the trail, and I complained the whole time about how heavy my pack was. 
We got back to the trail and immediately headed up a steep hill. It was getting late,  but we really wanted to make the Vermont border tonight so we kept pushing on later than we would have liked. We made the border around 7:00, took some pictures and then hurried down trail to the next shelter.
 By the time we arrived we could barely see. We quickly found a site by headlamp and set up and got ready for bed. It's loud at the campsite tonight, we can hear four-wheelers, chainsaws, and even what seems like a baby crying nearby.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599511,"We didn't sleep too well last night as what we thought was a flat campsite turned out to bet quite a hole. So consequently we ended up rolling into each other all night. Also, it was a very hot and sticky night.
Since we were so tired we didn't get out of camp until fairly late, and it seemed we were tired most of the day today. We found out there was a baby in camp last night because not too soon after we left we were passed by ""Dr. Ice"" and ""Evergreen"", their baby, and their dog Fuzzy. Dr. Ice had the baby in a front carrier and Evergreen was carrying a homemade crib. They are hiking the Long Trail, and seem like a wonderful family.
We stopped at Roaring Branch Pond for a cup of tea and a stretch break. Normally stopping at an area like this would not be possible due to the mosquitos. We were pleasantly surprised that we were able to stretch, sit down and enjoy a cup of tea and enjoy the beauty of the pond without being bothered by any bugs.
So far Vermont has been nicer as far as bugs go, and the spruce forest feels more like home. As hot as it has been the last couple days we couldn't resist soaking our feet and getting a layer of filth off in a stream. 
Stopped at Congdon Shelter for lunch, and then proceeded up Harmon Hill. We stopped for the view, and enjoyed some raspberries that were growing nearby. While we were enjoying the view we put in a call to the Green Mountain Hostel so we would have a bunk available once we reached Manchester Center.
Many hikers were going into Bennington for pizza, however, we had all we needed for supplies and continued the steep climb to Melville Nauheim Shelter. There were three other hikers already set up. One is section hiking the Long Trail, one is close to finishing a thru hike of the Long Trail SOBO, and the other is NOBO on the Long Trail and actually started his hike in New York.
Not many great looking tent sites, but we found one that fit our tent ok. After enjoying socializing with the other hikers, we headed to our tent for what we hope will be a better nights sleep than last night.","Seth Warner Shelter

After only a short time on the trail Mary's feet were sore so we stopped at Hell Hollow Brook so she could soak her feet. Dr. Ice and Evergreen had camped here last night and were still getting ready for the day. 
After eating lunch along the trail, we made a quick stop at the Goddard Shelter and got water and then made our way to the Glastenbury Mountain Lookout Tower. We climbed up the tower and enjoyed an amazing view. Knots was already up on the tower and was sharing the view with her mom using her phone.
We arrived at the shelter and Sourpatch and Knotty Boy were set up in the shelter along with a Long Trail hiker who is almost done his SOBO hike. It is supposed to rain tonight. There were several other tents set up, but lots of good tent sites at this shelter. We found a good soft spot in the back away from the shelter. It turns out to Dr. Ice, Evergreen, baby, and dog are camped right below us tonight.

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599513,"It was raining when we woke, so we decided to roll over for a few more moments. Once it seemed like it was just dripping off the trees we got up and headed down to the shelter for breakfast.
As we were ""enjoying"" breakfast in the shelter with Sourpatch and Knotty Boy, in came Ed & Elaine. They had gone into Bennington and had been at Kid Gore Shelter last night, and joined us in the shelter to make their breakfast. Our reservations for the hostel are for tomorrow night, and we are going to be close on food. We have earmarked all of our food so we know what we can have for snacks and meals so we hopefully won't run out. 
We made our way up Stratton Mountain knowing we wouldn't have a view. There is a caretaker cabin on Stratton, and also a side trail to the Gondola that you can take down to restaurants if it is running. Once at the top, we stood outside the caretaker cabin wondering if we should knock. We weren't even sure it was the caretaker cabin as it was so small. In the guides it says to stop in and say hi to the caretakers, and we had actually been hoping it would be a bigger cabin that we could get in to get out of the rain and enjoy lunch. Soon the door opened slightly and Jean peeked out and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. We said we were fine, and that we were going to try to find a try spot to have our lunch. We were wondering about the gondola, which Jean said she didn't think was running today due to the weather. After a few moments she asked if we'd like to come in and have our lunch in the cabin. We gladly accepted her offer.
The cabin is quite small, but she offered us a place to sit and also offered us some hot tea. It was wonderful to be out of the weather for lunch and to actually have some hot tea to go with our peanut butter and fluff sandwiches as we had gotten quite chilled. We chatted with Jean and her husband Hugh for close to an hour. They have been caretakers here off and on for 50 years, with Hugh actually starting out as a ""fire spotter"" in the fire tower. They spend six months out of the year at the cabin with two days off a week and live nearby. Now that the fire tower is closed, they are educators and historians and keep track of visitors and the number of hikers passing by. We wished we could stay longer, but figured we better get going so we can make it to Manchester Center for our reservations tomorrow. We told them we would come back for a visit and bring them something and asked what they would like. Hugh's immediate response was chocolate.
As we continued down the trail from the summit along came Sourpatch and Knotty Boy. We thought they were ahead of us as they left the Shelter before us. They said they had gone up the fire tower and when they came down had mistakenly gotten on the blue blazed trail which led to the gondola. When they saw the gondola they decided they may as well head down to the restaurants for lunch. They said lunch was good, but expensive. $20 got a sandwich, donut and a cup of coffee. We would have liked to enjoy a gondola ride and lunch at a restaurant, but in the long run we figure our visit with Hugh and Jean will be more memorable.
We made it down to the side trail to the shelter, but since the shelter was .5 off trail we decided to find a site nearby. Just across the stream from the shelter we found a nice spot to set up. This will leave us just under six miles tomorrow to get to the road where we can hitch to Manchester Center. Dr. Ice, Evergreen and family arrived and were searching near the trail for a site so I walked down to let them know there were some better sites near where we were set up. We had cleaned up in the stream earlier, and had a quick dinner and got in our tent for the evening.","Story Spring Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599516,"It rained heavily last night and was raining when we woke up this morning. We kind of lingered until we heard a break in the rain and then we quickly got up and had breakfast and packed up.
As we were leaving it started to sprinkle so we put our rain gear and pack covers on. Of course as always, shortly down the trail it stopped and we got too hot and took them off. And then of course, like always, it took this as a sign to begin sprinkling and then rain, and then pour. It was a slow build up so we didn't take the time to stop to put our rain gear back on, so by the time we realized we should it was too late and we were already sopping wet.
We headed for the next shelter which was about 3 miles from town to try to take a quick break. When we got there we saw Knotty Boy and Sourpatch standing on the porch contemplating whether they should leave or not. They decided they were going to get wet so they put their packs on and headed out. We decided to wait it out a little bit longer as it was still raining really heavy.
Soon after they left another hiker came in. His name was Red Socks. He wears red socks and is hiking Vermont and then the Mohawk Trail to Boston. We chatted with him for a while then we decided we better get going too. 
It varied between just raining and really pouring the last 3 miles into town, so the trail was quickly becoming a stream. There were several streams to cross on the way into town, and with the rain they became quite swollen. A couple of them were very intimidating as we crossed them. You could hear them raging some distance away, and when you got up to them the rocks that are usually exposed to help you get across were now under water. 
Honey Badger and Smiles, who had passed us earlier on the trail were just getting into a car as we arrived at Vermont 11 & 30. Getting into the same vehicle were Ed & Elaine, who said they had waited 30 minutes already for a hitch. We quickly put our thumbs out, and after several minutes a nice woman named Martha stopped to give us a ride. She said she had told herself that she would stop at least once and pick up hikers who needed a ride and we were her first hikers. We were thankful to get a fairly quick hitch as we were soaking wet and looking forward to getting to town and eventually the hostel.
Once we arrived in Manchester Center, Martha dropped us at the Price Chopper. Sourpatch, Knotty Boy, Ed, Elaine, Honey Badger, and Smiles and a few other hikers were all under the awning of the Price Chopper. We chatted for a while, and told Sourpatch and Knotty Boy it would probably be the last time we saw them as they were heading back out on the trail. Since we were hungry we headed to the Pizza shop for a late lunch. Mary took the time to take off her wet socks and shoes in the entry and put on her crocs. We ordered beer and pizza and found a table. It took forever for the beer and pizza to finally make its way to our table, but once it arrived it was really good.
With a full belly we made our way to the outfitter to see if they had any Brooks shoes for Mary, which they didn't. We did pick up a fuel canister and a new bag for our water filter as our bag had recently sprung a leak. Elaine was trying on hiking shoes as she really needed a new pair. They didn't have the ones she wanted, but she eventually found a pair she thought would work. 
Went back to the Price Chopper to get our resupply and then we called the hostel for a ride. Duffy arrived shortly, and we were headed for the hostel. Once at the hostel Duffy showed us our room and we quickly got our showers and then started our laundry. They have clothes you can borrow so you can wash all your clothes, which is really nice. 
We attempted to dry our tent, fly and other items on the line, but it continued to rain off and on. The hostel has $1 pints of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, so of course we each got a pint of Phish Food which we thoroughly enjoyed. Later we cooked a pizza we had picked up at Price Chopper and enjoyed a free soda provided by the hostel.
Also at the hostel tonight are Songbird, Plodalong, Grandma Shortie, Crazy Brit, D2, Old Scout and a couple other hikers as well. I talked with Plodalong for quite awhile as he is also a retired firefighter from MA. We enjoyed chatting with Grandma Shortie and Crazy Brit and D2 as well. We checked with Jeff and Duffy about a possible slackpack south tomorrow back to the hostel, and we were able to secure another night, but we will be in the overflow area tomorrow night (""the Dawg House""). 
Off to bed as our shuttle leaves at 6:00 am.","Tent Site near William Douglas Shelter

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599752,"We did this section as a SOBO slackpack.
Up early as our shuttle left at 6:00 so they can be back to do the normal shuttle back to the trailhead.  Had a quick breakfast provided by the hostel of cereal & bananas as well as a cup of tea. Plodalong & Grandma Shortie joined us on the shuttle, they did the section we will do today yesterday. Today they are heading north. Got to chat some more with Plodalong as we rode to the trail, we swapped some firefighter ""war stories"".
The first shelter we passed had several hikers, most still sound asleep. When we arrived at the second shelter we decided to make a quick stop there for a privy break. Once again who did we see, Sourpatch and Knotty Boy. They just shook their heads when they saw us. After a short chat with them, ending with a ""we are sure this will be the last time we see you"", Knotty Boy replied ""See you later..."" and off we went.
The trail had really nice footing early on in the day. There were quite a few bog bridges around the Griffith Lake area. We enjoyed a view on Baker Peak and walked along some ledgey trail. Because we were going Southbound we met several Northbound hikers that we have previously hiked with. We came across Smiles & Honeybadger and they gave us some updates on other hikers we know. We also saw Elaine & Ed, and when we stopped for lunch at Styles Peak TNT & Biscuit were there drying out their gear and having lunch. It was a great spot for lunch with a view of Magic Mountain Ski Area.
We dropped down into a notch before making our final climb up to Bromley Mountain. Still good views up here, though when I passed through here last time in 2011 there was an observation tower which provided 360 degree views. The tower was apparently condemned and torn down, but signage indicates they are doing a fund raising campaign to build a new tower. Made a quick stop at the warming hut, checked out the log book, and then started our descent. 
Made it back down to the road crossing to hitch into town again. Took quite a while to get a hitch today even though it wasn't raining this time. Finally a woman who passed by turned around and came back to offer us a ride. She said we really looked like we could use a ride. We chatted as she drove us to Manchester Center, and she told us her brother owns a ski & sport shop in Vermont and she was going to pick up some signs for a ski sale they are having. She needed to stop and grab the signs, and offered to take us to the pizza place she was going to. We decided we should eat closer to town so we would be ready for our shuttle. Went to Cilantro's for dinner where we met another thru-hiker who was also going back to the hostel. 
After dinner I started to call the hostel to let them know we were ready for a pickup when my phone rang and Jeff asked if we were ready as the other hiker had called from the outfitters. 
We got back early enough that there was still sunshine to hang our tent, fly and other gear out so it will be dry and ready for tomorrow. We also washed our hiking pole handles. And, the biggest accomplishment was finding the hole in my Neo-Air. It has only been over a month of inflating my mattress two or three times a night. We had stopped at Rite-Aid and bought a small spray bottle which I filled with water and some Dawn dish soap. I simply sprayed the whole pad and soon found a small hole which I was able to easily patch once the pad was dry.
Mary & I split a Pint of Ben & Jerry's, enjoyed chatting with other hikers including Crazy Brit and D2 and then headed to the ""Dawg House"", which is a partially converted horse barn for bed. Every once in a while we could hear a horse banging the wall, hopefully they won't keep us up tonight as we need to be up early once again for our shuttle.","Manchester Center Vermont (Green Mountain Hostel)
",Danby Langrove Road,"Jul 24, Tue",17.60
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599763,"We slept amazingly well last night, the horses didn't keep us up. We went in to the hostel and made some egg and cheese muffins and hot tea. Got ready for the shuttle. Another hiker wanted to back to the trail early today, so we made a quick detour before getting to our starting point at Danby Langrove Road.
Grandma Shortie and Plodalong had mentioned the possibility of catching a bus into Rutland and getting a room and then slackpacking back to the room the following day. We decided that since the weather looks like it might be bad tomorrow we may try to do something similar.
The weather was dreary, misting on and off all morning. We put our rain gear on, but had to take it off as we got too hot and sticky going up one of the climbs.
When we arrived at White Rocks Cliffs we were sad to see that someone had destroyed all the ""rock stacking art"". People have started to rebuild, but it is nowhere near as vast and impressive as when I passed through in 2011. Apparently some people feel it is ""rock graffiti"", and someone actually wrote on the sign ""stop rock graffiti"". Isn't it ironic that they were placing graffiti on an official trail sign.
We played leap frog with Franklinstein and his hiking partner (forgot her trail name). After being relatively mosquito free since we entered Vermont, today they started to come out in full force, probably due to the recent rain. I took my second fall shortly after White Rocks Cliff, nothing major, just a fall into the scrub spruce. No cuts, bruises or damage done. By the way, Mary took her first fall of the trip yesterday as she was crossing a small stream area. It was actually quite a graceful, controlled fall and she didn't get hurt. 
We climbed Bear Mountain and walked along the ridge. As we started down we had a nice view into the Rutland Airport. Very steep, wet, and slippery going down into Clarendon Gorge and we saw where many hikers had slid several feet in the mud. Crossed the shaky suspension bridge over the gorge, stopping to take a few pictures. 
At some point in the day we decided to take Grandma Shortie & Plodalong's advice, but rather than get a hotel in Rutland we decided we would stay at the Inn at Long Trail as we have often thought of staying there in the past. Once we arrived at the parking lot at VT 103 we called the bus service and were told they could pick us up at the parking lot, however, we would miss the last bus leaving Rutland to the Inn. So, we proceeded to cross the road and put our thumbs out for a hitch. We were quickly picked up by a gentleman who recently retired and was heading to the gym in Rutland, and he was kind enough to drive us right to the bus station. Because we got there so quickly we were able to make the last bus to the Inn at Long Trail which left about 5 minutes after we arrived.
Made it to the Inn and we were happy to find that they had rooms available. We would have called ahead, but hikers get a reduced rate if they book in person. We booked two nights so that tomorrow we can slackpack back. Headed to our room for showers and then down to McGrath's Irish Pub for dinner and beer.
Off to bed, tomorrow we will catch a bus back to the trailhead.","Danby Langrove Road

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599776,"Went down for tea followed by a nice breakfast which is included with your stay. Enjoyed the omelet of the day and some orange juice and hot tea. The first bus didn't leave the Inn until 8:21, so we got to enjoy a leisurely breakfast.
Once on the bus I asked the driver about making the connection with the Ludlow bus to get back to VT 103. He informed me that there were no more buses until after 4 pm. This put a damper on our ""well crafted plan"". Already on the bus were Grandma Shortie and Plodalong. They advised us that another hiker had told them that there was a dangerous water crossing on the way up Killington, and they were going to save that climb for a day when they would have a nice view.
We arrived in Rutland and made our way to the Yellow Deli Hostel to see about possibly getting a shuttle. One of the hikers at the hostel suggested we call a shuttle driver he had used that was listed on the bulletin board. We called and he said he was available and asked us to see if anyone else needed a ride as he wouldn't be available later on in the day. We saw Carly, who stayed at the hostel. We hadn't seen her since Delaware Water Gap. As we were waiting for the shuttle we saw Honeybadger and Smiles who also stayed at the hostel and were going to zero today.
Our plan was to hike 19 plus miles, but since we didn't get an early start we were starting to wonder if this would be possible. The trail started right out with a steep climb up to a view. After hiking a section that was fairly flat and crossed several gravel roads and some streams we decided to stop for lunch. Had our peanut butter and fluff sandwiches sitting on a log beside the trail. Franklinstein and his hiking partner passed by, we had seen them earlier on by a stream. 
We soon started the long climb up Killington on a trail surrounded by spruce. It was a wet climb, but we didn't have any problems at any of the water crossings. We decided not to take the steep .2 mile side trail to the summit as there was no chance of a view and it was starting to rain. We did stop at the Cooper Lodge Shelter to stretch and call my parents to secure a ride home for a family reunion in Maine.
Water poured down the trail as we traversed the trail near the summit. We slowly made our way along the trail wondering if we would be able to make the full 19 + miles. When we came to the road crossing at Rt 4 we decided we better call it a day as it was getting late and we still had over 2 miles to go plus a half mile walk out to the Inn. We decided to hitch the half mile up the hill to the Inn and had no sooner stuck our thumbs out when we were immediately picked up by two young girls, Journey and Taylor. Unfortunately, in our tired state, we had hitched in the wrong direction. Taylor soon mentioned to Journey that she thought the Inn was the other way, and I realized of course she was right since the Inn was at the top of the hill.
Once back at the Inn we quickly got our laundry started (the last load had to be in by 7:30 and we just made it) and took showers and headed down to the pub for dinner. It was a long day, but tomorrow we will be heading home and then to Maine to enjoy some time with several members of Mary's family.","VT 103

We drove to Hanover where we dropped our car, then we took a bus back to Killington where we needed to get back on the trail. The bus driver was kind enough to drop us right at the trailhead, but we didn't actually arrive until nearly 4:15.
After 3 days off and sitting for so many hours our legs didn't really want to go, so we struggled to make it up the first hills. The trail here goes through a really pretty area, including Kent pond and Thunder Falls. 
We wanted to get as many miles in as we could as we only planned on taking 3 days to Hanover, but with such a late start it is looking more like three and a half days.
Once we got past Thunder Falls boardwalk we figured if we could make most of the next climb we would be happy. It was getting nearly dark and we were tired when we were about three quarters of the way up. We found a flat spot and decided to take it. We quickly set up, hung our bear bag and climbed into bed. Turns out we did nearly 7 miles, so not that bad for getting such a late start. Hopefully tomorrow we will have more energy.","Vermont Rt 4

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600403,"DAY 147We woke early enough, but had trouble getting out of bed. The site we had chosen had nice soft leaves and finally with my Neo-Air patched I didn't have to blow it up at all last night, so both of us slept really well. Once we finally got moving we got up and had oatmeal. This is a dry site, so we didn't have enough water to make tea. 
We decided to hike the three miles to Stony Brook Shelter where there is water and have tea there. Maybe it's the days off or maybe the cumulative effect of the hike, but we seemed to move very slowly today and both of us quite tired.
When we got to the short trail to the Lookout we decided to make the trek up. There was no one else there when we arrived and Mary stretched on the porch and I went up on the ""lookout"". This is a private cabin that the owners allow hikers to use, and what is unique is they have an outside stairway that goes up to the pitch of the roof where there is a lookout platform. The view from the platform was really nice even though it started to sprinkle and clouds were moving in. Another hiker arrived as we were having a snack, K-Tom. We chatted with him for a bit, and Mary went up to the lookout to check out the view and I decided to go up again as well.
From the Lookout we continued on trail and made it to Winturri Shelter. We considered staying in the shelter as it was sprinkling when we arrived. After chatting with K-Tom and later Calves and having our dinner we decided we would set up our tent as we were concerned about the possibility of mosquitoes.
Probably won't make it to Hanover tomorrow, but we are excited about getting to our home state of New Hampshire.","Stealth Campsite at mile1708.7

It didn't rain as much as we thought last night, so when we got up this morning the tent was only damp. 
We are a little light on food, so we had hoped to go into the On Edge Farm market, but we were too early and it was still closed. It’s supposed to rain today and I don't think we can make it all the way to Hanover, so hopefully there is a spot in West Hartford where you can stay in a woman's barn.
 At this point the trail is going mostly east, but there are lots a little mountains in the way.  You just plow straight up over them and right straight back down again. We knew we could get some extra supplies from Cloudland Farm, but as we approached one of the road crossings we saw a sign that was from two former thru-hikers from 2016. Apparently they bought a house just down the street from the road crossing and we're welcoming thru-hikers to their back porch for some snacks and drinks, so we decided we would walk down and take a peek.
Oh my God, when we made our way around back to the porch there was a refrigerator with some cold drinks, homemade whoopie pies and brownies, and some other goodies including hard boiled eggs. We decided to enjoy a couple whoopie pies, and pack out a couple hard boiled eggs for breakfast in the morning.
We were sitting on the porch enjoying the whoopie pies when Loon, one of the hikers came out to chat with us while he was working on his porch. After we chatted a while about the projects he and his wife have going on with their old cape and we finished our whoopie pies we decided we better move on. 
Loon told us the next climb we had coming up  wasn't as bad as it looked on the profile map, but I think he was trying to be easy on us because it was a killer. When we made it up over the hill and back down the other side we came to another road crossing where we could hike up to the Cloudland Farm. Cloudland Farm is an organic beef farm, but they also have a restaurant they operate 4 days a week as well as a little farm stand. We went into the farm stand where they had a couple of pulled pork sandwiches in the refrigerator. We each got a sandwich and a cold organic soda. 
The restaurant is a beautiful post and beam barn looking building that sits up in a beautiful field overlooking the mountains. We sat on the surrounding porch and enjoyed our meal just as rain began to fall. We put on our rain gear and headed out.
 Even though it was a little cooler today it didn't take long before we were sweating heavily heading uphill in our rain gear. It rained pretty hard, but we were determined to make it down into West Hartford where we hoped to have a dry place in the barn.
When we finally made it to West Hartford, the dry oasis we were hoping for turned out to be less than satisfactory. The barn turned out to be quite cluttered,  and not what I would call the cleanest of living quarters, I'm sure the owner has a big heart and is trying to help out hikers, but we decided it was not a place we wanted to stay.
We were both pretty tired after hiking a big day in the rain, but there really wasn't anything we do we could do but hike on. After checking the map we could see there was a campsite about a mile and a half ahead next to a stream, so that's what we headed for. Made it there quickly, set up, had something to eat and both crashed in the tent hoping the rain wouldn't last too long.","Winturri Shelter

We had expected more rain last night but really didn't get it, so when we woke up this morning things were actually pretty dry.
After being disappointed last night we were excited to be heading into town and getting to our home state today. We quickly broke down camp  and ate our hard boiled eggs and hit the Trail. We still had over six and a half miles to do before we got to town, and as always several ups and downs stood in the way. 
Almost immediately after we exited the woods in Norwich we came to a driveway that had a cooler and a couple lawn chairs that said trail magic. Even though we were pretty close to our car we couldn't pass up a couple of ice cold cokes and chairs to rest in, so we sat down and enjoyed them.  As we were enjoying them the owner came home and up his driveway. We gave a wave and a big thank you. 
As we arrived in town we stopped to read the sign about Norwich. A guy came by with a timber frame shirt on and Alan ask him about his shirt. We chatted with him for a while and he told us about the area homes that were timber frame and which ones have been added onto.
We did the two mile road walk through Norwich over the Connecticut River and into Hanover. Of course we stopped on the bridge at the Vermont New Hampshire border and took several pictures. It is hard to believe, but we’ve walked from Georgia all the way back to our home state of New Hampshire. We are extremely excited to be back home. 
Once we got in Hanover the first thing we did was go down to the pizza shop that offered thru-hikers a free slice of pizza. Of course once in there we had to order another slice of pizza and a beer to go with our free slice. Once we finished it was up to Joe's bakery where they offer for you a free pastry. We couldn't resist the crullers. Mary had a maple and mine was chocolate. With our appetite mildly curbed, we decided we better get the car and head for home as we have a lot of chores to do.
Once we got home we cleaned and dried  our gear and tried to get things organized for the next couple days of slackpacking. If all goes well we should be able to slackpack a good portion of New Hampshire with the help of family and friends.","Tent site at Podunk Brook

We put one vehicle at the Lyme Dorchester Road, then headed over to Hanover  to start where we left off. I dropped Mary off at the trailhead then headed over to park the car. It was about a 15 to 20-minute walk back to the trail, so Mary had a good head start.
 The trail was pretty mellow this morning, but we did have a few climbs up over Velvet Rocks and then Moose Mountain. It took me quite a while to catch Mary, and when I finally caught her I gave her the bad news. We planned to hike 17 miles  today, but when I actually looked at the app I realized I had miscalculated and it was going to be over 19. 
We hustled along most of the day as we knew when we got done we still had to reposition the cars. It was a struggle the last few miles and we wished we had parked the car at one of the earlier road crossings, but we did get it done and managed to get out before dark. 
When we finished we drove back over to Hanover picked up the car then shuttled our other vehicle back to tomorrow's pickup spot.

We didn't get too ambitious today as we had to get over Cube mountain and Smarts Mountain. We  parked the car at 25A and headed back to where we ended yesterday. 
It was a little rainy and misty in the morning so it made the climbs a little difficult, but it was supposed to get better as the day went on. We made it up Smarts Mountain which was fairly difficult, but there was no view so we didn't bother going up the fire tower. We had lunch on the cabin steps before starting up the trail for Cube. 
Cube is another pretty good climb and had some open ledgy areas that are Mary’s “favorite”, but we managed to get to the top and have some pretty good views. By the time we got down it was pretty late again and we still had to go grab the other vehicle.
We grabbed a quick bite to eat at the Lyme General store then brought both vehicles home as we pretty much had to drive right by our house to reposition. Not sure what we'll do tomorrow as it would be too long a day to start from where we left off and get up over Moosilauke, but too short if we stop before, so we'll decide that tonight.","Lyme Dorchester Road

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601124,"We decided today that since the weather is supposed to be good we will try to get the Mount Moosilauke leg done. This will just leave a small gap that we will finish up soon, hopefully. 
We decided to leave a vehicle at 25 C and jump up to Kinsman Notch, this way we could do Mount Moosilauke southbound which would give us the steep, slippery climb up rather than coming down late in the day. 
Due to the recent rain the brook was running quite well and it was very scenic to hike along beside it. Of course the climb is very steep with lots of rock steps and some wooden blocks that are screwed into the side of the rock. Again not some of Mary's favorite trail, but like a trooper she got up over it.
As the trail started to level off we met another hiker who goes by the trail name Half Slow.  He has taken a poem by Rudyard Kipling, I believe it might be called If, and changed the first and last lines slightly. He recited the whole thing to us from memory. 
We had met Half Slow briefly on our first day slackpacking. I think he might be being assisted by Miss Janet. 
We'd hoped it would clear up by the time we reached the top, but it was still socked in with fog with just brief glimpses of the valley below. It was kind of nice going southbound because when we did reach the peak we saw Waterboy, Carly (her trail name is Bean), and a few other hikers that we knew up there. We chatted with them for a while and got filled in on where others are along the trail.
Finally we left the summit and made the descent down to where our car was parked. The trail down the back side isn't as steep, but it's still quite tough on the knees.
By the time we got down to the bottom Mary’s knees were very sore. We found a great pool down near the shelter and we both decided to go in for a quick soak. We were both pretty tired, and on the way back to our car again we wished we had parked at the parking lot for the Moosilauke trailhead rather than the parking lot at 25 C.
When we reached Oliverian Brook we had to take off our shoes to ford the brook. We didn't have our crocs with us, so we proceeded carefully across in our bare feet. We met a couple (Bill & Joanne) who are currently working on red-lining the trails listed in the White Mountain Guide. They were coming across the brook from the opposite direction. We stopped to chat with them for a bit before continuing on.
We still needed to go up over Mount Mist and at the end the day we really weren't looking forward to it. By the time we got back to our car was getting late and we still had to go back around to collect the truck. When we got back over there we decided we would go down into Lincoln and go get a burger and a beer before we headed home.
 It's been some pretty big days, and shuttling the car around has been a little tougher than we thought. It has been taking more time to move the cars around, so we're not sure what we'll do tomorrow. But again, a shower at the end of a long day and sleeping in one's own bed has its benefits.","Kinsman Notch

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601126,"Since it was going to be really hot today and we got home late last night we decided it might be better to just to clean up that little gap that we have. So today we just had to hike between 25C and 25A which was just under 5 miles.
It's kind of a pain positioning two cars for just a 5 mile hike, but we decided we didn't want to leave this gap for later on in the hike and have to worry about it.
Again we went southbound today, so we got to meet a few hikers that we hadn't seen before.  Just before we finished we did meet an older guy. ""Bag of Tricks"", parked with his pickup truck beside the road doing trail magic. He was offering beer, but we declined as it was still pretty early in the day and we really didn't think we needed any. We also met Prick today. He is a thru hiker and got his name when he sat on a cactus at Uncle Johnny’s in Erwin. Originally it was Prickly Butt, but it’s been shortened to Prick.
Even though it was early in the day when we finished it didn't stop us from getting ice cream in Warren. Hopefully doing a short day today will help us, because tomorrow we have a pretty big day planned going up and over the Kinsman's.

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601127,"We got going really early this morning because it's a pretty big day up over the Kinsman's and we had to place a car on Franconia Notch and then head back up to Kinsman Notch to start the hike. 
We started the climb up out of the notch heading towards Mount Wolf. I had not really seen the fire damage that was done from last year's fire, but it's quite extensive. I can only imagine what they had to deal with on such steep terrain trying to contain it. 
When you think of this leg of the journey it's easy to forget about Mount Wolf. Both Kinsman's are 4,000 footers, but Mount Wolf is no easy climb to get up and over either.
We finally made it up and over Wolf and headed down towards the Eliza Brook Shelter where we decided we'd have lunch. Rather than actually eat at the shelter we decided to eat lunch while we soaked our feet in the stream. 
After lunch we started up the Kinsman's following a series of falls and cascades which we wish we had more time to enjoy. By the time we arrived at South Kinsman the weather was starting to look kind of threatening, and the climb up South Kinsman as I remembered from past hikes is very steep and rocky. Again the climb had some steep Rocky open areas that Mary wasn't too thrilled with, but she put her head down and didn't look back too much and we kept going. When we were about halfway up the climb of South Kinsman we started to hear the first grumbles and rumbles of thunder. We met another Northbound hiker, Late Start,  just as we reached the summit. Like us she wasn’t too thrilled to be above treeline in the thunderstorm. 
We didn't spend much time at the top of South Kinsman as the only view was of the impending storm. We hustled to make it to the summit of North Kinsman as fast as we could. Just as we reached the summit of North Kinsman the storm was fairly close and we could see quite a few flashes of lightning. At one point I decided to take a picture, and it was so dark that the flash on my camera went off and startled Mary, she thought it was lightning. 
Mary and I and Late Start hustled as fast as we could to try to get down off the summit and down into tree line. It was hard to go too fast as it was quite slippery from the rain and in many places it was steep, flat rock. We finally made it down to Lonesome Lake campsite and I took refuge under the caretakers tent. Talking with Late Start a little more we realized that she had been moving too slowly today to make her shuttle back to her hostel, so we offered her a ride if she was around when we arrived at the parking lot.
The storm passed and we began the descent  the rest of the way down the mountains. It's pretty steep terrain down to Lonesome Lake Hut, so it took us some time. The final trail from Lonesome Lake Hut down to the road isn't too bad, but it was getting late in the day so we stuck together with Late Start  for the final couple miles. 
As we approached 93 it was getting so dark that we needed to put our headlamps on for the last quarter mile to avoid stumbling on the rocks. The one thing we had forgotten about is the trail actually comes out nearly a mile from the Liberty Springs parking lot, so once we arrived on the bike trail we had to hoof it nearly a mile down the bike trail to our car. It was quite late now and none of us had eaten so we ended up shuttling Late Start over to McDonald's before we dropped her off at the Notch Hostel. 
By the time we went back up to Kinsman Notch to retrieve our truck we realized most of the restaurants were closed, so we too ended up going to McDonalds to grab a quick bite for the ride home. 
Today was a real tough day and tomorrow will be Franconia Ridge and we won't be able to slack pack ourselves, so we may zero before we tackle it.","Kinsman Notch

 It's been great slackpacking and coming home to have a shower and sleep in our own bed, but it's been tougher than we imagined.  A lot of time is spent shuttling the cars around and we end up getting home quite late. It's been nice but we are actually looking forward to getting back out camping and just hiking during the day and deciding where we are going to camp at night, not the rest of the logistics.","Home

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601993,"Did this section southbound so we would have a better day on Franconia Ridge.
We got up early and were on the road for what was going to be only a two-day section, but our packs were still pretty heavy. We weren't really sure how we were going to get back to the trailhead, so we figured we would just run our car up there and leave it and hopefully call a family member to come pick us up when we get out in a couple days.
 We decided to do this section from Route 302 to 93 southbound because we want the day we go over Franconia Ridge to be the better day, and that would be the second day. Our day started out with pretty good trail then a quick uphill and then a nice flat trail up until Zealand hut. 
We ate lunch at Zealand, and it looked like it was going to start to rain so we gathered our gear and got moving. The trail got a lot more steep and tougher after the hut, so the going was a little slower. By the time we made it up over Zealand Mountain and Mount Guyot we were getting quite tired, but we still had North and South Twin to go. The clouds cleared a little while we were on Mount Guyot, and we got some great photos. 
We were moving pretty slow, but by the time we got to South Twin the skies had cleared again and the views were stunning. We didn't have long to enjoy them because it was starting to get dark and we still had to get down South Twin and hopefully make it somewhere to camp around the hut. 
Coming down South Twin was very steep and rocky, which Mary really does not like, especially when the rocks are kind of wet like they were tonight. Made it down just as it was getting towards sunset. I knew it was too late to do a work for stay, but I was hoping they could direct us to a stealth site near the shelter. When I inquired they said they were full up with their work for stays and we would have to move a quarter mile on out past the no camping zone and find a spot. They said there should be plenty of spots once we got going south. Reluctantly we moved on. 
We were trying to beat the dark on really rough trail south of the shelter and we didn't find a spot. We did finally come across one spot, but it was occupied and well past the quarter mile zone. We had to don our headlamp to see the trail. We came through another area where we saw tents set up and a guy sitting down with this headlight having a snack. There was a spot there half in the trail half out and we inquired if he was going to take that spot or not. He informed us to go ahead and he was going to look around for another spot. We quickly set up in the spot, cooked our dinner by headlamp, and crawled into bed. He ended up looking around for a while and then moving on by headlamp. I'm sure he wishes he took the spot. 
It was a tougher day then we had hoped, but it looks like the weather should be good for  Franconia Ridge tomorrow.","Route 302
",Garfield Ridge/Galehead Trail Junction,"Aug 09, Thu",15.30
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601994,"Even though the spot was very tight and rooty, we slept surprisingly well. We tried to get going fairly early because we knew we had a big day up over Franconia Ridge. 
Before we got to the ridge we had to go over Garfield which is very steep and very rugged. Basically the southside of Garfield is a rocky stream that you hike through. We picked our way carefully over the rocks up to the Garfield Ridge tent sites where we got some water. A short down then we started the long climb up the Northside of Lafayette. 
About halfway up Lafayette we decide to stop for lunch. While we are eating Crazy Britt, D2 and another hiker came by. We didn't recognize them until they got by, so we didn't get a chance to say hello. 
The day had started out fairly foggy when we started over Garfield, but it began to clear into a Bluebird Sky day. We made our way up above tree line and the views really became spectacular. Mary wasn't real thrilled with the open ledges, but I think the view probably made up for it. 
The Trek across the ridge was somewhat strenuous, but we couldn't ask for a nicer day. One of the benefits of going southbound was that we ran into some other hikers that we haven’t seen for quite some time. We met Taylor and Murph, and also Baygull and Tiny Bytes all coming north.
 Later in the day we started to wonder how we were going to get back to our car and eventually home. I'd hoped to contact a family member for a ride, but we hadn't had service in a while. Once up on the ridge we had service, and as always family came through. My sister agreed to come up and meet us at the trailhead and shuttle us back to our car, the question now is what time. After doing some quick figuring, knowing we had such a steep downhill to go, we figured we probably weren't going to be back to the parking lot till nearly 9. 
We hustled, but once again by the time we came down to the trailhead and took the bike path down to the parking area it was almost 9:30. We ended our day by headlamp, but like a trooper my sister was sitting there waiting and gave us a ride back to our car. Just as we pulled out on to the road Mary yelled “moose!” A large moose crossed the road and ran into the woods. My sister caught a glimpse of the back of the moose as she was following behind us.
By the time we made our way back to 302 to pick up our vehicle and head back home most restaurants we're closed. We did find one in Lincoln where we could grab a quick bite to eat. By the time we made it back to our house it was nearly midnight, but my sister had a little further to go so I'm sure she got to bed late also. We can't thank her enough for coming up to get us on such short notice. 
We're exhausted after such a long day hiking and will probably end up zeroing tomorrow before we tackle the presidentials.","Garfield Ridge/Galehead Trail Junction
",Liberty Springs Trailhead,"Aug 10, Fri",12.40
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601995,"We didn't end up zeroing after all, but we didn't get a very early start either, so we did a short day today. 
One more time we drove up to the trailhead in our car and we'll have a family member pick it up and bring it back to our house. This will be the last time we're driving ourselves around until we get back from Katahdin. 
It was almost noon when we got to the Ripley Falls parking area, and it was quite crowded, so we had to find a spot to park on the side of the road. As always, with heavy packs we started up a real steep Hill. Webster Cliffs are famously steep and it was quite warm, so we struggled our way up the trail. When we finally made it up to the cliffs we were rewarded with a nice view. 
The trail flattens out for a bit, but this doesn't last long. Soon you actually start to climb Webster which is very steep and rocky and hand over hand climbing in many places. Mary was not having fun, but with a little help we got her up over the tough spots and made our way up to Mizpah Hut/ Nauman tent sites. It was getting late and it was also the weekend, so when we got to the campsites they were basically full. We didn't even bother checking for a work for stay at Mizpah because one, we have to get going early tomorrow, and two we could see a lot of thru-hikers milling around that we're already doing work for stay. 
When we checked with the caretaker at Nauman tent sites she informed us they were full but she could put us in the overflow. The overflow turned out to be a tiny place in the woods which was neither very level or very big. Nonetheless, we were able to set up our tent, cook dinner, and be ready for an early start tomorrow morning when we head up over Washington. Lots of other hikers here tonight as this is kind of the staging point to get up and over the presidentials. Calves is here, Chaco, and several others. 
Will be going early tomorrow because it'll be a big day for us to get up over the presidentials and down towards Madison somewhere.","Route 302 (Ripley Falls Parking Area)
",Mizpah Hut/ Nauman tent sites,"Aug 11, Sat",6.40
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601996,"We were up bright and early this morning even though it was misting a little when we woke.
We made pretty good time this morning even though some of the bare rock was wet and slippery from the mist. We just took our time and were careful. Quite a few of the other thru-hikers had passed us by the time we made it to Lake of the clouds Hut, but we were happy that when we did get there we were told by the other thru-hikers that they had saved us some leftover breakfast. Usually the hut crew will let the thru-hikers eat all the leftover breakfast from the paying customers. It would have been easy for the thru-hikers to polish off the leftovers, but we were happy to see they remembered us and saved us some. 
We all chatted for a bit then one by one we left all heading for the summit of Mount Washington. The day wasn't as great as we hoped, mostly fog and in and out of the mist. 
As we made the climb up to Washington it looked like it may start to clear so we removed our rain jackets. However, as we approached the summit the clouds and mist rolled back in and we were starting to get wet and cold with the wind. When we finally reached the summit building we went downstairs to the pack room and took our rain gear off to try to dry it out.
Most everyone was upstairs grabbing a quick bite to eat, we joined them and had slices of pizza with chili and soup. We stayed long enough to eat our fill, charge our phones, warm up a bit and then we figured we better get moving. We took the summit photo, but it didn't come out very well as there was so much rain on the camera lens. 
It was so foggy and we had trouble finding the trail to start across the ridge. Once we got moving there were no views and it was pretty much hiking cairn to cairn. Hiking across the presidentials is pretty much walking on large rock slabs, sometimes they are laid flatter than others. 
With the rocks being so wet today Mary hiked carefully so as not to twist an ankle or slide off the rock down into the crevices between. Our progress was slow as we picked our way across the Gulf Side Trail. The more we hiked the more tired Mary became, and we were beginning to wonder if we could make Madison hut at all before dark. 
Mary was exhausted by the time we dragged ourselves down into Madison Hut just before dark. We inquired from the hut master what we should do as we were too tired to move on and whether we could do a work for stay. After some consultation she said they were full, but we could do a work for stay but we would have to do morning chores. It wasn't ideal as we wanted to get going early, but we really didn't have a choice so we agreed. 
Once they were cleaned up after the paying guests and the crew had eaten it was the thru-hikers turn to eat. We all got a pretty good portion and we're happy to be in where it was warm and dry. The one thing the huts need to do a little better is have a little more control of how they do their work for stays. After we had been granted the work for stay several other hikers came in without asking the hut crew anything and just set their mats up on the floor and stayed the night. The same hikers got up in the morning and left without doing anything. 
All in all it may not be a very fair system but at least we were warm and dry for the night. Tomorrow we'll make it down to Pinkham Notch where we have reservations to be picked up by the Rattle River hostel so we can get a shower, do our laundry, and eat some good food.","Mizapah (Nauman Campsite)
",Madison Hut,"Aug 12, Sun",12.20
Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601997,"All in all it wasn't the best night sleep as the hut was very crowded.  I think there were 12 thru hikers, and there was a lot of snoring going on and it was awful noisy compared to what we are used to. 
We got packed up and waited for the paying guests to eat, then once everything was cleaned up the thru-hikers were allowed to eat. The hikers who had done the evening chores were free to go, but the ones that were assigned morning chores had to do theirs. Mary and I were assigned sweeping out the bunk rooms and folding all the blankets the proper way and putting them back on the beds.
The hut crew does a little skit showing the guests how to fold their blankets, though I would estimate only about 50% actually do it. It takes longer than you think because I think there are 48 bunks with three blankets a piece. 
Once we did our chores we were free to go at around about 9:30 or quarter of 10. We began the climb up Mount Madison which is basically a boulder scramble more than a hike. Mary has done this climb before and really didn't like it, but this time she had to do it with a full pack, which she liked even less. We made it to the top with a little hand-holding and prodding and then it was time for the descent. 
The Appalachian Trail descends Mount Madison over a long exposed ridge back down towards Pinkham Notch. Going down was agonizingly slow as we picked our way through the boulders and headed down towards Pinkham. We had to be at Pinkham by 5 and figured we had plenty of time. Surprisingly the descent took a lot out of us and we just barely made it. 
We stopped for a quick lunch down by the Osgood tent site and then hustled the best we could over the somewhat easier terrain towards Pinkham Notch. When we finally arrived at Pinkham we saw Crush waiting at the lodge, he informed us that the shuttle had already been called and would be there shortly. We were happy to have made it, and we were glad to be on our way to the Rattle River hostel. 
The Rattle River hostel is a well-run hostel. As you arrive you leave your shoes outside, your pack stays in the entry room, and you shower and put on clean clothes before even being allowed inside to see the accommodations. Inside everything is clean and nice and you have the entire house at your disposal. A couple of section hikers were finishing their section and had cooked up burgers and hotdogs, and had potato salad and some beer for everyone at the hostel tonight. After a tough couple of days it was just what we needed, a shower and some down time talking with the other hikers and some much-needed rest.

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601998,"We got a 7:30 shuttle back to the trailhead at Pinkham Notch. Mary's been worrying about doing the section of trail up over Wildcat for some time now, but after a full belly of pancakes from the hostel she is as ready as she'll ever be. 
Wildcat Ridge Trail is another very steep trail with lots of rock steps and two or three areas of open ledge, some of which have some rebar you have to get over. 
Lots of thru-hikers on the trail this morning, many of which are doing a slack pack from Pinkham Notch back to the rattle run hostel which is 20 something miles, and a very strenuous hike. That's too much for us to do and there are very few bail out points, so we're doing it over two days with our full packs. With a little help Mary made it up and over the ledges and soon we were up on the ridge bouncing along towards the gondola. 
As we neared the summit of Wildcat and climbed up to the viewing platform we started to hear some rumbles of thunder and saw dark clouds off to the north. We didn't linger long on the peak, but started making our way across the ridge to the other peaks. The storm never really reached us, and soon the weather started to look a little better but the trail didn't, lots of ups and downs many of them with bare rock that was quite slippery and had long steps for short legs. 
When we made it to Carter Notch Hut we decided we would use our orange card that the AMC gives out to thru-hikers when they stay at a campsite. An orange card entitles thru-hikers to 50% off future campsite stays, and a couple of free baked goods at the huts along with a free bowl of soup. 
Carter Notch was being staffed by AMC volunteers who were former caretakers in the past. They didn't seem to know anything about the orange cards, but gladly gave us a bowl of soup with fresh homemade bread. They also cut the dessert for the evening, making sure they had enough for paying guests, and gave us each a one of the chocolate chip cookie bars. It was fun talking to the older gentleman as I'm sure they were reminiscing about the old times when they worked as caretakers. It sounds like many of them were caretakers 20 years ago. Snow angel, a new thru-hiker we recently met, was at the hut along with Crush when we got there. Also at the hut was a young hiker from Germany that we met at the hostel. He is hiking the White Mountain section of the AT and is staying at this hut as well as a couple of the other huts.
The weather looked okay so we decided we better try to make a few more miles before we were done for the day. We started up the long climb out of the notch up Carter Dome. About a quarter mile up the climb I realized I left my wallet sitting back at the hut so I quickly dropped my pack and ran back to the hut to get it. I actually did run back to the hut and grab my wallet and started running back up the trail when I met the hiker from Germany, he seemed dumbfounded that I was running on the trails. 
As I started back up the climb I met , Chaco, Calves and Godfather who we're just coming into the hut, I didn't stop to talk long because I wanted to catch up to Mary. We made it up to Carter Dome, down into Zeta  Pass and then up to Mount Height. We figured we would set up camp for the evening. 
We found a small area just prior to the alpine zone, when we arrived Snow Angel already had her tent setup there, and we decided to join her for the evening. We quickly setup then decided we would cook dinner up on Mount Height and enjoy the view and possibly a sunset. We ate, but it started to get quite cold and windy and it didn't look like the sunset was going to be all that great so we stayed for a while then headed back down to our tent. 
We settled in for the evening and soon the wind picked up. It wasn't long before we saw flashes of lightning and heard thunder. Suddenly were wishing we didn't camp up so high. I had phone service so I quickly checked the radar only to find out there were severe thunderstorm warnings in the area. I got out the to batten down the tent a little more securely and climbed in hoping it wasn't going to be too bad. Turns out the wind picked up, thunder rumble a little, and we had a brief downpour, but it never really got too bad. 
Tomorrow we'll finish the hike down into Rattle Run and then we'll be on to Maine.","Pinkham Notch

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602000,"The storm never really materialized last night, but it was quite windy all night. When we woke this morning it was really cold.
Everything was fogged in this morning, so we didn't get many views, and of course the trail was quite rough again with lots of ups and downs and slick, wet rock. We talked with snow angel and she too was a little nervous about the storm last night, fortunately there was no real danger. 
We finally made our way over to North Carter and soon realized that North Carter has some steep drops where most of the trail has eroded away so bad that there are long stretches of slick rock where the only way down is to hang onto roots and tree branches. Mary shook her head and struggled with many of these sections, but eventually we made it down and started up towards Moriah. 
As we started up the southside of Moriah we found a nice open ledge to have lunch on. We also got out the tent and fly to dry it out from last night's rain. We made it up Moriah and then began the steep descent, once again it was slow going. Once you finally get down, the trail follows the Rattle River for quite some time. The trail was quite nice and with just a gradual descent. When Mary gets on  trail like this she can really fly, and soon we were back at the hostel enjoying a cold beer and some hot food. 
It's funny how we were so looking forward to get back to New Hampshire, but once we got here it seems to have really kicked our butts. We have done all the 4,000 footers in New Hampshire, but many times you're able to take an easier trail than the AT. Also, you only have a daypack, not a heavy multi-day pack. It's also funny that after all these miles suddenly Mary is questioning whether she can actually do this trail, it's been that tough on us. We have one more day to go in New Hampshire then will be in Maine, I keep telling Mary that we've done the toughest, but we still have some more tough stuff to go. 
We just keep trying to string one day after another and soon we will be at the end.
Mary here - A couple times recently when the trail was very difficult for me I stated “I have no business being on this trail!” Alan is always patient and manages to calm me down and get me through the tough spots.

We left today with pretty full packs on for the next leg we have to get over. We eased into it today with a road walk and a fairly gentle climb, but soon we were right back into it with bare ledge scrambles that Mary so enjoys. 
We played leapfrog today with many of the hikers we've been hiking around: Snow Angel, Crush, Prick,Chaco, and Calves. Kind of an uneventful day as everyone is looking forward to Mahoosuc Notch in a couple days. 
Per usual we were the last ones to arrive at camp tonight, but I was pleased to see that when we got there we were offered some trail magic that was left in the bear box. Some cookies and candy bars were left in the bear box and the other hikers were thoughtful enough to save us a chocolate bar for when we arrived at camp. Prick also gave me a Ginger/Turmeric  tea bag to try.

Still raining lightly when we woke so we had breakfast at the campsite. By the time we finished breakfast it was no longer raining so we picked up our wet gear and headed out for the day.
Even though it was only 4 miles to the Maine border it took us until almost lunch time to get there. We had a climb up Mt Success, and the trail was wet with bog bridges and slippery rocks. After Mt Success there was a steep section where Mary decided to take off her pack so she could make the decent more easily. Snow Angel caught us in this section and we all made it to the Maine border shortly after. An amazing feeling reaching the final state!
When we arrived at the Maine border we decided it was a good time to have lunch, Snow Angel was having her lunch just off trail. We asked her if there were any logs or rocks to sit on, she said no, so we found a spot along the trail to sit and ""enjoy"" lunch. I had spam, Mary had peanut butter with ""marshmallow cream"", which is nothing like fluff. Too sweet, and she says it tastes like they melted marshmallows in a jar and added too much sugar!
As we continued along the trail we came to ledges dropping down into Carlo Col. Apparently this is a precursor to what the climb up Katahdin will include. Mary did not enjoy this short, steep, rock section that you have to scramble hand over hand (at one point we turned around to make our way down backwards). We had heard that a hiker had fallen in this section and actually ended with his head ""wedged"" in the rocks. At the bottom is the Carlo Col shelter, which we didn't bother taking the side trail to. 
We were already tired but we still had to get up over Goose Eye, which includes 3 peaks. I remembered this section having beautiful views from my 2011 hike, but today there were no views and it was so foggy that it was difficult to find the trail in some spots with the open ledges. The slick slab rock slowed Mary down as did the slick bog bridges. At some points you had to find away around the deep mud as the bog bridges were either swallowed by the bog or in disrepair. So far Maine has proven to be very muddy.
We had considered going through Mahoosuc Notch today if we could arrive at the start by 3:00, but due to the weather and trail conditions we were happy to make it to Full Goose Shelter. We thought the others probably would have made it through the notch, but when we arrived at the shelter they were all there. Chaco, Calves, Prick, Snow Angel, and Crush (who made the comment ""I thought you guys were going to do Mahoosuc today..."") were all already set up for the night. We also saw Izzy set up, we haven't seen here since just before Lehigh Gap.
The shelter was full, as were all the tentsites. The area was covered with blowdowns, but we managed to find a small rooty, rocky spot in amongst the other tenters to set up our tent. 
Even though it was only a 9.6 mile day, Maine continues to be tough and demanding. We cooked by headlamp tonight and headed to bed hoping to be rejuvenated enough to handle the notch tomorrow. Off to bed, we will probably both be dreaming of bogs, rocks, and fog tonight.","Gentian Pond Shelter

By the time we were up and ready to head out, the others with the exception of Izzy had already left. 
Mary was excited because before we even got to the notch we were climbing down steep rock on iron rungs and ladders still wet from the previous days rain. 
When we reached the sign for Mahoosuc Notch, I set my watch so we could see just how long it would take us to get through the mile that is either the most difficult or most fun mile on the Appalachian Trail.
Mary here: Mahoosuc""k"" Notch is a rock scramble where you have to climb up on rocks, through rock ""caves"", and sometimes take your pack off to get through tight areas. I'm very tentative on rocks, and this was a struggle for me. There are sheer cliffs on both sides, so the sun doesn't reach this section much, and at one point Alan pointed out ice that was still lingering in a spot below. I know some people really love the rock scrambles, but I don't. This section seemed to go on endlessly for me. At some points Alan had to give me a boost, other times he went first and had to pull me up. 
At one point, trying to squeeze through one of the ""tunnels"" with my pack on I got stuck. While trying to force my way through I realized I jammed the stay out the bottom of my pack. I guess I should have taken my pack off, I'll have to find a temporary fix until I can call ULA.
Once we arrived at the north end of the notch we took a well deserved break and had lunch. Our day was not over though, we still had to climb up Mahoosuc Arm which is described as one of the steepest sections of trail on the AT. Once again since this section is so steep much of the trail has eroded down to bare rock which you either have to hike up over or find an alternate way around. This made the climb both strenuous and time consuming. Part way up Mary had to take a pack off break since it was pretty warm out and she was getting a little dizzy. We were rewarded with a view once we reached the top of the arm.
After doing the notch and the arm we decided we were just going to get to the next campsite and possibly take a swim at Speck Pond. We walked around Speck Pond and made it to Speck Pond Shelter. This shelter is the highest elevation shelter on the AT in Maine, and has an AMC caretaker. We had thrown out our orange card we received back at Nauman campsites and we were hoping the caretaker would believe our story that we had stayed at an AMC site and should receive a discount here.  As I was checking in and relaying the story to the caretaker she said she recognized us, as she was the caretaker on duty the night we stayed at Nauman! So, we got our site for half price, and headed to set up our tent on a nearby platform.
Since arriving and setting up it has cooled down, so we opted to forgo the swim. Actually, we put our fleece tops on and headed to the cooking area to make dinner. The thru-hikers we have been with lately have all made it further today, but there are some section hikers in camp tonight. One of the hikers told us ""you still have Bald Pate & Bemis to go over!"", apparently thinking that those are going to be real tough climbs for us. Another asked what I thought of the Bigelows from my previous hike of the AT, I told him I thought the Bigelows seemed similar to Franconia Ridge with equally outstanding views.

We were both cold last night, nights like last night make me wish I had my 15 degree sleeping bag. Once we got up and moving and had tea and breakfast we warmed up quickly. 
Our first climb was Old Speck, Maine's third highest mountain, and another climb with exposed rock ledges that Purple Haze is not thrilled about. Once we made it through the exposed ledges the trail became easier and Purple Haze was more relaxed. On the way down into Grafton Notch we met a couple from Bethlehem NH celebrating the husbands 70th birthday. We told him he certainly didn't look 70, and wished him a happy birthday. They have done the 4,000 footers in NH and are working on Maine's peaks now
Our original plan was to make it to Andover without a resupply, however, since we've been doing less mileage due to the terrain, we are going to be short a dinner and certainly snacks. As we hiked we decided we would need to hitch into Bethel to purchase enough food to make it to Andover.
As luck would have it, as we approached Grafton Notch Parking lot I saw a small sign on a tree that said ""Trail Magic at the Prius"". In the far corner of the parking lot was a Prius with an easy-up set up. A couple greeted us as we approached the easy-up. Right off I thought I recognized the guy, and asked him his trail name. He said ""Bear Sweatz"", and I said ""I thought I recognized you, we hiked together in Maine in 2011!"" Bear Sweatz remembered hiking with Mammoth and I, and after the AT he went on to hike the PCT, and then re-hiked the AT in 2016 with his wife ""Tuff Broad"". They were planning on doing the CDT this year, but since ""Tuff Broad"" is pregnant, they could only hike as long as their doctor recommended. So, not only did they have trail magic, but they also had brought their remaining food drop items remaining from their CDT hike. We enjoyed a couple hot dogs and sodas, and then selected some snacks and a dinner to get us to Andover. They had small containers of parmesan cheese, as well as some dehydrated veggies that we thought we be a good addition to our dinner. 
Can't thank Bear Sweatz and Tuff Broad enough for providing double trail magic. One a morale boosting meal and two saving us a 12 mile hitch in to Bethel and another hitch back which would have taken us the majority of the remainder of the day. We stayed and chatted with them for an hour or so before we finally headed back out on the trail. 
As we were making our way back across the parking lot we saw ""Bugs"" and ""Jeans"" spread out on the pavement. We asked how their slackpack over Moriah Wildcat Ridge went, and they told us not too good. Apparently ""Shirtpants"" twisted his ankle and is taking some time off trail to heal. We told them there was trail magic at the other end, and Bear Sweatz and Tuff Broad were looking for other hikers to enjoy their hot dogs etc... Jeans had thought it might be trail magic, but they hadn't seen the sign. They immediately headed down to enjoy some hot dogs and beverages.
The hike up Baldpate West Peak wasn't too bad. It's a gradual climb and has a mostly tree-covered summit. Purple Haze likes climbs where she has trees around her better than those with exposed rock. Unfortunately Baldpate East Peak is open slab, and it took some handholding to get Purple Haze to the summit. The summit was beautiful with amazing 360 degree views. We took a break and enjoyed a snack while enjoying the views. The decent starts out not too bad, but then the trail becomes very steep with more exposed rock for trail. It was a slow descent as we made our way down to Frye Notch Lean-to.
We arrived fairly late, and area had very few suitable tent sites. We finally decided on a spot right next to the trail and set up. Bugs & Jeans were set up in the shelter with a couple other hikers, one being a southbounder. Great water source, clear and cold. Quick dinner, once again it is getting dark and I hung the bear bag by headlamp. Off to bed, hoping to get to the second road crossing before we go into Andover tomorrow.
Note from Mary: Amazingly enough, there were no other hikers to be seen as we hiked Baldpate today. I can only imagine if anyone had seen us hiking hand in hand over the slabs, maybe they would have thought ""how romantic, look at them hiking hand in hand"". And, I guess it was romantic in a way, so much love holding hands and hiking the AT.","Speck Pond Shelter & Campsite

We got up early today, and we were the first hikers back on trail. We decided to wait and enjoy tea further down the trail. We ate our Pop-tarts we picked up at the trail magic before heading out.
When we reached Dunn Cascades we decided it would be a nice spot for tea, and we certainly could use the caffeine boost as well. We didn't stay too long at the falls because our plan was to make it to South Arm Road to get picked up so we can resupply in Andover. There is no phone service at the Cascades, so we have to get some elevation to get a call out. Just after tea we came upon a beautiful pool at the bottom of Upper Dunn Falls.  We would have loved to take a swim in the pool, but we were worried about getting to the road in time for a shuttle. It seems we always come upon spots like this when we don't feel we have the time to enjoy them. The pool is not far from East B Hill Road, so maybe some day we can come back for a dip.
When we arrived at East B we saw a sign for the Human-Nature Hostel. The sign noted that they didn't take reservations, and the Walmart run is now at noon time. Also, it mentioned they couldn't guarantee a 5:30 pm pick-up. We crossed the road and continued on the trail which headed up Wyman Mountain where we hoped we would have cell phone service so we could get a call into a hostel. As luck would have it, shortly after we were able to get a call into the Human-Nature Hostel. Unfortunately, the message confirmed what the sign said and we were unable to speak with anyone, so we were not sure that would be an option for us. When you reach South Arm Road it is 8 miles into town, and the road does not have much traffic. We decided to call the other hostel, Pine Ellis, and see if they had room available and could pick us up at South Arm. They had a private room, which we reserved, and they said to call at the top of Moody Mountain to let them know when we would arrive at South Arm Road (where there is no cell phone service).
Wyman Mountain was a gradual climb, but descends steeply into Sawyer Notch. We decided we would have a quick snack and soak our feet in Sawyer Brook before tackling the last mountain which we knew was going to be steep. As we made our way up, at times using rebar and at other times climbing steps we met a couple different groups of trail maintainers working on the trails. One of the groups had AmeriCorps t-shirts. They were adding more rock steps, which will help prevent erosion and make the climb more enjoyable. We thanked them for their work and continued on our way.
As we neared the top of Moody Mountain we met a southbound hiker who said it was steep coming up, and had heard that the descent southbound was easier. We didn't have the heart to tell her how steep her descent was going to be. We did let her know that she would come upon some trail maintainers. Made it to the top and as Mary started the descent I put a call into Pine Ellis to let them know we were heading down to the road. I actually also received a text from Human-Nature Hostel saying they could pick us up at South Arm. I sent them a text telling them that we had already reserved a room at another hostel and headed down the mountain.
We had a short wait for the shuttle, and as we were waiting a guy came by in a pickup truck and actually offered us a ride. We politely declined, letting him know the shuttle was on its way. Mary stretched and not too much later the van from Pine Ellis arrived to take us back to the hostel. When we arrived we saw that Bugs, Jeans, Crazy Brit, D-squared and a few other hikers were already settled in at the hostel. Bugs and Jeans decided they would come into Andover after hearing us talk about the hostel. They are planning a slackpack for tomorrow. 
We were really hungry, so as soon as we could get our shower (we had to wait for someone in the shower) we headed over to the restaurant with Bugs and Jeans for Cheeseburgers, fries and chocolate milk. We grabbed a six pack of IPA's to enjoy back at the hostel. We sat on the hostel porch and chatted with all the other hikers and eventually got our laundry done. It is supposed to rain tomorrow, so we are thinking we may zero, possibly at the Human-Nature Hostel. Crazy Brit and D-squared are going to slackpack Baldpate tomorrow, a couple other hikers, including ""Mud"", who we just met, are also planning the same slack. Not something I would be excited to do in the rain.
Decided to call the Human-Nature Hostel, and we have a bed reserved there for tomorrow night. So, we can resupply at Walmart tomorrow, and relax there. This hostel has received several good reviews on Guthooks, and sounds like a good place to zero in the rain. Off to bed.","Frye Notch Lean-to

The owner of the Human-Nature Hostel agreed to pick us up this morning at the restaurant, so we headed there for breakfast and to wait for our ride. Another hiker was waiting for Human-Nature Hostel to pick her up as well. When the shuttle arrived, it was already raining, they only had room for two but said another shuttle would arrive soon. The other hiker was kind enough to let us take the first shuttle.
We arrived at Human-Nature Hostel to find most of the group we had fallen behind already there, Chaco, Calves, Prick, Crush, M & M Franklinstein, Flyballs, as well as some other hikers.  Human-Nature Hostel is a brand new geodesic dome that the owner (Yukon who thru-hiked the AT in 2012) built specifically to be a hostel. Eventually he plans to build separate bunk houses and the dome will be the common area. But for now he has a bunk room downstairs, a private room, and a loft area for couples upstairs. They have indoor bathrooms, but also have outdoor showers along with some outdoor porta-potties to help reduce stress on the septic system. Very comfortable and clean hostel. Again another hostel where your stinky gear stays outside and you shower immediately when you arrive.
Enjoyed a relaxing day and took a trip on the shuttle bus to Walmart. On the bus ride we got to watch old music videos on a tv mounted at the front of the bus. That evening we enjoyed an amazing taco dinner put on by the owner and his helpers. We also had some snickers pie for dessert.
Off to bed, back to the trail tomorrow. Looking forward to AYCE Blueberry pancakes in the morning!","Pine Ellis Hostel

We were up early so we could get our packs ready before the AYCE Blueberry Pancake breakfast. Yukon was making the pancakes, and he took the time to put the Appalachian Trail symbol on them. 
As we were waiting for the pancakes, Mary mentioned that one of the thru-hikers at the hostel looked like “Jedmorgensen”, a hiker we hadn’t seen since Georgia. He was getting a cup of coffee so we walked over to ask him his trail name. He said “Jed”, and Mary replied “Jedmorgensen”? He said yes, most people don’t remember the complete name! We introduced ourselves and it didn’t take him long to remember who we were even though we had not seen him since Whitley Gap. He is now hiking southbound after flipping up to Katahdin. We got our pancakes, they were amazing by the way, and sat on a couch to enjoy them. The pancakes were quite large, and you could top them with hot blueberries in a “sauce”, as well as maple syrup. In fact, the pancakes were so large we each only ate 1 1/2 of them. We chatted for quite some time with “Jed” as we ate, and got a picture with him as well.
At 8:30 we loaded onto the bus with Chaco, Calves, Prick, Franklinstein & Flyballs. Once back at the trailhead we said our goodbyes to our shuttle driver and headed up the trail. Prick had already headed up the trail and we were soon passed by the others.
Today we hiked up Old Blue Mountain (elevation 3,599), which has some rock slab, as well as rock with metal rungs to help you climb up some steep rock. The weather was great, and we had some nice views even though the summit is mostly wooded.
A few miles after Old Blue Mountain is Bemis Mountain (elevation 3,563) followed in another few miles by Bemis Mountain Second Peak (elevation 2,881). By the time we reached Bemis Mountain Second Peak it was around 7:00, and it was starting to get dark. Knowing the descent was going to be steep, we decided to set up camp on the summit. We found a somewhat level spot on the rock slab, and with the wind blowing attempted to set up the tent. After grabbing several nearby rocks to hold things in place we had our tent up and could now concentrate on getting dinner cooked, the bearbag hung, and getting into our sleeping bags for the night. We did enjoy a little bit of a sunset here as well.Note from Mary: I added a little note after the fact on our August 20th journal entry, incase you are interested.","South Arm Road

We didn't sleep too well due to the constant wind and the fact that what looked like a somewhat level spot was actually quite tipped. I did however finally try putting my spare clothing under my sleeping pad to try to level it out and it worked amazingly well. Unfortunately, I didn't come to this realization until about 5:30 in the morning. But, at least I will know to do this in the future should we have another unlevel site.
After tea and a quick breakfast we started the somewhat steep descent. After fording Bemis Stream we started the climb up to Maine Route 17. The road affords a beautiful view, and their is actually a bench to sit on. 
We hiked on the ridge along Long Pond before finally coming to the East End which provided a sandy beach where we decided we would have our lunch and take a swim. There was a wooden ""step structure?"" that we thought we could sit on to enjoy our lunch. Unfortunately, the boards for the ""seat"" were not nailed down. Mary sat too far out on the end and soon found herself on the ground. After lunch we took a leisurely swim, and the water was not only refreshing but quite clean. It seems many hikers are concerned about swimming due to leeches, however we didn't see any here.
Since we were trying to make more miles today, we hiked until The Little Swift River Pond Campsites and decided to stop there as we needed water and Mary needed to stretch. It was getting late, so we also decided to have dinner here as well. There was a large group of Harvard students camping here (Orientation?), as well as at least one thru-hiker. 
We were hoping to find a stealth site next to Chandler Mills Stream Pond, however when we arrived there was already someone set up with their hammock. The area was rooty and rocky along the trail, with little place to set up a tent. Using Guthooks, we decided to continue further along the trail to a spot mentioned in the comments. Guthooks mentioned a hammock spot with a view up ahead, and another poster said there were a few tent sites .3 past the view. Hiking with our headlamps, we finally came to a spot that looked suitable with the exception of a big, dead, birch tree nearby. I was able  to push the dead tree over, thus feeling better about setting up our tent here. It was actually a nice soft, flat site. 
Hung the bear bag, brushed our teeth, and off to bed.","Stealth Campsite on Bemis Mountain Second Peak

I woke up with a sore, scratchy throat this morning. I'm hoping it is nothing, maybe just need more fluids. We actually slept really well last night, the site was soft with pine needles. Packed up and headed toward route 4, we are low on fuel and hope to pick up a canister at the Hiker Hut which is only 3 tenths off the trail. Got to the road and saw ""Carpenter"" and another hiker trying to hitch into Rangeley for a resupply.  Mary decided to hike on while I headed to the hostel to get the canister.
The Hiker Hut seemed like a neat little place. It is off grid, they have a couple bunkhouses and offered a small resupply. The owner was sitting outside when I arrived and was quickly able to get me a canister, and I decided to pick up some Pop-tarts as well. The Hiker Hut has a ""pet"" chipmunk you can feed, and when I arrived the owner and another hiker were doing just that. As I headed back he offered to show me a trail from his place back to the AT that would cut off 3 tenths of the AT, or another trail that would eliminate most of the road walk. I chose to eliminate the road walk, but not skip any of the AT.
Once I got back on trail I passed a family heading out to fish at Ethel Pond. Mary had stopped along the trail near Piazza Rock Lean-to to stretch, and I was thankful she did as we needed to get water. We filled up on water and started the climb toward Saddleback Mountain. As we hiked we played leap frog with a couple and their dog who were out for the day on the trail. 
Once we reached treeline on Saddleback Mountain we started a 2 1/2 mile section of trail that is totally exposed. The weather sunny and clear, and once we reached the summit we had amazing views. As we headed down we could look over and see some of the ski slopes.
After Saddleback we made our way over to the Horn. The backside of the Horn has some real steep areas which brought out the tentative side of Mary. After the Horn is Saddleback Jr, which Mary commented ""Saddleback Jr has a chip on its shoulder and has an attitude. It doesn't like being called Jr"", and so it is very steep, going straight up at times. The sore throat I woke up with has gotten worse, and I seem to also have a low grade fever and no energy so I struggled to make it to the top of Saddleback Jr. More amazing views on both the Horn as well as Saddleback Jr. 
By the time we arrived at Poplar Ridge Lean-to the it was full and most of the tent sites were taken. We went back down the trail to a spot we had seen near the privy, and set up camp there. Not a great spot, the odor from the privy wafted over at times, but we were both so tired that didn't really matter. Another night of hanging the bear bag by headlamp after cooking a quick dinner. Off to bed, hoping to feel better tomorrow.","Stealth Campsite .3 past view

I guess it's official, I'm sick. My nose is running, my throat is sore, and I have a fever. But, at least it is ""only a cold"". Picked up camp, and as I finished getting ready Mary headed up to get water near the shelter.
About 3 miles from the shelter we crossed Orbeton Stream, Sluice brook empties into the stream creating a nice little waterfall. Neither of us were feeling real energetic this morning, fortunately the trail was fairly mellow. When we arrived at Perham Stream we decided to stop for a snack and to soak our feet before starting the climb up Lone Mountain.
We made it to the top of Lone Mountain and started across the ridge. With neither of us feeling well we decided to stop at the side trail for Mount Abraham and boil water for the Lipton Cup a Soup we were carrying. Not exactly grandma's chicken soup, but it was hot and tasted pretty good. As we were sitting enjoying our soup a southbounder came along. We chatted with her and she said she had started NOBO, but flipped up in New York to Katahdin. We asked if she had met another flipflopper named ""Minnie"", and she said she had seen her at Shaw's Hostel in Monson. 
Soon after we got going again we met two more southbounders. When Mary asked if they were southbounders or flipfloppers ""Two Clicks"" replied that he had actually finished his NOBO hike and was yo-yoing. He was hiking with Pappy's granddaughter and they mentioned Pappy was coming behind them. We chatted a while and continued on and shortly came upon Pappy. We hadn't seen Pappy since Erwin, we chatted with him a bit and asked if we could get a picture with him. We didn't want to delay him too long as he has become somewhat of a celebrity on the trail and probably has to stop several time a day to get pictures taken with hikers. Good to see Pappy is still going, he is an inspiration to many and we wish him well on his endeavor.
We went by the AT Completion Marker showing that the CCC completed the final link of the trail near this spot in 1937. This spot also holds significance this year as we now have less than 200 miles to go! Shortly after we started the climb up Sugarloaf, which was a nice gradual climb. You don't actually go to the summit of Sugarloaf, but there is a half mile side trail that climbs steeply to the top. Since the weather was starting to look like rain, we skipped the summit trail and started the descent. The trail was muddy and at one point you are on a slide area followed by some rocks that we came down hand over hand backwards. This section slowed us down, and was another section that made Mary again state that she felt she had ""no business being on this trail"". She may have also used some unlady like language, but with some guidance of where to place her feet and hands, we made it down that section.
The plan today was to make it to Crocker Cirque campsites, but when we reached the South Branch of the Carrabassett River we decided to stop for the day. When we reached the river it had already rained on us once, and it looked like it was going to rain again. You cross the main channel of the river on a single board sitting on two boulders. Once we reached the other side we saw a couple of hikers setting up camp. They said there were more sites down a trail,  and it just so happens I camped here in 2011 with Mammoth. We found a fairly flat spot and quickly set up hoping to avoid getting soaked. We made a trip down to the river for a ""wash"", foot soak, and to get water.
After we ate dinner it started to mist and we quickly picked up, hung the bear bag and climbed into our tent for the evening. Mary's throat has started feeling worse, and she is developing a fever as well. We both have runny noses and lack energy, which makes it hard to get in the miles that we would like to be making. 
We put in a call today to the Hostel of Maine for a pick-up at ME Route 27. They pick up at 1:30 and 4:30, and we are hoping to make the 1:30 shuttle so we will need to get going early in the morning. Looking forward to a hot shower, town food, and rest.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to

Tried to get up and moving early this morning so we could hopefully make the 1:30 shuttle, otherwise we will have to wait until the 4:30 shuttle or hitch in. We are both feeling lousy with our colds, an the tent is slightly wet from the light rain we had.
Todays hike took us up and over South and North Crocker, a couple of 4,000 footers. Sadly not much for views today as the summits are mostly wooded. We did have some views early on heading up the rock slide on South Crocker. There is also a spur trail to views on the ""proper summit"" of South, but it was fairly foggy so we didn't see much there.
We made good time on the Crockers and before we knew it we were at ME 27. Just prior to ME 27 we reached the 2,000 mile mark of the trail! Someone had commemorated it by constructing a stick 2,000 mile marker. There were several hikers sitting at the lot and some said ""trail magic"". We thought they were just joking, but there was actually a thru-hiker from last year (Trailien) set up further along in the parking lot. He and his mom (Trail Magic Momma) had flown to Maine from Minnesota just to do trail magic. There were cold drinks, snacks, chips and more. He also gave us each a coin which said ""ups and downs"" on it for luck.
Justin, from the Hostel of Maine, arrived as we were finishing our cold drinks. We were the only two hikers being picked up on the 1:30 shuttle, and soon we were on our way. The Hostel of Maine is another new hostel on the trail. It was originally a bed and breakfast, and they have renovated it to include a couple of bunk rooms, but also still have several private rooms. There is a large common area, dining room, and kitchen. They also have an office area that is complete with resupply items. 
Justin and Melanie are continuing the trend of newer hostels that request you leave your gear outside and take a shower before getting settled in. We had a beautiful room on the second floor with two king beds and a private bathroom. We got our showers and put on our ""loaner clothing"" so we could get our laundry done.
There is a restaurant near by, unfortunately it wasn't open today. We cooked a pizza that was available, and as luck would have it Justin is a beer enthusiast and had several local craft beers available for purchase. Mary & I each selected a beer to enjoy with our pizza. After we dried our tent outside, and Justin gave me a ride down to the store on his shuttle trip to grab a few items not available here. Mary stayed behind to try to get some rest and hopefully recover a little from her cold.
Later in the evening, since the restaurant is closed, Justin does a takeout order from a restaurant in town. We each ordered their famous burger and fries, but by the time they got back most of the dinner was cold. It was still certainly better than eating dinner on the trail.
Made sure we had everything from the resupply area, and headed to bed.","South Branch Carrabassett River

When we woke, we still weren't sure what time we would get a shuttle out. We didn't want to pick too early of a time last night as we were not sure how we would be feeling. Headed down for what we thought would be a continental breakfast and found Melanie had done it up right! There was coffee, tea, orange juice, fresh orange slices, bagels, hard boiled eggs, but also an amazing French Toast Casserole. Perfect way to start the day.
We packed up and when Justin returned from an earlier shuttle we were ready to go. We are still not feeling great, but decided we should move on rather than zero.
Today was all about the Bigelows, and the weather was perfect with blue skies and a light wind. We started with a gradual climb and passed ponds and bogs as we headed up the Horn. Just before the final climb up to the summit of the Horn we stopped at the view to have lunch. We stopped at Horns Pond Lean-tos to fill up on water, Crush was already there and directed us to the water source. Mary stretched while I filled our water bottles.
Did the steep climb up over Horn where we had spectacular 360 degree views back to Horns Pond in the south as well as north to West Peak. We made a short descent before starting the climb up Bigelow West Peak. As we neared the summit of West Peak the trail became a rocky, narrow ridge and the wind really picked up. Because the wind made it difficult to walk, we decided to walk up the trail that allowed us to ""hang on"" to the ridge rather than try to stay on top of the ridge where the wind might ""blow us off"". We heard some hooting and hollering from above, and then soon joined a southbound hiker at the top. As we looked back we could see Crush wobbling his way up being buffeted by the wind. The 360 degree views from the top were spectacular, looking back nearly the entire length of Flagstaff Lake as well as South to Sugarloaf and the Crockers. The views were made all the more exhilarating with the wind pummeling us from all sides. Took a few pictures and then quickly made our way toward Avery Peak. Avery Peak is the final 4,000 footer for Northbound hikers until Katahdin.
Avery Peak has an old stone foundation that protected us from the wind so we sat down to enjoy a snack.  I quickly searched for ""Avery's Machete"" that I had found on my 2011 hike, but I couldn't seem to find it this time. The views here were just as stunning as West Peak, and certainly some of the best views of our trip so far.
We had hoped to make it to Little Bigelow Lean-to as we knew there was a possibility of swimming there. However, as we neared Safford Notch it started to sprinkle. Later we took refuge under a large boulder overhanging the trail during a brief downpour. When the rain let up we decided to head for Safford Notch Campsite where we found an empty tent platform to set up for the night. This is a well used campsite and the mice were pretty brazen here. As we at our dinner the mice were running from under the platform hoping to get some of our food crumbs, unfortunately for them hungry thru-hikers don't tend to drop much of their food.
We were both still feeling under the weather, and after a couple of tough climbs today we were ready for bed. Hung our bear bags and climbed into our bags for the night.

Still not feeling great, but at least we survived the mice last night with no issues. With our colds, we definitely needed a hot cup of tea this morning to get going.
A nice sunny day, and there were quite a few nice views to be had  as we headed over Little Bigelow Ledges. By the time we made it to Bigelow Lean-to where we hoped to be last night it was almost lunch time. So, we stopped to soak our feet in the tubs and then grabbed a quick lunch beside the trail. Crush came by as we were soaking our feet and mentioned that he got drenched last night before he was able to set up his tent.
Once we made it to the edge of Flagstaff Lake the day had heated up sufficiently and we couldn't pass up a swim at one of the beaches. The water was beautiful and we thought how nice it would be to camp here and just enjoy the lake for the day. However, after about 45 minutes we decided we better move on.
We crossed Long Falls Dam Road, another former 2,000 mile marker written in the road that someone has now crossed out the 2,000 and updated it to the true current mileage. As we stood by the road, a couple stopped to see if we were hiking the trail. We chatted with them for awhile and they mentioned that they were on their way home from enjoying a stay in one of the Maine Huts (may have been an AMC Hut, can't remember). We took turns getting our picture out in the road, and when Crush arrived we got a picture for him as well.
One little short climb and then we made our way down to West Carry Pond Lean-to. When we arrived Crush was already set up in the shelter along with a couple other hikers. As we were looking for a spot to set up another couple came up from the pond and mentioned they could actually see the rain on the other side of the pond. Bagel and Mini Bites arrived as we were getting ready to set up our tent. They decided to tent here as well. We quickly set up, and decided to head down to the pond for a swim. Although it is called a pond, it is more like a lake and the water was amazing. So refreshing to enjoy a swim at the end of the day. Rumbles of thunder and flashes of lightning in the distance encouraged us to shorten our swim and get dried off and back up to camp for dinner. As we headed back Mini Bites came up from the dock where she had been swimming. She also commented that the thunder and lightning had ended her swim as well.
Just as we headed toward the shelter to cook dinner the rain started. We hustled back to our tent and made dinner in the vestibule. The rain shower didn't last long and as we were outside getting ready for bed the sky was a weird shade of yellow.  Mary was feeling pretty lousy and decided to take a Benadryl hoping that maybe she could get a good nights sleep.
When I was brushing my teeth I noticed that the pond was aglow in orange. I mentioned to Mary that I was going to go down to the pond with my camera, however, apparently the Benadryl at already knocked her out and she was fast asleep. The sky over the pond was stunning and I took several pictures before heading back up to the tent. I saw Crushes headlamp on in the shelter and mentioned to him that he may want to go down to see the sunset before he settled in for the night.
Off to bed, we are hoping to get up early so we can be at the Kennebec Ferry Crossing before 2:00 tomorrow when they make the final crossing for the day.","Safford Notch Campsite

We had set the alarm so that we could be on the trail early. Mary headed out to find the privy but came back stating she couldn't find it in the dark, even with her headlamp on. I went out to help her, and didn't have much luck either. We finally saw it in the distance and bushwacked our way to it, once there we found the trail so she would be able to make her way back more easily.
Quick cup of tea and breakfast and we were off. We were on trail at 5:45, and today was all about getting to the ferry crossing before 2:00, which was roughly 14 miles away. Mary set the pace and the trail was relatively flat with a series of bog bridges along the way. Every hour I checked our mileage and we seemed to be on track.
As we made it to the Pierce Pond Lean-to we dreamed about the 12 pancakes, sausage and scrambled eggs we might have had at Harrison's Pierce Pond Camps. Unfortunately for us the timing just didn't work out, perhaps we will come back at a future date. After Pierce Pond the footing got a little rockier and rootier and our pace slowed a little but we had built up enough cushion that we were still on track to make the ferry. We were surprised that Crush, Baygull, & Tiny Bytes (we have been spelling their trail names wrong...) hadn't gone by as we knew they were planning on making it to the ferry today as well.
We arrived at the ferry crossing just after 12:30, and Crush arrived shortly after. We had to take a short, flagged trail down to where the ferry was actually picking up. We signed the release forms, boarded the canoe, and we were off. As we were finishing up crossing we saw Baygull and Tiny Bytes arriving on the opposite shore. We decided to wait and get some photos of Crush as well as Baygull & Tiny Bytes as they made their crossing of the Kennebec. 
Once everyone was across the Kennebec we all made our way to the road where we could head to the Caratunk House. This is a Bed and Breakfast/Hiker hostel and we had heard tales of amazing milk shakes and pulled pork sandwiches. When we arrived we saw that Chaco, Calves, Franklinstein, Flyballs, Carpenter and several other hikers were already there. We quickly put in our order for a Coffee Milkshake for Mary, and Chocolate Milkshake for me, and 2 pulled pork sandwiches. We grabbed a bag of chips and looked at the resupply so that we would have an idea of what was available.
The ""old fashioned"" milkshakes came out in soda fountain glasses with the remainder that didn't fit in a red solo cup. They came with metal straws, and they tasted fabulous! The pulled pork sandwiches were excellent and we finished them quickly. We sat and chatted with everyone, and it certainly felt good to have 14 miles done and it was only 1:30. We rewarded ourselves by staying at the hostel to socialize for quite some time. Some hikers had decided to stay, but several like us were moving on, a few got a ride to a nearby pub for a beer.
Eventually we filled our water bottles, did our resupply, and with full, satisfied bellies we headed back to the trail. Baygull & Tiny Bytes headed out a little ahead of us and when we reached the parking lot at the trailhead they were at Half Slows Camper. Half Slow was making them a glass of chocolate milk, he offered to make us one and we decided to split a glass rather than him making more. Next thing you know he came out with a strawberry rhubarb pie, and we each enjoyed a couple spoonfuls even though we were already quite full from our lunch at the hostel. We joked with Baygull & Tiny Bytes that we were going to race ahead to get the best campsite at Pleasant Pond Lean-to.
We hiked with Baygull & Tiny Bytes for a bit before they took the lead for good. When we arrived at Pleasant Pond Lean-to the shelter was already quite full, and tent sites were limited. One of the hikers already there offered to give us the lay of the land. He mentioned that there were some possible sites to the left of the shelter. Baygull & Tiny Bytes were already set up, so we tried to find another area so as not to crowd them. However, we ended up setting up right next to their tent for the night as there were no other flat spots available.
We set up our tent, and even though it was starting to get chilly we headed down to the pond for a quick swim to clean up after a long day of hiking. The water was warm but the air temperature was cold, so we didn't linger once we got out. After drying off and getting our warmer clothes on we headed back to the pond to enjoy our dinner on the dock. We were hoping for another great sunset, but it ended up being just a little pretty pink sky.
Baygull & Tiny Bytes said they were going to get up early as they need to make it to Monson to pick up a package before noon on Saturday. They had lost track of what day of the week it was (as many hikers do), and thought they had an extra day.
Off to bed. Even though we have both been feeling lousy with colds, we have been enjoying taking the time to swim and socialize more and enjoy the beauty of Maine. In fact, when Mary mentioned that we had done 19 plus miles and we still had time to enjoy ourselves I said ""That's how thru-hiking is supposed to be"". 
We let Mary's sister April and her mom know that we hope to make it to Monson by Sunday. The plan is for them to pick us up there and we will head to their place for a night and to resupply.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

It was cold this morning, and we were the last ones out of camp. The day started with a climb right up Pleasant Pond Mountain. As we climbed we could hear a sea plane, however, we never did see it. Prior to reaching the summit Mary had to stop to take off her fleece as it was warming up quickly. I went ahead to the summit where I also removed my fleece. We took a short break on the summit where we  had some nice views.
Mary wasn't feeling well at all, so it was slow going. We made our way down Pleasant Pond Mountain and soon were on our way up Moxie Bald Mountain. At the beaver bog we were hoping to see a moose. Although we weren't lucky enough to see a moose, we saw a beautiful coyote. I hoped to get its picture, however he quickly moved on. When we reached the summit of Moxie Bald we stopped so Mary could stretch and I started looking to see if I could find some blueberries. Several comments on Guthooks mentioned that there were plenty of blueberries on the summit. Not long after I started my search I came upon the mother load of blueberries, big, ripe, and delicious blueberries. 
We started picking and eating blueberries as fast as we could. Then, I decided maybe we could pick some to enjoy with our breakfast in the morning. I grabbed a ziplock bag from my pack and started filling it with berries. Mary mostly ate blueberries, but she did add a few handfuls to the bag. The berries were so ripe they nearly fell of the bush as you went to pick them.
Mary sent out several texts as we had good service on the summit. Her sister April and mom mentioned that they could slack pack us from Shirley Blanchard Road to Route 15. We replied that we thought that would be great and we would text when we got closer to the road. Once we had our bag mostly full of berries, we decided it was time to move on.
We made our way to Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-to, and when we arrived Chaco, Calves, and Crush were already there. They had a nice fire going in the fire pit. We grabbed a site down close to the pond, rumor has it there is a moose that comes down to the pond every morning. We are hoping to catch a glimpse of the moose in the morning. We cooked on the picnic table, which is a rarity in Maine as we have seen very few tables. As we cooked and ate we chatted with Chaco, Calves & Crush as well as Popeye who we met for the first time here tonight.
Feels like it is going to be another cold one tonight, so we may be sleeping in our fleece and hats. Had to chase a brazen chipmunk away from our tent several times, hopefully he won't be a problem tonight. 
Off to bed.
We added our second video to our journal today. A view from Moxie Bald Mountain.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to

Another cold morning, fall is in the air. Chaco mentioned he was cold last night in his hammock, he and Calves were both sitting in the sun by the pond. I went to get water at the nearby stream and we sat at the picnic table and made our oatmeal, which we enjoyed with plenty of blueberries. In fact, there were more blueberries than oatmeal, which isn't a bad thing.
Sat by the pond enjoying our tea and watching dozens of frogs sunning themselves along the shore. Occasionally we would see one snap up a bug as the waves rocked them gently back and forth. 
We were the last ones out of camp, and just as we were leaving a southbound section hiker arrived. She had camped nearby and decided to come to the shelter to cook her breakfast. Most of the camp was heading to Monson today, we debated whether we should nero into Monson or try to make it today.
I know Mary isn't feeling well today because the terrain map looks mostly flat, but the many ups and downs had her dragging before lunch. As we walked along the West Branch of the Piscataquis River the trail would climb up a hundred feet or so and then head right back down to the river. We did this up and down multiple times, and at one point we decided to just stop at the river, soak our feet and have lunch.
One should never resupply on a full stomach. When we were in Caratunk enjoying milkshakes and pulled pork our options were rice cakes or whole wheat pitas. We thought, rice cakes might be ok to put my spam and Mary's almond butter and jam on. We were wrong! The rice cakes were thin, tasteless and dry, containing only 23 calories a piece. The bag contained around 16 rice cakes, and after making our initial ""sandwiches"", we choked down all but the one rice cake that fell on the ground and the 2 remaining in the bag that we couldn't choke down even with our hiker hunger. I think if I had pulled an old pizza box out of the trash it would have been tastier and more nutritious to make our sandwiches with.
 At some point we decided it would probably be better for us to make Monson today and take a zero. We are hoping a day off from hiking will help us finally shake our colds. We tried to get a text out to April and Mary's mom, however there was no service. So, we couldn't let them know that we would be in Monson today. We decided we better get going if we were going to make it to Monson before dark. We figured if we couldn't get a text out at some point along the trail, maybe we could once we reached Maine 15 where we would need to be picked up.
After fording the East Branch of the Piscataquis river we climbed up to the Shirley-Blanchard Road where we had originally talked about slackpacking. We decided to slackpack ourselves, so we gathered what we needed and then hung the extra pack and gear in a tree off trail. Shirley-Blanchard Road was very busy today with 4-wheeler traffic.
Shortly after we started hiking again Mary was able to get a call out to April to let her know our plan. She said she'd head right out, but we told her it would still probably be 3 hours before we would make it to Maine 15. We moved a little faster with our loads lightened, but with our colds we were still dragging as we climbed Buck Hill just prior to Monson. Earlier April had called back to find the location of our gear so she can hopefully pick that up so we won't be trying to locate it in the dark. We took our selfie for the day at the view of Lake Hebron on the east slope of Buck Hill.
We passed Franlinstein and Flyballs who had set up for the evening at a nice site near a small pond. When we arrived at Maine 15 April and Mary's mom were waiting. They had cold beer and food waiting for us when we arrived. And, they were able to locate our gear and pack hanging in the tree and had that with them as well.
I know Mary wasn't feeling well, because when we passed a homemade ice cream shop April offered to stop, but Mary declined. There is a first time for everything, and this is the first time Mary has passed up a homemade ice cream stop.
Once back at April's we showered and then enjoyed more food as there was a meal waiting for us. Off to bed in a real bed, hoping to get some sleep and shake our colds.","Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-to

Today was about resupply, relaxing, working on our journal and getting in a game of scrabble.
Our nephew Chase made a comment at one point that really gave us a good laugh. We were describing some of the food eaten by other hikers, and we mentioned how one hiker had a tortilla on which he spread peanut butter, added gummy bears and finally crunched a granola bar on top. Chase said ""That's tortilla abuse"".

April had us back on the trail a little before 9:00 am. Just as we arrived at the trailhead we saw Crush was there getting ready to head into the ""100 mile wilderness"". We chatted with Crush for a bit and then he headed down the trail, we followed not too long after.  We hadn't made it very far down the trail before Chaco and Calves went by us.
Hot and humid, and Mary was still lacking energy due to her cold. She actually had to stop at one point to take a quick nap. Another time she got a little over heated and ""woozly"" and had to take her pack off and have a snack. Thankfully our packs were not as heavy as they could be as Mary's mom (Beverly) and April will be resupplying us twice as we make our way through the wilderness. We passed several ponds on the way into Little Wilson Falls. We decided to have lunch at the top of the falls. As we were having lunch Shaggy and Maggie went by. After lunch we took a little time to soak our feet at the bottom of the falls.
We were moving slowly today, and miles were hard to come by. After we forded Big Wilson Stream we decided we were not going to be able to do as many miles as we hoped. Once we reached Wilson Valley Lean-to we decided to call it a day. Shaggy and Maggie struggled today also and were already at the shelter along with a couple of section hikers.
We found an acceptable spot up on the hill behind the shelter and set up our tent. We were warned that there was an aggressive chipmunk, and it was true. As soon as we began setting up the chipmunk was right there investigating what we had. We cooked dinner with the other hikers at the shelter before hanging our bear bag and retreating to our tent for the evening. Hopefully our energy will return tomorrow as we are on a schedule based on our first resupply at Katahdin Iron Works Road.","Maine 15

Not sure if it was the aggressive chipmunk, but something managed to climb down the bear bag rope and chew a hole in one of our food bags. The only food casualty was a package of peanut butter crackers.
Up and moving pretty early hoping to get in some good miles to make up for yesterday. Quick breakfast with a cup of hot tea and we were off. We leapfrogged with other hikers from the shelter as we made our way along the trail. 
The footing on the trail today wasn't great, but we did go by Slugundy Falls which has a nice swimming hole at the base. Too cool to swim this morning and we still had to get over Barren Slide, Barren Ledges, Barren Mountain and then the Chairbacks. We stopped at the remnants of the fire tower on Barren Mountain to have lunch and stretch. Mary caught a quick nap as she is still feeling the effects of her lingering cold. When we arrived there were two hikers already near the tower, one was thru-hiking, the other was her sister-in-law who was out to join her for the 100 mile wilderness. I think she may be regretting her decision as she seems to be suffering. Just as we were getting ready to leave a hiker who was at the shelter arrived. We chatted with her for a bit and found out she is an AMC guide currently working at one of the Maine AMC lodges.
We headed down into Fourth Mountain Alpine Bog where we walked along the bog bridges and got a chance to see the many rare pitcher plants that grow along the trail. I stopped to take several photos, and pointed out the plants to another hiker (can't remember her name). She saw me taking photos and thought I was using an app on my phone (plant snap) to identify the plants.
We hoped to make it to Chairback Gap Lean-to, however, after going over Fourth Mountain, Mount Three and a Half, and Third Mountain, Mary was ready to be done. Her lingering cold is really taking a toll, and she can't make the miles we had hoped to make. Near Monument Cliff on Third Mountain we passed the 2,100 mile mark, less than 100 miles to go! We stopped at a stream to get water and then made our way down to a stealth campsite at the base of Columbus Mountain. We found a nice, soft, flat, pine needle covered spot and set up our tent. We had dinner and hung our bear bag by headlamp.
As we lay in our tent planning tomorrow's hike, we heard voices. We never saw a headlamp, but someone must have been night hiking and listening to a podcast. We need to be up early tomorrow as we are meeting Mary's mom at Katahdin Ironworks Road at 9:00 am. We fell a couple miles short today, so that means an earlier start as we have an extra 2 miles to get done in the morning.","Wilson Valley Lean-to

Up early, and had a quick breakfast and a cup of hot tea. The day began with a climb up Columbus Mountain. Just past Chairback Gap Lean-to as we were going down the stone steps another thru-hiker passed us. He was in a hurry and was practically running down the steps.
We made our way up Chairback mountain, the climb up wasn't bad. The descent, however, was a different story as it was steep with a rock slide near the bottom. This short section of trail reminded us of Mahoosuc Notch. When we reached the bottom we were supposed to head to the left and climb up on a large boulder. We could see where other hikers had continued down as the trail was not clearly marked. At this point several paths meandered around, but none was the actual trail. I finally climbed back up retracing my steps and looking more carefully, and found the actual trail. About an hour later as we were coming down Chairback Ridge we met the hiker who passed us previously. He stopped and said ""Didn't I pass you earlier? Am I going the wrong way?"". We told him yes, he passed us earlier, and he was indeed now headed south instead of north. He quickly turned around and was off in the right direction again, sputtering expletives as he left. Apparently he had stopped to take care of some foot issues and got going the wrong way.
We had played our food close as we knew we would have two resupplies in the 100-mile wilderness. Mary was starting to lose energy and was getting a little ""Betty White-ish"". She was extremely happy to see her mom and her friend Pammy waiting at Katahdin Ironworks Road. Not only did they have our resupply, but they also brought leftover pizza, hardboiled eggs, snacks, ice tea and a coke for me. They also had a cooler of cold drinks they planned on leaving for trail magic. We ate, filled our water bottles and organized our resupply as we chatted. Another hike heading south came by and we offered him a hard boiled egg, some lemon cookies, and directed him to the cooler for a cold Pepsi. Before we said our good byes and thank yous, we grabbed a couple cold Pepsi's to pack out for later.
We soon forded the west branch of Pleasant River. Once you forded the river the trail became smooth and flat as it made its way through the hermitage. Upon reaching Gulf Hagas Stream we couldn't resist taking a quick dip in the pool formed by the small waterfall. On such a hot day we would have liked to stay here longer enjoying the cold, clear water.
For the next four miles the trail followed the stream. As it neared lunch time we found a flat rock beside the stream where we decided to have lunch. Since it was another hot day in Maine, we soaked our feet as we ate. When we reached Carl A Newhall Lean-to it was too early to stop, but we knew we wouldn't make Logan Brook Lean-to because we still had four significant mountains to climb. We knew there were a few possible campsites in the valley so we decided to push on and see how far we could make it.
After climbing Gulf Hagas Mountain Mary was getting tired, so when we reached Sidney Tappan Campsite we decided to stay rather than attempting the climb up West Peak. There was already a large school group at the campsite when we arrived, however we were able to find a site in the grassy area away from their campsite. It was fairly early, so we gathered water and enjoyed dinner at the log benches around the fire ring.
As we were finishing up our dinner another sandal clad thru-hiker came in looking for a site for him and 3 others who he said would be joining him shortly. We told him where the spring was located and also pointed out the campsites behind the school group. We told him (Evan - Ewolf) they were welcome to join us in the grassy area if they would like. Not long after, the remaining three in his group arrived - Yelp, who is from England, Handstand and Luke who are from Massachusetts. Luke is Handstand's boyfriend who joins her hiking on the AT for 2 weeks every month. When they asked us our trail names and we replied Earl Grey and Purple Haze they exclaimed that they had enjoyed the last of the cold drinks in the trail magic cooler that was marked ""from the family of Earl Grey and Purple Haze"". They were surprised to find trail magic in the 100-mile wilderness.
In bed early as tomorrow we will make our way up White Cap Mountain where, if the weather is good, we should get our first glimpse of Katahdin. White Cap will also be our last major climb until we summit.","Stealth Campsite .3 past trail to West Chairback Pond

Up fairly early despite the misty, foggy weather. We feared it would be noisy last night, however the large school group quieted down and we never heard a peep from them in the night. Had tea and breakfast in our tent due to the weather.
Mary started up the trail and I went to top off our water bottles as there are no water sources until we are up and over White Cap Mountain. Started up over West Peak and soon we had our rain jackets on as the mist soon became a wind blown rain. We were lamenting the fact that we couldn't make it over White Cap yesterday as we were hoping for good views, and with the rain it was not looking promising for any views at all. The trail was steep, but the footing was good and we were making decent time. Somewhere between West Peak and Hay Mountain we saw a pile of gear in the woods off the trail. As we got closer we realized it was a tent not set up (no poles) with someone in it. Just when we were thinking about checking it out we saw movement. Not sure if they slept in it last night with no poles, or were just getting out of the rain. It was a strange sight.
We reached the summit of White Cap and decided to take a break despite the rain. It was quite windy, and as we were having our snack and sharing one of the Pepsi's the clouds started to dissipate and we started to see some views down into the valley. We quickly made our way to the spur trail to see if we could catch a glimpse of Katahdin. Amazingly enough, the clouds parted and there in the distance was Katahdin! When we went back out to our packs, Yelp, Handstand, Luke and, Ewolf were just arriving at the summit. We mentioned to them that it had been really raining when we arrived, but in the brief 10 minutes we had been here we got a view of Katahdin. We all headed back to the spur trail to see if Katahdin was still in view. We all got pictures and video as Katahdin came in and out of view. 
While on the summit we received a text from April with weather updates. Our planned summit date of Tuesday is now looking like 90% rain, and Monday is looking like it will be a better day. Completely opposite of what we thought when we left Monson. We may need to revise our plans as we won't go up Katahdin in the rain.
We started the long descent, over 2,500 feet in about 4 miles. As we came around one corner we were startled by a Dalmatian sitting up on a large boulder. Upon further examination, we realized it was a statue (possibly wooden) that someone had placed there. Took a brief break at Logan Brook Lean-to for a stretch and a snack.
When we made it to Logan Brook Road we found a log beside the road to sit on and have lunch. Next to the log we found a large piece of birch bark that someone had scrawled ""Need ride for Cheeseburger"" on it in black sharpie. We wondered if that person ever got their burger. There was also a resupply bucket beside the road that we mistook for trail magic. The bucket was mostly empty except for a liner or something left behind.
Before making it to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to you have to get up and over Little Boardman Mountain. Another mountain Mary stated had a chip on its shoulder and was trying to keep up with the bigger mountains with its steepness. Once we got down off Little Boardman we couldn't resist taking a dip in Crawford Pond. When we arrived on the beach we found Yelp, Handstand, Luke, and Ewolf had the same idea. They had already been in swimming and were just getting ready to leave. The air was starting to cool down, but the swim felt really good.
Nice flat 3 miles to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to. When we arrived we encountered a large school group already set up in most of the tent sites. We made our way down to the shelter where several hikers were already set up and starting to cook dinner. Additional tent sites were limited, and we set up on the hill above the shelter in a spot that was too small and very rooty. Hopefully it won't rain, because I couldn't stake out my vestibule as there was a couple of Spruce trees that I have to climb through to get into the tent. We cooked dinner on a rock down near the shelter, where we met Ball Flap, another NOBO hiker who was chatting with some day hikers and a SOBO hiker. Yelp, Handstand, Luke and Ewolf are here tonight camped down below the shelter closer to the river. There is a beautiful swimming hole out in front of the shelter, but it is too cold now for another swim.
Tomorrow we meet Bev and April for our final resupply at Jo-Mary Road. We had hoped to go to White House Landing, but depending on the weather we may have to skip it so that we can make Katahdin before the rain.
Off to bed, hope we can get some sleep in our cramped, rooty, quarters.","Sidney Tappan Campsite

Quick breakfast and back to the trail. We are meeting April & Bev at Jo-Mary Road for our final resupply, and we are anticipating some possible goodies as well. Mary left first as I had to go down to the stream to retrieve our water scoop I must have left there last night. As I headed out I came upon the school group that left just before me stopped on the trail. As I went by they tucked in right behind me.
Trail was flat with good footing this morning and we made good time arriving at Jo-Mary Road early. Fortunately, April & Bev were already there waiting for us. They had our resupply as well as homemade oatmeal cookies (very yummy, thank you April!), homemade pizza (we raved about the pizza so much at the last resupply that April made a whole pizza to bring), cold drinks, and a variety of other snacks. Ball Flap, who camped just before Jo-Mary Road along with Bear Snack last night stopped to enjoy some trail magic. Apparently Bear Snack left early this morning, so he missed the trail magic. 
The school group soon arrived at the road to end their hike, and waited on the other side for their transportation. It is ironic that a school group can get picked up in the middle of the ""100-mile wilderness"". Not only that, but we saw two very large tour/coach buses go by. Yelp, Handstand, Luke, and Ewolf soon arrived and were able to enjoy trail magic with us. Handstand also made the announcement that she and Luke were going to get married on Katahdin, and asked if we could be a witness as they needed one more. We told them sure, we would love to as we planned to summit the same day. We did say we were not sure we could keep up with them and be on the summit at the same time as them.
As we chatted and enjoyed cookies, pizza and more we discussed that maybe we shouldn't go to White House Landing as that would leave us with 40 miles to do in two days to summit on Monday. We thanked April and Bev and headed down the trail still not sure what our destination would be. Shortly after we left we decided that we had already missed out on a pancake breakfast at Harrison's Pierce Pond, and skipped swimming in a few nice pools, so we made the decision that we would stay at White House Landing and attempt to make 40 miles the following two days.
It was a nice day, and when we passed a sandy beach on Lower Jo-Mary Lake Mary decided to enjoy a swim. I decided I would wait until White House Landing to swim. We were making really good time, and stopped to enjoy a dramatic view of Katahdin from the shore of Pemadumcook Lake. 
Soon we were at the dock for White House Landing. I put in a call and the owner said he would be right over in the boat to pick us up. It was amazing to suddenly be zooming along on the lake, and as we neared White House Landing we could see Yelp, Handstand, Luke & Ewolf on the shore waving to us. We got checked into our cabin, did our laundry outside in a wash tub, hung it to dry on a line, and then decided to go for a swim off the dock. It was starting to cool down, and when we got out we were certainly ready for a hot shower. We both grabbed showers and relaxed on the porch until it was time for dinner at 5:00.
We each ordered our burgers and took a seat at a table with Bear Snack and some section hikers. There was a salad of fresh cucumbers and tomatoes from their garden. Because we decided to stay, but have to make a lot of miles tomorrow, we will forego breakfast in the morning and the owner has agreed to take us back to the trail early in the morning. Normally the owner shuttles people back after breakfast, which would mean we wouldn't get back on trail until at least 8:30. We decided this was a good compromise, we could enjoy ourselves here and still get back to the trail early. 
There was another couple staying here to celebrate their anniversary, and they had brought fireworks to shoot off as soon as it was dark. So, we got to sit on the porch of our cabin and enjoy a fireworks display before heading to bed. Glad to be inside tonight as it is very cold. Clear and cold, and the stars are beautiful.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

We awoke in the dark to get packed up because we had to be ready to get shuttled at 6:15. We had a cup of tea and split the loaf of homemade zucchini bread we bought at dinner last night since we knew we wouldn't be staying for breakfast. We were packed and ready and waiting when the owner arrived. We settled our bill and headed out across the lake back to the trail. Very cold this morning, we had our hats, puffy coats and rain jackets on to block the wind for the ride over. As he shuttled us back to the trail the owner commented that this would be our ""easiest mile all day"".
Today was do or die day for us if we plan to summit on Monday. We have to make at least 20 miles today to give us a chance to make it to the Birches Sunday night. We are happy, but jealous, this is at least the second consecutive day of beautiful weather and we know of a several hikers that plan to summit today, and it should be a perfect day to summit Katahdin. We had actually talked a couple times about skipping ahead on one of the good days to summit and then hiking south to where we got off trail. But, when we touch that sign on Katahdin we want to know that we have passed every white blaze and are done with our thru-hike.
Cold and windy when we stopped for a break at Nahmakanta Lake Campsites for a quick stretch and snack. We enjoyed the oranges that April & Bev had brought yesterday. As soon as we stopped, we had to put our hats and fleece back on, and as we continued around the lake we could see white caps.
We made our final climb of the 100-mile wilderness up Nesuntabunt Mountain where a short side trail leads to a dramatic view of Katahdin. At this point Katahdin is only 16 miles away, but still 35 plus trail miles. We were craving more pizza, and couldn't remember if we had packed out 4 pieces or 2. We had eaten some pizza yesterday, but when we checked our pack we were excited to find 2 more slices. The zucchini bread we had this morning was really moist and yummy, but by this time we were starved again. After viewing Katahdin, we sat by the trail eating pizza as a father and son who are section hiking from Katahdin to Monson came up the trail. The trail has certainly been busy today, lots of north bounders racing to the end, flip floppers heading south, and day hikers out enjoying the nice weather.
Met Yelp, Handstand, and Luke just prior to arriving at Rainbow Stream Lean-to. They said they were going to spend the night there, which will leave them 21 miles for tomorrow. We told them we were going to hike on as we are going to make as many miles today as we can as we don't want a big day right prior to summitting. Ewolf arrived as I was at the spring getting water.
We made it nearly four more miles to the north end of Rainbow Lake where we found an acceptable spot to set up our tent. It was nearly dark when we arrived so once again we ended up setting up camp, cooking, eating and hanging the bear bag by headlamp. It was long day, and we were both pretty tired when we climbed into our sleeping bags. But, we are confident we can make the 17 miles to the Birches tomorrow. Looks like it is going to be another cold night, hopefully the wind coming across the lake will calm down.","Whitehouse Landing

The wind died down last night, but it was certainly cold last night and this morning. Oatmeal and hot tea in the tent before picking up and getting ready for the day.
As we headed down the trail we saw someone was camped just a short ways up the trail from us. Our plan was to make it to Abol Bridge Campground for lunch and a final small resupply for tonight and tomorrow. Then we would make our way through Baxter and into the Birches to make our final preparations for Katahdin tomorrow.
We crossed Rainbow Ledges first thing this morning and had another view of Katahdin. This would be another wonderful day to summit as it is a clear cool morning. Hopefully the weather will hold for us tomorrow.
As we hiked along we could hear banging and clanging in the distance. As we approached Hurd Brook Lean-to, we realized they were building a new privy. We knew we were getting close now as this is the last shelter in the 100-mile wilderness. It wasn't long and we were at Abol Bridge and were afforded a stunning view of Katahdin against a brilliant blue sky. We lingered on the bridge for a while just enjoying the view and thinking about how far we had come and how soon our journey would be over.
Our hopes for lunch at the restaurant at Abol Bridge were dashed when we were told it didn't open until 11:00. It was only 10:00 when we arrived, and we were afraid the Birches may fill up so we decided we better just do our resupply and head into Baxter. We had some snacks to eat, grabbed a mashed potato for dinner tonight, and some pumpkin whoopie pies for breakfast. We would have liked to get more food, but the prices were quite high here, so we just grabbed the ""essentials"".
As we entered the park we encountered a Baxter Ranger who inquired what our plans were. We told him we were planning to summit tomorrow and we were hoping to camp at the Birches tonight. He told us we should be all set, and called ahead to let the ranger at Katahdin Streams Campground know that Earl Grey & Purple Haze were heading that way. He was very helpful and answered some more of our questions regarding our stay in the park.
We made our way to the kiosk and signed in, there were only two others signed up so far for the Birches. So, we relaxed and were able to leisurely hike the remaining 9 miles. We managed to get cell phone service soon after and got a message out to family that we had made it to Baxter and we were all set to summit tomorrow.
Pine Point seemed like the perfect spot for a lunch break, and we sat out on the rocks in Nesowadnehunk Stream as we ate. The trail follows the stream and we had to ford a branch of the stream a couple different times. After the second ford we stopped to soak our feet before making our way to Big Niagara Falls. There were quite a few day hikers at the falls and on the trail today fishing and enjoying the nice weather. We also met a couple of flip floppers who had summited yesterday and commented that it was like Disneyland on the summit with more than 30 hikers milling about.
A couple more views of Katahdin and then we made our way past Daicey and Grassy Pond. Before we knew it, we were walking into Katahdin Stream Campground. We saw Carpenter, Ball Flap, and a couple other hikers waiting for a shuttle. They had summited today, and told us we had just missed Calves and Chaco who also summited today.
The ranger wasn't in, so we grabbed some water at the stream and made our way to the Birches to set up camp. When we arrived there were only two other hikers there. I forget their names, but one had already thru-hiked the AT once and was now doing it again in sections with his friend. Going to be another cold night, we chatted for some time over dinner with the other two gentlemen about our journey coming to an end tomorrow before we finally decided we better head to our tent as we plan on getting up and going early tomorrow.
It is dark now, and we are the only four hikers here at the birches. Hopefully the rain will hold off and we will have a clear day to enjoy our day on Katahdin.","Stealth Campsite at North End of Rainbow Lake

Not sure how cold it got last night, but it was cold! Good thing this is our last day, otherwise we would have to send for our warmer gear. The alarm went off around 4:15, but we were moving slow do to the cold. Had our breakfast of pumpkin whoopie pies and hot tea in the tent after searching in the dark for the bear bags.
Packed our gear for the final time, only putting what we needed into my pack for the way up. The rest we put in Mary's pack and our pack liner bags and stowed these at the ranger station. 
We were on trail a little before 6:00, most of the campground was still fast asleep as we made our way by. We were the first to sign the trailhead log. We quickly made our way to Katahdin Stream Falls, but we were too excited to linger long. We figured we would have time to enjoy the falls on the way down.
The sky was starting to brighten, and we could see it was relatively cloud free. We were hoping by the time we made the summit the skies would still be clear. Mary was optimistic that she could easily make the summit as the trail was quite forgiving as we made our way toward tree line. Once we hit tree line, Mary's optimism was tempered some by the rocks and metal handholds. By the time we neared the tablelands, there were foul words, maybe a few tears, and the proclamation that she would not be coming down the same trail. (Mary here, this part of the trail was much more difficult than I had anticipated. I knew it would be difficult, but I figured making it through New Hampshire and Southern Maine would have prepared me for the challenge. I said I wouldn't swear, or get frustrated, but that didn't last...)
We stopped at the hunt spur for a snack and a break. As we rested, a few hikers passed as they made their way up the rocks. The views were incredible as we looked to the valley below. As we continued on more and more hikers were streaming toward the summit, all were in good spirits as the weather was cooperating and it was just a fantastic day to complete the journey.
Once we reached the tablelands the trail eased and became a beautiful walk above tree line, the views were just amazing. We could see Yelp making his way up, and further back it looked like Handstand, Luke and Ewolf. 
As we looked up on the ridge, we could see the famous sign in the distance. We were closing in fast now, and our emotions were rising as we neared the sign. Several hikers, including Yelp, were cheering us and congratulating us as we reached the summit. It was hard to believe that the adventure we started six months ago was coming to an end. We reached the sign together, and the emotions were overwhelming, so we took several moments to gather ourselves before getting our summit photos on the iconic sign. As were taking time to gather ourselves, Handstand, Luke & Ewolf arrived. 
We took our turn having our photos taken, and Handstand asked if we had time to stay for the wedding ceremony. We of course said yes, we would be honored to. It was a beautiful ceremony, and a hush came over the mountain as they said their vows. What a backdrop for a wedding, simply breathtaking! When they finished, everyone cheered. Mary witnessed their marriage license, we got a few photos at the sign with the wedding party, we rested and watched several other hikers finish and get their photos. The mood was quite joyous as one by one hikers finished, realizing they had accomplished their dream of completing the Appalachian Trail.
After an hour or so we decided we better start making our way down. Mary made the decision that we would take the Saddle Trail to Chimney Pond Trail and finish at Roaring Brook Campground. She was actually able to get a call out to April to let her know where to pick us up, and we started the trek down the mountain. The Saddle Trail was certainly easier as far as there was no hand over hand climbing. However, once you reached the slide, you were doing just that. Climbing down loose dirt and rock, which slowed our descent quite a bit. The slide went on for what seemed like forever, but eventually it just became a normal New England trail with the usual rocks and roots.
As we neared Roaring Brooks, we saw April waiting for us. She had hiked a short distance in to wait for our arrival. We were so happy to see her, and soon we reached the entrance to the campground where Bev was waiting. While they had been waiting for us, they had managed to grab our gear we had stowed at the ranger station. We made our way back to the parking lot where their car was waiting complete with snacks and cold beverages. Even though they already had our gear we decided we wanted to go back to the ranger station as we had neglected to sign the hiker log book there. We also wanted to see which of our hiking friends had already summited, and if any others had arrived today while we were on the mountain. 
When we finished in Baxter we headed to Millinocket, hoping to sign the ceiling tile at the AT Café and get something to eat. Unfortunately, the AT Café had closed at 2:00, and we searched for other restaurants in the area, but they were either out of business or closed for the day. So April and Bev suggested a diner in Medway, Maine and we headed that way. The restaurant was very busy, and we had a short wait but were soon seated. We ordered our dinners, and the waitress put in our order, stating that she ""needed two orders of breadsticks now!"" April had mentioned we had just finished hiking the Appalachian Trail, and Mary let her know she was hungry. The food came and was delicious, the portions were large, but we still had room for pie, which was amazing.
After an exhausting day we arrived at April's and didn't do much more than get hot showers and climb into a soft, comfortable bed. We left instructions that we would not be getting up early in the morning, no need to wake us.
Thank you to April and mom for making our final day on the trail a less stressful one. We were lucky not to have to worry about getting a hitch or a shuttle out of Baxter or worry about how we would get back home to New Hampshire.
We will each do a final post in the coming days to reflect on our individual thoughts on this amazing adventure.","The Birches Lean-to & Campsite

Earl Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606223,"Well, it has been about four months since we finished the trail, and I thought maybe it is time to work on my final entry. I think I've avoided putting in a final entry because it means that the adventure is over. But, although the adventure is over we can start thinking about what our next adventure may be.
When Alan hiked in 2011 I entered his journal for him and ""followed"" his adventure by reading and entering his journal entries and also reading other hiker journals and blogs that I would find when searching the names of hikers he would mention. It was never my dream or plan to hike the Appalachian Trail, but after following along on his and other hikers' adventures, I started to think that maybe I would like to someday hike the trail.
The original plan was to hike in 2016, however, I had been dealing with bursitis in both my hips for a couple years and we had also decided to build a new home. By 2018, after much physical therapy and finally Platelet Rich Plasma injections in both hips, I felt that I might be ready to attempt a thru hike. Our new home wasn't finished, but it was completed enough that we felt we could start our hike in March.
The hike was a lot more difficult than I had anticipated, but also very rewarding. Once we reached the ""halfway point"" at Harper's Ferry, I began to think that I could actually make it to Katahdin. And then, once we reached Vermont I felt like we were on the homestretch, and I was ready to be finished. Although we had hiked all the 4,000 footers in New Hampshire, as well as hiking many other trails in New Hampshire, the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire was a major challenge for me, as was the trail in southern Maine. There were many times along the trail where I questioned if I had ""any business being on the trail"". Thankfully, Alan was patient, and talked me through the difficult ""ups and downs"" of the trail. There were even times where we walked hand in hand along rocky sections that made me nervous, and times when he took my pack so that I could make my way up or down a difficult section of trail. I couldn't have done it without him, but more importantly I wouldn't have wanted to hike the trail without him. We had several people ask us if it was difficult spending so much time together every day for so many months. For me, and I know for Alan as well, we enjoyed our time together.
As much as I was ready for the hike to be over as we neared the end, now I truly miss the trail. I miss the simplicity of the hike. I'm not saying it was easy, I'm saying there is a calming simplicity that comes with being out in nature everyday with just one task, which is hiking. You have everything you need in a pack on your back. There is no decision on what you will wear for the day, you don't have to deal with the paperwork that constantly needs attention at home, and you know that all you need to do is get up, eat, and start putting one foot in front of the other until you decide to stop for the day and set up your tent, do a few chores and head to bed. Each day brings something new whether it be the hikers that you meet, the views that you see, the challenges you endure of just the beauty you find along the trail.
I didn't think
it would be difficult getting back to life as it was before the hike, but that
is a new challenge. The simplicity of the trail is gone, and now you are back
dealing with the hustle and bustle of everyday life. After having just a pack
with everything you need on your back for 6 months you come home to a house
filled with too much “stuff”.  It is
difficult to explain, and I’m probably not doing a good job of it. If you read
other hikers final entries they may say it better. For example, Gbolt’s trail
journal entry after he completed the trail tells about trying to adjust to life
after the trail.
Since finishing
the hike I have said that I don’t think another thru-hike is in my future. Not
because I wouldn’t enjoy it, but because being away from family for that long
is difficult. So, as far as future hiking adventures go, for me, it will be
section hikes. Although, never say never…",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Fri",0
