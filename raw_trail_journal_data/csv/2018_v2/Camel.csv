Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589087,"Whew! I'm heading to Stehekin after all. I thought I would only have enough time to try to finish the AT from Hot Springs to Katahdin, but my post-trail plans have changed. I'm going to have to get into an EMS career through an actual community college program, or else I'll have problems getting licensed in any of the states I'd like to live in, including my once and current home state of Wisconsin. Not to mention that there'll be job placement, which will remove most of the stress I've been feeling about the change. Now I just have to decide between WI and TN, but that's probably material for a different kind of journal.

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590641,"I just returned from the post office in my small Wisconsin town, where the person behind the counter informed me that they could have accidentally returned my driver license. I'm supposed to be getting on a plane to San Diego on Tuesday, the 22nd, to start the trail on the 23rd. There is no telling now whether or not I'll be delayed, and how many hundreds of dollars I'll lose if I don't get the license. I have a motel reservation in El Cajon and reservations at Lake Morena and Burnt Rancheria. Not to mention that I upgraded to Economy Plus for the 4 hour leg of my flight.Last week I was vacillating between returning to Tennessee after my hike, or becoming a Wisconsin resident. At the last minute, I decided to stay in Wisconsin. So, I cancelled a mail forward that was supposed to go into effect on Saturday, and went to the DMV and got my license. As my usual anti-luck would have it, the license was supposed to be delivered on Saturday. The clerk told me that they got the cancellation, and I have an email receipt saying that I'd successfully cancelled it on the 8th, yet it could have been returned by accident. (The DMV's envelopes are marked Return Service Requested and aren't supposed to be forwarded.)I guess we'll see what happens. The DMV told me that they can't do anything until my temporary driving receipt expires, on the 22nd, so I expect to be delayed by a week and lose a lot of money. I would be much more distraught if I didn't have a daily meditation practice. Still, this sucks. I'm going to drink another cup of coffee, meditate for an hour, and go do my training run / walk. And maybe look into delaying my flight...",,Nowhere,"May 16, Wed",0
Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592103,"I have two full days before my start on May 30th. My driver's license arrived as soon as I had paid to change my ticket. For the past three months I've been challenged and delayed by high blood pressure, family matters, car trouble, indecision, and even a newfound dedication to meditation. The hike itself will be relatively chill.
I'm not going to divulge what kind of shape I'm in, but it's nothing close to when I was living in the Smokies. Still, I managed a 20 mile run/walk yesterday in some unseasonable 90° weather, so this hike is sounding completely plausible.
I'm planning on going fast and light through the desert and mailing my heavy rig to Kennedy Meadows. I'll finish packing tomorrow and post a final pack weight then, but my base should be below 10 lbs for this first section, if I can help it.",,Nowhere,"May 27, Sun",0
Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592339,"I've been delayed again, due to July deadlines at the EMT program I'm going to be attending next spring. An already late start, and the prospect of having to leave the tail to take care of immunizations and take a BLS course, has made me decide to just hike SOBO instead. Will I ever make it to the trail? I still think so, but I understand that you may be doubtful.This resets my time window, and gives me an extra month to get in shape, which is nice. But I will be starting with a heavier pack.",,View Entry,"May 30, Wed",0
Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596335,"Well, I'm not hiking the PCT. I'm hiking the AT, and I actually made it to a trailhead this time.Today a few hikers and I rode from the Appalachian Trail Lodge hostel in Millinocket, to Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park, to start our Southbound hikes. The driver, ""Ole Man"" said the hike would take 8-10 hours, so I figured 6 at most. I was wrong, it took me almost 9 to ascend the Hunt Trail and descend the Abol Trail. It doesn't help that I'm fat, out of shape, and haven't had trail legs in two years.
I used to think that some of the trails in the Smokies were badass (Rainbow Falls and Low Gap come to mind) but this one involved scrambling up some boulders to a place I called the ""Hillary Step"" and then some more minor scrambling up to the ""Tablelands"" (actual name this time), from where it was a flat, rocky mile to the true summit. In total there were 4019 feet of gain in 9.47 miles, KSC to Baxter Peak to Abol Campground.
I decided to take the Abol Trail down, basically for safety, since I'm good at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It's a steep, rocky, rooty mess but the smell of death is fainter. From Abol Campground to KSC is about a mile on the park road, but I got a ride from a nice ranger.
Regardless of Katahdin, this park is one of the most beautiful places I've seen. The campground was pretty and well-maintained, and stocked with toilet paper. There are sites with wooden shelters they call ""lean-tos"", if you don't mind laying out a buffet table for blackflies and mosquitoes.
I shared a campsite with another SOBO from the hostel. We turned in very early.","Katahdin Stream Campground
",Katahdin,"Jul 04, Wed",5.40
Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596397,"I woke up at around 4:30 to the annoying sounds of birds, but happy to be a little cool for a change. My legs were starting to get sore, but not as sore as they would be tomorrow. I packed up quickly, ate a couple of Clif Bars, and started for Abol Bridge and the park boundary. I wished my sitemate well on his hike and told him I saw white blazes up on the road behind us (Tower Road). With consumables, my ""slack"" pack weighed about 16 pounds.
It was very buggy, but my natural bugspray (the Repel Eucalyptus) worked pretty well. I got to see the ponds in the early morning golden hour. Since I had plenty of time to hike the short distance before my pick up at 2, I took the short side trail to Little Niagara Falls. When I got out onto the boulder, there were no bugs. None at all. I sat there for about half an hour enjoying the view. (It's the picture you see.)
The trail had started out gnarly, but thankfully smoothed out as the trail began to follow the river. The mosquitoes started to thin out around 9, but were replaced by deer flies and heat. It got up to 97 degrees in Millinocket, but I'm sure the woods were slightly cooler. Still, my water consumption went up and the hike became a bit of a chore as I got jaded on the scenery.
Near Abol bridge I ran into a ranger who told me where to deposit the yellow sheet. I forgot that it came with the red permit card, slightly displeasing the ranger. Next he called it a slip, so I finally remembered. The slip is safely in the drop box.
There was a majestic view of Katahdin from Abol Bridge, followed by a short, hot road walk between the trailhead and the store. I was glad I payed 50 grams to haul my Outdoor Research sun hat.
At the store, I drank a cold Coke and orange juice and made a call via satellite phone to the AT Lodge. Fortunately they were able to pick me up early and I didn't have to wait around in the heat until 2.
The driver was great (Sprinkles' husband, I forgot his name though) and we talked the whole way back on the rough road. It was nice to have air conditioning in the car. Civilization is great when you're tired and out of shape.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596402,"Yesterday, Ole Man and the shuttle driver called me a Gram Nazi when I playfully complained about the weight of sunscreen. I may be a little broiled but yesterday's trial pack in my new Osprey Exos 58 was under 7,000 grams. Yes, I brought a 95g American Weigh SR-20 luggage scale. It shares AAA batteries with my headlamp though. That makes it alright.
It's raining and the weather is thankfully going to cool off into the 70s. It'll be back up to 92 on Monday the 9th, though. Today I have to shop for food, do laundry, mail my temporary pack home, fill my drop bucket, and pack for the Hundred Mile Wilderness. Basically, more chores than I've ever done in a single day.
Since I wanted to enter the HMW with some antioxidants in my system, I schlepped it over to the Hannaford supermarket. If your resupply is simple, or you don't care about fresh produce, my advice would be to try Rideout's first. They're maybe 1/4 mile up Poplar Street and there's even a sidewalk the whole way. (Which reminds me, I still need toilet paper--and extra bug spray.)
On the way, I stopped at the Dollar General and managed to cut the weight of my camp shoes in half, for $1.06, less than a penny per gram. REI isn't nearly as efficient! OTOH, that actually raises my pack weight by 160g.
I also made a plan to stash a can of beans and a can of spinach in my drop bucket. I can eat those at the drop point and the hostel will take it back with my garbage. I also stashed most of my pound of matcha [sic!] and my running tights. I mean long baselayer. And my albatross of an Ursack.
My food has a low calorie density so the bucket is completely full. I'm taking 10,700 calories in with me, and stashing the remaining 7,300. Since the bulk of the calories come from oatmeal, raisins, and other tasteless vegan foods, 3k Calories a day would take a serious commitment to eating. I doubt that will happen until I've lost a little weight, so I figure I have 6-9 days of food.
I spent most of my free time this afternoon trading notes with a younger guy who's starting at Katahdin tomorrow. I told him how terrible it would be and that he'll never make it with that heavy pack of his. He probably will, though.
Total pack weight going into the HMW: 10,500 grams. Give or take, without toilet paper.
I've been hobbling around town with DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness) today, so I'm glad it's flat tomorrow, except for a climb to a viewpoint at Rainbow Ledges. The steepest part is 950 feet per mile... but only for 0.2 miles.","Millinocket

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597353,"Well, that was humbling. I've just hiked some of the most gratuitously rocky and rooty trail ever created, through the buggiest wild lands in the East. But that's the cliche, and as such it's partly true. There were also beautiful pond scenes, hard-won summits, and even some surprisingly easy trail tread that I was very grateful for.
This was my itinerary:
07-07 004 30.1 Rainbow Stream Leanto

07-16 013 117.8 (6.3) Nearo to Monson
It's too onerous to type html on my phone, especially on my wilderness adventure.
That's an average of 10.3 miles a day, exactly what Ole Man predicted. (11.4 on trail, not counting the zero.)
I'm not sure if it's the heat, elevation, or season, but bugs weren't really a problem either. Based on reports, the thought of being sucked down to a raisin by a cloud of mosquitoes was always in the back of my mind. Especially since I didn't bring enough spray. And the ""Made In Maine"" natural spray I bought at Ride Out's didn't work as well as Repel. The best way I found to stay sane when followed by deer flies is to try to kill them, patiently using myself as bait. It's so satisfying, you'll soon be questioning it as a technique for staying sane.
I also didn't pack in enough food or leave enough in my drop bucket. That realization was responsible for my decision to stay at Whitehouse Landing. It's a great place, regardless. My advice would be to save up the money to be able to take a zero there. You can't beat the experience of getting picked up in a boat after calling your hosts on a radio. The site is off the grid, but has the latest in 19th century technology: multi-stall outhouses, gaslight, and even a tub and washboard so you can do your laundry. The food is great and they pack your leftover pizza for the next morning's hike. The resupply is mostly snacks and bars--no bug spray.
As Shaw's internet allows, I'll upload a dozen of the many pictures I took. I hope they give you some idea of what it was like. Many of my photos are of the trail itself--I thought that maybe, in a few years time, when the memories start to fade, I might want to remind myself what the actual trail was like, too--not just the scenery. The hike and the effort.
And last but not least, I still have not seen a moose. A hiker named Nome de Jour has seen two. Maybe you have to get up early in the morning or something.","Golden Road

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597676,"Shaw's was a great stay and a great place to zero. There were plenty of NOBOs around to give whatever advice was asked, and a great atmosphere. Among those I remember, I hung out with Bearscare, Traveller, and Stringbean, who for some reason doesn't like his trail name. There's no need to accept it, and plenty of time to get a new one.
After a semi-vegan breakfast, Poet drove me out the 1.7 miles to the trailhead at Pleasant St. Like he said on the ride out, he and Hippy Chick are living their dream.
With the trail forecast to be easy until Bigelow Preserve, I decided to try to push to Caratunk in two days. This meant getting over Moxie Bald on the first day to spare myself two climbs the next.
Despite warnings about following the cairns, I spent a bit longer on the bald than I intended, and finally consulted the Guthook app. It just turned out that I needed to follow the cairns, but the pile on the summit that holds up the MATC sign isn't a cairn.
The trail is easy. Big steps are still hard but my complaints now are with feet, not legs. My trail legs are developing nicely. I must have some cartilage left from the Smokies.
Over the course of the day, following upon conversations I'd had with people at Shaw's, I mulled over my reasons for hiking the trail and possible reasons for getting off. At this point, I think that if I were to leave the trail, it would be for the right reasons--it may be someone's dream, but it's not really mine. The work I've done or need to do doesn't require me to literalize an internal journey into an external one. I'm not expecting any profound insights, just a great adventure. I thought about the comforts of car camping. Not to worry, though, at this point I'm all-in until Springer. Like I write in the registers, ""Zen is just walking.""
While mulling too hard, and Zenning too little, I slipped on a wet rock and fell. I had to stop and Neosporin a thumbnail that bent backwards and scraped a bunch of tetanus and liver fluke eggs off of the next rock and right into my bloodstream. Infection or injury would be a terrible reason to stop. That was my third fall on the trail.
When I got to the campsite I was all business: tent, eat, sleep. I tossed and turned most of the night and ended up putting on all of my clothes to stay warm. That's part of the joy of ultralight hiking, except the non-clothing items in my pack weigh too much to qualify. I packed out 24.7 pounds total, 18.3 without food but with other consumables. (It turned out to be way too much food.) I gained 37 grams by replacing those flimsy dollar-store flipflops with a new pair of Crocs. The rest of the weight must be accumulated dirt and duff, plus ""necessities"".","Pleasant Street Trailhead (Mile 117.8)

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597699,"Getting moving today was a chore. Despite the easy trail, and cushy Altra Olympus 2.5's, a tenderfoot like me can feel 19 miles.
I slowly broke camp and left at around 9. The hike was easy but not particularly scenic, and I didn't take any photos worth sharing.
At some point I caught up with Road Runner, who had teleported himself ahead of my location, probably while I was still sleeping. He got to The Sterling Inn a couple of hours after me, but told me he spent a couple of hours hanging out at a pond and taking his time. He's a fast hiker.
At this point I was unclear whether or not I would zero so soon, but my feet, and residual hunger from undereating the last 2 days, decided that for me.
So far, my trip statistics are as follows, with OTA meaning ""On-Trail Average"", i.e. miles per day discounting zeros.
Days: 16
Zeros: 3 (18.8% of days)
MPD: 9.5
OTA: 11.6
ETA: 215 days
By my reckoning, it won't be clear that I'll make it in a reasonable time until I'm somewhere in Vermont. The Presidentials are going to be 10 mile days.","Bald Mtn Brook Lean-to
","Maine Hwy 201, Caratunk","Jul 19, Thu",14.70
Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597705,"Yesterday I took the road walk from the trailhead, through the hamlet of Caratunk, to the Sterling Inn. On the way over I saw Bearscare resupplying at the Caratunk B&B before moving on to Stratton. I chose not to stay there because I thought the store at the Sterling might be better. The walk is easy because it allows you to avoid most of that stretch of Highway 201.
I'm very happy with my choice. The Sterling is clean and well run by a father-son team, Eric and Zach. The rooms and bunks are nice, reasonably priced, and the common areas are fantastic. There's a non-vegan couch and a huge DVD selection. I briefly considered deodorant.
Eric told me that the Inn used to be a stopover on a stagecoach line that ran between Bingham and The Forks. What now takes an hour used to take 3 days, and the place had to be self-sufficient because of the lack of supplies.
All I've been doing today is eating. I have to recommend those Good To Go meals since I've eaten six during my stay. The Smoked Three Bean Chili and the Quinoa Whatever are vegan and have 18 and 13 grams of protein, respectively.
The store here is small but well thought out. For me, there are beans, Clif Bars, and dried fruit, but there are things for meat eaters too. Unfortunately there's no frozen veg*n food apart from a cheese pizza, so later I'm going to go to a restaurant. I'm short of true ""hiker hunger"" but there's hunger, and there's a place in town with veggie burgers and stir-fried Brussels sprouts. I'm going to get two of those.
The store also has gas canisters (in two sizes, along with their tiny stoves), Frogg Toggs and other gear, and first aid / personal care items.
My laundry is done but as for myself, it's pointless to scrub too hard--I'm leaving tomorrow and walking into a wall of rain starting Sunday.
----------
After taking a full bath in the antique tub--and scrubbing my feet--I ran into NOBO LASHer Trail Dog and invited him to come out with me to The Boatman restaurant at Three Rivers (where the Brussels sprouts are). Trail Dog is retired and is about to finish his last section. Not only did I enjoy the sprouts (just one--they're ten bucks), a gigantic salad, and a veggie burger, but also an excellent conversation, for which I'm very grateful. I hope Trail Dog enjoys the Wilderness and Katahdin and everything goes well on his last section hike.
Now it's time to pack and get some sleep before crossing the Kennebec.","The Sterling Inn

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598223,"I left Caratunk shortly after 9 in the morning, when the Kennebec ferry would be running. I don't see why anyone would want to ford, the water isn't shallow even when the dam is closed.
It was easy hiking to West Carry Pond lean-to. On my way back from a blue blaze to a waterfall, I ran into Babe, whom I had met on the dock waiting for the White House Landing boat. I think she's continually amazed I continue to manage hauling myself down the trail.
At WCP, no less than two people showed up to give trail magic. A gentleman whose wife worked at Lindor donated a big bag of Lindor Truffles. An older landowner from across the pond came to deliver PB&J sandwiches, some kind of other local sandwich desert with 1000 calories, fresh apples, and bubble gum. He talked to us about it for a while. Very nice guys.
After they left, I met Jaybird, who's from Chicago. He encouraged me to stick to the original 19.1 mile plan I had for the first night. I thought it might be better to get moving after sleeping at a shelter, and enjoying our last night of good weather, but then we would have surely had to go over Bigelow in rain and possibly lightning. Jaybird was sure the rain wasn't starting until the afternoon. We could summit by 2PM.
We hiked on to the tent sites at East Flagstaff Lake and camped at dusk, awkwardly among some NOBO tents. By this time I was too tired to be hungry so I went to sleep.
The next morning, the rain was still an abstraction. In fact, we didn't run into any problems until the afternoon, though we could see it building. The ascent was harder than we thought. We crossed Bigelow, above treeline, in the blowing rain, at a snail's pace that I was happy to maintain.
At the end of a 13.5 mile day that started at 5:30AM, we were happy as hell to see the Horns Pond leant-os, at around 4PM, and ended up overnighting in the day-use lean-to. Jaybird treated me to some hot water, which I used to make tea.
After our ordeal, we decided it was wise to go into Stratton. After much discussion, Babe decided on Hostel of Maine, with its concentration-camp like atmosphere and nonvegan seating, while Jaybird and I slummed it at the Stratton Motel and Hostel, where I'm writing this now. There's easy access to the produce I've been lusting after, and good company at the motel. Bearscare is here and I've met Danish and Catch Up. Catch Up is SOBO but is really on top of her game, one of the most efficient hikers I've ever seen. She made her own camp slippers from inserts, duct tape, and foam.
I've decided I'm going to have some critical gear shipped here: a pair of Salamon XA Pro 3Ds, a bag liner, a stove, and some tea. Those are all going to be handy in the Whites. I'm going to gain 2 pounds.","Maine Hwy 201, Caratunk

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598251,"Today, after UPS came and I had put on my Salamons to break in, I bought a gas canister and cooked up some pu'erh tea from thousand-year old tea trees. The tea was earthy of course but quite mellow for pu'erh, at least to my taste. I got some Darjeeling, too. Eight ounces of each. I treated Trout, who runs the hostel, and a woman from Australia named Ziploc. Catch Up and I had talked about tea a lot, too bad she, Danish, and Bearscare  all left this morning.
Last night, Trout (who managed the hostel), Danish, and I went out to the Stratton Plaza, a bar/restaurant across the street, and had a great time.
All I've been doing is socializing and talking to people, but actually I'm itching to leave, and have been since this morning. Tomorrow I'm planning a late start to a 13.5 mile day--in the rain--to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to. I'm hoping to arrive after it stops raining, maybe between 6 and 7. 13.5 miles might sound like an easy hike at this point, but two 4,000 foot peaks, Crocker Mountain and Sugarloaf Mountain, are in the way. The hike starts with a 3,000 foot climb away from the trailhead.
I'll shelter or camp at 3k feet. That should be no problem with the bag liner as long as there aren't any bugs. The liner weighs me down another 440 grams but feels very warm.
Early in the morning I'll hit the post office and mail my Ursack to Vermont. Good riddance and it'll help offset the weight of my hot kitchen. Then I'll hit the market to pick up any needed food. An hour to pack, say goodbye to the problematic Altras, which have nevertheless carried me this far, and I'm ready for a 3.5 day hike to Andover.

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598325,"My pack's base weight this morning was almost 18 pounds (8 kg). UPS delivered a sleeping bag liner, a stove, a titanium pot, cup, and spork, and Under Armour 1/4 zip pullover. I also gained Jaybird's shirt, though now I'll ask if maybe I could forward it. Not to mention the 230 gram (net) fuel canister, which actually weighs 356 grams. Gram Nazis beware.
I thought I was on the 11 o'clock shuttle. The plan was to hike in 13.5 or so, hike until it stops raining, and then camp dry-ish. I walked down to the Post Office and sent ahead my Ursack, my eyeglass case, and sleeves. If I don't need the latter two by Hanover, they can go home. I was also in a hurry.
The rain wasn't letting up, meaning there would be no views. On the way back from the PO an executive decision was made to bunk another night. A group of ladies and Carrot Top (who got in last night) decided the same way. I have another day to break in my Salamons and figure out my food resupply. I still need a UPS package with camera batteries. I can cut my fingernails. I highly recommend Fotter's Market, across the street. (There's vegan ice cream.)
So, I spent the day--my third zero--getting myself ready and hanging around. Am I still gaining fitness or am I losing it?
It was an excellent stay. I'm well fed and rested, and I certainly can't say enough good things about Trout. He SOBOed last year (2017) and is very dedicated to the hiker community. Y'all should stay with him to help make it a success.","Stratton at ME Hwy 27

After climbing 3000 feet from the highway, I was hoping to be treated to some nice views from Crocker Mountain. They were there, but they were nothing like spectacular Saddleback, which I was to see in a couple of days.
The rain started just before I made the campsite at the South Branch of the Carrabassett. In keeping with my new outlook--taking it easy for a bit--I decided that the smart move would be to camp at the ford rather than try to crawl up Sugarloaf and Spaulding in the rain.

A little communism goes a long way--81 years later we too can suffer along with them.
After a few minutes playing with my stove, I was caught in the rain once again. What to do but stay? A thousand feet ain't what it used to be, so there was no way I was going down to Orbeton Stream and back up to the Poplar Ridge Lean-to.

We got to talking and she told me that one of the things she missed was tea. Well, out came the stove again and the 1000-year pu'erh. I hope it gave her a good trail memory. On her way out she told us a riddle. Nobody could solve it and I can't remember the details.
I sheltered that night, with a group of NOBOs and one SOBO, Old Canadian, who's actually from New York state but his accent is close enough. He's making 20 mile days (easily) and is thinking of slowing down just for the hell of it. He even packed in hot dogs to cook, over a real fire of course, and gave several away as trail magic.

On the way out of Poplar Ridge, a group I'd met in Stratton caught up with me. Hiking with them was Calories, who I met during my zero at the AT Lodge in Millinocket. (If you're reading this--I lost my P-38 can opener already.) I had also had a good conversation with Nurse, who is a Male nurse and told me about the state of the profession. They're a good group of young people and I'm sorry I don't remember all of their names. I ""let"" them pass but caught up and passed them on the Horn.
Once on the Horn, the trail was exposed. You could see the main summit 1.6 miles away. Fortunately the col was easy to hike through. There are definitely some breathtaking views from both. Another taste of the Whites and a very worthwhile climb.
On the way down, I met Heisenberg. He told me about the hostel he was staying at--Fieldstone. It's run by Sherpa, another alum, and is owned by the same people as the Stratton Motel. I walked the 0.3 over to the Hiker Hut, where Down East was trying to hitch into Rangeley, also to Fieldstone. I was persuaded by his arguments in favor of electricity and went back to meet Heisenberg. Sherpa arrived a few minutes later and we were saved.

I felt a few drops of rain at the road crossing, and didn't want to go up Bemis in the rain, so I decided to camp after crossing the ford of Bemis Stream. There are a few good campsites there, close to water. Of course, it didn't rain.

On the steep descent to Sawyer Notch I started getting pain in my right knee, behind the kneecap, when bending. For the rest of the hike, I would wonder if I would make the 3:50 pick up. And for quite a while, the 5:50 pickup. There was a 1500 foot climb to Wyman Mountain before I would reach some easy slope. Medical evacuation would be incredibly embarrassing.
Thankfully, the pain was related to descent under load, and I didn't have any problems with the ascent or the gentle slope down to East B Hill Road. Still, I nervously rested for a couple of minutes every couple of hundred feet of ascent. I didn't bother photographing a nice waterfall that I sat in front of for 15 minutes. I took it very slow and I wasn't sure I would make the 3:50 pick up until I was about an hour from the road.

I took another zero at HNH, then the next day, with the knee still tight, I decided to zero again but moved to Pine Ellis Lodging. Little Red, who had other business there, and I got a ride from Yukon on his way to the trailhead. I thanked him for the stay and assured him it was nothing personal. He joked about me hitching a ride back with him at 5:30.
While at Pine Ellis, I met a few northbounders who told me about the notch and surrounding terrain. I met northbounder Don't Care and section hiker Willow, who's from Madison, and we had some nice conversation.
If my knee holds out, I think I'll be fine and up to speed (the slow speed through the Whites) in no time. Little Red, a former high school athlete, told me that I probably need to stretch my hamstring. My knee was still stiff today but attempts to stretch deep hamstrings seemed to help quite a bit. I think I'll need to make them a habit.
I also ordered trekking poles. Better late than never, but too bad I didn't do this a few days ago to adjust on some easier terrain.
Tomorrow, on the 9th, I'm going to do a two-day semi-slack from East B Hill Road to Grafton Notch. (Normally this is a one-day slack.) Thankfully I've got my pack weight below 10 kg. 
Then I'll return to Andover to overnight at Pine Ellis and resupply, from where it should be three days to Gorham. This also gives me the option of taking another zero before the Mahoosuc thing. But by this point I'm feeling like the last SOBO, and it would be nice to catch some of the people I've hiked with.

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600044,"10.3 is what I did over two days, nursing my right knee. I had a shamefully easy nearo to Fry Notch Lean-to and a less easy day down to Grafton Notch.
At Fry Notch I was bored, apart from brief conversation with lunching NOBOs. There are more and more of them--I fear the bubble is coming, but I've heard it's still in New York. Please God, not the Whites. I ate cold-soaked ramen, stretched my legs, and read books on my phone.
A group of loud Quebecois girl scouts camped at some tentsites near the shelter, but I and the NOBO I was sharing the shelter with fell asleep anyway. However, we were awakened at 1:30, in the middle of the night, when the girls broke camp and headed up Baldpate by headlamp.
The next day when I awoke, my knee felt even better. I would have added another 500 feet to Baldpate just for the exercise. I took it piece by piece, and it did not seem like a hard 1500 feet.
Balpate had spectacular views of where I'd come from and what was to come. It was well worth the effort. And the laziness of starting late, after the weather cleared. The top was a windy, steep piece of rock. It was beautiful.
I arrived at the highway at around 1:30, ready to wait until the shuttle picked me up at 6. As I was talking to a couple of SOBOs who were resting at the trail crossing, a man came up and asked if any of us were Moose, because Pine Ellis is waiting in the parking lot for him. I excused myself and got an early ride to the hostel. That was doubly fortunate since David, the driver, said that he hadn't been told about a 6PM pick up there.
With my knee doing well, I've decided to just nearo tonight and head up Old Speck tomorrow morning. All I have is a 7 mile day until the campground north of Mahoosuc Notch. It's also the best move to make for the weather.
I've decided not to fear the upcoming terrain. By now, I've heard the full gamut of opinion. I've had NOBOs tell me it was hard and I've had section hikers tell me it was easy and overhyped. If it's like today's hike--not to forget the spectacular views--then it'll be fine. As long as the rock isn't slippery with rain. There's a 40% chance tomorrow but Sunday and Monday look OK. I should get lucky and zero during rain again in Gorham.
I've resupplied with too much food again and picked up my new Black Diamond hiking sticks. Let's see how many times I trip over them on the way to Gorham!

Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600554,"The 3000 foot climb out of Grafton Notch wasn't as difficult as I'd imagined, but I did get my extra 500 feet of exercise. When I got to the stream 1000 feet above the parking lot, I continued down the AT in the wrong direction and lost about 500 feet of elevation. When I heard cars, I turned to Guthook. Apparently I had gone up a blue blaze that was part of Grafton Notch State Park. It made a loop with the AT and I didn't notice.
On the way up to Old Speck, I met Smokie, a southbound flip-flopper. We ended up spending the night at the AMC shelter at Speck Pond instead of going down the Mahoosuc Arm in possibly wet conditions. I feared the Arm more than the Notch. We hit it off very well and decided to help each other through the Notch and hike on together to Gorham.
Descending the Arm sucked, and we debated whether it was better or worse than the Abol Trail. Probably better, but still shitty.
The Notch was something else. It took us four hours to carefully ease our way over, around, and through the talus field. Having a great partner made a huge difference. It was a mental game and began to annoy me as it dragged on, but eventually it came to an end.
The rest of the trail was easier, but more of the same. It's definitely a different trail than in Maine. We were tired when we got to Gorham, but not defeated.
We stayed at the Royalty Inn because everything was full. I was able and willing to take a complete zero but Smokie had a stricter timeline and so we parted ways. I think that in retrospect, the brief time we hiked together will be one of my most cherished memories of the trail.
At the convenience store, I ran into Calories, who's hiked all the way to Pinkham Notch and said that his group was tired. That's what's waiting for me. Tomorrow, I'm heading into the Wildcats, towards Pinkham Notch, from where I'll return to Gorham to resupply for the Whites. Out of the frying pan and into the fire.","Grafton Notch, ME 26

That doesn't mean I can make miles, though. I think I'm hauling ass and then I look at the Garmin and stand corrected. It gets a lot harder after Imp Campsite.
I spent the first night at a stealth site that was maybe 0.2 from a Forest Protection Area where I got my swamp water from. It was just under 4000 feet and I used my bag liner again.
I was up at 4 and got moving at 6. My gas canister ran out in the middle of making tea, so I went without. Rain was supposed to start at around 2 and I was hoping to make the Pinkham V.C. by noon but actually got there around 2, just as the weather was rolling in.The descent from WC was a pain in the ass. I slipped and fell twice. Once my pack saved me from hitting my back or head against the previous step. The other time, I slid down a slick piece of stone but caught myself before anything too exciting happened. The descent was like a buffet of the various obstacles I've already faced. I went from dish to dish, piling it on until my legs felt tired. There was Coke at the VC and it felt great to be going into Gorham again.
Today, I'll be zeroing at the Libby House to avoid rain, and to rest my legs for Mt. Madison. I definitely feel it when I go up the stairs to the sleeping loft, which reminds me of an orphanage with its rows of real beds. The crowd here is pretty cool--there was even a group of SOBOs to hang out with. They left this morning with a box of wine and a 12 pack of Bud Light, so maybe I'll pass them and avoid being the last one.

The knee had meniscus surgery in 2011 after a minor tear I made while training with a backpack full of water bottles. Many times, I've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory due to hubris. If this journey is about anything, it's about tempering that hubris with senex energy.
I hoped my knee would be better the next day, and I'd continue up Madison, but when I woke up yesterday it was stiff and still a bit painful. I decided to hike back to Gorham and zero. I can't hike on hope. Hope is the last evil that flew from Pandora's box.
On the way down from Osgood (an easy 5 miles or so), I ran into Catch Up and Danish at the very next site, just downhill from mine. It was nice to see some friendly faces, even if they were as far behind as I was.
Today, a personal issue that weighed me down through the Wildcats appears to be resolving itself. I'm going to take advantage of this time to reorganize. I'm going to eat and stretch, try to socialize as best I can, and shake as much weight from my pack as possible.

Yesterday, I was lazy. I admit I was reluctant to leave. Late Start and I had talked a lot about our favorite restaurants, our experiences living in New York City, scuba diving in warm climates, and other splendors of civilization.
It was high time to remind myself that I live in the woods. Not in Gorham, New Hampshire.
At the Pinkham VC, I spent a good deal of time talking to Popsicle, who I've run into a few times now. She's well travelled and has checked off a lot of my buckit list items, including Antarctica and Kilimanjaro.
Then I hiked in to an unguthooked campsite about half a mile before Osgood. Madison could wait while I dredged up motivation. I also have a cold.
Today, I hiked to Madison Spring Hut. There was no way I would have made the Dungeon, and the Perch is allegedly beautiful but about a mile off trail.
I dragged this morning because of the cold, took my careful time on the rocks, and by the time I made the hut it was a little after noon. It's not that the hike up Madison and then on the ridgeline is hard. It's extremely painstaking and annoying.At the hut, I spent ten bucks on some mushroom soup, five blueberry muffins, and ginger and chai tea. I hung around to see if a space would empty. They get a call at 1:00 with cancellations and reservation changes. No such luck. And no work for stay either--I was too early. I was told that it's reserved for hikers who arrive around five or six and have no other options. My only option was to hike down to the USFS campsite along Valley Way. It's not a bad option and I don't mind having to do it. Disingenuous as the AMC employees may be, it's the principle I don't like here.
Late Start and I had talked about Anthony Bourdain, whom she had met. I told her one of the things I liked about him was his politics. So let me be political.
Work for stay might sound like a good deal, until you realize what's going on here. The Appalachian Mountain Club is a private club monopolizing public land. They receive a huge subsidy by being allowed to operate in the White Mountains National Forest. You already paid them for that thin, tasteless soup when you paid your taxes. Their facilities are directly on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, yet they are not required to serve the needs of all of the trails users. And they are a private club, not subject to even the theoretical democratic oversight that a public agency like NPS is subject to.
Giving them free labor to sleep on a floor is a little ridiculous. I asked because I was lazy, but I'm glad I didnt get it. If the whole trail was like this there would be no thru-hiking at all.","Pinkham Notch

Thanks to AMC I was able to replenish at Madison Spring Hut after climbing the 700 feet back up.
It's slow going but the trail here isn't so bad apart from a few annoying spots. I should have used the Salomons in Maine and the cushy, rock-resistant Altras here. In the morning, I was hiking cairn to cairn in the clouds, but it cleared as the power of the sun grew stronger.
At the cog railway, I tried to hitch a ride on the train but the conductor didn't stop. Tourists took pictures of me joking around.
A signpost for the Westside Trail was missing the (AT) symbol, so I accidentally blue blazed around the summit. The hut was in view and tempted me greatly, but skipping Mt. Wash would be like skipping Clingman's Dome. Worse. So when I got to the AT, I hiked 0.6 back up to the summit.
I was hungry and getting tired. With a hundred tourists contending for their ""summit"" photos, I just tagged it with my Garmin and went to the VC to eat pizza and drink orange juice. By the time I left, clouds had rolled in and obscured the hut, 1.5 miles below.
When I got to the hut, I was tired, still a bit sick, and dehydrated. Fortunately, there was one bunk left in the dungeon. An interesting character with piercings and tattoos complained about the $10 fee and claimed he was going to cowboy camp, but I saw him wandering around the warm hut at 4 AM. As you know, the $10 is not my issue with AMC and I would gladly pay more to stay in a nicer, warmer dungeon.
I barely socialized with the NOBOs and tried to go to sleep at 7. Upstairs, a room full of tourists were being led by staff into some kind of floor stomping celebration, so in reality it was later.

She said that AMC is keeping track of overflow and is considering adding facilities. I have the budget to stay at every hut, but there are too many variables to make reservations.
The o-ring seal on my Sawyer Squeeze finally deformed into uselessness. Fortunately, a NOBO named Flower Child had given me a solid rubber one, when we met on Wildcat. I made the switch and hoped an actual rubber hose fitting would be more durable.

The descent down Webster Cliffs was terrible. Especially after all of that nice trail from Washington all the way down to where the AT leaves Crawford Path. I trust my life--or at least my face--to carbide on granite. It gets tiresome.
At Crawford Notch, the US 302, I met NOBOs Thumper and Skywalker, and we hitched to the Crawford Notch General Store and Campground for showers, laundry, and resupply. Although not known as hiker friendly, they are listed in the book and I had no problems besides being charged a $15 surcharge for a 1 night stay. Having managed a motel before, I understand that policy is policy and I don't act like an entitled day hiker.
The next day, as I was trying to hitch out, the owner and his wife gave me a lift back to the trailhead in their pickup truck. Very nice people.
This was a nearo and I only made it up to Ethan Pond Shelter. The AMC caretaker, Taylor, was a badass outdoorswoman who was into alpine climbing more than hiking. She hung around the shelter talking to Big Red, Cosmic, a couple of other NOBOs, and myself. We agreed that it was possible to resupply on Mt. Wash, which I didn't do but should have. Later, I met Alchemist, who would have been interesting to talk to had he not left early the next morning. How often do you run into another alchemist?
All of the AMC campground caretakers were great. Guyot was staffed by Chef Boyardee, SOBO 2017, a very smart physics student. Garfield Ridge had Rachel, friendly and nice but less interested in fraternizing with hiker trash. Another SOBO was at the shelter. It was 127, who started at the Big Kahuna on August 17th and passed me that day. Amazing.
At Crawford Notch, I had resupplied as best I could (its possible) but weighed my gas and decided against carrying another cylinder. That was a mistake, since I had to ration strictly and the huts and campgrounds didn't have any abandoned gas. At Garfield Ridge, Jingle had given me some miso soup but I could only make the broth, not the noodles. I survived largely on Snickers and Clif Bars. At one hut, I bought 10 Snickers for $20. At another hut, the volunteer wouldn't let me charge the soup and cake to my credit card. I told him that all I have is money but can't spend it on anything I actually need.
When I got to Franconia Notch, it was Friday of Labor Day weekend and everything was full. I was already dying for a zero but unwilling to try to shuttle or hitch 40 miles to a motel charging $280 a night. I ""resupplied"" with Snickers and Clif at the annoying Flume VC, stealth camped at a river a couple of miles in, and the next morning pushed on to Kinsman Notch. I got reservations for the 3rd and 4th at The Notch hostel.
The Whites are breathtaking but the day I got to Kinsman, I hated them. For ten days I chilled in my own sweat and was desperate to get into a town. A NOBO and I hitched into Lincoln early and were saved. The locals complained about the heat, but for me it was a dream come true to be warm and dry(ish) again. Camel likes the heat.
Today, I already feel better. Only Moosilauke stands between me and nicer, faster trail. Tomorrow I'm going to slackpack over it and meet up with Trout (NOBO 2017) over in Glencliff, where we'll catch up on each others adventures since Stratton.","US Hwy 302 at Crawford Notch
