Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569873,"Ok so let me give you some background on my trail name.  I was not officially named on the trail but Pokey has been a nickname for a long time so I decided to go with it.  If something changes I will update it but for now I have embraced it and will go with it.  It also embraces my hiking style; poking along getting where I want when I want.  
First I am a police officer, specifically a Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) but I am a sworn officer and have only recently moved it CSI work.  I will not elaborate further but if you would like to know more just ask.  Anyway, when I was in the Academy I was made class leader, a job I took very seriously.  So I made sure everyone was cleaned up etc. and was the last to leave.  One of the instructors had the misfortune of being behind me for the long one lane drive from the academy to the main road which did not make him very happy.  I of course obeyed the speed limit because I was scared to death of getting in trouble and being put in the dreaded pit.  Well I was informed the next day my name was Pokey and it has stuck to this day, so why not go with it.  And besides… I kind of like it.",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Sat",0
Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569751,"Ok so I have been planning this C&O canal trip for a while but I guess it isn’t going to happen.  I am currently employed full time with a pension so I cannot afford to just drop everything and head off into the wild (although I wish I could and respect those that have done so).  I will not use this as a political platform for certain ideas that I deem ridiculous or stupid.  In fact, I applaud the people that persue their dreams even if I believe some of them to be misguided.  Perhaps, that is my umbilical cord to society that I cannot cut and will not cut because of the pension and therefore live my life based on a retirement plan that will likely involve more work.  I also have three children and a wife whom I adore.  I was planning on hitting the C&O canal this summer for a long weekend trip but with the delays of summer baseball, weddings and grad school I am going to postpone the trip until next year.  This also gives me time to gather more gear and hopefully trim some weight from my pack.  I’ve started with a hopeful weight of less than 25 pounds and have been training with the same.  However, after reading countless posts I don’t think I am going to make the trip possible this year.  My plan is to finish grad school.  Two classes left!  So, around this time next year I will be free.  I am hoping for a May/June departure for my C&O canal hike.  It won’t be a through hike but more of a trial run to see if I can handle the life of a hiker.  I really just want to unplug and get away.  I will elaborate more about my profession later, but trust me I need it.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Fri",0
Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569752,"So I had the chance to spend the weekend camping with my son and his Trail Life Troop.  It was a good weekend despite the lack of sleep.  The boys had a lot of fun and it was unseasonably cold, but it was better than being sweaty all weekend.  We arrived Friday night and set up our camp, which took the majority of the evening.  There was a brief ceremony and some talk about what would happen the next day and an itinerary etc.  An uneventful first night and we all turned in around 2200 – 2300.  Needless to say there would be no sleep for any of the adults, I think the boys slept well, but when I was a kid I could pretty much sleep anywhere too.  I even had a cot but I am pretty sure that cot is French for medieval torture device because that sumbitch was not comfortable at all.  
 

Saturday started out cool again and we all had breakfast.  Wait I mean the boys got to eat breakfast and I had one tiny plate of sausage and eggs.  Wait what did I pay ten bucks for?  Damn I’m still hungry.  Thankfully I packed plenty of snacks and had some back up Mountain House meals on standby.  I did pack my trusty stove and cooking gear.  So anyway I pummeled some of the snacks and sandwiches I had brought along.  
The troops had a bunch of different activities for the boys set up and we moved around doing different things ranging from an obstacle course, branding (wood) - I know some people just freaked out a bit, well not that anyone is actually reading this – sling shots, airsoft, fire building and hatchet throwing.  We broke for lunch around noon and I was starving and looking forward to the brilliant lunch of hot dogs and chips.  Whatever it's fine, but I am somewhat of a gourmet so I was feeling uninspired.  Oh well hot dogs and chips here we come.  One hot dog and tiny bag of chips… where is the rest?  Oh man you are killing me smalls.  Anyway I fired down my nitrate cicle and two bags of chips and yep still hungry.  So back to the snacks.  Here is a clue guys the fact that you bought a tub of pretzels and animal crackers and everyone is pummeling them like a swarm of locusts, maybe we should have brought more food.  
Moving on, yes I am still hungry.  The highlight of the afternoon was we could continue the stations set up or we could go hike on the AT.  *raises hand and waves it frantically* Me, ohh pick me, me, me, me.  *gets called on*  Go hike!  Yes I had brought a day pack and loaded it up with as much as I could and my trekking poles, and my Vibrams.  I entertained the notion of wearing my Xero sandals and I am glad I didn’t (more on that later).  Oh did I mention that while I was wearing my Xeros around camp some dude comes up to me all authoritative like and says “Excuse me sir can I speak with you a moment,” and waves me to the side.  Instantly my guard goes up and I’m like, “Sure what’s up?”  He points to my sandals and tells me I need to have closed toed shoes because “camp rules” require them.  I said man I didn’t see a sign.  He continues to tell me the rules were explained in the opening meeting (that I wasn’t invited to).  Sure bro I have closed toed shoes, Vibram Five Fingers here we come.  Take that rules nazi!  He explained that he didn’t want the boys to see me wearing them and think it was ok.  *TWEEEET* (that’s a whistle blowing) timeout Hoss.  You mean to tell me that as an almost 40 year old adult I can’t make my own decision to wear sandals if I want?  We are supposed to be teaching these boys values right?  How about authority and respect?  Yeah that’s what I thought how about no you can’t wear sandals because you are a kid those are the rules.  He is an adult and can make his own choices about safety.  Why is it that everyone must conform because one kid might be offended?  *middle finger*  His reasoning was that they might catch a root and get hurt and that could end their weekend in the hospital.  Well buddy that is my choice if I catch a root and bust my foot up that is on me and I will deal with it, besides it won’t be the first time.  Oh allow me to add that we are camping in one of the most beautiful pristine grassy fields that I have ever seen and there isn’t a root in the entire thing.  Ok, rant over.  
Ok so we decide to go hiking and I bust out my Vibrams trekking poles and load up my pack for extra weight (just for practice) although it wasn’t nearly heavy enough.  Oh did I add that I was regaling the leaders and kids alike with my knowledge of the AT.  How long it was, the states it went through, etc.  Yep, AT nerd and I will through hike it someday, that is my first retirement goal.  I will retire in April of 2031.  Yes it is still a way off but there is an end in sight.  So where was I?  That’s right the proposed hike of the AT!  Yes, this is going to be the best part of the trip who is excited?  Yep… this guy.  Allow me to throw another damper on the whole thing… somehow I get elected to transport all of the kids to the hiking trail while all of the other adults ride in the same car.  *confused face*  WTF did I do to you guys?  Anyway, the discussion on the way to the site involved the worst way to torture and kill someone ( I thought you kids were religious?).  Anyway we get there and I am pumped I leap out of the car grab my gear and we all set off.  Well this path was created by Satan himself.  Like seriously, there has to be pointy bullshit rocks on every part of the trail?  I swear some asshole comes along every night and replaces them to fuck with everybody.   
So we head off and there are some guys with younger kids who I immediately realize are not going to do well.  Thankfully, their dads turned around.  As soon as we got off the climb it was nothing but bouldering for quite a while.  The boys loved it, and very much needed it.  I am glad I had my poles because they were well worth it.  See the pictures because it was some gnarly stuff with zero reward.  There were no beautiful vistas or amazing views.  Don’t bother with the White Rock path because it sucks and will land you nowhere.  
I decided to forge ahead because the kids were pissing me off and I didn’t want to see one of them plummet to their death.  Finally I reached the AT.  It was a scene out of a movie where the heavens parted and I skipped lacadasically toward the now pristine trail.  Honestly, all sarcasm aside it was pretty magical.  I could only take it all in.  There was a nice stealth camp site there at the end.  However, all you had to do was look down a couple of the trampled paths to see toilet paper lining the woods.  Come on guys can’t you bury that shit… literally.  I had a few moments to reflect, relax and take in the woods and it was amazing.  I eventually had to relive myself and of course the boys show up…   
In the mean time while I was relieving myself the boys decided that my trekking poles could now be divided amongst them.  Sorry fellas, dividing the spoils of war involves conquering the one who owns the prize.  In this case you boys better bring a lunch and a lot of help.  Needless to say I had my poles back in a matter of moments.  Perhaps threatening to burn their tents around them while they slept was not a good idea. (Kidding)  Anyway, finally we are on the AT!  It was goddamn magical, I felt like I was in Disney World, there were birds chirping and chipmunks singing; I'm pretty sure Snow White kissed me on the cheek at one point.  It was awesome we ran across two through hikers one was a male with a small black lab that the boys thought was amazing because he was carrying his own pack.  The second was a female with curly brown hair.  My biggest regret to this day is that I did not engage them or ask for their names, or at the very least give them food.   I know hikers love food and I put extra in my pack for that reason.  I am sorry to you two, I will never know you or your fates, but I wish I had given you that Clif bar on that day or at least taken a selfie with you because you inspire so many of us.  Maybe if the fates command it our paths will cross, but I wish you well on your journey and only wish I could support it further.  
Ok, now more complaining, so this AT hike they advertised consisted of about ¼ mile of actual AT hiking the rest was that sadomasochistic White Rocks trail and that damn return trail that lacked the bouldering but maintained the rocks.  Hey, you know what… FUCK YOU PENNSYLVANIA!  I haven’t even tested any of your other hikes but if this is a taste (and from reading it is) you SUCK!!  

It was a nice weekend though and I got to put my feet on the AT which made me very happy.  More to come!

Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572422,"Ok so well I have been looking at the C&O because of it being close and the history behind it.  The most important thing to me was logistics and I can jump a train from Union Station and then hike my way back to DC and wouldn't need the support of anyone and wouldn't have to be shuttled around.  It seemed like the best idea for me.  I've had some people tell me that the trail isn't very good and I should probably pick something else.  If anyone else has any comments I would appreciate the input.  It is probably a trail that I will do eventually just because, but I was doing this hike as a present to myself for finishing grad school.  I have some friends interested in going so I may switch to a section hike of the AT with them, but who knows.  I do know I want to be out there stinking it up and unplugging for a while.  So I guess we will se what happens over the next year.  If anyone actually reads this let me know if you have hiked or biked the C&O and what you think.  Thanks!Pokey",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Tue",0
Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579775,"Ok, so it has been a while and there have been some developments and most likely a reevaluation of the situation.  First things first I have been having issues with my left hip since around the beginning of the year.  I thought it was just bursitis/tendonitis and tried to stretch it out to no avail.  Finally, I went to the doctor and he confirmed the tendonitis/bursitis and was given anti-inflammatories and stretches.  That didn’t work and the stretches made the pain worse.  I went to physical therapy and it felt great while I was in there and about the time I walked out it started hurting again.  I missed some appointments here and there because of a death in the family and other obligations.  So we are now into August when I finally get a Cortisone shot, which immediately takes care of the tendonitis.  A few days later I notice a pain in the back of my hip.  I figure it is just lingering tendonitis and it will go away, but this definitely felt different.  So, after more Dr. visits MRIs and X-rays I am diagnosed with a torn labrum in my left hip, no Bueno for sure.  I go see a specialist last Tuesday and he tells me I have to have surgery to repair the tear and have my hip bone reshaped because it pinches the labrum and caused the tear.  Super, let’s do it doc I have a hike to get ready for in the spring/summer.  I go to the scheduling girl and she tells me that it is going to be $750 out of pocket because my insurance won’t cover the one step of the procedure.  Mega no Bueno.  Grrrrrrr.  And I have really good insurance, so it isn’t that.  I also find out I will be on crutches for 2 weeks and in a brace.  Awesome! (sarcasm).  So there goes some new hiking gear out the window.  So then my only options for the surgery were Halloween, which only 10 days away, or Dec 5th or 19th.  Super looks like I will be out of commission for Christmas.  Oh well what are you gonna do?  I will keep everyone posted on my health status and how it affects my trip.  Recovery time is about 4-6 months from what I read, so I may be moving my hike to the fall, I don’t know yet depends on how it shakes out.  
 

On other notes I have had a few people tell me that the C&O is flat and boring, which is not what I am looking for.  It really was for logistical reasons and some nostalgia.  When I was a kid my mom tried to take me to the C&O, we got lost on the Metro and it was a complete debacle.  So, I figured why not make it there now?  I have changed my plans and have decided to hike a section of the AT.  I will still take the train to Harpers Ferry and then head north on the AT.  My wife’s family is from Sunbury, PA and she goes right through Duncannon on her way to their house.  I will just have her pick my stinky ass up there on her way through.  Thanks, everyone for the feedback on the C&O I really appreciate you saving me from making that mistake.  I will probably still hike it at some point for the reasons above though.  So AT section hike here I come.  I really would rather do that anyway.   So, look for my blog under the AT section as I will be moving it there.  
I also purchased a Hennessy Explorer Deluxe hammock today on EBAY for $139!!  I couldn’t believe it was so cheap, that is like at least a $60 savings.  I have always loved sleeping in a hammock and have read so many good things about it that I had been looking at it for a while.  I never really liked tent camping anyway, the ground is just damn uncomfortable.  So, I will keep you guys posted!  Thanks for reading!

Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582153,"Ok so it is time for an update, I had surgery in December to repair the torn labrum in my left hip.  The surgery went well according to my Doctor.  He said the tear was larger than expected and it had to be sewn up in three places, he also had to reattach the labrum to the bone and shave down my bone because the shape of my hip pinches the labrum and would cause the injury to occur again.  My doctor is supposed to be the best in the area and only does hip, so he knows his stuff.  The surgery was fine in and out in about an hour and a half.  The only problem I had was when the dang nurse helping me to the car kept locking my seatbelt and I had to take it off three times.  Came home and was doped up for a couple of days.  It was pretty uncomfortable and the brace and crutches were terrible.  I ended up sleeping on my couch because I couldn’t lift my leg into bed.  
The holidays went well and it was an all hiker present Christmas for me!  Yay!  I scored a Hennessey Explorer on Ebay for $139 so I was pretty stoked about that.  I have always loved hammocks and almost strung one in my college house much to the chagrin of my mother.  I can’t wait to take this thing out.  I have it hung up in my basement for trial runs.  I’m still having a hard time with the ridgeline and tie outs, but I will figure that out.  I love the snakeskins though because they make for a very easy breakdown and set up for the hammock.  I am going to have to figure out my insulation, but I’m hoping to go during warmer weather and just take the old Marmot sleeping bag I have instead of buying a new quilt.  I also gifted myself some nick nacks, like a spice bullet for cooking, rain gear and a few other things.  I will have to update these on my gear list.  I’m still struggling with buying a new pack or not.  I have an old EMS pack that will do the trick, but it is kind of heavy and I wouldn’t mind something new.  I should have taken advantage of the black Friday sales, but I had already blown my wad on Christmas for the kids, etc.  I have been looking at Osprey and Mountainsmith packs, but I can’t decide.  I really need to try them on I think.  I may just roll with the EMS pack for now and see how the hike goes and then upgrade.  What was funny was that after seeing all of the hiking gear my wife said, “So I guess you are serious about this hiking thing?”  Yes, dear I told you that I have dreamed about this for years.  I wish I could do a thru-hike, but for now I will content myself with sections of the AT that are close by.  And this is easy because I will go from Harpers Ferry to Duncannon which is about 125 miles and my wife has to drive right through Duncannon to get to her parent’s house, so win win for everyone!  I figure it will take me about 10 daysish to do that part, so it will be a nice vacation and give my wife time to visit her family at the same time.  
So when… therein lies the problem because I don’t know how long the recovery is going to be.  Every time my hip hurts I panic thinking it isn’t fixed.  I am currently on my 4th week of therapy and we have been doing more range of motion stuff, but it wasn’t until last week I could get my own socks on and it is still a struggle.  So I will just take it day by day and see how it goes.  I also just started my Thesis for finishing Grad School, so I have that fun to look forward to over the next few months.  The end is in sight however, and I will graduate in April.  Originally, I was going to reward myself with the hike, but my doctor said it could be until April until I can run / hike again, so I guess we will wait and then baseball season starts, and I don’t want to miss my time with the boys out on the diamond, I love being out there with the kids, so much fun.  Being called Coach is almost as fulfilling as being called Dad and the boys crack me up, plus I have a great Head Coach who is a good friend and we work well together.  So I can’t miss out on baseball season for hiking.  So maybe over the summer, or before fall baseball starts… who knows.  
Ok well that is my update for now, I see the doctor again tomorrow so hopefully there is good news.

Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610443,"OK so I wish there was good news to be shared in this post.  However, there is not.  I wanted to be sharing my start date, or nerding out on gear or something like that.  Instead I am going to talk about being wounded still.  If anyone is following along, I had surgery in Dec. 2017 and it went well, rehab was good and around August 2018 I started hurting again.  I am sure this coincided with me wearing a duty belt again and climbing into and out of a patrol car that is about 4 inches off the ground.  It also doesn’t help that I rushed back to work so I could be on call to help my unit only to be betrayed by other backstabbing members and get transferred.  So I should have stayed hurt, but didn’t to take one for the team and end up getting screwed in the end.  My fault, I should have seen it coming.    

It is a blessing though because I was burned out, I couldn’t handle much more and so here I am.  I have more days off and way less stress.  I also have much more time to hike and more days to do so.  The only problem is, my body or I guess my left hip, will not comply.  I am still in as much pain as I was before and I have a feeling I am looking at another torn labrum, or at least the re-tear of the same labrum.  I had an MRI on Friday and have to see my doctor again to see what the diagnosis is.  On the last visit I found out that I grew a new bone in the hip that may be causing some of the pain, but it still feels like it did before and I think I still have a torn labrum.  I really wish I could identify how I keep hurting myself so I can avoid it.  
I have also decided that I may not undertake the AT section hike but go for a smaller trail like the Loyalsock Trail.  There are a few options for me on that one and there is the Loyalsock Loop Trail that runs from World’s end State Park for about 22 miles that I could do on a weekend.  Or the full trail which is 50ish miles and I could do in a few days.  The Loyalsock trail is only about an hour from my in-laws house so the logistics work out good and some of my college buddies are also only an hour away and are willing to go with me.  I have plenty of things planned out for that but for now I am waiting on the hip.  In the mean time I will watch videos of other hikers and read journals to dream of the chance that I will hopefully have someday.  When I do attempt a trail I will have a Youtube channel and post links here, I will also do a gear video for the pre-hike etc.  Just gotta get the hip right first.  If anyone is still keeping up thanks for following along, sorry it has been over a year since my last post.  I really thought I was going to be able to actually post about a hike.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Sun",0
Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613706,"So I was right and I do have a a torn labrum of the same hip, not sure how I did it, but the doctor confirmed yesterday.  So, I require another surgery to repair it.  I am tired of not being able to stand for more than 10 min and not being able to walk by the end of the day.  The hiking Gods are apparently against me.  I'm not sure when I am getting cut open, but I'd like to get it out of the way and be good to go by the spring so maybe I can actually go on a hike.  I can't do it until July for sure because that is when my medical stuff rolls over.  I'm thinking about shooting for July but I don't know.  I'll keep you guys posted though.  Thanks!",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0
Pokey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620976,"Alright ladies and gents here we are 1 month post surgery #2.  I had the surgery on July 16, 2019 with the same doctor as the last time.  I am told he is the specialist in the area and they were good to me the last time, so let's do it again.  Things went well but it hurt a lot more this time.  They had to remove a bone in my hip that had grown for some unknown reason.  However, I am now 1 month post-op and it all seems to be going well.  Most of my extreme pain is gone, I do have some flare ups now and again.  I still get sore standing for too long, but nothing like before.  I am hoping it keeps progressing so I can get better and better.  I need to hike...  My biggest problem is fighting with my HR department and the doctor's office with the FMLA and light-duty paperwork, what a pain in the ass.  I can say though that at least I have good insurance and my job is protected, for the most part.  I have been out of work since Memorial Day, which some would say is a blessing, it has been nice because I got to see all of my son's travel baseball games, his tryout for Team USA and All-Stars, which I may have missed if I had to work shift work.  So yes it has been nice, but at the same time I am booooorrrreeed.  I am tired of watching TV and trying to figure out things to occupy my time.  I dream of hiking and have been non-stop watching You Tube videos about it and trying to narrow down my next overnight hike.  There is a trail near my in-laws in PA called the Loyalsock Trail, there is a thru-hike option and a shorter loop trail.  I am thinking about trying the loop trail to start as a weekend thing and then maybe hitting up the thru-hike at another time.  I don't know still a long way out, I'd like to hit it next spring sometime, maybe late April/early May?  It all depends on healing because last time, at this rate I was saying the same thing and then, blamo!  Right back on the injured list.   I'll keep you campers posted.  Pokey",,View Entry,"Aug 13, Tue",0
