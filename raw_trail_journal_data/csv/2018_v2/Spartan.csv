Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584154,"First day on the trail and I wasn't even on the trail yet, lol. Hollie dropped me off at Amicalola Falls State Park and I registered my through hike with the rangers. I was 8.8 miles away from the start, Springer Mountain. After signing in and listening to a long list of things to do and not do, I was given number 331. I was excited, nervous and ready to go. So excited I didn't even take any pictures, it was hugs kisses and started walking. The hike was brutal, seemed like it was all uphill probably because it was, lol. It started drizzling about 30 minutes in and made for a slick trail. I only fell over one time, but it was OK because a huge sticker bush broke my fall, my left arm looked like I went 12 rounds with a cat, lol. Made it to the shelter around 4:00 pm, I had planned on going to Springer Mountain shelter, but word on the trail was that it was filling up fast and rain was increasing it's intensity. Black Gap is 1.5 miles shy of Springer, it was a nice shelter and only 2 other people in there with me. Father son Jim and Cole, Cole was 18 and hiking trail before College in the fall, Jim was along for first couple of weeks. Cooked up a Mountain House Beef Stew, ate dinner and settled in for my first night. Rain turned from a drizzle to full on showers through the night, a restless first night sleeping.","Amicalola Falls State Park (Elev. 1800')

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584155,"Awoke to a drizzle and overcast skies. Ate breakfast and packed up. The hike to Springer was uneventful and not to bad of a hike. When I arrived everyone who had stayed was gone except for a kid named Joe, he was chilling in a hammock waiting to see off a couple of friends who were thru hiking. He took my photo and gave me my first trail magic, a clementine. I loaded up and plowed on another 3 miles or so to the Stover Creek Shelter. I stopped here and ate lunch with a couple of gals, Donna from Myrtle Beach was one, the other didn't talk much. Loaded up again and got under way for the last 5 miles or so to Hawk Mountain Shelter. Crossed a nice stream with a foot bridge, very picturesque. The rain had stopped by the time I got to Hawk, non was coming so I set up my tent. Did camp chores, hit the privy, got water, washed up and cooked dinner. Hung out by the shelter with about a dozen other fellow hikers. One kid stood out, Zoltan, didn't get the reason for his name. He had hiked some 850 miles in 2015 before injuring his knee forcing him off trail, this was his reattempt. A very colorful guy and a wealth of knowledge, I picked his brain until nightfall. A few guys tried to get a fire going, everything was just to wet from the last 2 days of rain.","Black Gap Shelter (Elev. 3300')

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584156,"Awoke to a pretty nice day. Had breakfast and packed up camp. It was not a good start for a day of hiking when you're a little soar from walking up and down mountains all day. I almost got the trail name of ""Wrong Way"" this morning. Sometimes i just sort of look down and plow forward, not a good thing to do, lol. coming out of shelter the trail started to climb very steep. It was killing me and slow going. I'm guessing I was a quarter mile or more up this steep climb when I came upon a sign. I walked closer and closer to the sign not believing it, it said ""NOT THE AT"". I was on the side trail that goes straight up to the top of Hawk Mountain. After a few colorful French words, I turned around and went back to where the shelter trail and the AT meet. After getting my bearings and seeing a white blaze off in the distance, my journey began once again. The extra climbing was not fun, but oh well. Pushing North I went over Sassafras mountain, a very strenuous climb. The silent peacefulness was broken mid morning by automatic gun fire. It continued and was pretty loud. I was thinking either someone is really rich or there is a military base around here. Come to find out the Rangers do their mountain phase training here, HooRah! As I got closer to Gooch Mountain Shelter I crossed a really nice stream (see picture). I stopped and filtered water, cameled a bottle and had a snack while soaking my now aching foot. My knees felt great, but the pain in the ball of my left foot was getting more intense. I pushed on to Gooch and arrived late afternoon. Gooch shelter is a double decker and was packed to the gills. Here I met Ridge Runner Tom. He was another wealth of knowledge and was also a Ranger at the Ranger school in the early 70's. I set up my tent and did my usual camp chores and made dinner. The talk of the shelter was the rain on the way, it was supposed to come very early morning and not stop for 2 more days. Chatted until dark and then made my way to my tent for some shut eye.","Hawk Mountain Shelter (Elev. 3194')

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584157,"Woke up at 4:00 am to a massive thunder storm. The rain came as predicted and it came hard and heavy. I went back to sleep. Stayed warm and dry in my tent as long as I could stand it. Finally ran up to the shelter with my food bag and had breakfast. Quite a few people had already left for the day, I milled about until most had gone. There was a very slight let up in the rain so I ran back to my tent and packed up as quick as I could. Took everything back to the shelter and geared up for a rainy hike. It has been unseasonably warm the first few days of this hike and it was like hiking in a sauna in my rain coat. I tried my best to embrace the suck and hike, but I was miserable and my foot was still hurting pretty good. At the 4.6 mile mark for the day I came upon Woody Gap, A 2 lane road runs through here and there is a parking area and restrooms for day hikers. A guy in a little black Subaru rolled down his window and asked if I was Mike. I replied no, but told him laughingly I could be if it would get me out of here! He drove off and I found an overhang to stash my gear and used the facilities. A few minutes later the guy came back got out and opened the back hatch. He told me to load up and get in, I didn't hesitate, through pack and poles in the back and loaded up. This guys name was Ron Brown of Ron's Shuttle Service, a long time fixture around the trail. His car had 530,000 miles on it and he changes the oil every 2 weeks, every week during the busy season. We drove back and forth a few times between Woody Gap and another looking for Mike, finally found him and got him loaded too. Drove around some more looking for another guy and his dog, found them got them loaded up also. A full car of wet smelly hikers and a wet dog, it was glorious. Ron had asked me where I wanted to go and said cheapest closest hotel. We drove a ways and ended up in Dahlonega Ga. Ron said the ride was trail magic and tried to leave, I couldn't do it and gave him 30 bucks, he was a true trail angel to me on this day.    To say this hotel was a dump is an understatement. It was 50 bucks a night and you could smoke in the rooms. A crackhead and her kids lived right next door to me and her man was in jail. I know this because the walls were very thin and I could hear her fighting with him on the phone. The room was as clean as it could be but there were burn holes in everything. I didn't care it was the Hilton to me at that time. First thing I did was strip down and jump in the shower, hot water never felt so good. Had a packsplosion in my room, gear was everywhere. Leaves, dirt, mud and pine needles everywhere, but it was OK. Loaded up all my nasty smelling clothes and walked to the laundry. Did my laundry and went to Moe's for dinner. Stopped at a gas station and got a couple of Mt. Dews and headed back to my room. The rain was still coming and coming hard and steady, I nestled into bed and watched TV until I fell asleep.  ","Gooch Mountain Shelter (Elev. 2789')

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584158,"Woke up about 8-8:30 and checked the weather, more rain! Most of my gear was close to dry but not quite, my boots were still soaked pretty good. My foot still hurt pretty bad too so I guess I need to stay another day. Went and paid for another night and got some fresh towels (kinda fresh) lol. Took another shower and called Mamas taxi, she used to be Big Mama, but had lost a couple hundred pounds. Very nice lady, very reasonable prices and on time. She drove me to the Walmart and I ran in and resupplied while she waited for me (no charge) awesome sauce. I inquired about a ride back to the trail and she said no problem, we made arrangements for the morning and she took me back to motel. I used half a bottle of Blue Emu muscle rub on my legs and shoulders, felt pretty good. Was getting bored so I walked a little ways to the outfitter in town and bought some new inserts for my boots to see if that would ease the pain. Walked around the town square and checked out a few shops. Walked back and ate at Moe's again, it was the closest place to eat besides McDonald's. Repacked all my gear, which was dry now, boots were close. Used the rest of that bottle of Blue Emu and burrowed under the covers for another night of TV. Foot was feeling a little better, am excited to get back out.","ZERO DAY

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584159,"Woke around 8 again, walked to McDonald's and had breakfast. Came back to room showered and geared up for Mama's Taxi coming at 10:30 to pick me up. Mama was right on time again, a 20-25 minute ride back to Woody Gap. Back on trail foot is not to bad still a little painful. It will be a short day because I have to stop short of Jarrad Gap. Starting Mar.1st between Jarrad Gap and Neel Gap you have to have a bear cannister to camp. A short but slow 3-1/2 mile hike to the Lance Creek camping site wasn't to bad. The place was hit by a micro burst or something last year and trees were laying everywhere. It looked like a giant just swept them all over, crazy looking. Because of this most of the camping spots were in repair and the rest were full. I was a little worried about getting a spot but kept going in all the way to the back where 2 guys were already setting up on a pretty flat sweet spot (you can see a pic of camp in Pigweed's journal). They were very welcoming and invited me to squeeze in. 2 more guys came as I was setting up and we squeezed them in too. Another came but he had a hammock, he got off to the side and strung between 2 trees. Our little flat spot in the woods was full! Pigweed just retired and his buddy Greg was hiking with him to Neel Gap. Bean Bag and Pyro are father son, Alamo was in the hammock. We all chatted and cooked, this is where I got my trail name from Greg. Water was close, it was a great spot with great company! It was very cold that night, we talked until we couldn't feel our fingers and retired for the night.","Woody Gap (Elev. 3196')

Spartan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584160,"Woke up and stayed in my bag for awhile it was right around freezing. Once I heard someone else get up, I did too. Cooked breakfast and packed up. Everyone scattered on the trail and started hiking. Blood Mountain loomed ahead, the tallest mountain in Georgia. It was a brutal climb, but slowly and steadily I made it to the top. It was like being at Disney World up top. People and dogs everywhere, did I mention it was a gorgeous day? Tons of day hikers, but still cool as hell, you could see Atlanta 85 miles away. Hung out and ate lunch, signed the shelter log book and loaded up for what would be hell. The climb down was steep and pretty technical, lots of big step downs and rocks. every step I took felt like there was an ice pick poking into the ball of my foot. I limped into Neel Gap and quickly shed my pack and pondered what to do. I googled how far home was and called my wife to come and get me. Greg had retrieved his car and was going to take Pigweed to dinner at a BBQ joint down the mountain before heading back to Texas. I was invited so decided to tag along. Everyone from camp had made it to Neel Gap and was checked into the hostel. I stashed my pack in the bunkhouse and loaded up in the car, Pyro and Alamo came along too. Jim's Smokin Que, the food was amazing, the brisket was off the charts. Greg drove us all back to Neel Gap and departed. I hung out in the Hostel until Hollie arrived, said my goodbyes and loaded up for home. The tree of lost souls was not going to get my boots, I'll be back.","Lance Creek (Elev. 2865')
