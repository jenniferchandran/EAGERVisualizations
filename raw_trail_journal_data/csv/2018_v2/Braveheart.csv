Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584166,"Well, looks like our AT journey is already hitting a bump in the road. 
Today we found out that our Tuesday flight was cancelled. There is a huge snow storm warning in Massachusetts, and Southwest has decided to preemptively cancel all flights on Tuesday.
Flights quickly filled up, but we were able to snag one leaving on Thursday instead. 
This was a huge bummer, since we were looking forward to spending a couple days with Lion Heart's sister and her wonderful boyfriend. We really love them and get along with them, so it will be sad that our time with them will be cut short. 

We take this challenge and disappointment head on though, this is only the first big challenge the AT will throw at us.","Home

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584168,"Hey all, 
So I wanted to share with everyone our gear list, and my wife Lionheart's blog that she is also writing.

Gear List: https://lighterpack.com/r/7r5t...
That is a link to all of our gear, including weight and cost. We are super proud of our effort to get a lot of our gear on sale, stay under our budget of $2500 per person, and we got our base weight down to around 15 pounds per person! With 2 Liters of water, 5 days worth of food, and stove fuel, our total weight of our packs should be just about 30lbs max. I will definitely update more later on in the trail about how we like our gear, what we would have changed, etc. 

Lionheart's blog: http://www.athomeonthejourney....
This is a link to my wife's blog. She plans to go more in depth about things, and she already has a few posts up about facts about the AT and stuff! Check it out!

Thanks everyone :D 4 Days to go","

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584169,"I can't believe it, just 3 more days until Lionheart and I set off on the biggest adventure of our lives. 
We are doing all of the typical things today, finishing up our food prep, repacking our bags 40 times to make sure we haven't forgotten anything, cleaning the house, all of the good stuff.

We are so nervous, but at the same time are so ready for our adventure to begin. I will probably next update this page after the first day or two of our journey, and will try and upload a few pictures for everyone to see!","Home

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584452,"Will be keeping updates short and sweet since we have limited battery. We hiked pretty much the entire approach trail today.We were driven in by Lionheart's sister, and started around noon, finishing up about 7pm.The stairs were killer, and took a lot of wind out of us. Over 600 stairs, really, is that necessary :PBeautiful day, no rain, so thanks you God. We loved the first day and are so ready for more.","Amicolola Falls

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584454,"Today we finally got to step foot on the actual trail. We spent the first hour of the morning hiking the 1.5 miles to the summit of springer mountain. There we said goodbye to Theresa, the Black Swan, my sister-in-law, and continued on just the two of us.The trail really kicked our butt, but again after a few hours of hiking and almost 9 miles done, we made it to camp.We met a few really cool people along the way like Rivers with his amazing voice, LiveFree with his amazing attitude and dedication, and a couple others as well.Another beautiful day with no rain.","Springer Mountain Base

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584457,"Today was an interesting day.It started off poorly, waking up to rain and wet everything. We were very sore, and what made it worse is that i probably only got 3 hours of sleep.We started hiking, and were really proud of ourselves. We were making great time and felt like we could hike for 20 miles!Then came Sassafrass.We didnt know about Sassafrass until after the fact. That mountain, or hill, whatever you want to call it, knocked our egos down a peg or two. If you had been in earshot you would have heard us calling out for our mothers at one point.Nevertheless, we conquered it slowly, and we were rewarded with two things. The first is we met a whole bunch of trail friends that seem to be hiking the same pace as us. There was tyler and shaun, captain america, rivers again, franklinstein, and a couple others. We were also rewarded with a 3 ish miles of downhill/even hiking. Our feet were happy. It was just the last mile where we got a little frazzled.Us, and many of the others listed above, could be heard during that last mile swearing the shelter should be just around the corner. It seemed like it just stretched on and on.Oh, and i forgot to mention, we hiked through a torrential downpour and some thunder and lightning. We are sitting in our tent right now trying to warm our bodies up, and desperately hoping our clothes dry out.Rumour has it tonight will be very cold. Heres hoping there is sun tomorrow. Will try and update this space in 2 or 3 days from now. Thank you to everyone who has signed our guestbook, we love you all.","Hawk Mountain Campsite
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 19, Mon",8.50
Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584580,"We woke up today, fully soaked from the thunder and lightning storm that we slept through last night.Our clothes had yet to dry from the previous day, and our tent fly had let in some rain during the night.We were the first out of camp this morning, brightand early at 7:45am. We were originally planning on an 8 mile day to lance's creek, but we were going fast and met two other hikers intending to stay at woods hole shelter. So we decided to push our limits and go for a 12 mile day.And let me tell you, our limits were pushed. We were very tires by mile 10, but our desire to get to the shelter grew when we heard that it was supposed to snow at night. We arrived at the shelter around 2pm, a little frustrated since we had to hike an additionally half mile off trail just to reach it. We cooked dinner, set up our sleeping bags and other things, and by 5pm the shelter was full and the weather was hell bent on not letting us sleep.That was one of the worst nights I have experiences both physically and mentally. It was snowing, and no matter how many layers I threw on, I was cold. Lionheart and I probably only got a couple hours of sleep between us.Last night was also very tough for me mentally. During the 12 hours I got to lay on the cold waiting for 7am, I had a lot of time to think. I miss home, I miss cooking pizza together with lionheart, I miss snuggling up on a warm couch and talking.It was just one of those nights you remember that you are out here willingly. Willingly choosing to be cold, wet, and hungry. But we go on.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584584,"After last night's ""sleep"", Lionheart and I set out around 7:30am while it was still snowing.We had already decided that we were going to stay in the hostel at Mountain Crossings Outfitters in Neels Gap.We both felt like we needed a rest day for our muscles after yesterday, but more importantly a day out of the cold for our minds.I am currently sat here at 3:35pm, on a bunk bed, having just split a warm pizza with Lionheart. It has been wonderful for both body and spirit, and the hostel is full of hikers who feel the same.We have been planning out our next few days. The weather looks like it will be sunny for 2 days, and then rain for 3. We picked up our food resupply we had sent here ahead of time.We are planning on going about 64 miles in the next 5 days, hoping by day 10 to be at Standing Indian Shelter. This means that we will be doing double the amount of miles in the next 5 days compared to the last 5.Physically we are both doing really well. We can feel ourselves getting stronger and faster. Mentally Lionheart is doing awesome, Im struggling a little bit, but I knew I would be.I think once all of this snow nonsense is done in a month or so, things will be a lot better. I can deal with being wet, but last night was pretty bad.Lionheart is napping, Im about to wake her up and we are going to go through our resupply. I will update hopefully again in 3 or 5 days. Thank you all for the kind messages and prayers, they do not go unnoticed.","Woods Hole Shelter

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585176,"Beth and I had made a habit by this point of being the first out of camp every morning. This morning was no exception, as we were the first hikers out of the hostel and into the very cold morning air.
The ground was still covered with a thin layer of snow, and it must have been in the 20s or 30s. But the worst thing was the stinging wind, and it was blowing fierce. Beth and I kept joking back and forth a line from a tv show that says ""why do we live in a place where the air hurts our face"". 
But we go on. We felt super fresh fro. the good nights sleep, and had our eyes set on a 14 mile day to a campsite just past the first shelter we would come across. We started off, and we did not see anyone for a while.
We got to our first vantage point and ran into Jurgen and Tinkerbell, two very awesome German hikers who had met at the airport. We had already met Jurgen two days ago, but this was our first time meeting Tinkerbell.
We ended up pretty much doing a hiker relay race with these two for the first 10 miles or so. They would pass us, take a break, we would pass them, take a break, repeat over and over again.One super awesome thing is that around mile 5.5, Beth and I experienced our first trail magic! Two men from a local church, I am so sorry I am blanking on the name, were at a Gap and had a table set up with coffee, hot chocolate, and tons of sugary snacks. We arrived pretty much at the same time as Jurgen and Tinkerbell, and the four of us enjoyed honeybuns, warm drink, and the southern delicacies ""moonpies"". Beth and I were so thankful, and at that time did not know how much we would need that boost for what lay ahead.
We stopped at the shelter at the 12 mile mark, I think it waa low gap shelter, for lunch. There we ran into some familiar faces: Flyballs and Franklinstein, Juliedoll, Jurgen and Tinkerbell, and we also met sunshine for the first time. She is the sweetest person ever.
After lunch, we knew we had about two miles to go, so we packed up and set off. Except there was an issue. The guidebook said that our campsite was off the trail and unmarked.
We ended up walking right past it. We were hopeful we would run into it, until we realized we had gone 15 miles total and there was no hope of finding it. We stopped for water and Jurgen and Tinkerbell caught up to us.
Turns out they had missed it too. We had 2 options, backtrack a mile and try to find it, or hike out the rest of the 5 miles to the next shelter. At this point, you know what we did.
The first 3.5 miles were actually pretty steady terrain, and beth and I were going faster because now we were leading the two German hikers as well, because they wanted to stay as a group in case the 4 of us missed the shelter somehow.
But man, that last 1.5 mile stretch was awful. We were all tired, pushed to our limits, and it was the biggest elevation climb of the day. On top of that it was super rocky terrain, with basketball sized boulders jutting out at all angles.
We finally made it to camp, much to the surprise of many of the hikers who we had known would be there, and laughed at the events of the day. We were exhausted, our feet hurt, but we still needed to set up camp, cook dinner, and walk .2 miles back the way we came to filter water from the worst water source known to man.
Beth and I snuggled into our sleeping bags, and prepared for the super cold night ahead.","Neels Gap

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585177,"Beth and I were again the first out of camp, but I would be lying if I told you we were feeling good.The 20 mile day had shaken our bodies pretty badly. We had two big climbs and descents ahead of us today, and our bodies were not shy about reminding us of the various aches and pains we had accumulated to this point.In particular, two major things were hurting me. The first was my shins were on fire. I have struggled with shin splints since Freshman year of highschool and they are a recurring issue.The second and more concerning issue was my right knee. I tore my ACL, MCL, LCL, Meniscus and Cartiledge in one fell swoop 6 years ago, ans by the end of the day my knee was screaming at me.The day was largely uneventful, we got to camp around 2pm, and were reunited with a couple familiar faces. Sam and Joe, two friends from MA who we had met earlier, were at the shelter as well.We kind of just hung out, and by 4 the shelter was full with familiar and new faces. Sam, Joe, Hue, Teehan, Soup, Blaze, LJ, and Patches, who was from NH.We all hung out, playing a game called contact,  which is super fun by the way. We all turned in at about 7pm, and some slept well, while the rest of us listened to the snores of those who were sleeping well.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585181,"Everyone at camp had heard the weather report, the next 4 days was going to be 3 days of rain with a possible day of snow. We had all expected to wake up with it raining, but when 7am came around and Beth and I walked out of camp, there was no rain surprisingly.We didnt know how far we wanted to go today. We were both still feeling exhausted from the 20 mile day, and we decided just to see where the day took us.We were about 7 miles in to the day when my body basically shut down. I remember it pretty clearly. We had been going up and down all day, and during one of the uphills my body just stopped working.I had been in a sourish mood all day so far, I was feeling sick and light headed, and i was starting to feel the effect of not getting a good nights sleep. Every day on our journey so far, I had been able to get less than 4 hours of sleep a night, and last night it was more like 2 hours.My body was telling me I needed a good sleep, and Beth didnt mind finding a room in town for the night considering the forecast. We ran into Patches, and the three of us agreed to split a room in town.With that plan in mind, we hiked the last 4 miles to Dicks Creek Gap, where a main road runs right into Hiawassee GA 11.0 miles West. The plan was to hitchhike into town, since none of us wanted to pay to get a taxi.We began walking with our thumbs up, and about a half mile down a super nice woman in a white pick up truck picked us up. She brought us all the way to Hiawassee, and wished us goodluck.And boy did we have some good luck....There was a big concert in town, so pretty much every room was booked except for one place. The mull's inn. Those of you who have read ""A walk in the woods"" will remember this name, and trust me, it lives up to every expectation.It was the most run down, ratty, disgusting, and overpriced place any of us had stayed at. The owner had quoted me a price of $60 over the phone, but once we actually showed up she changed it to $75. We couldn't do anything because every other hotel was booked full, and we had no way of getting back to the trail. We paid the money, got our room key, and spent the next hour running back and forth between our room and her office because our room didnt have things like towels, bed sheets, etc.But it was dry, warmish, and out of the rain. We went to dinner at this amazing burger joint called Barneys, and there were about 30 hikers in the dining room by the time we finished. It felt like we were a trail family.Oh and the best burgers ever by the way.We walked home, full and dry, and decided to hit the hay.This'll be my last update for a bit, so don't be concerned if you don't see updates for a week or so!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Braveheart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585637,"It is with a bittersweet taste in my mouth that I must tell you all that Beth and I have had to forego our exciting and amazing adventure on the Appalachian Trail.Increasingly over the past few days of our hike, my bad knee had continued to hurt more and more. A moderate pain I can deal with, but this got to the point where I was having great trouble walking. It had become pretty swollen and no amount of ibuprofen was bringing the pain down. The day after we stayed at the Mull's Inn, Beth (Lionheart) and I talked about our options, and we chose to give it a day. The next day, my knee was just as bad as the day before, if not more stiff. After a couple hour discussion, we both made the decision together to end our journey. However, both Beth and I are very at peace with the decision. We had known that there was a possibility of failure when we began our journey, but we chose to pursue our dreams and aspirations anyway. For that, I am so proud of us. Many people would choose not to pursue something they think they want because of fear of failure, and instead we chose to do it anyway. And neither of us would trade the experiences we had for the world. We were only on the trail for about 10 days, but the experiences we both encountered were amazing. We loved the feeling of pushing our bodies to the limit, of sleeping in the outdoors, of meeting new and interesting people every day. We absolutely loved the trail life. We also, in our limited time, experienced so many new things. We hitchhiked for the first time, slept through freezing temperatures in a shelter full of strangers and 2 potential mass murderers who had claimed half the shelter with pee bottles, trash, and talk of ecstasy, we camped in crazily high winds and through lightning and thunder storms, we hiked through those same storms, we stayed in an amazing hostel and at the same time stayed in the worst hotel of our lives, we camped on tops of mountains and watched the beautiful night sky until we fell asleep, we met many amazing people all with unique and interesting stories, we answered nature's call in the woods, we smelled the worst we have ever smelled and got used to it, we hiked the longest mileage each of us has ever done in a day, we used bear bags for the first time and learned how to use bear cabling systems, and the best part about all of this is that we truly enjoyed every second of our journey together. So yes, it is sad and hard to tell you all that we are stopping, but we are so happy that we decided to start the Appalachian Trail. Beth and I are home in MA, after spending a week in North Carolina, and we are so excited to do so many things. We are excited that we have a whole 6-months that we did not have before. We are planning shorter hiking trips in about a month or so, overnight camping on the weekends, and we are so excited to get back into being involved in our community and volunteering in the area. Thank each and everyone of you who have been reading this blog and sending us encouraging messages. We hope that everyone can understand, and we hope everyone understands that both of us are at peace with this outcome. We know that some people may think we wasted our time, or that we were foolish to set off on this quest, but all I can tell you is that Beth and I are never afraid to pursue something for fear of failure, and we wouldn't do anything differently even if we could.Thanks again everyone, and if you enjoyed following our short but amazing journey, I encourage you all to follow other hikers on this site. Every hiker we met has been nothing but amazing, and they all deserve support. Thanks, and God Bless.","
