Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517043,"I am a happy person w/ no regrets up to this point in my life. I would not change one decision in my 61+ years that led me to today. I had a great childhood and family life w/ supportive, loving parents and 4 close siblings. I am happy w/the decisions that led to my education and what schools I went to. I am happy w/ my chosen profession (Family Physician), where I chose to set up practice, who I chose to practice and work with, the wonderful patients I have had the pleasure/honor to advise/teach and treat.I have been happily married to my loving wife for 36+ years and have 3 grown sons who I am extremely proud of, 2 great daughter-in-laws, and 4 terrific, happy and healthy grandchildren.
Now why and when another attempt at a thru hike. I attempted an AT thru-hike last year and learned a lot - what I am capable of and what it takes. I did hike 554 miles and truly enjoyed the experience. 
1-WHY?????Last years hike only made my ""White Blaze Fever"" stronger than ever. I think and dream about being back on the trail almost every day. But why, in this day and age w/ all the ""luxuries"" available to me at this point in my life, would I want to undertake such a seemingly strenuous and anything but luxurious journey?I think the answer has to do w/ my life up to now - I have been a physician/caregiver, husband, father, grandfather. I went thru an extensive education process, then practiced my profession for long hours for the last 33+ years. Medicine w/ the increasing regulations and electronic health records has become more and more demanding. I still very much enjoy the face to face time w/ my patients, but find these other demands more and more daunting. I am tiring of that. I want to have a period in my life where my concerns are more elemental. I want my worries to consist of food, water, and shelter, rather than documentation and certification guidelines, meeting government and insurance regulations, work deadlines, and other things that really are of little significance when you sit back and put your life in perspective. This journey is an escape as well as a physical and, more importantly, mental challenge.
2-WHEN?????I have always read that it is generally possible for an otherwise healthy person to thru hike before age 70 - that after that age your body frequently does not recover quickly enough to allow you to hike the entire AT in 1 year. I know that is not ALWAYS true, but I know my body recovers more slowly now.I have some remaining responsibilities to transition my office/ practice to function w/out my presence and have advised my patients I will not retire until the end of 2017. If I start my hike in early 2018 then I will turn 65 while hiking. So that is my plan - to start my hike around the end of February, 2018.",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Sun",0

I appreciate reading the journal entries of others, so I should try better with my journal. 468 days to retirement, 526 +/- days until I start my AT thru-hike (plan on starting near end of February). I think about hiking every day, read the journals of those hiking and finishing their thru-hikes, read gear reviews, etc. Trying to work thru a bilateral Achilles tendinitis now - glad it started this far ahead of my hike.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550783,"I will be retiring the end of 2017 after more than a third of a century seeing patients as a Family Physician in my own practice. I did take a leave of absence in 2014 for my 1st attempt at a thru-hike - completed 554 miles from Springer Mountain to about 10 miles north of Atkins, VA. That hike was interrupted by an injury, then was unable to complete the thru-hike due to work obligations/ time constraints. This time no schedule or deadline. Currently I plan to start early - some time in the 2nd half of February/2018 (started 3/1/14 last time). I learned a lot on my 2014 hike - loved life on the trail and being a part of the amazing trail community.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552717,"1-As of now I am considering a start date of 2/21/18 +/- 4 days (2/17 to 2/25/18). Last time, when I hiked in 2014, I started on Saturday, 3/1 and ran into a good number of other hikers starting that early. At the 1st few shelters I stayed at there were as many as 3 dozen hikers either in the shelter or in tents or hammocks around them. I have noticed that there are more hikers starting earlier each year and that weekend start dates are more crowded. So starting around Wednesday, 2/21/18 may help get me a little ahead of the March starters (they likely will bunch up starting Saturday, 3/3/18 - Sunday, 3/4/18). And a mid week start will separate me a little for the 1st week from the weekend bubbles. By the time I hit the GA/NC border our daily hiking distance differences will balance out the ""crowds"". Don't get me wrong - I am not antisocial or a loner, but I would prefer 4-12 hikers at a shelter/ campsite rather than 24-36 hikers.As far as the weather is concerned, I know that starting that early requires flexibility and do not expect to take any unnecessary risks - if temps are expected to drop too low (certainly into single digits and possibly <20), I will be prepared to stay in a Hospice or in town for a couple days or more at a time until weather improves. After all, I do want to have fun.2-I appreciate Gorp Gobblers invite to a Shake Down/Conditioning Group Hike from 4/1-4/9/17. At the current time I don't think I can make that due to work commitment.3-Finally, on a separate note, for my fellow class of 2018 and anyone else interested who is on Facebook, I did start a public Facebook group ""Appalachian Trail Class of 2018"".

Earlier in March I was having a conversation with our middle son (age 33) and he mentioned that he wants to take a sabbatical from his work (very stressful/ high pressure position) and join me for up to 3 months on the trail. He had mentioned this idea back in January, 2016, after an especially stressful week at work, but he then did not mention it again until a few weeks ago. He has been w/ his company long enough that he qualifies to take up to 3 months off (w/out pay). I feel honored that he wants to join me and spend this time on the trail w/ me.We have 3 sons - oldest is almost 36, married, lives in Atlanta, has 2 sons - ages 2-1/2 yo and 5 months old. 2nd is 33, married, lives in southern LA area (Redondo Beach) has 3 children - 8-1/2 yo girl, almost 6 yo girl, and 3-3/4 yo son. Youngest son is 29, lives in Pittsburgh, engaged to be married 7/2/17. On my 2014 attempted thru-hike it was this youngest son who joined me on the trail for 10 days/ about 114 miles.   We are proud of all 3 of our sons and their spouses (or soon to be spouse) they are all very bright and successful and a joy to be around. They have all asked us to eventually move closer to them. Time will tell, but my mom (soon to be 92) is still alive and lives independently near us, so we won't be moving too soon. But we do travel a lot to see the kids and grandchildren.As for me, I am working on losing weight and getting in shape. I finished my 2014 hike at 190# - had gained to 249# as of January/2017. As of this AM, weight is down to 233# - goal to drop to 220# by 7/1/17 (for my son's wedding) and then continue to lose weight AND get in shape.

I continue to try to get in better shape and lose more of my excess weight - seem stuck right now between 230 and 235#.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576794,"Here it is Labor Day weekend and I have less than 4 months to retirement and 168 days to the start of my hike. 
I have reserved a timeshare unit in Helen, Georgia for the week starting 2/17/18.  The plan is to check in there on Saturday, 2/17/18 with my wife, then have her drive me to Springer Mountain the morning of 2/18/18.  If my plans work out as I hope, I will slack-pack for most of that week - my wife will drop me off in the morning and pick me up in the evening each day, 8-12 miles up the trail where possible.  I have been looking at road crossings/ parking areas in the first 60-70 miles of the trail, and there may be one section that will require me to overnight 1 night on the trail.  The other nights that week I plan on returning to the timeshare for time each evening with my wife and a warm dinner and warm bed. Those days I should be able to carry a 12-15# pack instead of a 35 +/- # pack.  
From my 2014 hike (started 3/1/14) I know that 1st week was tough.  After the 1st 32 miles over the 1st 4 days I took a zero at Neels Gap/ Blood Mountain Cabins and felt whipped and ready to quit.  After taking that zero and doing much self reflection, I decided to push on and found myself starting to get my trail legs about the time I crossed the GA/ NC border.  I was then increasing my miles to 12-16 miles/day (until I injured my L calf/ Achilles on 3/15/14).  The ups and downs of the northern GA mountains will still be there and will challenge me, but I will hopefully be carrying 20# less weight and I hope that carrying less weight that 1st week will better allow me to get my trail legs.  Yes, I do plan to continue to work on getting in shape, especially utilizing my incline treadmill (Nordic Track Teton w/ max incline of 50 degrees).  But for me and my schedule, I know nothing can fully prepare me for hiking over mountains 8-12 hrs/day, every day, until I actually start.
Starting that early in the year has its own challenges.  The days are shorter and when the sun goes down in the northern GA mountains it can get quite cold.  On my 2014 hike I frequently would be in my sleeping bag in my tent (to keep warm) by 7-8 PM.  As is often said, when it gets dark it's ""hiker midnight"".  Going back to the timeshare will help me with this the 1st week.  On 2/18 sunrise will be about 7:15 AM, sunset about 6:22 PM.  Sunset will progress about 1 minute later each day thru 3/10 when it will be about 6:39 PM, then Daylight Savings Time kicks in on 3/11 and full darkness won't occur until 8 PM.  I remember in 2014 enjoying that extra hour of daylight in the evening once Daylight Savings Time started.",,View Entry,"Sep 02, Sat",0
Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580443,"Here it is, less than 2 weeks until Thanksgiving.  After a record warm month of October here in the Northeast, the weather has turned suddenly cold w/ record or near record lows for last night and tonight.  I started my 2014 hike on March 1st and had some cold nights then in northern Georgia and into North Carolina and Tennessee.  During the nights we did have some freezing rain and a little snow the 1st half of March.  I spent a zero in Franklin, NC on 3/13/14 when the temps were supposed to drop down to single digits in the mountains.  Due to an Achilles injury, I took 5 weeks off (starting 3/23/14) at home to recover and returned to Fontana Dam, NC on 4/22/14, then hiked north thru the Smokies starting 4/23/14.  The weather by then had become much more spring-like.  My friends who continued their hike into the Smokies in mid March/2014 hit a lot of snow and winter weather.
So why am I starting my thru-hike even earlier in 2018?  I prefer to spend some time early on winter hiking and camping so I can be farther north when the heat arrives.  I will be retired and if weather dictates, for safety reasons, to stay at a hostel or hotel, then I will have no problems doing that.  
I am even planning on slack-packing (8-12+ miles/ day) most or all of my 1st week on the trail - 1-to try to improve my endurance and get my trail legs while carrying only 10-15# in my pack, 2-to avoid most or all of those cold nights on the trail the 1st week.  I discussed these plans in my last entry.  The unknown in the plan will be the weather and how it affects road access to the parking areas along the trail.  Regardless, after that 1st week I will be working my way north along w/ the rest of our NOBO Class of 2018.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581104,"Last time I tried a thru hike was in 2014, starting 3/1/14 on Springer Mountain. When I crossed from Georgia into North Carolina, I spent the next 3 nights at Muskrat Creek Shelter (on 3/10/14), Carter Gap Shelter (on 3/11/14), and Rock Gap Shelter (on 3/12/14). Met several other hikers at those shelters including Bismarck (and his companion Hopper), in picture above from my complete photo journal. For those of you who aren't familiar w/ Bismarck, you can Google ""Appalachian Trail hiker Bismarck"" and read his story -https://www.sbnation.com/longform/2015/7/1/8861183/james-hammes-appalachian-trail-bismarck. On the trail we go by our trail names and know little else about each other at times. After my 2014 experience, I sometimes think that after a fellow hiker introduces him or herself only by their trail name, in the back of my mind I may at times be thinking ""so what's your real story?"" 
BTW - Bismarck was 1 of the friendliest, most experienced, and most helpful hikers I met early in my hike.

This morning we drove from Atlanta to Amicalola Falls State Park/ Visitor Center and I signed the NOBO-THRU HIKERS REGISTRATION as hiker #157.  After a short visit there and talk with the park rangers, I decided that I will take a shuttle from the visitor center to Springer Mountain parking lot tomorrow morning.  With all the rain lately, Forest Service Road #42 is not in the best shape.  We drove my wife's new Mini-cooper here and I doubt it would make it - they suggested not trying w/out a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  We are checked into a timeshare named the Loreley Resort in Helen, Georgia for the week.  Tomorrow morning we will leave here at 7 AM to drive the 1 hour to the Amicalola Visitor Center and meet my shuttle at 8 AM.  I should be on Springer Mountain by about 9:30 AM.
I am all packed, but will be doing a combination of overnight and daytrips/slackpacking this week and the forecast is for mild weather, so my pack is light - only 25-28# for the overnighters, maybe 15# for the daytrips.  Tentative schedule to start is: 
1-2/18-2/19- Springer Mountain to Woody Gap intersection w/ GA 60 (mile 20.8) - overnight trip
2-2/19- Woody Gap to Neels Gap intersection w/ US 19 (mile 31.7) - daytrip
3-2/20- Neels Gap to Hogpen Gap intersection w/GA 348 (mile 38.6) - daytrip
4-2/21 (or 2/21-2/22)- Hogpen Gap to Unicoi Gap intersection w/ GA 75 (mile 52.9) - probably daytrip/ possibly overnight trip

5-2/22-2/23 (or 2/24-2/25)- Unicoi Gap to Dicks Creek Gap/intersection w/ US 76 (mile 69.6) - overnight trip.

Staying in room w/ 6 bunks, on a bottom bunk. Again I will wear earplugs.Took 1 PM shuttle ride from hostel to Hiawassee and ate 12"" BLT sub at Subway w/ glass of sweetened tea, then walked about 1/2 mile to Ingles Supermarket and bought 4 oranges, 2 ears of corn, and small bottle of hand sanitizer. Now waiting outside Ingles for 4:20 PM shuttle back to hostel.  Been hiking w/ another hiker  (Rick ""Gaddabout"") for last 2 days (not hiking together during the day, but staying at shelters together). We are both at hostel in same bunk room. We tried to get a 2 bed cottage there together, but they were already booked. Rick went to Mexican restaurant while I went to Subway. Now he is inside Ingles doing some shopping. Plan on doing a zero tomorrow - weather forecast is for 90% chance of showers/ rain/ thunderstorms for next 2 days (Wed and Thur), then 3 days of sun/ dry.  If I hike Thursday and get wet, I will have next 3 days to dry out. Taking nero today and zero tomorrow should help muscles heal up. Tentative schedule starting Thursday has me increasing my miles to average 10-13 miles/ day - up from 8-10 miles/ day for last few days (except for nero today). 
Some definitions and explanations - 
1- “Nero” - A nero is a near zero.  By staying at a campsite or shelter near a hostel or town (for me less than about 5 miles), you can hike to the town or hostel in 2-3 hrs and enjoy almost the whole day as rest/ down time.  If you were to continue hiking the day before into the town or hostel, you might arrive at 7 PM or later, and check-out is usually at 10 AM, so that does not leave much time. In that case, you might stay 2 nights vs the nero usually being 1 night.
2- “Zero” - A zero is the day between the 2 night stay at a shelter, hostel, hotel, etc.  Therefore, zero miles hiked on a “zero”.15,811 steps today.  One step at a time.","Deep Gap Shelter

In this case weather is causing a change of plans - current forecast is 100% chance of rain for Wed (today) and Thur w/ possible flooding.  I had already booked to stay here again tonight before going to bed last evening. I checked the local/ trail weather forecast this morning and the weather forecast for today is showers this morning w/ heavier rain after 1 PM (possible 1-2” rain thru this evening) then ongoing rain tonight and tomorrow w/ another 1-2” rain tonight and another 1-2” rain tomorrow).  This AM I booked and paid for my bunk for Thursday night too - that will be 3 nights here.  Not planned, but better safe than sorry.
Nice to be retired, but I would still like to get moving.  Oh well, you can’t control the weather.
Yesterday, after returning from town, I relaxed in the common area here at the hostel.  That area closes at 7 PM and I returned to the bunkhouse/ hostel.  It has a kitchen and table/ chairs.  I microwaved and ate my 2 ears of corn, then scrambled 3 eggs and ate them on a soft tortilla (the eggs and soft tortilla had been left by previous hikers in the refrigerator and were marked “free” - this happens at all hostels. Hikers don’t like to carry excess weight, so they leave extra food bought in “hiker boxes”, free to other hikers).  Then I ate 2 chocolate chip cookies I had brought back from my lunch at Subway.  I think I have my appetite back.  I laid down and went to sleep about 10 PM.
This morning I woke up at 6 AM.  The common area opens at 7 AM and they have all you can eat cereal and free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate - all included for $30/ night rate.  I had Cheerios and a cup of tea for breakfast.  Now at 10 AM I am sitting on couch in common area catching up on my journal.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583486,"Here at TOG hostel for 2nd zero, waiting out the weather.  We originally had 16 hikers in the bunkhouse last night, 1 had his daughter come from Chattanooga (2-1/2 hrs each way) to pick him up for couple days. That left 15 hikers there overnight.  After breakfast they had shuttles back to the trail at 9 and 10 AM, 1/3 of the hikers returned to the trail.  10 of us are still at the hostel doing zero today.
2 reasons for doing these zeros - 
1 - Hiking up and down these mountains and hills after this much rain gets slick and muddy.  It is easy to fall repeatedly and injure yourself - twist an ankle or knee or worse.  That could end my hike. 
2 - Hiking the whole AT is 90% mental/ psychological/ attitude.  Getting yourself and all your gear soaking wet and cold, especially this early in a hike, can cause you to lose that desire and quit.

Yesterday I went into town on 4 PM shuttle w/ 5 other hikers - Rick “Gaddabout”, Wise Man, Mac Daddy, Maple (19 yo from Vermont), and Rolly-Poley (another young hiker).  5 of us (all but Rolly Poley (about 20 yo from Kentucky) who had to go to Post Office to pick up a new backpack he had mailed to him) went to an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) buffet at Daniel’s Steak House.  We then all met at the Ingles Supermarket, shopped and bought what we needed, then got picked up by the shuttle outside Ingles at about 6:15 PM, returning to TOG hostel about 6:45.  I relaxed for a couple hrs in the bunkhouse and then hit my bunk, relaxed another hour listening to an audiobook before going to sleep at 10.
Woke today at 5:50 AM after pretty good sleep, came over to common area and had Cheerios and cup of hot tea at 7:15, then took shower and gave the staff my laundry to wash ($5 for small load) - I had been wearing same clothes (my dry/ “town” clothes) last 2 days.  Not sure when my next chance will be.  
Now relaxing in large common room (again open for hikers to use from 7 AM to 7 PM) here at TOG.  Bought 3 bagels, cream cheese, thinly sliced ham yesterday to make sandwiches for lunch/ dinner.  Not planning to go back into Hiawassee today.

The trail was initially crusted and frozen on the surface, causing a crunching w/ each step.  There were also feathery ice crystals visible along the side of the trail in places.  Goal is 12.5 miles to Carter Gap Shelter.  That is where most of the hikers who stayed at Muskrat Creek Shelter are headed for tonight.
6 PM - Got to Carter Gap Shelter about 5 PM after climbing over couple smaller ascents of 200 and 400 ft early, then 1100+ ascent over 2.5 miles up and over Standing Indian Mountain midway thru the hike, then another 500 ft ascent over 1 mile just before arriving at the shelter. Weather was sunny and pleasant w/ high of about 55.  Not really any open views to get photos from but good views of surrounding mountains thru the trees.
More than a dozen hikers here, most same as last night.  5-6 in shelter, another 8 or more in tents and hammocks.

I started hiking at about 8 and had planned destination of Rock Gap Shelter, 12.1 miles away - with tough Albert Mountain midway thru the hike.  Weather again was sunny w/ high of 50-55, nice visibility (see pictures).  Had initial 300+ ft up and down, then about 11 started climb up Albert Mt.  1st 500 ft was fairly easy at moderate grade, then hit extremely steep section that ascends about 500 ft over 0.3 miles - almost rock climbing (w/ 35# backpack on) at times.  Rewarded at top (reached it about 1 PM) w/ beautiful views and fire tower also at top.  Took 20 minute break (8-10 other hikers also there taking snack/ lunch break and well deserved rest), then started hiking on.  Next milestone was 100 mile mark 1/2 mile later.  Still had 5 to 5-1/2 miles to hike.  Got into a nice pace and reached Rock Gap Shelter about 5.  Again tenting sites were limited, but Rick had set up his tent on this 1 tent “pad” so I could set my tent up next to his tent (back to back).  After I set up my tent, sleeping pad and bag, I cooked and ate dinner (sweet and sour pork Mountain House dinner). 
Now laying in sleeping bag to stay warm.  Supposed to go down to about 34 tonight.  In kind of a bubble of hikers - most were at hostel and at same shelters as me for now 3 nights in a row.

Did speak to 2 of the other hikers in the group that are getting off the trail in Franklin.  Water Leaf, a 34 yo who has been planning this hike for 3 years and has been doing a You Tube video log, says he has had it and just does not enjoy climbing mountains.  He plans on renting a car and driving home.  And Marbles, a 50ish year old (previously Navy man), has a pain in 1 foot every time he steps down on it.  His wife is meeting him in Franklin and taking him to a doctor - he is afraid he has a stress fracture in his foot.  If so, that would end his hike.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583656,"Woke up at 5:30 AM after broken night sleep.  Only few tent sites available at Rock Gap Shelter and my tent probably at at least 10% grade from the foot to the head.  Better than side to side grade I had 2 nights ago, but my sleeping pad and bag kept sliding to the foot end of my tent where some condensation forms on that side of the tent. At times during the night I also could not fully straighten out my legs, so I would then pull my sleeping bag down some, then slide pad and bag back up toward the head end of my tent.  Needless to say, not a real restful night.  Of course I also had planned a nero into Franklin and had made reservations at a hostel. 
Anyways, about 5:45 AM I began to pack up - while still in my tent and maybe 10 degrees warmer than the 25-26 degrees outside, I stuffed my sleeping bag into its stuff sack, deflated and rolled up my sleeping pad, then brought all my gear down about 20 ft to the shelter’s picnic table.  Of course during this time perhaps half of the 16 or so hikers there (5 in the shelter and the rest in tents and hammocks) were awake and also packing up their gear (all quietly so as not to disturb still sleeping hikers).  I then prepared and drank another Carnation instant breakfast, used the privie, then started hiking about 7:30 AM. 
I was only hiking 3.8 miles today, up and over a 650 ft “hill”.  It was still sunny, probably 30 when I started hiking and warming to about 45-50 by mid morning. I reached Winding Stair Gap at 10 AM, joining several other of the hikers already there and waiting for the shuttle.  More continued to arrive and when the shuttle did arrive, l think 16-20 of us boarded.  This was a free shuttle provided by Ron Haven and he took us to his hostel - those that weren’t staying at his hostel still were not charged for the >10 mile ride.
On arriving at Ron’s Baltimore Jack’s Place Hostel, he showed Rick “Gaddabout” and myself to the double room I had called ahead to reserve (while on top of Albert Mountain the day before).  It has a bedroom w/ 2 Queen beds, separate living area w/ couple lounge chairs, small kitchen table and 2 chairs, refrigerator, microwave and private bathroom w/ shower.  For $40 for the 2 of us/ night, better than staying in the hostel bunk room for $20/person/night.  We are staying here for 2 nights (due to weather), so doing nero and a zero.
After being shown our room, I took my shower and then Rick took his, I threw our laundry in the washer (coin operated - $2 wash and $2 dry), then we unpacked and hung up gear (e.g., our sleeping bags) to dry. 
About 1:30 PM we took short walk to gas station/ convenience store nearby (~1/4 mile) and each bought chips and cold drinks, then returned to hostel and relaxed and ate/ drank our snacks.
Finally at 4, Ron shuttled us and 3 other hikers to a Walmart and a AYCE Chinese buffet - was pretty good and even had some decent Sushi. At Walmart’s I bought a few things for breakfast and lunch tomorrow and just couple things to complete my hiking food supplies.  Got shuttle ride back at 5:30.  Since then, been working on my trail journal - will get caught up w/ entries and photos tomorrow.
Interesting hiker by the trail name “Footprint” I met and talked to on the shuttle trip to Walmart’s.  He is from the former Czech Republic and is here on a 6 month visa to hike the AT.  He is 34 and already hiked the PCT and CDT in last few years.  When he completes the AT he will have completed his “Triple Crown”.  He has his own business and has a wife and 9 month old baby at home (Czech).  He is trying to hike the AT in 3 months and so far has averaged 20 miles/day.

Lonnie (the hostel owner) first drove Swagman to Stecoah Gap for his hike to Fontana Dam at 7:50, then came back and picked me up about 15 min later and drove me back to the NOC.  On arriving at the NOC at 8:30 AM, I immediately took my pack and hiking poles out of Lonnie’s car and started hiking.  The hike started at an altitude of 1727 feet and immediately climbed to 4710 feet at Swim Bald over a distance of 6 miles. I only saw a couple young thru-hikers who passed me over this section. 
At 1 PM I reached Sassafras Gap Shelter at an elevation of 4391 feet and ran into another hiker I knew, named Mac Daddy (I had had lunch w/ him and 2 other hikers the day before).  I told him of my plans and that I was staying at the hostel and he decided to join me.  We hiked together for most of the rest of the day.
From Sassafras Gap Shelter we had another climb to the top of Cheoah Bald at 5062 feet and 8.1 miles into the hike.  Normally there are great views from Cheoah Bald, but we were enveloped in a low cloud and only had about a 20 ft visibility.  We hiked on from there over a couple smaller hills and generally downhill until we reached our destination of Stecoah Gap at 3165 ft, 13.6 miles total hike.  2/10 mile before reaching Stecoah Gap, I had called Lonnie and he pulled up w/ his car just as we exited the woods at 5:30 PM, then a quick 5 minute drive back to the hostel.
Weather today was cloudy w/ temps 40-45 and misty showers on and off thru-out the day.  I used my hiking umbrella when I started my hike out of NOC until about 3000 ft elevation, then switched to my rain jacket because it was getting colder (because of the higher elevation).  
After returning to the hostel I took a hot shower, laundered my clothes I had worn, then about 7 PM walked up to the diner w/ Mac Daddy and Chip (another thru-hiker, age 55, who has been hiking in our “bubble” and had arrived at the hostel earlier in the afternoon).  We had the dinner special - glazed pork loin w/ 2 sides and I had sweetened iced tea again.  While we were waiting for our food, Swagman walked in and joined us - he had ordered a burger and fries take-out, but sat down w/ us and ate it there.  A very pleasant and satisfying dinner w/ new friends.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583945,"Woke up at 7:30 AM after decent night sleep. Had arranged w/ Lonnie (hostel owner) for ride back to Stecoah Gap at 8:30 AM.  He was at the hostel a few minutes early (he doesn’t like to make hikers wait), we drove back to Stecoah Gap, took picture of Mac Daddy and me at the Gap, then he and I started our hike at 9 AM.  Again we were slackpacking w/ 10-12# packs. We hiked about 1 mile, then hit a notoriously steep section of the trail called Jacob’s Ladder - an elevation rise of 500+ feet in 6/10 of a mile.  Once completed, the rest of today’s hike was generally easy.  Temp was 45-50, cloudy and foggy (or low clouds) w/ very little visibility - down to 20-25 ft at times.  Mac Daddy and I hiked more or less together the whole hike today and reached Yellow Creek Road at 2 PM.  Lonnie had left a car for us at the parking area there, we loaded in our packs and hiking poles, then I drove (10 minutes) back to the hostel.  Then showered, washed clothes, went to diner next door for early dinner at about 3:30 PM.  Had dinner w/ Mac Daddy and Swagman (who zeroed today after hiking from Stecoah Gap to Fontana Dam Shelter yesterday).  I had a club sandwich and sweet iced tea.  
It is now 7 PM and I am at the hostel relaxing and updating my journal.  Tomorrow the plan is for ""Shadow"" (the hostel caretaker) to drive us back to Yellow Creek Gap/ Rd at 8 AM, then we (Mac Daddy and me) will hike from there to Fontana Dam (about 7.5 miles - again rain is forecast).  Lonnie has again arranged to leave a car for us there to get back to the hostel Monday evening.  While in Fontana Dam, I will pick up my resupply package at the post office and Mac Daddy will pick his up at the Lodge/ resort motel.  We will return for our last night at the hostel Monday night, pack up our full packs, and either Lonnie or Shadow will drive us back to Fontana Dam on Tuesday morning to start our hike into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park - plan on 12+ mile hike starting at Fontana Dam Visitor Center at 1700 ft elevation to Mollies Ridge Shelter at 4585 ft elevation.  In the Smokies, we have to stay at the shelters - no camping/ tenting in between.  The Smokies go from mile 167.1 to mile 238.7.
So why have I been staying at Hostel and slackpacking-1-weather w/ significant rain - when your gear gets wet it tends to stay wet until you have a couple dry days.  By being at the hostel, most of my gear stays here when I slackpack so it has stayed dry.2-each day after slackpacking,  I come back to the hostel, take a hot shower, wash the clothes I wore that day, relax in the evening in the warm hostel, eat dinner at the diner next door, and get to sleep in a warm bed.  A good part of completing a thru-hike is mental.  You need to continue to enjoy it.  There is a cost to staying in a hostel or hotel and for shuttle rides, but my budget is not that of the younger hikers.  I think I can afford the $25/ night for the hostel + the cost of shuttle rides.3-I still have a healing blister on my right inner heel.  By being at the hostel, each day after my hike I am able to clean it and leave it open to help dry it up and help it heal.  If I were staying in shelters w/ temps <30-35 at night, it would be harder to treat it.  Hopefully by Tuesday it will be OK to hike on.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584027,"Left hostel at 8:15 this morning w/ Shadow driving Mac Daddy and I back to the AT at Yellow Creek Road.  We started hiking about 8:45 AM w/ temp about 30 and light snow.  We hiked easily for the 1st 1/2 hour to Cable Gap Shelter, then hiked up about 800 ft over 2 miles, then had a long downhill hike - down 2000 ft over 3 miles - to Fontana Dam Road.  Another 1.4 mile walk along Fontana Lake brought us to the Fontana Dam Shelter (aka the ""Fontana Hilton"").  Lonnie had again arranged to have a car left for us at the parking lot at the top of the hill.  Mac Daddy continued his slackpack another 1.1 miles past the shelter to the far side of the Fontana Dam (mile 166.4) while I drove to the Fontana Village Post Office and picked up my resupply box My wife had mailed to me.  I then drove back past the shelter and over the dam and picked up Mac Daddy, drove back to the shelter parking, and I hiked that additional 1.1 miles while he drove to the Fontana Lodge to pick up his maildrop and also purchase and print out his GSMNP thru-hiker pass.  Finally he drove back and over the dam to pick me up and we drove back to the hostel in Stecoah Creek.  We added that last 1.1 miles to shorten our planned hike tomorrow (to Mollies Ridge Shelter) from 12.0 to 10.9 miles. Temp today stayed just below freezing all day w/ cloudy skies and a constant light snow w/ only slight accumulation.  Visibility was limited.  We started our hike at 8:45 AM and completed the 7.3 miles to the Fontana Dam Shelter by 1 PM.  We returned to the hostel before 4 PM, took showers, did laundry, then had a nice beef stew Lonnie had brought over for us.  After dinner I relaxed a little, then started repacking my bag w/ my resupply - will leave tomorrow AM w/ about a 35# pack including 10+# of food - enough for my 6-7 day hike thru the Smokies.

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584340,"Started hiking this morning about 10 AM. Got to Spence Field Shelter at about 2:30 PM - mile 183.3.  Trails slick w/ packed snow and ice.  Temp only up to about 20 (but sun was shining). Shelter built for 12 - 6 on each of 2 levels.  Ended up having 25 hikers in shelter tonight - 9 packed in on top level, 8 packed in vertically on bottom level, 2 horizontally on ""shelf"" at front of bottom level, and 6 slept on floor.  There isn’t even room to get up to go to the bathroom at night.Between the hikes yesterday and today, I was thinking of giving up on my thru-hike.  When I hiked in 2014 I felt I got my ""trail legs"" after about 2 weeks.  At about 4 weeks this time, I still do not feel the same.  I have been hiking 6-10 mile days and struggle toward the end of the day, tending to feel like my legs are heavy and less sure after 6-8 miles.  If I were to continue hiking at this pace, it would take 7-8 months to complete the thru-hike.  So I decided to listen to my body and am calling it quits for the thru-hike.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584341,"This morning when I came out of the 2/10 mile side trail from Spence Field Shelter, I looked northward and the trail went up in elevation and was icy and very slippery.  I had sent my microspikes home w/ My wife and decided it would be safer to head back south. So today I hiked the 6 miles back to Mollies Ridge Shelter and am spending tonight here (about 16 hikers in shelter).  Temp was 35-40 during the day, only down to upper 20's tonight.My original plan was to hike north to Newfound Gap and get a ride to Gatlinburg and then get home from there, but turning back south was safer (and the road to Newfound Gap was still closed due to weather as of yesterday).","Spence Field Shelter

Thursday I had called Lonnie at Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel and reserved a room/ bed again for Friday and Saturday nights, also a shuttle ride from the trailhead.  Lonnie was there to pick me up at 4 PM, brought me back to the hostel, I showered and did my laundry, went to dinner at diner next door.  This evening after dinner I was able to book a flight home tomorrow evening from Asheville, NC - leaves about 6 PM and get to Albany after midnight.  Have shuttle arranged from here to Asheville airport, picking me up at 2:30 PM for a 1 hr 45 min shuttle ride ($100).

Class Act,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584346,"On bright side, I am in much better shape than I was 1 month ago.  I think I lost about 25#.  In future I think I will do section hikes for 2-3 week periods, may do couple this spring/ summer.  May start from near where I left off in 2014.  I am comfortable giving up the thru-hike.  Weather is up and down on the trail - it was not the reason I am stopping.  My bigger problem was that after 4 weeks both my daily distance and speed were not responding. If you hike an average of 15 miles/ day, 6 days/week w/ 1 zero/ week, it takes 5-1/2 to 6 months to complete the AT thru-hike.  I just was not getting there this time.  If I continued as I felt my body was letting me, I was looking at 7-8 months and, more importantly, not enjoying it because I was struggling.  When I quit the trail in 2014, I was down/ depressed.  Not this time.  I have and will continue to hike the AT, just no longer as an aspiring thru-hiker.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sat",0
