hiking plan for 2018 is to hike 710 miles from where I stopped last
year in Cornwall Bridge CT, north to the northern terminus at
Katahdin in Maine. The hike should take somewhere around two months
to carry out.

On
May 28, Dave Buchele, Lisa Abrams and I will leave Toledo Ohio for
Cornwall Bridge where they will drop me off on Wednesday May 30. My
plan is to start with low mileage days and increase the miles each
day. 107 miles north of me at Mt. Greylock MA is where my friend
Stealth stopped last year. On June 4th,
Stealth will leave from there heading north with low mileage days to
start with. I should catch-up with him a few days later.

A
couple of things about training for the hike this year. First of all the
bad, my weight is about 15 pounds heavier this year than last. Now
the good. Last year my trail pack weight was 35 pounds but I trained
with only a 25 pound pack weight, and paid for that the first week of
the hike. This year I have been hiking out at Pearson Park with a
pack weight of 38 pounds, and have been walking the stairs from my
apartment on the 15th
floor down to the 1st
floor and back up with a 50 pound pack.","

Dave and Lisa dropped me off back on the AT in Cornwall Bridge,
Connecticut where I had stopped last year. I hiked 8.3 miles to a
campsite.

5/31:
Hiked 13.3 miles to a site just outside Salisbury, CT. Like the day
before it was hot and humid. Not a good day for a hike.

6/01:
Hiked 10.8 miles. Up and down all day. 1,920' Bear Mountain was a
very steep ascent/descent of rocks. Late afternoon, I went up 2,365'
Mt. Race crossing into Massachusetts with not enough water and by the
time I got to my campsite, I sat down and just passed out for about an hour.

6/02:
Hiked 18.2 miles. Two things that happened over night. At 10:20 pm, I
was in my tent sleeping and was woken up by bears ( that's with a
“S”) coming into my camp. I did not open my tent to see them, but
there were more than one of them. They checked the place out and
moved on. In all about 15-20 minutes. I then went back to sleep. Then
at 1 am a very heavy rain storm came through and most of my things
ended up wet. On the fourth day of heat and humidity, I hiked 18.2
miles with very weak legs including going up and over 2,602' Mt.
Everett, which was nothing but wet slippery rocks. I spent the night
at the Day's Inn in Great Barrington.

Story
of the day: After checking into my room and getting cleaned up, I
was ready for a burger and a beer. Right in front of the Day's Inn
was the town's Welcome/Visitor Center. I stopped in to find a place
where I could get a burger and a beer that was in easy walking
distance. Upon entering, the woman greeted me by saying that
before she help me, I needed to tell her where I was from. When I
told her Toledo, Ohio she got very exceeded and told me she had just
been there last Thanksgiving to visit her cousin. She then told me
his name, and asked if I knew him, when I said no, she said that he
was a very famous lawyer, and in a small town like Toledo, I should
know who he was. I told her that I have no reason to know any
lawyers, and that Toledo was not a small town, but had 300,000 people
in it. She responded by telling me that he lived in the very nice
neighborhood by the only nice park in Toledo. I asked what she was
talking about, for Toledo has a number of very nice parks. She came
back by asking me which part of town I lived in, and  when
I told her downtown, she said that I must be poor for no one would
live downtown if they could avoid it. It was time to change the
subject. I told her I had come in, looking for a nice restaurant nearby for that I wanted to get a burger and a beer. Next to her was a
stake of magazines with all the town's information and maps in it.
She opened the top copy to help me find a restaurant and I reminded
her that I wanted a burger and a beer. The first place she told me
about, she said that they serve breakfast all day, and I asked her if
they have burgers and beer, she said of course not. I again told her
that I wanted a burger and a beer, so she told me of another place
that is only open for breakfast and lunch. Again I said, I want a
burger and a beer. Next she started telling me of a good Mexican
restaurant, I reached over the counter and grabbed a copy of the
magazine telling her that I was positive that I could find a
restaurant that serves burgers and beers long before she could, and I
walked out.

back together again.","Cornwall Bridge, Connecticut

Hiked 19.1 miles. The trail was up and down all day. I spent the
night at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. This place is free, and you should
not pay more than that.

6/05:
Hiked 20.6 miles. Went over I90 early on, and then the trail was to
run flat into Dalton, MA. This was a lie. The trail seem to go up
300' then down 300' over and over again. 15 miles into this day's
hike, I passed my “total” trail halfway point. I could only think
of all the work and pain I had gone through and I'm only half done.
At the end of the day, Dave & Lisa picked me up at a road
crossing for a much needed night off the trail in Dalton, MA.

6/06:
Zero day. I told Dave and Lisa that I was not ready to hike and that
I needed a zero day, so we hit some of the area views and had a real
nice day off.","Great Barrington

Hiked 13.2 miles. I crossed the Massachusetts-Vermont border today,
which is also the start of the southern end of the Long Trail. One of
the climbs was a very rocky climb up. I did a lot of hiking this day
with a man named Slow Moe. I ended up staying at a shelter.

6/09:
Hiked 11.5 miles. Hiking with Slow Moe, DoRight and Chief, we were
all going to spend the night in Bennington VT. Coming down a very
hard descent to State route 9, I was the first one down just in time
to see an accident. The four of us met up for dinner.
Story
of the day:
The accident. When I got down to State route 9, I was planning on
hitchhiking the 5 miles to Bennington. I crossed the road to where a
parking lot was and set about hitchhiking. A jeep with four guys in
their early twenties coming down the road on my side, put their right
turn signal on indicating that they would be turning into the parking
lot where I was standing. I stepped back a step or two to let them
in, and as they were turning in, they changed their mind, and turned
left . Two motorcycles were coming up behind them, and as the jeep
started to turn right, they moved to pass on the left. When the jeep
then turned left, they just missed the first motorcycle, but the second
one ran into the rear of the jeep. This happened about 5 yards from me.
I went into the road to assist the motorcycle diver now laying in
the road but he was not seriously hurt. We got the jeep and the
motorcycle to the side of the road, but could not call 911 for there
was no cell phone service. A woman who had stopped to help, drove
into Bennington where she could call for help, and then came back to
let us know that help was coming. I think that the entire Bennington
police and fire departments came to the scene. I told the first
police officer on the scene that I was a witness and he asked just a
couple of questions about how far back the motorcycle was when the
jeep started turning. The motorcycle driver ended up being taken to
the hospital. Slow Moe got a ride into town with the woman who had
called 911, and DoRight, Chief and I got picked up from the motel
owner from where we were planning on staying.","

Hiked 14.4 miles. I got a late start out of Bennington, and the trail
was not giving miles on this day. Spent the night at Kid Gore
shelter.

6/11:
Hiked 15 miles. The day's hike was based on the climb up 3,936' Mt.
Stratton. I was happy when this one was over.

6/12:
Hiked 10.7 miles. A cool day that started in the mid 40's. It was a 6
hour hike that was really nice. Stayed with DoRight and Chief at the
Green Mountain house. This was easily the best place I have stayed on
the whole trail so far. The cost for hikers was $38 a night.","Bennington VT

Hiked 14.8 miles. DoRight and Chief stopped 10 miles into the hike
for the night after two hard 1,000' climbs. I had told Stealth that I
would meet up with him on 6/15 so I had to keep going. Late in the
day's hike, I went up Baker Peak which was a smooth 150 yard rock that
was going uphill in a very steep ascent. Thank God it was not wet.

6/14:
Hiked 18.1 miles. It had rained hard during the night, and the trail
was a mess. At least I was not going up Baker peak that day. Going
over Bear Mountain, I passed this hike's 200 mile mark.
Story
of the day.
The Vermont Mud. South bound hikers were calling Vermont, “Ver-Mud”.
When I crossed into the state, I found out why. The southern quarter
of the state has this mud that is permanent mud. I have never seen
anything like it. I would expect that long term mud would only be in
low line areas. This mud was everywhere.

6/15:
Hiked 17.1 miles. I had spent the night in my tent, and around
midnight the rain started. When I got up at 5 AM, I was in a very
heavy rain storm. There was nothing I could do but take down my tent
and carry all the extra water weight for the day. By mid day the rain
had moved on as I ascended 3,908' Shrewsbury Peak. Late in the day, I
come to the point where the Long Trail leaves the AT. I can now say
that I did 105.2 miles of the Long Trail. I spent the night at the
Inn at Long Trail, just a few miles from my friend Stealth. Where he
was staying was full.

6/16:
Hiked 3.9 miles. I hiked over to where Stealth was staying, which was
the Mountain Meadows Lodge at Kent Pond, there was now room for me.
It was great to see and talk to Stealth again, and the two of us went
out for a burger and a beer.","

Hiked 13.5 miles. Temperature in the 90's. Spent the night at Lookout
cabin. The only issues with this place was that there was no water
there.

6/18:
Hiked 14.8 miles. Temperature in the mid 90's again, but now there
was also very high humidity, which I do not handle well. This was a
hard/bad hiking day for me. Spent the night in my tent at Thistle
Hill Shelter.

6/19:
Hiked 14.7 miles. It rained for about 4 hours overnight, and that ended
the heat and humidity. It was a great day for a hike. Late in the day
I crossed into New Hampshire. Stayed the night in Hanover N.H.

6/20:
Hiked 10.9 miles. Got a late start after doing my laundry. Tented
with Stealth and Treeline at Moose Mountain Shelter.

6/21:
Hiked 12.4 miles. It was below 32 degrees when I got up. The hike was
up and down all day. By the time I got to 3,230' Smarts Mountain, the
Fire Warden's Cabin (which was empty) was ours for the night. Again it
was Stealth, Treeline, and I.

6/22:
Hiked 17.5 miles. Big day for I passed my 300 miles marker for this
hike. Mt Cube was a hard climb. Stealth and I tented a top Mt. Mist.
I set my tent up about one foot off the trail. Rain is coming.

Story
of the day: Egg man. On June 21st,
a south bounder had told me that there was a man making free egg
omelets for all hikers on a road near Lonesome lake hut. By the time Stealth and I came upon the road mid afternoon on June 22nd, we had
both forgotten about the Egg Man. He made us both a 3 egg omelet with
a lot of ham, green peppers, and cheese in them, plus give us juice
to drink. Man, did that taste good. Thanks for the meal.

Hiked 9.3 miles. Hiked up a very wet 4,802' Mt. Moosilauke. The last
two miles coming down was the steepest yet. This descent was not
without peril. This was the first time I think my personal safety was
really at risk. Afterwards, Stealth told me that 20-25 times he
questioned taking the next step forward. Getting near the bottom, there
was a place where the trail was washed away for maybe 8' to 10' with
a 20' to 25' fall down to the rocks and water. You could not just
walk around it, so Stealth and I slowly worked our way across. I went
first. After that, and with more rain due overnight, we stayed at
the Woodstock Inn, in North Woodstock, NH.","

Hiked 11.2 miles. Late morning stop at the Lonesome lake hut for free
cold eggs and bacon that they had left over from their guess. Just as
Stealth and I were heading up 5,089' Mt. Lincoln, a hiker named Stark
Bait told us of bad weather coming in that evening and throughout the
next day. After Mt. Lincoln, we went up Mt. Lafayette at 5,263'.
There was Green Leaf hut 1.1 miles down a side trail from the top
which no thru hikers goes to due to the distance off the main trail.
With the storm coming at us, we went to the hut and asked for Work to
stay. The crew boss could not say yes fast enough. I told him we were
also looking for it the whole next day due to the storm, and he told
me that we would talk about that in the morning.
Story
of the day. Work
to stay in the Huts of the White Mountains is only for thru hikers.
The hiker gets dinner and breakfast after the guest eats, and the
place is cleaned up by the crew. Then the crew and the hikers eat
what is left. After each meal, you then have to do some work for
about an hour. At night, you sleep on the floor in the dining room
under the tables.

6/28:
Zero day. Work to stay is a one night only deal, but with the storm
to last all day, the crew boss came to me about 5:30 AM to talk,
saying it was unsafe to head back out and that the zero day had been
approved. I did a whole lot of nothing, but more work than the boss
was looking for me to do.","

Hiked 13.5 miles, plus the 1.1 miles back up from the hut. This
hiking day was 14 hours, and that is way too much, but there was just
no place to stop. Near the top of 4,902' South Twin Mountain, a
thunderstorm came from nowhere. Stealth and I put our rain gear on
and got about 20 yards apart. Getting on the ground, lower than the
very short tree's (we were at the tree line). The best way to say
what happened, is to say that I was “in” the thunderstorm. It
was a very tense time for about 20 minutes.
After that came 4,580' Mt. Guyot and on the way down,
the AT actually goes down a rock waterfalls for about 90'. Then
came a very fast and deep “river”. I had to throw my 35 pound
backpack over the river which was about 6-10 yards across, then get a
running start and jump it. If I would have missed, my backpack and or
me would have gone down the river 50-100 yards with many large rocks
on the way down. Just past that river there was a brook also running
very high. I forged through the woods upstream about 50 yards
to a somewhat
better crossing and managed to get across. I spent the night at
Zealand Hut again on the work to stay deal.
6/30:
Hiked 7.8 miles. I was given more work at the hut then I should have
been given, and got a late start. Just into the day's hike, I made a
wrong turn(the 1st
time
on my AT hike) and had gone about a 1/3 of a mile before I saw a
yellow blaze (the AT blazes
are
white). I turned around and went back until I found a white blase,
and then moved on. Stealth's daughter Jen lives in Bethlehem NH and
we stayed with her for the night. We got cleaned up, and the three of
us went out for a nice dinner.","

hard day, but Stealth and I want to go back to Jen's house for the
4th
of July, and this day and the next is what we have to do to
get there. We came into Lake of the Clouds hut about 7:30 PM and got
work to stay again. There was over a 100 guess there and the 9:30 PM
light out and quiet hour did not take hold until after midnight.

7/2:
Hiked 10.3 miles. The top of Mt. Washington was only a mile and a
half or 1,200' of elevation away. It is a big time tourist place. The
peak is right next to the parking lot. When I came to the top, dense
fog had viability down to about 5'. In the time I was there, things got better. I have been carrying my winter gear just for this day and
I ended up not needing it after all. After Mt. Washington comes the
Presidential. That is a number of peaks each named after a U.S.
President. What I now know is that it was an eight mile hike through a
rock and boulder field that made Pennsylvania feel like kids play. My
ankles and feet really paid the full price for these miles. I came
into Osgood tent site late, and went right to sleep.","

of the day: Coming into the Imp camp site, the wind was really

help me. This night was really crazy. Two groups of hikers had to be
rescued from an area near me due to hypothermia. It was below freezing

wind was still cutting like a knife. Not until I put my raincoat
over the sleeping bag to act as a windbreaker, could I get to sleep.

Zero day. The closest Urgent Care to Gorham is 65 miles away, so I had
to get a ride about 10 miles over to Berlin NH where Androscoggin
Valley Hospital is for medical help. The x-ray showed that I had a
closed avulsion fracture of my right ankle. My hike must stop until
my ankle heals.

7/09:
Zero day. I'm not going to just sit in a hostel for weeks waiting for
my ankle to heal, so I will go back to Toledo and come back when I am
ready to hike again. I had a 7 am shuttle from the hostel to the Bus
station in Gorham where I could catch the Concord Coach Line bus to
Boston. The bus got into Boston at 12:15 PM, my Amtrak train to
Toledo was scheduled to depart at 1:20 PM. I would be back in Toledo
at 7 AM on July 10th.

Story
of the day: The train story. Before I left on this hike, I
decided that I would ride Amtrak from Boston back to Toledo when the
hike was over at a cost of $77. Right after I decided this, Amtrak
announced that this route would no longer have a lounge car with it.
When I was at the Hospital, I had them print me off the train
schedule for Amtrak to Toledo. The train leaves Boston's south
station every day at 12:50 pm. When I got back to the Hostel from the
Hospital, I was given great news that there was a bus station in
Gorham, and the bus went to Boston each day at 7:50 AM at a cost of
$38. When I was buying my bus ticket, I was informed that not only
does the bus go to the south station, but it would get there at 12:20 pm,
giving me a half an hour to get to my train. Coming into the south
station, I asked the woman next to me how to get from the bus to
Amtrak, and she told me to just follow her, which I did, and when we
got there, she pointed out the Amtrak ticket window to me. At the
ticket window, I asked for a $77 ticket for that day's train to
Toledo, and if there was a lounge car with the train. She confirmed
that there was no lounge car, and that my ticket was $185 because I
did not buy it two weeks in advance. Coming from the ticket window,
there was a large food court area of which the first place was
advertising that they were selling bottle water for $1 each. With my
train not having a lounge car, I would not be able to get any food or
drink during the 17 hour train ride to Toledo, so I ordered two
waters and was told that it would cost me $4.17. When I pointed out
that the overhead sign said that they were $1, she told me that was
only if you also buy a large pizza. I was going to need the water for
the ride, so I got the two bottles. Next I saw the big board with all
the trains listed, with my train listed as on time at 1:20 pm, not
the 12:50 pm that was on the web site. I had trail food with me, but
with this extra time I decided to get some lunch at the station. It
was lunchtime and all of the food court was busy. The only place
that looked like you could get some food fast was McDonald's. I have
not eaten at McDonald's in decades but there I went. When I saw that
a quarter pounder with cheese without the meal was $10, I decided
that trail food was fine for me. As the train was leaving the
station, the very first thing that we were told was that the lounge
car was open. Around Midnight, I got up to walk the train to stretch
my legs a little bit, and notice that 50 to 70 percent of the
passengers were Amish. The train ended up getting into Toledo
an hour late, and then I had to walk the mile home from there.","
