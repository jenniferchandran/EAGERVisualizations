Overdue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593914,"First day on the trail! After a fun night of seeing the head & the heart in Providence and staying at Brittany’s sisters house in Boston we headed out to western mass to start the trail. Tory & Caleb, Brittany’s sister and her boyfriend, hiked the first several miles with us. After that encountered the first steps I helped construct when in SCA Massachusetts AmeriCorps, which was really cool to still see them there. Passed a pond with tons or dragon flies, and crossed a bunch of stone walls which is always cool. Great first day and looking forward to what’s to come.","Great Barrington

Overdue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593916,"Got started a little later, which was nice and the day never felt too strenuous, plus got into the cabin at about 2 so we had time to take our the free canoes out for a spin. Paddles around a little island on the lake that had cairns scattered around the shore, very cool. Really cool hundred year old cabin, cool stone fire place and about 7ish bunk beds on the top floor- although Brittany and I tented it. Met a couple of other through hikers, trail names Bearchaser (chased a bear out of his bag once) & caveman (climbed into a cave to retieve his pole). Brittany’s trail name is Library & I have yet to recieve one so looking forward to that. This cabin has pancakes for breakfast so really looking forward to that!","Shaker campsite

Walked through some really cool marshes traversing on big bridges, then opening up to pine forests with tons of pink ladies slippers. We’re planning on stopping at the cookie ladies house (where you can rent overninght) but since it was only 2:30p decided to buy a Klondike bar, fill up on water (& cookies) and push on to the next shelter 6.6 mi away. Had a good afternoon, ending with a nice mountain overlook of mt greylock in the distance. Sang Grateful Dead songs in my head to pass the time and felt really good getting to the shelter around 5:30p and after our first really long day. Ran into caveman & bearchaser at the shelter & received my trailname- overdue! So that together Brittany and I are library & overdue. I think it’s perfect also, since it’s overdue for me to do a hike like this. Tomorrow we’ll pass through Dalton, get some showers and continue our journey.","Upper goose pond cabin

Once we got down toward north Adams, there was a sign for free bikes to borrow to ride around the city so me and library borrowed bikes to ride to grab lunch and buy some food from the grocery store.

Got to the highway at about 930 and only had to stick out or thumbs for about 15min before a nice Subaru picked us up and drove us into town. After grabbing breakfast at Up for Breakfast- delicious- headed to the outfitter to grab some new fuel and shoes to hopefully solve my toe blister problem, got some nice Solomon’s so looking forward to putting some miles in with them for the rest of the trail. Ran into the hostel owner while in town so dropped off our packs before heading to the grocery store, followed by a huge bag of popcorn and cup of soda while watching the newly released Incredibles II.  Headed to the hostel, which is really nice and we’re able to shower, do laundry, and make a meal in the kitchen. Our friend caveman is staying here too which is nice. Perfect day for staying inside with all the wind and rain, and lucky for us looks like perfect hiking weather for the rest of the week.

Near the top, the trail ran along a ski run and opened up into a beautiful view at the summit. Beautiful hiking through some gorgeous Vermont bogs, although my pack heavy with food and trying to break in new shoes slowed me down a little.

Got down the mountain and to the road at about 12, and just as we were going to catch a hitch into town, a bus pulled up that was going there so we ended up taking that. In Rutland we stopped by the Yellow Deli, a hiker hostel run by the 12 tribes for a free shower, then left our stuff there while we went to buy supplies until our next town stop. We grabbed an awesome lunch at the place called roots, then went back to the deli, changed into our hiking clothes and did another 3 mi to our stop for the night.","

Really started pouring around 2 by the luckily we only hadn’t to hike another couple hours before we got to the cabin where we were staying; a cool old cabin with a lookout on the roof that the farmers let hikers stay in. There was no water so we just stocked up before getting there, but only one other hiker showed up so we basically had the place to our selves. After dinner, the rain let up and we saw some amazing clouds rolling over the green mountains, so beautiful.","

After a few more miles came upon a farm stand and had a great stop there, sharing a maple soda, a pickle, and a peach/blueberry pie- it was delicious and excellent fodder for making our way up the next few hills. Hiking through the forest we came upon a barred owl and enjoyed watching it watch us and flit between trees for a while- so cool. As with the rest of Vermont, beautiful overlooks abound, lots cool trees, moss covered rocks, and red Efteling all over the forest floor.","

Felt really good today and great day for hiking. Got into town at about 2 and pretty much immediately ran into the nice people we’d called yesterday who let hikers stay at their house. We got our tent dried out, showered, then headed into town for some food. There’s all these places in hanover that give free food to hikers so went there first- Dan & Whita for a free sandwich, Ramuntos for a slice of pizza, and Lous bakery for a free donut. We also grabbed some Nepali food and a delicious Thai burrito and Nutella shake- I guess our hiker appetites are in full effect! Once we got back to the house one of the other hikers staying there, who’s from Italy, made us all carbonara- it was so delicious. Then we sat around the table telling stories before falling a sleep on a nice soft bed in the basement. Truly a great day.","

On the way down ran into a trail angel called the omelette man who had this tent set up with bananas, orange juice, donuts and made us delicious omelettes with fresh onions and peppers. That helped energize us for the rest of the hike before arriving at Glencliff and the hostel where we were staying that night.

Amazing views from the top, hiking down was slow but so fun; incredible waterfalls cascading next to us and some of the most impressive trail work I’ve ever seen- rebar and wood steps set directly into the rock face. We set up camp near the bottom an just after we’d got our tent set up and a fire started, a trail angel named Terodactyl came by saying he was doing trail magic in the parking lot and extended a generous offer for ya to stay at his house that night. We agreed, and had a great time chit chatting while his wife made us a delicious dinner, then swam in their indoor pool and hot tub. It’s just so amazing to me the generousoty and kindness people have for their brethren on the trail, he’d through hiked in ‘16 & just wanted to help those coming this year.

Then started our hike up Kinsman Mountain, which was really steep but awesome- really felt like rock climbing scrambling over the big rocks and using the cracks to pull ourselves up. Once we’d gotten to the summit we took in then views then headed down the equally steep other side. We were going to stop at the Lonesome lake hut, which if you’re early you can do work for stay and get dinner & breakfast leftovers, but we just stopped since it was getting late.

Overdue,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598526,"Had an awesome breakfast prepared by Poet, the hostel owner, of 3 eggs, 3 pieces of bacon, hash browns and unlimited blueberry pancakes. Just relaxed all day- walked to the AT visitor center to get info about ending our journey and permits for Baxter state park, ate a bunch of food and lounges around watching  The Avengers: Age of Ultron & Captain America: The Winter Soldier- truly a great day. Feeling refreshed and ready to continue our hike!","Shaw’s Hiker Hostel
