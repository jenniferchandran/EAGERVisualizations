Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584777,"We purchased the last of our gear needs this week and except for some food and fuel we are done!  We purchased Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer puffies as ours were too heavy!  Also taking a hammock along this year for lounging around the campsite.  Shaved five pounds off our packs by careful weighing and tough decisions.  Our luxury items are a GSI insulated cup, the hammock, and a candle lantern.  Using ULA packs this time as well.  The tough part of section hiking is getting in shape again!  We have been hitting the gym, lots of stair master and treadmill set on Hills!!!  We also walk several miles a day and plan to start adding our packs.  We will be doing a few other hikes to help prepare including a section of the Superior Hiking Trail and a bit of the Long Trail in Northern Vermont.  The great part of section hiking is you get to hike over and over again,  every year.",,Upper Goose Pond to Stratton Mtn,"Mar 23, Fri",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584966,"In order to get to the trail we will first fly to Boston and stay with our son and his family.  We then take the train to Pittsfield and Uber to Lee for the night.  After a hardy breakfast we will take a cab to the trailhead on Hwy 20 and start the climb up to October Mtn.  We always start early making reservations for travel and motel rooms hoping to catch a better price.  We are meeting our family at Bascom Lodge on Mt. Greylock later in the trip, that should be amazing with the grandkids who have hiking poles and love to camp.  We loved the hike two years previous from NYC to Lee, many great memories of Upper Goose Pond and canoeing, pancakes etc.
Last year we did the stretch North up from Harper's Ferry after three days in DC, great fun! Our goal is to do the entire trail before we get to decrepit to walk, Smokey's or Whites in 2019.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Mon",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586773,Planning a short hike on the Superior Hiking Trail in May and on the Long Trail in June to help prepare for Mass/Vermont AT Section hike.  I have gotten our packs down to 24lbs for Pappy (me) and 21.5lbs for Grammy.  This is mostly though all the little things.  It helps that there are several towns on our journey to grab burgers and lots of water.  The switch to ULA Ohm for my wife has really helped.  She had the Osprey Aura which she loves for comfort but the lighter Ohm is pretty comfortable too.  I have been purchasing some Packit Gourmet meals as shown in the Shug videos.  They are super!  We love the Ramen Rescue!  I will update with some newer photos once we get back from our shake down hikes.,,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sun",0
Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601840,"Just finished our hike on the AT.  Great fun!  Started with a Twins vs Red Sox game thanks to our son.  Took the train to Lee and started hiking in the morning.  Good weather and lots of trail magic on the first two days.  Beautiful hike into Dalton and great visit with the Cookie Lady.  The next day it rained very heavily so we took a zero.  Got up early and hiked to Cheshire, fantastic misty hike and lunch on the cobbles.  Rain forecasted so we took a bus to North Adams and then to Williamsburg where we met our son and spent the night at Bascom Lodge.  The next day we hiked to the border and left trail magic but then it was time to head home.  Great trip, next year Virginia!","Lee, MA

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601977,"Our new ULA packs worked great, Grammy had the Ohm 2.0 and I had the Circuit.  Hugged our hips so no shoulder pain.  Lightened our total load with food and water to 24lbs., getting there.","

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601978,"I would recommend the Shamrock Motel.  We had to take a zero there due to heavy rain.  Close to PO, bar, and café.  Had a great dinner at the bar, thanks staff!","

Pappy and Grammy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603252,"We are prepping to take a hike on the Superior Hiking Trail. Our first cold weather hiking, though not too cold.  Next summer we hope to do Shenandoah National Park on the AT and more SHT.  Photo is of Shamrock Motel where we had to stay during crazy rain event in August.  Excellent meal at Bascom Lodge by the way!",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Wed",0
