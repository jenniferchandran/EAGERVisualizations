Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572557,"Hi.  My trail name is trebolita and my 7-year-old daughter's trail name is Coquí.  We are super excited to start our adventure of hiking part of the LT in August.  Coquí has been hiking with me practically since birth.  This will, however, be her first time doing more than two nights at a time and doing it with her own full pack!  We're pretty close to having everything we need, except the food.  Working on logistics now...",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Mon",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572559,"So what I've decided would work best for us on this adventure, is to get dropped off in Vermont at the trail head so I don't have to worry about leaving my car in the parking lot to get vandalized.  So the logistics of the drop off are all set.  We'll get dropped off kind of late, early evening maybe, and be able to hike a mile or two in and set up camp.  A good way to break into it slowly!  My aunt who lives near Middlebury will come get us if we decide we can't or don't want to hike anymore (I really don't anticipate this happening, but one never knows...).  If we do quit early, my aunt will take us back to her house to visit for however many days we would have had left to hike, then she'll bring us back down to where we started so our ride can take us back home.  It's a pretty solid plan except we may be stuck waiting for the rides due to their work schedules.  During the hike we will have to head into town to resupply, haven't worked that out totally yet.  Logistics are made more difficult with a 7-year-old, but I am extremely lucky that Coquí is like me... flexible and kind of just goes with the flow without getting worked up.  Ok, We have more planning and preparing to do!",,View Entry,"Jul 12, Wed",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572560,"Why would I take a 7-year-old into the woods for two weeks and deal with not just 7-year-old 'stuff', but also the mud, bugs, heat, cold, rain, body stench,  blisters, hunger, and everything else that comes with hiking?  That's what I can't tell you how many people have asked me since I started talking about this adventure.  My answer to that question is ""why not?""  Why not grow a deeper bond with my daughter?  Why not play in the icky gooey mud, give the bugs cool names like Dracula, jump into a cold river when we get hot or have a cup of hot chocolate when we get cold, dance in the rain, take a survey on who stinks more, wipe away tears while patching up blisters, go into town and see how much we can eat and how fast we can eat it...?  Why not?  People tell me I'm crazy to do it and some have even tried to get me to NOT do it.  I just can't NOT do it.  While everything I mentioned above may sound like a nightmare vacation to others, it sound AMAZING to me and I am soooooo soooooo excited to start this adventure with Coquï!",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Sat",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573547,"I THOUGHT my plan was solid but apparently it was mush... but it's all good, just changed around a bit.    Instead of getting dropped off at the southern end of the trail and hiking north, I'm going to leave my car at my aunt's house and start hiking where the trail goes sort of close to her house (so she can drop us off and pick us up when we're done), and now hiking north to south.  It's not what I wanted, but I'll be starting where I left off many years ago and going south instead of north.  I would go north (I would LOVE to do the part of the trail I haven't done yet), but the trail beyond Camel's Hump will be difficult for Coquí, being her first time out with a full pack (AKA me being ridiculously unprepared physically!).  I know there are some amazing things for us to see in the section we'll be doing so it's all good.  Maybe next year we'll attempt a through hike... if we survive the next two weeks!   Coquí said she wasn't going to be able to sleep tonight or tomorrow night but guess what she's doing?  Lol!  We leave in two days.... so exciting!!!",,View Entry,"Jul 29, Sat",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573762,"We made it to my Aunt's house in Vermont, and right now I'm in bed writing this journal entry with Coqui sound asleep at my side.  Tomorrow my Aunt will drive us to the trailhead and we will set out on our adventure.  I'm wondering what major things I may have forgotten to pack... oh well, it wouldn't be an adventure without adding some adventure to it, lol!!  Time to sleep...",,View Entry,"Jul 31, Mon",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574192,"My aunt dropped us off at the trailhead in Middlebury Gap today.  She took a 'before' pic of us then after a quick hug disappeared down the road.  
Some thoughts after today's hike (Coquí's first time with a full pack):
Today's best according to Trebolita - being proud of Coquí for making it (and without a single booboo), standing on the chairlifts with the gorgeous views, and meeting Caboose and his daughter Puma who were doing a through hike (who very politely answered all of my hiking questions and sacrificed a water bottle so we could survive the next waterless section of trail). 
Today's best according to Coquí - camping, making grape juice and mac and cheese (Trebolita spilled it by the river, but it was promptly eaten by who knows what...), sitting in the brook (cold!), seeing a “car” in the middle of the trail (trail hallucinations?).
Todays worst according to Trebolita - carrying two backpacks for two miles and losing one of our two water bottles (it fell out in the car).
Today's worst according to Coquí - feeling like she was going to ""pass out"" and having to pee in a two-sided privy (""everyone can SEE Mom!"").
Coquí's quote of the day - “I want to be sitting in a river right NOW Mom!” 
We started out around 10:00 this morning and got to the shelter exhausted at 4:15.  I think we may have stopped for breath about 3,000 times along the way and took about 700 pack-off breaks (Coquí)... but who's counting?  We took pictures of cool trees growing on rocks, enormous frogs (lots of food up here I guess), ""ji-normous"" piles of moose poop (no moose though), colorful butterflies and flowers, salamanders and newts, and lots of other stuff.  We were snoring by 8:30!","Middlebury Gap

Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574216,"Todays best according to Trebolita -  having oatmeal and hot chocolate for breakfast, playing words games and making up silly stories while we hiked (to keep Coquí's mind off what she was ACTUALLY doing), being so high up on the mountains and seeing some spectacular views, being so incredibly proud of Coquí for hiking nearly 11 miles), getting a ride from Monique when we had given up on the whole hitchhiking idea and being invited to spend the night at her house (we were the first strangers she had ever given a ride!), and getting pizza and beer and ice cream and a comfy bed and interesting conversation and a playmate for Coquí (Monique's daughter) and a loaned VT trails book.  She should consider opening a hostel here, she's awesome!
Today's best according to Coquí - hot breakfast, hiking far and getting strong legs, and getting pizza and a ride from Monique and playing tag with her daughter (after hiking like 11 miles... whaaaaat?!?!).
Todays worst according to Trebolita -  having oatmeal and hot chocolate for breakfast and realizing why I am not a math teacher… , no one picking us up when we tried hitchhiking into town (did we really look (smell) THAT terrible??), and Mt. Horrid closed for peregrine falcon nesting (really??).  
Today's worst according to Coquí - bug bites, rash (you-know-where), road walking into town, road walking, more road walking, no one picking us up when mom was hitchhiking....
Coquí's quote of the day - “God sends wind so the trees can talk.”
We decided to get off the trail when we hit Brandon Gap due to Coqui's terrible rash.  The plan was to hitchike into Brandon, since Caboose told us that they got a ride from the first truck that came along... We ended up walking around 11 miles total including the road walking.  
We gave up on hitchhiking, the cars just kept taking a wide berth around us without slowing down.  We sat in the grass at the edge of the road as the sun was going down and I kept my calm, saying, ""We'll be fine, we have headlamps and water (after bushwhacking down a small cliff off the highway to filter some), we'll make it into town and find a hostel.""  
As we were dousing ourselves with more bugspray, a car pulled over and the woman inside asked, ""Do you guys need a ride?""  I was like, ""Seriously???, Yes!!!""  She was taking us down into Brandon while feeding us the hot most amazing pizza we'd ever eaten that she had just picked up, when she said it was silly for us to sleep off the road in Brandon somewhere and took us all the way back up the hill (we had just walked down) to her house.  She and her husband and daughter made us feel so incredibly at home and welcomed, I'm so thankful to have met them.  
We decided that Coquí needs to take time off to heal that nasty rash.  We're going to do some day hikes, go camping, see a rodeo, and go to a fair for the rest of our time in Vermont.  Next year we will be back to continue this amazing experience together and put in some serious miles!","Sucker Brook Shelter

Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584603,"Life definitely takes us in crazy directions, doesn’t it?  Since I last wrote about my Long Trail adventure last summer, I have quit my job of 20 years and moved to Virginia with my now 8-year-old daughter Coquí.
I have only about two weeks left of my self-induced “vacation” time, so here’s the plan:  
This weekend - backpacking the AT in Georgia for 3-4 days.  I’m excited because I’ve been dying to see the beginning of this amazing on-my-bucket-list trail that is literally now in my back yard!  About being in shape?  NOT!  Should be interesting...
Next week - headed to Florida.  Coquí has never been to Florida and we are super excited!  
The rest of my life - having peace and happiness while I explore this amazing world.  I can’t wait to see what adventures lie ahead for us!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Wed",0
Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585179,"What an amazing few days!  I started at the visitor Center at Amicalola Falls State Park and took the AT Approach Trail up to Springer Mountain where the Appalachian Trail begins.  I can’t even describe what an incredible feeling to see the very first white blaze on the trail that I have hiked in CT most of my life!  Seeing and talking to all of the through-hikers beginning their journeys was just the coolest thing ever and made me envious, some day I WILL do this entire trail!  The first night in the mountains was soooo incredibly cold, I literally thought I would freeze to death and never wake up... but I didn’t, and I did wake up.  Lesson learned?  Buy good quality lightweight layers that will actually keep you warm.  Oh, and bring gloves!  While it was a challenge hiking in the incessant frozen winds all day, the weather began to warm for the last couple days and it was awesome hiking!  
This was a shakedown hike of sorts because I wanted to test out my new gear.  I used my new tent, and I LOVE my Big Agnes!  It was tough hiking out of shape, but I did better than I thought I would and could have continued hiking to my goal destination of Neels Gap, but I was low on food and wanted to get back.  Next time I will start at Gooch and continue north!  I love being in the woods, the mountains are where I find my peace.  This hike was one I will never forget and I can’t wait to go on my next adventure!","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Clover,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618341,"We are soooooo excited.  Tomorrow we will be dropped off at the trail to begin our 100-mile trek on the AT!  Coquí is now 9 years old so I’m thinking she should be able to handle it.  Our last long-distance attempt was thwarted by her rashes so this time we are hopefully better prepared!  Yesterday we spent lots of time bug spraying and waterproofing and packing and planning.  Today just a few tweaks to make and try on the packs to check the fit.  We’ll be getting to the trail a little late tomorrow so only a mile or so and we’ll set up camp.  I hope you leave us some encouraging messages, we would love to read them!  
According to Coquí:  
The good - Getting ready with Mom
The bad - Shopping for the stuff
The ugly - Smelly backpacking stuff ?
According to Clover:
The good - The excitement!
The bad - Spending too much money...
The ugly - Brain cell eating waterproofing and bug sprays ?",,View Entry,"Jul 08, Mon",0
