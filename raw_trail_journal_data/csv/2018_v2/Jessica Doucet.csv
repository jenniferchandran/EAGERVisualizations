Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579306,"Excited to be posting my first entry, I think it will take a few entries before I have this whole journal thing all figured out.  I debated whether or not I wanted to document my pre, during and post hike experiences doing a video blog or trail journals but figured the journals would hopefully be a more convenient way for me to track my adventure when I am on the trail. It feels weird to share my thoughts online, but I know I enjoy reading other trail journals, so who knows, someone might enjoy reading about my experiences too.   
I love hiking and have been on many multiday hikes, but wanted to take it to the next level. There are so many reasons why I want to experience the trail, I want to challenge myself, meet new people and further appreciate the small things in life. For the last 4 years I have wanted to hike the AT, but it has never been a good time in my career to take a significant amount of time off work and school. For the longest time I always thought someone like me would never be able to do something like this, you only hear about people  who do this stuff or watch it on TV. I watched a lot of video blogs on YouTube and read trail journals of people who were planning on doing the AT in the future or have already completed it and it seems like almost everyone had the same thoughts, if other people can do it, why can't I?",,View Entry,"Oct 09, Mon",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580109,"I found out today that the time I requested off for my section hike was approved. I will officially be hiking the Appalachian Trail between May and July next year. I have been researching a lot about gear and can now start thinking about buying what I need over the next few months. I have been slowly investing in ultra lightweight gear, this year I bought the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2 and love it. I could have went lighter but wanted to find the right balance for me between lightweight and comfort. I will likely post an entry in a couple of weeks on any gear I ended up purchasing.

Yesterday I went rock climbing at Cedar Point in Saint John. It felt nice to be outside, this October has been usually warm.  I had never been to this crag before, slab climbed or even rappelled, so there were a lot of firsts. I had to walk over a 30 meter cliff and rappel down, it was pretty scary considering a few months ago I would have never thought I would be rock climbing. Once I rappelled down I climbed back up and got a really nice view of the Saint John River. I bet not too many people get that view, not unless they climbed up that cliff. Sometimes the best views come from when you take on a little risk.",,View Entry,"Oct 30, Mon",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580207,"After many months of research, I finally purchased my Zpacks Arc Haul backpack! It was an expensive purchase but I heard a lot of good things about it. I also purchase the blue bear bag kit from Zpacks. The exchange rate was good so I figured it was a good time to buy, only thing is now winter is coming (yes a game of thrones joke) so I will have to wait until the spring to try out the gear. If anyone reading this journal has any suggestions for gear or past experience on thru hikes, I would be happy to hear some advice! So in September I wrote this big exam, I find out if I passed on Dec 1st. This three day exam was the end of a two year intense program. Part of doing this hike is a reward for all the time I spent focused on school and work and not on myself. I would like to think that I passed this exam but even if I don't it is what it is and the best I can do is try again. Even if I don't pass, I am still going through with my hike, because I still tried my best even if it isn't enough. I am waiting to book my flight to Atlanta until Dec 1st, no matter the outcome of that exam, it will still be a good day.",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Sat",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580667,"About a week and a half ago I hit my hand really hard off of a chair trying to catch my laptop from falling. Not quite sure exactly how I managed to do it but today I was finally able to take off the splint. Everything has been a little bit harder where I only have been able to use my left hand but I have been trying to make due. My hand is still in a bit of pain but nothing is broken so I am happy. The doctor suggested that I go to physiotherapy to help regain more movement and strength in my hand. Not being able to do any yoga or climbing over the last couple of weeks have been very difficult and has made me a bit sad, but I will have to find a way to keep myself busy and active until my hand has healed fully.
The days have been getting quite cool and windy over the last couple of weeks, I can tell winter is around the corner. Part of me is happy because every day that goes by is another day closer to the AT! I will have to get out the snow shoes this winter to get some hiking in, honestly I wouldn't be surprised if there is snow here in New Brunswick when I leave in May so my days of hiking in warmer weather are over until I fly out.  On a side note, my Zpacks Arc Haul has arrived in the mail, I am very excited. I haven't been able to check it all out yet because of the whole one hand thing but can't wait to look at all the features that it has. The hiking bag is significantly lighter than my current backpack and has a lot areas for customization.
 A lot of people have the mindset that you have to do the normal thing in life: go to school, work, get married, have kids and then retire and do all the things you want to do afterwards. Don't get me wrong, I believe in a balance, however I personally am not someone who wants to follow this traditional way that many people follow, I want to do some of these fun things now because who knows what will happen tomorrow? People think when others want to do something different from the traditional way, like take an extended time off work that they are going through some mid life crisis or have lost their mind. I may be almost 30 years old, but to this date I have spent most of my life focused on school and work. Over the years I have lost touch with the little things in life and had not realized until recently.  I want to get back to the basics and not over complicate life,  I want to enjoy nature and stop to smell the flowers, I want to focus on my well-being and give back, that is why I want to hike the AT.",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Sun",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580977,"Last Friday was one of the biggest days of my career, I found out that I passed the final exam to a program that I have been working through for many years. It's great to know that all my hard work finally paid off.
To celebrate passing my exam I decided to make a few purchases. I finally booked my one way flight to Atlanta for May 2nd. Not going to lie, it feels weird booking a one way flight. When I have gone on trips in the past I have always had a structured plan with a start and an end date. No matter how much I plan for this adventure on the AT, I know things will happen and it will not go as planned, which is scary but kind of exciting at the same time. I also booked my shuttle from the airport to Amicalola Falls State Park and my stay for the night at the lodge. Now I need to start thinking if I want to send out any mail drops along the trail, not really sure how expensive it will be to ship packages across the border to the US but I will have to do some research. Reality is sinking in that this hike is only a few months away!
I have heard a lot of different opinions from people about my upcoming hike. I find that people who I have talked to that are not as familiar with what long distance hiking is get nervous when you tell them what you are doing, especially when you tell them you are planning to do it alone. It's hard to explain to people that this is something I have thought through and planned for years. I know I can't be ready for everything that will be thrown my way, but I will do the best I can now to prepare for it. 

I really enjoy the trail journals community, it seems like everyone is very supportive and understand each other's sense of adventure.I appreciate all the kind words from people who have written in my guestbook so far, thank you for taking the time to wish me luck.",,View Entry,"Dec 04, Mon",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581350,"Back in October I attended a meditation workshop through the Amana Institute. I spent the weekend learning about how to practice meditation and about the science behind it. Going to the workshop I was a bit skeptical, I thought in order to meditate that you had to be thinking of nothing, which I thought was impossible. Even though I was skeptical, I decided to go anyway and give it a shot.  I quickly realized during the workshop that meditation is not so black and white, some days you will have sessions that are very relaxing and restorative whereas other times you will just want to jump off the cushion as fast as possible.  Each experience is different, the key is not to let those days where you feel like you didn't meditate as well discourage you.
I tried a couple different types of meditation: mantra meditation and another form where you keep your eyes open and focus on your breath (not exactly sure if this type has a name). I found the mantra meditation was best for me, being able to close my eyes, repeat my mantra in my head and slowly let the thoughts drift away. Each time I meditate, my mind goes to this one peaceful place that I hiked to a couple years ago: an isolated beach along the Bay of Fundy. Even though I am still having the thought of me sitting on that beach, I feel very relaxed and restored after my practice. Meditation has honestly changed my life. I think differently now, I don't sweat the small things, I don't bottle up stress, I think of the glass half full rather than half empty. 
As I say that I am now sit on my couch, looking out of the window at the snow and ice on the ground. The temperature is about -3 degrees celcius, which is pretty warm considering how cold it has been the last couple of weeks. I think I will do some meditation to remind myself of how warm it is in the summer.",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Wed",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581805,"Another year has come and gone, it's hard to believe how fast time goes by. 2017 was full of many adventures and changes to my life. In April, a friend of mine and I drove from New Brunswick to Harper's Ferry, WV to visit the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. We were supposed to go on a 41 mile hike from Pen Mar back to Harper's Ferry but I came down with a bad flu and unfortunately was not able to hit the trail. Instead we decided to do some sight seeing around the town. On our last night we camped at Crampton Gap Shelter, I was still not feeling great but I couldn't drive all that way to not spend a night on the AT. My friend and I arrived early at Crampton Gap and set up our tents and cooked our supper. Later on in the evening several other people arrived at the shelter and we all sat around the bonfire. One of the men said they had done a two month section hike starting from Springer Mountain a couple years before and told us a few stories. I could have listened to his stories all day, I heard everything from how he met someone who was hiking barefoot to how someone got the name privy creeper. It was a really fun time, and even though I was sick, the 30 hours of driving was completely worth it.
In the summer I decided to face my fear of heights and started rock climbing outdoors. I spent 2.5 months off work in the summer to study for the common final exam and passed. In August I went to Osheaga for the first time, a 3 day music and art festival held in Montreal. I was also fortunate enough to meet Ria Mae twice when she performed in New Brunswick, she also signed my vinyl! In October I switched into a different department at work and enrolled into a 3 year course. In October I was also introduced to meditation, which has since become an important part of my life. On top of all that I made the big jump and booked my flight to Atlanta!
I decided to spend the first day of the new year with back to back yoga classes. The first class was a hot yoga class and the second was a restorative/yoga nidra class. This year my goals are to focus on my mental and physical wellbeing. It's so easy to forget about it when you get busy, so this year I am going to try and be more aware of taking the time to relax and workout when I am feeling stressed or busy in my everyday life. Of course one of my goals is to do my section hike but I don't have any set distance I want to travel over the two and a half months that I will be gone. I don't want to miss things along the way because I was focused on getting in as many miles as possible. I plan on hiking my on hike and seeing where the trail takes me.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Mon",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581894,"So I mentioned before in a previous entry that I have a fear of heights. Back in 2014, my fear of heights got in the way of me reaching the summit of Mount Katahdin. It was around the beginning of September when my boyfriend and I decided to hike the Hunt Trail up Katahdin. I wanted to hike on the Hunt Trail because it was around this time that I became interested in hiking the Appalachian Trail and I wanted to see what it was all about. We hiked for a couple of hours until we reached above treeline, it was at this point I realized how high we were. I looked down (of course, exactly what I shouldn't have done) and started to have a mini panic attack but I kept going. I got to a point where I had to grab onto a bar drilled into the rock to pull myself up, where I would be then on a ledge to pull myself up again. Once I got to this point I couldn't go any further, I just froze. I felt bad for my boyfriend, I was too scared to keep going and he wanted to reach the top, we were so close. I decided that I could not continue and walked back down the mountain, I was so embarrassed, how am I supposed to hike the AT if I can't even hike my first 4 miles of it?
A few weeks later I decided I was going to go back and try to summit Katahdin by the Saddle Trail. It was about an 11 mile hike to the summit and back, but I managed to do it. The trail tested me both physically and mentally, there was a lot of rock scrambling and steep areas but not as bad as the Hunt Trail. After this hike I gained back some of my confidence and realized that the trail is not going to be any walk in the woods, I am going to be uncomfortable and test my limits. Now as part of my section hike I will have to summit Katahdin again, only this time via the Hunt Trail.

In the summer of 2016, my boyfriend and I decided to do a 42 mile hike along the AT from Franconia Ridge to Mount Washington. This hike was also another prep for my 2.5 month section hike this spring. During this hike I encountered a similar situation to what I experienced  before however this time on the Webster Cliffs Trail. On top of walking by cliffs (as the name suggests) and pulling myself up with rocks and tree roots, I was also trying to reach the Nauman Tentsite before a bad thunderstorm was supposed to hit. The last thing I wanted to do was be exposed above treeline at 4,000 ft, so we needed to find cover fast. I decided at that point I had to face my fear of heights, it would be worse for me to go back down the mountain and I didn't hike all that way to give up. I struggled but managed to rock scramble and hike through some questionable areas and set up camp at the tentsite about 10 minutes before the thunderstorm hit. I felt so proud of myself for not letting my fear get in the way.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Fri",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582152,"So Sunday I finally decided to start my video blog. In my first post I did say that I was only going to use trail journals to track my adventure but I changed my mind. I am overwhelmed with all the support I am getting from everyone, I really appreciate it. I was really nervous to post my first video, even more than my first entry here on TJ. I want to be transparent with my YouTube videos and posts on TJ, I'm not going to say the trail is easy or underestimate my pack weight, I am going to tell it as it is, the good and the bad. I purchased a StickPic, which I believe was used by Red Beard when he hiked the AT. It looks awesome, it's an attachment to the end of your hiking pole to make it like a selfie stick, I think that will make it easier for me to take a decent video or photo. When I get out on the trail I plan on using YouTube, Trail Journals and Instagram as my media platforms, however if I find that the videos take up too much of my time, I might cut back on them. I don't want to miss out on the beauty of the trail because I was so focused on capturing a video, so I will see how it goes. If you are interested in following my adventures though, I provided the information below:

I made an important purchase yesterday, I was on the fence about whether I wanted to buy a personal locator beacon (PLB) or satellite messenger, or anything at all. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer, I think it all comes down to what will make you feel better at the end of the day. I ended up purchasing the Delorme inReach SE two way communicator, it was more expensive than the Spot and about as much as some of the PLBs but I managed to get it on sale. I really like how I can pick a monthly plan rather than having to buy an annual subscription, plus I have unlimited messaging. I don't plan on using a lot of the messaging but the comfort of being able to hear from family will be nice. I also like that my family and friends can track me along the trail. Where I am going solo and don't do a lot of solo hiking, I thought this was the best option for me, peace of mind knowing that if something happens and I don't have cell reception, I can call for help on the inReach.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Tue",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582577,"Today marks 93 days until I head out on the approach trail. As far as it sounds it will go by quickly. I have to still buy clothes, some food and little things here and there but for the most part have what I plan to take on the hike. On Sunday I took a hike by myself, just a small one about 4km but it felt really good to get out. With the cold weather and snow, it's been really hard to get outside and test out the new gear. I hope to get back out again soon.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Tue",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583090,"Ok, maybe having a little fun with the title of this entry. I debated over and over the last few months, do I do mail drops or not? There are a couple downsides to me doing a mail drop, since I am from Canada, the shipping is going to cost more than shipping domestically within the US, and there are going to be duties on the package. I also will have to make sure that I plan my resupply days a little to make sure I arrive when the post office is open to collect my package.  I debated driving over the border before I left to mail my packages so it wouldn't be as costly but I would be spending more on gas to drive there than the shipping costs. The other option is for me to do mail drops while on the trail, that is definitely still an option but I think I will do a few in easy to access areas off the trail for simplicity for now. I don't want to do too many, because it will be costly and I also don't know what I am going to want to eat a few months down the road, I want to keep my options open. I read some journals and watched past thru hiker video blogs on suggested mail drop locations. I decided to follow Seven's advice (YouTube channel: Hiker Trash Video) and do the following drops: Neel Gap, the NOC and Fontana Dam. He suggested these locations because they are just off the trail and there may not be many food options as other locations. I think planning the mail drops will be good for me, it will help me pass the time before my hike and keep my mind occupied.
Trail Days is something that has also been on my mind, I want to go this year. Since I started video blogging about my hike, I have met a lot of other hikers online who will be on the trail this year.  I think Trail Days will be an awesome opportunity to meet them in person as I likely won't on the trail since I am leaving at the end of the bubble. I won't make it to Damascus before Trail Days so now I am trying to figure out the logistics of getting there. I am not sure exactly where I will be, I just know that it will be in an area that will not have many transportation options. I am thinking that a shuttle will work best, I am hoping that I will meet another hiker on the trail that will want to split on the shuttle costs as I will be quite a distance away from Damascus.
I want to say thank you to all for reading my journal and signing my guestbook, I do read all the comments and appreciate all your kind words. I am hoping once I am on the trail to have an entry for each day, however they will be lagged as I won't always have service.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584364,"It's been a few weeks since the last time I posted on trail journals, I have been a bit busy with getting last minute gear, work, school, things should be getting back to normal now though. Today is an exciting day, two people I know (the Hiking Sailor and Neil Livingstone) have just left on a plane headed to Atlanta. They start the AT tomorrow, I couldn't be more happy for them. It will be great to follow people who I know and watch their experiences along the way. They are thru hiking this year so I will likely still be able to follow their adventure when I am back from my section hike. If you are interested in following them on their adventure, I have provided a link to their YouTube channels below:The Hiking Sailor on the AT 2018: https://www.youtube.com/channe...Neil Livingstone: https://www.youtube.com/channe...I am very excited to get on the trail, I have watched so many others start so far this year. A few of them are off the trail due to injury, I wish them all a speedy recovery and that they continue to follow their dream of hiking the AT. Yesterday I bought a pair of CurrexSole RunPro High Arc insoles for my Merrell Moab Ventilator Low Cut hiking shoes, they fit very well with my feet. I have wide feet so I figured it would be difficult to find the right insole but the Currex fit better than the Superfeet that I tried on. I also bought a polyester t-shirt and nylon hiking shorts, I probably tried on ten different pieces of clothing before I found ones with a good feel and fit. I still need to buy more clothes, food, a knife and send out my mail drops but besides that I am basically done. I think next Saturday I will do a video on my gear. I have less than 50 days before I hit the trail, every day I get more excited. My approved leave is from May 1st to August 6th, I don't know what day I will be getting off the trail just yet but I would like to have a couple of weeks with family and friends before I head back to work. While I am on the trail my boyfriend is going to post my trail journals for me, it was very nice of him to agree to take the time out of his day to do that for me while I am away.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
Jessica Doucet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588656,"It's been forever since I have posted an entry, life has been crazy with getting all the last minute things sorted out before hitting the trail. The exciting thing is that I fly out to Atlanta tomorrow, this is finally starting to become a reality and I couldn't be more excited. Yea I feel a little nervous, I mean this is something completely different than anything I have ever done before. I have never been away from home longer than a little over 2 weeks, or have been on the trail for so long. I have made the decision that going forward I will mainly use youtube to blog my hike, I don't want to use too many platforms and then not be able to focus on the trail itself. In saying that I will post on trail journals every so often, just not as frequently as originally planned. If you do want to follow my youtube channel for more frequent updates of my adventure my username is: Jessica ontheAT Next entry will be on trail!",,View Entry,"May 01, Tue",0
