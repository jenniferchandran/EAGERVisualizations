One of the hardest things is to get to a place where you can just let go and live your best life, one full of purpose, void of the meaningless daily grind. I’m making my dream happen by hiking the length of the Appalachian Trail (AT) in my father’s memory and to honor those still fighting ALS.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Thu",0
Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582809,"Hey Everybody, Welcome to my AT journal. I'm happy you will be following along with me on my journey. I will be attempting to hike from end to end of the Appalachian Trail starting on the approach trail in Georgia heading northbound to the northern terminus Mt Katahdin in Maine. I will, phone signal permitting, be posting daily on my trail conditions, weather, nature sightings, plans for the following day's hike, a wrap up of the how the day went, and finally some of my thoughts of the day. Of course I'm super excited to start this new chapter in my life and hope you all are as excited to follow along. I'll do my best to not disappoint but guarantee nothing:)  There is a guestbook you can sign in at and a comment section that you can ask questions or just throw some positive thoughts my way. Can't wait to start! Thanks all!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sat",0
Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582850,"Less than 2 weeks before I leave for my 6 month journey on the Appalachian trail and I'm thinking, is everything ready?   After more than 18 months of researching, testing gear, planning, training, and lightening my pack weight it already has been quite an adventure.  I've weighed every item at least ten times, packed and repacked more times than i can count getting my pack weight down just a little bit each time. I ask myself ""will this feel heavy after a week or two... a month or two?"" Maybe not but if it was lighter I'd probably be more comfortable in turn enjoying more of my time out there. So I have questioned every item asking ""is this piece of gear going to help me get to Katahdin? Or just weigh me down? I've heard it takes approximately 5 million steps to complete the AT (trail steps). Do i really need all of this stuff. This battle I've had has gone on for months until I was finally happy with a winter start base weight of approx. 15 lbs. Base weight is my pack and everything in it except for the variables; food, water and fuel. I'll find out soon enough if i really ""need"" all of this stuff. I keep having to remind myself to just live simply and everything will work out.   Am I ready for everything the trail will throw my way? I'd like to think mentally and physically I'm as ready as I'll ever be. While at the same time i don't think I want to be ready for every surprise nor do I think anyone is truly 100% ready for everything.  For me that's all part of the magic that a  long distance trek like the AT provides.  I do know by being confident in my skills and willing to adapt to any conditions I may encounter combined with a positive outlook and I'm good to go.     So am I ready?...",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sat",0
Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583124,"What a day today! After one last run through my gear and very little sleep we were on the road to Knoxville to stay the night before heading to Georgia Wednesday morning. Within 10 min of leaving i asked myself “what did I leave behind?”  It rained steadily for the first 3 hrs of the drive then cleared in time to catch a faint silhouette of the Smoky mountains before arriving in Knoxville. Joe & I took a short walk through the neighborhood down to a small park along the Tennessee river to kill some time and take in some views around town. I’m digging Knoxville so far we saw 3 hangers (hammock hangers) in the park practically hanging over the rivers edge enjoying the unseasonably warm day. Erin & Scott have so graciously opened up there home for Joe & I to crash in before heading out in the morning. Erin, Joe & I hit the town for some pub & grub at an excellent brewery just down the street in just north Knoxville where Scott later joined. We enjoyed delicious brews & excellent food on the patio before taking a stroll through worlds fair park. Gotta hit the hay, tomorrow is a big day.  Thank you Erin & Scott you guys are awesome!!!  Has anybody seen my sunglasses??",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Tue",0
Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583241,"My first entry didn’t go so well, not me just the trail journals site maybe.  I had a great first day as you’ll read in a minute. Here’s what happened to my first time trying to add an entry from the top of a mountain. 
As I got tucked in for the night & typed on my phone I thought “this is pretty cool, I can lay here in my hammock write in my journal & immediately send it off for everyone to read about my experiences or at least get a good laugh.”  After writing & doing a quick proofreading all of my memories for the day I hit “Add Entry” & then POOF it all disappeared:(  Apparently that happens on this site maybe bc of a poor signal but who knows. No worries tho.  ( I’ve got a new process set up for posting entries (thanks to suds & subman) & I’ll try to get caught up soon enough) So it took a couple days to gather those thoughts & feelings as I hiked north. So here it is a little late but better than never.  
DAY 1 AMICALOLA FALLS STATE PARK VISITORS CENTER TO SPRINGER MTN SHELTER VIA THE APPROACH TRAIL

8.8mi approach trail. .2mi Appalachian Trail
Joe & I left Knoxville in a hurry to get to Amicalola State Park as the visitor center opened at 9am. Weather & traffic would prevent that from happening as well one not so ready hiker that morning. No biggie tho I’m not in a rush these days:) we arrived at the park approximately 10:30 am & I officially registered my thru hike (#244) & weighed my pack as instructed. 34lbs!!! How did that happen!? When I left St. Louis everything was packed & weighed 28.7lbs just where I wanted it, under 30. I had a sneaking suspicion Erin & Scott may have slipped in a couple of rocks just for sh%ts & giggles:) Nevertheless I was too excited to get on trail & start my adventure so out the back door I went to get a pic under the famous stone archway symbolizing the start of the approach trail. FYI the approach trail is a 8.8 mi STEEP climb up the south side of Springer Mtn. Within it is a 600+ step staircase following the waterfall on the west side to to the top (I was actually pumped to do that part) but as luck would have it the stairs were closed due to a washout of the supports from the insane amount of rain Georgia has had lately:( So as instructed I took the east trail to the top of the falls where it joins with the stairs. Joe had said he wanted to at least go to the top of the falls & despite the rainy, foggy, muddy slog it turned out to be he never looked back. My cousin Joe is freakin awesome & I’m so thankful for him driving me all the way down here. At the top oc the falls I snapped some pics said goodbye & turned to the bathroom in the parking lot to take one last good look at myself. That’s when I noticed my shirt, or I should say shirts. In my eagerness to get this started i booked it out the door wearing a cotton blend t shirt (one of my favorites too) & after situating my pack I found the extra weight. Most of the road trip food I picked up along the way along with a large ziplock bag of my favorite chocolate chip cookies (Fanks Kerka) 4 tangerines&  2 apples. Plus more water than I needed. No worries tho I ate as much of the food as I could saving only a couple cookies & drinking the extra water. Perfect. Now I just had to ditch the extra shirt & I was good. Side note: cotton anything isn’t a good choice for a cold weather backpacking trip as it absorbs a lot of moisture & takes forever to dry.  
Out the bathroom door & back into the rain I trudged along, of was so foggy I couldn’t see more than 10ft it the trail which wasn’t the worst thing mainly bc then i wouldn’t worry about the future & could just stay in the now. About 1.5mi in I met my first thru hiker, Marty. Marty was a rather portly man with a monstrously huge pack strapped to his back. He wasn’t having a good go at his thru hike attempt & was resting on a log as I approached. I asked if he was ok & he told me this was his day 2 & he was heading back down to re evaluate his choices. As he told me his pack was a whooping 51lbs he lost balance & hit the ground. I helped him up & offered to carry his pack back down the the top of the falls but he wouldn’t have it. I can understand stubbornness believe me. Anyhow I told him that I was going to at least follow him down just in case.I’ve heard of a saying about the AT that goes “what goes down must go back up” so there I was heading back up the approach. The rain started & stopped nearly every five minutes so I’d throw on my rain jacket just as it would stop. Pretty sure Mother Nature or someone was having a barrel of laughs looking down at me putting on & taking off my rain jacket at least 20 times before finally giving in, embracing the situation & continuing north. Whoever it was, they won but I didn’t think it was funny at all. I definitely expected it tho.  
Upon reaching the top of Springer some 6 hrs later I touched the plaque signed the register & took some pics of myself next to the first white blaze signifying the actual start of the Appalachian Trail. 
 

I know not everyone attempting a thru hike goes up the approach trail. It doesn’t count for AT mileage & it’s pretty tough. There’s actually a road that goes to the top of Springer. I didn’t care. I’m in it for the adventure & to me that’s all part of it. 
On top of Springer clouds continue to roll through & I hiked the .2mi to the shelter to hang my hammock nearby for the night. I met some other aspiring thru hikers, cooked dinner & hit the hay. 
Plans for tmrw are to hike 14.1 to Justus creek campsite if all goes well. Even tho I didn’t make it as far as I wanted to today I’m marking it a win. Tmrw is another day of new trail & new sights. Hope I can get some sleep with the lumberjack next door sounding like he’s in a log sawing competition.

Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583242,"Well Mother Nature must have had enough laughs yesterday & decided to cut us a break with a beautiful day today. Upon waking up at Springer Mountain shelter area we still had clouds rolling through dropping light rain. Even though I had hung everything under my tarp to dry, the clouds rolled through under it & continued to soak it all. Not complaining tho, still no place I’d rather be. Cooked breakfast which consisted of oatmeal, cream of wheat & strawberries I dehydrated at home. Oh & of course coffee! Packed up camp & headed northbound. 4 mi in I took my first side trail to Long creek falls as it was a highly suggested detour not to miss. It absolutely was worth the extra .5 slog down the ravine! I could feel the pounding of the rushing water over the falls in my chest & sat to have a lil snack & take a couple pics. Climbing out of the ravine I met an older guy cruising past. I asked “ is this the way to Katahdin?” pointing up the trail.  His reply “I hope so”.  His name is Dane aka OG- old guy:) he’s a slender man with hair & a beard as white as snow. We talked as we walked along & he told me he’s 70 & just decided to drive out on a whim & see how far he could make it up the trail. I thought I was in decent shape but this guy is an animal! Dane not only kept my pace but pushed me to try to keep up! We hiked together the rest of the day even when I thought of stopping Dane insisted we do one more steep ascent up Sassafras mountain & set up camp on the north side. Well we did & am glad bc it puts me back on track to put me in Neels gap to re supply early sat morn. On the other side of sassafras there was a young lady trail name Snap who thru hiked last year. She was set up at Cooper gap doing trail magic, of course I  accepted the generous offer & opportunity to have fresh veggies & hummus while listening to stories of her hike. THANK YOU SNAP! She completed her hike in less than 5 months & had the time of her life. I had just enough time to set up camp before dark & get tucked in after a great day on the trail. There’s a 40% chance of rain tonight but goes down to 20% tmrw. Temps have been unseasonably warm in the 60s & will continue to be for a little while. 
Plans for tmrw are to do  another 12 mi day to Lance creek campsite with a couple steep climbs. This will set me up for an easier 7.6 mi day into Neels gap & mountain crossings outfitter & hostel on sat morning. The ATC doesn’t believe in switchbacks so most climbs are nearly straight up the mountainside. 
People have been so friendly so far. Going to sleep now with the sounds of a creek gurgling nearby & the wind whistling through the barren trees. Life is good!","Springer Mountain

Sour Kraut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583274,"I can’t believe I forgot to tell you all about “Colonel” from yesterday so this first part is an addition to day 2. 
As OG & I hiked down into Coopers gap we saw Snap with the huge spread of trail magic in the form of delicious foods & snacks laid out on the side of the gravel road. There was everything from fresh fruit & veggies to Krispy Kreme’s, the lady brought everything a hiker could possibly be craving. She would know. But back to Colonel, Snap was doing a pack shakedown for him right there on the side of the road ( basically dumping everything out of the pack & going through it one piece at a time & suggesting things he could leave behind or send home thus lightening the total pack weight). She must have seen him struggling coming down Sassafras mtn. While Snap was doing this Colonel pulls out his paper maps he’d been using for guidance. Snap looks at him & says “dang, that’s old school” therefore giving him his first trail name. Now I’ll just say that Snap is a incredibly generous person with a huge heart that absolutely loves the trail & the hikers on it & I’m very thankful we met her. But later that evening as we sat around & talked I learned of “old schools” background & felt the name didn’t really fit the man. You see “old school” is a 65 yr old retired Army Colonel, that’s right, one step below the highest rank of General! The man devoted 30 yrs to the service of our country I had a hard time calling him “old school.” I was glad to find out I wasn’t the only one that felt that he deserved more respect, don’t get me wrong the guy is carrying old school maps, but it just didn’t feel right. After a short discussion with OG we agreed to rename old school. That day “Colonel” was born. On to actual day 3. 
The evening before day 3 OG, Colonel & I agreed to get an earlier start than I usually do. We were up, packed, & had breakfast & on trail by 7:30. OG was out in front followed by myself then Colonel. First climb was Justus Mtn, a steep short half mile ascent. Colonel was getting comfortable with his lighter pack thanks to Snaps help. We’d hike our own pace throughout the day occasionally taking breaks for water & snacks usually at or near the shelters as they  usually have a blue blazed side trail near them leading to a known good water source and of course the privy (so much easier than having to dig a hole on the rocky mountainsides). Our first stop was Gooch Mtn shelter, OG & I watered up & sat down for a quick lunch as Colonel strolled in grinning from ear to ear so happy with his lighter backpack. OG pushed on to shoot some videos as he hiked & I stayed to chat with Colonel. I helped Colonel get his pack fitting a lil better & we rambled on down the trail. The weather for the day wasn’t the greatest with low clouds/fog preventing an decent views but that didn’t bother me. I knew everyday wasn’t going to be perfect. Throughout the day I’d see day & section hikers every couple miles or so doing their own thing having fun for the most part. No views from the top of Preaching Rock but I did have a good cell signal & decided to make some calls just to share my excitement. I figured it was probably a lil early on in my hike to be calling family but I couldn’t resist & everyone was happy to hear from me & seemed just as excited:) At this point another thru hiker had reached the summit but wasn’t having such a good time. I believe his name was Travis. Travis looked like he had a golf ball in the side of his mouth. He explained he had an abscess tooth going on & I thought it’s  a bad time for that right here right now. He said when his heart rate increased from the climbs his whole head would just painfully throb. I felt bad for him & offered some Vitamin I which he gladly accepted, wished him the best & carried on my way. 
Today I was pretty much grinning from ear to ear just because. My legs felt good, sore yes, but still good. No feet problems whatsoever & even a lil emotional at times. I think it started to hit me “ I’m really doing this & I’m feeling really good.” 
OG, Colonel & I decided to meet at Lance creek campsite tonight as we all agree the shelters are not for us. OG & Colonel pitched their tents on the tent pads & I headed uphill to hang for the night. Met two more thru hikers staying nearby, Gabriel from Florida & Jeremy from Michigan. Dinner was instant garlic mashed potatoes & browned spam w/ sriracha.  Mmmm...powerfully good:) Going to sleep good tonight.
The weather for tmrw looks similar to today with rain overnight then on& off all day w/ temps in the low 60’s. 
Plan for tmrw is to get to Neel Gap & should arrive just in time for their AT kickoff party at the Mountain Crossings outfitter. I heard there will be free food!!! I also sent my first resupply box there (more food!) It will be a big day as I’ll summit Blood Mtn at 4500’ the highest peak in GA on the trail & see the oldest shelter on the trail as well. The shelter is a stone structure built in 1937 I believe. I’ve heard stories of why it’s called Blood Mtn all varied a little but similar in that there was a battle between Indian tribes so fierce and destructive that all the mountainsides were covered in blood. Can’t wait! 
Lastly I want to thank all of you for the kind thoughts & encouragement as I take on this endeavor. I’m sure most of you, if not all, know this isn’t going to be easy physically or mentally & wanted you to know I’m seeing the comments & they help soooo much. I’m not exactly sure how to respond to you individually so for now I’ll try this. 
Hummingbird, thank you & good luck on your upcoming hike. 
Cozy, thank you & love you too!
Chris S., A grouchy drunken German, I love it!
Jeannine, Thank you & I’m keeping calm & heading north. 
Mark in Texas thanks! 
Tim in Virginia, I’m glad you picked my journal to follow this year, thanks. 
THANKS ALL. Goodnight. Life is good!
