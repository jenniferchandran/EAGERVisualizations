Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593146,"We arrived in Millinocket, Maine yesterday around 4pm. It was a long drive from Ohio. We decided to postpone summitting Katahdin one day to avoid rain and cold temperatures. I am a little disappointed and frustrated to have our schedule messed up before we even start, but that’s the trail I guess! We are just hanging around town for the day and staying at the Appalachian Trail Lodge for the night. They will shuttle us to Baxter State Park in the morning and we will officially start hiking! Planning for ten days of hiking before we reach Monson, Maine at the end of the 100 mile wilderness. Going to be the longest section we go without a town stop. The people here at the AT Lodge are going to drop off some food for us about halfway through the 100 miles, though, which will be very helpful in keeping our pack weights down. Looking forward to a nice day tomorrow for the summit!","

Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594577,"Officially started the hike today. First challenge: Katahdin. Of course it was still  rainy, even though we waited an extra day. Oh well, up we go! It was cold and foggy and rainy all the way up. The hike really wasn’t too bad to start out with. We hiked up to the falls and then up to the tree line. Once we got up what is called The Gateway, is when things got tough. The constant rain made the rocks very very slippery. It’s at this point that the trail is less of a trail and more of a rock climb/scramble up to the top. They even have metal handholds and bars that you use to climb up. They were all so slippery. We were climbing up these rock cliffs basically into a cloud. We couldn’t see anything above us or below us. As a matter of safety, we ended up turning around before getting to the summit. It was terrifying to be on the edge of a cliff on a mountain 5000 feet up, and not be able to see or get a solid handhold or foot hold. Nearly everyone we encountered on the mountain turned around the same place that we did. It was just too dangerous. So unfortunately, no summit picture for us. We will just have to come back another time and finish it.","Millinocket, ME

Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594580,"Today we had to hike all the way out of the state park (about ten miles), and then three more miles to the first shelter in the 100 mile wilderness. We had beautiful weather for the hike today! Sunshine all day and a good breeze. The hike out of the park was very easy with almost no elevation change. We hiked alongside the most beautiful stream for a good portion of the day. We saw a grouse today! We had to hike a little more than initially planned to find a good spot to set up the tent. It was a long day. We were both exhausted by the end of it, and starting to get a blister... it started raining around 6 and rained steadily through the night, but we were dry in the tent.","Katahdin Stream Campground
",Hurd Brook Lean to,"Jun 07, Thu",13.40
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594582,"Today was a tough day. I woke up to my bad knee beginning to hurt, and a nasty blister. This resulted in a very decreased hiking pace. We hiked over rainbow ridge and saw a nice view of Katahdin. Then we stopped about 8 miles in at Rainbow Stream Campground and took a long break. We were going to camp there because I was so exhausted from hiking with a hurting knee, but we both decided that it would be better for us in the long run to try to push the last couple miles to get to the lean to. So I wrapped up my knee and took some ibuprophen and we powered through. It was so rewarding to come down the hill and see the lean to. It is right next to a cool stream. We had a campfire to try to ward off the mosquitos and made dinner and went to bed.","Hurd Brook Lean to
",Rainbow Stream Lean to,"Jun 08, Fri",11.50
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594645,"We had a long and tiring day today. The weather was beautiful and the trail didn’t look like it was going to be too tough, but it ended up being pretty difficult. We climbed up the Nesuntabunt Mountain, where we saw a nice view of Katahdin. The hike today consisted of a lot of climbing over boulders and watching your step carefully over root masses and rocks. We didn’t end up making it quite to the campsite that we intended to get to, because our feet and legs were so tired by the end of the day. However, we are still ahead of our original schedule! Hoping for an easier day tomorrow.","Rainbow Stream Lean to
",Nahmakanta Stream Campsite,"Jun 09, Sat",14
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594646,"Decided to really push ourselves today and ended up getting an entire day ahead of schedule! Which is great because the second half of the wilderness is going to be a lot tougher and we want to be able to take our time more during that. We had amazing weather again today. The trail was actually pretty easy- nice and mainly flat, not a lot of climbing over roots and rocks. We needed a good day like today to get ahead of our schedule and even though it was a lot of miles, it gave our feet a little bit of a break because the trail was easier. Our food resupply is going to be ready tomorrow!","Nahmakanta Stream Campsite
",Coopers Brook Falls Lean to,"Jun 10, Sun",16
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594930,"We fought majorly against the mosquitos today- it was hot and humid and they were out in force. Well, we made it to the shelter. It was a long and tough day with lots of ups and downs. Tomorrow looks like it will be worse, possibly one of the hardest days of the 100MW. We are about halfway up White Cap Mountain right now at the shelter and going the rest of the way up and down it tomorrow. Not having so much fun so far... it kind of seems more like work to try to make the miles everyday and push ourselves and less like a fun hiking trip where we get to enjoy the scenery and the location. Hopefully we can get through it and find some new motivation. Had an amazing dinner tonight of Mac and cheese, bacon bits, and goldfish crackers- yum! It’ll be good fuel for our climbs tomorrow.","Coopers Brook Falls Lean to
",Logan Brook Lean to,"Jun 11, Mon",11.70
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594931,"Wow today was tough. Even though we did significantly less miles, they were some tough ones. We had a lot of elevation gain and loss over short distances, which means the trail was super steep the whole way. The near vertical downhills really killed our feet and knees. They were probably the toughest part. We started out by summitting White Cap and got an amazing and panoramic view of the surrounding mountains, including Katahdin. Then we went up and over the next three mountains: Hay Mountain, West Peak, and Gulf Hagas Mountain. We met a lot of northbounders today who were so excited to be near the end of their hike. They are doing like 20-30 miles days- so crazy!! I guess you are pretty in shape once you hike all the way from Georgia to Maine in only 4 months. Had another awesome dinner tonight of mashed potatoes, stuffing, and chicken. Only 3 and a half more days until Monson!","Logan Brook Lean to
",Carl Newhall Lean to,"Jun 12, Tue",7.40
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594932,"Chairback Mountain was by far the hardest part of the trail so far. It featured a very steep uphill trail which turned into a false summit, then a pretty much vertical rock climb to the real summit. Literally rock climb- like we should have had ropes and harnesses, etc. It was intense and we were not prepared to do that at the end of our day. We made it though! And not only was the trail hard, but it was so sunny and hot and our campsite didn’t have a source of water.... it was tough. Other than chairback, we had our first real ford today where we had to take our shoes off and wade across the river. It was actually really refreshing and made our feet feel wonderful. Hoping it rains tonight!","Carl Newhall Lean to
",Chair back Gap Lean to,"Jun 13, Wed",9.90
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594933,"Today was full of ups and downs. We did five mountains today!!! The first was Columbus Mountain, nothing huge or spectacular. Next was Third Mountain, which was a little more involved. We though we were at the summit like three times but ended up continuing upward. Next was Mount three and a half, which was just a small mountain, only slightly higher than Third. The next one was Fourth Mountain (yeah they are really creative with the names...) which was not so fun. It was a very vertical uphill and then even steeper downhill! The last Mountain was Barren Mountain, which was the biggest of them all. We had an awesome view from it, but the vertical downhill afterward was not worth it, in my opinion. It was foggy and rainy all day, but at least it was cooler out, unlike yesterday’s heat. It was definitely the hardest day so far, but we are so close to being done with this section!!","Chair back Gap Lean to
",Long Pond Stream Lean to,"Jun 14, Thu",10.90
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594934,"Today was not so difficult, but we are so exhausted that it still took a long time to get our miles in. We had a lot of small ups and downs which really start to add up throughout the day. We had a few Stream fords today where we got a little wet (I fell in trying to cross one of them and got wet up to my waist..oops) but we managed to get across them. Otherwise, nothing very notable today. Only three or so more miles to do tomorrow and we are out of here!! We hit the 100 mile mark early today, which is a great accomplishment!","Long Pond Stream Lean to
",Leeman Brook Lean to,"Jun 15, Fri",12.10
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594935,"We are done with the 100 mile wilderness! And it kicked our butts! But at least we made it (: only did 3 miles today which weren’t too bad. They would have been super easy if we weren’t so exhausted, but they really were not bad. Nothing notable, really. Made it to the trailhead about 8am and headed into town. We showered and did laundry at Lakeshore House in Monson. It is a really nice place, if we were sticking to the trail here in Maine, we would definitely spend a day here to enjoy the town. We definitely want to come back to Monson at some point. We are headed to Bangor tonight and catching a Greyhound Bus in the morning to head to the Smoky Mountains for vacation, rest, and to figure out what we want to hike next.","Leeman Brook Lean to
","Monson, ME","Jun 16, Sat",3
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595446,"Got dropped off this morning at Green Corner Rd, and restarted our hike! It was mainly uphill today- climbing up Snowbird Mountain, but the trail is so much easier!! There are no huge rocks or roots to climb over, there are tons of fallen trees over the trail, plus there are switchbacks! We had a really short day of hiking at got to the shelter around 1:30. We just hung out and relaxed a bit. The rhododendrons are still in bloom here, and they are very pretty. Also, the shelter has bear cables so we don’t have to hang our own bear bag- amazing. Gonna set the tent up tonight because there are some really nice flat spots. It was rainy this morning, but got nice and sunny (and too hot) in the afternoon. Hopefully it doesn’t rain tonight!","Green Corner Rd
",Groundhog Creek Shelter,"Jun 23, Sat",6.90
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595449,"It’s been a really rainy day. We got a late start this morning because it was raining. We just stayed in the tent until it let up a bit. The weather was fine for a while, then started pouring on us while we hiked up to Max Patch. It was a cloudy and foggy view from the top. It’s a cool mountain though, because it is basically a grassy field. We definitely want to come back and hike it again when it isn’t rainy. I saw lots of my worst enemy today- poison ivy. Going to have to watch out for that. We heard lots of thunder (but no rain yet) this evening, so we are staying in the shelter.","Groundhog Creek Shelter
",Roaring Fork Shelter,"Jun 24, Sun",8.30
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595453,"Wow it was a long day. We hiked a lot more than initially intended, but we finally made it to the shelter. We wanted to stop a couple miles back, but there were no good camp spots with a water source, so we pushed on. We are really tired. We decided to tent tonight, even though we have heard a lot of thunder. It hasn’t rained yet though. Looking forward to a short hike out to the town tomorrow.","Roaring Fork Shelter
",Deer Park Mountain Shelter,"Jun 25, Mon",14.70
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595454,"We hiked a relatively easy 3 miles or so and made it to the hostel! It’s not a bad place, and pretty cheap too. Got our showers in and laundry and ate lunch and dinner at a little tavern/restaurant in town. Got our food resupply done at the Dollar General! We decided that we want to come back to this town at some point to do the mineral water hot tub at the Hot Springs Spa and so we can buy some of the awesome shirts and stickers they have at the Bluff Mountain Outfitters. Back on the trail tomorrow for the next section to Sam’s Gap!","Deer Park Mountain Shelter
",Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge,"Jun 26, Tue",3.20
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595927,"Today was not so fun. It was beautiful weather this morning... until lunch time. Then it started thudnerstorming and down pouring on us. The rain would let up a little bit for like fifteen minutes, and then start down pouring again. That happened several times. We ended up hiking extra than we planned just so we could get to the shelter where we could be dry for a little bit. The hike today was mainly uphill.. what a way to start hiking again after being in town. We just did not enjoy today. Hopefully the rest of the week is better!","Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge
",Spring Mountain Shelter,"Jun 27, Wed",11.40
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595928,"It really stormed last night/ early this morning. The lighting sounded so close to us. The rain let up around 10 and we got a late start to the day. It’s just been cloudy the rest of the day, hopefully it doesn’t rain. The hike today wasn’t too bad, but wasn’t all that great either. Started with a big downhill in the morning and followed by a big uphill in the afternoon, of course. The trail was just so wet and muddy and flooded in places. We have to hang a bear bag for the first time during this section tonight because the bear cables at the shelter are broken and squirrels can get into your food bag. We tried to get some of our stuff dried out today, but didn’t have much success because it wasn’t sunny.","Spring Mountain Shelter
",Little Laurel Shelter,"Jun 28, Thu",8.60
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595929,"Finally, we had a beautiful day. The skies were clear and the sun was out (it was maybe a little too hot for our liking). We climbed three mountains: Camp Creek Bald, Firescald knob, and Big Butt Mountain. We got really nice views at various spots going up and down Firescald Knob. It was a tough day, but not the worst. We stopped at Jerry’s Cabin Shelter and had a two hour break for lunch before hiking a couple extra miles just to get ahead. We found a campsite a couple miles after the shelter and made camp there. The bugs are terrible though. There are flies, black flies, and gnats. Constant buzzing.","Little Laurel Shelter
",Campsite a half mile S of Shelton Graves,"Jun 29, Fri",10.60
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595931,"Today was probably the hardest day we have had so far during this section. The first 6 miles or so were fine. They were flat and downhill, so we went pretty fast. However, the last 6 were a steep uphill and we went pretty slow. The climb up Lick Rock Mountain was very steep, probably the hardest one so far since we started hiking north. It also didn’t help that is was super hot out today and the bugs were a constant annoyance. We are looking forward to some rest at the hostel tomorrow!","Campsite a half mile S of Shelton Graves
",Hogback Ridge Shelter,"Jun 30, Sat",12.20
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595933,"We have only heard good things about this hostel, so we are very excited to stop here. We got in around 10:30 or so this morning, after a relatively easy couple miles down from the shelter. Our cabin is just one room with a bunk bed- queen bed on bottom and twin bed on top. It has an awesome screened in front porch overlooking the creek, and a picnic table with a fire pit in the back. The showers were amazing!! We are just chilling for the rest of the day and we start the next section tomorrow. Only two more days until we get to Erwin, TN.","Hogback Ridge Shelter
",Nature’s Inn Hostel,"Jul 01, Sun",2.40
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596345,"The bed at the hostel last night was so comfy, I did not want to get up and go hike. Over 6 miles of the 7.7 that we did today were uphill, to the top of Big Bald. We decided to do less miles today than planned so we could just stay at the shelter. We will pick up the miles tomorrow and do more. The climb up today was tough. It was long and steep in some places. It was also very hot out... but the views from the top were awesome. We had an almost 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains from the top. I did fall twice today and have a really nice bruise to show for it. We are ready for a rest day.","Nature’s Inn Hostel
",Bald Mountain Shelter,"Jul 02, Mon",7.70
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596346,"We had kind of a boring hike today. It was mainly downhill, but did have a few tough uphills. The main thing is that it was super hot out. We had to take several long breaks, especially after the uphills, to cool down and not overheat. Not much exciting in the way of landforms or anything although we did see a lot of hummingbirds for some reason! In other news, last night our tent broke. One of the poles just randomly snapped in half. So we ended up tying the tent up with a tree branch to keep it up and kind of wrapping the rain fly around it so that we could sleep in it for the night. We are staying in the shelter tonight and hopefully we can get a repair kit when we get to Erwin!","Bald Mountain Shelter
",No Business Shelter,"Jul 03, Tue",10.60
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596350,"We made it to Erwin! The hostel is not too bad, could use a little cleaning up and organization, but it is better than the woods! We got here in time to get a shower, do laundry, had lunch at a pizza buffet, and go to Walmart and get our resupply done. They had a tent pole repair kit at the outfitter store, and we think it will work, at least for the time being. It is the Fourth of July, and the people who work here put on a cook out for dinner. We had hamburgers, hotdogs, potato salad, etc. It was awesome! Going to take a zero day tomorrow and maybe check out the swimming hole in the river. And then it is onward to Roan Mountain!","No Business Shelter
",Uncle Johnny’s Hostel,"Jul 04, Wed",6.20
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596809,"We left the hostel a little before 10am and started our next leg of our hike. Thunderstorms were in the forecast. We decided to hike up about 4 miles to the first shelter and then stay there. Well we got to the shelter, called Curley Maple Gap Shelter, and sat there for a couple hours. We made water. It had not started raining yet and we were considering hiking a couple more miles to a tentsite when we saw the largest spider I have ever seen. This thing was just sitting on the wall, not frightened when we banged against the wall or shined our light on it. It was huge, about the size of a playing card and black. So we decided to pack up and head about 2 more miles up the trail to a tenting site. We made it to the site just before the thunderstorm started. We are going to try to make up the miles we didn’t do today, tomorrow and get back on track.","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel
",Tentsite 1.3 miles S of Indian Grave Gap,"Jul 06, Fri",6.60
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596810,"We had a long, tough day today playing catch up. We went up and over Beauty Spot and Unaka Mountain. It was cloudy and foggy so we didn’t get good views from the top, but the temperature was down which was nice! Ultimately, it was not a very exciting day. But we are caught up to our schedule now! It’s also our 1 year and 11 month anniversary of dating. We celebrated by going to bed early!","Tentsite 1.3 miles S of Indian Grave Gap
",Cherry Gap Shelter,"Jul 07, Sat",10.60
Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596811,"Well, we hiked more than planned today to hopefully make tomorrow easier. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow with Roan Mountain, so going a couple miles extra is going to be beneficial. The hike today was mostly just boring. A lot of PUDs — pointless ups and downs. The sun was shining all day, but thankfully it never got too unbearably hot. There were lots of flies today, though. We saw a bear print in the mud and a few orange newts which was cool! We went about 3 miles extra today and our legs are tired.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596812,"We pushed it to get to the barn shelter tonight (and old barn converted into a hiker shelter)!! We did Roan Mountain, Round Bald, Jane Bald, and Grassy Ridge Bald. It was a long day, but the views made the climb so worth it. It was probably my favorite day of hiking so far. And the climbs didn’t seem to be that bad. It could be that we finally ate enough calories for dinner last night, but it was a good day and we didn’t have too much trouble going the extra few miles. There are a lot of people at the shelter tonight, it is a really popular one. But the stars are really nice out here! I think we are going to hike into the hostel tomorrow, a day early.","Tentsite 0.7 miles S of Hughes Gap

Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596814,"The hike today was not too tough. We were able to get the distance in to get to the hostel in the early afternoon. We started out by climbing up Little Hump Mountain. We got some nice views on the way up and from the top. We then climbed up (big) Hump Mountain. It was cloudy most of the morning and as we went higher in elevation, we got more into the clouds. So the view at the top was mostly just clouds, but it was cool. It was very very windy on the hike up. After the summit, we hiked across the Houston Ridge, which is about a mile long exposed ridge. We both really loved the hike across that. It was so cool to just be walking in basically a field, with no trees, for a few miles up the humps and the ridge. The descent into the town was tough and rocky, but we made it! We got our resupply box (thanks Hannah and Tom!!) and are getting ready to set off towards Hampton, TN in the morning!","Overmountain Shelter

Liz Scott,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597212,"Today was too hot. The whole morning was spent with us hiking a steep incline through an exposed meadow, directly under the sun. We both were exhausted and soaked in sweat after only a few miles. We did pass two waterfalls today. The first waterfalls I think we have seen! We got to the shelter in the afternoon and decided we would sit there for a while, take a long break, then keep going a couple more miles. It was supposed to rain, so we figured we would wait out the rain at the shelter. After about an hour of sitting there, it thunderstormed for a little while. After it cleared up, we ate dinner and ended up hiking almost 3 more miles. We found a nice camping spot near a Brook. We were determined to make it to the campsite before the sun when down, so we were booking it once we left the shelter. We did end up making it, although the sun was setting fast.","Mountain Harbour B&B/Hostel

We got to the shelter around lunch time and took a long break to avoid the hottest part of the day. Then, somehow, Scott talked me into hiking 6 more miles to a campsite (we had already done about 8). The most exciting thing we saw today was an old cabin that was falling apart.

We started out going past a beautiful waterfall and along the Laurel Fork river. But then, we had to go over Pond Mountain, or as we like to call it, Pointless Mountain. There really was not point to it. We ended at the same elevation we started at. There was no interesting land feature, and no nice views. All it was was a steep trail up the mountain which was obnoxiously tall and the trail was obnoxiously long. And of course it was sooo hot out. And then, it started raining! At least the rain helped it cool down a bit, for like an hour until it stopped and it was blazing hot again. But oh well. At least we can say we hiked it and we will never hike it again!

It was cool to hike across the dam and around the lake for a while. The rest of the day was spent mostly going uphill to get back to the ridgeline of the mountains and back up to the elevation for the rest of the section. It looks like it might rain tonight or tomorrow, which will be good because a lot of the water sources have been looking a little dry. There are supposed to be a lot of bears in this area, but we have not seen any yet. Hopefully we have hung our food good enough to keep them from getting it if any come around! We had a shorter day, in terms of mileage today, but it was still very exhausting.

Today was just lots of hiking ups and downs. The elevation profile showed several small ups and downs, but those added up to over 2,000ft of both elevation gain and of loss! The trail was also super overgrown in places, are our legs are burning with scratched from thorns and nettles. I wouldn't be surprised if I brushed against some poison ivy too. Oh well.

Scott's sleeping pad also has a hole somewhere and is leaking air very badly.... otherwise, today was just a boring day. It had more ups and downs, but it at least was a shorter day. We are bound to the shelters now since the tent broke, so we could only go about 8 miles. It rained a lot last night and it has been foggy and cloudy all day.

The hike into town was pretty easy. A few small ups at the beginning, but once we got to the TN/VA state line, the trail started to just go down so we could get to the town. Where the trail comes out of the woods and starts following the road through Damascus was so funny. It was just the smallest little dirt path going behind someone's house up into the woods. There was a small, very overgrown sign to tell you it was the AT, but otherwise it was very nondescript. The trail goes all the way through the town, and we hiked on it for a while as we checked out the stores and restaurants in town. Damascus is a nice little town that seems to be up and coming. They have a couple good restaurants and some good outdoor gear stores. The Woodchuck Hostel was amazing! We would definitely stay there again when we come back eventually.
