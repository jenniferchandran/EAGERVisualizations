Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577074,"In March 2017, I started at the approach trail on the 20th.  I was at Fontanna Village on April 3rd ready to head into the Smokies, when I learned that my 94 year old mom was in the hospital and needed emergency surgery.  Hike over.   I went home and tended to business this summer but the yearn is still there.  I've tried to stay busy; hiked the last 80 miles of The Long Trail, spent 3 days in the Whites doing the Carters and Wildcats, built a conservation trail near my house, watched a bunch of You Tube of Early Riser 71 and stayed up with a few ""classmates"" on Trailjournals.  Even ran into a couple of fellow hikers from Georgia on Wildcat (!).  Trying to maintain my fitness with gym work and staying active getting chores done around the house. Tweaking my gear here and there and avoiding a countdown mentality but still focused on trying again. See my 2017 journal for detail on March.",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Wed",0

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580369,"My wife and I were scheduled to visit the west coast the 3rd week of October for a weekend with her brother and then a visit to Sonoma county, Healdsburg to be specific, to take in wine country.  Due to the catastrophic fires, we cancelled our visit.  We didn’t want to risk the fires, the air quality was poor and we frankly didn’t want to go have a good time with all that tragedy around us.  We’ll go some other time.  Instead, we spent time at home working on cutting and splitting wood from some recent tree work and enjoying absolutely spectacular weather.
 We’ve been interested in the Hanover, NH area for a while and decided we’d take a couple of days and go there, since we didn’t get to California.  We drove up Tuesday mid-day and checked in to the Norwich Inn, which is right on Main St.  We crossed the bridge from Hanover that everyone takes pictures of, showing the VT/NH border.  After we got our room and settled in, we went next door to Dan and Whits general store (“If we don’t have it, you don’t need it”) and they had more stuff than I could imagine.  I expect it is a great resupply place for literally anything a hiker could need or want.   After that we took a stroll down Main Street before we went out for Indian food in Hanover (not bad!)
On Wednesday, we got rolling and drove around the countryside up to Lyme, over to Canaan and back to Hanover.  We spied 3 or 4 AT road crossings, which was exciting.   We parked on the green across from Dartmouth and walked down Main Street and found Lou’s diner for lunch (they give a free pastry to thru hikers).   After lunch, we strolled a little more and found the trail on the street again.   We went over to the COOP grocery store and looked at what they had, and then back to the Inn for a break.  About 3 PM, before the rain was scheduled to start, we walked down Main St to Elm St and walked about ¾ of a mile southbound and then northbound on Elm St, so my wife has now started section hiking the AT!   We had a beer on the front porch and then some food at the bar before going up to watch Survivor and baseball.
On Thursday, on our way out of town, we drove to the top of Elm Street again to where the trail comes out of the woods (more excitement!).  Elm Street has been described as “Trail Magic Alley” as a number of people apparently leave coolers out for hikers (Thank you in advance!).  I saw one even in October.  
I'm hopeful that I will make it back to Norwich/Hanover next summer by foot. It is certainly a nice place to visit.",,View Entry,"Nov 09, Thu",0
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582284,"I have the pre-hike jitters/anticipation with less than 40 days before I fly to Atlanta to try this adventure again.  I have my gear ready to go for the most part.  I’m in the process of getting my clothes protected by Insect Shield, which I did last year too.   I plan to ship my gear 7-10 days ahead of departure date, and then will be tracking that via UPS daily until it arrives, after which I will call the hotel to make sure they take care of it.  My pack weight looks like it’s a little heavier than I’d prefer, but includes a few items that I may jettison, or ship ahead.  I’ll decide as I’m leaving if I’ll carry my microspikes before the Smokies, or add them to my box for Fontana.  
 When Thru hikers register their hike with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, they are assigned a registration number; I’m #119.  The ATC issues a plastic hang tag for your backpack, and this year unlike previous years, they are not mailing them, but rather are only issuing them at Amilcalola Falls State Park, Harpers Ferry and Monson (I think).   I decided to go get mine at Amicalola the day before I actually hike, which will allow me to revisit the visitors center and the arch where I left last March 20th, and get a hiker number (last year I was 993).   I rented a car at the airport and will drop it off near my hotel, so that little jaunt will keep me busy once my flight gets in.  I plan to drop by REI in Atlanta for a few minutes to buy fuel too, and it all will work logistically I think.
 I’m continuing to stay active, at the gym, on the treadmill and in the woods, hoping the eventual miles on The Trail won’t be too painful. I’ll post again when the day arrives.

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583251,"I’m one week away.  I mailed my gear to Atlanta and a resupply box to Neel Gap at mile 31.  I made up 2 more boxes, one for The NOC at mile 136 and one for Fontana Village to get me through a few days of The Smokies.  I’ll plan to resupply in towns at Hiawassee and Franklin and if I need more than I shipped, I can augment that at Neel gap and Fontana.  I don’t want to have too much extra food, so tried to budget correctly, but it will be a work in progress for the entire hike.   After The Smokies, I don’t have a box plan yet.
I thought I’d address a few standard questions that come up whenever I tell someone that I’m attempting a thru-hike.
Are you going alone?  Yes, I am. 
Won’t that be scary? Not really, there are lots of people out there and I’ll meet people.
Are taking a gun? No, I don’t own a gun, and it would be a major turn-off to others if you were packing a side arm.  It’s a social experience with like-minded people. Plus you’d need permits in 14 different states and they’re heavy.
What about Bears?  Yes, there are bears; I’m not worried and will follow guidelines to use bear boxes, bear lines and will hang my food from a tree if I am camping in a place without bear boxes etc.  There is a fair amount of disdain in the hiking community about the need to hang food, but I figure why chance it?
Where do get/what do you do for water?  I filter water from a stream or spring.  I also have a backup system that uses chemical purification called Aquamira.
Where do you sleep?  I carry my tent, or sleep in a shelter if it’s not too full.  I carry earplugs to block the sound of snoring.  I’d rather not use the shelters if I can help it because there are typically mice that live around them.  If  there’s a big storm forecast and I’m near a shelter I will likely sleep in it.  In The Smokies, regulations require you to sleep in the shelter unless it’s full and there isn’t time to get to the next one, and then you can set a tent up near the shelter.
How long will it take to complete the whole hike?  The average hike is just under 6 months.  I don’t want to rush it and need to be careful not to hurt myself.  I don’t know how long it will take me.  I just need to finish before Baxter peak closes on October 15th. 
I'll post again once I get going.  If you have any other questions I didn't answer, feel free to ask in the guestbook entries; Also a reminder that last year's journal is to the left under My other Journals.  One of my first posts last year has a bunch of terms/definitions that may be useful to understand The Trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Fri",0
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583503,"Winter storm Riley, a classic New England Nor’easter with wind gusts forecast to be 60 plus mph  made it likely that my mid-morning flight out of Boston on Friday would be canceled.  Jet Blue waived change fees, so I rescheduled for a late-afternoon flight today (Thursday), booked a hotel room near the Atlanta airport and made my rental car pickup earlier for Friday’s visit to Amicalola.  The best plan is a flexible plan! 
Thanks to my wife, the angel, who is supporting my adventure and drove me to the airport on our wedding anniversary, a day earlier than we were planning.  I couldn’t do this if she didn’t encourage me to pursue my dream....thanks honey!  
I’m ready to get on The Trail; the weather for the next few days, through Monday looks great: mid-fifties and sunny with nights in the low thirties.  No rain forecast until Monday night.  Tuesday looks like a day of hiking in the rain, but you can never tell.  
When I decided what date to start this year, I wanted to wait until after our anniversary and also wanted to be near a full moon.  There’s a full moon tonight.  It will be nice Saturday and Sunday night to have a clear sky and a nearly full moon.  Riley blew me up on the anniversary.",,Atlanta,"Mar 01, Thu",0
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583537,"I went back to the airport this morning and the to the Hertz rental counter to get my car.  I drove to Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia. 347 days ago, I was there starting my 2017 thru-hike.   
This year, I’m not climbing the 675 stairs along the falls or hiking the 8-ish miles of The Approach Trail to the start of The A.T. at Springer Mountain.  I registered at the visitors center and am hiker number 518 this year.  I got my AT Hang tag and chatted with the folks in the registration room about Trail preparations and hostels.  Last year I was number 993.  
I poked around, got some pictures of the Arch and got my AT passport stamped.   I drove up to the lodge to see who was around and setting up for the AT Kickoff which will be held this weekend.  I visited with a couple people who had their booths up, and then headed back to Atlanta to hit REI for fuel, check in to my hotel and get my gear sorted and packed, got some dinner and set my alarm for 5:00AM to get up and ready as “Survivor Dave” is picking me up to shuttle me up to Big Stamp Gap at 6:00.  More on this in the next entry.  
Big Stamp Gap is where the parking lot is closest to Springer Mountain.  You have to drive up a rough forest service road to get there.  The parking lot is about a mile north of Springer, so to get to the start you hike South to the summit and then turn around and hike back to the parking lot and continue north towards Maine.
Today was sunny, no clouds but windy and chilly.  I understand that Massachusetts is under water.  
Tomorrow I will start again, start following the white blazes and become Detail. 
Until then, thanks for reading and take care,

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583606,"My shuttle got to the hotel right at 6:00 AM, we stopped and picked up another hiker and headed to Springer.  Dave, the driver suggested that we stash water at Cooper gap, at mile 12.3.  I left a 50 oz water bottle there and we continued to Big Stamp gap.   We got there at about 8:30.  I hiked up to Springer, signed the log book and took some pictures.  I started north at 9:15.   I hiked alone most of the day except for about an hour when I hike with two gents from Georgia.  I got to Hawk mountain campsites at 1:00; too early for me to stop. I set my sites on Justus creek and the camp sites just above the creek known as Devil’s kitchen.  I stopped back to fetch my water on the way.  
Dave and Lyndsey were already set up and let me use their bear line.  Philip arrived a little later.   I got my tent up, cooked hung my bag and was in bed by 7:30.  
It was an incredible day, mid 50’s not a cloud in the sky, the trail was in great shape thanks to the amazing work by the volunteers that maintain the trails.  There are a lot of downed trees and some of them are massive.  If only I could get a few out, there would be a lifetime of firewood!   
My lungs were congested today, maybe from the hotel I stayed in on Thursday night-I think they must get Febreeze for free.   
It is supposed to be at or below freezing tonight so I hunkered in with my winter duds on.  Tired but happy with a big mile first day.","Atlanta

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583776,"I was cold last night.  I had my down jacket and fleece on but still felt cold; woke up shivering a couple of times, made a quilt adjustment and went back to sleep.  Eventually, it was morning and I got myself out the tent and got myself some coffee and packed up.   I left camp at 8:30.  My legs were sore from the muscle cramps I had overnight.  I decided I would try to make it to Lance Creek at mile 23.8
Another fantastic weather day.  I was treated to Trail Magic by McGyver at Gooch gap. He hiked the AT in 2015.  I spent about 30 minutes with him-nothing like a hot dog at 10AM for 2nd breakfast!  Thanks McGyver much appreciated!   
As I left Gooch gap I started hiking with a section hiker and we came across a man and woman (married 42 years) painting blazes.  We thanked them profusely for their service to The Trail.  He was also one of the crew that cleared a lot of the blow downs from Irma in January.  
I ran into another couple and we exchanged hellos and I mentioned that he looked really familiar.  Turns out he worked at The Hiker Hostel, and when I stayed there last year he and the owner Josh got one of my  “Got Wood” T shirts.  What a hoot running into him.
I got to Woody gap at about 1:30 and there was another group of folks with their grill set up and doing trail magic there! I only had one hot dog for breakfast, so got another one at lunch! I also refilled my water bottle from those nice North Georgia folks.  Thank you so much.
I hiked out of Woody gap to Lance Creek camping area and found a spot to set up.  Did all the camp chores (get water, cook, set up sleep pad, cook, clean up, hang bear bag) and then sat by a campfire with a few folks from about 3 generations.  I turned in at about 8:30.","Devil’s Kitchen

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583777,"It didn’t get as cold last night by about 5 degrees so I slept warmer and consequently better.  I got up to a beautiful sunrise of pink and reds.  I broke camp pretty slowly, sat and had a cup of tea and started walking at 8:07.  
Today, the goal was Blood Mountain Cabins at Neel(s) Gap, mile 31. 1.  As the name implies, the cabins are on the north side of Blood Mountain.  Climbing Blood Mountain seemed harder this year than last year and the decent was easier than I remember; last year I started at Woody Gap but had spent the night before at The Hiker Hostel, so maybe I was just better rested. 
In any case, I got to Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap at about 12:45, got my drop box and a Gatorade (blue, like Will Farrell) and headed to the cabins. 
Atlas who is also a Trailjournals blogger and I are sharing the cabin. We got laundry done, showered and ate pizza.   Our loose plan is to hike to Hiawassee by Thursday.   
Tomorrow looks like rain in the morning and then cooler temps for the next few days, maybe even snow.  
Lest I forget, thanks to my trainer Andy for the work over the last 3 years and especially the last 6 months, Bulgarian split squats and sumo squats are the way to go!  I was much less sore today and hope after today’s short day, tomorrow will be even better.","Lance Creek

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583792,"I’ve been out of cell range at camp the last few nights so I’m posting multiple updates; you can use the previous/forward button to read those entries if you want.  
Atlas and I decided we’d hike together today. I left the cabin and headed up to mountain Crossings msg to ship a box home.  I lightened my pack by about 2 pounds getting rid of a few redundant items.  I also wanted to look at a pair of insulated pants to help with the overnight cold  issues I’ve had.  I bought a pair of Montbell thermal pants that got warm immediately when trying them on.  With that done as I was leaving the store  Atlas said that his wife surprised him and he was going to slack pack to Hog Pen Gap.  I appreciated the offer, but just couldn’t bring myself to slack pack on day 4.
I went ahead in the rain and Atlas caught up with me and passed me in about 2 hours.  He is a faster hiker than me (more training and in better shape).  
When we got to Hog Pen Gap, Mrs Atlas was there with hot soup, bread sticks, bananas and water doing trail magic.  Such a welcome surprise, thanks again!  I even got to sit in the car for a few minutes out of the rain. 
When I got out of the car I knew I had to get moving as I was suddenly cold from being damp.  Lucky for me, the trail went up hill!
Eventually the rain stopped, the sun came out and it was a glorious afternoon.  
Atlas waited for me at Low Gap shelter and we decided we’d try to find a camp spot I stayed at last year.  We got there but it was basically all blow downs.  We needed water and so decided to keep going.  Eventually we found a nice spot with a nice fire ring and room for our tents.  We had a nice fire, ate our dinners and looked st the glass ceiling before turning in. The stars were amazing.","Neel Gap

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583795,"I slept pretty good overnight. 
We broke camp in a cold wind that blew in overnight.   We got going at 8:50.  
It was a long cold day.  Depending on which side of any mountain I was on, the wind would bite, so I hiked in my fleece, windbreaker, knit cap, and gloves and used my hood as  a heat regulator.  I leapfrogged with a few college aged hikers most of the day after Unicoi Gap.   
At Unicoi, my plan was to go to either the Cheese Factory Site or Tray mountain shelter.  At The Cheese Factory site, I got a second wind, and decided I’d try for the shelter.  It was still really windy and I figured I may as well be hiking rather than camp and stand around freezing, so I kept going.  In hindsight it feels like it was quite a bit of uphill-most likely-but I haven’t gone back to look. 
I was going to go check out the Tray mountain shelter camping to see how the wind would be, it is at a pretty high elevation...but I missed the turn and refused to go back uphill to get back to it.  
Now low on water, hiking to find the next water and a place to camp with daylight fading, I went as fast as I could safely.  
Eventually I got to the water source and found a Texas gentleman named Mart setting up camp and asked him if minded company.  He said he’d like that.  I went for water way down a steep trail and then got back up to set up my tent etc by headlamp.  
Mart offered to share his Mountain house meal with me, and we made coffee and had pasta primavera and chatted before crawling into the cocoon with the wind absolutely screaming.","Stealth site

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583937,"The wind blew hard all night.  It was loud and must have been sustained 35mph with gusts of 50+.   I stayed mostly warm in my tent bundled in my new insulated pant, my fleece, puffy and gloves.  I was worried a little about getting crushed by dead fall, but obviously made it.  
I got up and packed, made coffee and stuck some snacks in my pack belt pocket.  Mart stayed back to cook breakfast and I took off.   I was trying to get to Dick’s Creek Gap and Hiawassee as early as possible to resupply and do laundry, shower and eat town food.  
I called a shuttle at 12:30 and arranged for a 1:30 pickup and was in my room at The Holiday Inn Express by 2:30 PM.  I did my laundry and shot out the back path to Ingles to buy a couple of days of resupply.  
I met Atlas and we went to Daniel’s Steakhouse next door for a burger before hearing back to our hotel.  We arranged a pick up for 8:30AM and turns out we were traveling back to Dick’s Creek Gap with Mart who got in late in the afternoon.","Steel Trap Gap

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583944,"We got dropped off at Dick’s Creek Gap at 8:50 and started the uphill climb.  We set our sights on Standing Indian Shelter.  We were focused on making miles as there was a big rain storm that looked like it would be soaking on Saturday and we’d be able to get to Franklin on Sunday to dry out if we did a couple of big days. 
Today I crossed the GA/NC border, a big psychological win.  As I remembered, getting there was a long serious of climbs.  I also remember the climbs after the border and was not wrong.  Immediately after Bly Gap is Courthouse Bald which is a punishingly steep climb that lulls you into thinking it’s over and then smacks you around with another big climb.
At about 4:30, I decided I would keep going and go for Standing Indian Shelter, as it was dry and cold, so again, better to be moving than sitting still.  
I had to battle hard to get there but made it at dusk, got water and set up, cooked and got changed in the dark by headlamp.  The shelter was full, so used my tent. I found someone else’s bear line and got my food bag onto it.  I was spent.  I didn’t get to sleep until 9:00-long day.","Dick’s Creek Gap

I saw the moon through my tent overnight.  The wind blew hard again and it was cold, but I stayed pretty warm.    I was awake a lot and at 6:00, I got packing up my stuff.  I fetched my food bag and made some oatmeal and coffee and got hiking at 8:10.  
Today the terrain was more forgiving as it had less uphill except right out of the gate, I continued up Standing Indian Mountain, but it was relatively tame. Albert Mountain was challenging and reminded me of parts of The Long Trail in Vermont.  I remembered it as challenging and it certainly was.  The Trail did not give up any view at the summit as it was clouded in. 
Atlas and I walked the remaining couple miles to Long Branch Shelter and got there at about 4:15.  
This shelter was built in 2012 and has capacity for 16, but there were only 2 other hikers there, so it was spacious and comfortable.   
We made dinner, chatted and settled into our beds by 8:00.  We all felt good about the last 2 days distance and were thankful that the predicted storm didn’t pour on us.","Standing Indian Shelter

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584008,"I didn’t hear the rain last night because I had my earplugs in.  I slept soundly and only woke up a few times, which is par for shelter life.  
The guys on the 2nd floor mentioned that the mice were active up there, but I didn’t see or hear them near me. 
No one started moving around until it started getting light, which was obviously later because of the time change.  
I got going about 9:15.  I only had to hike about 7 miles to Winding Stair Gap to get to Franklin.  I had one tough incline after Rock Gap, and the weather was just fine, no more rain, still cloudy, with a slight breeze, so I took my rain jacket off before the incline thankfully.  After that it was literally all down hill from there.  
At Winding Stair Gap, Atlas and I caught up with Culligan who had been there for 30 minutes trying to hitch a ride.  I hadn’t even taken my pack off when a car stopped and a woman jumped out to greet the 3 of us and asked where wanted to go.  She went out of her way to drop us off at the Microtel.  Thank you!
We were able to check in immediately and they offered to do our laundry-score!  45 minutes later, we were all showered, our laundry was in process and we were on our way to The Lazy Hiker Brewery via a shuttle driver named Jim.   When we were done with a burger and a beer, we were about to call Jim back and in he walked to see if we were ready to go!

I took a shower and walked over to Three Eagles Outfitters and then to a local restaurant for lunch. 
After lunch, I went back to the hotel organized and packed my gear and kept my legs up.  I arranged for a shuttle for 8:00 for Tuesday morning and called The Aquone Hiker Hostel and reserved a spot for Tuesday night as the weather forecast was for sub zero wind chill temperatures .
On reflection from last week when I camped at Steeltrap Gap, when the conditions are so cold that it’s painful to do normal tasks like make or break camp, cook or make coffee, it becomes work and it’s not fun.  Survival becomes paramount in these conditions, and I don’t have the right gear or experience to deal with these low temperatures.  I could make it I’m sure, but I don’t have to, so I’m going to be warm and dry and comfortable when I can be.","Franklin

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584180,"The shuttle driver picked me up at 8:00 as planned.  I was hiking by 8:20. Uphill for most of the morning.  It was cold and and the ground was frozen. I zipped and unzipped my jacket and put my hood up and down as I went from the warm to the cold side of the hills.  I got to the base of Siler Bald at 10:30.   I decided not to take the trail up to see the view as it would have taken about and hour and a half to climb up and down, and I knew there would be views at Wayah Bald later.  
I made Wayah Gap in about 45 minutes and then slogged my way up to Wayah Bald  for about 2 1/2 hours.  It had started to warm up a bit in some places and the track was starting to get muddy and slippery.  I had a few stick saves - my hiking poles kept me from falling on my butt- wouldn’t have been pretty.  There were lots of places still snow covered up on Wayah and the views were incredible. I could see Albert and Standing Indian Mountains that I had hiked last week.  There is some real progress on reconstructing the roof of the stone tower that burned in the fires of 2016.  
As instructed, I called the hostel as I was leaving Wayah on my way to Burning Town Gap and estimated that I’d make the remaining 4.4 miles in just over 2 hours, which I did.   
I was picked up by Steve, given clothes to wear in their place (they control what you bring into their cabin) after I showered.  Maggie, the hostess, made dinner for me and her one other guest and I relaxed warm and comfy, ready to get to The Nantahala Outdoor Center (aka The NOC) tomorrow.","Winding Stair Gap

At 7:00, Maggie came in and made coffee and then breakfast for the 5 hikers staying at the hostel.  Right after breakfast I got dressed in my own clothes and got my pack ready and into the car for the drive back to Burning Town Gap.  
I was hiking by 8:45.  Gap means up.  I set my goal on Wesser Bald by 1:00.  It was about 15 degrees out and windy, so I was cold until I got moving for about 20 minutes.  Eventually it started warming up in places again, so the track got slippery and muddy there.   I made Wesser by 12:30, grabbed some food from my pack and climbed up the observation tower.  It was clear and I could see the Smokies range and Fontana Lake in the distance . Clingman’s Dome was snow covered.  Something to look forward to!  
After Wesser, I set my sights on the NOC and got there at 4:00.  I picked up my drop box, checked in to my room and then walked up to the lodge to do a quick load of laundry, shower, and then back down to the restaurant to get dinner with some other hikers.   I think I made the right call going off to the hostel last night as it was apparently brutally cold and windy and people were miserable. 
I got back to my room and organized my gear, food and pack so I would be ready to go in the morning.   
The weather looks good for the next 2 days and then it’s going to rain, but at least it’s warming some.  I’m thinking of my family and friends in New England getting pounded with snow and wish them well.

I showered and then went up to the lobby to see if I could hire one of the shuttle drivers to get me to the Dam at 7:15 tomorrow so I could see it lit up and get going on a 4-5000 elevation gain day before the normal shuttle time of about 9:30.  Success!  One of the guys agreed to meet me at 7:15, perfect. 
The rest of the day, I messed with my gear and looked at the weather for the next few days (wet and then cooler), talked with my family and took a nap (luxury).  It was a beautiful day and while I wish I was hiking to take advantage of it, I know I can’t run from the weather forever so will deal with whatever comes.

It was great to see the Dam lit up before the sun came up. I crossed the Dam on the road and then entered The Great Smokies National Park.  The road ended at a gate and there was a storm gun and white blazes indicating where The Trail entered the woods.  Shortly after that there was a box for Thru Hiker permits which I put mine in.
I took a side trail up to Shuckstack Fire tower.  It was a challenge for me to go up but I did and the views were amazing.   I had to come down the ladders backwards to avoid feeling like I was going to fall. Very steep steps and about 6 stories high and open structure.  
The weather was forecast to be rainy so I was in full rain gear to start, but stopped to strip that off  as I was too hot.  It was gorgeous out until about 1:00 when it started raining and I got wet, and chilly, so stopped st Mollies Ridge Shelter to don my rain gear.  It stopped raining, but I warmed up.

The shelter motivated at about 6:45.  
I was planning to try to get to Double Spring Shelter today.  Today’s miles were tough.  Reminiscent of parts of Vermont, the track was variable, some steep ups, some scale covered, some dirt, lots of mud and puddles. I fell today for the second time, not bad, but I’m counting it.  It’s said that a Thru hike has 100 falls.  
It was about 45 degrees and partly sunny until 2:30.  Then It started sprinkling, so I stopped immediately and got my rain pants on to make sure I stayed dry.   It started raining harder and then sleeting then back to rain.  I decided I was going to stop at the next shelter, Siler’s Bald Shelter instead of going the additional 2 miles to Double Spring, there was room here and others thought the next shelter may be full.
Today was not the same as yesterday for me.  I struggled with the terrain and mentally rolling dozens of scenarios around in my head on how I could get to Gatlinburg to avoid the major snow storm forecast to hit tonight.  I would have had to hike 24 miles to get to Newfound Gap.  That would have been an impossible mileage for me, and I knew that, but somehow still spent energy trying to figure out how I could do it.  
I got settled in the shelter, made dinner, waited for a lull in the precipitation and hung my bear bag from the cables.  A family of 8 arrived to what ordinarily would have been a full shelter, but all of the hikers scooched closer and made room for them to get a place out of the rain.  The kids range from 18 months to 16.  Amazing. 
Tomorrow will be an interesting day.  Snow is expected to fall heavily and it’s 12 miles to Newfound Gap.  The road is often closed for heavy snow, so, once I get there, I’ll make the decision about if I go to Gatlinburg or keep hiking north.","Spence Field Shelter

People started moving around and waking up around 6:30.  I got my stuff packed, and grabbed a few snacks, but didn’t make coffee or eat.  There was about 5 inches of snow on the ground, it was still snowing hard and the wind was blowing crazy hard.  It was a blizzard.  I learned afterwards that it was a storm named Toby.
I took off around 8:00 and was following footprints of a group of 6 ahead of me until I got to Double Spring Gap Shelter.   They stopped there for water, I kept going.  Now it looked like one or maybe two others were breaking trail.  It was hard to see the blazes, essentially in whiteout conditions.
Today The Trail goes over Clingman’s Dome, the highest point on the entire Trail.  There’s a side trail up to an observation deck that I didn’t even consider taking.  It would have been pointless since I couldn’t see much more than maybe 100 feet. I was cold and miserable and decided I’d go to Mt Collins shelter and spend the night there, hoping that the storm would be over tomorrow and the road reopened.  The alternative would have been another 4 1/2 miles to Newfound Gap, and then hope to sleep in the bathroom (yikes, nooooo!)
I got to the shelter about 1:45, which is on a .4 side trail, dropped my pack and then went down the trail another .1 to fetch water.  I got back and Ridge, another hiker was at the shelter.  I made myself some hot coffee, went to use the privy (cold!) and then made myself some food.   
Dynasty showed up shortly after and the 3 of us compared notes on how cold windy and smart we all were for deciding to stop here.
I changed my clothes into warm pants, fleece top, puffy coat and hung my food from the bear cables. At about 5:30, I got under my quilt to stay warm.  
Spirit Man (also a Trail Jouraler) arrived about 6:00 PM.
I put my rain jacket over my head to help stay warm and keep the mini snow that was drifting in through the top of the shelter wall off my face.  I was mildly uncomfortable but not shivering or in any danger, and drifted off to sleep with the wind blowing and gusting hard outside.","Siler’s Bald Shelter

I changed into my goretex pants and got myself packed and ready.  I set out just after Ridge at about 8:15.
The snow was about a foot deep except where it wasn’t.   Where the wind had blown the snow into the trail ditch and into drifts it was often up to my knees and even my hips going into Indian Gap.  Potholing through snow that deep is hard work even if you’re not breaking the trail. 
Ridge stopped at one point, so I was trail breaking for about a mile or so.  It was interesting trying to find the trail.  Occasionally I saw a white blaze and that made me feel good about the progress and knowing that I was still on the trail.  
After Indian Gap it was mostly downhill, and I got to Newfound Gap at about 11:00 AM.  It was bright and sunny, the road was plowed and plow trucks were passing.  It was still cold and there was some ice on the road and it was still closed.  
Ridge and I decided that we’d start walking to Gatlinburg, which is 15 miles downhill.   I needed to resupply as I had in my food bag 2 protein bars, 1 tuna packet, 1 ramen noodle soup and 1 instant potato package, plus some instant coffee and drink straws.  I couldn’t make it the 40 miles out of the Smokies on that.  
I walked ahead of Ridge after he slowed due to a shin issue, and at 12:30 I passed mike post 11, so I had gone 4 miles.  About 1:15, a National Park Service truck pulled up next to me and Ridge was in the backseat; “would you like a ride? It’s tight but we can make it work.”  Uh, yes sir that would be fabulous! Thank you!!!!  Shortly after that the road opened and cars started going up the road. I’m so happy I didn’t have to walk 15 miles.

The trail was intermittently either ice, mud, packed powder or slush.  Much of the day it was packed powder which was nice as it was a smooth surface without rocks or roots.  Later in the afternoon it was mostly slushy as the temps warmed and the rain soaked everything.  
I don’t know if I was in a cloud, the temp was at dew point or if it was raining, but The Trail gave no views and by the end of the day everything I had on was soaked.  
I skipped trying to go to Charlie’s Bunion as there was no point in scrambling over wet rocks to look at a grey mist that would be no different than what I was walking through. 
A highlight of the walk was “The Sawteeth”, a series of ups and downs that traversed a narrow (8-15 feet) path for what seemed like several miles.  
The forest was thick evergreens and even though there were no long distance views, the contrasts of the green boughs, brown trunks and white snow was strikingly beautiful.  At some points it was so thick and dark it was a little intimidating and downright scary.  I was looking around to make sure Ursus was not stalking me.

This shelter was I think the last of The Smokies shelters to still have chain link fencing and a gate in the front as a measure of bear protection.  As the story goes, the fencing was installed and then people found it entertaining to actually feed bears through the fence for a close up view, so that ended that. Anyway, this one still had the fence up and we didn’t get any visits from bears.

Today was mostly down to Erwin. About 10 miles.  My plan was to get to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel and assess the lodging there, look at the weather and decide whether to zero in Erwin based on those factors.  
I ran into Mongrel, a hiker who is raising money to support dog adoption and we chatted and hiked for about an hour down the final hill to Uncle Johnny’s.  
All that were left were bunk room bunks, not my preference, so I bought a Gatorade and was lucky enough to ride their shuttle to Pizza Plus.   I called the Hiker Shuttle and they gave me a ride to The Super 8, where I got a room
I showered, did some laundry and headed to Food Lion.  I stopped at McDonald’s on the way.  I normally don’t eat McDonalds but I made an exception.  It was as about a 30 minute walk to Food Lion.  I took my time shopping trying to be cautious of the pack weight penalty (failed).  
I walked about 3 blocks to where the road turns to go over a bridge and stuck my thumb out.  The second car that came by stopped and drove me back to the front door of the hotel.  Thanks guys! Their reaction to how far I’ve walked was pretty funny.   
All set with food for the next section, I caught up with my wife, watched some TV and stayed up past my bed time.","Stealth Site at 333

Naturally, this couldn’t last and I started climbing.  I ran into Twofer, another Trailjournaler who was slack packing southbound.  We chatted for a few minutes and then I kept going north.  
There was Trail magic at Indian Grave Gap, by a local church ministry, so I stopped and had a nice cup of coffee and a brownie. Thank you!
Beauty Spot was next and lived up to its name.  I got a clear day with long distance views and I used my Peak Finder App and could see the mountains and ridge line I hiked over the last week or so.  
After Beauty Spot there was a  long steep climb up Unaka Mountain.  Near the top there is a tree decorated with ornaments and mementos. It sticks out in the forest!
At the top of Unaka  I was rewarded with a really pretty spruce forest, the ground was green with moss with a few big boulders scattered amongst the trees. 
I got to Cherry Gap Shelter at about 3:30 and decided I’d stay as I’d hiked 17 miles.  It was a rather tame day in terms of overall effort.  As the day went on, a lot more hikers came in, the shelter filled up and many tents and hammocks were set up nearby.","Erwin, TN

The rain overnight was epic. Heavy winds and the rain pounded most of the night.  Thankfully the shelter was warm with 4 walls and a door. 
I got hiking at 8:10.  The snow that was forecast for the morning didn’t show and it wasn’t bad walking for the first few hours even in the wet and muddy trails.  There was a moment in the fur forest where the sun tried to come out and it as beautiful.
A short hike got me to a road crossing and then I started through the grasslands of the Roan Highlands.  It was basically in a cloud and I couldn’t see very far, but it was gorgeous nevertheless. 
Past the Highlands, the trail started down a series of ancient rock slides and much of that was covered in neon green moss that lit up the damp space.  
I slipped on a root and face planted without injury, as when I was falling I kind of went limp and didn’t fall hard.  I had to lift twice to get myself up as my pack weight was holding me down the first time.  I literally said out loud “that will slow you down” and BANG, I slipped on a rock and fell again.  Jeesh.
I came around a corner and there was this massive rock wall about 100 feet high and 300 feet long.  Very impressive earth!
It started snowing at one point and I kept going, deciding that if I could get a place indoors it would be a good idea.  I called the Roan Mountain B & B and they said they could take me and to call from the trailhead.  
As I approached the road to the trailhead, I smelled wood smoke and looked up and around and bamo, I fell again.  This time I tore my rain pants and skinned my knee.  So that was fall 5 and 3 for the day.
Anne from the B &B came and fetched me at 4:30 and by 5:00, I was showered and in semi clean clothes to go get barbecue, shop for a few days goods and head back to laundry and get rested.  Anne and her husband Steve were fantastic hosts.","Roan High Knob Shelter

We decided we’d stay there and split a cabin, but it was too early in the day, so we decided to slack pack 13 miles northbound to past Watauga Lake and the Dam (closed for bear activity to lingering or staying in the shelter or camping).  I just carried snacks, water and my filter.  
We went past Laurel falls, and a section of the trail that is on a narrow rock ledge around the river.  After that the trail went up Pond Flats (Not!) which is a climb of about 1800 feet in about a mile.  I was in a full aerobic workout, and thankful that I didn’t have my pack at this pace.

Damascus is in sight, the weather was cool, but clear and sunny and the terrain mostly not hard. Just a lot of up and downs.  
Rainbow, Kish, Not Dead and I found a true stealth spot in a forest off an abandoned road and made a camp spot with a fire ring.  We even found a hunter’s folding chair and had the luxury of a seat to share.

Kish and I leapfrogged a bunch and it turned out the camp spot we were looking for was mislabeled in the guidebook and was actually a mile further than we thought.  That just means less distance tomorrow into Damascus!
At the camp site, Hopalong, a section hiking guy from Georgia was already set up.  I found a mostly flat spot and got my tent up and my kit set.  Not Dead and then The Professor came in within a half hour.

We moseyed back to the hostel and stopped at the three outfitters in town to see what we needed.   Back to Woodchucks and I opened the box my wife ( Thank you!) shipped me and to assess my food needs.  I got that figured out, and went through my pack to get rid of some stuff I just don’t need to carry.

I walked back to Mojos on The Creeper Trail just for fun since I already walked The AT through town.   The Trails converged for a while and then The AT goes into the woods and up and over a few hills/knolls/mountains until the two trails meet and The Creeper ends about 6 miles out.  
It was a warm but dry day, and I focused on staying hydrated, which is important.  I got to Lost Mountain Shelter at about 3:15, and took a boots-off rest for a few minutes.  No one else was there and I laid on the shelter floor with my feet up on my pack and took a power nap.  I decided to keep hiking so I would get a jump on the mileage the next day to Grayson Highlands.

It was slightly sloped, but I found a pretty flat spot, got set up, made dinner and a small insect- chasing camp fire and got settled by 8:30.  I’m confident that my trail legs are kicking in finally as my pace is definitely improving and the long uphills are requiring fewer stops to gasp for air!

I had to finish the climb I had started last night up Whitetop mountain, which challenged me.  As I reached the final stair up onto the broad open grassy bald, the view expanded to wide open.  I turned around to see Buzzard Rock and was struck with just how beautiful the view was.  I stood there and marveled at my fortune for a few minutes.  The effort to get there was forgotten by the soul quenching of the view, the breeze and the stellar day.
I hiked onward with Grayson in mind.   I started seeing pony poop a ways before I got to Thomas Knob Shelter, and when I got there, there were 5 “wild” ponies there.  They were licking the rocks in front of the shelter.  I took my pack off and sat at the picnic table and one of them came right over to investigate.  Without hesitation, he licked my leg and if I didn’t shoe him off would have continued.  I guess they like the salt.   After a few minutes another one came over to try his luck.  After a few pictures and patting them I moved on.  I saw a few more in groups over the next couple of miles and a foal in a group that was headed in the opposite direction,  unfortunately I didn’t get a picture.
I hit the 500 mile mark and then “Fat Man’s Squeeze” a narrow passage through large rocks.   Much of the trail today was on Mt Rogers (named for the founder of MIT) and was rocky.  It was slower going as a result, but I was floating from the hike today.  Such a beautiful day, seeing these wild ponies, hitting 500...trifecta!!

At the next shelter there were some guys making coffee, so I got in the shelter and had a cup.  Thank you guys!  I put my rain pants on before I took off as the rain really started to flow.
It was a relatively tame day elevation wise, but it rained like the dickens; Sideways, cats and dogs, wind blown, deluge, buckets, like a garden hose, absolutely epic.  Probably 2 inches in 4 hours. Then there was the wind, and in the early afternoon, lightning and thunder. Fabulous.

The shelter is the old fire warden’s cabin made of stone with 8 bunk spaces.  I got the last bunk, thankfully.  Poor Vagabond Jack got there after me and had to set up on the floor.

I forgot to mention in my entry for Tuesday, 4/17 that I had fall number 6.   It was as I was crossing a field, and The Trail was a strip of dirt surrounded by grass.  The strip was like warm peanut butter in consistency and color.  Well, I slid with my right foot, tried to correct, and my left foot slid too, so I dug my hiking poles in and spun around onto the grass.   Good thing because my boots were covered in that dirt and if I’d gone down it would have been a mess.   I used snow to wipe off the dirt the best I could.  No physical impacts to me, thankfully.","Stealth Site at 552

I called the local shuttle driver, Bubba (honest), he was busy so I figured I’d hitch if I could.   I got to the road at 3:15.  It was a narrow gravel road and there was no traffic for about 5 minutes.   2 cars passed me and then a pickup truck stopped and the driver told me he was only going to the next paved road.

The Trail goes up and over a knoll, then around another hill, takes you over the Senator Shumate Bridge crossing the New River, then under the road next to what I’m told is a cigarette filter manufacturing plant that smelled like acetone.  Finally, the path goes up and into the woods again, but soon it skirts the local landfill.   
At the 9 mile mark there was a grassy field and a shelter just off The Trail.  I stopped in and sat down and had a break.   As the path is a high ridge and there was no water for miles, I needed to decide how far I was going to go.  I decided to head for the 2nd water source about 11 miles further.  
I got moving again and walked under a huge power line and then into and down out of the woods at a road.  There was a park service police car at the crossing.   As I approached the truck, the officer got out, there he was all crisp in his green uniform, flak jacket, body cam, sidearm, etc and I’m thinking uh oh, what the heck?  So the road was closed, I could still walk the trail, but could not camp within 125 feet of the center of the road.  No problem, was planning on moving through further.  Turns out there were some protesters to the Mountain Pipeline tree-sitting and the law is effectively cutting them off.  A few miles up the trail I saw the encampment which was a couple of tents, a ports potty and a mud road that used to be the AT, that was destroyed by the four wheelers, they must have used to get their stuff up there.  I walked to the side of the mud so I didn’t slip and fall in that muck.  
After about a mile of that, I went back into the safety of the woods again.
After a long uphill climb, The Trail headed down parallel to The Pine Swamp Branch Creek to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter.  This shelter was officially closed because of dead trees from Gypsy moths that were considered a hazard.  The shelter is stone, I was beat from my first over 20 mile day, there were 2 other hikers already planning to sleep in the shelter, so I did too.  
I had major problems trying to hang my bear bag.  First I got my rope stuck, then unstuck and onto anothe Branch whichvwhen I hoisted my bag the branch broke. The I picked another tree and my throwing ball got stuck in the crock of a tree and I couldn’t get it down.  It was dark and misting, I hung the bag on the eve of the shelter away from the mice and hoped for the best.  I was able to get the ball and rope down in the morning with about 15 minutes of whipping the rope up so that there was enough slack for gravity to do its job. 
Just after dinner, The Family of 8 roller into camp and set up away from the shelter, quietly and without a lot of commotion.  I thought they were 2 days ahead of me.  
I was happy it was bed time and got to sleep quite easily.","Pearisburg

There were some difficult stream crossings early on, and a bunch of trees spaced over a few miles that were mid-body height with no easy way to go over or under.  It was limbo day!
Every day The Trail throws a new challenge at you.  Just when you think you’ve figured it out, no you don’t.  Today was the combination of the stream crossings, limbo-logs, mud and rocks.  You look at the elevation profile and think “ I can walk x miles today”.  Wrong!  
Today’s uphill wasn’t too bad, but it sure was rocky.  That’s tough on the feet and you have to concentrate on foot placement to avoid twisting an ankle or worse so it messes with the pace.  
I took a break at 2:00 and pushed hard for the next difficult 6 miles and got to the shelter at 5:30.  There were 4 others in the shelter. Again rain was forecast overnight, so I elected to stay dry and deal with shelter life.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

One of the things I really wanted to see on this hike was The Keffer Oak.  It’s a 300 year old tree with a circumference of over 18 feet.  It was 3 miles to get to it and not a bad early day destination.  Wow is it huge.  Check.
After the tree, it was up the ridge time for a change.   I was cruising along a nice dirt path and all of a sudden I see a 3 foot black snake in the middle of the trail with its head down a hole.  I stopped about 2 feet before I stepped on it because, you know, that’s about your horizon while your hiking or else you trip on a rock or root.  Anyway, I knew it wasn’t venomous, so gave it a little gentle (I swear) poke and it raised its head out of the hole and was pissed.  It’s tail was wiggling like a fake rattler and it reared up to challenge the offender (me)!  I got a picture and left it alone after that.  I know I probably should have just let it be so please no comments! (Thanks).
Eventually The Trail got to what was labeled on Guthooks as Ledges.  This reminded me of parts of The Northern Long Trail, basically walking on the spine of the mountain and up and over huge steeply slanted boulders.  Glad it was dry.
I came to another cool place at mile 684 which was the Eastern Continental Divide. Water flows either to the Atlantic or The Gulf Of Mexico on either side of this point.  
I took a break at a shelter to decide how far I could go.  I thought about carrying water up to the top of Brush mountain and walked the 2 miles to the base where there was the last stream before the climb and it was about 4:30, and I just didn’t have it in me.  There was a nice camping spot, water was close and I figured I’d have 2 meals less weight and way less water to carry, so I made camp and called it a day.","Laurel Creek Shelter

I started up the mountain I avoided yesterday at 8:15.  It was not as bad as I anticipated it was going to be.  As the day progressed, and as I got more tired, of course the terrain became more rocky and there were several false summits up to Dragons Tooth.   It was worth it.  Basically it’s a giant slab of rock tilted up and sitting on the side of the mountain.  Since there were no white blazes up to the top,  and I’m afraid of heights, I chose not to climb it.  Why tempt fate? 
The Trail down from The Tooth is pretty difficult.  There are even a few places where there is rebar for steps and a few spots where I threw my poles down to negotiate the drops.  Eventually The Trail spits you out at a road and you can walk a half mile along the road to The Four Pines Hostel, a farm with a large garage that had been converted to a bunk house.  
It’s a donation based set up. They will let you do laundry, shower and shuttle you to a store or The not to be missed Homeplace Restaurant in Catawba.  I took advantage of all 3.   
The restaurant serves all you can eat family style and 8 thru hikers can consume a lot of food.  That poor waitress carted bowl after bowl of fried chicken, ham, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, biscuits, corn, green and pinto beans and multiple pitchers of sweet tea and lemonade to us while we stuffed ourselves.

It being a Sunday and while cool, a beautiful day, there were a lot of weekend hikers.  I took my time up the about 4 miles and got to the famous overlook at about 1:30. 
The view was spectacular.  I got my photo taken by a nice day hiker.  I could only get myself about 3 feet  from the edge and I couldn’t do the sit with my legs overhanging pose.  No way. The drop was infinite to me and my stomach was churning the closer I got to the edge. 
I could see the ridge line to Tinker Cliffs that I was going to tackle next and that was really amazing to have that view.  
Off I set to Tinker.  I was there at about 5:00.  This was the highlight of the day.  As impressive as McAfee was, this felt private.  I could see McAfee now across the valley and the ridge all the way back I’ve to Catawba where I started in the morning, and Dragons Tooth from yesterday.  I used my Peak Finder App and it showed me Mt Rogers, way off in the distance.  That was 200 trail miles ago!  Sick.
There was a large volume of white smoke coming up from behind McAfee, obviously a fire.  More on this in tomorrow’s entry.
I continued along the cliffs for about 10 minutes, actually getting vertigo it was so close to the edge, and then the path relented and again took me to the safety of the familiar woods.  As I descended into the next valley, the opposite side of the cliffs were massive limestone rectangles perched at the top of the slope.  A few had fallen and were down at the bottom or side of the hill and I can only imagine what the sound and destruction would have been when one of them let go. 
I hiked 45 minutes to the shelter, posted up and chatted with a guy doing a small hike for a bit when a large group of 7 hikers arrived.  Chaos ensued as they call themselves The Northbound Horde.

Most excellent, the hotel was just across the road and up a tiny bit, and they checked me in right away.  I got situated and by chance checked Instagram and there was note about the section I just walked out of being closed because of a wildfire at the McAfee Knob parking area.  I later learned that more than 150 acres were involved, people were being shuttled ahead and it will be closed for about 5 more days.  How about that for timing?  I’m fortunate that I got through this section and feel sorry for those hikers who will miss the beauty or have to decide to come back to walk these miles.  It has to be one of the best sections I’ve seen so far.   But...there’s a dragon with matches that’s loose on the town.

I wore my rain jacket and used the pockets to carry what I needed for the day; my water filter, a Gatorade, snacks, my Spot device and phone.  No backpack for me today. It felt very strange, but I could float.  The terrain in Shenandoah is pretty flat, but all the rain of course meant that the trail was pretty muddy and wet. 
Our plan was to hike 12.5 miles in 5 hours and included a stop at the Elkwallow Wayside for a Blackberry milkshake which is a must have during a thru-hike in The Shenandoah National Park.
We made that objective, and because we were soaked, the stop and cold drink made us all cold, so we moved out again quickly and met Toni as planned at 2:30.
We went back to the Super 8, got showered and changed and rested ahead of getting picked up again for the four of us to go out to dinner. 
Thanks Toni for driving us all over Front Royal and Low Gear for sharing this time with us.","Thornton Gap

Maverick and I met up with a couple other hikers that were staying at the motel and walked to L’Dees Pancake House for breakfast.  
We weren’t getting picked up to hike until 12:00, so we had an easy morning.  I went to the outfitter next to the motel, River and Peak, and talked with the owner, John.  It’s a nice shop and I noticed his dog had a dancing bear collar (Grateful Dead), so we had a nice chat and he gave me a shuttle driver’s number for a ride back to town tonight and agreed to drive us to the trail in the morning. 
Toni dropped us off at 12:40 and was heading to the airport to go home, and we  rolled through a cloud and muddy trail.  The trail was a stream much of the day, so shoes and socks were wet.  We had learned that later in the day we’d hit 2 streams that required a ford, so I wasn’t too worried when I was wet almost immediately after we started. 
We moved at close to 3 mph and there was a mid-shin stream crossing near the end of our hike.  
I called the shuttle driver and she got us back to the motel by 6:30.
We showered and headed to a different laundry than we’d used the other day, did a community load and went to a nearby restaurant for dinner and a beer while we waited for our clothes to be de-mudded.
I had pain in the front of my left ankle after the stream ford and as soon as we got back to the motel, I took ibuprofen and iced for an hour. 
We planned to meet at the outfitter st 8:20 for John to drop us off where we ended today.","Little Hogback Mountain

 It was hot, humid, and wet and muddy.  I was a stinking dirty mess almost immediately.
I turned a corner and saw a black shadow dash off the trail and crash down the slope.  I didn’t get eye contact with this one, but he was a fairly decent sized bear.  I hollered and made noise and continued on up the hill.
Maverick and I hiked faster than Low Gear and we stopped at Manassas Gap Shelter for about 90 minutes for water and to dry out mid day.  There were a couple of high school seniors out for a week hike and they had a project to complete for their graduation, that required them to interview thru-hikers.  Maverick and I gave them an interview.  I hope they get A’s, they were bright and respectful young men. One heading to Middlebury and one to USC in the fall; good luck guys!
Once again today, there was no hope keeping feet clean or dry.  The last week dumped record rainfall so conditions were sloppy.
While we stopped, Low Gear passed us and we caught up with him just before we got to the shelter. 
The blue blazed trail to the shelter was a rock hop over streams for about 100 yards.  
We got set up, gathered water, cooked and rinsed the mud and sweat out of our clothes as best we could.  We were all tired from the strength-sapping heat and turned in before 8:00.","Front Royal

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591626,"We got up and had breakfast and broke camp at 7:00.  We were able to take an old road bed back to The Trail to avoid a lot of the muck and water crossing of the blue blazed trail.  It meant we had to hike up hill and then downhill southbound to get back to where we had turned off last night.  We were northbound by 7:15. 
Trail conditions continued to be muddy.  We made pretty fast pace for the first three hours and stopped for a break at the first shelter we came to.  We found a trail magic toolbox near Ashby Gap with cool Gatorade in it.  It was most welcomed!  
We entered a section of The Trail known as The Roller Coaster; a 13-ish mile series of intense steep ups and downs.  We had to get through 8 of them to get to Bear’s Den Hostel.  Wow.  They were hard climbs followed by descents into wet trail and mud followed by another climb.  
Maverick and I hit the 1000 mile mark at about 3:00, stopped for pictures and continued to the next shelter to get water and eat.  We had 4 more miles to the hostel where a shower, pizza, ice cream and laundry would be ours for $30. We got there at about 5:30 after a really tough last climb.   
Glenn at the hostel was really welcoming and gave us the rundown of the hostel.   We enjoyed our showers and food and got bunks and to sleep by 9:00. 
The hostel is an old stone building that was originally a Washington doctor’s weekend/summer home and was stunning.  Definitely a worthwhile stop!","Whiskey Hollow Creek

We were still in The Roller Coaster so we’re dealing with more ups and downs and now even more mud and water in the trail.  I gave up keeping my feet dry right away.
Once we were done with the Roller Coaster, we had a long ridge walk to Harpers Ferry, WV.  The Trail crossed into West Virginia, but was on the border along the ridge so doesn’t leave Virginia permanently until about 2 miles before Harpers Ferry.
As there’s rarely water on the ridge, I needed to get some and took a side trip down to The Blackburn Trail Center to fill up for the 2nd half of the day.  
With about 6 miles left into town, the thunder started and the skies opened up a torrent of hard rain for about 20 minutes.  We were soaked and the trail turned into one big river.  When there weren’t puddles, or a stream, there were rocks.  It was a very challenging afternoon.  
Ultimately, The Trail came to a long bridge over the Shenandoah river.  I missed the turn to the motel and ended up going up into town and then down the roads and extra mile and a half.  
To add insult to injury, when I called to reserve my room, I called the wrong hotel, so I had no reservation when I finally got to the hotel, which was no big deal, but I had reserved at another hotel which thankfully did not charge me for cancelling.  Phew.
All the regular stuff in priority order got done; explode pack, get wet stuff in front of the heater/fan, shower, laundry, ordered delivery from a local pizza place, celebrate the completion of Virginia, plan for the next day. Get rest.","Bear’s Den Hostel

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591961,"After breakfast at the Quality Inn, Maverick and I walked about 3/4 of a mile (uphill!) to the ATC headquarters.  We were early so got some pictures and waited with about a half dozen others for it to open.  
When Laurie got there and let us in there was a lot of discussion about whether the pedestrian bridge over the Potomac and the Tow Path on the Maryland side was open.  They were closed for about a week due to flooding and a road washout from the heavy rains.   Stories of hikers jumping the fence and walking the closed section were swapped.  About 30 minutes later, the official word came in that the section was reopened, so no drama or shuttle was needed.  
Everyone got their official ATC pictures taken and then Jeff gave us our numbers.  I was NOBO number 316.  That means I am the 316th person to arrive and sign in at headquarters this year.  I walked every mile; no yellow or blue blazing, no skipping any section of The Trail.  The Trail continues to provide daily interesting challenges.  Over half of the journey so far has been in Virginia and I’ve finally crossed into West Virginia, which will be a fleeting visit.
After the ATC, Maverick and I walked to the historic old town of Harpers Ferry, looking at the old buildings and a couple of Civil War battle exhibits, visiting an outfitter and then heading for lunch at a deli.
We tried hitching back up the hill to the post office, without any luck, and walked up to retrieve our boxes.  Thanks to my wife, my box was there and full of resupply needs and my cooler quilt.  
We walked back to the motel, where I went through all my food and decided to forward some of it about 100 miles north and grabbed my winter quilt, gloves, a long sleeve shirt and a few other items to send home.  Back up the hill to the P.O. to send those boxes and then back to the room.  I had to replace another hiking pole top and the maintenance guy helped me with a heat gun.  In case anyone else ever uses a heat gun on carbon poles, be very careful, when it got hot it was really pliable and could have easily been ruined.  I think boiling is a better choice.  
I ate my leftover takeout for dinner and called it early in preparation to head out in the morning.","Harpers Ferry

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591962,"We left the motel at 9:30 and hiked back to Harpers Ferry historic town via the woods.  On the way we stopped at Jefferson Rock, which overlooks the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers and it’s speculative that this was President Jefferson’s inspiration for The Voyage of Discovery he commissioned Meriwether Lewis to undertake 20 years after Jefferson wrote about this spot.  One of my favorite books  is Undaunted Courage, so this was a real treat to see. 
We walked over the footbridge next to a railroad trestle that brought back childhood memories (to my brother) of a morning long ago.
The trail was flat for about 3 miles so we made good time walking between the Potomac and the canal.  It being Maryland, it didn’t surprise me that thee were gazillions of turtles of all sizes in the canal.  Terrapin!
The track was pretty good, some rocks, some mud, but generally the elevation profile was nice.  We saw a lot of civil war battle information about the September 1862 Confederacy’s northern attack. There were places along the trail that looked like they’d been dug out as trenches and probably cannon placements that hav never been filled in. 
We were slow in the afternoon as it was of course hot, but we were focused on getting to the Dahlgren backpackers campground.  Right after The War Correspondents memorial, Not Dead came up behind me.  We caught up while hiking for a couple of miles and then she went ahead; she was trying to catch her tramly (trail family) that is ahead a few days since she took a few days off.
We got to the campground at about 6:00.  There was flat ground, picnic tables, a bath house with running hot water and showers, and potable cool water out back.  Luxury.
There were quite a few people at the campground and we got settled, showered and fed and to sleep just before dark.","Harpers Ferry

The Trail handed us little bit of everything today; a Nice dirt smooth path for a while, mud, standing water, rocks for a couple of one mike stretches, steep climbs, fields of tall grass, a challenging rock hop across a stream ( I made it with dry feet!), busy road crossings and finally a water challenge.  Our shelter had water, but it was .6 mile downhill, so I choose to get water .8 mile ahead and lug it uphill (ugh!).  It was a steep, rock staircase and I was dragging at the end of a long day so definitely a challenge to my legs.  I made it but that last .8 took about 30 minutes.  
There were nice tent sites, and I choose one with a bench near the back, which was a good call as a bunch of people came in near dark including a group of Scouts that had to set up and cook.  Things settled down pretty quickly, but I was happy to be outside the chaos.
I was tired and didn’t have a lot of extra water, and ended up getting leg cramps and needed to drink a bunch to catch my hydration up.  I slept pretty well after that.","Dahlgren Backpackers Campground

We hiked leisurely for an hour, took a break for a drink, hiked another hour and were at the park by 9:30.  We caught a little trail magic someone had left on a picnic table, chatted with Professor and his son, got water and hung out for about 45 minutes enjoying the view.   
We still had 3 miles and a 700 foot climb and it was getting hot, so we moved north at 10:15.  We got to Route 16 in Waynesboro, PA at 11:30 after crossing The Mason Dixon line. Maverick has never been in the north so I teased him about how he needs to watch out and be careful and told him he’d be alright with me with him.  
Our shuttle driver got to the trailhead within 10 minutes and we were off to the motel.  The town was spread out and it was so hot, so I asked if there was a rental car agency around as we needed to go shopping, to do laundry, get dinner etc.  There was none except U Haul.  I called and they had a van!  We had 15 minutes to get there and we made it with time to spare.  We drove out in a big Chevrolet Savana U Haul cargo van with our packs in the back.  
We drove to the motel, got checked in, showered and then walked 2 blocks to Waynesburger for lunch.  We walked back and grabbed our laundry and made lists of resupply needs at Walmart, then drove to do laundry and Walmart and finally for dinner.  We were back for bed by 8:15. It felt pretty hilarious riding around town in this giant van.
Once again, I want to remember how fortunate I am to be able to try this adventure.  I thank my wife for her continued support both through her encouragement and sending me resupply and especially for keeping things going smoothly at home with everything she already has on her plate.  Thank you honey, your support is critical and I appreciate it and love you."," Raven Rock Shelter

I ran into The Crawfords ( the family of 8 I have been leapfrogging since early innThe Smokies).  The youngest promptly told me he was two.  I ended up hiking between two of the girls ( 8 and 12) and they chatted me up for about a half hour until I excused myself and hiked ahead.  I passed the other 3 kids in another 15 minutes and came up to a merger of The AT and another trail and there was a woman with a small cooler on her back.  She asked if I was a thru-hiker, and in the affirmative, promptly offered me an egg-McMuffin and hash browns.  Oh yeah!!  3 miles later, Little Blue’s parents were at the road doing trail magic and I got an ice cold blue Gatorade-perfect. 
On to Caledonia State Park, where the plan was to pay to camp and use the shower.   It was chaos of a holiday weekend and we decided that since the park camp sites were a mile away, we’d hike north 2.4 to the next shelter instead.  First we got burgers and fries from the snack bar.  
We got to the Quarry Gap Shelter at 6:15.  An amazing shelter.  Actually 2 shelters, with two picnic tables, hanging flowers, a clear spring, two tent platforms, lots of little statues, a bench, a swing, and the privy had air fresheners in it!

I made good time early, but then it got really hot, so I slowed down.  I started getting a headache and recognized I wasn’t drinking enough, so made up for that and drank as much as I could.  
The Trail gets near Boiling Springs flowing out of the woods through hay and wheat fields and was downwind from a pig farm that literally choked me from the odor.  Apparently you should breathe through your mouth.  
Maverick and I got to the Boiling Springs backpackers campsite at 3:30.   Low Gear, stopped at a shelter a few miles back and was planning to hike in tomorrow.  We learned that the pool and showers were not open until the following week, so that was a disappointment.
We walked into town and found a place for dinner and stopped at the ATC office for water for the night before heading back to the camp.
There were 4 of us camping.  The camp is about 100 yards from a train track and trains went by about every two hours all night.  I could hear the horns ahead of the rumble by about 2 or 3 minutes; the first one that came by at around 9:30, blew his horn right next to.

As soon as we got into the woods, the mosquitos descended on us in a swarm.  I struggled to get my Deet spray out of my hip belt pocket and swat them and tried to keep moving to hopefully keep more of their kamikaze attacks away.  Once I got the spray out and liberally sprayed my arms and neck I rubbed some on my face and hat.  
The attack relented some, and we got to a muddy wet trail.  There were lots of little creature tracks to see including really tiny deer prints. 
The Trail went around and through a bunch of fields and at one point through hip-high grass that overgrew the path.  Once we started climbing a ridge that eventually went back down to the Susquehanna river, the rocks started to get rough.  They were harsh all the way to the road.  
Maverick had tried to call a local motel to see if we could get a room.  Even though we had just had a night in a motel, we were gross. The dew point was over 70 degrees and I was literally soaked.  I could wring “water” out of the bottoms of my shorts.  Disgusting.  Anyway, the Motel was sold out.  Siri couldn’t find me anything, so I gave up and focused on the rocks. 
I stopped for a rest and Maverick came by to let me know he had contacted one of his YouTube viewers who had offered to help him.  We met Mike Burton at the road and he immediately gave me a Powerade.  He drove us to the Lutheran church, which runs a hiker hostel in Duncannon where we got set up on the air conditioned basement floor.  Mike wanted to take us to dinner, so we arranged a pick up time for later and went to the laundromat.
While we waited for our clothes to get sort of clean ( they’re never really clean anymore-they’ll need to be burned) we went to a The Doyle hotel and had a beer.   The Doyle is an old hotel, in an old town with an iconic Trail reputation, so it was nice to see it.

The rocks cause me to slow way down as foot placement is difficult.  The Trail gets you with a muddy spot, then hits you with rocks that stick in every direction, tilt and move-even though they look stable,  physics takes over and the lever concept will shift a huge rock when you step on it.  If the rocks aren’t boulders that shift, they’re sharp and constant.  
In the afternoon, Maverick texted me from .3 miles ahead that he had spied 2 large rattlesnakes just off the trail.  I went hyper-aware, and despite looking for them, never saw them.  He showed me pictures later.  I was looking 2-3 feet off The Trail, thinking about getting struck, and they were apparently 6-10 feet off the path- but one on each side; surrounded!  I wonder how many more of the Devil’s I’ve walked by without knowing.

As we left, I was sauntering along daydreaming and thought “I wonder how much further it is to the mile mark where I’d be under 1000 miles to go”.  I stopped and pulled out my phone to check the app....I was at the point right then. How crazy is that? 1191. 1000 miles to go.

We left with the goal of making 10 or so more miles and we were going along some rocks when Maverick slipped and fell onto his gluteus Maximus.  It was a loud and painful hit.  He shook it off, took some ibuprofen and we slowed a bit.  It hurt though I could tell.

The rest of the day was uneventful and we made great time, rolling into the Eckville Shelter around  3:00.  The path was fairly flat and not too rocky; we’re told that The Trail coming up is where the rocks get extremely rough, and there’s a section with very little water so the challenges will continue.

As we climbed a hill, Maverick and Goober saw a bear running down from above, I was ahead and didn’t see it.  When we got to the top of the climb, another 2 hikers were standing back and looking at a large rattlesnake that was coiled up right next to The Trail.  One of the 2 discovered it when she sat down on a rock about 3 feet from it after seeing a bear (probably the same one that ran down the hill), and then the snake rattled at her.  She was having quite an exciting morning!
Those 2 hikers had written a note and moved on around the snake.  Maverick, Goober and I took turns moving past the snake and within 5 minutes we spotted 3 more coming out into the sun on the rocks.  These were large snakes.  We were very focused the rest of the day whenever we got near any sunny, rocky spots. 
It was a long day of rocks.  We made a stop at a B and B for a lunch and cold sodas on ice at a road crossing.  We still had over 6 miles to go to our planned stop.  That included a challenging and sketchy climb over Knife’s Edge, a narrow, rocky ledge that would mean the end of a hike with a slip.
After the Knofe’s Edge, we navigated the rocks up and over Bake Oven Knob and got to the the Bake Oven Shelter by 4:00.

We stayed mostly dry.  It rained lightly until we stopped for breakfast and to get enough water for the whole day and night.  There is no reliable water for 20 miles,  so we filled everything we had.  I carried an extra 2 liter bag which meant I was carrying an extra 4 1/2 pounds, plus I had my two regular bottles and my 1/2 liter filter bag filled.  It wasn’t hot today, so I had plenty of water and that de-risked the water situation. 
We walked across the Lehigh River and then we had to climb up Blue Mountain which was an intensely steep rock scramble/climb.  I threw my poles up and had to use my knees multiple times to climb up.  The rain didn’t help matters any and the rocks were slick, so it was really slow going.  Less hiking than rock climbing for longer than I preferred.
The top of Blue Mountain is an EPA Superfund Site from zinc mining, so we didn’t want to spend any more time around there than needed to get through.  Thankfully, there was a smooth, grass path that gave us a reprieve from the constant rocks both before the bridge over the river as well as after the rock climb.  As expected, the reprieve was limited to about 3 miles and then it was back to the sharp pointy rocks for the rest of the day.  
The rain continued and we got to the Delp Soring trail junction where we planned to tent.  We got tents set up and it quit raining long enough for us to eat and get our food bags hung. 
Another early night in the tent!  It’s damp and not very warm so I’m using my sleeping bag liner tonight.

She was sobbing; Maverick and I both gave her a half liter of our water that we carried yesterday.  She appreciated it.
We were headed to Wind Gap for a night in town, laundry, showers etc, so even though the rocks were pretty constant, we still made it the over 10 miles in 4 hours.

The rocks were continuous and sharp for 6.8 miles.  That’s when we got to Wolf Rocks, this is the point where the glaciers in the last ice age stopped.  It was dramatically better once we came off Wolf Rocks. It wasn’t permanent, but it was a reprieve.   
We hiked down a rocky staircase to Delaware Water  Gap and to an outfitter and then for a late lunch/early dinner.  
We left town around 5:00 which is not normal for us as we typically are stopped by then. We walked through town and then over the long bridge right next to Interstate 80, over the Delaware river.  The bridge shook when semi trucks went by and we hustled to get over. In the middle we crossed into New Jersey, happy to have finished another state.  After a bunch more road walking through Delaware Water Gap Park, we returned to the woods and a long uphill climb. It was interesting hiking in the late afternoon.  We had to stop just under 2 miles from the campsite to go down to a spring for water and then carry it up the rest of the way to the site.  
We got to the campground and set up in New Jersey for the first time.  It was a beautiful place, big, grassy (albeit with rocks) and open to the west; so we were primed for a nice sunset.  We watched a while and then headed off to our tents for the night.","Wind Gap, PA

Maverick and Goober caught up with me and we all went to the AMC Mohican Outdoor Center for 2nd breakfast.  It rained on and off until about 11:00, and we were wet and chilly leaving until we got moving uphill and then we were more than warm.  
I slipped on a wet rock; I didn’t go down but I caught myself and lacerated my right leg on a sharp rock. I got a clean inch and a half wide, deep cut like from a knife.  As soon as I saw it I knew I needed to deal with it; it wasn’t just a scrape.  I dropped my pack and got my first aid bag out and by that time blood was already running to the top of my sock.  I figured it was best to let it bleed to clean the wound. I wiped the blood a few times and then used two butterfly bandages to close the cut and covered them with a regular bandaid.  I probably needed stitches or glue but no chance for that.  I got my pack back together and was ready to get back to it.  It was almost 800 miles since I fell last.  I guess I was due. 
I hiked on the rest of the day through intermittent rocks and smooth trail, up and down 200-300 foot inclines to rocky ridges and slab rock walks.  I was taking it really slow and deliberately; being extra cautious as I didn’t want another fall.   
I caught up with Maverick and Goober just before the Brink Road Shelter and we discussed our plan. We were going to camp there but heard that the mosquitoes were horrible; so we went and filled water  at the spring and got attacked relentlessly and then moved out.  We got harassed for the next mile and found a spot that was flat -there were still lots of the little devils but we had to stop.  All of us were beat from the long day.   
I made dinner, hung a bear line and re-dressed my wound with new bandages, Neosporin, and a piece of Tegaderm that my wife had sent me ( thank you!) then got the rest of my bed set up and turned in for the night.
I looked at the weather and saw that there was a possibility of thunderstorms at 11:00 so was in a twilight sleep for a couple of hours before I got up and pulled my clothes inside my tent and closed the flaps.  It rained a little bit and the storm seemed to bypass us to the north and south.  I could hear it and there was some lightning, but the brunt of it missed us.","Backpackers Campsite

I started with 2 dogs, chips and a Powerade ( c’mon, it was the special!), mind you it was, I think,10:45AM.   Then we went across the street where I had a small ice cream and a personal cherry pie with a Diet Coke.  The pie was about 6 inches in diameter and I had 2 nice scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Ummmm.

The Trail started out smooth and gentle and then switched to rocks and ups and downs and climbs.
Terrain reminds me of Mount Desert Island in Maine.  We got to The Lemon Squeezer which is a narrow 20 foot passage between 2 massive rocks.  I took my pack off and struggled through it.  Right after, there is a big straight up, actually reverse angled climb that was about 10 feet up.   I looked at it to find a way up for about 5 minutes, then pushed my pack up, threw my poles up and used a tree to hoist my sorry butt up.    Once I got up there I looked backwards and there was a sign that said “The easy way”.   I didn’t see that going up.   I’d like to think I would have skipped the easy way since I have skipped any part of The Trail or Blue or Yellow blazed.  I helped Flatlander with his pack and pulled him up the cliff after he said he’d like the help.
Water was scarce.  Thanks to all the Trail Angels that left gallon jugs at the road crossings!  I filled up about 4 times through the day.  Much appreciated.   Near the end of the day, when almost to camp I got some brown water from a “brook” that supposed to be a reliable water source...NOT.
I still had about a mile to go, and found Maverick set up near The Fingerboard Shelter.   Goober had decided to walk to a nearby park about a mile away and he brought me back a Powerade, that I drank with my dinner.  I didn’t have to drink the sludge water!

They caught up with me and we all went up Bear Mountain to Perkins Tower.  There were bending machines there, so I got a nice cold Powerade and drank that.  It was 2:30 and we were trying to get to Bear Mountain State Park and the Trailside Zoo.  We made it!  More vending machines!  I got a chocolate ice cream sandwich and ate that while cruising through the zoo.  There were 2 black bears in an enclosure-poor things.  This was the lowest point on The AT at 177 feet.

After I got back to my tent and was cooking dinner a Med-flight helicopter came in and landed in the field in between the camping and the bathhouse.  There was a fire truck and ambulance plus the copter.  A couple of other hikers came in and said there was a rescue going on of a hiker (not a thru-hiker) who had apparently hurt himself.  A couple days later I learned that he had fractured his femur and the med flight was actually not used but was there just in case he needed to go immediately.  It’s pretty scary how quickly things can change; I had just hiked that section a few hours earlier and didn’t see anyone.  The copter sat there for about 3 hours, I’m guessing while the Hiker was transported.  It was pretty rough terrain so Search and Rescue would be working really hard.

The terrain was pretty good, a few small climbs and only one of 900 ft. The downhills weren’t too hard either.  At about 6 miles, there was a little roadside stand selling snacks and drinks.  I got a Powerade and a freeze-pop and sat down for 10 minutes.  This was clutch, as a 900 footer was up next.  
I made the shelter by 12:55 and grabbed the first tent platform I came to.  Maverick and Goober rolled in within 10 minutes and Maverick got the next platform.  The camping area here doesn’t have much capacity but there is a huge bunkhouse.  Fortunately we were here early enough not to have to sleep up there as it will be quite warm I’ll bet.

We rolled out of camp about 7:30 and despite my anticipation of the remaining climb up Mt Greylock, it wasn’t that bad.  
I felt something on my left side as I was hiking that made me think I had a tick, so as soon as I got to Bascom lodge at the top of Greylock, I made a beeline for the bathroom to gave a look.  Nope. Thankfully just an abrasion from who knows what.  
The lodge is pretty special; I’d like to go back and spend a night there.  It’s an old wood and rock structure, well maintained and open and beautiful inside.  
We climbed the lighthouse monument to see the view, which was ok, but it was pretty hazy due to the heat and poor air quality.  The monument is a war memorial and I think quite well done.  
After about an hour up on the summit, we started down and made good time to North Adams.   Somehow, my iPhone locked, probably bouncing around in my pocket, and I couldn’t reach my wife, but Goober had battery and service, so we called and arranged a meeting place a half mile up the road at Stop and Shop.   
I went into the men’s room there and did a baby wipe bath and a full change of clothes, bought a cool drink and within just a few minutes, up my Trail Angel came!

I also got my new pack set up and ready to go; here’s the background- I bought the Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60 liter pack.  I used it on The Long Trail and last year for my abbreviated AT hike and then this year.  It started ripping where the waist belt goes through, so I asked my wife to see if she could find a upholstery repair place that would fix it while I was home.  She ended up contacting Gossamer Gear for advice and they sent me a brand new pack and hip belt set up express mail.  Wow.  What a great company.  I guess an AT Thru Hiker has pull!  Nice job honey.  Unbelievable.

It was so windy and raining that we didn’t want to linger for fear of getting cold or lightning starting.  We started downhill, and The Trail decided it needed to go up and down a bunch over big rocky, rooty, puddle filled sections before it started down steeply next to an absolutely raging river- Beaver Brook.  There were parts that were really scary-a slip into that stream would mean certain  death as it was moving so fast and so steep that you’d be broken into pieces in seconds.  I’m not being dramatic. It was frightening.  
Max was a trooper and made good decisions with foot placement and pace.  Safety was key.  There were rebar had holds in places and a section where the trail had washed out and a rope was strung up on the hill next to that spot so you could hold onto it while jumping over the washed out section. We came to a place where The Trail turned down so steeply that we elected to find an alternative way to the bottom of a steep section.  That meant dropping 40 feet down a slippery muddy gulley, but at least it wasn’t right next to the brook. I’m not ashamed to say I skipped this piece.
We had to ford several streams that were flowing fast and were shin deep.  When we got almost to the parking lot at Kinsman Notch, there was a stream that was flash-flooded with no way across it.  It was too fast to risk walking through, but there was a tree down that presented a bridge so we carefully balanced across about 15 feet and then jumped to the opposite side.

No chance of dry feet at all.  At some point early on, we all gave up trying to keep our boots dry and walked through the water without a care. It wasn’t all that bad once I was wet and accepted that it was going to be that way all day.  It made the stream fords easier too.  
The rock climbing and scrambling was challenging but a fun change even in the rain, which at times was quite hard. Going down hill was pretty tough on the big slabs with wet muddy boots and we took our time to avoid falling.  I was pretty successful not wiping out except one little spot where my pack saved my butt.
It stopped taking briefly and the clouds blew out but we were still climbing South Kinsman so no views.  Later in the day from North Kinsman, we got a 15 second view of what I think was Franconia Ridge.

We got to Interstate 93 at 10:00 and walked the roughly 1 mile to the Flume Visitors Center where we got an Uber to our motel within a couple of minutes.   We couldn’t check in just yet but we used their locker room for showers, then went across the road to an Italian restaurant for sandwiches.  When we were done we got into the rooms and laid our stuff out to dry.  Then we walked up the road to buy a few things for the next day or so and came back for a rest and laundry before dinner at the Italian place.

I tried to get an Uber, but the only driver was not on line, so we decided we’d try to hitch.  Within 5 minutes a local woman did a u turn and took us up the road to the Flume visitors center and dropped us off.  Thank you!  We walked just over a half mile on a bike path back to The Trail.
Immediately we started walking up hill and that went in for a couple of hours.  We passed Mt Liberty and soon broke out to the view of Franconia Ridge.  There were lots of people out and the weather was spectacular.  What a jewel.  We marveled at the scenery and took our time over Mt Lincoln, the Mt Lafayette and finally the challenging Mt Garfield.
We were challenge by lot of steep up hill, climbs up and over giant rocks and muddy spots.  The reward was so worth the effort.
At the top of Mt Garfield, there was a large group of weekend hikers all heading to The Garfield Ridge Camp.  Max hustled ahead and scored a great spot on a tent platform for us with the caretaker.  I went as fast as I could down the last about half a mile and was so happy to get there and have a spot to set up.  The caretaker expected 60 to 70 people at this site tonight.
Once our camp was set up, we went back to the entrance trail and got water and then back to cook dinner.  It started sprinkling as we were eating, so we were in our tents by 6:30.   A couple of late arrivers, including a guy sharing the platform, kept us from sleeping until about 9:30.  There was thunder in the distance on both sides of us, but it never really let loose, so we stayed dry.  Our plan paid off; the weather was kind to us and we traversed the Franconia Ridge without lightning and with amazing views.","Lincoln NH

I would have gone the wrong way back up an incredibly steep AT had it not been for Max who corrected me that the trail that I thought was the shelter access trail was actually The AT.  I was so focused on getting to the shelter yesterday afternoon I failed to realize that when I turned downhill I was still on The Trail. Whoops.  Thanks Max.
We had to descend a very steep section that was actually a stream and waterfall. I had to sit down at one sot to get down a rock and just sat right in the water to make the climb down.  I dried off in an hour.  
We spent the next while dropping elevation and then climbed up to  Galehead Hut where we filled our water bottles before climbing South Twin Mountain.  This was a rather steep and seemingly unending climb of about 1000 feet.  After that we dropped for most of the day. 
We caught up to Maverick at Zealand Hut and then we all walked most of the way to our destination together, although Maverick out paced us and was there when we got there just before 5:00.   Along the way we hit some amazing blueberry bushes with big ripe fruit.  Lucky us.  We all got a few handfuls. Even though The Trail had gone pretty flat and without a lot of rocks, I slipped on a root or caught my toe and boom! I fell and got quite a scrape on my right shin.  I think that’s number 13  ( there have been a few I didn’t report  ;). Lucky for me it wasn’t on a rocky steep section.

While we were waiting to eat, the sunset was putting on a spectacular red show.

We took off and climbed up to the summit of Mount Washington; that took about 75 minutes.   We had clear weather and very little wind.  We looked around at the buildings (chained to the ground for protection from the wind!) and took pictures at the summit sign.  I’ve heard stories where people had to wait in line to get these pictures.  We had the place to ourselves.  We waited until 8:00 and then went into the visitors center and the museum and started hiking again at about 9:00.
The Trail was essentially just a rock pile for most of the day.  We dropped a bit, walked along the edge of The Great Gulf Wilderness which was awesome then climbed around Mt Jefferson and Adams and then up and down some before we got to Madison Spring Hut at about noon.  We stopped and had a piece of blueberry coffee cake and a drink and filled our water bottles.  
We had a very steep half mile rock climb up to the summit of Mt Madison and then the fun really started.  We continued following huge cairns down and then up repeatedly all on the huge punishing rocks that are Mt Madison.  I had heard this descent was difficult and it lived up to my anxiety.  After we got below tree line, it was just as steep and hard to make time.  After 2 1/2 hours we had “hiked” 3 miles.  We still had 4.8 to go and were hosed.   
The Trail followed The Great Gulf Trail and there were lots of PUDs, some stream crossings, mud, stone walls and downed trees to get over.  
After a few stops to cuss, drink water, rest and re-motivate, we finally got to Pinkham Notch and met up with Maverick.  
We asked a group of AMC employees if any one wanted to drive us to Gorham and Hannah offered to do it for $20.  Sold.  Thank you.
We got ourselves checked in to our motel, showered and went next door for dinner.  We decided that the abuse we out ourselves through merited a day off before we tackle The Wildcats.

After The Wildcats, we dropped steeply to Carter Hut for lunch- we got soup and bread and some blueberry coffee cake and filled our water bottles.
Another steep climb up Carter Dome left me wiped out and I caught Maverick and Max for a break at Mt Hight for views back across to The Presidentials in the clouds.

Maverick and I got dropped at The Trail at 9:30 after returning the rental car.  We road walked for a bit and then hit the woods on a nice trail for a couple of miles. It went up of course and then got really muddy and rocky and challenging.  
This section of trail seemed neglected, there were plants crowding in and blow-downs galore, plus a very swampy mud puddle filled trail.  There were many puncheons sinking in water or mud. 
It was slow going, plus very hot and humid and I developed chafing and was uncomfortable. I got to camp at 5:15.  I claimed a tent platform and Maverick was kind enough to get water.   It came from a pond, so I double filtered and tried to limit my intake.  No point in tempting fate again with Giardia.
We crossed 1900 miles today. There was no sign or fanfare.  We can feel the end coming and are beginning to think more in terms of miles left than the bigger number we’ve hiked.

Muddy feet.  I walked around one giant mud bog and another hiker reported that he slipped off a log and went in half way from his knee to his hip in the mud.  There were quite a few steep climbs up and down rocks and on slabs both up and down to challenge us.  A few spots had rebar steps and there was a rebar ladder that went straight up a 20 foot climb.  There were a few wooden ladders built out of logs. 
There was limited water today, I dumped my remaining pond water and refilled at a stream about 2 miles into my day, but there was nothing but bogs the rest of the day.  I got to the shelter completely empty and immediately dumped my pack on a tent platform to claim my spot, and then went down a hill to the water source.  It was a spring that was pushing out cold water but it was brown.  Not a problem to drink, just unappealing to the eye.  
I suffered mightily today with chafing.  The sweat was really stinging and painful.   Since I haven’t had this issue the entire time I’ve been out here, I have to assume that it’s related to the laundry I did the other day.  I’m hoping the Gold Bond lotion I’m using cures me quickly.

We enjoyed our coffee to a bright red ball of a sunrise and then took off.  Mahoosuc Notch is known as the most fun or most difficult mile on The AT.  That’s because the trail takes you over or under giant boulders and through caves and slots through a giant notch with cliffs in both sides. 
There was cool air flowing through the notch like we had entered an air conditioned room. It was very challenging and I was forced to take risks that I wouldn’t normally take- like hanging onto a dead pine tree while rotating around a rock with my back to a huge rock 20 feet below.  Thankfully the tree held me. 
It took us 2 hours to get through the notch.
We stopped and had a break for water and a snack as the next challenge was The Mahoosuc Arm and Old Speck.  The Arm was a long battle up about 1900 feet and then Old Speck was another 600 very steep slabs.  I wouldn’t want to come down those slabs if they were wet.  After a rock climb to the top, there was a long downhill to a parking area that is near Bethel, Maine.  Maverick was there and had a beer for me from a driver that was picking up another hiker.  What a welcome beer.  We got a Gatorade, pringles and granola bars from a dad supporting his daughter’s thru-hike; much appreciated!

There was a nice breeze up there.  We hiked over the bald and then to a long sketchy slope down the other side of the mountain.  We stopped at a shelter to get water and had a discussion about our hike and decided to Nero into Andover and slack pack tomorrow; that would get us to the same place at the same time as our original plan, just with dry clothes and a shower a day earlier.

We walked .3 miles to a major highway and met a hiker’s (Pocahontas) mother that offered to drive us the 3 miles to The Sterling Inn.  We got checked in by 10:30!  At 11:30, all showered, we got a ride to a local restaurant for lunch.   My kind of day!
We spent the afternoon doing chores, and I went to the post office to send food ahead to Monson, and then back to the restaurant for wing night.  12 wings and a cheeseburger with fries did the trick for me!
We talked through our plans for the next few days before it was time for bed.","Pierce Pond Lean To

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600795,"After the last few days of steep, rocky track it was nice to see a gentle smooth only slightly uphill trail for the first few miles of the day.   Maverick took off like he was shot out of a cannon and I was a bit ahead of Kilo after a while.  
It was a nice day with the forecast calling for late afternoon rain.  Midday, we had views back to Avery Peak and The Bigelows; I always love looking back at what I’ve hiked.  The scale and distance are remarkable-all these little steps and climbs really do add up to great distances.  
I ran into 3 southbound hikers, and exchanged trail names with the last one, Holcomb who said he reads my journal and also is a blogger on Trailjournals.  Nice to see you Holcomb, best of luck on your journey to Hanover!
I made easy time to the Lean to at 3:30.  No sign of Maverick, so I set up my tent and cooked an early dinner.   The rain came at 5:15, gently at first and then steady.   Having made all the preparations for rain, I got in my tent and made some notes and dozed for a while, then woke up and journaled a bit before going to sleep at 8:00.  
It rained buckets overnight. So hard for a really long time.  It was loud and I laid there thinking about how muddy The Trail would be and worried about the rivers I had to ford tomorrow.  Eventually it quit raining and there were just drips from the trees the rest of the night.","Caratunk

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600901,"I was pretty dry in the morning all things considered.  I had some splash that made it into the tent and my ground sheet was pretty dirty, but otherwise things were in good shape.  I was able to get my kit packed and eat breakfast and stayed mostly dry.  
Kilo and I decided we’d give it a go and push for Monson in one day, despite the muddy stream we were walking in.  We also had to ford several real streams and two branches of the Piscataquis river.  The second one was just over my knees.  Both were about 50 feet wide and not flowing too terrible to cross.  My boots and socks were soaked early in the day, so when it was time to ford, I just plowed through without changing to my crocs.  I did unbuckle my pack, a recommended safety procedure in the event you go down you can get it off before it takes you under.  
The terrain wasn’t too bad for elevation and there were even some smooth sections, just not enough of them.   I got cell service and called Shaw’s and added a night, and thankfully they had a room available.  As it turns out, it was a separate “suite” in the owners home over their gear shop.  I lucked out. 
I made it to the parking lot for pickup and there were two other hikers waiting for a ride and Kilo was close, so we waited for him.
We got to Shaw’s, at 6:15, got settled and caught up with Maverick.  He hiked the entire way from Caratunk to Monson yesterday, arriving st 10:30 PM after 36 miles and camped in the parking lot.  Shaw’s fetched him this morning.

We went for barbecue and got offered a job clearing brush from the bartender’s property, but politely declined.  After lunch we walked back and I took a nap for a while before dinner at The Lakeshore House.

I ran my 100 Mile plan past Poet afterwards and he gave me some suggested tweaks and gave me the rundown on a food drop bucket.  I resupplied in the shop there and then when Maverick and Kilo were ready, we got our bucket together and labeled.   The food drop would be at Jo Mary Road on the afternoon of Day 4 of the 100 Mile Wilderness, at about 60 miles in.  That gave us a 3-4-3 to carry-3 breakfasts, 4 days of snacks and 3 dinners.  We split the $80 cost of the drop, so it was a no brainer to not have to carry enough food to make it the whole 100 miles, especially since the first miles had some decent climbing.  
We ate sandwiches for dinner from the general store and built a fire at dusk.  About 15 hikers sat around the fire swapping stories and chatting for a couple of hours before bedtime.","Monson

On the way he gave us more to think about in terms of really enjoying the last days of our hikes and true to his trail name recited some poems that he wrote that were really special.  The group naturally split up and separated, with a few people gone in minutes, never to be seen again, and others passing each other the rest of the day.
I’m not sure it was really any different than other parts of Maine, but it felt really adventurous to be the HMW.  It was fairly gentle terrain  with a lot of roots and rocks to negotiate and one ford, where I changed into my crocs.  There were a few beautiful ponds that The Trail took us around.  I’ve been super cautious of late-getting so close to the end that I don’t want to risk injury, so it took longer than I expected to reach a beautiful camp spot next to a stream. I got there at 4:30 and got set up.  Maverick was already there and Kilo came in a little bit later.

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601758,"Today started cloudy and quickly turned wet.  I had to go over The Chairback Range and we had agreed that we’d meet at the Chairback Lean-To and decide whether we’d stop or keep going. 
Maverick was in front and I got to the Lean-to at about 2:00; it was packed with about 10 people staying out of the rain.  No Maverick.  I asked if anyone had seen him and someone told me he had used the privy and moved on.  Based on the day he hiked 37 miles into Monson, I assumed he decided to just go ahead.  I waited under the eave of the Lean-to for Kilo and he got there about 2:30.   It turns out that Maverick was in his tent in the woods behind the Lean-to.
The rain started to let up, so Kilo and I decided to move out and go down the steep descent of Chairback.  Poet had suggested that we do that on fresh legs.   We were cold and shivering, so got our rain coats on and made the steep trip down a rock scramble that was challenging, but relatively short.  
We found a spot to camp a few miles later and got set up.   The rain came again right as we were making dinner so I ate in my tent.  It was damp  but not cold and I knew that the next few days looked clear.  Before I went to sleep I looked at my AT Guide and realized that we had a stream ford right away in the morning.  I crossed 2100 miles on The AT today, it’s getting close to the end.","Stealth Site at 2090.8

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601759,"Kilo and I got moving at 7:00.  It was not raining and it was obviously going to be a stunning day.  We left camp in or crocs to avoid having to change shoes to cross the river.  It was an easy ford just below the knees.  
Right after the river we entered an area called The Hermitage, a beautiful forest with a gentle wide smooth path for almost 2 miles.  We had a long uphill climb afterwards and passed the Gulf Hagas loop trail.   
As we climbed another hiker came passed and said that Maverick was behind us.  Wow.  We thought he had abandoned us the prior day and we’d eventually catch up with him.  We stopped at a rock with a K and an arrow painted on it.  If you stand on that rock, you can just see Katahdin for the first time.  A little flutter of excitement!
Maverick caught up there and we all talked about how we had missed our meet up yesterday afternoon at the shelter.  He had been hiking since 5:00AM. 
We went up Whitecap, our last big climb before the end (we thought!) 
We took a side trail and had a great long distance view of Katahdin!  We could also see all the way back to The Bigelows, I love that.  There was cell service up there, so I made us reservations for a camp site at Abol Bridge for Sunday night and Millinocket on Tuesday and texted with Shaw’s to confirm our food drop for tomorrow afternoon.  We’re locked in to summit in Tuesday!  5 days. 
We descended Whitecap and headed towards the East Branch Lean-To.  We carried water and looked for a stealth spot, but the terrain was not cooperative; it was beautiful with lots of moss covered rocks, but camping would be impossible.  We eventually got to the Lean-to and there was a great spot for all 3 tents and we got set up and ate, hung our food and got our gear dried out before sleep.","Stealth Site at 2106.7
",East Branch Lean-To,"Aug 23, Thu",16.40
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601760,"Because we had pushed a little further the last couple of days, we had a short day today.  We had about 12 miles to hike by 3:30 to meet our food drop.  We were there by 1:00.  On the way, we stopped at Crawford Pond for a break at 10:00 and enjoyed an easy pace over great track with lots of pine covered path and puncheons.
We crossed Jo Mary Road and found Poppins, a 2017 Thru-Hiker set up with trail magic.   He had beer, soda, Gatorade, candy bar, chips, and apples.   My food bag was literally empty at this point; all I had was coffee and drink mixes, so I was able to fuel up while waiting for the food drop.  
The food drop arrived right on time thankfully ( I would have been in big trouble if for some reason it didn’t show up).  I dropped it into my pack and took off.  I cruised the 4.2 miles into Antler’s Campsite in about an hour and 15 minutes.  I was sweating but was purposely pushing my limit to get to camp.  
I got set up and Maverick and Kilo came in after.  I went down to the lake and went in up to my waist and changed into dry clothes and then back up to my tent to hang my clothes and cook dinner.  
Lots of other hikers rolled in at and after dark and found spots to camp and quieted down pretty quickly.  We’re in a little end bubble that has us a little concerned about crowds at the summit. More on that later.","East Branch Lean-To

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601839,"As I hiked this morning, I was enjoying the quiet of the forest.   Occasionally I heard the chatter of a little red squirrel scolding me for daring to walk through his woods.  They have a big attitude; Maverick thinks that when we walk by and they yap at us, they think they’ve scared us away.  Once in a while a frog would jump into a muddy pond or mud puddle or stream as I walked by.  The  path had lots of rocks and an occasional section of smooth pine covered trail and  there wasn’t much elevation so my pace was pretty good and I made good time. Something was blooming in the forest, maybe the acres of green moss covering everything, because I could smell a flowery aroma. I couldn’t figure out what it was, (but knew it wasn’t me!) but it was pervasive.
The Trail was suddenly difficult and challenging. Lots of roots and rocks.  
A surprisingly steep but short climb up Nesuntabunt kicked my butt and had me sweating and wondering if I had somehow lost my trail legs. I think maybe it was the heat.  We got a murky view of Mt Katahdin from a side trail and then 5 miles of mostly downhill with some climbs up the sides of bluffs and finally to Rainbow Springs Lean-To.  We found mostly flat spots for our tents and did our nightly chores.  We were all tired from a big mile day that was harder than we expected.  There were quite a few people here, so again we discussed our strategies for finishing outside of a big group.  We have been discussing a potential night hike of Katahdin to get a peaceful time with “the sign”.","Antler’s Campsite

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601845,"About 20 minutes out of camp I came around the corner and there were two other hikers standing there giving me the shhh sign.   I crept up The Trail and saw that they were looking at a big bull moose eating at a stream 30 yards away!  Psyched!  He was just standing there in the creek munching away.  I  got a nice view of him - he’s a big boy with a nice rack on him.  Maverick a Kilo came a couple of minutes later and I repeated the sign and we watch for a few minutes.   When one of the first guys left, the moose looked up at us and seemed concerned, we speculate that he thought he was being flanked, and moved awY from us into the brush.  He disappeared quickly although he didn’t move fast.  I’m so lucky to have seen him.  Trail magic!
As expected, the track turned flat at about the 13 mile mark, which is where we were waiting for it to turn and finally we got our wish.  As I walked along the shore of the lake I could hear loons calling their high-pitched call.
I moved ahead of the others and stopped a couple of times for a break, but only for 10 minutes or less each time.  I rolled into Abol Bridge via The Golden Road, at 1:15, checked into our campsite, bought a styrofoam cooler, ice and beer and went to set up.  I wanted to surprise Maverick and Kilo when they got there with an ice cold beer.  
We finished the 100 Mile Wilderness.  We had only the one day of rain and were blessed with fantastic scenery and long distance views.  
The guys got in by 2:30 and we all set up our tents on the same site.  We had a direct view of Katahdin.  
We decided that I’d walk to the edge of Baxter Park and get the specifics of the registration process for The Birches campground which only accommodates 12 hikers a day and is first come-first served.  I walked the .8 mile and looked at the  information and was back at the campground by 4:30 to do laundry and get dinner at the restaurant there.  I bought a few things for resupply at their store and then headed down to the camp site.  
We had a nice big campfire and decided we’d leave by 6:00 AM to secure our spot on the list for Tge Birches.   We didn’t know how many others would be trying, but figured (correctly!) that if we got up that early, we’d beat most of the millennial crowd.","Rainbow Springs Lean-To

We sat right there and made our coffee and ate breakfast before we left for our short hike to our base camp.  It was less than 10 miles, a stunning day weather wise and the terrain was essentially flat.  The Trail took along side the Penobscot River and then beside a tributary with many waterfalls and beautiful rocks.  
We were at the Katahdin Stream ranger station at 11:30, where we paid $10 to camp at The Birches, a campground only for Thru-hikers and got our permits to climb Katahdin.  The ranger, Nick, gave us lots of good information on the mountain and trails up and down before we set off to set up for the last time on The AT. 
I was permit number 526.   I was 518 at Amicalola and 316 at Harpers Ferry.  
I took about an hour nap, then went back the quarter mile to the ranger station stream for water, had an early dinner and tried to get to sleep at 7:00- our plan was to leave at 2:00AM to get to the summit for sunrise.

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601850,"I was awake at 1:15 AM and heard Maverick packing and Kilo moving.  I got up and packed.  I ate a packaged pastry and chugged a drink of carnation breakfast essentials with two instant coffee sleeves mixed in.  A barred owl squawked st us loudly as we were getting our packs on.  The moon was 2 days past full and it was clear!   We left camp at 2:03. 
I dropped my main pack at the ranger station and went with a day pack borrowed from the ranger.  I only carried water, snack, my SPOT device and my rain jacket.  I wore my headlamp.  I was light and amped on adrenaline.
Our little parade of 3 went up the rocky trail, which progressed to a stream bed, then boulder climbs and finally a mile long boulder scramble complete with rebar handholds and treacherous climbs to reach The Tablelands.  I could only see what my headlamp illuminated, so wasn’t encumbered by my fear of heights; I guess not knowing was better than being able to see and imagine what might happen.  The tablelands was a long boulder strewn path.
I could see “the sign” from pretty far away in the mist.   My heart jumped and I got a catch in my throat.  This was it.  I had walked 2190.9 miles over the last 179 days and the objective was within sight.  
I don’t remember walking the rest of the way- and then I was at the sign.   This was the largest elevation climb in quite a long time-4200 feet, but the time flew by.  I put my forehead on the sign for a few seconds in a brief contemplative moment and then kissed it, as is tradition,  before climbing up for pictures of triumph!
A faint red glow was on the horizon; Only 3 of us there in a mist.   After pictures with the sign, a couple of other NOBO Thru hikers showed up and the wind blew stronger. The sun broke through the clouds and we got an amazing sunrise with shafts of sun flowing down and behind the Knife’s Edge. Sick.
I put a rock that I had taken from Springer Mountain in March, 2017 on a giant cairn of similar deposits from other locations.  I carried that rock from Springer to Fontana last year and then from Route 89 to the Canadian border in Vermont last July and then the entire AT this year.  It will stay on Katahdin now.  
It got really cold in the steady wind that came after sunrise, so I got my jacket on.  We hiked back down after about an hour on the summit.  We took The Abol Trail down; it’s steeper, but the boulder scramble is shorter.  It started raining and the rocks got slippery, so I slowed way down.  Eventually I hit a dirt track section that had lots of switchbacks , and I put music on an cruised the last hour and a half to the bottom.  I regrouped with Maverick and Kilo and we walked the 2 miles back to the ranger station.  The price of the easier trail was the 2 mile road walk.  
Nick the park ranger radioed for a shuttle for us.  Unbelievably, the driver turned out to be Josh Saint, the former owner of The Hiker Hostel in Dahlonegha GA.  I reminded him that had given him a Got Wood T shirt last year and we chatted on the ride to Millinocket.  
Typical of all town stops, after getting checked in at The AT lodge, I exploded my pack, found the cleanest clothes I had, showered and went immediately to find food.  I had not eaten much since waking up at 1:15 AM, so was hungry and destroyed a burger and fries at The Appalachian Trail Cafe.  Laundry and a beer followed lunch, then dinner later and a typically early night as I was finally coming down from the excitement of the day.  
I did it!! I’m a thru-Hiker!

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602063,"My feet and knees are getting less sore each day.  I’ve shopped for a few new clothes that fit after my 50 lb weight loss.  I’m focusing on how to keep the weight off.  I’m not sleeping great yet-still waking up at 5:00 and cant go back to sleep and then gassed at 9:00 PM. Bottom line is that recovery is slower than I thought.     
A recap of the adventure: Over 179 days,  I walked 2190.9 trail miles, plus I’m guessing about another 150-200 miles in town, to get water or to shelters that aren’t “counted”.  I climbed and descended over 515,000 feet in elevation.   I went through 3 pairs of Solomon Ultra X hiking boots and a pair of New Balance trail runners. 
I hiked through a blizzard, thunderstorms, sub-freezing temperatures, and record  heat waves.  I saw black bear, moose, ""wild"" ponies, rattlesnakes and copperheads. I suffered Giardia, blisters, chaffing and numerous cuts, scrapes and bruises and fell about 25 times. I lost all of my toenails on my right foot.  
By the end of the trip, I was “dialed in” on food weight and resupply, ending up “in town” with very little food, which is exactly where I wanted to be.  My gear was essentially the same as what I started with except for my winter stuff that I sent home.   
What I read in preparation for The Trail indicated that the mental aspect of a long distance hike is paramount.  I agree completely. My body changed as I completed more miles and got my “trail legs” and my aerobic endurance increased to levels I haven’t seen since my teens.  I still had to push myself, especially on those long uphill climbs and in places that required me to take risks that I would normally avoid, and get up and do it all over again the next day.  There were days where I wasn't sure I could continue.
I took 25 days off as zero days.   My average daily miles hiked was 12.24 for the whole trip and 14.23 for the days I hiked. My longest day was 22 miles and my shortest day was 2.1 miles when I road walked from Norwich to Hanover across the Connecticut River.   Here’s a further breakdown:

I am incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to complete The Trail. I am thankful for the support that I got along the way from trail angels who gave me trail magic at exactly the right time. I am thankful for the 1000’s of volunteers that built and maintain The Trail and clear the thousands of trees that fall every year.  I met 100's of people along the way and they really were the show.  This path is nothing short of amazing.  
I am thankful that I met Maverick: we hiked two thirds of The Trail together.  I hope we’ll be brothers for life after our shared experience. A reminder to see more of the journey on YouTube: Maverick71 (Appalachian Trail, not the car!)
