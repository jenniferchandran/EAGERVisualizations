Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581837,"My name is Carl Hagelin. I am planning to start my modified NOBO Thru Hike of the Appalachian Trail on Sunday, March 11, 2018. I've been thinking about this hike for easily 15 years. Now at the age of 66 and freshly retired in March of 2017, I hope to realize this dream.Here's how my NOBO hike is a ""modified NOBO"". In order to avoid the anticipated crowding of facilities accompanying a traditional Springer to Katahdin hike with a mid-March to mid-April start, I've split the hike into three sections. While still a completely northbound hike, I'll be starting just north of the Smokies. It looks something like this.1) March 11 - start at Davenport Gap at the northern border of the GSMNP in NC2) Late April - jump back to Springer and hike to Davenport Gap3) Sometime in May - skip over first section and continue on to Katahdin

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581839,"On December 13, 2017 I drove up to where the AT crosses Rt 17 in New York and hiked north through the Lemon Squeezer to Fingerboard Shelter where I camped overnight.  It was drizzling and then snowing on my hike in and very cold and windy overnight.  I woke to 10 degrees and who knows what with the wind chill factored in.  I slept in my hammock and here's what I learned:
1)  My gloves where inadequate for temps this low.  My fingers were so frozen in the morning that I couldn't use them to stuff away my shelter properly for tie my shows.  I ended up using my fists to push my gear into my pack and tied my shows with square knots instead of bows.  I have since purchased a pair of down-filled mittens.
2)  Though I kept just warm enough wearing ALL of my clothes including a down hoodie and my rain shell, my feet were cold all night long.  I was wearing ""possum down"" socks.  I've decided to take these on my hike along with my pair of down booties that I had set aside in favor of the socks.January 2, 2018, River Edge, NJ

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581840,"My biggest fear going into my 2018 thru hike attempt is my right foot.  I've suffered from plantar fasciitis off and on for 20 years.  It started while training for my third marathon back in 1998 and it ended my long-distance running.
Long story short, back in July I was playing tennis and jammed my right heel going after a ball and it hurt like hell.  Since then I've been to three podiatrists, am wearing custom orthotics and a heel lift for my right foot.  I think I've figured out that rest seems to be the best course of action as exercise like walking or using the moving stairs at the gym seem to make the pain worse.
I felt I needed a significant shake down hike back in September so I hiked for 2 weeks on the AT from Front Royal, VA to Boiling Springs, PA.  I learned a lot and really enjoyed the experience but I don't think I did my heel any favors.
I am hoping these next couple of months bring my heel into hiking condition.  I REALLY don't want to delay this hike!

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583403,"Since I'll be starting my thru-hike at Davenport Gap at the northern boundary of the Smokies, I'm flying from New York to Knoxville on Friday March 9 to spend a day with two old college chums who live down there.  Ruthie and Ellen will drive me to Davenport Gap on Saturday the 10th and I'll walk three short miles to Standing Bear Hostel where I'll spend the night and take off northbound on my hike.
Gear decisions keep coming!  I had decided to use only AquaMira drops for my water purification, but just decided yesterday to carry my small Steri-Pen as my primary and use the AM drops as backup.  Funny how I got my base weight down to 20 lbs and now that the start is around the corner, I find myself adding things back that I had removed.  Like carrying both down-filled mittens and my OR gloves.  Like carrying my down booties in addition to my possum down socks for sleeping.
I spent the night near one of the shelters in NJ a couple of weeks ago to see how my new hammock would work in the cold.  It got down to the mid teens overnight and while I managed to keep most of me warm enough, my feet were cold all night in my possum down socks.  And with just my OR gloves, my hands were so cold I couldn't do all the packing chores in the morning.  Hence the down mittens.
So my pack weight is creeping up, but it's still lower than when I did my two-week shakedown back in the fall.
My new hammock is a bridge hammock from Jacks-R-Better.  I like the comfort.  I'm a bit concerned about the fact that my old Clark hammock had a shell in addition to the bug net so I could close myself in for the night.  This new one only has a bug net so I'm pretty much exposed to the wind and cold with just a tarp above me.
I'm really looking forward to meeting other hikers.  Leaving my wife for 6 months might get a tad lonely.

It’s hard to describe the emotions running through me as I took those first steps. I’d been anticipating this day for so long and then it’s here.  I did a brief selfie video but was kind of at a loss for words.
I met some nice young northbounders at the Hostel last night. They wished me well as I set off this morning.
Many thanks to Ruthie and Ellen for putting me up in Knoxville and driving me to the trail. Such fond memories of our college years together.

I was aiming for a 13 mile day until I ran into Fresh Grounds and his Leapfrog Cafe. He’s a trail angel who takes care of hikers. He was serving chili and grilled cheese sandwiches right there on the trail. The hot food was most welcome!  Fresh Ground convinced me to set up camp there at Lemon Gap and have hot coffee and banana pancakes in the morning. The wind was howling like a banshee all night.

Nice to have cell service! My feet are doing surprisingly well especially given a nearly 16 mile day.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584789,"911 - As I was about to start hiking out of Erwin a man walked up to me from outside. He said he was extremely cold and dehydrated and would I please call an ambulance. I dialed 911 and explained the situation and an ambulance was summoned. Turns out this guy is known for drinking large quantities of hand sanitizer and passing out in the mountains. 
It was a cold and windy day highlighted by summiting a bald called Beauty Spot.  Amazing views including Mt Mitchell to the east, the tallest mountain in the eastern US.  But it was so cold and windy; a few quick photos then off we went.  It was another few miles to a tenting area where Ringo and Reboot had set up their tents in the snow.  I couldn’t hike any further so I set up my ridge line, tarp and hammock over 6 inches of snow. It was so cold that I skipped cooking a hot meal and even attending to my oral hygiene. 
It took a while to get warm in the hammock and longer for my feet to warm. My hammock mates included a liter of water, my wet shoes in a plastic bag, and extra clothes should I need them. My second liter of water froze solid as would have my wet shoes.  I awoke to 15 degrees. Breaking camp was a cheerless exercise.  I was the last one out at 8:30.","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel

It was a long 12 miles in the cold and wind. I had to stop and change layers as the trail switched between the windward and leeward sides of the mountains.  I nursed my one unfrozen liter of water and hiked mostly under hydrated and under nourished. My right foot slowed me down in the afternoon. 
A passing hiker informed my of a winter storm coming tomorrow so I opted to stop a bit short and head to a hostel. 
My tentative plan for tomorrow is to leave here late and hike a short day to the next shelter and try out sleeping inside the shelter. Stay tuned.","Beauty Spot tenting area

Spent the morning at Greasy Creek Friendly with Derwood who decided to take a full zero there. Ringo and Reboot left at 8:00 to brave the storm.  I ate one of my prepared dinners for breakfast and took a mashed potato concoction from the hiker box for lunch. 
Last night’s dinner was a gas. There’s one tiny takeout joint in this little town. Window service only. For $12.99 I got a Frisbee-sized double bacon cheeseburger, a mound of seasoned fries and a salad (half order) so big I couldn’t finish it. Gotta love the South.
I left at 1:00 for an easy 2.6 mile hike to the first shelter. That includes the .7 mi walk back from the hostel. As I type I’m trying out my first in-shelter night. So far so good, but another storm is coming tonight through noon tomorrow.
In the shelter with me is Miz Man, Hawk, Hickory, Little Pasta and her dog Harvest, and a man from Ewing, NJ.
Fun Fact:  a woman left a message for me on trailjournals saying she hiked the AT under the trail name Farmor. She’s a “father’s mother”.  First person who’s recognized my trail name. My own mother, Lee, is Farmor to all of my nieces and nephews.","Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584937,"Didn’t sleep well in the shelter last night. I was cold all night. Had a hard time tucking my quilt around me to keep out the cold air. Also I was uncomfortable on my back on the sleeping pad. 
Cooked a breakfast and was out at 8:30. I had a big climb and 10 miles to Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT.  I loved the morning. Temperature was perfect, the mist gave way to blue sky as I gained elevation. I found the most perfect spot to stop and have lunch. But then came the afternoon. The temperature rose and all the snow we’d been hiking through for the past week started melting, fast becoming slush, then streams of icy cold water. It became impossible to avoid and soon enough I was walking in ice water over the tops of my shoes. 
I stopped at the shelter, but decided to move on. It was too early in the day and I didn’t know how I’d get my feet dry and warm. I changed into dry socks and slipped my feet into plastic bags and into my soaked shoes and hiked on another 2 miles to Carvers Gap where I called Mountain Harbor Hostel and asked to be picked up. As we were pulling away we spotted Derwin and he was happy to join us. Our plan is to have them shuttle us back to Carvers Gap in the morning and we’ll slackpack the 14 miles from there to Mountain Harbor we skipped today. Slackpacking is hiking with just a day pack of water and lunch. We will leave our heavy packs at the hostel and spend a second night there.","Clyde Smith Shelter

My first slackpack
My first state line crossing: NC/TN
In yesterday’s post I mentioned that Darwood and I would hike the miles we missed yesterday from Carvers Gap to the hostel. It was both beautiful and difficult for me. The balds (open grassy round-top areas with amazing views) were beautiful with iconic vistas of the trail vanishing in the distance. But the trail was often ice or mud, so the footing was difficult and the going slow.  And the wind was fierce.  It took me eight and a half hours. 
I stopped at Overmountain Shelter, one of the most favorite on the trail, for lunch and ran into Miz Man and Hawk. Hawk had arrived there at 12:30 AM the night before after a long night hike using his head lamp.  This guy is two years older than I and far braver.  Check out “Hawk on the Appalachian Trail” on YouTube.
This hostel was voted best breakfast on the trail. I can heartily agree.
Planning 8.8 tomorrow and back in my hammock.PS Two more firsts today. Day 16 marks the longest duration backpacking trip for me.  Last Fall’s shakedown was 15 days.  The second first was walking on a bed of icicles. The night before, freezing rain had accumulated on the tree branches and at some point during the day as the temperature increased the ice fell to the ground leaving sometimes as much as 4 or 5 inches of tubular ice cubes on the trail. It was kind of fun to walk on.","Carvers Gap

French toast, egg soufflé, tomato pie, ham, sausage, fruit, biscuits & gravy, two homemade pastries and cookies. Coffee of course. I can’t imagine any other hostel beating them out for best breakfast on the trail.
All this hostel and town food leaves me with a very heavy food bag to carry.  I’ll bounce the food box sent to Boots Off Hostel up to Damascus, VA.
I ran into a trail maintenance crew cutting down dead trees when I arrived at the shelter. I spoke to a woman who appeared to be the foreman and she recognized me as Farfar from these posts. Pretty cool!  Also working the site was the famous Bob Peoples.  This gentleman is a major AT celebrity.  Google away if you’re interested.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585225,"They say the Trail provides. Well I got two tastes of that. One last night and one this morning. Last night as the three of us were setting up for the night, a young hiker couple came down from the trail to ask if anyone lost a pair of gloves. It happens that my gloves have an optional wind-proof skin that I’d been using that day, both of which had slipped off while my gloves were hanging from my water bottle.  By the time I noticed they were missing I was in no mood to retrace my steps to go look for them. (It’s a documented fact that northbounders are loath to take any southbound steps.)  These young hikers went out of their way to see if the gloves belonged to anyone at the shelter.
Then another example in the morning. As I mentioned yesterday, I stupidly ran out of fuel and had resigned myself to eating only cold food till my next resupply. My shelter mates, a retired couple, saw me drinking cold coffee and inquired. I explained my predicament and they pulled out a large fuel canister they said they could spare and gave it to me, even refusing my offer of payment. “I’m sure you’ll have an opportunity to help another hiker up the trail.”  I’m sure I will. 
Of course it’s the people, the trail community, that provides.  I hear and read about this all the time.
I’m stealth camping tonight for the first time. I got to my target shelter at around 2:30.  Knowing I had a long day tomorrow to get to Boots Off Hostel, I decided to hike on till around 5:00.  I’m glad I did because now I have but 10.6 into Hampton, TN and the hostel. I’ll try and get out early to get the most from Boots Off which I hear is a good one.

Today’s hike took my to Laurel Falls. Big, powerful, noisy water. Quite beautiful. It was a steep hike down to the falls. I marvel at how the trail builders fashion steps out of the rocks. 
Hiking over Pond Mountain was another matter. A seemingly endless uphill slog. I was exhausted. I stopped near the top for lunch which helped and the long hike down to the hostel, though long, wasn’t too steep. I arrived before 3:00 and had a welcomed shower.  I’m waiting for the dinner shuttle into town.
Yesterday and the day before I stopped and had lunch at a waterfall. Beat that, city slickers.
I’ve got two plans for getting to Damascus and my second zero. A 3 day plan and a 4 day plan. I’d like to try for the 3 day but it has two back-to-back 16 milers. We’ll see.

I’ve been having my own little Holy Week here on the trail. I’ve listened to the Bach St. Matthew Passion and the St. John Passion as well as hymns and organ music. Really quite moving.  The forest is my cathedral. 
Actually I’ve been enjoying classical music in general as I have plenty of time to listen to multi-movement symphonies and the like whereas at home, who has the time to sit and listen?  It makes me happy and I occasionally conduct with my hiking sticks.

Looks like my three day “Road to Damascus” plan is working out. Only 10 miles into town tomorrow. I’m hoping to stay at Woodchuck Hostel two nights and enjoy my second zero. I should be able to get in by early afternoon so it’s really a zero and a half.  Will anything be open on Easter Sunday afternoon?
Durwood is planning to do a resupply in town and move on, so I may not be seeing much of him up the trail. He’s a far faster hiker.  He thinks Miz Man and Hawk are a day behind us so maybe I’ll see them in town on Monday. 
The water source at this shelter is described as “a steep .2 mile downhill”. That’s an understatement. It was a long tough climb back up with my water bottles.  And there are no water sources before or after this shelter for miles.

10x12, you ask?  Steve “Mighty Blue” Adams who thru hiked the AT a few years back had set a goal for himself of hiking 10 miles by 12 noon each day. I like that idea especially since I’m a morning person. Today I hit that goal by hiking the 10 miles to Damascus by 11:45. 
Woodchuck is a nice hostel. I’ll be here two nights, taking a zero tomorrow.

I was really impressed with Mt Rogers Outfitter today. Lumpy took real good care of me, fitting my pack and doing a repair on my hammock. Wouldn’t take any money either. The Trail provides. 
Trek is here at Woodchuck today. He’s 63 and is hiking his tenth AT thru hike. He knows a thing or two about the trail so it’s been fun and informative talking with him. I also heard today that Mountaineer Shelter where I stayed and met Bob Peoples was built in one day by 150 hiker volunteers.
I enjoyed a nice chop salad lunch at Mojo’s. One doesn’t often get salads on the trail. Tonight there’s a shuttle to the grocery store where I’ll fill out my food bag and grab something for dinner. 
I want to get out early tomorrow. I need to get up and over Mt Rogers on Wednesday as the forecast calls for cold overnight temperatures and 56 mph gusts. That means 16.2 tomorrow and 17.6 on Wednesday, and that over some very long climes. I do have a backup plan if that turns out to be too difficult.

It took me nine hours to get here today. Tomorrow I need to get up and over Mt Rogers to Wise Shelter, 17.5 miles. There’s a shelter atop Mt Rogers 12.3 miles away. It would be a perfect distance given the long and steep climb, but I simply can’t camp on top of the highest peak in Virginia when the forecast calls for temps in the 20s and wind gusts of 56 mph.  What makes this worse is that the miles after that shelter to the next one includes passing through the Grayson Highlands, a section I’ve been looking forward to for years. The area is home to the famous wild ponies and some beautiful countryside. Maybe I’ll get lucky and the weather will have passed by the afternoon when I hike through there.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585825,"Longest day yet, both in terms of miles and hours hiking. I left the shelter at 7:20 AM and pulled in here at 6:40 PM. Eleven and a third hours, 17.5 miles. That’s a measly 1.54 mph. Though I did have to climb over Mt Rogers, that wasn’t the worst of it. Coming down from Mt Rogers into the Grayson Highlands was probably the longest sustained rock hopping I’ve yet to encounter on the AT. And, because it rained pretty hard in the morning, the trail was very wet and muddy. There was a lot of hopping about to try and avoid soaked feet.  The forecast had promised rain in the morning and cold and high winds in the afternoon and night. A park ranger was citing 60 mph winds. I would have preferred a nicer day to see the Grayson Highlands, though the afternoon did offer clear blue skies.  Did I see the famous wild ponies?  No. Not until I got to the shelter and Gazelle told me there were three of them hanging out by the privy. I quickly snapped som pics. Gazelle is a fellow northbound thru hiker (NOBO).
I’ve got an easy 8.4 into Fox Creek where Fresh Ground has his Leapfrog Cafe set up. I can use an easy day after these last two.
I hope I don’t blow away tonight in this crazy wind.
Oops, I just heard from a southbounder that Fresh Ground has packed up and moved farther north. I guess I won’t be camping at Fox Creek (sad face).  I think the bubble of NOBOs he’s been serving move a bit faster than old Farfar.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Constant and loud, sometimes roaring. It was pretty exciting being out there in my hammock. It was 15 degrees in the morning so breaking camp and making breakfast involved short bursts of activity followed by walking around like a vagrant with my hands in my pants pockets to defrost my fingers for the next burst. My gloves were wet from yesterday’s rain and I can’t do much in my mittens.
I arose late this morning to full sunshine, a first for me as I always get up in the dark to get an early start. Today was just 11 miles so no need to start early.
Cold and wind aside, the day quickly warmed and the hiking was easy. I saw some beautiful sights along the way.  Trek passed me today working on his 10th AT thru hike. I walked through “The Scales” where once upon a time the cattle ranchers would weigh their livestock for market.
Brief history of the Grayson Highlands:  First the area was harvested for lumber.  When the trees were gone the area was used for grazing. The cattle ensured these high “balds” remained tree free with spectacular views. Then after the Forest Service took ownership of the land and the cows left, the trees started to return, threatening the uniqueness of the high balds. So in the 1960s ponies were introduced to graze and keep the trees from returning.  They’re hearty enough to withstand the harsh winters and, of course, the tourists love them.

I think the biggest contributor is the custom orthotics I’m wearing inside each of my trail runners. Not only do they correct for my super high arches, but being fairly substantial inserts, add a measure of protection from the countless rocks and roots I step on.
Both feet and legs feel great with no notice at all of PF pain for the first five hours or so of hiking. In the afternoons my feet start talking to me and my pace slows somewhat. But what’s great is that the pain free hours are getting longer. 
A night of rest always puts me right.

It wasn’t till late in the day that I checked my location and realized I could make it. It helped that the weather and terrain were perfect for a long hike.
This shelter is 0.2 mi from the road west to Marion, VA. I’ve planned to spend tomorrow night at a hotel there and pick up the box Joan sent.

I’ll use the day to plan my next section, do laundry, eat in restaurants, and fill out my food supply.

So it’s been a good day for a nero. 
I’ve sketched out a plan to get me to Pearisburg a week from today. It includes my first 20 miler.  I’ll be staying at Woods Hole Hostel there. I carry with me a list of the most popular AT hostels compiled from the opinions of 2017 thru hikers. So far I’ve stuck to that list and have not been disappointed. 
This morning I got a ride into town from the two young 2017 thru hikers who brought the case of PBR to Partnership Shelter last night, Keg Leg and Wrong Way.  I had planned on using Marion’s public transit bus but later had the opportunity to do so around noon when I used it to get to the laundromat. What a trip!  It took a full 45 minutes while I got to tour every square inch of Marion. The people who use this service are locals who either can’t afford a car or are unable to drive. Their accents so thick I had a real hard time understanding them. I’m glad I was paying attention when the driver drove right past the laundromat. When I pointed this out, he gladly turned around and took me there. 
It’s been maybe 45 years since I’ve visited a laundromat. I got my stinky hiking clothes into the wash and headed out to Wendy’s for some takeout which I wolfed down while keeping a close eye on the washer and dryer. Next I walked to Food Lion where I filled out my food supply for the coming week. They were well stocked with hiker food.  I walked from there back to the hotel in about 10 minutes. Definitely a better choice over the bus.  But I’m glad I got to see where people live in this town and I certainly wasn’t in a hurry.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586122,"I met two very cool hikers today at a very cool place. I came upon a sign welcoming me to enjoy some trail magic up ahead at the old one room schoolhouse. Sure enough there it was with a backpack on the porch. I shed my own pack and walked in. There I was greeted by a 77 year old man with a long white beard.  Loner Bohner, as he is known on trail, was proudly wearing three “2000 Miler” patches from the AT Conservancy. He is working on his fourth thru hike. He showed me the trail magic boxes, provided by the local Methodist church, from which I helped myself to a Pepsi, a package of cookies and one of crackers. The Lindamood schoolhouse was built in 1894 and was in use until 1937. Then along came Odie. He turns out to be someone I had heard interviewed last year on Mighty Blue’s podcast and the person responsible for publishing the annual Hiker Yearbook. The yearbook contains photos, trail names, real names, and contact info of AT hikers. This is such a valuable service because hikers pretty much only know each other by trail names and maybe what state they’re from with no means of contacting them later on. Hikers send Odie a photo of themselves along with the other info via a Facebook page, and he assembles and publishes the yearbook. 
I’m staying at the Relax Inn tonight. I know. I slept at a hotel last night. My choice was a meager 7 miles to the first shelter or a whopping 26 miles to the second. Many hikers stay here as a result. And trust me, only hikers would choose to stay at this $50 dive. 
Poor ol’ Loner Bohner. I just ran into him on my way back from dinner at the nearby Mexican restaurant, which by the way has the exact same menu as last night’s restaurant in Marion.  Anyway Loner is bummed out because he had heard he could resupply at the Sonoco station next door. Turns out they have only junk food. Now he has to wait till morning, take a taxi back to Marion and do his shopping there. That will get him off to a late start for sure. He became doubly disappointed when I informed him that The Barn, a restaurant here that serves a 16 oz. “hiker burger “, closed today at 2:00. He doesn’t like Mex food, and that’s all there is today. This part of the country takes their Sundays seriously. 
My hike today?  One of the best yet. Besides the fun encounters at the schoolhouse, the weather was perfect, blue skies, some magnificent views, and that pretty morning light showing off the fresh fallen snow from the night before. It was in the lower twenties until around 11:00 so I had to stop and swap out my gloves for my down mitts. I discovered that when my hands get really cold I can let my arms swing naturally at my sides while dragging my poles behind me. That way blood gets a chance to make it down to my hands. 
Oh, and today I walked past my 300 mile milestone. It’s starting to sound like a long way to walk.Do thru hikers carry TP?  Apparently inquiring minds want to know. (Hi Nate). The answer is yes, the vast majority do. Though I understand there are some Leave No Trace purists out here who insist on leaving only natural products behind, buried in 6 inch deep cat holes. I heard an interview with a guy who, to save weight, doesn’t carry TP but instead rips the back page out of shelter journals and uses it. Seems to me not much better than using wax paper.  A means of fecal distribution rather than removal. Ew.","Marion, VA

Then I discovered that the coffee machine at the gas station next door was broken. There stood the Barn Restaurant just up the hill with their lights on. It was 6:53 and they opened at 7:00. Score!  I ordered the “hungry hiker special”. Eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries and pancakes.  Did I mention the real reason I’m hiking the AT?  So I can eat whatever the heck I want. 
But then, an hour and a half into my hike, I reached into my back pocket for my AT Guide. I must have left it at the restaurant. It’s my main planning tool and I refer to it frequently throughout the day. I called the Barn and asked them to send it along with a northbound hiker. Sure enough, just after dinner a group of hikers arrived including Zello who asked if Farfar was here. I expressed my gratitude and offered to pay her in trail currency: a Snickers bar. She readily accepted. 
Today was snowy in the morning with only a light drizzle later on. It was very overcast all day.  But that can make for some nice atmospheric photos.  You know there’s a photo gallery in addition to the one I post with each journal entry. 
Today I passed a sign marking the quarter way point of the trail. Of course for me it wasn’t the quarter as I will be going back to hike the first 214.4 miles of the trail at the end of this month. 
While stopped for a lunch break I had a phone chat with my brother Dan. He wants to hike a section with me during the summer, possibly starting in Salisbury, CT. He’s an avid hiker himself. My brother Nate has also expressed interest in joining me, perhaps at the top end of Virginia starting at Front Royal.  Their company will enrich this experience, no doubt.
Tomorrow is my son Ryan’s 29th birthday. I wanted to call him tonight in case I had no cell service tomorrow. But alas, no service tonight.
Tomorrow is also my first planned 20 miler. There’s big ol’ Chestnut Mountain in the way with 2000 feet of elevation over 4 miles. Hopefully that means a sustained, but not too steep of a climb. 
It’s nice to be back in my hammock after three days away in a shelter and two hotels. Don’t get me wrong, I like sleeping in real beds. But compared to trying to sleep in a shelter, my hammock is a dream.

It also happens to be my son Ryan’s birthday but with no cell service again tonight I can’t call and wish him a happy. I did manage to get a text message to him earlier.
It also happens to be my first 20 mile day. Boy, did I pick the wrong section of trail for that. I knew I’d be climbing up Chestnut Mountain in the morning. It was long and often quite steep but I was rewarded with lovely views up top and the shelter up there where I and others stopped for lunch was quite unique. It was completely enclosed, unlike most shelters which are three sided. It had bunks and two tables inside.
The afternoon wore me out. From the elevation profile it looked like small ups and downs, but reality had me ridge walking over and in between never ending rocks and the trail chose to go up to the top of every little peak. There was scarcely any smooth trail for me to make good time on. There’s a term on the AT, PUDs. Pointless Ups and Downs.  I lost steam and began thinking I’d need to stop early.  Finally late in the afternoon I got a second wind when the trail leveled out a bit. I rolled in just before 8:00 after more than 13 hours of hiking. So it’s not 20 miles as much as what kind of 20 miles.

The terrain was just about rock free and much of the day’s elevation changes were gradual. I woke later than usual to Peewee dropping off my food bag and didn’t hit the trail until a lazy 8:30. 
While I was taking down my hammock, one of the guys tenting near me asked me if I knew about Brushy Mountain Outpost, a small store/deli right on the trail about 10 miles up. They make burgers, fries, and BLTs and have some basic hiker resupply stuff. At 2:00 I showed up and enjoyed a bacon cheeseburger, fries, root beer, and a double scoop of peach ice cream. Much better than a pouch of tuna in a tortilla. I shared a table with Squeeze and Sawdust.
I needed to do some re-planning after I learned from Joan that she’s sent a box to Woods Hole Hostel, 11 trail miles south of Pearisburg. I think I’ve come up with a way to stay there one night, then hike into town and spend a night at a hostel there.  My stinky clothes and body need a washing.

But I need to build up my stamina. It was an 18 mile day and I was pretty worn out by the time I reached Dismal Falls. There’s no shelter here, but lots of water and a few nice camp sites. I’m listening to the falls as I write. 
Lunch came early as I stopped at around 11:00 at Jenny Knob Shelter. There I met a young hiker named Gandolf who’s from Lancaster County, PA. I asked him if he knew Mt Gretna. Not only did he know about it, his family used to swim at the lake there.
Growing up, my family used to visit our cousins there each summer. An old Chattaqua town, the village is filled with these wonderful old cottages and the lake had some pretty wild man-toys to play on. A super high diving platform, a high dive, an adult-worthy slide and a trapeze up on a high platform that would make any insurance salesman cringe. In fact Gandolf’s father lost a tooth when the trapeze bar collided with his face. As a boy it was a measure of courage each year to see how high I could swing before launching myself into the air.  Gamdolf’s brother is an architect and took part in building an elaborate model of Mt Gretna out of Gingerbread. I must Google that one.  My uncle, Jack Bitner, was the town historian.
I’ll be staying at Woods Hole Hostel tomorrow night after a 13.4 mile hike.

There were no humans near me.
This is a really nice hostel. Neville, the granddaughter of the founder, put together a nice dinner of soup, salad and homemade pizza. I pitted the olives and, of course, was the chief dishwasher.

I was grateful that after more than a month on the trail I had yet to take a fall.  I’m looking forward to breakfast with their home roasted coffee.

I was a bit worried about the big long descent into Pearisburg, but it turned out to be long, but not that steep. I made the 10.6 in 4 hours. Strangely today was the first time I got to actually hike with someone for more than a minute or two. Second Chance from Georgia and I hiked together for at least two hours and never stopped talking. We naturally hiked at the same pace. I really enjoyed it. 
Funny story. I had tried to talk to Joan last night from the hostel but couldn’t so I called her from the trail this morning. I heard her pick up the call and just then Second Chance came up behind me and said hello a half second before Joan said hello. It was disorienting. I had to hold two simultaneous conversations.
After the 1 mile walk into Pearisburg from the trail, we hit the Dairy Queen, now called DQ, for a 2:00 lunch and ice cream. Eventually Peewee and Helper showed up and the four of us walked to Plaza Motel. Trust me when I say this is not a Helmsley establishment. We had reserved the last two rooms. Dinner across the street at yet another Mexican restaurant. The evening ended with a bunch of hikers telling tales on the motel porch. 
I’m growing hiker legs. My calves are something to behold. I was happy that nothing hurt on the long descent today. Not my knees or my feet. I did feel a burn in my braking muscles in front, just above my knees.

My hands never warmed up. Because of the huge rains the day before, the trail itself often became a little stream with occasional mini waterfalls and the many stream crossings were swollen with fast moving torrents of water. 
Peewee, Second Chance, Helper and I were driven to the trail head at 7:00 AM saving us a mile of uphill road walking. Early on I came to a stream crossing too wide to hop over and any rocks that might have offered a means for crossing were completely submerged. A quick dip began my wet feet for the day.
It turned out to be a bad day to attempt a 20 miler. Late in the afternoon I began to look for someplace to hang my hammock but finding nothing I decided to plow through the 20 miles to the shelter. I had learned along the way that said shelter had been closed by the Forest Service due to an infestation of gypsy moths that had killed the trees near the shelter making them susceptible to falling on unsuspecting campers. The shelter itself, being made of stone, seemed safe enough. By the time I arrived there was only one skinny spot left. I got to sleep beside Honey and Moon who, you guessed it, were on their honeymoon. I slept miserably, shivering for the first hour or so and very uncomfortable. 
The best (read worst) part of the day came just a few tenths before the condemned shelter. Another stream crossing. This one was a whitewater affair maybe 15 feet across and roaring so loud you’d have to scream to be heard. If a clearer head had prevailed I would have taken the time to remove my shoes and socks and put on my camp shoes. But I was tired, cranky and my shoes were already pretty wet so I just walked in.

Impossible for  me anyway. Three young hikers skillfully crossed by balancing on a few skinny logs laid across the stream. They all waited for my crossing offering helpful instructions and words of encouragement. I knew I would fail as soon as I discovered how slippery the logs were. Sure enough, two steps in and my feet slipped from under me and I went down on my butt with my pack providing a softish landing. I scooted the rest of the way after handing my poles to the helpful hikers. That’s officially fall number one. 
The morning was cold and windy. Yesterday’s socks were frozen and now my dry second pair were soaked. I had a long climb that kept me warm but again I was slowed by the frequent water hazards. 
I stopped for lunch at the first shelter which cheered me up. Spirit and Cinco were there. After lunch I saw I had cell service so I had a nice chat with Joan who filled me in on the big storm I’d been living through. She had it too up in north Jersey.

Then came the longest, steepest clime I’d yet to encounter. If you could have seen me you’d think I was climbing Mt Everest, plodding along at a very slow pace and gaining a foot or less with each step. Looking up was always disheartening as I would see nothing but more of the same till the trail turned.  It didn’t help when young hikers would zip past me.
But all tough challenges on the AT come to an end and I eventually made it to the shelter. I probably shouldn’t mention that the shelter was 0.4 miles down a steep hill.  I don’t want to sound like a complainer. 
The shelter was actually very nice with a big front porch over a big picnic table and I had it all to myself.  I cooked a hot meal, got into my comfy hammock, hade a nice conversation with Joan and was just about to call my buddy Steve when, as the last of the day’s light was fading, along comes Tennessee with a friendly “Hi Farfar”.  I hadn’t seen him in almost a week.","War Spur Shelter

It was nearly two hours of climbing but mostly not as steep as yesterday. There were lots of switchbacks which helped. I kept myself well hydrated and I had a dumb tune on a loop in my head that was in tempo with my strides and I tried to keep the tempo steady even when the going got tough. 
The hike on the ridge of Sinking Creek Mountain was particularly memorable and challenging. It wasn’t so much a trail as it was the rocky top of the mountain.  The views to the valleys both east and west were spectacular.  Some rock climbing was involved which on occasion had me on all fours. The traverse was fun but oh so slow.  That and the long climb got me to the shelter at 6:30 after an eleven and a half hour day.  By the time I set up camp, fed myself and hung my food bag it was 8:45.
About four miles before the shelter while still high on the ridge I visited the Audie Murphy memorial just 100 feet off the trail. Audie was WW2’s most decorated serviceman. He died in a plane crash near the site.
The weather today was cold and windy. It stayed around 40 degrees and the howling wind made it feel much colder. Not a good day to be up on the ridge. I wish it would warm up.

It’s also known as a very challenging steep downhill boulder fest where one sometimes stares in disbelief. How will I get down this one?
My own personal experience with Dragon’s Tooth was disappointing to say the least. First I missed the sign for the 0.1 mile blue blaze trail up to the Tooth itself with the great views. Instead I proceeded down the AT and at one of the very steep rock piles I slipped and then tripped on my poles and fell face first into the rocks. I slid a bit after landing and jammed my right hand between two rocks with all my weight pressing on it. I was pretty shaken up. Immediate assessment was that everything was working. Just my hand felt beaten up. Lucky for me there were two day hikers heading up who saw me fall. They helped me get my pack off and sit me up. Mostly I felt scared and upset thinking about what could have happened like broken limbs or a broken head. Just after they left Tennessee came along and ushered me all the way to the hostel. He is a good man and friend and I really value the care he gave me as I could not use my right hand or pole to get me down the rest of the way.
We arrived at Four Pines, which by the way is a three port garage converted with bunks, a kitchen and a shower that takes only voluntary donations, opened the door and there were my buddies Peewee, Second Chance and Helper with welcoming squeals of delight. It made me feel so much better. Then a call home to Joan helped me purge some tears. Falling on a steep rocky downhill has always been my greatest fear on the AT.
The hostel offers a free ride to the Homeplace restaurant. They serve family style and all you can eat. Our table of four included Second Chance, Helper and The Dude, a nice young man from Arkansas taking a year off before starting college. 
Tomorrow I’ll stay at the hostel and continue icing my hand. I feel like I can probably hike again the next day.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Still a bit swollen and bruised, but I feel ready to get hiking again tomorrow morning. I’ve got a three day plan to Daleville, but honestly it’s a baby plan born out of caution that I hope I can better. I’ll be hiking with Second Chance and Helper and they’re looking at a two day plan to get there. Daleville is the end point of the first part of my three part thru hike . If I get there in two days I’ll be two days ahead of my original plan. I’ll need to decide whether to hike two more days or head to Georgia two days early. 
It was a lazy day. I did finally manage to sew the button back on my pants.  Dinner was back at Homeplace which I think was a mistake. I’d rather have grabbed a burger at the local store. I’ve loaded up on oatmeal and snacks. Peanut butter crackers are the best. So are Cheeze-its.  Trail cravings. I hike to snack.

The weather was perfect and the clime up to McAfee Knob was neither steep nor rocky. After stopping for lunch and water at the shelter just before, I arrived at McAfee Knob. I was so excited to be there. The two most iconic photos thru hikers are sure to capture of themselves are 1) perched atop the trail terminus sign on Mt Katahdin and 2) peering contemplatively into the valley while sitting at cliff’s edge on McAfee Knob. I’ve seen literally hundreds of them. To finally be there in person was truly thrilling. Second Chance took my photo and I took hers. After Helper arrived we had a local day hiker snap the three of us together. 
After spending a good half hour there we hiked down to the next shelter and called it a day. We had plenty of time and energy to hike farther but the next shelter was up and over Tinker Cliffs and we probably wouldn’t have made it there till maybe 7:00. So we’ve left ourselves with a 15.4 mile day tomorrow and rain is predicted after 10:00. We’ll start hiking at 7:00 to try and get over the Cliffs before they get too slippery. I hope we’ve made the right decision. 
Up at McAfee Knob I met another hiker who asked me my name. Turns out she’s been following my journal. Always nice to hear that. 
I made reservations at a hotel in Daleville for tomorrow night. I will take a Lyft or Uber to Roanoke to rent a car for the ride to Nick’s in Tucker, GA. He’s free on Friday to drive me to Springer Mountain so I can get started on leg two of the hike on Saturday, April 28.","Four Pines Hostel

We had our share of climbs, but much of the day was downhill. Fortunately my knees held up. 
Second Chance, Helper and I were joined at dinner by Camo. We ate at a renowned BBQ joint here called Three Little Pigs. The food was outstanding with free banana pudding for hikers.

After assessing my food needs to my next resupply point which will be at Mountain Crossing at Neel Gap and seeing what food I had left, I made a list and hit up the local Kroger. As usual I came home with more than needed and loaded up with my favorite snacks. Mountain Crossing is the first resupply spot on the trail. At mile 31, it’s a full service outfitter known for helping greenhorn hikers by conducting pack shakedowns after which literally tons of unnecessary gear gets shipped home each year. It’s also the spot where some hikers call it quits.
I called my eye doctor back home to have him call in a prescription for Cipro eye drops. I explained that I thought I’d acquired an eye infection but he thinks it was more likely irritation from wearing my contact too long without giving my eye a rest. I wear only one contact to correct for distance. The naked eye I use for reading and inspecting for ticks.

I stopped for lunch at Gooch Mountain Shelter and wanted to get to this campsite because the next two shelters are in a “must camp with a bear canister” zone. No thru hiker carries a bear canister so lots of hikers stop here, just before the zone. But rolling in after 5:00 left me with little to choose from in camp sites. I ended up at what might be the last spot. I found two trees suitable for hanging my hammock, but they’re up against a steep drop off. After I hung the hammock it dawned on me that I wouldn’t be able to pitch my tarp, the drop off being too steep for me to secure the guy lines. So I’m left to the mercy of the rain gods to spare me. The forecast calls for no rain.
I hit 500 miles this morning which feels like a big milestone. The woods down here in northwest Georgia seem to be celebrating my achievement by displaying the most beautiful wildflowers I think I’ve ever encountered. They stop me in my tracks. 
My right heel is acting up. I stopped a couple of times and removed my shoe so I could give myself a nice stretch which seemed to help. The problem is that it slows me down and it takes longer than I’d like to put in a 16 mile day like today. It took over ten hours.  I’d like to be able to do more twenty milers but I don’t like getting to camp late.  I’ll try more stretching.

Up and over Blood Mountain today.  At the top sits one of the oldest shelters on the AT, Blood Mountain Shelter. It was built in 1933 by the CCC, the year the AT was completed. It’s a four sided stone structure which is now listed in the National Historical Registry. 
I felt strong today powering up Blood Mountain and with more attention paid to stretching, my foot held up pretty well. But today’s hike was only 7.2 miles. I have an ambitious goal for tomorrow to go 18.8 miles. So much depends on the terrain and what’s underfoot. I’ll make it to Hiawassee in three days in any case. But I’d like to arrive early to get town chores done.  I’ll be crossing into North Carolina on my first day out of Hiawassee.
Mountain Crossings, where I’m bunking tonight, is another interesting place. It too was built by the CCC in the 1930s. Today it is a full service outfitter, very well stocked, a hostel featuring a bunk house, shower, toilet, kitchen sink, frozen pizzas they’ll cook for you, but no laundry facility. What’s very cool is that the AT literally runs through it, passing under an archway.  The only such hostel on the AT. Located at mile 31, it’s also the first outfitter new hikers encounter. Wisely they offer a free pack shakedown service sending over a ton of unneeded gear back home each year.  There’s also a big old tree festooned with hundreds of discarded hiking boots.
The weather is perfect and the wildflowers continue to dazzle. Nick told me about a phone app called iNaturalist which works great at identifying both flora and fauna. I’ve identified trillium and columbine thus far.","Lance Creek campsite

That’s 10 miles by 12 noon.  At my slow speed, particularly in the afternoon, I need to start early and push out the morning miles. 
I passed my first hikers today. Being so used to hikers passing me, this was a big deal. Were they young thru hikers?  They were neither. It was two old lady day hikers, though I could tell they were deeply impressed. 
Nearly 19 miles today. It was going pretty well until the last two miles which consisted of steep climbs and a rocky horror show. I was a zombie walking into the shelter. Tomorrow I’m shooting for 15.5 miles which sounds doable except that the elevation profile is devoid of any flat sections. It’s thousand foot ups and downs pretty much the whole way.  But if I can do it, it’s less than four to the road to Hiawassee the next day. That way I have most of the day there for town chores. 
More wildflower identification today thanks to iNaturalist. I’ll post pics.
And gnomes. I ran into a cute gnome home this morning. My second gnome encounter. The first was on the short little stretch I hiked with Nick and Bash. Bash loves gnomes and will be thrilled to learn they’re a thing on the AT.

My brother Nate thinks readers might be interested in learning about some of the gear I’m carrying, clothing I’m wearing, and some of my food and snack favorites.  I’ll begin here with a note about my shelter. I sleep in a hammock. It’s a bridge hammock from Jacks R Better. Rather than the typical hammock with the fabric gathered at both ends, a bridge hammock has a spreader bar at both ends and the fabric is suspended from the ends of the bars. I think it makes for a more comfortable lay.  It has a bug net which allows me to look out and it keeps most of the wind out. I pitch a tarp over the hammock. It’s a Dyneema (cuban fiber) tarp made by Z-Packs. For insulation I have a down underquilt that hangs under the hammock so that my body weight doesn’t compress the down. It’s also from Jacks R Better. Inside the hammock I have a 20 degree down quilt from Katabatic. On really cold nights when I’m expecting temps below 25, I have a Thermarest Neoair inflatable sleeping pad that I inflate part way and slip between the hammock’s two layers of fabric.  The pad can also be used on nights where I choose to sleep in the shelter. The pad is a shortie, mostly just covering my torso and butt, so shelter sleeping is not comfortable.","Mountain Crossings Hostel

Taking down tarp and hammock, making coffee and oatmeal, putting on my hiking clothes and shoes, brushing my pearly whites, and visiting the privy all in an hour and a half under headlamp lighting seems ok to me. Since I go to bed early I don’t mind getting up early, especially when I have a big day. 
Today’s 15.5 took me over three big mountains. Rocky Mountain, Tray Mountain, and Kelly Knob, each featuring over 1000 feet of elevation. I was surprised to check the GPS at noon to see that I’d hiked 10.9 miles. My third “10 by 12”. I was thinking that with the two climes of the morning I’d fall short. 
I’m happy with the power and speed I can muster and sustain during the first five hours or so. With breaks for stretching and snacks I feel like a real thru hiker. I’m hoping to be able to sustain that strength further into the day such that 20 milers can happen more frequently. 
Arriving at the shelter at 3:30 I realize I could have hiked the additional 3.6 to Dicks Creek Gap and the road into Hiawassee, but I’d arrive too late to do the town chores and I don’t want to stay two nights for a zero there. I’d rather hike the short distance tomorrow morning and stay just one nigh, calling it a nero (near zero) instead. My first zero on this leg of the journey will be next week in Franklin, NC, a much more fun town. 
Town chores for tomorrow include laundry, shower, pick up the box Joan sent, resupply, and plan the next section into Franklin.
Today’s photo (when I can upload it) is of one of my favorite flowers I often see on the trail. Bluets are little blue flowers that grow in clusters. Their thin delicate stalks cause them to dance in the breeze in the most charming way.
Here’s a fun fact.  As of today I’ve completed one quarter of the Appalachian Trail.  The AT is 2190 miles.  Hurray for me!
As I write this there are a few people around the shelter’s picnic table chatting and laughing, probably while preparing and eating dinner. Part of me thinks I should be more social and join them. But I chatted with the earlier dinner group and would rather be in my hammock.

Yesterday I wrote about my shelter. Today my clothing. I hike in a light weight wicking short sleeve t-shirt and a long sleeve synthetic shirt over that. Even though afternoons have gotten hot, I wear the long sleeved shirt. It protects my arms from the sun and breezes pass right through it. It also makes for less real estate for bugs. I hike in REI convertible pants, these days with the bottoms zipped off. I like the four pockets, two with zippers. On chilly mornings or when it’s cold I add layers. I have a light fleece hoodie and a rain shell. Mine is waterproof with a hood and pit zips which I always leave open. I keep my Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer down hoodie in a waterproof stuff sack to wear at camp. In a separate stuff sack I keep camp clothes. A light weight marino wool long sleeve T, possum down socks for sleeping, spare undies, spare hiking socks, Patagonia rain pants, and a Buff.
On my feet I wear Altra Lone Peak trail runners, thin liner socks with 5 toes, Darn Tough shorties aver those, and light weight gaiters. I like to keep dirt, sand and pebbles out of my shoes.

I hitchhiked into town and was picked up by the third car, a lovely couple out for some mountain biking. Unfortunately my good luck was tarnished by my leaving my trusty green hiking cap, all sweaty and salt-encrusted, in their car. I had to venture out and buy a new cap with a dumb fishing company logo.  I don’t even fish.
I’m staying at the Holiday Inn Express which in the AT Guide shows the AT symbol which I think means they have hiker rates. Turns out they do, but at $150, I wonder what their normal rate is. That’s expensive for down here. 
I got a shower and laundry done in short order. They’ve got coin operated machines here. Lunch was a dismal burger at Hardee’s. Each time I took a bite the burger patty would slide out due to the excess of gooey material included. Dinner was at an AYCE (all you can eat) joint nearby called Daniel’s Steak House. The buffet offered no steak but the salad bar was decent as were the fried chicken and ribs. Why is it that almost every time I order lemonade the wait person warns that it’s pink lemonade. If they’re so ashamed of their pink lemonade, why don’t they just serve good ol’ yellow lemonade?  Then they can dispense with the apology. 
My resupply was minimal due to the food box that Joan sent. Just Pop Tarts, Orios, and paper towels. I stole a few sheets of TP from the hotel.

I had a bigger model that I liked, but this one is lighter and everything fits in it just fine. Osprey is by far the most frequently seen pack on the trail. My stove is an MSR Pocket Rocket. It screws directly onto the fuel canister. My cook pot is a 4 cup GSI for which I fashioned a cozy out of Reflexit material. This way my dinners don’t get cold while I wait 10 minutes for them to fully rehydrate after taking them off the stove.  The Pocket Rocket stows nicely inside the pot.

This morning I got a ride from a trail angel named Encourager. He picked me up at the hotel at 6:45, just enough time for me to ravage the free breakfast buffet. He’s a real nice retired gentleman and he sent me off with a prayer for my safety. Then a short way into my hike I thought about the hat I had left in the car of the couple who drove me into Hiawassee. I had told them not to bother mailing it to me, but I changed my mind and called Andy and asked him to mail it to my home in NJ so Joan could include it in the next box. Andy graciously agreed to do so. Thanks, Andy. I’d heard so much about Southern hospitality on the trail and was experiencing it in spades.
After the high of passing into NC, I refilled my water bottles, walked past the famous gnarly tree (the most photographed tree on the AT), and headed up from Bly Gap. I’d heard horror stories about its difficulty which is good because it wasn’t as bad as I’d feared. It was indeed very steep, but it came in two parts, neither of which were agonizingly long.  Checking the GPS at noon I’d hiked 9.2 miles which isn’t bad considering I didn’t start till 7:10, 40 minutes later than I like to start on long days. 
I saw my first pink lady slipper today. My collection of wildflower photos is getting pretty impressive. Hop over to the photos section if you want. 
Thanks again to those of you who’ve written in my guest book. I really enjoy hearing from you. One reader asked if I’m seeing many hikers on the trail now that I’ve jumped down to Georgia. I’d say I’m somewhat surprised to be seeing as many new thru hikers as I am. But still the majority are section hikers or people out for a few days. By the way I am thru hiker number 2440. That’s on the official tag I picked up at my start at Springer Mountain. Now that doesn’t include southbounders or anyone else who hasn’t yet been to Springer. The ATC guy there estimates between 3500 and 4000 thru hiker attempts this year. The number grows each year. Typically only between 25 and 30 percent actually finish.

Yesterday, when telling about my cook system I forgot to mention that I carry a two cup insulated mug. I use it for coffee and other hot drinks and it’s got cup and ml markings for measuring water.
Now onto some miscellaneous gear. My poles are Leki Carbon-Lites which I’ve had for four or five years. They are in three sections and tighten to my desired length by twisting. They’re holding up well. I can’t imagine hiking the AT without poles. I carry a small bug net which I’ve yet to use. I imagine I’ll need it in MA and VT. My headlamp is a Night Rider which recharges via a USB port. No batteries to buy and carry. I carry an Anker battery pack to recharge my phone and headlamp. It’s got two output ports and is good for at least three full iPhone charges. As for water treatment, I always purify my water. I use a SteriPen, the smaller model called the Adventurer. It’s a UV light that I submerge into the water for 90 seconds. It imparts no taste and even kills viruses.  It runs on two lithium batteries which last about four weeks. I’ve tried various filtering products but have always been frustrated with them clogging. I have not tried the Sawyer Squeeze systems which are by far the most popular method on the trail.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589280,"Two valuable lessons were learned from hanging my hammock too close to the shelter. Lesson one. You risk being subjected to the shelter snorer. The sole occupant was a freshly retired man with one of the loudest and non-stop snores I’d ever heard. I may as well have been in the shelter.  By morning he was alternating between silence and such awful sounds that I feared he might be dying of oxygen starvation. What if he dies, I was thinking, and I had to call 911?  How would that impact today’s miles?  Lesson two. You are in the domain of the shelter mice. Because I get up so early, I set up my little kitchen in my camp rather than risk waking shelter sleepers. This morning I had a small platoon of them running in and out of my headlamp’s beam. They are brazen and well practiced in the art of thievery. I found one taking inventory inside my food bag. 
Today was to be 16.3 miles with 7.2 tomorrow into Winding Stair Gap and the road to Franklin. When I was atop Albert Mountain and finally had cell service I called the hostel in Franklin to reserve a room. Zen, the owner, said he was picking up some other hikers at Winding Stair Gap at 9:30. So rather than have 7.2 to cover by 9:30 I hiked on to the next shelter 3.4 miles down the trail leaving a much more manageable 3.8 in the morning. 
This all made for a 19.7 mile day. Most of it was easy going except the climb to the fire tower at the top of Albert Mountain. It was my steepest climb yet with big rocks to scramble up. It reminded me of Dragon’s Tooth but this time going up rather than down. I find it much easier and far less scary going up rather than down. Fortunately the hike down the other side of Albert was very tame.  By the way, 11.3 by noon.
There’s only one other person here at Rock Gap Shelter, a young guy who seems not to want to engage in conversation. It can get lonely out here sometimes. But it was nice that the aforementioned Zen, the  Gooder Grove Hostel owner, came by taking his two pooches for a walk. I’m excited to be in Franklin which has the reputation as being one of the coolest hiker towns on the trail.

Food. What do I carry in the way of meals and snacks?  For breakfast I have packets of instant coffee to which I add powdered milk and stevia, a plant based sweetener. I often prepare two pouches of instant oatmeal, flavored. When I’m sick of oatmeal I have Pop Tarts. A typical lunch is a pouch of tuna and a packet of mayonnaise on a tortilla. That’s often followed by another tortilla with meat and mayo. The meat has so far been hard salami or pepperoni. In one of my early prep posts I wrote about the dehydrated dinners I’d been making. Joan sends them to me at hostels. When I run out of these I use Knorr pasta or rice sides to which I add some meat. So far these meats have held up ok over 3 or 4 days hiking. They may not fare as well in the heat of summer. Maybe I’ll try the packets of Spam slices. Yum.
Snacks. My favorite snack turns out to be the packets of six peanut butter crackers. They hit the spot. They’re crunchy, salty, and the crackers taste a bit sweet. I like Cheese-Its. I like nuts, particularly Smokehouse almonds. I carry Cliff bars. I like that there are so many versions, particularly the nut butter filled ones.  Jerkys are good and add protein to my diet. I sometimes buy Snickers or some other candy bars but so far I like having dark chocolate and some cookies.
Peanut butter is one of most common trail foods. It’s calorie to weight ratio is one of the best. But I don’t carry it. It’s too thick by itself or in a tortilla. Someone mentioned they add frosting to it. That sounds good. Maybe marshmallow fluff. 
I’ve already scoped out the best burger place in Franklin. Expect a full report.","Standing Indian Shelter

I had to relocate my gear back further into the shelter as the rain was getting blown in. 
With only 3.8 to the 9:30 shuttle into Franklin this morning, today’s hike was a walk in the woods, blessedly cool after last night’s rain. Gooder Grove is a nice hostel. I’ve taken a private room with its own half bath. At $43, a bargain. 
After showering and laundry I walked to Motor Company Grill for the promised excellent burger. The wait was way too long and the burger was ok, not great. Same with the vanilla shake. Afterwards I walked to The Lazy Hiker Brewery and joined my fellow hikers with an excellent IPA. They have a food truck which the hikers said serves good food.
I’m down to 190 lbs. Maybe I should write a book when I get home. “How to lose weight by simply exercising 8 to 12 hours a day”.  A sure bestseller.
I walked with some other hikers to the other end of town to get some dinner. It was a longer walk than I was expecting and I was wearing my camp shoes without  my orthotics. Not a good idea. We went to the other brewery in town that also has a food truck, but being a Sunday the truck closed early. I decided to head off on my own and discovered a sushi restaurant nearby. I figured I’d eat sushi and take a Lyft or Uber back to the hostel. Lyft said the fare would be $6.50. Wonderful. But there was nary a Lyft or Uber available so I walked back. Always good to get a little exercise while thru hiking the AT. 
I haven’t decided whether to zero in town tomorrow or hit the trail at some point. I’ve already done my resupply but I need a lighter weight blanket for the warmer weather. My down quilt is steaming hot.

I haven’t mentioned my water bottles. Like most hikers these days I carry two one liter Smart Water bottles. They’re lighter than the sturdy Nalgenes. I have them attached to my front pack straps so I can get to them easily without removing my pack. I collect water at water sources with a one liter Nalgene wide mouth collapsible bottle into which I can submerge my SteriPen UV light.","Rock Gap Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589579,"I woke in my private room with my own bathroom undecided as to whether to take a full zero in Franklin. I like the hostel and I’ve yet to take a zero on this leg of the trip. But I’ve been here since 10:00 yesterday morning. Then I did the hilly walk into town and found the donut shop to be out of business and the outfitter, Outdoor 76, had nothing to offer in the quest for a sleep covering in warm weather. That cinched it for me. I’ll hit the trail today. I arranged for the town transportation bus to pick a bunch of us up from the hostel at noon and I was hiking by 12:30. 
It was 11 miles to Wayah Bald Shelter with the threat of rain all afternoon. The view from atop Wayah was an awe inspiring 360, made more dramatic by the threatening rain clouds. Three miles into the day I hit my 600 mile mark. In order to get six fingers into the picture I had to prop up the phone and use the ten second delay. Joan wonders what I’ll do when I hit 1100 miles.","Franklin, NC

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589589,"I’m rethinking the 10 miles by 12:00 thing. Today is a good example of why it’s become a problem. I started hiking at 6:45, a little later than my 6:30 goal. Because I made a few short stops in the morning and because I had some longish climbs, I wasn’t sure if I’d make that 10x12 goal. So when I crested Wesser Bald at 11:30 where the views were great, there was a fire tower to climb, and two friendly hiker ladies were going to climb the tower and have lunch, instead of joining them I hiked on to see if I could make 10 miles by noon. Yes, I made 10.6 and had lunch alone at a dank shelter. I missed a nice opportunity for views and friendly chat. Seems pretty foolish and OCD of me. I think a better goal is to get hiking early when I have a big mile day and allow myself the freedom to stop for lunch or climb a fire tower before noon. 
It was a tough day. The climb down Wesser to the Nantahala Outdoor Center was very long, often very steep and often rocky. It beat me pretty badly. I pulled in at 4:45 after nine hours of hiking. 
The NOC is a major white water center that attracts hundreds of kayakers and others each day. They have a hostel with bunks where I’m staying tonight. I had a big salad and a half pound burger at the restaurant there. 
After today’s arduous hike I’ve got a 16 mile day planned for tomorrow. The problem is that it starts with a 3000+ foot ascent. I’ll have to see how I feel after that. 
Last night I sketched out a plan to get me through the Smokies so I could coordinate a plan with my friend and trail angel Ruthie.  She’ll be meeting me just north of the Smokies to get me to a car rental for my drive back to Daleville, VA for the start of my third and final leg of this journey. After today’s hike I’m wondering if my plan might be too ambitious.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589681,"I brewed a pot of coffee and cooked oatmeal in the NOC hostel’s kitchen and got back to the AT at 7:15. Almost immediately I noticed pain in my left shin. The day before getting to the NOC was the longest continuous downhill of the trip thus far. Because it was the afternoon and my right heel was feeling its usual minor pain, I was favoring the right foot and coming down hard on my left. Today I paid the price. I was feeling shin splints for the first time ever. It was especially painful on even the slightest of downhills. My plan was for 16 miles but by the time I was a mile or so from the first shelter, I was hobbling at a snail’s pace and in considerable pain. So I called it a day at 12:45 after just seven miles. 
Google told me that the best course for curing shin splints is, you guessed it, RICE. Fortunately this shelter has a nice, close by piped water source with a rock seat just in front of the pipe. So I sat with my shin in the stream of cold water. My legs are naturally elevated when lying in my hammock. From Amazon I ordered a set of calf compression sleeves to be shipped to Fontana Dam and I’ll not hike tomorrow if the pain returns. That covers the whole RICE thing. 
This is my first stress injury and I’m not happy about it. My tentative plan to get me to and through the Smokies is scrapped. This is not the kind of injury I can just walk through. I’ll just take it a day at a time. 
On a positive note, the shelter is full of nice people, many of whom I’d met previously. 
I get a kick out of today’s photo. I had stopped to pull out some snacks and hung my two water bottles and poles and removed my pack before I noticed a crude bow was hanging on the same tree. 
A shout out to my cousins Bob and Joan. Thank you for your words of encouragement. Joan, though married to another Joan, you shall remain my one and only JWP.  And it’s been fun to hear from my other cousins, the not so horrible Hinchliffe’s.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589822,"Today marks two months on the trail, having started March 11. Too bad I spent the day staying at yesterday’s shelter resting and trying to heal my shin splints. I even wore calf compression sleeves loaned to me by Grasshopper. I hope to see her at Fontana Dam to return them and pick up my own at the post office. I know the day off was good for me. I just hope I can hike tomorrow. I’d like to get the nine miles to the next shelter. If it’s too bad I can get six miles to a road where I can call a shuttle to get me to a hotel. It does feel better, but not completely and I hope that if I take it easy I can do alright. 
It was interesting to me to be at a shelter during the morning hours as I’m usually one of the first out. The last hiker out today didn’t leave till 11:30 and by then the first of the lunch breakers had arrived. In fact I was never alone the entire day. Lisa came in for the day at 2:00 and soon others arrived. Those that came before 3:00 missed being out in the rain. It rained hard for about two hours. I had left my hammock and tarp up all day and watched as the rain and hail pummeled down on it. I’m happy to report that it stayed dry through the storm. 
All things considered, if I had to take a zero at a shelter, this was a good one. With a big porch overhang and a nice and convenient water source, I didn’t mind the stay. I took a nap at around 1:00 and with my feet naturally elevated on the hammock, I woke feeling better.
I’ve seen so many hikers these two days at this shelter, many of whom I’d met before. Lisa is one of the two women I mentioned on Tuesday’s entry that I saw at the top of Wesser Bald who I didn’t get to meet and have lunch with because of my compulsive need to make ten miles by noon.
I’m in bed early today so my leg can be elevated. I’ll try hiking tomorrow but won’t make an effort to get out real early as I doubt I’ll feel like a big mile day.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590010,"It was a leisurely morning packing up and having breakfast as I was pretty sure I’d be going only 6.7 to Stecoah Gap, Highway 143 into Robbinsville. Once I started hiking it was clear the shin splints were there and I needed more rest. I called a local shuttle driver who told me he was booked solid for the day as were the other two drivers he knew but that I’d have no trouble hitchhiking into town. 
Here’s the plan I devised with input from Joan. I’ll take two full days of rest in Robbinsville Saturday and Sunday, then take two short hiking days to Fontana Dam. There On Tuesday I’ll decide if I should continue on into the Smokies (Plan A) or go home to New Jersey for a week or two and come up with a Plan B for completing my thru hike.  Joan had pointed out that though I’ve always dreamed of that iconic finish atop Katahdin in Maine, by far my most important goal is to complete my thru hike. By taking two weeks off I’d be in danger of not making it to Katahdin in time. I’ll need to be hiking more cautiously, especially on the downhills, to avoid further injury.  I can always finish the missed southern sections later in the year. 
All that being said, I was happy with my hike today. Fast, powerful and pain free up the hills and by going extra slowly downhill I managed to avoid the painful experience of two days ago. I actually passed a few hikers and everyone I encountered from the shelter wished me well and offered encouragement. 
I met up with Emily/Groundhog Day at Stecoah Gap and within five minutes a young man in a pickup gave us a ride into town, taking us right to our hotels. That’s when we learned we were in a dry town. He told us each time it comes up for vote it stays dry. “Too many preacher types live here.”
I must have been dirty indeed because after drying off from my shower the towel was brown with dirt. Then to the laundromat across the street and to a family run restaurant for dinner. Back in my room I iced my leg and read my book.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

I took it slow on the downhills and managed to stay relatively pain free. It’s become apparent that my right foot with the plantar fasciitis tends to do better with regular hiking. When I take more than a day off it seems to hurt more when I resume. It would be nice if that were the case with my shin. 
There’s an Air Force guy at the shelter tonight who knew a good shin splint stretch but it takes a partner. He generously offered to do the stretch with me. He was a bit surprised at how stiff my legs are. I’ve become convinced that when training for a long distance hike it may be more important to become flexible through stretching and yoga than to work on strength. You get strong on trail by hiking. You don’t get flexible.  I probably could have avoided both the PF and the shin splints had I taken that more seriously. 
There’s just 5.5 into Fontana tomorrow where I’ll get a ride into the village and post office. Their hours are 11:45 to 2:45. I need to pick up my box from home with food and my hat and a package from Amazon with my calf compression sleeves. I’ll mail Grasshopper’s sleeves back to her. Thanks, Grasshopper.
Speaking of hats, when the driver dropped me off at Stecoah Gap this morning there was some trail magic there in the form of apples and bananas as well as a hat from Mountain Crossings. I swapped out my fishing hat for that one.
Because I arrived at the shelter at 12:40, I had plenty of time to myself this afternoon. It was a hot day and I hopped into my hammock under the shade of my tarp for an afternoon read and nap. For the first time I felt way overheated with my underquilt in place. I had to unclip it. Now that it’s after 8:00, I’m feeling a bit of a chill. CBS they call it in hammock circles. Cold Butt Syndrome. Time to clip it back into place.

I started driving home to New Jersey at 4:00 PM fully intending to take a hotel room along the way. But after filling the tank at around 10:00, I decided to drive through the night with a couple of brief rest area stops. I arrived home at 6:45 AM Wednesday.  The cats are happy to see me.

I’ll be hiking north through eight states to the AT’s northern terminus atop Mt Katahdin in north central Maine, around 900 miles. After fond farewells I headed off across the Delaware River into New Jersey. It was 40 minutes of road walking before I left roads and felt trail once again, including walking Rt 80 across the river with 18-wheelers speeding past me a scant six feet away. 
Altogether I spent 12 days at home resting which seemed to have cured the shin splints. It was so nice being home. Joan returned from her dive trip and took the next week off from work to be with me. I’m looking forward to finishing the hike when we can both be retired and do the things we’ve dreamed of. 
I met my first thru hikers this morning at Sunfish Pond, Shake & Bake and Froggy, who are flip-floppers. They said they’ve not seen very many traditional Northbounders, one or two each night. I would have thought there’d be more, including some with whom I hiked during my first section. I’ll look at the shelter logs for names I might recognize. They also said that the rocks of northern PA were as bad as they say. I’ll be experiencing them near the end of my hike.
No problem today with shin splints. The trail featured no major ups and downs, but it was very rocky. So much so that my progress was often quite slow and me feet began to hurt, particularly the right foot with the plantar fasciitis. I’m not much worried though because my foot usually hurts more at the start of a hike but then after a few days it calms down. 
Tonight I’m camping at the Mohican Outdoor Center. It’s run be the Appalachian Mountain Club. For $8.50 I have a camp site of my own with a bench and picnic table, bear boxes and a privy nearby.

But that leaves ten miles of nasty rocks to deal with. Joan asked me last night about the rocks. Are they like gravel?  No, they are not. These rocks range in size from softball to microwave. Sure, there are bigger and smaller, but these are the ones that are miserable to hike over. “Rock hopping” is not a good term as it sounds like fun. Makes me think of the children’s game of “lava” where you must hop from rock to rock as the ground is molten rock that would burn your feet to stumps. The rocks on the trail are often pointy and sharp and set firmly in the earth at random angles. Your brain needs to quickly process a lot of visual input to decide where each foot and pole should go next. On dirt or rock? The angles your poor ankles must accommodate would challenge the most articulated of action figures.  Progress is slow and your feet hurt after a while of this. It took me nine hours, including stops, to go 14 miles. 
Just four of us at the shelter tonight. Inspecting the shelter log I saw no names I recognized. A nice shelter but it’s set in a depression and the big rains of Sunday have left much of the grounds muddy and squishy. 
It was hot and humid today, in the upper 80s. My hiking attire is sweaty and soggy. Let’s see if they dry overnight. Tomorrow it’s supposed to be cooler for my 15 miler.

My legs and feet felt pretty good and I’m getting my hiking legs back after my twelve days of rest and sloth. 
Early on I crossed Rt 206 near Branchville during rush hour. Good thing Mr Policeman was there to usher me across. There’s a deli right there but it was closed. At around 11:00 I consulted the guide and saw that coming up in a mile was the Sunrise Mountain Pavilion. Great views both east and west, a roof to provide shade, and a bench sit on. I remember six years ago when I hiked the New Jersey section, stopping at the deli on 206 and buying a huge sandwich which I carried up to that pavilion. The hiker I had dinner with last night showed up and we had lunch together there. I shouldn’t have had the can of sardines because now my garbage baggie will stink till I get to a garbage can, which for me won’t be till I get home on Sunday. 
I called Greg, one of my old work chums and asked him to let my former work colleagues know about my journal. It was nice catching up with him. I’m hoping to see some Guest Book entries from old friends from the office.

I was planning to camp in the town of Unionville, NY tomorrow. But I think I’ll leave extra early tomorrow morning and stop there for lunch and resupply and then move on to the next shelter.

When I woke it was wet and foggy. My hiking clothes, wet from sweat, were still just as wet after hanging under my tarp overnight. I just love putting on wet cold clothes in the morning. After an hour of hiking it began to rain and continued till just before getting to Unionville at 1:00. Cheeseburger and a dog with kraut for lunch and a few snack items for the food bag. 
The walk from there to the shelter was unusual: a long road walk followed by an even longer walk around a very large marsh. I was glad to get back into the woods. Today also featured some very pretty pasture land with grass so tall it was clear that the grazing animals had yet to be invited to the feast. Today also brought another milestone: 700 miles.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592626,"Good hike today. Though I’d hiked this section twice before, I had forgotten just how amazing the Pochuck Boardwalk is and how crazy challenging the Stairway to Heaven. It was a 25 minute walk across the boardwalk, an elevated four foot wide walkway through beautiful marshland. I was treated to orioles and cardinals. They started building the boardwalk maybe ten years ago and they’re still expanding it. Much of the wood looked and smelled fresh. If you live in north Jersey and have not already done so, you must “Take a walk on Boardwalk”. 
The boardwalk is followed by a couple of miles of wide easy trail leading to the road crossing of Rt 94 near Vernon where a short walk takes you to Heaven Hill Farm where ice cream and baked goods can be had. I had a large cup of Graham Central ice cream and two homemade apple cider donuts warm from the oven. I could actually taste the cider. 
On the other side of the road the trail looked ominous with Wawayanda Mountain looking high and steep. It was about an hour of steady rock climbing to the top. I took it slow but kept moving the whole ride up the Stairway to Heaven. I didn’t remember it being so long and difficult. Must be like mothers having a second baby forgetting the pain of the first. 
I had my second fall today. This time I was not hurt at all. I slipped on some mud and landed face first in a large mud puddle. After the initial disgust at having mud all over me, including in my ear, I got up, resumed hiking and laughed at myself. I must have looked pretty funny. There were no streams prior to the shelter so I hiked a little beyond to the Wawayanda Park office, stripped down to my undies, and rinsed poles, bottles and clothing under the outside spigot. 
Good company at the shelter tonight. Kats, Leila, and Glider so far. Also lots of mosquitoes. So far I’ve been able to keep them at bay with Picaridin lotion. 
Here’s some breaking news. You’ll never guess who just walked into camp. Fresh Ground has arrived!  Bringing the best trail magic of the AT. You might recall that way back towards the beginning of my hike I ran into his food tent at Lemon Gap. He served both dinner and breakfast on one of the coldest days of my hike. What a guy.
And now Nate, Pepper Pot and Lucky 59 have arrived. It’s reunion time for Farfar.","Pochuck Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592747,"I felt a close sense of trail community today, much due to Fresh Ground’s Leapfrog Cafe. He was set up for breakfast at the Wawayanda parking lot just a short distance up the trail. Then again for lunch at the 17A crossing in Bellvale, NY. His trail magic brings hikers together. He made me a huge omelette, three apple pancakes with real maple syrup and of course fresh ground coffee made in a French press. Then for lunch two cheeseburgers, pasta salad and two cupcakes washed down with red Kool-ade. After lunch a group of us hiked a short distance to Bellvale Farm and had their homemade ice cream. This time s’mores and mint chocolate chip.
I hiked most of the morning with Lucky 59 and her husband Pepper Pot who, if he completes his hike, will be the first person from Guyana to do so. This is only the second time in my hike when I’ve actually hiked with someone. I enjoyed our conversation. Then, after lunch I hiked with Kats, a most interesting retired man from Quebec. He’s two years older than I and a better hiker. 
I had my third fall today. As in yesterday’s fall it did no damage. I slipped on a steep rock face and went down on my butt, my pack taking the brunt of it. Large portions of today’s hike was ridge walking with Greenwood Lake to our east. This involved many difficult climes up and down where I sometimes had to abandon my poles and use all fours. I have a fear of slipping and crashing down. At one point I noticed a blue blazed alternate route around a particularly difficult spot. They’re there for stormy days when it’s too dangerous to attempt the official route. Or for old people like me who are afraid of dying. I availed myself of one of these walk-arounds and am not sad that I did. Purists would scoff, but I need to do what I’m comfortable with. 
Speaking of slipping on rocks, I’m beginning to think that maybe the trail runners I’m using don’t have the best grip. I’m watching other hikers with more traditional hiking shoes that seem to grip better. I will look into new shoes on Monday while I’m home for a zero. 
Tomorrow Joan picks me up after a ten mile day where the trail crosses Rt 17 in Southfields. The last 0.4 miles is a nearly straight down 500 foot rock pile descent called Agony Grind. Five years ago when I hiked this, Joan, Dotty and Steve met me at Rt 17 and were aghast at how awful I looked. I was probably hungry and dehydrated. But I’m a better hiker now and hopefully won’t cause the same reaction. 
One more thing. I finished New Jersey today and crossed into New York. One more state completed, the third so far: GA, TN, and NJ.  Eleven more to complete, though NC is nearly complete and VA, by far the biggest state, is half done.","Wawayanda Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592946,"It seems the trail builders sought out the most massive rock faces and steepest grades to lay out the AT through these first 20 miles of the AT in New York.  Perhaps to ensure that the AT be not just the People’s Trail, but the Badass People’s Trail.  These past two days have left me wondering whether my own level of badassness is up to the challenge.  There were moments when I thought one little slip could leave me with broken bones or worse. It takes not only strength but agility, flexibility and good balance to navigate these challenging sections.  Youth helps too, but honestly I see plenty of older hikers moving faster and with more confidence than I.
Lying in my hammock after posting yesterday’s journal entry I realized that as of yesterday, at 732.7 miles, I’ve hiked one third of the trail.  Applying my keen math skills I have only 2/3 of the trail to go.
The past two nights have brought a lot of rain and I’ve been impressed at how well my Z-packs Dyneema tarp has kept me and my hammock dry.  Fortunately the rain has stopped before I had to pack up camp.  On such mornings I take down the tarp last so I can breakfast and de-camp under its protection.  I’m relieved that it hasn’t been raining during the day because as difficult as these rocks have been, they’d be downright treacherous if wet and slick.
It’s been a solid week of hiking, Monday through Sunday, without a town or hostel stop for a shower and laundry.  This made it especially sweet when Joan met me in Southfields to take me home for a zero on Monday.  We were going to give Glider and New Girl a ride into Tuxedo, but they opted to hire a taxi rather than wait for my arrival.  I had let them know that I’d be arriving well after them due to the return of my shin pain.
I’d been warning my fellow hikers about Agony Grind, the steep rocky 500 foot descent to Rt 17 in Southfields, having experiencing it five years ago.  But what I found was that it was not as difficult as I had remembered and not nearly as scary as the other challenges of the past two days.  Next up is the famous Lemon Squeezer where hikers must remove their packs to slither through a crack in a giant rock.  Also coming up is the more pleasant section of New York through Harriman Park and up and over Bear Mountain.  Maybe I’ll be singing the “I love New York” theme after all.","Wildcat Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593100,"I spent a good part of the day cleaning and drying my gear.  After my recent face plant into a mud puddle and with the rain and humidity of recent days, my pack and all of its contents needed some good airing out.  Joan welcomed me home yesterday with a feast.  All I had to do was grill the burgers and hot dogs and enjoy a couple of Long Trail Brewery’s Thru Hiker Ale.  I crashed shortly after dinner after yesterday’s 10 hour/10 mile day.  My left shin needs another rest so I don’t know how long I’ll be home.
They say never decide to quit on a bad day.  I don’t want to quit but, at the same time I’m beginning to think that I may need another approach to tackling the Appalachian Trail.  My shins have slowed me down now a few times to a speed that would make it impossible to complete the entire trail in one year.  I’ve always imagined myself doing the AT as a thru hike and was never much interested in being a section hiker, taking multiple years to hike the entire trail.  But the past two days of hiking in New York have been a wake-up call.  Could I get enthused about being a section hiker?  How would I feel were I to give up on my dream of being a successful thru hiker?  If New York has put me in danger beyond my threshold for risk taking, how will I handle New Hampshire and Maine?
I needed to reach out to a hiker friend so I called Second Chance, one of the two women I ended up hiking with during the first leg of my hike down south.  I knew she had attempted a thru hike last year and needed to stop and later decided to try and complete the trail as a section hiker.  I wanted to hear about how that transition worked for her.  She’s become quite comfortable with being a section hiker.  It turns out we share a common fear about the dangerous sections of trail and both would prefer not to hike New Hampshire and Maine alone.  We talked about the possibility of hiking together this year, both needing to do the northern two states.  And it turns out we both need to hike the Smokies.
So here I am at home with lots to think about.  There’s a former thru hikers who helped me out with a virtual pack shake-down prior to my hike who told me to call him should I start contemplating quitting.  I will do that.
I’ll let you know what I decide to do.","Home in New Jersey

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593211,"The more I thought about hiking the entire AT as a section hiker rather than a thru hiker, the more I came to like the idea.  I started to do some detailed planning about how I could complete the trail by next year by hiking an additional 500 miles this year and 625 next year.  I’ll go back on the trail to complete New York on Sunday for five days followed by ten days in Massachusetts.  Then I hope to hike New Hampshire with Second Chance in July and Vermont in August.
How will it feel to say “I hiked the entire AT mostly over the course of two years” versus “I thru hiked the AT”.  It doesn’t carry the same level of pride, at least for me.  But there are some definite benefits to taking the section hiker path.  Without the time constraints of a thru hike, I can take time off to rest my shins should they continue to flare up.  And I can target shorter daily miles to try and avoid this and other stress injuries.  There’s also the opportunity to come off the trail now and then to take part in other fun activities with Joan.
So yes, I’ve made a decision to hike the Appalachian Trail as a section hiker rather than a thru hiker.  I’ll be able to take pride in completing the entire trail, one of the most difficult long-distance trails in the country.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593637,"Well hello again. I’m back on the trail. This time hiking officially as a section hiker rather than a thru hiker. I’ve got plans in place that will have me finishing the AT next year, hopefully by summiting Katahdin. Rough outline as follows.
2018 - finish NY, hike MA, NH, VT and the Smokies 
2019 - finish VA, hike PA and ME
Happily I won’t be doing this all alone. Second Chance and I will hike the Smokies, NH and ME together. We’ll both be completing the trail next year. 
To complete what I’ve not hiked in NY will take just four days, today being the first. Christine, a long time friend who lives not far from here generously offered to meet me at the CT border where I left my car and drove me to today’s starting point. This way my car is waiting for me when I finish NY.  We hadn’t seen each other for quite a while and it was fun catching up. 
I’m wearing new shoes and they’re not trail runners. It’s risky wearing a new style of shoe without taking the time to break them in first. But so far so good. They’re Keen low rise hiking shoes, not waterproof. They have a sturdier sole and protect my feet a little better on the rocks.
With the car shuttling this morning I didn’t start hiking till after 10:00, getting me into camp here at RPH at 5:15.  And here’s the amazing part. When Christine dropped me off at Dennytown Rd, guess who was crossing the road at that very instant?  If you guessed Durwood and PT you’d be 100% correct. Last I heard I thought they’d be a day ahead of me. It was nice hiking with these two gentlemen and Durwood caught me up with the goings on of various hikers we both know.  The AT may be 2191 miles, but somehow it’s a small world. 
Pizza can be ordered and delivered to this shelter, but I passed on it. I’ve been eating home and town food for the past six days and the three of us stopped at Canopus Lake Beach where there’s a concession stand. I lunched on a hot dog and fries, two bottles of lemonade and an ice cream sandwich.","Home in New Jersey

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593726,"It was a short nine mile day today. Up at 5:00, hiking by 6:30, at camp by 12:15, and that’s including a one mile round trip detour south on Rt 52 to the Mountainside Deli. There were a bunch of hikers, including Durwood, who decided to visit the deli. He and I ordered bacon, egg and cheese on a roll. They were excellent, as to be expected in the state of New York. 
Really nice shelter tonight. The water source is a hand pump but the water still needs to be treated. I’m now lying in my hammock at 2:30 after eating lunch and making two trips to the well. It’s such a luxury to be all set up so early in the day, especially when the weather is perfect. I’ve got my ridge line strung but my tarp is draped over one end so I can look up at the trees. Should it rain, and it’s not supposed to, I’ll just need to pull the tarp over me and guy it down. Speaking of gear, I’ve got a new light weight down blanket which I used for the first time last night. It keeps me warm without the sweating of my heavier down quilt in this warm weather.  It takes up about half the space of my quilt in my pack. I think I’ll take it when I hike MA next week. 
There’s a guy named Robbie here at the shelter. We were chatting at the picnic table this afternoon and I asked him about how he’s able to take the time to hike the trail as he didn’t seem old enough to be retired. He said he was taking a break from his work as an opera singer and church musician in the Catholic Church. He was explaining how many people don’t realize that church musicians are often mercenaries who get paid. He was amazed when I told him that I too studied church music, went to Westminster Choir College and hold a Masters degree in choral conducting from Yale. Obviously we had a lot to talk about. He has a doctorate in voice from Manhattan School of Music. I never thought I’d run into another church musician on the trail. 
Lots of other fun people tonight. Holly and her daughter Trish got on the trail two days ago headed to Katahdin. There’s a curious man from Colorado who claims to have already hiked the entire AT and is doing it again. Yet he’s wearing a cotton t-shirt and blue jeans. He’s sleeping in a tiny light weight hammock and carries no tarp. 
I hiked through a short section of trail today that in my experience was quite unique. It appears that on this section the trail maintainers actually removed the rocks from the trail and stacked them alongside the trail. It was aesthetically pleasing to both my eyes and my feet. PT passed by as I was photographing this abnormality and suggested I send it to the Pennsylvania trail crew. 
I had planned on hiking to the next shelter tomorrow but that would make for an even shorter day than today. Do I really want to pull in for the night at 11:00 AM?  So I’m thinking about 16.6 to the shelter after that. That would make day 4 back to my car a less than two mile day.","RPH Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593986,"Because my plan for this four day hike finishing New York was made with shin splint prevention in mind, I was going to have a very short 7.8 mile day today with a ten mile hike to my car tomorrow morning. But last night I decided to try for the second Shelter, a 16.6 mile day, leaving a mere 1.2 mile walk to my car. I’m glad I decided to push on. I arrived at the first shelter with the cool name of Telephone Pioneers Shelter at 10:15 in the morning, a tad early for setting camp. 
The weather and the trail these past two days have been perfect. Sunny, not too hot, and the trail was never too difficult and passed through some scenic countryside. We hiked alongside the beautiful Nuclear Lake, so named for the plutonium testing facility along its shore, shut down in 1972 after a chemical explosion.  We passed by the Dover Oak, the largest on the trail. We saw the Metro North Appalachian Trail train stop at NY 22 where a most excellent food truck was parked nearby. I enjoyed their fishamajig, seasoned fries, a strawberry shake and a Coke. With a full stomach I hiked on through pastures and the longest sustained climb of this segment. 
I’m happy that my shin splints have not returned and that my heel is holding up well. My new hiking shoes are comfortable and are super grippy on the rocks. After meeting Robbie yesterday I was inspired to listen to some music today. During the later morning I listened to Tchaikovsky’s 6th symphony. The third movement is such a powerful expression of joy that, with the help of exercise induced endorphins, I was literally moved to tears. 
Discerning readers may question why I didn’t just hike the additional 1.2 to my car today. I like camping and chatting around the dinner table. I’m also giving two hikers, Leslie and Brooke, a ride into Kent, CT and it works better for them to arrive there in the morning. Leslie is a sixtysomething section hiker and she’s hiking with Brooke, a twentysomething student of forestry. I’ve been enjoying their company. This has been a most enjoyable section and it has left me with a good feeling about the AT in New York.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595043,"I’m back on the trail for eight days to hike the Massachusetts section to Bennington VT. A friend, Karin, in Salisbury, CT put me up and fed me last night and took me to the trail head this morning. I had planned on starting at the Jug End Rd trail crossing thinking that my brother Nate and I had finished our Connecticut section there years ago. But when we got there this morning I knew we hadn’t hiked that far. So I asked Karin to take me back 2.8 trail miles to the Berkshire School just over the CT-MA border on Rt 41 because I think that’s where Nate and I had stopped and I did not want to cheat. Well that extra 2.8 today turned out to be a serious addition to my planned day. First, I had to climb the 1.5 mile Elbow Trail from the school to the AT. Then, most of those 2.8 miles on the AT were a thousand foot rocky descent. After being at home for a week, today’s total 15.2 was pretty challenging. It took me 9.5 hours.
As is typical on a first day out, my right heel pain was worse than usual and as I lie in my hammock my legs are cramping. Fortunately these maladies subside after two or three days. It’s good that I have a short day tomorrow as I pushed a little to hard today. 
Definitely some pretty trail today, walking through many pine and spruce forests. I love the dark cozy feel and the fresh smell. And there’s no better hiking surface than a bed of pine needles. And speaking of needles, the shelter shows evidence of porcupines munching on the edge of the shelter floor where sweaty hikers have sat. They love the salt and I saw quite a few of their quills on the ground in front of the shelter. 
It’s mostly flip-flippers tonight and one section hiker. They made for good dinner time conversation.Today’s highlight was running into MizMan who was hiking southbound. It happened just after lunch. We sat and snacked and caught each other up on our hikes and what’s up with other hikers we know. He informed me that Hawk, like me, had just decided to take two years to complete the trail. I had hiked a while with MizMan and Hawk back  in the early days of my hike. MizMan holds a secure place on my short list of favorite people I’ve met on my hike.","Elbow Trail Junction

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595161,"In yesterday’s post I mentioned the evidence of porcupine activity near the shelter. I was tucked away in my hammock in lights out mode on my way to sleep when I heard a strange buzzing sound, a sound unlike any I’d heard. I wanted to believe it was a newcomer setting up his tent and the buzzing was the tent’s zipper. But then I thought maybe it’s the porcupine. Then I heard “oh shit” from the tent near me and he confirmed my suspicion. He also said they’re known to eat shoes. We’ll sure, and packs too. They love the salt we filthy hikers impart to our gear. I bravely left my hammock, grabbed my shoes and socks and stowed them between my hammock and underquilt and hung my pack on a tree. After a while the buzzing stopped and the critter began gnawing at the shelter floor. That went on for well over an hour.
In the morning I shared the breakfast table with a nice woman from Atlanta.  Call her Two Words as I can’t remember her trail name but know it was two words. She had her own problems with noise last night and was not a happy camper. There were two hikers near her who were talking till 4:00 in the morning. Though they were not near me, I heard them during one of my nocturnal potty breaks. “Hiker midnight” is generally considered to be 9:00 and all hikers should respect that. 
It was overcast all day and surprisingly cool. There were a few light sprinkles. After I had stopped for an early lunch I was happy to get moving again as I had become rather chilled. The food really rejuvenated me and I was able to cruise along at a respectable clip for most of the rest of the hike. As predicted my heel pain was much better today, though I developed an annoying trouble spot right at the top center of my foot, as though my shoe had a pressure point. I hope it doesn’t come back tomorrow. 
I’m at a campsite tonight rather than a shelter. Of course that means there’s no place to hide from the rain other than under my tarp. Fortunately I’d set up my hammock and tarp and had fetched water before the rain started. I hope it doesn’t rain all afternoon and with no cell service here I can’t look at the forecast. Arriving at camp at 1:00 is nice, but today may mean a whole lotta hanging in my hammock. 
They call this place the Shaker Campsite because it’s on the site of a former Shaker community. There’s one side of a stone building still here though not a whole lotta shakin’ going on.
Tomorrow calls for an 11.2 mile hike to US 20 where Peter, an office friend will be taking me to his home for the night. I’m looking forward to spending time with him and his wife Meredith along with a shower, laundry and resupply. It’s been nice hiking with only three days worth of food. A couple of days later I’ll be atop Mt Greylock where I’ll stay at Bascom Lodge.  Then two more days to Bennington, VT and a shuttle ride back to my car in Salisbury, CT.","Tom Leonard Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595237,"This was one of my favorite days on the trail. I got off to my usual early start, looking forward to staying with friends Peter and Meredith in Stockbridge. Then early in the day at the first road crossing I ran into Jimmy who was doling out trail magic from his truck.  He recorded a short video interview with me as I enjoyed cold sodas and Twinkies. After the interview he mentioned the AMC hut at Sages Ravine and so I told him my AMC story. He loved the story and asked if I’d repeat it on video. You can watch it on YouTube. 
Jimmy started talking about how he’s been helping a hiker named Ringo, who I’d hiked with down south. A minute later up walks Ringo. After a hug and more food and drink we hiked off together. But not before Jimmy offered to take my pack to Rt 20 so I could slack pack the rest of my day’s hike. What a treat it was to hike with Ringo the whole way and with almost no weight on my back.  We practically flew up Baldy Mountain, chatting the whole way like two school girls. It was amazing: virtually every hiker he or I brought up was known to both of us and we could catch each other up on the latest intel on them. We were hiking so fast that I arrived at Rt 20 an hour and a half earlier that I’d planned. I had alerted Peter of my early arrival and he showed up minutes after me.  Meanwhile Jimmy was stationed at a second road crossing along with his wife Sherry and a third trail angel named My Friend who had two dozen donuts on offer. Turns out My Friend lives in New Milford, NJ, a bordering town to mine. It’s absolutely remarkable how many small world examples the trail provides. 
Peter took me to his cottage (Meredith prefers “bungalow”) where I took a much needed shower and threw my filthy soaking wet clothes into the wash. After that they took me on a tour of the charming towns nearby and to Pittsfield where they shopped for groceries and I resupplied. Back home to a marvelous dinner of steak, tomatoes and mozzarella, corn on the cob and grilled vegetables. Fresh strawberries, ice cream and whipped cream for dessert. 
I heard from Peewee this evening and it turns out she’s at the shelter I’d have stayed at tonight had I not been staying at Peter’s. I hope to see her tomorrow.

You may recall a couple of weeks back when my friend Christine dropped me off at the Dennytown Rd crossing to complete my New York section. We had just said goodbye when Durwood and PT showed up. What are the odds that they’d be at that road crossing just as I was being dropped off?  Fast forward to today when my friend Peter dropped me off at Rt 20 this morning. Who should cross the road just as I was donning my pack but Peewee! That’s quite a coincidence especially considering that it happened twice.
Peewee and I chatted briefly as we began hiking but soon enough she was off at Peewee speed while I, no longer slackpacking, hiked my usual slow pace. In just a little while Ringo came along, still slackpacking. After a minute or so I waved him on. I saw them later leaving October Mountain Shelter where they had both lunched. I was happy to see them together as they had not yet met. With thousands of followers, Peewee is this year’s premiere AT video bloggers on YouTube. You can catch her videos under her real name, Amanda Bess.
Today’s hike was easy enough though 16 miles is still a long hike for me. It was raining lightly in the morning but soon enough I saw a sunbeam lighting up a white birch and I shouted “Sun!”.  The rest of the day was sunny and blessedly cool. I think I want to try for a 17 mile hike to the next shelter tomorrow, but not only is that two long days back to back, but the last few miles take me most of the way up Mt Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. I may decide to stop short and camp in Cheshire just before the climb. There’s a church there that lets hikers camp on their lawn. If I decide to do that I may find no trees suitable for hanging my hammock. Fortunately the AT passed right through town so I wouldn’t have to go far out of my way to check it out. If I can make it to the shelter I’d have a very short hike to Bascom Lodge atop Greylock the next day. That would be super nice.","Peter and Meredith’s bungalow

Not only did I make the 16.9 miles, including hiking most of the way up Mt Greylock, but I did so with no pain. I feel like I’m back to being a strong hiker again. It didn’t hurt that today’s weather was beautiful and ideal for hiking. 
The trail passed through two towns today, Dalton and Cheshire. Both were fairly long street walks. In Dalton I ran into Peewee again and stopped at a Cumberland Farms where I grabbed a breakfast sandwich and some OJ. I also picked up an Italian sub and chips to carry for lunch. When I passed through Cheshire I stopped at the Dollar General for water and root beer. At both stops I met other hikers, some of whom are here at the shelter tonight. 
I had an interesting encounter with a bird today. I saw a smallish bird, I think a female blue jay, moving about on the ground, hopping and flapping as though it were injured. It seemed only to be able to jump and fly short distances. I stood still watching it as it began moving closer to me in short hops from branch to branch. I began speaking to it and the bird moved closer yet. When I moved a bit closer it didn’t flinch. At less than three feet away, I don’t think I’ve ever been so close to a bird in the wild. Maybe I’m becoming a woodland creature myself.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595646,"Change of plan. What a pleasant surprise it was this morning as I was making coffee that Robby appeared from the shelter. You may recall during the last camp of my New York hike I met Robby, another classical musician. He’s taken the trail name of Fancypants. He, Topsy, a delightful and bright young woman, and I had lively breakfast conversation and hiked out together at around 7:15. I was in no hurry as I was planning a very short day (a nero) to the summit of Mt Greylock where I was to spend a relaxing day and stay the night there at Bascom Lodge. We arrived there pretty early so they were still serving breakfast. Topsy and I had bacon, egg and cheese on a chibatta roll, served with home fries while Fancypants had a stack of pancakes with real maple syrup. The two of them were hiking on to Williamstown. For four reasons I decided to hike on with them. For one we all hiked together quickly but comfortably and enjoyed non-stop conversation. I don’t often get this opportunity. Secondly, the forecast was for heavy rain starting this afternoon and tomorrow. If I could get to Bennington, Vermont tomorrow rather than Friday I’d only have one wet and miserable camp experience rather than two. Thirdly, I’d be home a day earlier and could enjoy a full weekend with Joan. Fourthly, check-in wasn't till 3:00 and I wasn't thrilled about hanging around in my sweaty clothes for hours.
I think it’s pretty cool the way the trail brings people together. Here we were, three people separated by two decades each, 20s, 40s and 60s, sharing thoughts and ideas. 
A nickname for Vermont is Vermud.  It certainly lived up to its reputation today. Three or four miles after saying goodbye to Topsy and Fancypants in Williamstown I crossed the MA-VT border. Wouldn’t you know that’s when the rain started. And it rained hard all night. 
Just before the border I came to a long steep rocky ascent and I kicked myself for not talking the blue blazed “foul weather route” around it. I must have spent a half hour picking my way through those blasted rocks, stopping often to spy the next white blaze in an otherwise undifferentiated field of tumbled rocks. Fortunately it hadn’t yet started to rain. 
Not arriving at my target shelter till 7:15, I had the miserable experience of setting up camp in the pouring rain. It was a warm rain and I’d already given up trying to keep myself dry. First the ridge line, then the tarp. Set the guy lines for the tarp.  Then secure the hammock straps to the two trees and hang the hammock, trying not to let it drag in the wet leaf litter.  Foregoing the civilities of oral hygiene, I brought my food bag into the hammock with me and ate a few snacks and cookies.  True confessions:  I didn’t bother with the bear box which was a bit of a hike away and dropped my food bag beneath the hammock.  What bear would be out in this weather?  Don’t answer that.  Too tired to write my journal or read my book, I dropped off to sleep.  This entry was written on Thursday.  Stay tuned for Thursday’s entry.  It’ll be a whopper.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Now here’s when the day started to turn around.  Once I concluded that I couldn’t hike my planned 11.5 to Bennington, VT, I looked at my AWOL Guide and saw there was a County Road just 0.3 miles north of the shelter.  There was no cell service, so I devised a plan whereby I’d wait there till someone drove by, stop them, and ask them to call my shuttle driver when they got service and ask him to pick me up at that road crossing rather than in Bennington.  But when I saw the road my heart sank.  It was a small dirt road and I couldn’t imagine anyone choosing to drive on it in this weather.  Just then a dump truck with two road maintenance guys from Stamford, VT came rolling by.  I stopped them and explained my situation and was delighted when they offered to drive me down the mountain into Stamford where I could make the call myself.  Sitting in the bed of their truck, it was a surprisingly long drive into the little town and downhill the whole way.  They dropped me off at a gas station/market from where I called Vic, my shuttle driver.  Turns out Vic lives only four miles from Stamford.  He arrived and asked if I’d like to take a shower at his house.  When I told him I had no clean clothes to change into he offered to fix me up with some old clothes of his.  What a guy!  So off we went to his house for a shower and clean, dry clothes.  His wife gave me a plastic bag for my own horribly befouled clothing.  The drive to Salisbury, CT where my car was parked was rather nice, passing through quaint old New England towns.
So my Massachusetts hike was foreshortened by 11.2 miles, but I had made it to Vermont.  I don’t ever want a repeat of this muddy, wet and sick day.","Seth Warner Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596105,"The next morning after I got home on Thursday I called my doctor and got an appointment for early that afternoon.  I was still sick, but the bouts in the bathroom were less frequent and under control.  My gut was still sounding like plumbing in need of repair.  The doctor explained how she could not prescribe medication without knowing the source of the problem.  Was it giardiasis?  Was it e-coli?  Every bug needs a different weapon.  So she sent me away with three sets of “sample” collection kits which I have since delivered to the lab for analysis.  But now it’s Monday and I’m pretty much recovered and doubt I’ll need any medication.
One of the first things I did when I got home was to call Second Chance, the hiker that was to be my partner for the July New Hampshire hike to inform her that my doctor had nixed my hiking for any time this week.  I feel bad for letting her down.  When I spoke with her again today she told me she was planning to go ahead and hike New Hampshire without me and that she was already up north in Warwick, NY.  I wish her a good and safe hike and I’ll be checking in with her. 
So what about me?  I’m not able to complete New Hampshire before a family commitment later this month. I’m beginning to form a plan that has me filling in the gaps remaining down south. That will include the Smokies which I look forward to hiking with Second Chance. By the end of this year I’d like to have hiked everything from Springer to Boiling Springs, PA along with NJ, NY, CT and MA which I’ve already completed. That would leave PA, VT, NH and ME for next year and maybe beyond. 
It’s been a learning experience. Once I gave up on completing a thru hike this year due to the overuse injuries I was experiencing and set my sites on a more modest goal of completing the entire AT by next year, my attitude, motivation, and level of commitment changed. For many years I’d been enthusiastic about a thru hike once I retired. I believed that I had the right mental attitude that would allow me to finish short of a serious injury or illness. But then after nearly three months on the trail chasing that goal through some very challenging winter weather conditions, two bouts of shin splints were enough to derail my goal. I know other hikers would have jumped back on the trail after a few days of rest and gone on to summit Katahdin.
Why was I willing to give up on the thru hike so easily?  One thing I’ve learned is that even after growing my “trail legs”, I remained a relatively slow hiker.  And when it comes to steep rocky ascents and descents, my wobbly balance and aversion to risk of fall and injury slowed me to a crawl. I learned that while 20 mile days are within my grasp, they take a real toll on my feet and can’t be sustained on any kind of regular basis.  And the long days get me into camp much later than I prefer.  For me, camp is an opportunity to relax, socialize, have a leisurely dinner, and climb into my hammock early enough to write my journal, call Joan, read my book, and still get enough sleep to wake at 5:00 to be hiking by 6:30.  All this and taking time off to recover my shins was adding pressure to my schedule.  I was also missing home life, my wife and friends, enjoying the lake house in the Catskills more than I’d expected. 
Enough.  I’ll get a plan going for the rest of the hiking season and share it here.",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Mon",0
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596436,"I'm up visiting family in Maine and yesterday a carload of us took a day trip up to Baxter State Park, home of Mt Katahdin, the terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  I had never been to Baxter and it was pretty awesome to see that iconic mountain first hand.  We stopped for lunch at Abol Stream Campsite where I chatted up a NOBO thru hiker.  He must have been a very fast hiker and must have hiked long miles most days as he had started at Springer on February 26 and was planning to summit the next day.  I wish I had asked for his trail name.  Something I've often heard from AT hikers when they learn I've decided to be a section hiker are words of support and encouragement.  They point out the benefits of taking more time to hike the trail and leave me feeling good about my choice.
Today, being Friday, I got my email from The Trek with their weekly posting of blogs.  One article caught my eye.  ""Section Hikers are Backpacking's Unsung Heroes"".  Here's a link:
https://thetrek.co/section-hik...

Now don't get me wrong.  I'm still in awe of anyone who can pull off a successful thru hike.  It isn't easy by any stretch.  I'm writing to say that anyone who can complete the AT in sections over multiple years is also worthy of accolades and awe.
And while we're on the subject, here's a term for section hikers I recently heard on the trail.  ""BASHers""  A Basher is a Bad-Ass Section Hiker.  When I heard this I had to call my grandson Bash and tell him about it.  I'm already Farfar because that's what Bash calls me and now, in a way, we're both Bash.  He thought that was pretty cool.
I'll be continuing my section hike on July 17 at Boiling Springs, PA, northbound, to knock off as much as I can in nine days.  There's a hard end to this hike due to a family event I want to attend in New Hampshire on the 27th.",,View Entry,"Jul 06, Fri",0
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597442,"It feels good to be hiking again after 18 days off. Because I haven’t had much exercise lately I’ve planned some low mileage days. I drove to Carlisle, PA in south central Pennsylvania yesterday and had a shuttle driver take me to Boiling Springs further south this morning. That’s where I ended my 15 day shakedown hike last year. I had just 8 miles to get back to Carlisle which I did in less than 3 hours. That’s 2.75 mph, my fastest pace to date. Honestly though, it was probably the easiest 8 miles of my AT experience:  flat, no rocks, no roots, good weather, and knowing I’d be back to my hotel room today, I carried a day pack. Much of the trail was in a wooded corridor alongside corn fields. The thunderstorm forecast for today didn’t arrive until around noon, an hour after I was safely back at the hotel.  It arrived in full force while at lunch. My drive back from lunch took me through flooded streets. There were a couple of moments when my battery light came on and the a/c stopped. It was a nail biter. I tried unsuccessfully to find a way around the flooded area. Good to know my car is amphibious.
The Super 8 here is cheap at $45 per night. The building is shabby, the hall carpeting is dank and issues forth an unpleasant smell, the free breakfast is only slightly underpriced, but the room itself is well air conditioned and the TV has HBO. I watched a new documentary on Robin Williams. 
I got a really nice message from Four Leaf last night. She’s one of the two young women who knighted me Farfar atop Big Bald way back in March. She’s invited MizMan, Hawk and me to her wedding in North Carolina. I am truly touched and honored.
Mike, my shuttle driver, has been driving hikers since 1989. Apparently until 1993 the AT was a 16 mile road walk through this area. During the 80s and 90s the ATC acquired much of the land needed to reroute the trail off the roads. While road walks still exist, they are fewer and shorter. Mike will be picking me up in Port Clinton on July 25. That’s what my plan calls for. That shouldn’t be hard to achieve unless the famous rocks of Pennsylvania stop me in my tracks.","Boiling Springs, PA

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597548,"Thinking I should take it slow until I get my hiking groove back, I had planned a short 6.3 to the first shelter. When I got there at 10:00 it was obviously too early to stop. And the trail to that point had been easy peezy. After stopping there a while to snack and pay a visit to the Taj Mahal, a spacious privy of note, I consulted the AWOL Guide and saw that the next shelter was just another 7.3 away. I also noted the guide says after reaching a pipeline at mile 1141.7, “trail very rocky from here north to PA 274”, a distance of 6.2 miles. After years of hearing about the dastardly Pennsylvania rocks, I was a bit nervous. But actually the rocks were not nearly as bad as many I’d come across elsewhere. They slowed me down a bit, but not much. My new Keens protected my feet better than my old trail runners. 
I arrived at Cove Mountain Shelter at around 2:30, hung my hammock and tarp, fetched and purified 4 liters of water all with plenty of time to relax and fix dinner, mushroom and pesto risotto.  So far, at 5:40, I’m the only one here. 
Tomorrow I pass through the town of Duncannon, most known for The Doyle, an old run down hotel with good food and beer. It’s a must-experience hiker destination, though only the brave take a room there. A shared bathroom, old cots in tiny rooms, no a/c, and reports of roaches drive timid hikers like me to stay elsewhere. Though the overnight options are very limited in Duncannon. There’s a church that lets you camp on their lawn and a campsite right next to an active rail line. No thanks.  I’m only 4 miles away so The Doyle will be closed. There are shelters 8.3 and 15 miles north of me. I’ll see how it goes. 
I spoke with my brother Dan today to wish him a happy birthday. I enjoyed talking with him until I hiked out of cell coverage. Dan is an avid hiker and I look forward to hiking with him after I finish the AT. He’s of the belief that my need to hike the entire AT must be a form of penance for past misdeeds. Could he be right?","Carlisle, PA

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597662,"Another milestone today:  900 miles this year. Today’s hike felt long. Fifteen is a lot of miles for me, especially with all the rocks I encountered today, including 2 miles of bolder scramble on a ridge which always slows me way down. As I’ve mentioned before, it’s not so much the miles or the elevation profile as what’s underfoot. I don’t think I’ve hit the infamous rocks of Pennsylvania, but the rocks today did a number on my feet. 
At around 8:00 this morning I entered the town of Duncannon, PA. The famous Doyle hotel was closed so I couldn’t take a peek inside. But I did stop for breakfast at a diner across the street. I resumed hiking at 9:00 and had one of the longest road walks so far. Between walking the length of the town and then crossing the Juniata and Susquehanna rivers, it was an hour of road walking.
The Doyle hotel has a rich history. Originally built in the 1770s, it burned to the ground in 1803 and rebuilt as a brick structure. In 1880 it was purchased by Adolphus Busch of Anheuser-Busch fame. Prohibition killed the hotel in 1920. Today it’s mostly a hiker destination. Nobody else would dare stay there. 
I ran into a hiker on the street just before The Doyle doing his laundry at a laundromat. We recognized each other. I had shared a table with him at the restaurant at the Nantahala Outdoor Center back in May. It was hiking out of the NOC the next morning that I discovered I’d developed shin splints which ended up taking me off the trail. 
I stopped at the first shelter for a snack and to get water. I downed two liters right there and hiked out with two more, my stomach sloshing uncontrollably. Why so much water?  Because there were no other water sources until tonight’s shelter. And tonight’s shelter has an unreliable spring down 300 steps. Knowing this I arrived at the shelter with two full liters. One I had this evening for cooking and drinking. The second I’ll use tomorrow morning for coffee and drinking till I get to the next water source 6 miles away. Call me lazy and reckless, but 300 stone steps does not appeal after a long day of hiking. 
Logistics for the remainder of this section are anything but straightforward. Shelters are either too close or too far. Towns are miles away from the trail and hostels are just about nonexistent. I’m going to have to take each day as it comes. And I’m still waiting for the heinous rocks to begin.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597806,"My plan was for 13.4 to Yellow Springs Campsite but I got there at 2:00, tired, and with only a half liter of water. Seeing no water source there I decided to hoof on another 4.6 to the shelter, making an 18 mile day. Once I committed to it, I got a second wind. I got here by 4:15. 
I find it interesting that my feet are holding up better than ever. No swelling and really just some soreness which one expects backpacking day after day. The footbed was rocky most of the time, but I still think I’ve yet to encounter the kind of rocks “Rocksylvania” is known for. I’ve been consistently outpacing my plan and will continue to take each day as it comes. I met Craig at a road crossing today. He runs the Rock ‘n Sole Hostel in Summit Station, PA.  I’m probably going to call them from the 501 Shelter 17.5 miles up the trail tomorrow. I desperately need to clean up and do laundry. 
I was asked by a reader about gear changes I may have made during the heat of the summer. Specially about my sleep system and how much water I carry. I have swapped out my 20 degree down quilt for a “Rumpl”, a light weight down blanket. I’m still using the same down underquilt. As for water, no change. I continue to carry two liters when leaving a water source.
And on the topic of gear, here’s a treatise: “Farfar’s evolving relationship with his trekking poles”. I’ve been using the same set of Leki poles for years. They’re lightweight and sturdy. I’ve always used them with the wrist straps around my wrist. I guess I figured that’s what they’re for. Then, after my fall going down Dragon’s Tooth earlier this year, I learned that my fall was in part due to my inability to toss away my poles as they were strapped to my wrist. I literately tripped over my poles. From that point on I was careful to remove the wrist straps when going down anything at all rocky and steep. Gradually I began using the straps less and less and discovered that my hands weren’t getting numb like they had been. Soon enough I stopped using the wrist straps altogether. And now on this trip through Pennsylvania another change has happened. My first day, Tuesday, was a very flat and smooth walk so I simply held my poles in each hand, balanced at the fulcrum point. I found that I enjoyed walking more when my arms were free to swing back and forth like normal people do when they walk. Since then I’ve been carrying my poles like that at least half the time, probably more. I think maybe I hike faster that way and I’d like to think it will improve my balance over time. So when do I actually use them?  On uphills and particularly rocky areas. The End.","Peters Mountain Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597841,"The forecast, last time I checked, called for a chance of rain over the next few days starting today. I hopped out of my hammock this morning at 4:00 when I heard tiny pitter-patters on my tarp to pull my hiking clothes off the clothesline (bear bag line) and stow them safely under my hammock. Of course the rain stopped immediately. But just after noon the rain began and soon became heavy and nonstop. It was too warm to wear my raincoat so I put the rain cover on my pack and hiked on. Soon I was soaked through. I don’t mind hiking in the rain so long as it’s warm and it stops before I need to make camp. 
Three things slowed me down in the morning. The first was a beaver dam which flooded the trail for about 200 feet. There was no way around, so I got to walk in water and mud. The second was a dumb mistake. I crossed a stream by carefully moving from one slippery rock to the next wondering why the trail maintainers hadn’t done a better job placing sturdy rocks for the crossing. I managed to get to the other side, climbed up the embankment and... no trail. No white blazes. I pulled out my phone and checked the GPS app and sure enough I’d left the trail. So back across the stream I went. The trail had turned a hundred feet back. I wish I’d looked for a blaze on the other side of the stream before I forded it. The third was another stream crossing. This one was real and had two logs spanning its banks. The longer of the two was a big tree, one I could have walked across with some level of confidence. However the first log, about five feet in length, was much smaller. About the circumference of a soccer ball and bare of bark, looking slippery. Were I to slip I’d fall about four feet and land on some big rocks in the water. Another option would be to slip and get rewarded with a nutter worthy of a Jackass episode. I had zero confidence I could make it. So off with my hiking shoes, gaiters, two pairs of socks and my calf compression sleeves and on with my camp shoes for an easy walk through the water. Then back on with the hiking shoes. 
Just after that I met a nice man who paints small stones for thru-hikers. He offered me one and it’s quite nice. I failed to admit to having converted to being a section hiker. That’s probably why the rain was so heavy this afternoon. I’ve added pictures of the stone. 
I thought I’d stay at the first shelter at 13.4 miles. But when I got there and fetched water, the rain was coming down so hard that I couldn’t bear the thought of setting up camp. So I checked the guide and saw the PA 645 crossing 2.1 miles away. I decided I’d get there and call the Rock ‘n Sole hostel and ask to be picked up. When I called I learned that they had no vacancies but they’d be happy to drive me to a local hotel. Bless their hearts. 
On the way to the road crossing I met Bloodhound who turns out to be the guy I’d heard about who started his thru hike as a family affair. Mom and dad and their four children. I think he said his youngest was 6. Since starting on March 1, all but he have dropped out. But they shadow his hike and get together with him every four days. Bloodhound told me that the forecast for the next four days was rain. That’s since been confirmed here at the hotel. Having no desire to slog on through another four days of rain, I’m calling quits on this section and Mike, my shuttle driver, is taking me back to Carlisle and my car tomorrow morning.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599435,"Today was the first day of no rain for many days.  That left the trail wet and really muddy. After a while I just stomped thru it and got my shoes super muddy and wet. There was often no way around it.
I think I’ve finally begun to experience the famed rocks of Pennsylvania. It’s not that they’re so horrible, it’s that they go on and on and on till the bottoms of my feet  scream in pain. The rocks made it feel like a long day though I hiked from 8:00 to 4:00. 
I’m out for just three days. Sunday through Tuesday. And I’m spending the two overnights at the Rock ‘n Sole Hostel. I drove down this morning and will drive home Tuesday night. So that means no camping which means no shelter or sleeping gear to carry. That also means I get to carry my day pack instead of my back pack. And because my $40 per night includes dinner and breakfast, I only need to carry lunch. Easy Street on the AT.
Allow me to illustrate what a creature of habit I am. Here is my plan for these three days. Laid out from south to north:
A - PA 645
B - Rock ‘n Sole Hostel 
C - Port Clinton parking lot
D - Road crossing near Eckville Shelter
Sunday-drive to Port Clinton, park car and hike southbound to hostel, C to B.
Monday-shuttle to PA 645, hike northbound to hostel, A to B.
Tuesday-shuttle to Eckville Shelter, hike southbound to Port Clinton, drive home, D to C.
Really pretty simple, and I’d gone over this numerous times in my head. So what did I do after I parked my car this morning?  I hiked northbound instead of southbound. I guess after four months of always making sure I was going north, I just did what I do. Fortunately I came to my senses after ten minutes, and after calling myself unsavory names, I turned around and headed back to the parking lot and started over.
The Rock ‘n Sole Hostel is top shelf. Craig and Jody built a bunk room for six with heat and a/c and a wide garage door opened to a covered picnic table. They serve dinner and breakfast, included in the $40 fee with a nice outdoor shower and laundry service for $3.00.  I’m glad I’ll be back tomorrow. 
Why just three days of hiking?  Now that I’m a BASH (bad-ass section hiker), I can take time off when the spirit moves me. Such as spending Wednesday thru Saturday up at the lake house with dear friends. Thru hikers, this is your queue to weep with envy.","Port Clinton, PA

I had estimated finishing today’s hike at 2:00 and that’s exactly when I pulled into the hiker parking lot at PA 183. Craig was there in 5 minutes to whisk me back to the hostel. Despite my early arrival there were already four other hikers here and one more on the way. A full house. Last night Jody served a big pulled pork sandwich with homemade bbq sauce, broccoli and French fries. Ice cream and fresh baked cookies for dessert. This morning was good coffee, orange juice, cut up fresh fruit, and a scrambled egg, bacon and cheese bagel sandwich. Needless to say I’m happy to be back. 
Today’s hike was rocky in parts and still quite muddy. I gather this area of Pennsylvania often has flooded trail. As a result there are many spots where hikers have tramped down alternative paths around the wet areas. My feet held up better today. Let’s see how they do on tomorrow’s 15 miler south into Port Clinton.
It sure is nice putting on clean dry clothes in the morning.  Especially in the heat and humidity when I arrive completely soaked with sweat. “Glamping along the Appalachian Trail” is a book worth writing.
It turns out I’ve yet to experienced the bad rocks. According to Craig, they start  at PA 309, 11 miles north of where I’ll be leaving Pennsylvania tomorrow. Always nice to have something to look forward to.","PA 645, mile 1192.8

Something that I’ve come to appreciate is how good my feet feel after a good night’s sleep.  No matter how banged up they might get by the end of the day, I always start out the next morning feeling great, like I have no issues at all with my feet.  And they feel good for the better part of the day.  I hope that continues to be the case when I hit PA 309 where the famous Pennsylvania rocks begin in earnest.  I’m looking forward to knocking PA off my to-do list.

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600610,"My plan called for a 10 mile day to the next shelter. But because of my early 6:30 start, I got there at 12:20, way too early to call it a day. The guide showed plenty of tent sites and campsites coming up and I half thought I might make it to the next shelter, my planned stop for tomorrow. As you can see, I’d made an easy plan. Maybe I want to feel like Superhiker by blasting past my miles for the day. But as you’ve heard me say before, I’m pretty apprehensive about the Pennsylvania rocks. It was 4:15 when I got to this lovely campsite, complete with a view of Lehigh valley, so I pulled in for the night. No water source, but I arrived with a little over a liter. 
Breakfast this morning was coffee and a big bowl of cereal. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. A welcome break from Pop Tarts.  This may well become my go-to breakfast. I’ll just change up the cereal now and then. Of course this is with powdered milk.
Ok, so today was without a doubt the day I hit the famous rocks of Pennsylvania. They actually didn’t start at the PA 309 road crossing as I’d been told. Rather they started after the power lines 1.8 miles further north. Knife Edge was a particularly difficult ridge walk, carefully and very slowly making my way over piles of boulders. There were quite a few sections like this. Coming down from Bake Oven Knob was equally bad. I’m probably over cautious, but the thought of falling into these big boulders is downright frightening. Other sections were rocky in a different way. Lots of smaller rocks imbedded in the trail with sharp points to avoid. I do better on these sections because I don’t have such a fear of falling. 
I’m looking forward to tomorrow. I’ll be met by John, an old office mate who lives in Kunkletown. It’s a shower, laundry, a good dinner and a bed for me. And catching up with a good Friend.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600689,"This morning’s hike started out with a big milestone. After 0.9 miles I reached 1000 miles on the Appalachian Trail this year. That definitely put a spring in my step. 
I enjoyed my breakfast time with Fleischman, a flip-flop thru hiker with whom I shared the small campsite. We both wake early and shoot for 6:30 starts to our hikes. 
Today I had to decide whether to stay on the official AT and make the climb up out of Lehigh Gap or to take the blue blazed trail around it. I’d often heard about how difficult and even dangerous the trail is there, a very steep and long rock climb. With the threat of rain in the forecast, I decided to take the coward’s approach. The blue blazed “Lehigh Winter Trail” is both the side trail into the town of Palmerton and the safer “bad weather” route up out of the gap. It’s probably a good thing I went that way because as soon as the trail split off to the right for the climb, it started raining. I can only imagine what those rocks would have been like slippery with rain. The route I chose was longer in length, but was mostly gravel and pitched reasonably. I’ll bet it was quicker too, at least for me. 
After reaching the summit of Blue Mountain and reconnecting with the AT, the trail was mostly smooth and flat, a pleasant walk looking down at the socked-in Lehigh Valley below to the west. But all good things must come to an end and the last few miles were Pennsylvania-rocky. 
My plan had been to stay the night at my friend’s place in Kunkletown, but because I arrived a day early, he was not available. By the time I reached the road crossing where I was to meet him, the rain had stopped, I was soaked in sweat, and the humidity was off the charts. I no longer attracted mosquitoes but became a magnet for flies. How appealing is that?  Now the forecast was for heavy rain this evening. I looked for lodging options in the area and saw Filbert B&B. I made a call and was picked up by Kathy, the proprietor. It’s an old Victorian farm house converted to a B&B in 2002. Nice to have a shower and clean clothes. John will meet me at the end of tomorrow’s hike. 
I’ll be done with Pennsylvania by Monday or Tuesday.","Campsite at mile 1255.6

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600725,"Kathy drove me back to Blue Mountain Rd after serving me a tasty B&B style breakfast and I continued north at 7:50. The initial rocky climb definitely woke me up, but after that it was mostly smooth sailing. I called my brother Dan who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and we talked about my upcoming visit there and all the marvelous hikes he wants to take me on, including a redwood forest hike in Oakland. I’m looking forward to hiking in anything other than the eastern woods, as much as they’re dear to my heart. I spent most of the 7.3 miles hiking at a good clip getting me to my destination at Smith Gap Rd at 11:30. 
On my way I thought about how I wanted to finish my Pennsylvania section. Should I hike on to Wind Gap, an additional 8.1 miles, or should I make it an early day. Could I boldly ask John and Elizabeth to put me up for two nights?  If so, I could have two easy days and a final long day on Monday from Wind Gap to my car at Delaware Water Gap. Given the forecast for continued rain until Monday, I opted for the two short days today and tomorrow. Turns out John is happy to accommodate me and shuttle me to and from the trail both days. 
I’m very much enjoying catching up with John and his wife. He and I worked together at the bank. John retired nine months before me and we both feel the same about retirement. We love it and don’t miss work at all.  I highly recommend retirement as a way of life. 
So just two more days to finish Pennsylvania. My feet are holding up just fine and I’ve even stopped taking my prescription anti-inflammatory pills. Life is good.","Filbert B&B

I was moving fast over rocky terrain and made it to Wind Gap by 11:30.  I sent John a pin of my location and he and Elizabeth picked me up after church. After a shower and starting laundry, they served me lunch and I took a wee nap in the afternoon. 
We then went to the annual West End County Fair where we heard a sing-off of local church choirs. Their church choir participated. We didn’t stick around for the panel of judges to pick the winner, instead opting for dinner at their church’s pavilion. Kielbasa and krout for me. Definitely a down home scene. 
Tomorrow it’s back to real hiking after three short days of short hikes, showers, clean clothes, good meals and beds. I’ve got 15.1 miles back to my car parked at Delaware Water Gap. Then one more state checked off.  And a short drive home.","The home of John & Elizabeth Dworak

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600991,"My friend got me to Wind Gap and I started hiking at 6:50. A heartfelt thanks to John and Elizabeth for hosting and slackpacking me for two days.  I had 15.3 remaining in Pennsylvania and I wanted to get an early start.  I’m glad I did as it turned out to be another rocky day.  I knew I’d be facing Wolf Rocks and I had pretty much decided I’d take the blue blazed trail around them.  In a state known for its rocks, when there’s a named section that has the word “rocks” in it AND they’ve built a trail to bypass them, I figured they’d be bad, maybe even dangerous.  After around 6 miles I arrived at the junction with the bypass trail and took a few steps up it.  Then I stopped and thought again about what my friend Second Chance had said about Wolf Rocks.  She only found out she’d hiked through them afterwards when someone told her and she hadn’t thought they were all that bad.  Well today I had no “bad weather” excuse so I turned around and proceeded up the AT.  I still didn’t know whether Wolf Rocks were a stretch of particularly bad pointy and sharp rocks imbedded into the trail or a patch of big boulders that I’d need to navigate slowly with caution. It turned out to be the latter.  But these rocks were not nearly as bad as other such portions I’d experienced in Pennsylvania and elsewhere for that matter.  I was glad I’d stayed on the AT.
I met Nick on the way, a young southbounder who had started recently in New Jersey.  He was relocating to Florida and figured he’d hike most of the way there.  Nick was very new to trail life so I emailed him a copy of my list of hostels voted best by last year’s class of thruhikers. 
The closer I got to Delaware Water Gap the more people I ran into.  I saw a large group of young people that I guessed were on a Freshman orientation outing. Lots of day hikers too.  It was a long climb down to the hiker parking lot where my trusty car was patiently waiting for my return.  Another happy reunion when the car unlocked and started without a hitch.
Throughout this six day section finishing Pennsylvania I’ve been noticing a new tightness and slight discomfort in what I’m thinking are my hamstrings and/or lower back. I’d feel it simply walking up the stairs at John’s house. I’ll need to try some stretching.
It’s nice to be home again. Joan and I are visiting friends on Keuka Lake in the Finger Lakes this weekend.  Then I fly to Iowa to visit my mother and the two of us fly to San Francisco to visit my brother Dan. He’s got some nice hikes planned out there.  When I return I’ll be back on the trail hiking the great state of Vermont.  I’m hoping Vic, the shuttle driver who rescued me when I was sick at the start of Vermont, will be able to drive me to the spot where I got off.  Vermont hosts 148 miles of the AT and it should be beautiful in September; less mud, fewer insects, cooler weather, and even some fall colors if I’m lucky.","Wind Gap, PA

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602762,"I’m back on the trail. This time to hike the great state of Vermont. The AT shares its first 100 miles with the Long Trail, our country’s first long distance hiking trail. I ran into some “end to enders”, the traditional term for Long Trail thru hikers, today. After Mount Killington the AT splits off to the northeast while the Long Trail continues north to the Canada border. 
I have the good fortune to be hiking today with my brother Nate who’s joined me for a day and an overnight. Tomorrow he’ll hike south back to the Rt 9 crossing and get a ride back to his car in Williamstown, MA.  Nate lives in Portland, ME with his family. He’s always been active and keeps himself in good shape. And he’s ten years my junior. I must remind myself of this as he’s proven himself to be a significantly faster hiker than I. And he’s hiking on two artificial knees. Hiking and camping is a great way to spend time together and I’ve very much enjoyed his company. 
Prior to my hike of Pennsylvania, I hiked Massachusetts. It was at the end of that hike, just into Vermont, that I got sick and had to end my hike a day short. Vic, the same shuttle driver who rescued me that morning and provided me with a shower and a set of clean clothes, drove Nate and me to the very spot where I had gotten off on that rainy miserable day. Vic will be meeting me in Hanover, NH to drive me back to my car which he has graciously allowed me to keep at his home. 
It’s good to be back. The hiking was pretty slow today. Lots of rocks, roots and mud. And the climbs down to and up from the Rt 9 crossing we’re long and steep. It was blessedly cool today which helped a lot. I’m lying in my hammock grateful that I have my winter weight quilt. It’s already cold at night up here in the mountains of Vermont.","County Rd, just into VT

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602763,"Two things taking me somewhat by surprise. So far Vermont has been rockier than I had expected and it’s been colder than anticipated. These first two 12.8 mile days have been pretty slow going. Pretty much everywhere I’ve hiked, most days have offered at least some stretches where you can open up and cruise along. Relatively flat and free of rocks and roots. So far not in Vermont. And cold?  It was 42 degrees this morning. I hadn’t packed gloves. It’s been so hot back home. My brother loaned me his alpaca gloves to use for the trip. Thanks, Nate. 
Nate and I said goodbye this morning after breakfast. He headed back down to the Rt 9 crossing while I continued my northbound hike. I think I could get used to hiking with a partner.  It felt lonely today. The hikers at Congdon Shelter where I stopped for lunch weren’t much interested in conversation.  I’ve also been struck by how quiet the woods have been. No bird songs; not even any crickets at night. 
I’m alone tonight. Kid Gore Shelter offered no good hammock hanging spots so I walked ahead to where the guide said there was a camping area with a stream. The stream offers good water, but I can’t see how they can call this a camping area. It’s way too rocky to pitch a tent and I’ve hung my hammock over numerous microwave oven-sized rocks. It’s been a challenge not tripping over them, especially with hiker hobble legs. 
Tomorrow it’s up and over Stratton Mountain on a 15 mile day. I’ll need to work on my attitude. This is supposed to be fun.","Melville Neuheim Shelter 
",Kid Gore Shelter ,"Sep 09, Sun",12.80
Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602764,"The plan called for 15 miles up and over Stratton Mountain, a 1700 ft ascent and descent. The forecast calling for rain. I got started shortly before 6:30 and enjoyed the hiking. There were short stretches of easy terrain where I was able to cover ground quickly, at least for me. I arrived at the first shelter mid-morning. There was a fire going tended by a gentleman of my vintage who had decided to take a zero there due to the 100% chance of rain which had yet to come. There was good cell coverage there so I called Joan.  She hadn’t heard from me since Saturday due to lack of coverage. Nor have I been able to post any journal entries on this trip. It’s a blackout here tonight as well. 
I certainly didn’t want to stop for the day at that early hour so consulting the guide I saw a campsite just north of Kelly Stand Rd, just before the Stratton ascent. Two other guys showed up at the shelter also planning to get over the mountain. Also considering stopping short. We told ourselves we’d see what happened with the rain. 
I met them again at a stream crossing just before Kelly Stand Rd. It had just started sprinkling and we checked the forecast again. 100% today and a mere 60% tomorrow. That settled it. So the three of us are here at this campsite. Thankfully the rain didn’t start in earnest until after I’d set up my tarp and hammock. 
It’s been a long afternoon lying here. I finished my audiobook, took a nap, read some, came up with potential plans for tomorrow, and cooked dinner using my hammock as a chair. It would be nice if the rain stopped in the morning when it’s time to break camp.","Kid Gore Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602765,"The question of the day:  was I going to try and get back on plan and make it 17.5 miles to the hostel, including the 1700 ft climb over Stratton Mountain?  I had my doubts. Fortunately the Stratton ascent and descent, though long, were gradual. And not bad under foot. And after a short day yesterday and way more sleep than I needed, I was in top form. The rain came down hard today, continuing last night’s soaking, making the trail a sloppy mudway. Here I’d chosen to hike Vermont during the month of September because it’s supposed to be the driest. Oh well. This state has certainly earned its nickname of Vermud. 
The mud slowed me down a lot, jumping from one side of the trail to the other to try and avoid the worst of it. And now that I’m walking through coniferous forest, the trail is often covered in roots. Throw in the plentiful rocks and you’ve got the trifecta for slow hiking. I kept changing my mind about where to end my hike today based on the progress I was making. In the end I decided to go for it and make it to the hostel 17.5 miles. The last two miles seemed to go on forever. It took me 11.5 hours, but I made it. 
I met some nice hikers today. The two men I camped with last night, Phil and Dave, are hiking the entire Long Trail.  It amazes me how pretty much every hiker I come across hikes considerably faster than I. And not just the young’uns. But I actually passed a woman who looked to be in her 40’s. I thanked her for hiking slowly. There’s a young guy from Georgia by the name of Big Chicken who just graduated high school and is thru hiking the AT southbound. Very impressive guy. 
The Green Moulton House Hostel is quite nice. $35 gets you a real bed, free laundry, breakfast, use of the kitchen and of course a badly needed shower. The way they work it is you hitchhike from the road crossing into the town of Manchester Center, get dinner and resupply your trail food. Then you call them and they pick you up in town. Not arriving until nearly 6:00, I was nervous about making their 7:00 cutoff. But it didn’t take long to get a hitch into town and I picked up something for dinner at the grocery store where I resupplied.","Campsite just north of Kelly Stand Rd

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602867,"In my extolling of the hostel I neglected to mention the $1 pints of Ben & Jerry’s. I chose Cherry Garcia. The ride to the trail wasn’t till 8:00 so there was plenty of time to chat around the breakfast table. There were plenty of laughs and the whole experience put me in a good frame of mind for taking on the trail. The forecast looked promising with only a 30% chance of rain today and good weather after that. Clean dry clothes and wet boots, I was ready. With only 10.1 planned for the day, what could go wrong?
The 30% turned into 110% before the first hour was up. On went my pack’s rain cover and I was soon hiking in soaking wet clothes and muddy boots. No rain, no pain, no Maine, the saying goes. First up was the climb up Bromley. As I approached the summit the trail went up one of Bromley’s ski slopes. It was all misty and it was fun to think about how I and my family growing up 50 years ago probably skied this very slope. It was marked “Easiest way down” so it’s very likely. I chatted with a hiker up at the summit who, like me but last year, had to get off the trail at Fontana Dam. He’s finishing up this year as I will be next year. 
I’ve had a lot of opportunity to observe how my mind works while hiking alone without listening to music, books or podcasts. I don’t often ponder meaty topics (well maybe meat). Today, as a typical example, I spotted a white blaze that was painted on a knot in a tree, recessed slightly as a result. Right away I thought, “The blaze is recessed a neat, clean, quarter inch away” to the tune of the old Parliament cigarette jingle. Older readers will recall when it was legal to air cigarette commercials on TV. Then for the next couple of hours that tune was on an endless loop in my brain. So much for solving the problems of the world. 
I rolled into the shelter shortly after 2:00. By then the rain had stopped but the humidity was so close to 100% that I could see the droplets of water in the air. I found a spot to hang my soggy hammock and started to pitch my tarp’s ridge line. The strangest thing happened. I couldn’t get it right. I fiddled with it for some time before giving up. I’ve been doing this for 1100 miles. What’s going on?  I decided to walk away and try again later. Some Cheese-its would surely cure my failing brain. It worked. I went back, took everything down and started from the beginning. I don’t even know what I’d done wrong. 
Dinner was nice. Around the picnic table were Penguin, Solo, Sunshine, Dave, and Phil. All but Solo I’d met before, three of whom were at the hostel last night. 
Two days of hiking in the rain has presented a problem:  chafing. Under my arms and my upper thighs. I’ll be putting on my wet clothes again tomorrow. Not looking forward to that. What I crave now is dry weather.","Green Mountain House Hostel

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602892,"Aside from it raining at 2:15 this morning, the rest of the day went splendidly. When I woke to the alarm at 5:00 the rain had stopped. A note about that alarm. It might be better to wake naturally. But in order to be hiking by 6:30 I need to be up at 5:00. I like being the first one out, breaking the spider webs and hiking at first light. Everyone ends up passing me anyway due to my slow speed and I’ve always been a morning person. Besides I get plenty of sleep going to bed as early as I do. 
Today marks another 100 mile milestone:  1100 miles hiked this year. My tradition of taking a selfie with a finger for every 100 miles presented a challenge as I was born with only ten digits. Because the milestone was to occur just 0.3 miles from the shelter, I asked for a volunteer. Penguin said she’d be along in a few minutes so I went ahead and scoped out a spot to secure my phone. When I crossed the footbridge that marked the spot I stopped to marvel at the sun and blue sky. The first since I started six days ago. Penguin came along and we got it done with ten of my fingers and one of hers. She’s a die-hard Pittsburgh Penguins fan. 
We met up again mid morning at a shelter and traded stories. Turns out her mother was doing the New York choral singing thing around the same time I was. She now sings at a church in Greenwich Connecticut where Anthony Newman is organist. I had a hilarious story to tell her about my interaction with Tony back in the early ‘70s when he performed at my college. It’s a small world out here on the AT. 
Today offered one of those hiking experiences that don’t happen all that often. There was a long stretch of trail that went on for at least an hour with a nice gentle downward slope and relatively few rocks and roots. And not too much mud either. If felt almost like I was flying down the trail. And it was still morning so I had good energy, strength and no aches or pains. By the way, my feet are doing so well now that I’ve stopped taking anti inflammatories. It’s like my plantar fasciitis is gone. Who knew abuse is the best treatment. 
I got to the shelter at 4:00 and hung my hammock away from the shelter. There are three guys there our for a seven day hike, this being day one and therefore “bring along some beers” day. I did enjoy their company and one of them offered half of his baked potato to Penguin and me. 
Sunshine just came by my hammock to say hi. That’s so nice of her. She’s the slow hiker I passed a couple of days ago and has shown up at the past few shelters. It’s the people you meet that make the trail experience what it is. 
One more thing. I passed two rock gardens today in a beautiful hemlock forest. Over the years hikers have added small rocks to dozens of small cairns. They are quite magical to come across. I’ve included a photo or two.","Peru Peak Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602969,"It’s day seven of my Vermont hike, a long day with some steep sections, mostly up. In particular there was a challenging rock climb out of Clarendon Gorge. I can imagine it would have been worse in the other direction picking my way down. I fell twice mid-morning on a downhill with smooth slippery rocks. I hit pretty hard on the second fall and threw one of my poles off the trail and had to remove my pack to go fetch it. The fall also tore one of my water bottle holders off so had to perform a quick field repair. Later, when I stopped at a shelter for lunch, I found some discarded cord to bolster the repair. I hope it holds. 
While stopped for lunch, Penguin showed up. I was almost out of food so I asked her if she had any extra she could spare. She said she did and now I have enough to get me to the hostel tomorrow. 
At the shelter tonight I met Snowy, an interesting gentleman, probably in his 70s, from Hanover, NH. He’s a very active backpacker and six years ago bicycled from San Francisco back to Hanover with his daughter and her friend. Took two months and ten days. He’s no couch potato. 
I met a deer today almost on the trail. She didn’t run away and actually approached closer to me and allowed me to walk closer to her. Definitely a highlight of the day. 
Tomorrow I’ll be hiking up and over Mount Killington. It’s higher than Stratton and Bromley and hosts New England’s largest ski resort. I’ll be glad to be at The Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel for the night. I’ve heard good things about it. It’s donation based and located in the town of Rutland.","Greenwall Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603020,"At 2000 feet, the climb up and over Killington was the biggest yet on my Vermont section. It was beautiful up there with balsam trees in abundance giving off their Christmas tree fragrance. Though I chose not to climb the extra 0.2 up to the peak (I heard it was a rocky climb), I did get a nice clear view from a half mile or so back.  The climb was long but gradual enough for comfort. 
The second half of my hike consisted of mostly downhill, probably the longest sustained downhill since my ill-fated descent into the NOC in North Carolina that resulted in the shin splints that took me off the trail. This time I don’t feel any shin pain. I’m now wearing calf compression sleeves, but I think the real difference is that with my right foot seemingly healed, I’m no longer favoring it which means I’m not pounding on my left leg. 
I arrived at the Rt 4 road crossing at 2:00 and walked east up the hill to the Pico Ski Resort where a free bus took me into the town of Rutland and the Hiker Hostel at Yellow Deli. It’s a popular spot run by members of the Seventh Tribe cult and is donation based. Right in the center of town, there’s a nice brewpub a few doors down where Sugar Pants, a hiker from Australia, and I had good beer, pizza and conversation. 
Yesterday I mentioned an older hiker, Snowy, I met at last night’s shelter. Well early this morning as he was returning from the privy, he mistakenly made a left turn instead of a right turn back to his tent. That brought him to me while I was brushing my teeth. We got to chatting and I learned that his wife Jean is a Juilliard trained pianist who accompanies the Dartmouth Choral Society in Hanover. I told him that my old friend who I’m meeting for dinner in Hanover after this hike conducts a choral group in the area. He asked who, I told him, and it turns out he knows her and Jean is often her accompanist. As I’ve said before, the AT is a small world.

I’d heard great things about the hostel from numerous hikers and write ups but I don’t think I got to experience that greatness because the cult members who normally run the place were observing the ten days leading up to Yom Kipper and were nowhere to be seen. I think the guy on duty was a work for stay person or else a hired hand. He lacked the friendliness and hospitality I’d been looking forward to. Breakfast at 7:30 turned out to be a pot of coffee, cereal and milk. 
Sugar Pants had decided to zero there having concluded that he wouldn’t be able to complete his thru before his flight back to Australia and the expiration of his visa. Sunshine was doing her laundry when I left, determined to complete her end-to-end of the Long Trail. I suggested she consider sticking to the AT through Vermont as I’d heard that the LT gets very difficult up north. 
Just one mile into today’s hike I came to Maine Junction where the Long Trail continues north to Canada and the Appalachian Trail heads east towards New Hampshire. No longer will the first question upon meeting another hiker be, “Are you hiking the Long Trail or the AT?”  
It looks like I may be the only one here at the shelter tonight. I hope I don’t get eaten by a bear. I like having my homemade dehydrated dinners. They connect me to home. 
The trail took me up and over Quimbly Mountain which turned out to be long and steep both up and down. I was glad for a short ten mile day, given my late start. 
Just three more days for this section. Then Vermont is in the bag. 
PS. I ran out of fuel just as my dinner was done cooking. Unless I get off trail to buy more or I’m able to Yogi another hiker’s canister, I’ll be eating cold. Mostly snacks and breakfast food.

That made me even madder at myself for not taking the time to stop at The Lookout, a cabin just 0.2 miles off trail up an incline. The hikers from Boston had stopped there and said the view was terrific. They had passed me earlier and stopped there for lunch. With only ten miles to make today I had no good excuse. 
This morning at breakfast at the shelter these same three hikers gave me their half spent canister of fuel after hearing I’d run out the night before. I had casually remarked that I was quite enjoying my coffee even though cold because I was using Mini Moos, those little containers of half & half rather than the powdered milk I had been using. “Why cold?”, they asked. I told them about running out of fuel after making dinner last night. A classic Yogi maneuver. Sounds manipulative I know, but look at it this way: they were getting off the trail today and didn’t need the fuel. See?  I saved them from carrying the extra weight. A win-win. 
The weather wasn’t as hot today and by afternoon had dried out a bit. I hung my wet clothes up just after hanging my hammock and fetching water and now, early evening, they’re already showing signs of drying. This in sharp contrast to last night when the humidity was so high that this morning, when I shook out my shirt to rid it of any potential bugs, I got splashed in the face with my own sweat.

I jumped out of my hammock and gathered my belongings including my hiking clothes hanging out to “dry”. It was raining pretty hard and I figured because it was from a hurricane it could last a couple of days. I busied myself thinking up an exit strategy. I had two more days and I didn’t want to spend them hiking in the rain and dealing with wet gear. I decided I’d hike six miles to the Stage Rd crossing where there was a hiker friendly deli a mile to the east. I’d call Vic, my shuttle driver, and ask if he could pick me up there a day early. I could easily drive back up here later a finish Vermont with a single overnight. 
At around 5.45 I started taking down camp, scurrying back and forth to the shelter to get things out of the rain, though I managed to get the hammock wet in the process. I didn’t much care given that I’d be going home that day. 
Once I and my gear were in the shelter, one of the ladies from Wisconsin told me she had been able to get a weak signal last night and had checked the forecast. The rain was supposed to stop later in the morning and it was to be sunny for the next couple of days. Back to Plan A. This was good news indeed. I really didn’t want to miss seeing my friend in Hanover on Wednesday and didn’t want to change plans with Vic. Sure enough, after an hour on the trail, off came my rain coat. Soon beautiful blue sky started peeking through. 
12.3 miles may not seem like a lot, but today was another one of those days where the trail always wanted to be going up or down, often steeply. I was beat by 3:45 when I arrived here at Thistle Hill Shelter. I cooked the last of my homemade dinners and polished off my beloved Cheese-its.

I also called Vic, my shuttle driver who began his drive up from Williamstown, MA to pick me up and take me back to his home where he had kindly allowed me to leave my car.
Because I was back to my car by 7:00 PM, I decided to drive home in the evening rather than take a hotel stay in Williamstown.  I arrived home at around 10:30 to a warm welcome from Joan.  It’s good to be back.
So what’s my assessment of Vermont?  I’d say it’s a beautiful state to hike through, particularly the northern half, after leaving the Long Trail.  Lots of pine and hemlock forests with soft pine needle-covered trail.  There were plenty of spectacular views and more ups and downs than expected.  I saw very few hikers once I parted company with the Long Trail as NOBO hikers had long-since passed through as had the SOBOs.  Due to the rain early on and again towards the end, I failed at avoiding the “Vermud” syndrome.  By far the worst mud was in southern Vermont.
That’s it for now.  I hope to make it back down to Virginia to knock off the two sections remaining there:  Daleville to Rockfish Gap-134 miles and the northern Shenandoah-48 miles.","Thistle Hill Shelter
