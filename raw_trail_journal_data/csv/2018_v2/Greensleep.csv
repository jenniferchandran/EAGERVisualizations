Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570216,"Flying to Maine tomorrow. Leaving my home on a ""set it and forget it"" basis so I'll not be fretting about the mundane stuff. Over planned, second guessed, dollars spent---only thing left to do is go for a walk. I'll be posting journal entries when I can and have no idea how long I'll persevere on the trail. My hope is for the entire length, but the best laid plans--and all that. If able to get over myself and keep putting one foot in front of the other, this should work. I'm very aware that, for hikers my age, the usual reason to get off the trail is injury. The plan is to start slowly and cautiously. Were something untoward to happen, well then, I'll be doing my best to adhere to my motto; ""Humor is the gadfly on the corpse of tragedy"". 
    This has been a dream of sorts for over 20 years now; and I no longer have an excuse not to pursue it. Although, as the late Mitch Hedberg said ""I'm tired of chasing my dreams, from now on, I'll find where they're going and hook up with them there."" 
Walking on",,Katahdin,"Jun 28, Wed",0
Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571016,"Well, 
    I am now heading home to Florida. After a very good start in Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park. Climbed Katahdin on July 1---12 hours (watching the 20 somethings whizzing by), but back in camp, fed, in the sack by 2000. Spent Sunday resting, filtering water, getting ready for the next day's hike to Abol Bridge campground. Monday, felt a bit dizzy, but put that down to the strenuous changes I was experiencing. 10 miles to Abol Bridge. But after hiking I felt much worse with severe vertigo. Tried to get down some electrolytes added to my water, but couldn't hold it down. I had tanked up, so to speak, on Saturday after my hike in the very humid weather, with a few liters of water with electrolytes added as a precaution against dehydration and depletion. Evidently not enough. I had to be taken into Bangor, Me. and, initially, spent that afternoon trying to rehydrate in a hotel, however, the vertigo was so bad that I was unable to stand upright without falling and still couldn't hold anything down so ended up in the ER with an IV of dextrose and electrolytes. Spent a night there, hoping to get back to the trail next day. The physician providing my care stated that my diabetes (type 2) along with electrolyte depletion had gotten the best of me and strongly recommended that I not return to the trail until I had my diabetes under control and had lost some weight. With a ""better safe than sorry"" decision, I booked a flight home. 
     Huge disappointment, needless to say; over a year of planning, expenses, and dreams now on hold for a while. I'm not done! I will be back hiking, however, I will probably not be able to do it this year. Got a lot of ""work"" to accomplish on myself before heading back out. Either late this year or early next, the plan is to, now, head north bound instead of south. Getting as far as possible before the next winter. I'll probably have to take part of 2 years instead of one. Meaning my hope of being a ""thru hiker"" will be compromised, but expecting and determined to do the entire length, nevertheless. 
    For those friends and acquaintances hoping to follow me on this journal, I apologize for disappointing you and hope you don't feel ""let down""! By the time I re-begin my trek, I may have to start a new journal to replace this original---don't know. I will let you know. 
     A lesson has been learned.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571426,"Been at home now since this past Thursday. Needless to say, disappointed in the extreme, but am actively attempting to regain my health. My house's roof needed repair anyway, and now will have it. By the time the home is back to hunky dory, hopefully, so will I. (dated myself with that euphemism)     My tentative plan for ""re-engagement"" is to, now, start at the southern terminus and head north. What time of year that turns out to be will determine how far I can expect to hike. Winter may become an issue. I'll have to get some of the resupply boxes, originally sent to my brother, sent back, to use in either colder or warmer weather, initially, than I originally planned. Other than rain;  the temps. and light breezes made Maine a pretty comfortable place while I was there. 70s during the days and 60s at night. Even though it was a short lived experience, I picked up a couple pointers re: the kind of, if any, stove I'll carry; the type of food I'll carry (I originally had 7 to 8 days of food in my bag weighing only 9 lbs., mostly dehydrated and freeze dried---way too boring and lacking flavor); and how to more efficiently deploy my tent. My first attempt at setting up camp was, unfortunately, witnessed by an experienced hiker. Even though I had set up and slept in my Duplex tent more than a half dozen times in the previous year in all kinds of weather, it took me nearly 20 minutes to set up. I have no idea why, just couldn't get it together; it was as if I'd never seen it before. Embarrassing and, I feared, maybe leading to an unfortunate trail name.     Everybody that had expressed support for my adventure has been equally supportive of my decision to temporarily get off trail and getting back on when better able.  I can't express my gratitude for that support enough!      I hope to continue to journal during my ""hiatus"", eventually to be doing so from the AT once again.Eventually walking on, Lynn",,Springer,"Jul 09, Sun",0
Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572604,"I've joined a gym after realizing that a dedicated space/destination and a financial investment for exercise will add motivation. Been working out every day in the AM, starting slowly but adding a bit more difficulty and complexity each day to a developing routine. I believe spending most of my efforts on leg/knee strengthening along with ""core"" exercises will have the most benefit. Cardio is just naturally part of the leg and knee program since I'm spending a lot of time on treadmill, stationary bike, and elliptical machine to accomplish my fitness goals. I've included upper body strengthening exercises, but the focus is core and legs. Losing weight will be one of the expected results, however, I am not planning to worry about it. Hopefully, changes in my eating habits will have beneficial results as well.
     My thoughts are that a Nobo start at Springer Mt. next April might be my best bet, with the possibility of a ""flip flop"" after 2.5 to 3 months. Didn't want to hike with the crowd, but I have to be realistic and accept that I probably won't be ready for Katahdin and Maine again until I've developed my ""hiker legs"". 
     Again, much appreciation for the support provided by those who continue to encourage me.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573331,"After a week working out each day at the gym, I've lost no weight, but have increased my stamina. The weight is an issue of my poor eating habits and I'm working on those. Been able to add degrees of difficulty to the inclined treadmill and stationary cycle. Planning to add a 25 lb. backpack next month. I've also been able to add just a bit of weight and reps. to my routines for upper and lower body strength.     Maintenance of my old wooden house has turned out to be more laborious and time consuming than I thought it would be this year. There appear to be a few problems of which I was unaware prior to my 1st attempt at the trail in June. It's turning into a costly summer. Nevertheless, continuing with my planning and preparation for the next try, which will begin in Georgia this time. By then, my home should truly be in a ""set it and forget it"" state.      I've slowly been making small changes in my equipment and food for the hike. Adding some ounces here and losing some there. All in all, my pack should still weigh about 32 lbs. with water and food for 4 days. We'll see.walk on",,health,"Jul 27, Thu",0
Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577346,"Just an update on my health and hiking goal statuses.
     It's now been around 9 weeks since I started to work out. Been at it religiously 6 days a week, each AM for a couple hours. Continuing to add time, elevation, and speed to my treadmill, elliptical machine, and biking. And adding weight and reps to my strength exercises. I am noticing changes in my body, but still haven't lost significant weight. I have, though, added some muscle weight; my previously shapeless extremities are beginning to take on some ""definition"". My stamina increases a bit weekly. Still fighting my lazy diet.
 This coming week we may experience hurricane Irma here (I live in the Florida panhandle) and I am spending most of my time preparing, as best I can, for loss of services, utilities, water, etc.. My house is well above high tide levels, so no flooding issues; hopefully, my roof will withstand the wind force; it has twice, now, weathering hurricanes Ivan and Dennis that were direct hits with winds over 130 mph. However, as mentioned in an earlier post, the roof needs some extensive repairs anyway and the contracted roofer hasn't been able to get to my job yet due to seemingly continuous rains. Sooo, I'm a bit worried that I might lose part or all of the thing, depending on wind strength. Unfortunately, I have a home powered mostly by photovoltaic panels mounted on the south roofs of my garage and house. Wouldn't normally even be a concern as most of the wind from hurricanes here is from the north, but with an already compromised north roof---well, I'll find out. In previous power outages and loss of municipal water, it' been no problem for me as I also have a solar powered well pump. I may end up as one of the ""masses"" with no power nor water. Fingers crossed!
     I am now fairly sure that I'll be starting on the trail in April of 2018 with a Nobo itinerary. I still have all the gear and desire to do it. Barring losing my home to a hurricane or having a significant health crisis, I'll be out there in a few months.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580208,"Another update for my records or for anyone who is still interested in my progress toward a 2nd attempt at the trail.     Been faithfully working out 5 to 6 days per week, 2 hours a day. Still increasing difficulty levels on the cardio exercises and adding weight to strength exercises. I haven't added a pack on my back yet to my walking, but am expecting to be able to do that by December. I've lost some weight and have a lot more to lose yet. My extremities actually are beginning to develop a little definition. Still have significant house repairs to complete before I can leave again, but should be done with those by the end of December.      Based upon research I've been doing, I believe that a ""flip-flop"" thru hike will be my best bet for success next time, instead of a nobo. Looking into starting at Delaware Water Gap (or thereabouts), heading north to Katahdin, then flipping back to Delaware Water Gap and heading south to Georgia. I think that this will give me more time in which to complete the hike before hard cold weather would set in. Hopefully, I'd have my ""hiker's legs"" by the time I hit the Whites and upon starting in DWG again but heading south after flipping down from Maine, could hike at a brisk rate thru the southern 2 thirds of the trail, beating winter. If I start in April, this plan should work. Anyway, that's where I'm at now.","off the trail

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581430,"I've managed to get a bit more organized for the upcoming reattempt to thru hike. Set a date of April 3 for a start and have made reservations for flights, hotel, and initial outfitting. I'll be headed to Delaware Water Gap for a ""flip flop"" hike. I think that this plan will get me started with less trying terrain than a traditional nobo; I'll be hiking north to Katahdin first, then fly back to DWG for the south bound portion of the journey. This should also get me to the finish in Georgia before winter sets in. The hope is that I'll have my ""hiker legs"" before arriving at Katahdin and that tackling the rocks of Pennsylvania will be a bit less trying by the time I hit them, hence, the start in DWG instead of Harper's Ferry. Could be wrong---one way to find out. I've changed the initial gear I'll be carrying from that which I carried last time starting in Maine. Not much, but keeping the expected weather in mind.     I've 3 months to continue becoming fitter for the trek. Still working out 5 days a week for about an hour and a half each day; cardio and strength. Still have quite a bit of work to finish on the house before I go. Christmas is tomorrow; not planning on working out, instead, I'll be cooking and eating----my last feast before the trip.Merry Christmas to allsoon to hike on","flip flop

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582621,"It's 2 months til the start of my 2nd attempt at a thru hike. Hoping that starting at Delaware Water Gap, PA will add to my chances of success. I know it's not a traditional hike since I'm not starting at one terminus and heading to the other, rather, I'm starting close to the middle and heading to one end only to have to fly back to the middle to continue in the opposite direction to the other end. If I make it, it will be a thru hike to me.     I continue to work out a few days per week to increase stamina and strength. I have no idea if it will be enough, but I'll be in better shape than I was at the start of my 1st attempt. Friends continue to offer their good wishes and positive thoughts, for which I am grateful. I've finalized my gear and initial food selections and have a few resupply boxes that I'll be sending soon to my brother. He'll be my resupply box holder and mailer. I'm not expecting to use mailed resupply too often; maybe just for cold/hot weather gear exchanges.     Still don't have my house fully up to self sustaining condition, but should by departure date.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583160,"Just a month to go and I'll be back on the trail. Definitely stronger now than last June, but haven't lost the weight I'd hoped to. However, with my flip flop starting point being less strenuous than last year's, I should be able to lose weight over the first few days and weeks as I head north. My blood glucose seems to be well controlled, to the point where my endocrinologist believes I should be fine on the trail without meds. Believe I learned a hard lesson re: hydration and electrolyte imbalance on last attempt! Fully stocked with electrolyte replacements this time.
     Other than having an ongoing issue getting my roof repaired, my house is basically on a ""set it and forget it"" status and, with neighbors' occasional check up, should be fine while I'm gone. Great security system installed and neighbors keeping an eye on things. Having xeriscaped my yard last year and having removed the swimming pool has left few, if any, maintenance issues to worry about while hiking. 
     Here's to not letting my friends, well-wishers, and my self down a 2nd time.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585359,"Three days until I hit the trail again. A bit worried that I jumped the gun and am starting a week too early, but now it is late to change reservations and plans. The weather on the northeast coast has not been favorable and I expect colder temps. and wetter conditions than originally planned for. I will, therefore, be carrying a bit more weight(almost 3 lbs) than I was expecting to start. Que sera, sera. 
     Got my pack weight down to less than 28 lbs without water a few weeks ago, but have added back another 3 due to anticipated cold weather. So I'm concerned that the heavy pack may be an issue for me as I've discovered that with less than 29 lbs on board, the pack is comfortable, but with more weight, it becomes unwieldy. Hoping for the best, of course, and expecting that I can physically handle the hike this time. 
     On the home front, my roof, for which I signed a contract last April, still isn't done(skylights and shake replacement). I've had to acquire legal assistance and am now on a path I've never had to take before. Have to rely on my neighbors to keep an eye on the progress which is supposedly scheduled to begin next week. Much concern over that! Rather than develop an ulcer over this, I'll just assume all will be well.
    Spent my last day in the gym yesterday and am tying up loose ends over the next couple days. Not looking forward to the cab trips and connecting flights on Tuesday. A little anxious, but it's the same as my first thru hike attempt last year; once there, for the most part, the anxiety disappeared.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585728,"After a long day in the air and taxis, I’m at the beginning of my hike, Spending a couple days waiting out the weather here in a poor excuse for a hotel. Temps in the 40s during the day, hi 20s to low 30s at night. It appears I’ll be doing some winter hiking for a while. Had my gear forwarded via UPS to “Edge of the Woods” outfitters and picked it up this AM. He (chuck, the owner) opened just for me. Didn’t realize that they were closed for the season. Great guy.

Tomorrow will be another short day and the day after. Water is an issue springs around here are few and far between. Carried 4 liters today and will hopefully find water before Wednesday. I don’t dare cook this evening for fear of using too much much.

It isn’t the weather that has me worried; took a tumble first thing this morning—-broke one of my hiking poles and pretty sure my left 2nd toe.

Tomorrow will make it into Wind Gap and probably spend some time and money. I know a pretty slow start—-I’ll get faster.

Greensleep,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587008,"Harbingers proved accurate. Last week as I was descending a steep rocky slope, I took another spill. This one was bad. Landed on my hip after twisting to the side during the fall and injured my R knee. Got off the trail again and got to an orthopedic clinic where I was told to apply ""rice"" to my  knee(rest, ice, compression, and elevation) and to rest my hip. Spent a few days doing that and although my hip is now functional, my knee is no better, with some swelling and significant pain when I bend it. So, once again, flew home yesterday and am now resigned to the fact that my health issues will keep me off the trail, at least for a thru hike. Hopefully, I'll be able to tackle section hikes in the future. This will depend on what happens with the knee; maybe surgery, don't know yet.      Yet again, I have to disappoint my friends and family that have supported my efforts. I can't thank them enough for the emotional and intellectual bolstering given me showing their belief in my strengths. I would like nothing more than to be writing a journal entry from the trail heading south! These flights north and south are beginning to be expensive. Next time I think I'll take a train or bus.     My brother now has quite a few useless full resupply boxes for me that he'll be sending back to  Florida. I'll be eating trail food for a while, might heat it up over my ""pocket rocket"" camp stove just to pretend. My hiking gear will fill up one of my closets. I'd love to think I'll be using it by this time next year on section hikes or local hikes.      This is my last entry; my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail is over. Again, I thank all that have followed my short bumpy journey and lent their support! As the cliche states ""when one door closes, another opens"". Hopefully, the disappointment of this closed door will lead to the opening of another leading to enjoyable adventures. wishfully, some day hiking on","PA
