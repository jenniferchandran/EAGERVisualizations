Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586002,"Day 7- With all the cold weather, have only hiked 28 miles so far. It has been in the 20's on two nights in the mountains. Too cold for me, I think. Or, I am afraid to try it out and be stuck outside when I find it too cold. Have made the Howard Johnson in Daleville homebase. A fellow hiker, Purple Haze, and I have hiked days and returned to HJ to sleep. He is a faster hiker, so we don't hike together, but Purple Haze waits for me to share shuttle rides and cost. We are starting an 11 mile hike tomorrow, Sunday 4/8/18. Then, Monday will be another zero day as temps. in the 20's and snow/rain is forecast. Yesterday's 6 mile hike was my best hiking day so far. Probably because it was sunny and I was slackpacking with just a small pack. Slack packing is so much easier than hiking with a full pack. But, paying for a motel and 2 shuttles per day is costly. For now I am spoiled!After tomorrow's hike, I will have completed 40 trail miles. It is starting to feel like a hike. When I hit 100 miles, triple digits, I will believe I am a thru-hiker. If the weather gets a little nicer, it will be easier to get 100 miles in.Thank you to all my family and friends who have supported my in doing the AT hike. And thanks to all my fellow hikers who have coached me on trail stuff.","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586226,"Day 8 - Snow, more snow, and cold. Started out hiking in snow and 26 degree temp. on Sunday. Ended the hike with sunshine and 50 degrees. Completed 11.4 miles, my longest day so far. Monday was just as cold, still snowing, and I did not try hiking. Tomorrow, Tuesday, April 10th, I will start out northbound at Apple Orchard, trail mile 770, with a steep uphill climb to the "" guillotine"", a rock formation. If I can complete 8 miles hiking, I will get 3,000 lower in elevation and at least 10 degree warmer temps. That will be my goal. After this cold spell, temps. are supposed to warm up. Thank you God.","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586669,"Had to give you a picture of the best shuttle drivers. Also being trail workers. they knew all the trails well and the little known points for pick ups and drop offs. They were life savers getting us to and from cold, snowy trails.With warm weather in the forecast started back on the trail at the bottom of Apple Mountain. After snowy hiking passed under the guillotine rock and then came to a radar tower at the mountain top. After a hard and long 9 mile hike, stayed at Marble Springs tent site. Next day was another hard and long 9 mile hike ending at Johns Hollow Shelter. The next day was supposed to be another 9 miles to Punch bowl Shelter. The 3rd 9 uphill miles proved too much. My BFF hiking buddy, Purple Haze (the beer) agreed and we dry camped at Saltlick Gap. Completely out of water, the next day was a challenge 4 miles to a road for a shuttle pick up.Water shortage in the past, sore muscles still aching, it is recuperation time at Stanimals Hostel. I have completed 70 trail miles, but do feel the strain.","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586686,"Picture is of the guillotine, most notable here for the snow and ice on the trail. This is day 14, a zero miles hiking day of recuperation. So, now it is time to tell anout some of the trail characters I have met. There is Power House, a young female high mileage  thru-hiker who hikes in sandals. Or Control Z, also a young female high thru-hiker who was taking 3 weeks off to finish graduate school in NH before returning to finish her hike. Yesterday I met Double Vision who has an admirable and more relaxed SOBO hiking plan. He hikes from shelter to shelter and takes days off whenever he feels like it. He probably only averages 6 or 7 miles on hiking days. I should probably start doing the same to enjoy the hike more. Purple Haze is my adopted coach and mentor. He shares his hiking wisdom and we have always managed to end the day at the same location since first meeting in Daleville. He also walked down a steep hill to get us water when we were both severely dehydrated. I am sure that saved me from some serious medical issues.There are so many character to meet on the trail, and very, very few that aren't enjoyable. This truly is an adventure. ","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586789,"Today is Sunday, April 15th. Thunderstorms will be starting today, this is my last rest day, and 3 of attended services at St. John's Episcopal in Glasgow, VA. The 3 of us hikers included 2 retired law enforcement. In talking to the preacher and his wife, I found they were both retired FBI. It sometimes is a small world.Monday morning, Purple Haze and I are back on the trail. We are starting at the Blue Ridge Parkway shortly after the AT passed Punchbowl Shelter. Purple Haze is still having problems with his Achiles, and after  a couple days rest I am mostly pain free for the first time since my April 1st start.Both Purple Haze and I want a less painful hike, so lower mileage days fits us. I hope his Achiles holds out and we can continue hiking together. It seems to work out. Next town stop will likely be in about a week in Waynesboro. Right after that is Shenandoah National Park.","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587637,"Finally passed 100 miles on the AT. I have hiked about 125 miles, and will reach Shenandoah National Park probably by the end of tomorrow. The last few days have been tough hiking for me. Did the trail passing the Priest, and the 3 Ridges Wilderness the next day. Three Ridges has rocks as large as small cars on the trail. I am still the slowest hiker, but I persevere and am the last one in. Now my feet are really beat up and I may need to take some recovery time. After 3 weeks on the trail, my trail legs are still in the making.","

Bucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588477,"Purple Haze caught up with me at Blackrock Hut. We don't hike together or at the same pace, but enjoy comparing notes evenings. Last night we watched other hikers smoking weed around the picnic table at Blackrock. We were invited and declined. The morning started with a 600 foot climb over 1/2 mile, but the rest of th day eas great hiking. The picture of the pile of rocks is Black rock Overlook at the end of the 600 foot uphill. I ended at Doyle River Overlook meeting up with Purple Haze. We got a shuttle back to a hostel as a night camping would be about 30 degrees.Today is relax at the hostel, do laundry, buy more stove fuel and restock food. In the morning, it is back on the trail in Shenandoah National Park.","
