Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518747,"It's good to take time to reflect on the past if only for a brief moment to take into account lessons learned and thank God for opportunities given. Looking back at 2015 has given us much to be thankful for as it pertains to hiking! 
After thru-hiking the Foothills in 2014, we find ourselves continuing to return this trail with its wide variety of terrain and beauty. We hit it 4 times in differing places this year with a total of 50 miles.
We also did a bit of section hiking on the AT for a total of 60 miles!!! (Sam's Gap-Nolichucky TN, Franconia Ridge NH, and the Approach trail GA) 
We also hiked at Congaree Nat. Forest, Piscah Nat. Forest, and Harmons, Jamaica for an additional 15 miles.
Not a bad year!!!
If I was to choose one lesson learned from the year it would be from our Franconia hike in July. We learned that we need to pay very close attention to the weather and change plans if need be for safety sake! Even in July, high wind and rain could kill you when above tree line! The flip side to that was the motivation in feeling that if I could do that, I could conquer almost anything!","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518831,"Rick (Forceflex) surprised me with a trip this weekend to scope out our entry and exits points for our hike next year through the Shennandoah's. (He included an overnight at a B&B and a wine tour.)
Hiking as a couple has different challenges and rewards than when you are on your own. The obvious challenges are adjusting to different physical strengths and weaknesses. Forceflex has had to learn a lot of patience and adjust expectations simply because I am so much slower than he is, especially on the ups.
Other challenges are adjusting to each other's personalities, especially as it pertains to setting and reaching goals. Foreflex's personality thrives when there are measurable goals to achieve and he enjoys the planning and details involved in getting there. I'm more of the spontaneous, free-spirit of the two. It's not that I don't like having a plan but I'm far less likely to spend time working out the kinks of a plan. Having these two different approaches to life in general can bring conflict to most marriages but after 35 years, I guess we've both learned to appreciate the value of the other side of things. It's hard at times but when we give in to the others way, I believe we end up with more healthy and balanced perspectives. Realizing that our weaknesses can be strengths and vice verse is an important frame of mind we will need to remind ourselves of often when we spend day after day together on the trail.
I am thankful to be able to hike with a partner who takes the time to plan for us. Because of his attention to detail, we might actually reach the goal of thru-hiking the AT in 2018!","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518841,"I'm not much of a journaler but it's good to put thoughts down sometimes to gain perspective on all that juggles in the brain. With that in mind I am going to attempt to write a bit as it pertains to a growing dream of thru hiking the AT. The more I hike the more I dream!
Forceflex and I have put a date in writing. It seems a long ways off but will likely require that time for testing gear, planning, and the saving of money for an event such as this. 
Christmas and New Years celebrations have a way of coming quickly as we grow older, sometimes marking notable changes. Looking back can be nostalgic. Looking ahead motivating. It all has its place in this thing we call life. 
Preparing for big events or holidays require much attention. I suspect thru-hiking preparation will required a similar demand. 
For all the experiences behind and those yet to come, I am greatful. 
My goal is to enjoy the ride as much as the destination.","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519484,"The road we live on is a pretty one. There is still undeveloped land on sections of the road with views into the woods. It is 3 miles round trip and I try and walk 3-4 times a week just for excersise. The funny thing is, it's more than just excersise because there isn't a time when I'm out there that I don't dream about really being in the woods, our next hike, or what it will be like to thru hike the AT! It's a far cry from the real deal but it is motivating non the less.","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522185,"Katadin is nothing...without the journey that leads us there. I read of Nobo's who experience a let down of sorts and immediately start questioning ""what now?"" after reaching their infamous goal of Mount Katahdin. I'm not trying to negate the fact that their won't be rejoicing in the end but I believe much of the memories and lessons learned will lie in what it took to get there.Today is one of those reminder days to ""stop and smell the roses"". The sun is shining and the temperatures have warmed up. It's good to be outside again and hear the birds announce the coming of Spring. I'm back to walking my 3 mile road 4 times a week again after a welcomed winter's break in the Domincan Republic.   I and am all too happy for pause buttons along life's way and also very motivated to get back on the trail...soon.","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522591,"Rick, ""Forceflex"", mentioned in his journal about a time during our first thru-hike of the Foothills trail when had a meltdown (or two, or three).   He got me thinking about that time so I thought I'd add my perspective...First, you have to understand, I rarely cry. For for me to have a meltdown three times in one day was a record, alarming, and at the very least, something to take note of! I remember being exhausted and having little strength that day. Whether it was from the extreme heat, the long miles, the poison ivy that grabbed me early in our hike, the benedryl taken for the poison ivy, or the constant ups, I don't know...I suspect it was a little of all of the above. I just remember telling myself ""we're almost there"" a thousand times only to encounter yet another steep climb. I cried all the way to camp.  To say that I love hiking is probably an understatement on any given day but at that moment I questioned my commitment and that made me sad. I was disappointed in myself, wondering if I was really cut out to do what I loved so much. I guess we all have those times of self doubt when fantasy meets reality and we have to question our resolve.That night we ate a hot meal and Forceflex wisely told me to sleep on it and see how I felt in the morning...I woke up ready to continue our journey. Sometimes you just need to shed a few tears, eat a hot Mountain House meal, and close your eyes to get your perspective back!","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529629,"Hiking lessons learned: #1) It can get winter cold in the mountains in April...Bring ALL my base layers.It was as cold as I can remember experiencing at night. (Low 30's). I had four layers up top, and one layer below on the first night (plus a liner and 20 degree bag) and I was still cold! I remembered my hat and gloves but didn't think I needed the bottoms so I opted instead to save the weight...I was wrong. Thankfully Forceflex let me use his on our second night and it made all the difference. #2). Be proactive early on with hotspots. I should know by now that the sides of my Big toes are blister prone when walking more than 5 miles at a time but I don't do anything about it until the end of the day or the next day! I'm going to try ""hiker goo"" from the start next trip as well as moleskin and see if that helps.It's amazing the clarity of mind on these hikes. Maybe it's the excersise or the quietness and beauty of it all, or both, but every time I go out I learn something about life and it's purpose as to how God intends for us to live. So, My Spiritual Applications learned: ""It is about the journey but it's also about the destination""! Whether getting to the next stop for lunch and a nap or dinner or camp...having short term perks keep me moving forward, even some times at a ""one step at a time"", very turtle slow pace. Translation?...keep God's goodness and eternity in mind as it will enable me endure the difficulties this world affords. Sometimes life is straight with duff under our feet, sun warming our shoulders, and a stream of water gurgling besides us. Other times it's a very slow and painfully steep climb with little relief in sight. Either way, thanks be to Jesus Christ, I'm headed to a destination of hope, and rest, and reward! Focus on such a bright future enables me to move through this journey we call life with great anticipation and endurance.","Ceasars Head

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534260,"Whenever we go visit our grand baby, we also make it a point to visit REI. We don't have REI in our neck of the woods and REI is this hiker's candy story. Their stuff isn't cheap, but the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"", frequently applies here. I am a fan. Our tent, my backpack, poles, and many clothing items all come from this company and it's served me well.At a recent trip to REI we fell prey again to the very cool $35 Patagonia t-shirts! What strikes me as funny is that the majority of people who can and do spend money on such a brand are really nothing more than a bunch of ""dreamers"". At this point, I put myself in that category too because although to a certain degree, I want to live more simply and spend more time in the woods, I make choices (like buying expensive t-shirts) that keep me married to more work and less play. The irony is that the more Patagonia t-shirts I buy the more I have to work to pay for it and the less time I take to do what the t-shirt I just bought represents! Kudos to Patagonia for tapping into all the dreamers in this world. Kudos also to all those hikers out there who make dreams reality and somehow learn to say no to the things that get in the way of making their dreams come true.Bottom line, we choose our priorities. Some choose to work less to play more while others work more and play less. It's an interesting balance to achieve. We all want the best of both worlds and at times we all find ourselves caught on one extreme or another all the while longing for something more.I suspect that leaving everything behind to hike the AT for 6 months is no exception to the rules of maintaining ""balance"". The whole ""work a little, play a little"" attitude requires careful attention and purposeful planning. I'll keep striving... Can't wait to get there some day!","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541996,"It had been a couple of months since Forceflex and I had hiked so although part of me was excited about getting back on the trail, the other part of me was a little nervous about whether I was ready for whatever I might face. As it turned out, this ended up being the best hike yet.I was pleasantly surprised with the views at Max Patch Summit and I thought the hike itself was a nice blend of ups, downs, and straights. Hiking this time of year has its challenges with heat, taller grasses, and overgrown weeds. Still, there are advantages to hiking in the summer not the least of which is the variety of berries beginning to ripen along the paths. The blackberries were every where but not yet ripe. A few of the blueberries however has begun to turn their purple/blue color and although the thunder was rolling in, I could not resist stopping along the way to pick a handful of these natural delights. Forceflex gently encouraged me to move along and save some for the animals. I assured him that I would not take much longer and told him to go ahead of me. I reasoned in my mind (maybe foolishly) that lightening would not strike me in this shorter grove of rhododendron, especially when it had so many taller trees to pick from. As it turned out, the lightening never came and in turn I thoroughly enjoyed one of the simplest pleasures trail life offers, wild blueberries!  We started and finished our time in the sweet town of Hot Springs North Carolina. Many thanks to the excellent shuttle service that we arranged through the town's Outfitters. It is one of the few towns that has the AT passing through it so I shouldn't have been surprised that it was so friendly to hikers. I loved the variety of places to eat offering great food at decent prices. I found the Outfitters store to be one of the best, with a great variety of services and goods. I was also surprised at the ease of availability and reasonable cost of the Mineral Springs hot tub. ($38 for two for one hour) They gave some good tips on what to expect when the hiker ""bubble"" hits them in the spring. (Early mornings and weekdays best) It was all perfectly wonderful! This is definitely a town we will want to do a zero at when we attempt our AT thru-hike! Looking forward to going back again.","Max Patch Summit

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548124,"It was Forceflex's birthday so I suggested he find a way to take an extra day off so we could get back on the trail. He did and planned a hike for us leaving Sunday after church through Tuesday. We didn't start walking until 5pm and I'm not a huge fan of hiking in the dark so he kept the plan short. However, we neglected to account for all the extra people on Labor Day and it was obvious to us that the first shelter plan was too crowded so we walked on. Plan B was put in place to stop at the first stealth site we saw. It was considerably longer than we thought but we managed to find one just as it was growing dark. I prayed along the way, knowing God wasn't to going too magically clear something for us before dark but believing that whatever the outcome He would open my eyes to see His goodness in the result. I was thankful for a quiet destination just as it started getting dark The next morning, discovering by the light of day how close we were to the Barn, we took the opportunity to visit it and discover its beauty. Never have I seen a shelter like this. It was amazing. The barn and it's setting was like something out of a magazine. It is now a must stop on our list of must stops in 2018! The next day we leisurely got up and hiked back to Carver's Gap. After lunch on this amazing 360 bald with perfect skies and temperatures in the 70's we decided to move in the other direction to the next shelter at the top of Roan mountain. There were lots of water stops on the map but we soon discovered that most were dry and thought about turning back. Instead we walked just a little further and hoped for something and sure enough, there was something. Small and requiring a bit of creativity to capture it but we got enough water to get us through the night and continued our hike to the top. The trail was lined with Balsaam trees and it smelled like Christmas the entire way up! The shelter however was ""less than"". Whether it was because of my comparison to where we just were or because of the millions of flies everywhere, I don't know, but I decided then and there that I needed to convince Forceflex to go back down the mountain and camp on the top of Carver's Gap. He wasn't really for the idea but relented non-the-less. By the time we got back, the Labor Day crowds were gone and we were the only ones setting up camp there. We settled in and were rewarded with incredible views, and a great sunset and sunrise.Lessons learned:1) once again, always plan yet always be prepared for a change to those plans. So much about hiking really is ""trial and error"".2) practically speaking, although I like having the tube for easy water access from the platypus in my pack, it takes up valued space and isn't convienant to refill without emptying much of my pack first. Next time I am going to try out a tube system from a bottle. 3) 50 degrees is cold to me at night. (I should have remembered this from previous hikes!) Even with my 20 degree bag, I need to remember to bring warmer layers. Lord help me when the real cold hits!","Carver's Gap, NC

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550071,"Why hike the AT? (Note to self when I need a reminder!)1. Simplify. Get away from the stuff and consumerism. Can't get any simpler than living out of your backpack and wearing the same clothes everyday for 5-6 months straight! I will breathe the fresh air (not myself or the hikers around me!) drink clean water (hopefully!), be hungry (and be filled), and let it be enough.2. Experience nature. I want the full-on experience, learn to take the good and the bad and appreciate them both. I will confront God on His terms & return to the relationship that brought me to Him from the start!3. Socially. AT has some of the coolest people. Can't wait to meet them.4. Physically. Challenge myself beyond anything I've ever done before. Should I finish this, I will have accomplished a goal bigger than life!5. De-tox. It will afford me the opportunity to take a sabbatical from everyday life. It's the ultimate in ""Getting Outta Town"" and taking a break from real life responsibilities. I can take the time to ""just be"" and in so doing, refresh the mind and soul. 6. I will quit my job and leave a lot of people behind in the process, including my grand-babies, so I better make it count!!","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551806,"This Thanksgiving we rented a house in the Shenandoah Mountains, close to the AT which afforded us the opportunity to be with our two sons and daughter in law. We also got some hiking in! (Being with family in the mountains and hiking...two of our favorite things). We walked up a pretty good incline from the house to the AT entrance via a service road and headed in two different directions in two different days. The trail both ways was mild on the ups and downs and beautiful. With most of the leaves down, we got to see more of the woods and mountains! The cooler temps (upper 30's one day and 40's another) made for great hiking,..less sweating, and no bugs or cob webs!I was surprised at how few people were out.   With Big Meadows shut down and holiday obligations, the trail was pretty much all ours except for one SOBO trying to make up time.The few people we did meet this week made our trip all the more interesting and fun.One person we met was the wife of the owner at a local winery in the valley. She gave us great information about their farm, it's history, and how they do business. She also informed us to keep a look out for bears as she recently had the door of her car broken into by a bear because she left some gluten free crackers in the car! The cook at the Irish Pun in Luray shared similar stories about the boldness of the bears. Seems they are getting braver in this area. Good reminder to keep all food and smelly stuff out of our tent and continue our practice of hanging bear bags!Another conversation we had this week was with the grounds keeper at Big Meadows Lodge about the history of the place. Turns out much of its history was past down from his grandparents! I found his story fascinating.Lastly, we got to meet Rich, who is the caretaker for the house we rented. He used to cook at Skyline and now is a ""jack of all trades"", not the least of which involves raising chickens and canning fresh fruit and veggies. We bought a lot of delicious food from him and asked him to consider being our shuttle next year when we hike the entire Shenandoahs! He said yes, so now we have a point of contact to get us from A-B!I am blessed and thankful for the opportunities afforded us this week. We got to experience so many great people, our wonderful family, the beauty of nature, and the sound of silence. I feel refreshed because of it.","Tanners Ridge Drive-Shenandoahs, VA

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553671,"So I quit my job and am now beginning a new chapter in my life.   I feel that I went out on a high note and on top of my game. I left well and I feel good about that! I knew I was going to have to quit in a year to go on this thru-hike but several things pointed to my need to step that timetable up. Although quitting obviously means less money, it also means more time, and that's something that will prove valuable to me in many more practical ways than I can mention here. One benefit for sure is that this will allow ""Forceflex"" and I the ability to get in more hikes in preparation for 2018. Not having to coordinate two schedules should greatly assist in that effort.   I also plan on stepping up my game in physical fitness to include strength traiining. Quite honestly, I'm pretty weak and I've read enough to know that I will need all the help I can get if I plan to make it thru to the finish line. The more we read, the more we wonder if we have what it takes to make it! There's some pretty scary stuff to overcome along the way! I understand that what we read can become bigger than life in our minds, either from the writer's perspective (who is proud to have conquered it and exaggerates the story), or from our own thoughts (that gets carried away with the fear of it all).   I have experienced this to some degree when we hiked the foothills. We had read and heard about the ""million"" (my exaggeration) stairs we had to climb on this one section and the closer we got to that point, the greater my anxiety became. As it turned out, my imagination made it far worse than what it really was. Of course the flip side has happened too, where I was taken by surprise and it totally kicked my butt!    So the bottom line for me is this, no matter how much I prepare, I really won't know unless I try. My hope is that I will be prepared enough physically and mentally to overcome all obstacles.  I will also take to heart the saying ""never quitting on a bad day"". That way, if I have to go out (and I truly hope I won't), I will rest assured that I gave it my best. For all that is in my power to do so, I must do my best to only go out on a high note.","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555695,"One of the things I am looking forward to on our thru-hike is the people we will meet along the way. Trail people, especially thru-hikers have a certain mentality about them that is appealing to me. To say that they are willing to get ""down and dirty"" is probably an understatement and a bit of play on words but there is something to be said when pretenses and appearances are shed as purposefully as the makeup and trim hair is abandoned. The notion that you need a lot of stuff to make you happy is tested by a willingness to live with only the bare necessities stuffed into backpacks for months at a time. I believe that this this kind of minimalist attitude can be the beginning point of all kinds of revelations. Letting go and emptying out in order to receive is one of the great ironies of life and not something we easily surrender to. Because stuff and agendas have the propensity to consumes our time, before we know it life can pass us by without any thought given to God, people, or the meaning of it all around us. This is the stuff that Trail Angels have discovered and something we all long for somewhere in a hollow place in our heart. It's been referred to as magic but I think it's deeper than that and can only be received by those who are willing put their mind in that place of abandonment. Most Thru-hikers have acknowledged the fact that jobs, accomplishments, and routines around them do not in and of themselves satisfy. They embrace the idea of stepping away for a challenge of a life time. I am not suggesting that all the-hikers are out there to ""find themselves"" but by willingly stripping themselves of life's luxuries and immersing themselves in the sometimes quiet and peaceful or sometimes unpredictable and violent surrounding called nature, they are poised perfectly to receive all sorts of revelations, whether they are looking for them or not!There is a certain humility that the trail will require of those of us that follow it thru and that is one reason reason why I am looking forward to meeting such a cast of characters who choose the path the AT takes us on during our thru-hike in 2018.","

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557009,"Last week was a good week of hiker preparation for me. I was able to get 2 hikes in with friends during the week. One at our local park at Dreher Island, SC for 6 miles and another 6 miles later that week with a friend at Paris Mountain in Greenville, SC. The weekend topped it all as Force Flex and I followed thru with our plans to hike out of Hot Springs going in the opposite direction from what we did last year. The weather forecast was for cold and rain but we went anyways. It was freezing as we got out of the car but as soon as we started our hike up the mountain we warmed up quickly and as the day went on the temperatures rose is well. We were graced with some unexpected sunshine and clear skies for our 5 miles climb. We found a spot to set up our tent before the rain came pouring down. Our tent worked great in the rain and wind, keeping us and our gear dry. It was still raining lightly in the morning but we packed everything up in a dry tent. That left only the tent wet which we divided up between us in the bottom of our packs. The extra water weight was hardly noticeable.I learned a few things from this trip:#1-invest in a heavier weight bottom layer for sleeping. Thankfully it was 40° outside but the ground was still frozen from the week before.   FF was fine but I was my wimpy cold self. Despite a thermal sleeping pad , a 20° sleeping bag, and a Costco quilt my legs were still cold for the majority of the night! I had light weight base layers on with dry socks but I still felt the cold coming up from the ground. I kept waiting for those hot flashes to kick in but ironically that was not to be this time so I added the silk liner into my sleeping bag and that gave me the extra warmth I craved. It's more restrictive but as long as I stayed still I manage to stay warm (off and on) for the rest of the night. 2. My winter top layers up top work great! (wool tank, wool short sleeve, long sleeve base layer and long sleeve wool) Add puffy to that at camp and I was toasty!3. I'm glad I had liners for my gloves. Good purchase.4. I'm very happy with my new bottle system. My new handy dandy clip on bottle holder was awesome! Goodbye bladder hello bottles.5. Soaking in the mineral water at Hot Springs is worth the money. Thankfully FF was smart enough to stop in the day before and make a reservation. They happened to have a cancellation that worked out for us. Next time we'll call ahead or make sure we don't show up on a weekend!I am encouraged that I survived the wet and cold without too much misery. Although we did have the advantage of knowing we were going to town the next day, I still feel a little better prepared for what possibly lies ahead of us one year from now!","Hot Springs, NC

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558102,"Tuesday I headed back to Greenville, SC with a friend to hike Paris Mountain. We filled our packs with a good 20 plus pounds of weight and put in 7-1/2 miles. We ended up taking a trail that circled a lake and had a great conversation with a man who recently retired and moved down from Ohio. He had biked across America and hiked several famous mountains and was wearing a half marathon t-shirt. He was way out of our league and fun to talk with. It's always refreshing to run into people my age who commit to staying physically fit and enjoy the outdoors. The day was sunny and warmed into the 80's with a cool breeze every now and again. Perfect weather, until you find yourself on a trail that has no switchbacks and climbs straight up, and up, and up again! It got hot! We were surprised this mountain offered such a challenge and although I turned into my typical turtle up climbing self, I was encouraged that I wasn't alone, as my friend was about the same slow speed! It's hard to imagine doing double those kind of miles on the AT but I'm going to believe that my strength and speed will kick in after doing it day after day. In the mean time, I'm having fun preparing.","

Ever since we thru-hiked the foothills trail back in 2014 I've wanted to return to this particular section that was located along a river with picnic tables scattered throughout! The foothills is one of the greatest secrets out there in that it's beauty and variety of terrain is equal to or surpasses most trails. It also offers its own unique challenges. In order to get to this beautiful camping destination, we had to climb a lot of stairs through Heart Break Ridge. Picnic Tables was a luxury I was willing to climb 270 plus stairs for. It was well worth it!! There was plenty of beauty along the way which motivated me as well.

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561471,"Each time we go out we narrow down or discover a product that remains a keeper or discarder for the next trip. This time I tested the following items:1. An empty Gatorade jar for a pee-cup at night. This Curly Turtle isn't interested in climbing in and out of the tent several times at night to empty her bladder. I've experimented in the past with a variety of things that partially worked but thanks to my hubby's suggestion, I have landed on this perfect solution. Let's just say, it's the perfect size and having a twist on top gives peace of mind from potential tipping! Once cleaned out, I stuff my toiletries baggy in so it's not taking up dead space in my pack. It's a keeper.2. Bounty paper towels with Dawn in them. I never knew they existed until my fellow hiker friend, Barb, was telling me about how she bought them by mistake and how they could be useful on the trail. I cut them into pieces, put some in a baggy, and with a little water they soaped right up! Very light weight, they were perfect for washing dishes or the pee-cup and make a great substitute for washing hands with soap! It's a keeper.3. Powdered peanut butter. Who knew? I saw it on the shelf and realized it weighed half of a regular jar so we tested it out. Taste wise, its great and I love that you can make it different consistencies depending on how much water is added. The negative is that it's messy and has less fat which we kind of want when hiking. We put some in a baggy and it worked well enough but we're not sure if what we save in weight is worth the mess. It's a maybe, the jury is still out on it.","Laurel Falls, Foothills Trail, SC

Curly Turtle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566438,"Shenandoah's Day 1
I awoke at 5am and began the day listening to the rain and thinking of all the reasons to be thankful...
1-I've been married to FF for 36 years today!  It's appropriate for us to be spending this anniversary on the trail.  It is one place we both love being and we are fortunate to have that in common.   So few couples share such a love with each other let alone a mutual hobby.  I thank God today for allowing me  to have so many great adventures with such a wonderful man.  This morning he surprised me with a beautiful bracelet that was made by my dear friend Barb (who happens to be hiking with us). He is so thoughtful and will always remind me of this time in our lives.
2-Despite last nights rain, I remained dry and comfortable!  Temps in the 50's at night make for great sleeping.  I'm thankful for this tent that we got up last night before the rain came pouring down.  We hiked in at 10pm from the 4-H center in the dark and found a spot around 11pm.  The rain came at 11:01!
3-My ""Pee-cup"" keeps me from going out in the rain at night...big deal.
4-Lastly, I'm thankful to be hiking with people who are ready to embrace this adventure we are on with great attitudes.  The trail is full of beauty but one of the great things about the AT are the fun people we meet along the way.  So many inspiring folks out there!
It's 330pm and we are at Gravel Springs Hut and the tent is up.  We were prepared to hike in the rain today but it stopped and remained a beautifully cool, partly-cloudy day!  What a blessing.

Last night we had great conversations around the picnic table.  Rick recognized a couple from trail journals.  They are always surprised to meet someone who is reading their entries and knows them by name.  
All the while we were enjoying each other's company, a ""hangry bear"" decided to explore a couple tents and Barb and a thru hiker named El Vago had their tent, and sleeping pads destroyed as well as some other things.  There was no food, just toothpaste so the bear must have left frustrated.  As a result, us and all our new friends took our tents down and piled into the hut for the night.  Definitely one for the memory books!
It was a cold day today but thankfully the rain held off until we got to the shelter.   We were up at 5:00 am again, leaving by 7:00 am and arriving at 5:00 pm at our current our shelter, Birds Nest #3.  (Sleeping with new friends again due to the rain and Barb's tent condition) We had several good climbs and are getting ready to call it a night.  
Our big highlights today include running into 3 more thru hikers we've been following on trail journals, taking by a break at the Wayside for breakfast, and landing on a trail name for Barb, ""Heart-E"", because she's always collecting and taking pictures of hearts in nature.

Waking up in a nice warm bed and listening to the sound of the pouring rain does not motivate!  Nevertheless, there are adventures to be conquered so we got up and out the door by 7am.  
Not far down the path and the sun came out for about an hour and our spirits were lifted!  Much of the terrain was level so we make good speed to the Loft Mountain Campground where we purchased some ham, cheese, a microwaved burger, Fritos, and a V-8 (for me) and had ourselves some lunch.  Food can be such a reward when hiking!  We were told that another hiker had stopped and got a cabin and was looking to split the cost but it was too soon to stop so we passed.
We were not too far down the path and the rain came, yet again.  I put my Rain coat and rain skirt (which I absolutely love!) on and we climbed a small mountain.  Our feet got wet from lots of streams flowing down the trail and the mud was everywhere.  
By the time we hit South River Picnic Area, I was tired and started feeling the start of a blister on my heel.  Even though it was only 330, the threat of more rain and uncertainty of Heart-E's tent requiring some jerry-rigging from the bear hole made us scout out a place to stealth camp.  We ended up  tucked away in the woods out of sight from the parking lot.  The good thing about this location. is that there is trash bins, picnic tables, and bathrooms. 
Tomorrow is supposed to be our only non-rain day so we're going to make the most of it!

So, last night we saw our first bear.  Real close.  Too close really.  I am kicking myself for not snapping a picture but at the time we were focused on getting it to move on.  We heard a branch snap and un-zipped our fly to see this medium size bear sauntering by about 10 feet away!  Thankfully all our smelly's and food was hung long before and we ate at the picnic area so there was nothing attractive about us.  Forceflex kept yelling something like, ""get away bear"" and I threw a stick at him. (Lol) The bear didn't even look our way! (Thankfully). We woke Heart-E up from a dead sleep and needless to say, all of us had a tough time getting back to sleep.   
We began with a 620 am start and hiked a lot!  We decided that to make the most of the good weather we should walk as long as the sun was shining.   
The highlights of the day was coming to a big meadow for a lunch break where we dried some of our stuff and rested.  The second highlight was going to a wayside for dinner and re-charging our phones.  It was a big mile day and food was the reward.  I had a black bean burger and my new favorite chips (dill pickle).  We had the famous blackberry shakes which was good but sweet and FF could only finish half of his.
We still had miles to climb to find a stealth camping spot and ended up at the top of the mountain with a few other hikers.  One thing I love about hikers is they go to sleep when the sun goes down. (or sooner!). All was quiet.  I got the best night sleep yet.

This day started early again.  By 7:20 AM we were on our way down the mountain.  Immediately my knees started screaming at me with each step.  I'd never had knee problems before but noticed yesterday that they were starting to hurt.  My downs were slow and half speed which was frustrating for all.  We debated getting off trail but I figured they'd ""warm up"" in time.  They didn't!  By lunch we decided to break at the next shelter where I took 4 Motrin, put cold stream water baggie packs on them, wrapped them up, and drank some Nettle tea (supposedly good for inflammation).  One or a combination of those treatments worked (likely the 4 Motrin!) because I flew through the afternoon. 
By dinner time we finally made it to our water source (there was a long 11 mile stretch without any) and began looking for a place to camp.  There was a storm threatening so we were wanting to get the water and hunker down quickly.  We found a good spot between two streams but it was at the bottom and we feared getting washed away with a storm.  The storm ended up passing us by but without internet we didn't know if more were to come so we chose to hike more, all the while looking for a place to camp.  
The hike meant straight up again and we had extra water.  Everything was overgrown and sloped.  By the time we got to the top, we determined to continue the next climb to the shelter a mile away.  We dumped the extra water and climbed ever so slowly some more.  
When we got to Black Rock Hut shelter the place was packed.  (Oh yeah, Memorial Day). There was no room for another tent and it looked like a party was going down so we got yet more water and took our exhausted selves up again to the top of the Calf mountain where we found a suitable spot.  We positioned the tent around poison ivy, did our chores, ate our last hot stew (which was yummy) and determined to sleep in.  This was our biggest mile day yet.

We slept in to 6:00 AM! (Lol). Our 8 day turned into 7 and we were glad to be hiking short miles today to our car and the famous Mings Chinese Buffet in Waynesboro, VA.  We took our time getting around and I started my morning with tea and once again, 4 Motrin.  
We had one of the steepest mountains to climb today but also some of the prettiest parts of the trail to walk through.  The fog in the fields guarded by wooden gates had us stopping to take a lot of pictures.  The beauty of this section was a great reminder of why we endure the trials that hiking can bring our way.  
Just as hiking has its ups and downs, so to does life.  Having rejoiced in the beauty of the section we just completed and being about one hour from the car, the heavens opened up and the rains poured down hard.  We kept thinking we were getting close but seeming to never get there!  We didn't bother to pull out our rain gear and as a result we were cold and soaking wet.  We finagled getting our dry clothes out an changed quickly outside the car, turning the heat up full blast and plugged in the dying phone to get direction to the Chinese Buffet.  
It was fitting that we ended this hike as we spent most of it...in rain.  ""No pain no gain.""  ""Take the good with the bad.""  The irony of it all.  
Driving back to Front Royal on the highway made it all real.  1 and 1/2 hours of mountains to our right and we climbed every one!  
It was a great week, hard but good.   Tonight I am happy to have a car to get us where we want and a warm, dry bed to sleep in.
Tomorrow we go visit our kids and 2 month old grand baby!  Good stuff.  Until our next adventure...
Happy Hiking Ya'll!!!
