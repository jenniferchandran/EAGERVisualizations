Maximus Decimus Meridius and Litl M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577837,"Really don't know where the idea came to hike a thru hike.  We have been hiking all over the midwest looking for beauty and peace.  But, over 2000 miles is a little different then one of our 10 mile hikes.  But, we are determined to be on the trail May 15th.  I know it will not be easy, there will be days I am cold and miserable, but I am ready for it.  Purchased our packs: Osprey Aura 50 AG for Lil M and a Osprey Atmos 50 AG for Maximus.   Also picked up some treking poles.  Big shout out to Injinji for supporting us with our healing journey by donating socks for our trail hike:  https://www.injinji.com/Ordered all the books we could think of to help us prepare.  Can't wait until May 15, 2018!",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sat",0
Maximus Decimus Meridius and Litl M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577881,"Our books came in today: Appalachian Trail - Thru-Hike Planner, Appalachian Trail -Data Book, and the Appalachian Trail -Thru-Hiker Companion.   I believe we have chosen the Hiker Companion to take with us on the trail.  A lot of good information in the book.  If there is anything else out there that can help us prepare for our hike, please let me know.  Also, does everyone carry a compass or use their phones?  May 15th can not get here soon enough, a lot of planning to do.  Peace and Love to all the hikers out there. Lil M",,View Entry,"Sep 17, Sun",0
Maximus Decimus Meridius and Litl M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578850,"Our tent came in!  We went with the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL3.  We figured we would need the extra space at night.  Can't imagine being dog tired and cramming into a two man tent with our packs.  Not much more weight then the 2 man tent.  Hope we made the right decision with 3 instead of 2 person.  We will see once we start carring our packs.  
We have been training and hiking in a pair of Vibram fivefingers shoes.  They are actually very comfortable and I would not mind wearing these on the trail.  Anyone have any experience with these shoes on the trail?  I can already tell they would have to be replaced often.  
In the meantime; studying all the material we ordered from the AT.  If anyone has any suggestions for which book is the best to bring on the trail; please let me know.Changed our date from May 15th to May 7th.  Planned out our first 3 days of hiking with shelters/campgrounds.  Looking at the shelters and wondering how full they get in the summer?  
Peace out and happy hiking.
