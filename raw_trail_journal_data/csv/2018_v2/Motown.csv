Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/397589,"Happy New Year!This is my first trail entry and I have been waiting for this day. Only 85 days left before I leave my home and fly to Atlanta. I have been planning or at least dreaming about this hike for years. Each year in the spring I would start reading AT thru hiker journals and follow them all summer into the fall. It has been wonderful reading such wonderful and inspirational stories. In 2011, I read Rusty Bumper's journal and was very touched by his challenge.The summer of 2012 I did a good deal of day hiking with my pack and felt I was getting in pretty good shape. Two days after Thanksgiving, while putting up outdoor Christmas lights, I had a fall. The fall caused a concussion , some bumps and bruises to my arms and legs, two broken toes on my left foot and a badly sprained right ankle. It has been over a month since the accident and my left ankle is still sore and unstable. The doctor says it will be at least until the end of January before I can do much conditioning. It has concerned me for the hike, but my daughter Melissa told me I will be okay to start on time. I love the encouragement and support.","

Finish the last few months of work.          2. Finishing up things around the house          3. Finish up plans to ship some food.          4. Get fit.My ankle continues to improve, but it is still sore and unstable and does not allow me to work out like I would like to. It is a concern that it could cause a delay in the start of my hike. What I will continue to do is stay positive and know it will work out as it is suppose to.","

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398051,"This is my third journal entry so my journal should now show up. The first time hiking the AT, my journal was a number of very small notebooks. I read over those written notebooks this week for the first time in 34 years. It reminded me of a wonderful journey and also increased the excitement for this journey. It is great to have ""ATJournals"" to communicate this experience with family, friends, and people like me that have enjoyed others experience. This is also a great source of positive motivation for the hiker.Today I was able to get my boots back on for the first time since my accident. I walked a gentle and slow three miles. It caused some pain and I have a ice pack on my ankle now and I am making progress.Today I went into a local outfitter, ""MooseJaw"" just to look around. The only thing I might add on are some Crocs. In MooseJaw, Jeff, one of their sales people gave me a good education on hiking poles. It is wonderful to have a sales person that is knowledgable and does not try to up sell. I did not purchase anything, but will go back to MooseJaw and Jeff if I decide I need anything.Also today while checking out at ""Whole Food"", Liz C, the young cashier was talking about hiking. She said she has hiked quite a bit on the AT and was looking forward to hiking in Michigan. I am going to drop off some books on hiking in Michigan and the AT for Liz. What a positive young woman.Well that should do it for my third entry and here we go! 73 days!!!","

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398172,"Over the past 40 years I have had two careers. The first six years I spent as a junior high and high school teacher. During those wonderful years I coached track, football and taught biology and chemistry. My second career has been in sales and it has provided for my family and has been rewarding in other ways.I am still working right up to the day before I leave for Georgia. People keep saying I am retiring, and I guess that thought bothers me. There are a good number of goals I still have in life. One of the rewards of this upcoming hike is to find a little more clarity. Three years ago I got the opportunity to go to India for a trek in the Himalayas, and work in a small village, repairing a school. There was a peace and kindness in the villagers. They were so beautiful. I am hoping to find some simple and meaningful experiences on the AT.My grandson turned 7 months old today and I miss him everyday I am traveling. We are blessed that my daughter, son-law, and Grandson live so close. One of the positives around technology is we can send video and pictures and face time. Right now my plans are to get off the trail for five days in June, and go home to celebrate his first birthday. 72 days to go!","Prep.

Today I did do an hour on the treadmill and was able to incline it to 5 without a lot of pain.It was great seeing some hikers sign my trail journal and I was really surprised to see others like Mike from Illinois and Debbie from Canada that will be following my progress. I thought it was important to introduce other members of my family. In the picture from left to right are Stephen, my son who is in his Senior year in college, Sue my wonderful wife, Melissa my daughter holding Taylin James our first grandchild, Taylor my son-in-law, Ekaterina my daughter who is a Junior in college, and me. These are the people I will count on for both support at home and moral support along the way. We do plan on Face Time to be able to see each other. I sure did not have this type of support in 1979.Got all my gear, most of my food, and the first 500 miles planned.

The terrain was rolling and snow covered and it was pretty cold. I completed the hike in 2 hours and 15 minutes. My ankle is still sore, but it continues to improve and I can put more stress on it. I will be traveling all week so my workouts will be in the hotel on a treadmill or elliptical . My plans, if all goes well this week, are to start hiking with my pack next week.Started reading ""Eat and Run"" by Scott Jurek, a ultra marathon runner. So far I have enjoyed the book. It deals with the mental aspect of doing something difficult. It also has some wonderful recipes and my wife and I tried the lentil burgers today. I am also trying a recipe for ankle sprains that he has in the book.My wife, Susan, spent a good deal of Saturday vacuum sealing freeze dried and dehydrated food for the hike. I will do some shipments of food and some purchasing in townsStarted putting some of my gear on this site. Will continue putting on gear as time allows.59 days","

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399256,"One of the big challenges I had in 1979 hiking the trail was being lonesome and out of touch with home and family for 6 to 10 days at a time. In 1979 I was not married, had no children, or grandchildren. I have decided to carry the extra weight to stay in contact with family as much as possible.I will start out carrying both a cell phone and Mini IPad. I will be very sensitive that we are all out for a get away experience and I will be very discrete with both the phone and IPad use. My grandson is just over 7 months old and I want to see him and he see me, and Face Time will help. This week I made some progress on fitness. Everything has been treadmill work and strength training . I had hoped to hike outside this weekend and it snowed and was very cold. Our family has had family members with colds and flu, so I stayed indoors this weekend. 90 minutes on the treadmill yesterday and 75 minutes today with full pack . My ankle is still tender and I need to keep increasing the stress level to see if it will hold-up. I believe it will hold up and I may have to start out slow. Adding TRX training to increase core strength.52 days until I leave for Atlanta and 53 days until Springer Mountain!","

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399644,"Today I had a conversation with my wife( Susan) about the why of this adventure. Sue knows the why. Today I read my journal from the first hike in 1979, and it reminded me of the proposal of marriage when I asked Sue to marry. I asked Sue to marry during our visit in Roanoke, when she visited me. Thirty four years later, Sue is the backbone of our family and the love of my life. Four great kids ( including my son-in-law) and a wonderful grandson.This week I sent my resignation in to the human resource department. The company has been aware of my planned retirement for 6 months and today it became official. I will continue to work until the end of March. I have 45 days before I leave for Atlanta and Springer Mt. My ankle is still a concern and I have an appointment with a orthopedic surgeon this Tuesday.
One of the journal guests asked what was the ""stew"" I used on my ankle sprain? It is two tablespoons of black pepper, two tablespoons of turmeric, and 3 or 4 tablespoons of flour. Mix the ingredients together and add enough water to make a thick paste. Apply the paste to your ankle and rap with a paper towel. Then let sit for an hour or two.

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399900,"The reason I decided to have an on-line journal was for family and friends to share a bit of this adventure and a way of communicating. What I did not expect was the positive comments and encouragement from people I do not know. This week Linda, from Florida, left a message of good wishes, and reminded me of the ""Funk Brothers"". I had not thought of the Funk Brothers in a long time. They were a group of incredible Jazz and Blues musicians that provided the instrumentals for all the Motown entertainers. Someone once said, ""Without the Funk Brothers there would have been no Motown."" Thank you Linda.This week I had a appointment with the orthopedic surgeon. Great new! Though my ankle is not completely healed, it is structurally sound and it should be okay to go in 39 Days.Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement, it is very motivating.Namaste,Motown","

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400595,"It has been an extremely busy week. This week I had planned on being home and training twice a day. The unexpected happened at work and I had to fly back to our corporate office for a meeting Sunday and will be away from home for the next three weeks. My last three weeks of work will be very consuming. My last 14 days of work will be very focused. I owe it to the company I work for, the people I work with, and patients suffering from opioid dependence. What this means is I will not be as physically fit as planned and will start slower than I planned. Maybe that is a blessing. The great thing is my ankle continues to improve and I am excited to start this adventure.Today ""Rusty Bumper"" signed my journal. Rusty Bumper thru hiked in 2011 and I read his journal everyday. In fact this winter I re-read his journal and I plan to read it again the week before I start my trek. Wonderful read and inspiring. Thanks Rusty. 28 days!","Prep.

I live in Michigan and work in Richmond, Virginia so I have a good deal of travel and time away from home. I need to finish projects at work, send out a few food re supplies to start the hike, and have a good deal to get done at home. Oh yes there is also the need to work on conditioning. I am not in terrible shape, but I am not in the shape I planned on. My ankle continues to improve, and I am okay with taking the month of April on the trail to get my cardio conditioning and trail legs. After all I am in no hurry this time.The picture above is from a trek I took in 2009. This trek was to work on repairing schools. ""Save The Children"" organized the trip. It was a life transforming experience. The past 4 years I have continued to raise money and contribute to this organization that helps children world wide. I will continuing to raise money for ""Save The Children"" by getting people to contribute 1 cent per mile I complete on the AT. That would mean a little over $21 per contributor if I complete the hike. ""Save The Children"" is a wonderful organization that is truly making a difference in the lives of millions of children.This weekend I need to get two food shipments ready, seam seal my tent, and get a long hike with full pack.

It did rain last night, but stopped by morning. I got up and ate delicious granola with powdered milk and freeze dried blueberries. Not bad at all. Took down my tent and backed up and caught the picture of the sun rising. It was a cool morning, which helped with the first climb over Sassafras Mt. And then the climb over Justus Mt.

Great game to watch. I was awake at 6 AM and packed my pack, ate breakfast, and was ready to go by 7:30 AM. To bad I could not get a ride to the trail until 9 AM. I called my wife, and then my mother. After that I still had time and met with some other thru hikers and talk about what hikers talk about. Food, equipment, weather, how far you hiking today, and have you seen whomever. We got a ride back to the trail and were hiking by 9:45 AM. Today the weather was sunny and got to 80 degrees. With the two long climbs, everyone I saw on the trail today was struggling a little. I met and hiked for part of the day, with ""Dragonfly"". He just retired from Navy. Dragonfly is a very humble man, who is married and has a 24 year old son and 16 year old daughter. He has lived in many countries. We finished our day at the same place and are camping at Licklog Gap. I have a amazing view out my tent door looking out at the mountains. Well I feel sleep coming on, even before hiker midnight. Good night!
PS. My hiker appetite is starting to kick in and I had a awesome dinner tonight, thanks to my wonderful and supportive wife. I cooked the noddles Sue dehydrated. And I added onion, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and green peppers Sue also dehydrated. A very healthy and taste dinner. Oh, also. Snickers bar for dessert. Thank You Sue!","Winding Stair Gap

Sometime I would come across , Elwood just retired Air Force. During the day I also came across Dragon Fly a just retired Navy veteran.

When my friend Bob and I hiked in 1979, we saw this tree. It was a day in which the wind was blowing through Bly Gap so strong, the tree struck us because it was twisted,. It was so cold that day in 1979, that we did not stop to take a picture. Over the last 33 years I have thought about this tree and how it was shaped by it's environment. This time the weather was perfect and I got the picture, and it is much bigger. It is a great example of how our environment shapes us. Left the Nantahala Out Door center and was hiking at 7:45 AM. This was a very tough day for me. I met a gentlemen coming from the other direction , and he told me to take it slow and easy. He was right. The climb out of NOC was over 3,000 feet, and then there was another 800 feet climb. By the time I got to Stecoah Gap, I was spent and it was only 3:30 PM. All the trail talk was the approaching storm, and I did not want to take a break and recover, and then get caught in the storm going over another difficult climb, Jacob's Ladder. So what I did was find a protective place to camp and was in my tent by 4:30 PM. I had just enough water for the night, and to get me to a water source the next day.The storm did hit at 8:30 PM and lasted to 1:30 AM. There was some wind, a short spell of hail, lots of rain, and blinding lightning, and thunder that made the ground vibrate. At no time did I feel in danger, and I was in the present moment from 8:30 PM to 1:30 AM. After that I fell fast asleep.

I got here at 3:30 PM. Today I experienced the early stages of hypothermia during the hike when I was wet from sweat and the temperature dropped. I recognized the symptoms and put on a jacket, and ate something and warmed up Some of the hikers I have been hiking,with on or off, wanted me to head out tomorrow with them.

My plans are to hike thru the park in 5 nights and 6 days. If you figure that each day you need about two pounds of food, it will take 10 to 12 pounds of food.

This morning I was up early looking forward to hiking the Great Smoky Mountain part of the AT. It took me longer to get to the trail head, were I left off, then I planned, but I was hiking by 10 AM. Hiking from the Dam, which is at 1,700 feet, there is a big climb. The climb was to 4,750 feet. It was a tough hiking day, but I felt good after the day of rest.In the Great Smoky Mountain National Park you have to stay in shelters. A shelter is a three sided structure with an open front. It has two platforms for sleeping, and you can not fully sit-up on either platform. Tonight the shelter is full with fourteen people. One is learning to play the harmonica, four are playing crazy eights, and the other nine people are trying to sleep after putting in 7 to 9 hours of hiking.On the hike up from Fontana Dam I saw the strangest sight. At about 4,000 feet there was a fishing rod that was about 7 ft long, had a big open face spinning reel on it, and was made for catching very big fish in the ocean. The streams in the mountains you would be lucky to catch a six inch brook trout. There was a man sitting on a rock about 2 feet away from the fishing rod. I stopped and ask the man was that his fishing pole. He asked me if he looked like a fool. The gentleman I was talking with was an AT ridge runner who looks after part of the trail. He said the fishing rod was probably left by an AT thru hiker,that after 164 miles of hiking finally realized there is not shark fishing on the trail.The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is a beautiful jewel, but it does have problems.","Fontana Dam

By 10:30 AM the fog and mist had been burned off and it was sunny and warm and the climbs really tired me out. I got to Silers Bald Shelter about 4:30 PM and decided that was enough. There was no one at the shelter, and I started to set-up for the night. A short time later ""Cascade"" came in and decided to stay. It was a nice pleasant evening. Cascade is a 28 year old from Clarkston, Michigan. There was a number of turkeys calling back and forth, and they would come close enough to see a few times. It started to get cold as the sun went down and we were both in our sleeping bags by 8 PM, and because I lost my reading glasses, I was sleeping by 8:30 PM.

At 7:00 AM the young man and his father got up and started a fire. It was wonderful. I thanked them both, and the father said that was the least they could do for waking us up the night before. What a wonderful gift.Today there was a number of milestones. First was a climb up to Clingmans Dome, the highest Mountain on the AT at 6643 feet. It stopped raining and some of the fog cleared by the time I climbed to the top of Clingmans. Some wonderful views. Second there is less than 2,000 miles to hike, still a very long way. Third passed the two hundred mile mark. The hiking today was very green. The forest was mostly conifers, and the mosses were so green and in many shades. It was like walking in a fairy tale. I had planned to hike further today, but I needed to get off the trail to get new reading classes to replace the ones I lost. Most importantly was I needed replacement batteries for my SteriPEN. The SteriPEN is a small like flash light that uses UV light to kill organisms in the water. Very important!I got to Newfound Gap at about 3:00 PM and Cascade had just got there so we hitched hiked into Gatlinburg . I stuck out my thumb and the first car picked us up.

I don't like staying at the shelters for a number of reasons. First, there are to may people. Second, the mice get into everything possible. Third, I sleep better in my tent. In the shelters some people like to go to sleep early and wake up early to hike. There is also the group that wants to stay up late and get up late. You probably can see the conflict.

Next I ran into a hiker passing going South. He was a southbound thru hiker, who started his hike in June 2012 and had health problems that caused him to end his hike 560 miles short. He was back to finish those miles before June 2013. He was very grateful to be hiking again. There are mountains in the South called ""Balds"". These mountains have no trees on top, and there are different opinions as to why they are bald.. Hiking over these mountains can be beautiful, because you have a unrestricted 360 degree view. When it is nice and sunny these balds are a great place to be. When it is cold, rainy, and windy it can be dangerous to your health. Today hiking over the bald mountain ""Beauty Spot"" it was nice and hikers were stopping, eating, and enjoying the view. I stopped to talk with two guys from Columbus, Ohio. They are good friends that are hiking the whole trail, doing it a section at a time. Whatever they could get time each year, they hike a section of the trail. I believe this is their 9th year section hiking. I really enjoyed seeing how good friends they are. One of the hikers said he had packed too much food and wanted to know if I would like some of his wife's homemade chocolate chip cookies? Would I?!!!! He gave me a bag of his wife's awesome cookies and a bag of excellent summer sausage. The cookies and sausage were so good I almost converted to be a Ohio State Buckeye fan. Thank you trail angels!Late in the day more trail magic from ""Honey Badgers"" mom. She had a good deal of food and I just took a strawberry soda and two oranges. I have been craving oranges. Thank you!Today's hike was a mix of hiking along the Nolochucy River, hiking in beautiful pine forests, climbing over a bald in nice weather, meeting interesting people, and getting some wonderful trail magic from some caring people.Life is Good!","Erwin, TN

Motown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/411577,"What I have found, is I enjoy camping at small, beautiful spots, rather than staying at shelters. So when you see campsite for destination, it is just a camping spot I make or fond that someone has used in the past.This morning I woke to a cold rainy morning. Yuck. I had to get out of my sleeping bag, pack everything up, and hike with a wet heavy tent. So what gets me up and out of the warm sleeping bag? Natures Call. I was hiking by 7:45. Today started with a big climb over Roan Mountain. At the top it was too cold and windy. Because the mountain was covered in fog or mist, there were no views after this big climb.In the afternoon things turned around. First the sun came out and it warmed up. Then I met ""Cowabunga"" and ""Jake"". Cowabunga is a twenty something male, very curly red/brown hair, wears a fedora hat, and has this big friendly smile. Jake is a collie and they make a wonderful welcoming team.Towards the end of the day I was dragging. As I arrived in Carver Gap there was trail magic. The parents of a young man who thru hiked last year had set-up a feast. They had chairs set-up, pop and beer, on the grill Italian sausage, homemade potato salad, fresh vegetables and fruit, and some wonderful rice crisp treats. I had some of everything with a cold coke and I took an orange for later that night. What a blessing. Thank You!Found a old orchard with a stream to camp tonight.","Campsite

It was a damp, drizzly morning with climbs over both Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain. It was very damp and the wind was blowing so it took a little of the fun out of the climbs. Because I have not been able to get a cell phone signal I tried calling Sue when I was on top of Hump Mountain. I wanted her to know I was okay and I need some information on a resupply shipment. The call went through and we got to talk a few minutes while I was freezing from the wind. Not sure if she believed I was okay.The second half of the day turned around and the sun came out, there was less climbing, I spent some time with Cowabonga and Jake. By the way Ekaterina your jerky is a hit with everyone that has tried it, including Jake. I also met Rice a Roni. He attempted to thru hike the last two years and realizes his body will not stand up to the punishment so he is section hiking. Also hiked about an hour with this young thru hiker from North Dakota. I have seen him on and off since the start of the the hike in Georgia. He hikes with a group of people and they do not always get along. He has decided to leave the trail at Harpers Ferry. While we were hiking there was a sign to a side trail for a waterfall. Very often thru hikers do not take side trails because we do not want to hike extra miles. Someone took the time to write a handwritten note and attach it to the sign that read, ""AT thru hikers don't miss this waterfall it is only a tenth of a mile. We went down and enjoyed the beautiful falls. I have some good pictures of it and will share them when I get the device I need.

No wonder I was feeling a little tired. Also my right knee has felt better and now my left knee is sore and swollen. Today was a good day. I stopped at a little ""private"" hostel today to pick up two packages Sue sent. One package was a resupply of food that was there and the second one was the connector I need to download pictures. He did not have that package. He said it was a long way to town so he doesn't get his mail often. I felt like asking him why he publishes he is a hostel and accept mailings, but it was a little strange so I left it go. I asked him if he would call the post office and have the packaged forward it to Damascus. He said he would and I hope so. I am getting some nice pictures I'd like to share with you. Today I got a good picture of a little mouse and later a six foot long black snake.After 17.2 miles I came to Dennis Cove Road and .4 miles down the road was a little ""resort"" on the river. I got a shower, washed my clothes, made dinner, had a couple beers, and read until 10 PM. The resort has eight cabins and a bunkhouse. They also have a little supply store. The current owners bought the place a year and a half ago. They spent six months renovating it and have been open since March 1, 2012. It is owned by a mother, father, daughter and son-in-law.

I got a slow start this morning and was not hiking until 9:30AM. It was a pleasant partly sunny day with only one big climb. Hiking along Laurel Falls and the river was magical. The water, rock formations, forest and flowers kept me engaged all morning. Just afternoon I got to Watauga Lake. In 1979 I saw my first bald eagle here. It is a big beautiful lake created by Watauga Dam. When I got to the lake there were picnic tables so I set down for lunch. Summer sausage and a peanut butter and jelly wrap. After about 10 minutes there were about 12 hikers there. It is a young group that were ""slack packing"". They pay someone to drive their backpack to a location up the trail and they carry just what they need for the day. The man who was slacking was to meet them at the park with their packs and beer and meat to grill. They asked me to stay, but I needed to move on.In moving on I had to hike over Watauga Dam. As I started over the dam a man got out of his truck and asked if I would like some trail magic. I got a great fresh apple and a Little Debbie treat. The gentlemen is from Wisconsin and started helping hikers a few weeks ago. He working as a safety person for the dam. Thank You!I have good cell phone service here on the ridge I am camped in so I have updated the last five days. Pictures to come soon. I also spoke to someone from the company I just retired from. They had their National Sales Meeting last week and pledged $5,600 to Save The Children when I complete this hike. Family members and friends have also pledged.

I was cramped alone in a nice little spot between two mountains and the wind was blowing hard. My tent was protected by the wind, but the sound from the wind, the trees creaking and the branches of the trees breaking off, kept me awake most of the night . After. 24.5 miles I thought I would be fast asleep, but no I wasn't.       I hadn't intended to hike 24.5 miles. With it being cold and the wind blowing so hard all day, you do not want to stop often or for very long. You get warm hiking and get cold very fast when you stop. The other situation that lead to a longer day was water. There was suppose to be an active spring in one of the gaps and the spring was dry. Having water hydration and cooking dinner is important, so I hiked to the next water source.         The day was certainly not all bad. Here were great views of Lake Watauga, which I had hiked around the day before. Also I met Wolf Spider a young thru hiker from Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was hiking with Red Specks and Scarecrow from Germany and Sundance. All I enjoyed getting to know. Late in the day when we were dragging, we came across some trail magic. A church group had put out a cooler full of sodas and some Little Debbie treats.

Or it could have been the anxiety of wondering if my knee would continue to hurt and be swollen. I really think it was the Dr. Pepper I drank around 8 PM. Whatever it was I heard Miss Jenny starting to prepare breakfast at 5:30 AM and fell back asleep until 6:15 AM. Then it was up and pack and have a cup of coffee. Two of the hikers were off early to slack pack. The four of us that were not slack packing had another fantastic breakfast. The other hikers left and I stayed around a while to talk with Miss Jenny. Miss Jenny was a CPA before she moved to Damascus and started the Bed and Breakfast. She has a glow about her and a kindness that is a blessing to anyone that meets her. I told her how much I missed my family and the day and a half at the Lazy Red Fox was like good medicine. I also told her I would send her a picture of me at the end of the hike if I make it. This is one place I would like to come back to.I left the Lazy Red Fox and as I headed out of town stopped at the post office. It was good being back on the trail. I ran into Sundance and Garfunkal in the first half hour. Very nice young men. Garfunkal is from Germany. I have met at least 8 hikers from Germany. Later I met for the first time Mark and Nate.

Some of the swelling was gone, and even though I still have pain, the pain was not as sharp. Plans were to get 2 miles past the second shelter, but because of the possible rain I would be flexible. The day went really good and I was hoping to get to the second shelter area before it rained. Thunder and dark clouds rolled in about 2 miles from the shelter and within 15 minutes it was raining pretty hard. What was good was that there was no wind and the temperature was about 60 degrees. When I got to the shelter it was full and there was no need to stop hiking and set-up my tent there. I continued for about 2 miles and the rain slowed down and I quickly got my tent up and my stuff inside. After about an hour it stopped raining, but it is starting again. I have eaten a double dinner of Mac and Cheese and for desert had one of the brownies my Mom sent, and for a before bed snack I am having dried pineapple that Sue dehydrated.

My wife and daughter had planned to drive me back to the spot I had left the trail a week prior. I had lightened my pack by 5 pounds and my legs and knees were feeling better and my stomach problems are gone. Before it was time to leave I decided not to return to the trail at this time.For the past 20 years I have traveled away from home almost every week. My job took me away from my family and home more time than I spent at home. This past week I have so enjoyed spending more time with my wife and family, the most important part of my life. My daughter, Ekaterina, pointed out that I have traveled so much for work, and the first thing I do when I retire is to leave home for 6 months. Having 6 weeks and 520 miles to adjust a little after retiring was good, but I really missed my family. I love the hiking and really met some wonderful thru hikers, section hikers, day hikers, trail angels, and local people. I am not done hiking the AT, I am just not sure when I will be back. Over the past few years I have gotten wonderful experiences meditating. One topic or focus of my meditation is impermanence. In this world everything is impermanent. During my journey I was very open to the messages I heard. I had the opportunity to do a little hitch hiking and was blessed with some wonderful experiences. People were very trusting and caring and I can remember each person or couple that picked me up. Two of the hitch hikes really stand out. The first was a hitch hike into Hiawassee , with John who was 68 years of age. We talked about family and John told me his wife was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and had brain surgery. He said she would never be the same and he was blessed he still had her and was making the best of each day. Then I was picked up by Bill, age 74, who drove me 27 miles to a hotel in Marion when I was sick. Bill told me his wife had a stroke a little over two years ago and even through she would never be the same he felt so blessed to still have her in his life each day. These wonderful gentlemen were bringing me a message about impermanence. I realize how our lives and the people are impermanent and I want to spend time with family right now. There is a 11 month old grandson, Taylin James, playing in my living room and I can't wait to go play with him.I want to thank everyone for your support and encouragement.
