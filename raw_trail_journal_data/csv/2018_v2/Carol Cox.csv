Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552057,Yesterday I told my department chair that I would not be returning for the 2017-18 school year. I also told several of my colleagues that I would be hiking the AT in 2018. So it's done...I've now gone public!,,Declaration of intent,"Dec 03, Sat",0
Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552224,"I've always worked out and stayed athletic enough to do what I enjoy -- hiking, trail running, yard work -- but it more interesting to work out with the thru hike in mind. Last year I started doing the stair climber at the gym with my pack on. Yes, I definitely look silly, but I was getting ready for a return trip to South Tyrol for some hiking with my family. Anyway, now I'll be conscious of slowly increasing the weight in my pack and trying to get in those daily miles. I am starting a year and a half out with a base weight of 17 pounds, which I increase to 25 (1 bag flour + 1 bag sugar) for my training hikes and although the weight seems fine, I'm sure it is the daily miles that is the more important element. I can't wait to retire (May, 2017) so I can have more time to walk!
Walk in peace,

Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552531,"I am planning to only post about once a month since it's so far out from my start date, BUT I am very happy to see a tangible shake down hike taking shape thanks to Gorp's initiative! If we're hitting the trail at 10 miles a day, I better not get too fat and happy over my Christmas break!   My students keep bringing me sweets....the struggle!  If you are a 2018'er and are interested in a week long shake down in early April, get with Gorp!Seasons greetings to all. Enjoy your walks!Carol",,Shakedown is shaping up,"Dec 20, Tue",0
Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553776,"I recently got a new pair of glasses, and I felt so self-conscious in them for the first couple of weeks. Now I'm used to seeing them reflected back at me by the morning mirror and I've adjusted my visual idea of myself. Well, this AT hike is pretty similar, I think. It has taken me awhile to feel comfortable with my new publicly announced wanna-be status, but with each conversation that I have with others, explaining the details of the undertaking to them, it feels increasingly right and true.Today my students in second period Calculus got me totally off track by asking me questions about the AT and making suggestions for my hike (get a carry permit, get a big knife, get mace, etc). Although I knew that they were trying to get out of some work (those pesky related rates!), it was fun to hear their comments and concerns. They were mortified by the idea of living in the same clothes for 5 months and felt certain that I needed to make room in my pack for deodorant. ""At least a toothbrush, Ms. Cox -- will you have a toothbrush?"" (Ans: Yes)For this month my training is: walk with loaded pack (about 3-5 times a week), trail run, yoga (always), and get an upper-body workout plan. I'm open to suggestions here for the upper body workout-- it doesn't come naturally to me.As always, walk in peace.Carol",,View Entry,"Jan 25, Wed",0
Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560057,"I spent my Spring Break (I teach in high school) hiking the first 93 miles of the Benton MacKaye Trail. It was an informative hike -- I learned that I'm ready to go, with only a few minor gear tweaks necessary. In the end I decided to go with a bear canister and although it does add 2.5 lbs to my pack, the convenience was really appreciated when I was tired and it was raining AND it fits perfectly in the sleeping bag compartment with my cookset. My homemade down quilt kept me warm to whatever temp sleet and snow brings (30 perhaps), but I don't think it would have kept me warm much lower than that. After the first 2 days we hiked in the 14 mile range and on day 7 (the last) we did close to 18. It felt good and I even managed to go for a five mile run the day after I got home. SO...now comes the hard part -- the wait! In the meantime I'll experiment with food and see if I can come up with some nutritious, calorie-laden, yet tasty meals. There were a couple of times on the hike when I was eating dehydrated stuff in a bag and the other hiker was cooking up bacon or tex-mex chicken. Yeah, I want to eat more like that!! I have always maintained that I would NEVER hike on a diet of Snickers and Poptarts. Turns out I was wrong! Hail to Snickers, hail to Poptarts -- easy calories just a wrapper away! If anyone has a good meal idea they are willing to share, I'd be happy to have it. My biggest fear for the AT hike is weight loss -- I can't afford any. My hip belt has no where else to go! Regards and Happy Trails to all,Carol","

Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573527,"Although I haven't posted in awhile, I have been busy with my preparations. I have just finished sewing a winter liner that has an insulated top layer and a nice poly/silk bottom layer. I'll have to wait for winter to try it out, but I'm optimistic that it will take my quilt down to about 10 degrees. I am managing to crank out some miles despite the heat and humidity that Atlanta is serving up. Currently I'm doing 7-12 miles with a 20 lb. daypack-- I have lots of hills around me, but no sustained climbs, just a constant up and down. In September I am doing the next 100 miles on the Benton MacKaye Trail and this time I'll leave the bear canister and try to hang a bag. I love the ease of the canister, but not all of its other limitations ( weight and rigid body). My current winter base weight is 18.5 lbs. Additionally, I am dehydrating food and currently plan on mail drops every couple of weeks-- this is one area that I plan to focus on over the winter when I'll have time to experiment with recipes, portion sizes, and caloric values. 
So all is still on track for me and I'll have more to share about my preparations as the departure date gets closer. It seems that 2018 is the year for February start dates, but I will try to stay patient and keep to mid-March.
Best wishes to those of you similarly planning and training, and as always... Happy Trails.

Carol Cox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580506,"After completing the first 92 miles of the Benton Mackaye last April, I have since been back twice to complete the next 100 miles. On my first foray, my hiking partner Mike and I put in at Ocoee(Thunderhead) and were blown off the trail by Irma 4 days later at Tellico in the Cherokee National forest. We came back on Sunday, Oct 29, to Tellico to get in another 75 miles, but discovered that part of the forest was closed due to a plane crash. A reroute added a full day to our hike and had us hiking through an active bear hunt. There were 55 men (lottery draw limit) and dozens of hound dogs. Since the idea is to shoot the bear after the hounds tree it, we felt pretty safe. Mike did choose to forgo his black pack cover.... We picked up two hounds on two occasions as hiking companions. They run those hounds very, very lean (starving, really) and the dogs were desperate for our food. One dug in next to my tent for a night and so I slept well with such a good guard! Fortunately he ran off the next day when he heard the rest of the pack. 
The Benton Mackaye trail is remote and sometimes difficult to discern. We bushwhacked along trail that seemed more animal path, often relied on compass and map, and met no one else. In other words--perfect! At Fontana we jumped over to the AT and met 6 SOBOs in the first half mile. It was inspiring to meet many more who were finishing their journeys in such high spirits. We spent the night stealth camping on Shuckstack. I heard a bear down by our food (I canister, Mike bags) and I lay in my tent waiting to hear it going for the bag. The next sound, however, is bear breath at my vestibule! I shouted to Mike that we had a visitor and, fortunately, that was enough to scare it away. The next morning we started early in the dark and had one bear crash by us down below the Mollies Ridge shelter. We took the Russell Field trail down to Cade's Cove, where we came out. We did meet another bear about a quarter mile from e Cove picnic area.
I came to the conclusion that my down quilt isn't adequate for below freezing temps. I use a sea to summit insulated ultralight pad, and my liner is silk on one side and fleece on the other. I had the silk under me and the cold just came up through me. I think I'll go back to my bag on my next winter shakedown.
I have been dehydrating and can get 5-6 days in the canister. I pack in bulk. Oatmeal. Walnuts and raisins. Brown sugar. Couscous. Ramen. Spaghetti sauce leather. Grated cheese. Olive oil. Lentils and veggies in hot vitaloo. Red bean and veggies in taco sauce. Tortillas. Homemade nut and seed bars. Jerky. Candy. Gatorade powder. Coffee.
My training has been a bit slack lately. I'm running or walking 6 miles almost every day, but I haven't been putting in any upper body. I feel tired and wonder if a week off might do me good. We averaged 13.5 miles on this last 5 day outing and according to Mike we did 22,000 ft of elevation change. It was a very comfortable pace that allowed us time to chill out a bit between eating and diving into the bag.
And now, the dilemma. I am moving overseas upon the completion of my hike and have decided to do only half of the AT this year. I am excited about this new adventure that our family is embarking upon and I don't want to be gone until the Fall. It is strange--I cried when I told my husband that I was not going to attempt the thru, but I don't feel sad about it. I think it was the realization that ""what I've always wanted to do"" is no longer the case. What I want is to be with my family as we move across the pond. So, I am planning now to do Springer to Harper's Ferry or vice versa. 
Today I sat at the dealership getting new airbags and reading up on the Italian Alpine Club. I'm thrilled by my upcoming AT Half Thru and I look forward to learning new trails in the Apuan Alps. A tutti, buona camminata! Happy hiking to all.
