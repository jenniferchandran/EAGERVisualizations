aquamann & sapphire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536574,"Been thinking about doing this hike for the last 8 months or so, learned about the AT while listening to AWOL's book during my work commutes. Put my 9 month notice in three months ago after a long, successful career.. ready to transition to a new life. I'm in gear research mode now and surprised there aren't more clear winners in each category. Just when I think I've found the perfect spork, I read reviews on a better one.. I'm happy that Sapphire will be joining me on this quest in spite of what's sure to be a difficult but hopefully rewarding experience... tons to do to get prepared.",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Sat",0
aquamann & sapphire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536832,"Sapphire and I have hiked many of the Oahu trails and we've always enjoyed our hikes; but our passion has been anchored to the ocean, pursuing diving and fishing activities. We've caught marlin and ahi, mahi and ono and taken the boat to neighbor islands in search of new and exciting locations and adventures and we've found both. But after living in paradise the last 50+ years for me and 15+ for sapphire it's time for new places and adventures and to experience the rest of the country. What better way to start than hiking through many of the east coast states?I've read most of the AT trail books and feel very fortunate to have a partner that wants to share the experience (and load) with me. We both plan to read Appalachian Trials to help us make it thru together.To be successful in this hike, I figure we'll need to work out and get in better shape, prepare ourselves psychologically, have really good, light gear and enjoy the experience.

I'd really be excited to get a pair of injinji liner socks Sapphire's excited today about a new addition to the family.. her new grandson.We both work, so weekends are the only time available for us to hike. We'd like to break in our new boots and get in better shape but the weathers been pretty bad lately and Sapphires ingrown toe nails have been bothering her.

Makiki Valley Loop which is a bit of a misnomer as it's actually three different trails combined.. would have been better for us and our hike had I read that before we started.. I thought it would be like the Aiea Loop where you hike in one direction until you get back to where you started.. my mistake. Sapphire was a champ and didn't complain after a couple unnecessary road walks and a detour thru yet a forth trail. We got back safe and sound, and in my book that's all that counts. I got to try out my new Gossamer Gear Mariposa that I received from Garrett & Jenna and it worked great. Sapphire purchased one on sale but returned hers because it was a tad too big.

Sapphire and I've been hiking every weekend (except when inundated by tropical storms), pretty much limiting ourselves to 5 to 6 mile hikes for now because of my toe. I had a hammer toe straightened (childhood injury) but the pin was left in and now after 3 to 4 miles the toe stings like a b....

Four more months of work, and it's going by quickly; getting all our medical stuff done.. like blood work and dental appointments.. the news that I was pre-diabetic was almost a shock..almost because I haven't been very active, a regular couch potato, so we joined a gym and have been working out during the week instead of only hiking on the weekends and we started a healthier food diet.. cutting out fast food and eating healthier.. so far so good.I found out that my toe issue is actually a ""Morton's Neuroma""(MN). The hammer toe causing blood poisoning I got as a kid built up scar tissue that presses against the nerve. Interesting in that I recently read a book about a hiker who kept feeling that his sock was bunched up in his shoe, he'd remove the shoe and his sock would be perfectly flat.. turns out that is one of the symptoms of a MN. On long hikes it can be caused by shoes with too tight of a toe box. The cortisone shot worked for about two weeks but I've decided to have an operation to remove the nerve and I should be fine. The bright side is I get to keep the toe",,Still Getting Ready,"Sep 05, Mon",0

Actually, I was beat by the time we reached the 3.5 mile mark (my average heart rate was like 150).. This trail is muddy and way overgrown with ferns and other chest high bushes; so much so that you can't see your feet in many places.. and the footpath is literally that wide--one foot.... with steep sides and hidden rocks and roots.. I lost track of all my slips and falls. sapphire, with energy reserves, saved the day and talked me down the mountain after I was ready to stop and overnight it..

I will really miss my co-workers, a great group of folks -- and I'm not just sayin' that cause they might be reading this  but I am excited about starting the hike.. and we are ready to start the hike. Confirmation coming from our successful scale of Mount Olympus (Oahu's version) yesterday.. only 2500' elevation but some pretty steep and hairy climbs. That is sapphire at the top of the photo with the red jacket. You'll have to turn your head because I couldn't swap the orientation. A total of 3100' elevation gain. We've continued to hike every weekend and workout during the week, although that fell off a bit with the holidays. We're in the process of moving to North Carolina, selling what we don't want to ship and packing up and shipping our personal items. I'll be happy when that's all done.We're feeling stronger each hike and have come along way since we started our training. Our only concern now is the cold.. no preparing for that here.. we'll just have to suck it up and make the best of it when we start the hike.",,Mount Olympus Oahu,"Jan 08, Sun",0
aquamann & sapphire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553862,"For so long our hike has been a distant vision on the horizon and now after months and months of planning the vision is solidifying into reality.We lead pretty comfortable lives and that will change drastically very soon. Physically we're much better prepared than I thought we might be but I'm still concerned about the mental aspects of the hike; especially the cold we're certain to face at the start of our hike. sapphire has been dogged in her approach to our finishing the trail. She's absolutely certain we'll complete it and I envy her confidence. It makes me wonder why I'm entertaining any doubts.. doubts that will sap my strength, both physically and mentally. We'll love the sunny days, meeting new people, seeing new sites and experiencing new things but sometimes my thoughts dwell on the days I'm sure we'll be dirty, wet, cold and hungry and I know we'll be asking ourselves why? I've written down quotes I've collected during the last year to help get me through those situations like: ""In the Marines we have a saying, ""Embrace the suck"". When you are knee deep in mud and it is pissing down your neck, you have two choices. Bitch, moan and give up which only compounds your misery or just say screw it and accept that things are as they are and keep moving. Even though you are muddy and wet, if you keep pushing then you will come out of it."" (unknown author) or ""The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.""~ Christopher McCandless ~ but I secretly wonder (not much of a secret now) if they'll be enough to keep us out there during the tough times. I guess it's my fear of failure that is speaking to me and I really need to shut out that voice as sapphire has. another quote I like by Les Brown: ""People achieved small things in life not because they aim big and failed but because they aim small and achieved it."" and “There must be a beginning of any great matter, but the continuing unto the end until it be thoroughly finished yields the true glory.” Sir Francis DrakeBoy, rereading those quotes got me in a more positive mood already  We'll be off in a month and a half and we've still got a lot of packing which I should get back to.But one last note before I go... I am amazed at how many people have told us how much they envy us and our adventure..

First night got down to 19 degrees, feet and hands were freezing cold in the morning. Took an hour of hiking to warm up. Since then hiking and camp life has been great. We've met a bunch of great people and have experienced two trail magics,.. hotdogs and beer at the first one and hot dog, chili, chips, and coke at the next. First one was sponsored by previous thru hikers and the second by a Baptist church from the area. Great treats after long and strenuous hikes. We're very much enjoying this fantastic experience, especially meeting all the other thru hikers. Hope family and friends are doing well and that Ben, Dee and the gang are selling a lot of roofing!

Shell sent us our lighter trail runners today and we'll get them Thursday in time to get hiking again Friday. Thanks to hiker Lyle, he tended sapphire's heals with Leuko tape so she had much less pain than previous few days. Tough hike again today but a nice couple from Iowa on their way back from Florida passed out apples, oranges -- I swear the best tasting orange ever, oreo's and peanut butter crackers.

We've stocked up on medical supplies from the local Rite Aid and re-provisioned at the Southern Crossroads Outdoors shop, Charyl (sounded like she pronounced it Charlie) was very helpful. Now we're googling blister treatment from the Hiawassee Library (cell service in town isn't any better than the trail) where we picked up a ""Hiker"" Library card. All the folks we've met around town have been so kind, talk about your southern hospitality - they live it here.

Now other maladies are cropping up.. my left shoulder starts aching a few miles in. Tightening the hip belt helps but does not alleviate the pain, and sapphire's left knee bothers her on downhills. I gotta tell you, this first 10 days of hiking the mountains of Georgia are no joke. All of the many hikers we've met have the same problems. We've met a bunch of nice folks on the trail and in the shelters. They come from all over: Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, many parts of the US like Ohio, Iowa, Maine, Louisiana to name a few. Camp life is relaxed. Someone invariably starts a fire to which hikers are drawn to like moths. We sit around telling stories about where we come from, what we do, what we're doing after the hike and the like, even politics and religion. It's incredible how giving everyone is with what little they have. And you get to know complete strangers better than some of your neighbors.

We had stopped to catch our breath, and as I sat I heard sapphire whispering. I couldn't make it out at first but then I began to understand her pleas for me to look back down the trail. Just as I did I saw one, then another of the deer jump out of the bush, over the trail then down the mountain a bit. We were able to watch for a few minutes before they disappeared behind the brush. Seeing the deer and the surprise trail magic at the shelter the night before made for a great time. BackCountry Trail Angel ""Bloodhound"" brought the folks at our shelter a 12 pack of 16 oz PBR beer. Best tasting beer I've had  We all had a great time that night, complete strangers but the AT bonds us into a very tight community. You'd have to hike this to understand the experience. Bloodhound says he blogs for hiking journal and that he recently was ""trolled"" because he's a trail angel. Apparently there is a tiny minority of folks out there that think he and other trail angels are ruining the trail experience by giving us poor hikers food and beverages.. that somehow we're now dependent upon them for meals. etc.. hogwash I say!

I picked it up from the Post office today, I'll be keeping it for the foreseeable future. More rain and thunderstorms forecast for this week. I gotta tell you, it sucks hiking in the rain. Everything is harder. Your 4 lb tent now weighs like 8 lbs. The mud makes your footing precarious at best and very difficult to climb or descend.

He didn't move, just stood there. We looked at each other for some time before I cleared my throat, coughed a bit and requested said bear to move on, sapphire then started clacking her trekking poles together and with that he reluctantly began to move off the trail, only to turn towards us and parallel to the trail about 10 yards away. Later, when I had a moment to analyze the situation, I think we should have backed away and gone around on the opposite side of the trail but fortunately the bear did not take umbrage to our continuing on down the trail and we were safely on our way, with only occasionally glances to our rear to make sure we weren't being followed. After hearing so much about ticks I found one attached to my arm today.

Then we crossed the Potomac River on a B&O railroad bridge and toured historic Harpers Ferry. We ate lunch at the Potomac Grill, built around 1850 and was originally a medical building we were told. It had an active spring fed cistern feature in one wall. I've never seen anything like it. We then toured Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church built in 1833 by and for Irish immigrants building the C&O canal system. We walked the old cemetery and checked out the founding fathers mansion.

The last 4 days have been the toughest on our feet by far! I've already discussed the rocks in PA ad nauseam so I'll just say that we're very happy to be in New Jersey. Hopefully the rocks will be smoother. There's only 60 some miles of the Appalachian Trail in NJ so it won't be long before we are in New York. 
I've been asked how we know we're following the Appalachian trail and not some local trail. Local trail clubs maintain sections of the AT doing various tasks like weed-eating, brush clearing and digging water-runoff channels. They also paint vertical 2"" x 6"" white ""blazes"" on trees, rocks, roads, telephone poles, etc.. to designate the path of the AT. We get nervous when we haven't seen one in awhile. Trust me, there's nothing worse than finding out the blazes you've been following steeply downhill for the last .8 mile are actually yellow :(
I've added a couple photos of the white blazes.","Wind Gap, PA

Sapphire is even-keeled and is positive no matter what the weather is like (don't get me wrong, she likes it nice out too) while I get moody and glum if it's crappy out. I wonder if it's because I've lived in Hawaii so long and the weather is usually much nicer than what we've been having. Almost every late-afternoon for a long time, the clouds will come in and either a thunderstorm pops up or it rains or it just stays gloomy. Seems like it's been like this since NC.

When we got down I mentioned to the three Yemeni ladies that we could smell their food cooking from on top of the mountain and it smelled wonderful. They called back to us as we were walking away and asked us if we'd like to have some. Unabashedly I said yes (it smelled really good!) and they kindly provided us with delicious barbecue chicken in a savory sauce. I was secretly hoping for the kabobs I saw in one of their pans but they hadn't been cooked yet and we didn't want to outstay our welcome :) We thanked them profusely and continued hiking.

The memorial waterfalls where the towers stood were impressive and the museum and memorial photos, videos, taped phone calls, fire trucks and ambulances and tons of other memorabilia from the horrific event brought back a flood of emotions. Later, we took a cab to Adrienne's Pizza on historic Stone Street where ate delicious New York style pan pizza on the street under tents. Satiated and looking for more adventure, we walked over to the Staten Island Ferry pier and took the ferry over to Staten Island and back. I got my first in-person look at the Statue of Liberty from the ferry's starboard railing. (Sapphire had been here before). I noticed a bunch of different languages being spoken all around us which brought to mind and badly paraphrased ""send us your tired, and huddled masses yearning to be free"".  We were back on Manhattan in time to shop for a dress for sapphire because she needed one for dinner that night with our very good friends from Hawaii, Rick and Shari, who just happened to be in town ( and the main reason we decided to take time off and go into the city) for a big weekend concert at Citifield.

A local outfitter about a mile down the road had most of what we needed and a local grocer had the rest. The fortunate part of this is that we have to climb 5000' Mt Lafayette next and with this delay we aren't out in the rain now. Tomorrow's forecast looks much better. We arranged with the hotel to forward the missing box to a post office in Maine.,"Lincoln NH

Most of which either drove up to the 6200' summit or caught the cog train. It was a surreal feeling knowing what we went through to get to the top when most of these others just effortlessly got there (not all though, one hiked up for her 40th birthday from Pinkham Notch- her family with her in support and other adventurous hiking lovers from one of the AMC's huts). We decided to enjoy our time up there with ice cold cokes and hot dogs that were being offered at the summit snack bar while we listened to a beautiful violin solo by an AT thru hiker looking to add to her hike fund. We happily donated a few bucks to assist. Today we're down off the mountain at Pinkham Notch and will be hiking up the sure to be difficult Wildcat Mountains, peaks A thru E tomorrow. The very popular Appalachian Mountain Club's Joe Dodd Lodge was booked to capacity so we gladly accepted a ride from a nice Boston family to North Conway for the night.

We were still beat up from the previous days hike so it was slow going getting down to US 2. We tried hitching a ride into Gorham but no luck, fortunately Papa Bean gave us the ph# of Bruce, a nice guy who provides shuttle services and he was there quickly.

We also went out to a local restaurant named J’s Restaurant for early dinner. The food and service were excellent. Afterward, we stopped by the hot tub where sapphire soaked her aching feet and I soaked mine in the nearby pool - Later, I was able to set up my lineup for the family fantasy football league using the inns wifi. I was forced to auto draft because we were hiking. Not a team I would have picked but I won the first match up so I'm not complaining. This morning we caught a shuttle from Bruce “Golden Waldo” back to the trailhead. We crossed over US2 and are no longer in the White’s. It was another strenuous hike, mostly uphill as most are leaving town, and hot. Upper 70’s and no breezes causing sapphire and me to stop repeatedly to wipe the sweat from our faces. The scenery was OK, but not as good as in the White Mountains. Worse is that the eye-bombing gnats are back :(  Good news though is we're only 4 miles from the Maine border, hurray!! Bad news is we're really close to the AT’s most difficult mile at Mahoosuc Notch. Update.. stayed at Gentian Pond Shelter, good to see Mowgli again and Papa Bean as well. Will cross into Maine soon.

We crossed into Maine at noon and ate lunch at the border with Mowgli who caught up to us minutes earlier. He ate a ton of food exclaiming “now that I'm in Maine this is my main meal, haha”. Southern Maine is living up to its reputation as some of the toughest hiking; and I use that term very loosely because there is seriously more rock climbing than trail. Funny thing tho, a NOBO walked past as we were eating dinner near our tent and greeted us with “Isn’t Maine Beautiful?” Frankly and truthfully I had been too busy going up and down to notice. But I stopped and thought,  “sure is” was my reply. I guess you have to look past your own troubles to see the beauty. I don't think we'll be noticing it again tomorrow as it looks to be an even tougher day. We are a tad apprehensive about tomorrow's ""hike"". We should be in for our most difficult day.

aquamann & sapphire,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577860,"I was too tired to write yesterday. Without a doubt the most difficult, strenuous, and at times rewarding day of the six months we've been hiking the Appalachian Trail. In fact the last three days have been especially tough. I guess Maine wants to make an impression early. The views, when we have a moment to catch our breath and slow our heart rates down, are some of the nicest yet. We can still see Mt's Washington and Madison way off in the distance. We did Mahoosuc Notch in two hours, not bad for a couple older folks. Sapphire wasn't loving it so much but I surprisingly kind of enjoyed the challenge. We crossed paths with a group of SOBO's half way through and we overheard one of them obviously not enjoying her experience exclaim ""this is a cluster f..k!!""
This explanation of Mahoosuc Notch is taken from Wikipedia: 
The boulders on this mile-long section of trail present obstacles that must be climbed over and sometimes under, creating a unique hiking experience. There are occasional 10-foot (3.0 m) drops, and places where packs must be removed to squeeze beneath a boulder.
Many hikers call this stretch one of the slowest on the 2,179-mile (3,507 km) trail. This so-called ""killer mile"" or the ""Toughest Mile""[1] is a very tough section that can cause even the most experienced hikers to slow down.
Immediately after getting through the notch we had to climb Mahoosuc Arm, a very steep and tall ascent, followed by climbs up a couple other peaks and finally up Old Speck, Maine's third highest peak. The highlight of the day was visiting Speck Pond, an alpine lake full of native trout, where a local family was up for the day fishing and enjoying the day. (They accessed it from a different location). The kind ladies graciously offered us one of their husbands' sandwich, chips and cookies. He yelled over good naturedly from the other bank ""are you giving away all our food?"" Needless to say we enjoyed the food and were soon back on the trail. At the bottom, an area called Grafton Notch, we enjoyed more trail magic of Duncan Donuts and Gatoraid while waiting for our shuttle ride. Thank you Doug and lovely wife! We're taking the day off to let our old bones (speaking for aquamann only) rest and recuperate. PS I added more photos.","Full Goose Shelter

The hikes have been tough but are getting a bit less strenuous each day since Mahoosuc Notch, just a tiny bit. Maine doesn't want us thinking they've gotten soft; which is good because Sapphire and I have been trying to get over our colds. Fall is actively in progress, red, amber, and umber leaves cover the ground in an autumn colored carpet, in many areas obscuring the trail. We'll be hiking into Rangeley tomorrow to pick up our last resupply box before we tackle the 100 mile wilderness which begins in Monson. The 100 mile wilderness is an area in Maine far from civilization which ends at Baxter State Park where our ultimate goal Mt Katahdin resides. We're on track to climb Mt Katahdin on October 10th. We'll probably get there a day or so early but will wait for my brother to show up before we climb. We are getting anxious and are very ready for this very fine and very long adventure to come to a very rewarding completion soon. Update, we're in Rangeley now and we heard our first moose call during our hike today. It was pretty close but we couldn't see it through the bush. I wanted to call back but that idea was vetoed by Sapphire, afraid it might get too close. Next time you hear from us will probably be when we get into Monson on the 26th or so. Hopefully they have wifi at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel.","

The days are growing shorter quickly and we've been graced with fantastic (if not a bit too hot) weather during our time in Maine. And it looks like it will last (and get cooler thank goodness) for the next week or so. Today we crossed the Kennebec river via the AT's canoe service. It's the only place on the AT where you officially travel by water. Pretty cool, and sapphire's first canoe ride! We're staying at the Caratunk House B&B tonight. We happily washed the trail off and enjoyed sodas, fruit cups and a slim jim. Later, Paul, the proprietor, gave us a ride to a local pub where we enjoyed beer and pub fare and I got to watch most of The Princess Bride. Life's simple pleasures and ones we are looking forward to enjoying more of soon. Most of the really difficult terrain is behind us so tomorrow shouldn't be too bad. We'll be in Monson in three days and then we'll begin the 100 mile wilderness. We're getting real close!!!

It was an idyllic setting, one only received after hiking miles into the wilderness. It made us realize that while we are very ready to complete this adventure we will certainly miss aspects of being on the trail. And with only a few (11) days remaining, gives us the ability to appreciate the beauty, not just the hardships. We only had 9 miles to hike into Monson and the quality of the morning sunshine was perfect; no haze, crisp and clear. The temperature dropped overnight (thank god because the last two days were so hot!) and it brought perfect hiking weather which brought joy to my heart. We hitched a ride into town and had a delicious lunch at a very homey pub. We're now at the famous Shaw's Hostel, the gateway to the 100 mile wilderness. We're taking the day off tomorrow to rest up and resupply before tackling it. This may be our last post until we summit on the 10th. Wish us luck!

I was happy that our thoughts weren't just about finishing and we were able to appreciate the trail and the beauty of Maine in October. For any of you reading this that haven't seen Maine in Autumn splendor you really owe it to yourselves to get up here. We summited today in fierce winds that thankfully relented and gave way to a beautiful sunny Maine day. It took us almost 4 hours to reach Baxter Peak and we quietly celebrated with other NOBO’s - Atlas and Lotus, Mishap and Dirty Duck, Steelhead, and a few others. Our emotions ran the gamut: elation, relief, excitement, apprehension(building the new house), but mostly relief. Nearly 7 months on the trail have taken a toll on our bodies so we look forward to a little R&R with my brother Chris and sister Cher who flew all the way from Hawaii to greet us at the bottom. We'll be taking a road trip south to Portland for a celebratory Lobster dinner, Boston, to hoist a brew in honor of JJ who was a huge Red Sox fan, RI, NYC, and Washington DC before staying with daughter Bell until we move to North Carolina in November.

After sister Cher and brother Chris drove us ""home"" on an epic road trip where we took in Mystic Seaport, a few of the largest eastern seafood distributors, Old Boston, and finally Washington D.C., we ended at daughter Bell's home in Quantico. We rested and recuperated and got our Ford Five Hundred road worthy. Then we were down to coastal North Carolina looking for our few acres to build on. We didn't find anything we had to have in the week we were down there so we headed north to finish what we started, namely the AT. Sapphire and I were both excited to get hiking again which was somewhat surprising as we were very ready to complete it earlier. We overnighted in Waynesboro and then drove up early in the morning and parked at the campground. It was very cold when we started our hike, 19 degrees, and it never really warmed up during the 4+ hours it took us to finish the section we missed months earlier. We were bundled up in a bunch of layers: merino wool NTS long john's, two shirts and Patagonia R1 fleece and wool caps that kept us warm. It felt great being out in the woods again, free from any concerns but our footing. We flew for the first four miles averaging well over three miles an hour... much quicker than we used to. Slackpacking and the cold helped with our speed and so did the month-long rest. The ground was frozen in quote a few spots so it would crunch under our shoes and the fallen leaves all but obscured the path. We didn't see much wildlife, a doe, a grouse and quite a few crows. I guess the rest of the animals were safely tucked away somewhere trying to stay warm. We saw quite a few day hikers out but no southbound AT hikers, I guess they're past here by now. We finished out hike just before 1:30pm and proceeded to hitch hike back to our car. We were picked up by the third car past, Dennis and his wife Julie. We rode in the back seat with their dog Hap, a young, sweet german shepherd who had just finished his first hike. We kept each other warm on the ride back. Dennis was apparently enjoying our conversation so much he forgot the speed limit. The ranger that pulled us over wanted to remind him of that but on noticing Dennis was a veteran on Veterans Day let us off with a warning. We all cheered..
