SQUIRREL!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554918,"I begin this thing exactly 2 months from today. Tonight...it got real. It wasn't real when I started thinking about it a few years ago; it wasn't real when I started planning it a year ago; it wasn't even real when I made my leave of absence from work official last Friday. It became real tonight: I am thru-hiking the AT. I'm thru-hiking the AT! I'm thru-hiking the AT?? Call it a series of events--both unfortunate and welcomed--but no matter the occurrence, it's happening, and it's approaching faster than a freight train. At times I feel super-human, like I could just jump aboard and ride it to the finish, whoopin' and hollerin' the entirety of the trek. And the next practice hike out, (or the next day...or minute), I feel tied to the tracks, wide-eyed terror at the oncoming slaughter, no Superman racing to my rescue. My mind, as varied as it is, can't keep pace: ""I'm ready! Bring it on!"" vs. ""I am so not ready; what the hell am I doing?"" ...and, ""I'm totally over-thinking this thing."" vs. ""I'm not thinking this thing through; I'm not thinking AT ALL!"" Whatever... Right now, there's no thinking about it. It's real. I'm thru-hiking the AT.",,Katahdin,"Feb 20, Mon",0
SQUIRREL!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554984,"The instructors at the last few AT classes at my friendly neighborhood REI featured an AT book with which I was not familiar: a green, horizontal number, a bit bigger than a postcard. I am tied to my ragged ""Appalachian Trail Thru-Hikers' Companion"", but it's the 2015 edition, meaning it was published in autumn 2014. Yeah, a bit dated. BUT I LOVE MY COMPANION! So out to the book shelves my dear friend and I go, but we see only these new, green interlopers! No updates to the Companion. What a guy: he orders it right then and there for me, and today, TODAY! It arrived! And WHOO HOO! Bonus! I also received my Leave No Trace membership card and cool car window sticker. It's like Christmas!",,THEE Book (and a bonus),"Feb 21, Tue",0
SQUIRREL!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555026,"One night is a deep breath. Two nights is an extra glass of wine. Multiple nights that string together and twist into a tangled knot--there's not enough deep breathing or wine. It makes me want to tap out. Unforeseen medical bills. Taxes. Work that I shouldn't leave. Going to NY to comfort a daughter. Going to Ohio to comfort a sister and brother. Is this all taking me from the trail or driving me to it?? So before I concede the fight, I'll step back. First, think: Is this really a push-and-pull to or from the trail? The trail is nothing more than a weather-beaten, physical, man-made path. No, this is a trial. Yes, t-r-i-a-l. And I'll look upon it as a precursor to trail trials: formidable peaks; high, fast waters; thick, sucking mud; torrential rains; blistering heat; hunger; cold; loneliness. But I know there's a beautiful, lush valley just ahead. I'll have level ground; deep, enticing swimmin' holes; soft, warm breezes. I'll kick off my boots and strip to nakedness. I'll laugh with new friends under clear, star-lit nights. And I'll look my trial in the eye: ""Suck it! I am NOT tappin' out!""",,Tappin' Out...,"Feb 22, Wed",0
SQUIRREL!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555296,"It's the kind that cuts to the core of my stomach that, when it hits hardest, emanates up through my chest and stabs direct center of my heart: it's the pit of saying, ""See you 6 months”—truly “the pits"". Unlike the sweet center of a run-down-the-chin, juicy peach that I can suck with satisfaction for another good 15 minutes, this pit just plain sucks. It's the center of anxiety, fear, and sadness; it's bitter and coarse, and I can't get the taste out of my mouth. There is no comfort in thinking my children—all grown adults—will be fine. There’s no lying to myself that my family won’t worry about me. And there’s absolutely no guarantee that current relationships await me at the top of Katahdin, just as strong as the mountain itself. I feel that pit—that intangible punch in the gut—and I lose my appetite for food and gain only sleepless nights. Then, as God-given gravity would have it, the pendulum swings. Anxiety becomes adrenaline; fear becomes fight; sadness becomes strength. I’ll pray my kids are fine while I’m gone, but for the next 6 months, I’ll demonstrate to them a commitment to passion. I’ll plan my trip down to the mile for my family, but for the next 6 months, I’ll exemplify for them “Life’s too short! Seize the day!” I’ll hope for the comfort and security of excitement rekindled, but for the next 6 months, I’ll embrace the mystery and face the unknown. “See you in 6 months”—yeah, a hard bitter pit, but sweetened with each swing of the pendulum.",,The Pit and the Pendulum,"Feb 28, Tue",0
SQUIRREL!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555429,"It's all in my face: dog-eared trail books; my journal; growing to-do lists (including random things I text to myself); a 2017 monthly/weekly planner (more often another to-do list); TrailJournals, WhiteBlaze, Amazon, LNT, ALDHA, and ATC websites; how-to YouTube videos; gear instructions; a budget spreadsheet; and an as-yet blank mini-moleskine notebook. I found the moleskine in a box of door prizes and thought, ""Ooh! I need this!"" No, I do not. But there it sits--staring at me, wanting my pen, making me feel guilty that I should at least jot SOMETHING in it. A few months ago one of my friendly neighborhood REI instructors/guides said, ""Barb, you're starting to overthink this. I don’t want to see you again for at least another month!"" Of course she was kidding. (Thankfully she wasn't working last Sunday. Or the Thursday before. Or the Tuesday of the same week.) I'm about 2 months out, and I find myself wishing for one of those Staples buzz buttons: “Don’t stress it! Press it! ‘That was EASY!’” Ah! I should take this thing along and let it repeatedly echo through the gaps and down into the valleys with every peak I conquer!! Well, wait. I promised Mom and Dad I’d try to make friends. Better leave it. “That was EASY!”",,Don't stress it! Press it!,"Mar 01, Wed",0
