Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552361,"So, I have decided to attempt a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail in 2017. It's something that has been in the back of my mind since I was a kid growing up in Roanoke, Virginia. The first time I was on the AT, I didn’t realize it was the AT. I drove 15 minutes from my house to hike up to the top of McAfee’s Knob and wondered why there was this white strip of paint on the tress every so often. Found out it was part of a trail that went from GA to ME and people hiked the whole thing. Couldn’t believe it. The next hike I did was Dragon’s Tooth, and there were the same white blazes on the tree. The hikes were great and I was very intrigued as to what other sights the trail had. I did a bit more hiking through out college when I had time but nothing too big. I graduated from NC State with a degree in Meteorology but decided not to pursue it as a career. I moved back to Roanoke and I started playing music for a living. It was fun and exciting and met lots of wonderful people, but most of them were the outdoors type.   So, I didn’t hike really at all for years. Then in 2007 I decided to move to Portland, OR to further my music career. Everyone I met here was into doing anything and everything that evolved being outside. It was great! I started going on hikes in around Mt Hood and was just mesmerized. My playing schedule was hectic but I tried to be outside as much as I could. All of my vacations were spent in the National Parks in the west. Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Ranier, Olympic, Bryce Canyon, Zion.   They were all amazing, and beautiful!In late 2015, things started to change with my career and living situation. My girlfriend and I split up and she kept the house and I rented a room in a basement from a friend. With the cost of living skyrocketing in Portland, I quickly realized wasn’t able to support myself by just playing music anymore. I ended up having to get a job working in a factory Tue-Thur and every other Monday 5:30pm-5:30am, and then play music Fri-Sun. I get 2 days off a month, and to escape the craziness of my life and schedule, I have been hiking. I started to find so much peace and so much of myself again in nature. It’s been very therapeutic and is what has helped me get through a tough time.    I had been saving up money to try and rent an apartment, but started to think better of it. Why would I spend all my money on an apartment when I work 80-90 hours a week, part of it at a job I don’t really like (although the people are great), just so I can try and have a place I’ll never see. Combine that with the fact that I have given up on the career side of my music, and I realized that I have nothing that is really tying me down at the moment. No lease, no relationship, no kids, no career. I started to contemplate about things I’d like to do if I had the time and opportunity. And what I kept coming back to was being outside and hiking.   I had saved up some money that I was saving for an apartment, so everything was lining up. I should hike. But where?Most would think I’d want to do the PCT…and I would like to. But something about the AT keeps calling me. Part of it is that I will be closer to my family and my mom is getting older. And I need to spend a little time with her before my hike since I’ve been away from home for 10 years. Another part is that I grew up with the AT around me, it seems to be in my blood a little bit.So, I made the decision to hike the AT in 2017. I must admit I am nervous, but excited.   I’m looking forward to the challenge and adventure, and to pushing through some of my fears.",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Sat",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552417,"A couple of weeks ago I had a Friday afternoon off and decided to get up early for a hike. Since I get off work at 5:30am on Friday morning, getting up at 9am is a little bit of a stretch but it was my only window I had for a hike that week. I drove 45 minutes from Portland and started off at Multnomah Falls around 10:45am. Since it gets dark here at 4:30pm, I knew I wouldn't have a long hiking day so I just started hiking and decided I'd turn around at 1:45pm. Ended up making it up to the top of Larch Mountain by my turnaround time. 4100' of elevation gain in 6.9 miles in about 3 hours so not too bad. Was about a foot of snow on the top, and was really happy with the way my Nike Wildhorse 3 GTX trailrunners handled the wet/muddy/snowy conditions on the trail. Put in about 14 miles in 5.5 hours, and made it back just before dark.   Pretty good day.",,"Larch Mountain, OR ","Dec 13, Tue",13.80
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552418,"Today I took a little hike up to Cape Horn on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. Was rainy and chilly with temps in the upper 30's, and about 4-5"" of snow still left on the ground from last weeks storm. It's not a real big hike, about 1000' elev gain and 5.5 miles roundtrip. Was mainly testing out some more shoe options. This time I had some Dexshell waterproof socks with my Nike Terra Kiger 3 trail runners. The socks kept my feet dry, which I was kinda surprised by, but my toes did get a little chilly by the end of my hike. The trail runners handled the snow pretty well, and am feeling more and more comfortable with taking some version of them to start my AT hike. Next hike I'm going to try the Nike Wildhorse 3's with the waterproof socks and add a wool sock underneath and see if that helps keeps my toes a little warmer.",,"Cape Horn, WA ","Dec 13, Tue",5.50
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552842,"A couple of weeks ago it was snowing a bit in Portland and wanted to try out my trail runners and new crampons in the snow. Headed to the Coast Ramge to hike Saddle Mountain and it was a great hike. 6 miles out and back, 2400' elev gain, 25 degrees, and about a foot of snow and still coming down. Completed it in about 2 1/2 hours and was really happy with the crampons and the shoes. My last day of work is Thursday and I hope to be able to get a couple of two and three day trips in. It's been cold and snowy here in the PNW and have a feeling I'll be using the crampons quite a bit.",,Saddle Mountain Hike,"Jan 02, Mon",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553613,"I went for a little hike today along the Clackamas River, about an hour SE of Portland.   It's been extremely snowy/icy here, which is rather unusual, and this is one of the only somewhat challenging hikes I could think of that wasn't buried in 4-5 feet of snow. It was about 8 miles total and still had quite a bit of ice and snow on the trail. I ended up having to wear my microspikes the whole time. I took along my new Zpacks Arc Haul and filled it with gear that I'll be taking on the AT just to get some good training in. Had 2L of water and about 5 days of food and weighed in at about 29lbs. It has taken a little bit of time to get everything adjusted on the pack but so far I like it.It was about 35-40 degrees on the trail and raining off and on and just decided to throw on all the rain gear and gaiters from the beginning. Stayed nice and dry and the Nike Wildhorse GTX felt good again today even with the microspikes on. It's been difficult finding time in my schedule to go out for a few days as I am still playing music at nights until I leave. But I'm hoping to get a few longer hikes in next week, if I can find some places that don't have a ton of snow.",,Clackmas River - Pup Creek Falls,"Jan 21, Sat",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553783,"I went out for another little training hike on Monday, and decided to go up to the PCT and see what the conditions were in the Columbia Gorge after the recent storms. Well, conditions weren't so good. With 2-3' of snow falling there and about 1.5"" of ice on top of that, the trail was a disaster. Fallen trees everywhere...it looked like tornado had hit. I managed to climb my way over 5 miles of it, but decided to turn back shortly after Dry Creek Falls. Was good to get out and about though and the weather was pretty nice, about 35 and sunny. In the picture I took, I am standing on the actual trail.",,PCT day hike,"Jan 25, Wed",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553784,"Decided to try my luck near Mt Hood yesterday and was so glad I did. Went to Tamawanas Falls, and finally found a winter trail that was good and snowpacked. Since it was a lot higher in elevation (3500'), it escaped the ice storm and just got snow. There was about 3-4'of snow, and it was absolutely amazing. Since it had been packed down, I didn't need snowshoes only needed to bring my microspikes and trail runners. One of the most beautiful hikes I've ever done. I took my full backpack along, my Zpacks Arc Haul, and I'm getting the adjustments more and more dialed in.",,Tamanawas Falls,"Jan 25, Wed",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554513,"This week, I've been spending lots of time hiking Forest Park here in Portland, OR. With over 70 miles of trails and some sections of trail that have an elevation gain of 800'/mile, it's proven to be a good training alternative to the Columbia Gorge which has been buried in 3-4' of snow. I've been hiking with my full pack on, and have gotten lots of strange looks from other people on the trails thinking I'm homeless and living in the park...too funny. Some of the long distance trail runners know whats up and ask what I'm training for.   I put in 50 miles in the last 4 days, in all kinds of weather. Snow, cold driving rain, a little sun. Feeling pretty good about the way my pack feels on me when full. I wore the Nike Wildhorse 3 GTX the first two days with gaiters and they ended up getting soaked through in the rain anyway (we got 2-3"" of rain those days...which is typical here this time of year).   Tried out the non-Gortex version the next two days and thinking I'm just going to go with those. I can tell my feet are just going to get too hot and sweaty, and I'll bring along some waterproof socks for heavy rain days if needed.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Sun",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556262,"It's been a while since I posted a journal entry because things have been so crazy busy this last month. I made the trip from Portland, OR to where my mom lives in Virginia Beach the first week of March. The two weeks preceding that, I was overwhelmed with saying goodbye to friends and playing my last round of shows and goodbye parties with my band. It made me realize just how blessed I am to have to many friends who care about me and who are there for me in my journeys. The shows were great, but a bit emotional as it was the last time I'll play music at that level for a while, and may be the last time I play a guitar for a while as well since I won't be bringing one on the trail. Was really difficult letting go of my career that I've worked so hard for the last 20 years, but I knew the timing was right, and other adventures are calling for the time being. The trip across the country was great, and took my time, making it to VA from OR in 8 days. I was able to see lots of friends along the way as I took the southern route, and stopped in Reno, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Austin, Jackson, Nashville, and Raleigh. When I was crossing over the AT on I-40 along the TN/NC border, I got out and hiked for about 5 miles with my pack to stretch my legs. Was great to get on the trail and see those white blazes, it had been a while. I did have a scary incident at the trail head when I came back as a local was waiting for me in the parking lot. He noticed my Oregon plates and wanted to pick a fight. He was really drunk and pretty wound up, and I thought I was in trouble for sure. But I was able to convince him I really was from the mountains of Virginia and just lived in Oregon for a few years. After about 15 minutes of tense conversation he let me go. I'm thankful my accent had already started to come back a bit. I know this isn't typical, but I know I still always have to be on my toes. Having lived in Roanoke most of my life, I ran across guys like that from time to time up in the hills. My start day is March 23, 10 days away. I've been making little gear adjustments here and there, and trying to stay in shape and put on a few extra pounds of body weight as well. I did a final shakedown trip of my gear last Friday along the AT just south of Rockfish Gap here in VA. It got down into the upper teens with winds blowing 30-40 mph. Felt pretty good about my gear. Decided to leave the Ursack at home due to its weight and practiced throwing a bear bag using the PCT method and am comfortable with that now. The only thing that is a bit concerning is that my left knee and hip are a bit sore, which really hasn't happened before. It may be because I was in the van driving 4000 miles the last week or so and it's funky from that. Hoping it's my IT band, and am doing some exercises and stretches to try and help it out. Keeping my fingers crossed there. Hope to be able to update the journal a bit more regularly from here on out as the craziness from the move has subsided a bit.",,10 days away,"Mar 13, Mon",0
Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557030,"After months of planning and preparation, I leave for Georgia on Wednesday. So many thoughts and emotions going through my mind...excitement, anxiety, curiosity, fear. The more I think about it, I think the single biggest reason for me to try and hike the AT is to conquer my fear. Fear of wild animals, being alone in the woods, getting hurt, heights, freezing to death, starving to death, lightning, ticks, poison ivy, hitchhiking, crazy people, forgetting how to play guitar, all my friends forgetting about me. Most of it is kind of silly, but I know I do have some fear and I have to be aware of it. I consider myself a fairly predictable kind of guy, but I know the greatest accomplishments in my life have come when I have pushed through my fear. So, that's what I intend to do...just keep pushing forward and put one foot in front of the other and see how far I get.Still making last minute adjustments to gear. I've got my pack weight at 34lbs with 4 days of food and 2 liters of water. Deciding to leave the solar charger (Goal Zero Nomad 7 plus) at home as it's somewhat unreliable even in the sun at home. I going to just bring along a single charge battery and see how that goes for a while. And besides I have AT&T for service and from what I hear the coverage is pretty poor along the trail. I tried to switch to Verizon this morning but since I have a new phone it's not compatible with their service. I'd like to drop a couple more pounds from my pack now, but I'm sure something will shake out in the first week or two. I put everything in the Osprey Aether 70 just out of curiosity and the Zpacks still seems more comfortable to me, even at that weight. The hardest part of the last 3 weeks has been that I've been out of my training routine. It's been nice to see my family in VA Beach, but between that and the drive across country I've been sitting around way too much. When I was still in Oregon I was hiking 50-75 miles a week with my pack in horrible weather along the PCT. I felt great and really prepared.   It's just so flat here it's almost like why bother. But I know after a week or two on the trail I'll start to get my legs back. And speaking of legs, my left knee still has a bit of pain. I still think it has to do with me sitting in the van in basically the same position for 8 days and 4000 miles. Keeping my fingers crossed and praying it will work itself out.",,Almost time,"Mar 20, Mon",0

Driving down to Amicalola in the morning from my mom's in Virginia Beach at 7am and hope to be there around 5pm.   Have a room booked at the lodge and looking forward to getting things started.

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557454,"Interesting first day, filled with lots of ups and downs. Woke up at the lodge around 7 and then headed down and checked in at the visitors center at 8:30am and I am hiker 1129. That, is a lot. And my pack weighs 36 lbs, and that also is a lot. I really need to get my pack weight down under 30. I saw 3 others with the Zpacks Arc Haul and their weights were on the 24-28 lb range. Had my brother drop me off at the parking lot near the lodge to start. Was kinda surreal leaving him and starting on this adventure. Made some good time up the trail towards Springer and make it there around 12:30. Beautiful sunny weather with temps around 50 although a little breeze made it feel about cooler. Somewhere about a mile or so out from Springer, my left hip and knee really started to bother me. Not sure what it could be but already has me very concerned cause it really hurts. I'm hoping that I just need to get used to everything and it calms down. I decided to stop at Stover Creek shelter, putting my miles for the day at 10.3. Not bad, but know I need to take it slow in the beginning, especially with my hip and knee hurting. May try and make Devils Kitchen tomorrow 11.6 miles away, depending on how I feel.So, got to the shelter and was setting up my tent and I hear ""snap"". One of the tent poles snapped, the one right at the top in the middle. Not good. Luckily I had an emergency splint in my tent bag. After about an hour of trying to figure out the best way to get it on, I managed to take the frame apart and got it on and duct taped it. It seems to be holding ok for the time being. I'm going to see if I can get my brother to send me my other tent up ahead a few days. The weather is good today and tomorrow, but we are expecting heavy rains for Saturday and Sunday.

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557535,"March 24Tent held up ok last night with splint. Got a decent nights sleep but left knee and hip were really hurting all through the night. Had no idea if I'd be able to hike at all today but after some oatmeal set off up the trail from Stover Creek at 8:45am. Hip and knee felt like they were loosing up for most of the day which made me feel a little better. Ended up doing 13 miles today and the last couple miles down from Justus Mtn I got a quick sharp pain in my knee that scared the crap out of me. It didn't happen again but I could tell it was weak and had some dull pain associated with it. Worried about it but there is not much I can do about it out here except try and take it slow.   Made it too Gooch Mtn shelter and it is packed. Luckily got one of the last tent areas around 4pm. There are sooooo many people hiking the trail this year, it's crazy. I'm going to try and take it slow tomorrow and only hike 9 miles. And then the Sunday maybe aim for Neel Gap and stay at Mountain Crossings.Meeting some really cool people so far and even ran across a SOBO today, on his last day. His name was Happy Pants and he started in Maine in Sept and hiked through the Winter. Cool guy and he definitely had some stories to tell. Going to try and get some sleep and get up early to make it to Lance Creek early in the day so as to get a tent space. The weather has been great but looks like some big storms are coming tomorrow night and Sunday. Hope the tent holds up.","Stover Creek Shelter

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557608,"March 25So, another interesting day. Last night I had my camp shoes on and stepped on a rock or branch and really messed something up on my foot. Felt like a bone was out of place. Was painful to walk on but hoped some sleep would help. Was at Gooch Mtn Shelter last night and it was packed! Got there at 4pm and got one of the last tent spots. There were 32 people staying at the shelter. Just crazy! Woke up this morning and it was super painful. Decided to try it as long as I could and maybe make it to Jarrard Gap 10 miles away. It was some of the most excruciating pain I've ever experienced and didn't have much of a choice except to push through it. Was super lucky to get trial magic 3 times today! At trail crossings with roads 3 different times there was food. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Amazing! All of it was by outreach ministries I think by churches and I couldn't be more grateful. Food was one thing I didn't have to worry about today. I managed to get to Jarrard Gap and I had gotten some wrong info from a trail runner at Gooch Mtn. He said I didn't need a bear canister there and when I got there, there were signs everywhere that said they were required to camp there. So I had 3 choices. Camp there any way. Hike 2.5 miles back in horrible pain to the last campsite before the restriction. Or push on another 5 miles up and over Blood Mtn. to Neel Gap. And of course I chose the crazy option. Push on another 5 miles. I took a couple Advil and went for it. And it felt like it was loosening up a little bit and by some miracle I made it the 5 miles to Neel Gap. 16 miles today. The hostel here was full so I'm camped around back. Big storms coming tonight and hope I can stay dry and get a bunk tomorrow and take a zero day.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557703,"March 26Started raining pretty hard last night around 2am. I stayed warm and fairly dry in my tent, but everything got super muddy in the storm. Got up about 7:30 and headed down the hostel office and was able to get a bunk for tonight. Foot is still hurting a lot and have been contemplating on what to do. I've been trying to RICE it most of the day and it seems like it's getting a little better. But realized after taking a shower (which was awesome) that it pretty bruised on the side. Debating what to do. If it still feels this bad in the morning I will hitchhike into Blairsville to see if I can get an X-ray. Mountain Crossings Hostel has been pretty cool, and the people staying here are amazing. I've only been on the trail 4 days and it already feels like a family. Everyone has been super helpful and supportive and lots of fun to talk to. And it seems like my trail name Tornado is going to stick.Something hit me yesterday as I was hiking. This is the first time I have backpacked two night in a row, ever. I have hiked a lot and did little one night trips here and there before I left. I'm proud of myself, at least for that...It's the little things.I'm going to go and try and get some sleep. Only slept in a hostel one time before and that was in Russia. This is a whole different experience. 14 people in a bunk room. Glad I have my earplugs.","

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557831,"March 27I slept ok at the hostel last night. Quilt is too warm for inside so was sweating a bit. Lots of snoring of course, even through the ear plugs. Woke up about 6:45am and chatting with my friends for a bit and everyone was pretty concerned about my foot. Most of them told me to be overly cautious and go get it checked out. I packed my pack up and walked a little up the trail to test my foot and it still hurt quite a bit. I called a couple clinics in Blairsville and neither had X-ray capabilities so the ER was the only option. I waited in the hostel parking lot for a few minutes and found a family that was dropping off their sons hiking and asked them if they could give me a ride and they did. Super grateful to them! Got to the hospital and checked in and saw the Doctor. Took a few X-rays and said nothing looked broken. Said it was most likely a sprained or torn ligament. No way to tell without and MRI, and that could take a couple weeks to schedule. And it really didn't matter since the line of treatment is the same. Stay off it till it doesn't hurt anymore. He recommended one week with crutches then try putting weight on it and see if still hurts. If it still hurts after 3 weeks I should see about an MRI. Not good news at all. I decided to get a room in town for the night and weigh my options. Walked to the nearest hotel with my gear about a mile away. Foot didn't hurt as bad as it did earlier, but still hurts. I talked to some friends and weighed my options. I have a friend from high school who lives in Atlanta who offered to come and get me and let me stay with her family for a few days. So, she'll pick me up in Blairsville tomorrow morning and I'll rest in Atlanta til Friday and see how my foot feels. If it feels a lot better, she'll take me back up to Neel Gap to resume my hike. If not, I'll see about going to Roanoke, VA and stay with friends there for a couple weeks and try to recoup fully. If I do, then I may head back to Neel Gap, or I may start a flip flop hike from there. I'm going to try and do my best to be patient and heal, but I'm determined not to let this end my hike.","Mountain Crossings

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557967,"March 28Big storms last night in N Georgia. Watched them from the parking lot of my hotel in Blairsville...was amazing and powerful. I realized that it was the first thunderstorm I had seen in over 10 years. Just crazy. Portland doesn't get thunderstorms. I've seen 6 random lighting strikes in 10 years if that says anything. Growing up in VA it was an almost everyday occurrence in the summer. And of course by having a degree in Meteorology I've always been fascinated by them. But couldn't help but think about being out on the trail during a storm and how terrifying that can be. I know all the right things to do - drop pack and poles, stay off exposed ridges, find low ground or a ditch, stay away from water and lone trees, if you're in trees find shorter groups among tall tees of fairly uniform height, if your around people stay 50 feet away from each other, if you are in open ground don't lay on the ground but squat down tuck head between your knees and cover your ears and head with your arms. But knowledge still won't help being terrified. Slept pretty good and had my friend pick me up from Atlanta around 11 and she took me to REI. The took my tent back, no problem at all. Just amazing. Some people can look down on them but today is exactly why I bought the majority (but not all) of my gear from them. I ended up getting the Nemo Hornet 2 and footprint. Also picked up an OR Helium 2 rain jacket. With the return and my dividend, they ended up giving me $3 back. And I dropped about 24 oz off my pack. Very happy. I'm hanging out at my friends house outside of Atlanta with her family and have my foot up with ice on it. Very grateful for them to have a place to rest up! I'll see how the foot feels and will make a decision on what to do next on Thursday night. Either head back to the trail this weekend, or head up to Roanoke and take another 2 weeks off.","Blairsville, GA

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559397,"April 9I've been in Roanoke a week now and my foot is finally starting to feel ok. I did a little test hike yesterday up Read Mountain with my full pack, about 6 miles, and the foot was ok. The rest of my body was a bit sore from being basically sedentary the last couple of weeks, my left knee and hip in particular. I'm hoping that once I start hiking it'll work itself out. I do have a few logistical things to take care before I start hiking. I decided to go ahead and do a flip flop from Roanoke and go north from Rt. 311, and then finish the southern part in the late summer/fall. I'll have more time to finish if I need to, and I will be closer to friends here in VA in case I need to come off the trail again and heal more. So, tomorrow, I will hike starting at Rt 311, hike over McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, and over to Lambert Meadows. Then on Tuesday I'll hike to Daleville and spend the night at a friends and do a little reassessment of my foot/knee/hip. Wednesday I'll drive to VA Beach and leave my car then take a bus back to Roanoke Friday and start hiking from Daleville on Saturday. Seems like a good way to get a feel for my physical condition as well as a good way of easing my way back into it. We'll see....","Roanoke, VA

Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559665,"April 1010.4 miles Had my friend drop me off this morning at the parking lot on Rt 311 near Catawba. It was a beautiful morning with temps in the 60s and sunny. Got there about 9 and we said our goodbyes. She's planning on picking me up in Daleville tomorrow afternoon making my 2 day test trip 20 miles. As I started to hike I got a little excited again...haven't felt that way in a while. I've been pretty sedentary the last 2 weeks and have been staying at some really nice houses...so you could say I've been getting soft, ha. Anyway, as I was hiking I was thinking back to the first real hike I had ever done, which was to McAfee Knob, sometime in college. We tried to hike the full 20 miles to Daleville that day, in the the summer heat, with little water. Needless to say we bailed 10 down a side trail miles in. We just a bunch of kids and didn't know any better at the time. I got to McAfee Knob and it was spectacular. There were only two other people when I got there and felt so lucky to have the place relatively to myself. It has been mobbed in recent years with all the attention the AT has gotten. A nice girl from Richmond took a few quick photos of me on the rocks and we chatted a bit. We were actually born in the same hospital. Small world! My foot, knee, and hip felt pretty good to start with. About 6 miles in, my foot started to hurt a bit and we'll see how it does tomorrow. I have a feeling it is going to be lingering a bit more than I thought. My plan is to hike 9 miles to Daleville tomorrow, stay at my friends tomorrow night. Then drive to VA Beach to see my family and drop off my van. I'll be there for a few days then come back to Roanoke this weekend. Depending on how the foot feels, I'll try and start hiking on Monday. That will give it another 6 days to heal. Keeping my fingers crossed.Tinker Cliffs were equally amazing. Had lunch there and just stared off into the Catawba Valley. It's so beautiful down there. Had dreamed of living there when I was younger. I continued on to Lamberts Meadow shelter and set up my new tent. Pretty easy set up and we'll see how it does. And there is a nice new bear box here, thanks RATC!Cooking my dinner now and hoping to get a good nights sleep and hit the trail early in the morning.","Roanoke, VA

There was a couple from Vermont, I forgot his name but hers was Home Ec. They were also doing a flip flop hike and started in Bland. It was nice chatting with them an good to hear someone else kinda had the same plan and schedule as me. Then there was another guy at the shelter who went to NC State. Two signs in one day of being in a small word! I got to bed around 9 and tossed and turned quite a bit. Hips were really hurting while I was sleeping...I think it's just a sign of me getting old, ha. Slept in my new silk liner using my quilt as a blanket. The liner is a bit snug but I think I can use it. Warm night...probably stayed in the 50's.Got up around 6:45, packed up and ate a crushed pop tart someone had given me back in Georgia. That pop tart, like me, had made quite the journey.Foot was a bit tender when I started but felt ok most of the day. My left knee and hip were hurting pretty bad from the beginning though. I stopped at rock outcrop about a mile in and stretched a bit and I think that helped some. I also realized that I lead with my left foot going up and down on every step. I think that is the reason my left side hurts so bad. I started making my myself lead with my right foot and that seemed to help as well. Really going to pay close attention to my mechanics from here on out...I think that's the key to my aches and pains, aside from the foot injury.The morning was absolutely spectacular. Cool, with the trail in the shade to start. Lots of views both of Carvins Cove to the SW and Botetourt County to the NE. The sweet smell of dry pine needles on the ground added to the perfect morning. I sat and had lunch at Hay Rock and aired out my feet. I've been putting powder on my feet during breaks and it has helped a ton. No blisters yet and my feet stay drier and feel a ton better. I also put on this knee sleeve with copper I got for $10 somewhere (I think I saw Brett Favre peddle it on TV once, ha). It actually seems to help my knee a bit as well. Had great views of the back of Tinker Mountain. I grew up looking at the front of it from the time I was two and had always dreamed of what was behind there. Made it down to Daleville and walked over the Kroger, and am now just hanging out at Mill Mountain Coffee, waiting for my ride.If my foot and body continue to feel ok, I plan on start hiking again on Monday. I'll drive my car back to the beach tomorrow, spend a day or two with my mom, then catch the bus back to Roanoke.","Lamberts Meadow

All through hikers except Vinegar who is doing a 300 mile section hike. He's taking it fairly easy 10-15 miles a day so we've been staying at the same places. A group of hikers staying there heard about Middle Creek Campground serving breakfast and wanted to get out early. They asked me to join and said sure. It was Wildfower, Dakota, Bear Bait, Butterfeet, and Goldfish. Cool people. We hiked the 3.2 miles down in the rain to the road crossing and Wildfower called the campground and they picked us up! Great campground with a little food counter. I got eggs, sausage, and a biscuit. Awesome. They took us back to the trail and we were off. Since they are all thru hikers and have their legs already they were doing 20 miles a day. So I said my goodbyes and stuck to my plan even though I really wanted to hike with them.My blisters were pretty bad today and I'm realizing my shoes are just too big. After stretching them out and then getting rain on, it was becoming obvious. I was just slipping around in them and I think that's why I'm getting blisters. I decided to stop and double up my socks. It helped a little I believe and we'll see how they do tomorrow. Knees and foot felt good today. However...I tweaked my back on the last descent of the day. It really bummed me out. It's like ever day it's some new physical problem out of the blue. Just crazy. I got to camp and set up my tent and laid down for a bit to see if it settled down a bit. I'm hoping I can take it easy tomorrow and make it through. Just keep pushing...one step at a time.A new group of thru hikers arrived at camp and they're pretty cool as well. One of them actually has on a pair of Nike Terra Kigers! I couldn't believe it. He's been wearing them since Pearisburg and loves them.

Good but long day.  Had my brother take me over Waynesboro and we picked up Vinegar at the hotel.  He gifted me a lot of his resupply he didn't need from his shipment.  Super cool of him!  Got up to the trailhead around 8:30.  Saw Ant Man and Norseman when we got there and hiked most of the day with them.  Really enjoyed the conversation and camaraderie.
The terrain wasn't too bad but it was hot and humid with temps getting into the upper 80's by the afternoon.  Not many vistas at all today, and was a little disappointed in that respect, especially given it was our first day in Shenandoah National Park.  
I did pass the 200 mile mark during the day and was excited about that.  I saw 3 little snakes and lots of wildflowers. No bears yet, but a couple heading southbound said they saw one just ahead of us.  I'm sure we'll see one soon.
Rolled into Blackrock Hut at 6:20, and made dinner.  Another thru hiker had a homemade guitar and let me play it.  It was pretty sweet.

Slept ok and got up around 6am.  Ate some pop tarts, filled up my water, packed up and was out by 7:30am.  Vinegar and I decided to take it a bit easier today since we had pushed it pretty good in the head yesterday.  The goal was 13.2 miles to Pinefield hut.  
A half mile out of camp we got to Blackrock Mtn.  Huge rock formation with 270 degree views.  Was cloudy and drizzly most of the day and this was the only really good view we got.  Scrambled up to the top and got a few pictures. 
Took a morning break at Loft Mountain Campground.  The store hadn't opened for the season yet but we sat in the breezeway and ate and geared up for the impending rain.  Decided to make the 1.2 mile diversion to the Loft Mtn Wayside (which for those keeping track doesn't count in the mileage).  There was a nice little store and basic little grill.  Ate a hot dog and chips and hung out for a bit.  Everyone else had decided to make the detour too, which was a bit surprising.  Ended up hiking the rest of the day with Vinegar, Ace, and Doc as we pushed on to Pinefield Shelter.  Ended up getting caught in a heavy rain for the last 20 minutes and got there around 3:30.  Was an early day but with the threat of bigger storms in the evening we decided to stay put.  The big debate for the evening was where to make camp.  In the previous 2 days there had been reports of a copperhead in the shelter but we hadn't seen it in the hour we had been there. So, it was either stay dry in the shelter and face the threat of a poisonous snake...or set up a tent in the rain and get wet, and have to pack up a wet tent in the morning.  It was a tough call but I opted for wet tent.  Two of the guys set up tents in the shelter.  I'm curious if they have a snake sighting.  
Storm is blowing in now.  Hope to stay relatively dry and get some sleep.  Thinking of 20.8 miles tomorrow.","Blackrock Shelter

Got a pretty heavy storm last night. Lots of rain and wind.  Tent held up good and I stayed dry. Didn't sleep well for some reason again...not sure why. I had traded out my 20 degree quilt for my 40 degree bag and got a little chilly.  I'll have to bundle up a bit better before bed tonight to stay warm.  Got up around 6 and was out of camp by 7:30.  Perfect morning for hiking, with temps in the low 50s and sunny. 
Only one really good view point today which was from Hightop Mountain.  Lots of us hikers have been talking about the lack of views on the trail in Shenandoah NP. It's a bit disappointing.  There are tons of views from Skyline Drive but the trail never get close to them. It's like they don't want the people in cars to see us at view points or something.  When we were along the Blue Ridge Parkway, the trail would come out to viewpoints along the Parkway all the time.  One hiker today, Norseman, got fed up with it and just started hiking along Skyline Drive.  He is going to go into Harrisonburg and see about getting a bike and biking it for the views along his section.  
I was doing good up until lunch then my feet really started hurting bad.  I've got to figure out something with my shoes. I'm carrying two pairs, which is crazy, and I can't hike in either of them too long before they start hurting. I had bought The Salomon XA Pros but they bruised my ankles so bad I left them in Charlottesville.  I contacted Salomon and they did give me a $130 voucher to use online, which is really cool. But I've got to find a shoe that'll work and try it on, then order it and have it shipped out to the trail, which could take a week or more.  I hope to find a place in Front Royal that I can try some Salomons on.  In the meantime, I've got to figure out a way to make it there using what I've got. 
Made it to Lewis Mountain Campground around 5 and got a light resupply at the camp store. The basic stuff, but did splurge on a Butterfinger Ice Cream Bar, Chips, and a Gatorade. Washed my three days of grime off my face in the bathroom and headed for Bearface Mountain Shelter a mile away.

Longest distance day on the trail so far.   22.4 miles officially, but if you're going count the blue blaze side trips it was about 24.  Got up at 6 and was out of the shelter at 7am knowing I had a long day ahead. The first 5 or so miles of trail were flat and beautiful.  Hadn't seen anything like it as of yet.  The next 18 miles it was super rocky with many miles passing where I my feet didn't touch the soil.  
About 7 miles in Vinegar and I took a .8 mile side trip to Big Meadows Wayside.  Absolutely beautiful up there and we would have never have seen it if we didn't make the side trip.  We ate a second breakfast there at the restaurant (Vinegar's treat, thanks man!)...eggs, sausage, potatoes, English muffin....mmmm. Was great!  
For the first time in the park we had lots of views.  It was a great day for pictures, clear, but a bit on the chilly side with temps in the 50s and a strong wind.  Made good time most of the day and took a side trip to the Skyland Resort for Gatorade and a cookie.  
Got to Byrds Nest Hut around 6pm and one of my best friends from high school, Carol, was there with her husband with dinner for me. Some very timely trail magic!  A huge burrito, chips, and chocolate pudding.  They live in Harrisonburg and made the hour long trip one way to see me.  So very grateful to them!  They offered to come and get me tomorrow night and let me stay with them since the weather is looking really nasty. 2-3"" of rain over night.
So the feet/shoe situation.  I made it through the day but picked up some blisters. I'm carrying two pair of shoes, both of which are great, but neither of which fit me. The Wildhorse are too big, and the Terra Kigers too small.  The Wildhorse give me blisters, and the Kigers bruise my heel going uphill because they're too tight.  I also am carrying three insoles trying to help.

Got up at 6 to a beautiful deep red sunrise. But as they say ""Red Sky at morning, sailor take warning"". It is supposed to rain 1-2"" overnight.  My friends are going to pick me up at Gravel Springs shelter this evening so I can avoid the rain, and maybe I can see about some new shoes.
Got out of camp around 7:20 and stayed cloudy and fairly cool most of the day.  After a rocky first couple miles, the terrain got better and not too many big climbs.  Made a side trip to Mary's Rock and got a wonderful view of the northern Shenandoah Valley.  
The highlight of the day was some tasty cheeseburgers at Elkwallow Wayside.  Vinegar and I ate with a couple of section hikers, Tony and Wes.  Cool guys and interesting conversation.  
Got to the shelter at 4:15 and just waiting for my friend now.  Feet hurt quite a bit but made it through the day.  Taped up the blisters and doubled up the socks.  I may end up taking a zero tomorrow, we'll see.

Took a zero day in Harrisonburg and stayed at my friend's house.   They let me use their car and was able to get around town to look for some shoes.  Spent nearly all day.  Went to 3 places with no luck.  They either didn't have anything I could use, or they had something and it wasn't the right size.  In a last ditch effort I went to Dick's and checked out what they had.  A few different kinds of Merrell's, and Timberlands.  I called my shoe guru buddy Don back in Portland for advice as he has designed shoes for nearly every brand out there.  After his input and some discussion, and decided on the Merrell Edge. We'll see how they do...keeping my fingers crossed. 
Headed back to my friends house and they fixed an amazing dinner of sneaks and fresh asparagus.  So grateful for them!!!

Got up around 6:30 and had a great breakfast at my friend's house.  Got up to the trail at 8:45, said my goodbyes and headed out.  It's the first time I had hiked without Vinegar in almost 3 weeks and I'll catch up with him tomorrow as he's taking a zero day in Front Royal.  
Threw on all my rain gear as it looked pretty menacing.  Ended up raining nearly all of the hike.  With temps in the low 40's and a string wind driving the rain, it reminded me a lot of hiking in Oregon.  As I descended down from 3500' towards Front Royal at 1000' the foliage really started to fill in.  Definitely seeing where the moniker ""The Big Green Tunnel"" comes from.  But once again...Oregon has prepared me well in that respect. 
The terrain wasn't too bad, a few climbs but mostly down.  However the trail conditions were pretty treacherous due to the rain over the last two days.  The trail was a running stream at times and at one point I had to bushwhack to detour around a swollen stream.  
I make pretty quick work of the 13.7 miles and made it to Mountain Home Cabbin around 2:30.  I had called earlier to reserve a bed.  When I got there no one was there, so just hung around the hostel area and checked it out.  Didn't see my resupply package that my friend Dave had sent, which is very disconcerting. Called the owners who were out shuttling people and asked about it and they said all the packages where there beside the door.  So, it looks like I'll have to get a ride into town and get a few days of food.  
The shoes seem to have done a pretty good job today. No blisters yet and handled the terrain and rain well. It was only 13 or so miles, so we'lol see how they do on consecutive 20+ days.  Cautiously optimistic.","Gravel Springs Hut

Got a really good nights sleep at Mountain Home Cabbin.  Woke up at 6, got a shower, had some eggs and toast.  Vinegar met me there and we were on the trail a little before 8am.  It was immediately evident it was going to be a muddy, muddy day.  The trail was a stream again for half the day and was pretty difficult to navigate.  Not any real views at all except for a nice stretch in a Meadow, which coincidentally happened to be exactly at my 300 mile mark.  
The vegetation changed quite a bit through the day and was interesting to see it so quickly.  Made it 15 miles over the Dicks Dome Shelter...really nice new one.  Going to stay in the shelter tonight...only my second time since I started.

Cool night with temps in the upper 30's.  I had bought an emergency bivy thingy when I got my shoes since I have my summer bag now. Well...it worked a bit too good.  Ended up sweating, a lot, and sleeping just in my drawers. Ha.  
Woke up at 6, fixed some oatmeal, and was out on the trail at 7:45.  Another spectacular spring morning to hike.  Not many views at all today again, but there was a slight breeze and made the forest come alive. Just beautiful.
About 8 miles into the day we got to the infamous 'Roller Coaster"".  14 miles of continuous ups and downs with no views.  It wasn't too bad terrain wise, like 750'/mile, but it was super rocky which made it no fun.  Got one good view in the stretch from Buzzard Rock and could see back into Shenandoah NP.  It still amazes me that I'm covering all that ground by foot.
Got to Bears Den Hostel at 5pm.  It is owned by the Appalachian Trail Conference and it is amazing.  Big stone structure built in the 1930's and a wonderful oasis on a long day.  They have a hiker special for $30 - bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, Ben & Jerrys Ice cream, drink, and pancakes in the morning.  Can't beat that!
Shoes are doing ok for the most part despite some lingering blister/foot issues. It's still fairly painful but I'm just getting pretty good at just ignoring all that. 
Tomorrow Vinegar and I will go the 20.6 miles to Harper's Ferry.  It his last day on the trail and I'll miss him a lot.

Didn't sleep great last night for some reason...not sure why.  Woke up at 5:40 and went upstairs at the hostel and Crazy Tree had fixed pancakes for everyone.  Awesome. 
Set off for the day and headed for Harpers Ferry 20 miles away.  The first few miles we had the end of the roller coaster, which wasn't too bad.  Hiked most of the day with Vinegar and Crazy Tree.  Crossed back and forth on the ridge between Virginia and West Virginia.  Was another beautiful day, sunny with temps in the upper 60's. 
As the day wore on the trail got increasingly rocky.  So rocky at some points my foot didn't touch soil for miles at a time.  That did get a bit tiring and slowed me down quite a bit.
Made it into Harpers Ferry around 4:45 and went to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters.  Got my picture taken outside and looked around for a second and plan to head back tomorrow and spend some more time.
Headed down with Vinegar to the hostel he was staying at as I was waiting for my cousin to pick me up at 7pm.  Ant Man was there and we all went down to eat down the street.
My cousin picked me up and we headed over to Shepherdstown, what a cool hip town!  I was pretty shocked...wasn't expecting that.  He took me through the historic downtown area and we ate a fancy French Bistro.  Big difference from my trail food!

Slept pretty well at my cousins farm...very peaceful there.  He dropped me off in town around 8:45 at the ATC headquarters.  When I got there, all my friends were there waiting to get in.  Vinegar, Ant Man, Crazy Tree, Doc, Ace, Go Far, Lone Star.  And out of all of them, I was the only one hiking today.  Vinegar and Lone Star finished their sections, Crazy Tree is taking a zero, Ant Man is taking the train to NJ for a few days off, and Doc, Ace, and Go Far are headed to D.C. for a couple of days.  
I told Vinegar goodbye and I hope he hikes a few days with me when I get back down to GA.  He helped me more than I think he knows.  I learned a lot from him and really enjoyed hiking the 300 miles section with him.
So, I'm on my own for now.  I spent most of the day until 12:45pm being a history tourist.  I had read books about John Brown and Harper's Ferry so it was great to see the area first hand.  So many important moments in our country's history happened within 10 miles of here.  Lewis and Clark were even at the Armory in 1803 to get guns for their expedition.
When I finally did start hiking it was a bit odd to be by myself with no set plan of where I was going.  I just kept walking til I felt a bit tired, which was 11 miles in at Crampton Gap Shelter.  I pitched my tent in beautiful grove of trees. Made some dinner and sitting by the fire now.  Figured I would have a nice evening before the rains come tomorrow.  Supposed to be three days straight again.","Harper's Ferry

Cold, rain, and more rain.  Probably the most miserable day I've spent on the trail yet.  I got up at 5:50 and was out of camp by 7, fortunately before the rain started at 7:15.  And it didn't really stop all day.  I had originally planed to hike 14 miles today and tent camp at Annapolis Rocks but that was out of the question.  So was either hike to the shelter at 12 miles or 21.  And of course I chose the 21 option.
First 6-7 miles weren't too bad.  Saw some history sites along the way and stopped at a state park restroom and had a snack.  After that I just was getting soak through my rain gear and with the temps in the upper 40's, I was pretty cold.
The trail was a river all day except in the areas it was an ankle deep pond.  I managed to somehow push through it all and got the the Ensign Cowell Shelter at 4:15.  There was trail magic at the shelter which was awesome and some pretty cool people there so it made for an nice end to the day.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Didn't sleep real well last night in the shelter.  Toss and turned and was a bit cold again. Got up around 6am and left around 7:45am.  Made a new friend at the shelter and we decided to hike together for a bit.  She had started a flip flop hike from Harpers Ferry 3 days ago and is taking it fairly slow to start, 12-15 miles per day, and it'll be good for me to slow down a bit. She doesn't have a trail name yet...but I'm sure she'll get one soon. 
The weather was a lot better, cloudy with no rain and temps in around 50.  The terrain wasn't too difficult either and a lot of water had drained off the trail. Had a couple of good views, the first in a few days and got to see some the terrain I was traveling through. 
The highlight of the day was crossed another state off the list, Maryland. And with that I crossed the Mason Dixon Line and into Pennsylvania.  Already heard lots of stories about the rocks there...I'm sure I'll find out about them soon enough.
The forecast was calling for heavy rain again tonight so we decided to head into Rouzerville and get a room for the night and clean up and resupply.   Tried to hitchhike but it was a big road going down hill and no place for a car to stop to pick us up.  And if they did it would have been super dangerous. So we ended up walking the over 2 miles into town. 
Very happy to have a shower and clean clothes.  Had some Chinese food for dinner and Ben and Jerrys ice cream for dessert.  Awesome.

A guy saw me walking with my pack in the parking lot and offered me a ride to the trail head.  Didn't even have to put out my thumb, awesome!  We stopped by the store and picked up Anastasia and got up to the trail around 11:45.
 It had stopped raining and the weather was ideal...cloudy with temps in the 50's.  Pretty easy day of hiking with only one decent climb.  Passed by one of the coolest shelters I'd seen, Tumbling Rock, and stopped and took some pictures.
The highlight of the day for me was hitting the 400 mile mark. Still hard to believe sometimes I've made it this far.  
We had planned on doing about 7 miles with the late start but we're making good time and ended up going 12.3 to Rocky Mountain Shelters.  Didn't see a place to pitch tents there so we headed back up the hill and and pitched them there.  Made some dinner and watched a nice sunset thru the trees.  Planning on about 13 miles tomorrow.  Still trying to keep it on the lower side of things for a little while.  Realized that I've hiked at least double digit miles the last 8 days, and 2 were 20+.  Weather tomorrow is looking nice, sunny with highs in the 60's.","Rouzerville

It was pretty evident from the beginning that today was going to be a lazily paced day.  Took our time doing about everything, which was fine.  The trail has been super easy the last couple days with not many climbs and not a lot of rocks.  Usually I would have been doing 20+ miles easily but it's nice to be hanging back a bit.
Stopped at Caledonia State Park and ate a snack and called our moms for Mother's Day.  I had sent my mom a picture postcard of me that was taken at Harper's Ferry at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters.  We filled up with water and headed up the trail and took another little break at Quarry Gap Shelter.  It is the most amazing one I'd seen yet.  It had hanging plants, bench swing, sunlight over the covered picnic table, wood tent pads, bear box, thermometer, and a sundial.  While we were sitting there, the caretaker Jim came up the trail.  We chatted with him a bit and he was a delightful and fascinating man.  He built the shelters from scratch and had been a caretaker for 42 years.  Just amazing.
We headed back out and made it to Birch Run Shelter at 4:45pm.  Pitch our tents by a beautiful stream and then made some dinner.  Chatted with some hikers at the shelter and made a little fire.  Really nice day.
On a side note, I've been having some big issues with my Zpacks Arc Haul backpack.  The shoulder straps are fraying as are the hipbelts.  None of the straps with stay put and they all have to be tied off, which is super annoying. The mesh in the back is full of holes.  The pack just doesn't ride well and I'm constantly fiddling with it trying to make it better but nothing works.  I've talked to 6 other hikers who all switched packs this year after experiencing similar issues.  I emailed the company and they offered to send me new webbing on my pack for me to fix myself.  At this point, for me it's more of a design issue and I'd rather have something else.","Rocky Mountain Shelters

It seems like we've found a trail name for Anastasia...Tater.  Last night whilst making her instant potatoes for dinner, she got them everywhere. On her fingers, her clothes, the ground, and even managed to drop a carabiner in the packaging somehow. She's also a vegetarian so it kinda fits.  We'll see if it sticks.
Made pretty good time most of the day.  I had purposely not been eating a lot today because we were going by the Pine Grove Furnace Camp store, home of the Half Gallon Ice Cream Challenge. I was ready but when we got there 10 miles into the day, they were closed.  Super bummed.  They're only open Fri- Sun until Memorial Day.  I think there are a couple other places along the trail that are doing it so I see if I'm still up for it.
Right beside the store is the AT Museum.  Cool little place and Tater and I checked it out and learned a bit more about the history. They had an old guitar behind the couch and and I got to play and sing a couple of songs...felt good.

The first part of the day the were some decent little ups and downs...first ones for a few days.  Was still a beautiful morning, sunny with temps near 70.  Talked to a few day hikers from the area along the way heading southbound and was cool to get their perspective on things.
Saw a couple of snakes, a garder and a black.  A couple we passed up the trail saw a rattlesnake but we didn't run across it.
I was having a really good day...but Tater was not.  One of her trekking poles snapped in the rocks, and she had a big blister pop on the back of her heal. I gave her my poles for the way down into Boiling Springs. About 2 miles from town the terrain changed from rocky hills to flat pastures.  Once out into the fields the change was starkly evident and beautiful.  It was getting pretty hot at the point, 85, and heading into town.  It was the first thing for me that the Trail actually went through a town.  Beautiful old little town.  Tater stopped at the Post Office to get her mail drop and I went to a little outfitter across the street to look for poles.  No luck.
We'd hiked 12 miles already and both were pretty worn out and beat up, but there is no camping near town because of the pastures, no shelter for 14 miles, and no hotel in town.  Our only option was to push on 8 miles to Carlisle, PA and stay in a hotel.  The only good news was that it was very flat terrain.  
I ended up having a nice afternoon with the trail weaving in and out of groves of trees and into the pastures.  Lots of wildflowers around and it wasn't blazing hot.  Listened to a little music on my phone at the end of the day...it was a nice treat.  
The whole vibe of the trail during that section made me think of warm summer evenings back on the farm we had in Bonsack, VA.  Made me so grateful for the opportunity to be out on the trail and in nature. 
Tater was struggling quite a bit and felt really bad for her...but she's a trooper.  Made it the 20 miles to Rt. 11 and down to the hotel.  It was her first 20 mile day, and she went over 100 for hike.
Got to the hotel, cleaned up, did laundry, and ordered pizza.  Awesome.

Besides being hot, the day wasn't too bad for me for the most part.  Fairly easy terrain with only one steep climb.  The trail wove in and out of pastures, beside creeks, and through woods much of the morning.

Tater and I walked around a bit and stopped by the PO. We had some perfect timing as her second package came in when we were at the counter.  So, she now has some new trekking poles, and get to use mine again...we were both pretty happy.
Decided to hit the trail and stop at the truck stop at the edge of town to get some Gatorade, charge up phones, and wait out the heat for an hour or so.  Was a good call as when we got back on trail at 3:30, there was a little cloud cover and a nice breeze.

Along the way I hit my 500 mile mark.  Big milestone and I was very excited.  Around that point the trail hit a particularity beautiful section.  Pine trees with little ground cover, and the trail ran parallel to a stream.  Little moments like that are what make the arduous journey worthwhile.  
We started making our way downhill toward the road and took a break to rewrap our feet and blisters.  A former thru hiker named 'Earnhardt' (he had a passing resemblance to Dale Jr) came up the trail and offer us some candy and Gatorade.  He was out for the evening with his dog, Clyde, but was debating going back since it was supposed to rain.  He offered us a ride into Lickdale, PA and after some discussion we gratefully accepted.

Slept ok last night and got up early around 5:30.  Made the right call about staying in the shelter as it rained pretty hard for a while during the night. Ate breakfast, packed up, and Tater and I were out on the trail by 6:40. 
Started to clear up a bit while we were hiking and ended up being a nice morning.  The trail alternated between being horribly rocky, and flat trail with no rocks.  Over all it wasn't too bad.  Made good time and got into Port Clinton around 10:45.  Headed over to the barber shop to get a haircut and was greeted by Frank. He has doughnuts, cookies, and coffee for hikers, and he plays guitar and let me play a bit. Was nice to be able to sit down with an instrument for a while.  For the first time on the trail I'm realizing how much I miss music.  
Got a haircut (it was only $8!),  and Ant Man showed up with his dad.  They gave us a ride to Walmart for a quick resupply and then dropped Tater and I at the Post Office where we both had packages. I received my new Osprey Atmos backpack and sent my Zpacks back home.  It's going to take a while to get used to and really hope it works ok. 
Got a ride from there to Cabellas from Steve and Tater and I picked up a few things.  He took us back to Port Clinton and Tater and I decided to stay in town at the town pavilion since a big storm will be coming through tonight. 
We walked over to the hotel and ate dinner (fish and chips for me) and now back at the pavilion.  While I was writing my journal, we had a nice family drop off some trail magic of Gatorade and snack packets.  Everyone at the pavilion was commenting on how nice and generous people have been in the area the last few days.  Very grateful.
Hoping to get a good night sleep and hike 15 miles in the rain to Eckville Shelter.","Eagles Nest Shelter

Rain started around 3am and was really glad we were staying at the pavilion.  Got up around 6:30 and took our time getting out since it was raining and got out on the trail at 8:50.
Was raining really hard and was cold with temps in the low 50's most of the day.  It was my fist day with my new backpack and was concerned about how it do since I'd never even tried it on before.  And it was 2lbs heavier and I was carrying the equivalent of 6 days of food. I wouldn't normally carry that much, but I had SO much trail magic food...felt like I had to carry it. And was curious to see how the pack would do with that much weight since I'll need to in ME during the 100 Mile Wilderness.  Was probably pushing 40 lbs...ugh.
The first part of the day was absolutely miserable.  Cold, windy, and rainy...just a nasty, raw day.  The pack felt good for the first two miles, then my hips started to hurt bad.  Like horribly bad.  Pushed on in the rain another 6 miles to a shelter and stopped to take a break. Was cold, wet, hurting, and worn out.  Stretched a bit, ate some food, and rested.  An older couple came in, King Foo Fooey and Dori, and we chatted.  He gave me his handmade waterproof mittens as he said he couldn't use them.  My thumbs were numb at this point and I was very grateful.
Headed back out and my hips started loosening up a bit. Really hoping it's just a matter of me getting used to that pack and the difference in the way it carries weight.
Had a couple of viewpoints but with the rain couldn't see anything at all. Was rocky a good part of the day and getting used to having to take things slow, especially in the rain.
Toward the end of the day my feet and toes were getting raw from rubbing the wet socks.  My toes were a starting to bleed a little so I duct taped them up for the last couple of miles.  Not sure how they're going to do tomorrow.  At least it's not supposed to rain.
Got to Eckville Shelter and was already full so I'm sleeping on the floor.  It's ok...they're are some nice people in there and we all pitched in an ordered pizza.  Sweet.
Going to storm tonight...very grateful to be in a shelter.","Port Clinton, PA

Tough day. Slept ok at Eckville. Got up at 6:20, and on the trail by 8am.  Was a nice, dry, warmer morning and things felt good.  Had a decent climb to start the day and then started hitting some nasty rocks. My feet, and more specifically my toes, began to really hurt.  After a few miles the pain was getting to be too much and decided to stop at Allentown HC Shelter.  
My toes/feet looked horrible.  Red and swollen on the top, and raw underneath.  Decided to call it a day and try to figure out some options.  For over 3 weeks now they have been hurting me and I thought it could be athletes foot.  So I've been treating it as such with antifungals and keeping them as clean and dry as I can. They'd get a little better and then worse.  No cracking of the skin, don't itch and nothing ever in between my toes.  So now since it's been getting worse, I'm at a loss, and not sure if it's athletes foot or not.   I sent a nurse/PT friend of mine pics and she's thinks it's friction/shoe related and not AF. Going to stop the treatment and see if it gets any better.  If not, going to try to hike the 18 miles to Palmerton and see a Doctor.  Been dealing with it for over 3 weeks now and it's just wearing me out.

Got up at 5:45am after sleeping fairly well.  Feet still looked horrible but decided to make a go of it today.  Taped all my toes individually and the sides of my feet with KT tape. Took about an hour to tape.  Got out of camp at 7:40. The weather was good today, partly cloudy with a high around 70.  The first 4 miles were relatively easy as the trail followed a road bed. Made good time with a pace of 3 miles and hour.  After that we hit some big rocks and the infamous Knife Edge...a few hundred yard rock scramble with drops on each side.  Was kinda fun doing that even with the pain I was in.
Hit lots more rocks the next few miles and slowed us down a bit.  The trail finally cleared up a tad 10 miles in and I decided just to push it as far as I could go today.  18 miles would put us in Palmerton and could stay there at Berts and get a shower.
Ended up getting to Outerbridge Shelter around 2:55.   Had done almost 17 miles in a little over 7 hours...not bad for the condition my feet were in and going over rocks.
Tater came in about an hour later and we called and got a ride to Bert's. Super cool place with 6 bunks.  Free laundry, shower, and shuttle from the trailhead, and really nice to boot.  Best deal on the trail yet! 
Took a shower, did laundry, and getting ready to head over to eat.Supposed to head up the rocks at Lehigh Gap tomorrow morning.  We'll see how my feet feel...","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Woke up around 6 at the hostel and didn't sleep so well.  My foot was noticeably worse and could see a red area spreading to my foot from my toes.  Didn't know what it was...but knew it wasn't good at all.  Decided to take a zero day and try and get to a doctor.
Went into Berts for breakfast at 8:30 and asked around about shuttles so I could go to a walk in clinic 20 minutes in Jim Thorpe, PA.  The owner, Tracy, offered me a ride.  So grateful!!!  
The doctor said it was cellulitis, is a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. It is potential very dangerous, but fortunately I caught it in time.  She prescribed me an antibiotic and a steroid.  She said to take the day off and I could start hiking tomorrow if it looked better.  Even though it's super painful and not fun at all, it was a relief to hear that I would have to be off the trail for weeks again.  Thinking the shoes I bought 3 weeks ago may have been the culprit.  May have caused some abrasions on my toes that just got worse over time, and definitely worse in the rain. Not sure if that's the case, but decided to order new shoes to be delivered to Mohican Outdoor Center. Ordered the Vasque Inhaler Low...going to give them a try.  
Came back to the hostel and have just been trying to rest, eat, and rehydrate the best I can.
And speaking of eating, I weighed myself a few days ago and I have only lost one pound.  Crazy.  I had put on 10 pounds (mainly in doughnuts!) before I left specifically thinking I'd need the extra weight since I'd probably been loosing quite a bit.  I'm in the best shape I've ever been...but still 9 pounds over my normal weight, ha.
It's supposed to rain tomorrow, which is not good due to my feet...and the rock scramble out of Lehigh Gap.  Would like to get out...but we'll see. ","Palmerton

I had been wary of this day for months.  The climb out of Lehigh Gap. I had seen pictures, heard lots of stories of the infamous rock scramble. It was going to be tough...especially since I'm terrified of heights. I once got up at 4:30 am, hiked the 17 mile around trip to Half Dome in Yosemite, and when I got up there, I took one look at it and said ""No way"".  Same thing with Angel's Landing in Zion.  So this climb has been in the back of my mind ever since I decided to hike the AT.  
Didn't sleep well again and got up around 6. My feet looked a bit better and decided to tape them up and go ahead and hike today. It was raining and we decided to wait until 10am when the rain stopped to start hiking.  Didn't want to attempt that climb in the rain.
There were 5 of us at the hostel that were headed up there, me, Tater, Mountain Mama and her two teenage girls.  We were all a bit nervous. There is a blue blaze winter trail that bypasses it. But I had gotten it in my mind that I would hike it no matter what and treat it like I've been treating every uphill that I've encountered so far.  Just attack it.
And so I did. Lots of hand of feet climbing with the packs, but honestly it wasn't that bad at all. Only two tricky parts that had me a bit concerned but I didn't freeze and made it through. Once again, the training I did in Oregon prepared me well.  Especially the climb up Table Mountain and Cooper Spur, both of which have some serious rock scrambles and are steeper.  Very grateful today.
The rest of the day was pretty easy. Mostly flat with the typical rocks along the way.  Made it the shelter and saw Butterfeet who I hadn't seen since my second night back out.  And there was a guy in the shelter who had a guitar and I got to play and song for about an hour.  It was great!
Feet looked ok.  Still red and some skin peeled off with the tape, but no big open spots and they didn't bother me most of the day.  Tomorrow is supposed to be wet and I'm a bit worried. Hoping it'll be ok.","Palmerton, PA

Another tough day.  Got up early at 5:45 and out of camp by 7:30.  Feet looked pretty good to start but had to throw on wet socks as we were expecting some storms today.  The plan was to go 20.1 miles to Delaware Water Gap.
The trail was rocky and it was misty and foggy all day and it made things miserable...especially on my feet.  Decided to just push as hard as I could so I could get to DWG and get a shower and get my feet cleaned up.
Ended up passing my 600 mile marker.  Still amazes me every time I pass a milestone that I'm still out here, especially given all that I've been through.
Feet were getting super raw and irritated and had to stop for an hour at a shelter and wash them off, dry them, retape them, and out some clean socks.  Helped a little bit but started hurting again after a while.
Pushed it again the rest of the day, and at times was going 3.5 miles and hour.  Made it to the hostel at 4:15 and it was already full.  Will probably sleep on the floor.  Went across the street to the Post Office and picked up my resupply from my brother and he sent me and extra pair of socks to help with the feet.

Tossed and turned most of the night.  Was really crowed at the hostel so I slept on the couch.  I can feel that the bubble is starting to catch up a little.  
Got up around 7 and my feet were pretty bad still.  I'm thinking I'm going to have to take at least 2 zeros to let this heal better.  The more I look at it and talk to people, I think I my toes/feet got rubbed raw in the rain, which is essentially trench foot.  Got some open spots that I tried to cover/tape and it made it worse by pulling skin apart. Then I got cellulitis because of it.  The biggest priority when I resume hiking is to keep my feet as dry as possible.  I have new shoes (Vasque Inhaler) coming to Mohican Outdoor Center.  I have waterproof socks and a pair of liners from home coming there as well.  I'll only wear them when it's wet/raining as I don't want to sweat in them.  I also bought a pair in Injinji socks here in town and hope we'll see how they do.  
The toughest part of this is that my hiking buddy Tater had to move on without me.  We had been inseparable for 3 weeks and I had really enjoyed her company.  Lots of hours on the trail talking about football, gear, food, and life.  Hope we meet up again sometime.
Walked around Delaware Water Gap a bit.  Cool little town.  They have a great bakery here, and have a $2.95 hot dog and homemade pie special.  Looking forward to sampling some more baked goods tomorrow.  There is also a good outfitter here and I spent some time trying on some shoes.  Found some Salomon's that fit and I actually like. I still have that voucher from them from the XA Pros that didn't work so I think I'll order the Odyssey Pros and have them sent to my moms and send them when I need new shoes (which could be next week, ha)
Weighed myself today and somehow I lost 9 pounds in 10 days.  I had only lost 1 pound in 6 weeks before that.  So now I've lost all the 'doughnut weight' I purposely put on in Portland and am back to my usual weight.  
Hope to get some sleep tonight and have another good zero tomorrow and heal up more.  The hardest thing for me is being idle, but this trail is definitely teaching me the importance of being patient. ","Delaware Water Gap

Didn't sleep hardly at all last night.  I was laying there in the bunk at the hostel feeling like a caged animal...full of energy and wanting to go.  
Ended up rolling out of bed around 7 and chatted a bit with people.  Went down to the bakery and got breakfast and hung around the hostel most of the day.  Was really quiet and no one was around and did some emailing and played guitar.  
Felt a little lonely for the first time in a while and really just wanted to be back on the trail. The last two days have been absolutely spectacular and would have been amazing out there. My feet are scabbing over and are doing better that way. However, I'm afraid they're going to start cracking when I hike. Then when the rains come I'll be in trouble again.  I'm going to start hiking tomorrow but I'm going to have to be really careful.
I have two packages that should be at Mohican Outdoor Center tomorrow.  One from REI with new shoes, pants and underwear. And another from my brother with waterproof socks and rain pants.  
The best part of the day was that the church hosts a hiker meal every Thursday and it was amazing. Bbq, veggies, and homemade desserts.  Beautiful.

Today was like a caged animal had been released. 31.4 miles.  I had sat in the hostel the last two days taking zeros, watching friends come and go, and it was hard on me.  I knew I had to be patient and heal, but I just wanted to get out of there. I hadn't slept hardly at all the last 3 nights there...too much going through my mind.
Got up at 6:15 and was on the trail at 6:50.  I hadn't set out to do all those miles, especially since I had to go by Mohican Outdoor Center and wait for a package. Just was hoping that my feet felt ok, and that I could walk.
Got to MOC at 10:45 and my shoes were there...but they didn't fit right. So I'll have send them back when I get to a post office.  Until then I have to suffer the 2 lb penalty.  My socks came from my brother around 12:15 and was back out on the trail around 12:30.
Was a really beautiful day, sunny with temps in the 70s, the terrain wasn't too bad, and my feet felt decent...so I just decided to go for it.  Ended up stoping around 8:15 and had done 31.4.  It felt good...and glad I got some of that energy out.  Hoping I can sleep tonight.","Delaware Water Gap

Long day.  Had hoped to hike farther but just wasn't in the cards. Got up at 5:30 and out on the trail by 6:45.  My energy was good but my muscles were a bit stiff in my legs so had to reign in my pace quite a bit.  Never felt like I could get into a groove today.
Was another beautiful day, sunny and temps in the 70's.  Just spectacular.  Lots of varied terrain from the highest point in NJ, to meadows, to gentle forests.  
Didn't see hardly anyone out on the trail today.  Starting to get a bit lonely and missing my friends. That's probably the reason I've been pushing so hard the last two days to catch up with them. But I know my body can't keep up this pace.  Was feeling good at 20 miles today, but after that started to get some nasty blisters on the balls of my feet.  Made it to the next shelter...we'll see what happens tomorrow.

Slept ok last night and woke up around 6:30.  Immediately noticed my foot and knew I was going to have a problem today.  Blister was huge and painful right in the middle of the balls of my right foot. Really bad place for a blister. Hurt horribly just walking to the privy in my camp shoes.  Not sure how it had gotten that bad.  I had taken off my shoes and checked my feet at mile 21 and they were fine.  Felt a little pain around mile 25 and the blister was there. 
Decided I had to pop it if there was  a chance of hiking at all today.  I've had blisters on my heels for weeks and little ones on my toes, but this was the first one I had to pop. So, took out my needle, sanitized it and went to work.  Had to do it a couple times to get everything out.  Got out of camp at 8:15 and took it slow.  Was super painful and with heavy rain coming this afternoon, I decided to hike the 6.5 miles to Vernon and see about staying in a hotel.  
The trail was great for the time I was on it. Wove through forests, hills, and swamp, and hit a long section of boardwalk that was absolutely spectacular. Was able to breathe for a moment through the pain and just enjoy my surroundings.  
Called the Appalachian Motel to get a room and they also offered shuttle service from the trail.  Very grateful.

Didn't sleep hardly at all last night. My mind kept wandering and my legs were still twitching from all the miles the past few days. Got up and wrote a bit in my personal journal and laid around until about 7.
Got up and my foot felt a little better. Still very painful, but better than yesterday. Realized that under my blister my foot is bruised and not sure how that happened.  Guess that's why it hurt so bad. I could have hiked, and normally I would have, but felt like I needed a day for me to mentally regroup.  I can tell I've lost more weight.  In the first 5 weeks, I was down 1 pound.  Now in 2 weeks I'm down about 15. I think it's all the stress from the injuries and dealing with the pain. It's just worn me out.  
Decided to walk the 3 mile round trip into town and get as much food as I could carry back at the store. Wasn't an easy walk into town with no sidewalks, and no shoulders at all.  
Spent most of the day stretching, meditating, writing, and of course eating.  Some things I can control in this journey, and many others I can't.  It's all about the outlook and I'm very grateful to be on this path.

Good day today.  Slept ok but woke up way too early, like at 4:15.  Couldn't go back to sleep.  The zero day caged animal was awake inside me again.  Had to really fight not doing another 25-30 mile day.  Took my time, stretched, made breakfast, showered, and looked at the weather. Was supposed to rain much of the day, which had me pretty worried about my feet.  
Made myself wait to get on the trail about 8 so I wouldn't be tempted to push it.  The first part of the day was the 'Stairway To Heaven' and wasn't nearly as bad as people had made it out to be.  The temps were around 50 all day, and it started raining around 11.  Really reminded me of being back at Oregon and just put me in a good mood.  Wore my waterproof socks my brother had sent me and they actually did a decent job of keeping my feet dry.  Still clammy from sweat, but they didn't look like the had before...which is good.  Lots of dead skin falling off from the cellulitis and such, but no cuts or open skin.  Still dealing with the blisters and they're painful, but I can handle them for the most part.
Big thing for today is that I crossed into NY!  Very excited to have another state down, and must say NJ has been my favorite so far. After the state line, the trail got rocky, and extremely slick.  With it raining, it was by far the most treacherous section of trail I had encountered so far.  I took it super slow and still slipped a time or too.  
15 miles into my day, there was an ice cream stand...and I couldn't have been more excited!  I had seen it listed somewhere months ago and had been anxiously awaiting the day. And I wasn't disappointed.  The ice cream was amazing.  So amazing I went back for more and made it my dinner, ha.

First up was Bear Mountain Tower witch some great views of the Hudson. Then the historic Bear Mountain Inn where we stopped for a late morning snack.  
After that the trail goes right through a zoo for animals that are old or rehabbing.  Actually saw my first bear on the trail there, ha! 
Walked into Fort Montgomery to get a couple of packages at the Post Office.  A resupply from my friend Dave, and my new shoes for REI.  Dave always sends great stuff and super excited when I get a package from him.  
Got my Altra Lone Peak 3.5's. So far I like them.  My big toe is hitting a little when going down hill, so may have to go up to a size 11.  Going to give it til tomorrow to decide.
A very nice woman at the Post Office offered to give Tater and I a ride to the grocery so she could resupply.  Was wonderful because she would have had to have resupplied at a conscience store.
Hiked out of town over the Hudson and the view was great.  Ended up doing a little over 13 miles to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center where they allow hikers to camp in the athletic fields.  There are about 10 of us here including Tater, Butterfeet, Norsemen, Shivers and Shivers Dad.  Lots of fun hanging out for the evening,","West Mountain Shelter

Started getting warm and there were lots of pointless ups and downs.  My toes were banging my shoes pretty bad and made the hiking pretty painful.  I decided to order a half size bigger and will send these back in Salisbury, CT.  After walking in these all day, not sure if they are going to work in the bigger size either. Feet are really fatigued, sore, and I feel clumsy in them.  I actually fell on a flat stretch of trail and Tater was behind and was really surprised by it.  I'm ok, but it was weird.  I'm stuck with them til Salisbury so I'm hoping I can hike.  I'm just exhausted from dealing with the shoe/foot issues.  
 No real views or many things to see along the trail today.  Was kinda one of the big green tunnel kinda of days. 
Got to the state park and they have free camping for AT hikers so we figured we would stay there.  Was a long walk off trail to the campground...a lot longer than we were expecting.  And when we got there the sites for the hikers were terrible.  Uneven and rocky with lots of underbrush.  We decided to just get a pay site and the attendant ended up just giving us one.  Very cool.

Got up around 5:30 and out of camp at 7:15.  After our 1.2 mile walk through the State Park we were out on the trail by 7:50.  Warm humid morning that turned into a hot humid day.  Trail was so much better today than yesterday and made things enjoyable even though it was hotter.
Got a couple of good views and the rocks weren't too bad.  Tater and I took our time and got to Morgan Stewart shelter at around 3. Norsemen was already there and we all just decided to stay put for the day and rest up a bit.  Was nice to get into camp early and just relax a bit.

Tater and I made a 1.2 round trip detour to Tony's Deli.  I got a BBQ roast beef sandwich and some ice cream, awesome.  We stayed there for a couple of hours to beat some of the heat and charge our phones.
Back out on the trail around 2:15 and had some nice trail the rest of the way to the shelter.  Norsemen, Thor (Norsemen's beards trail name, ha), and Towlie were there.  Had a good time chatting a bit and making dinner.  Started a fire, even with the heat, to try and keep some of the mosquitoes away.

Good day, but long, and really hot.  Didn't sleep well at all because it was so hot and sticky.  Got up at 4:30 and on the trail by 5:50. Was a beautiful walk for the first part of the day with a climb, and the trail crossed into Connecticut. After that, the trail followed the Housatonic River with some great views of nice rapids and really pleasant walk.  
Tater and I decided to take a little detour after 5 miles to the Bulls Bridge Country Store.  Great little place with super friendly owners. Met up with Norsemen (and Thor) there and had a breakfast sandwich and Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream at an outside picnic table with and umbrella.  Perfect morning stop. 
After that the climbs got harder and the temps got hotter. Was pretty miserable but we kept on pushing all day. Took a two hour break at Mt Algo Shelter during the heat of the day. Started back up again around 3 or so.
Lots more climbing and some core for the rest of the day.  Ended up with a river side walk to end the day for 2.5 miles that would have been perfect...except for the mosquitoes. They were absolutely relentless. We walked passed a guy in a RV who was set up for a little trail magic.  Ice Cream sandwiches, water, and bug spray.  His seemed to work a bit better than ours.
Made it to Shelter around 7:15 and decided to get into the tents to avoid the bugs.  Walden and Towlie made it into camp too.  Fixed some dinner and cleaned up a bit in the brook.  Felt much better afterwards.

Slept pretty well in the tent last night and took our time getting up and going since we'd planed a nero in Cornwall Bridge.  Made breakfast and hung out with Towlie a bit.  Got out of camp by 9.
The first two miles followed the river and then a field.  Was really nice but with temps already at 84 at 10am with a dew point of 70, it made things really uncomfortable.  Right around there I hit my 800 mile mark.  Still can't believe I've made it this far.  After that we had a decent climb and decent down to the road then a mile road walk into town. Stopped by the Country Store and it was awesome.  Got a sandwich and tots, and some snacks.  
Checked into the hotel up the street around 12:30 and got cleaned up.  Shower was amazing.  Headed back to the store for more food. And then when we got back to the hotel discovered a Sushi place delivered. So we had to do that too, ha.  Hiker hunger has definitely set in.

Slept ok in the hotel last night and got up around 6:30am. Took our time getting up and ready and got out of the hotel around 9am.  Went and got breakfast at the country store and it was great!  Pancakes...mmm.  Didn't get a hitch back to the trail so walked the 1.3 miles. Got on the trail around 10:30.
Was an absolutely gorgeous day with temps in the upper 70's and lower humidity.  Huge contrast from the last three days.  The trail was pleasant as well.  Not a lot of rocks, some decent climbs but nothing hard, walks along ridges and rivers. All and all a great day.  The forest in Connecticut has been spectacular as there are more and more coniferous trees mixing in.  The pine needles make the trail soft, the forest floor is opening up more, and the needles smell wonderful.
Feet were pretty tired/sore by the end of the day.  Hoping the larger size shoes I get tomorrow will help that.
Made it to the shelter around 7pm.  Long steep side trail to the shelter, .5 miles and 300' down. Usually I would think of doing it but in CT you have to camp at shelters or designated campsites.  And they can be quite a distance apart.

Tough day, on many levels.  Slept ok, and got out of camp at 6:40 which was great.  Had an amazing view to start my day and was so grateful. But then started thinking about my dad a bit, and just got a down.  Tomorrow will be 4 years since he passed away, on Father's Day of all days.  Miss him so much, and he was in my thoughts all day.
Got into Salisbury a little after 8 and stopped in a great bakery before the Post Office opened. Tater was shortly behind and joined me.  Had some fabulous pastries and some decaf coffee.  The NE really has a familiar feeling for me...reminds me of Portland a lot. 
After that we headed to the Post Office and picked up our packages.  I had yet another pair of shoes, and a resupply box from my friend Dave (thanks!!).  Tater got a resupply from her mom (thanks for the m&m's).  Before we set out, Tater said she'd rather not hike with me anymore and do more things on her own. I was sad, but I get it...we all have to hike our own hike.
I set off up the road toward the trail and already felt the shoes weren't going to work. It's a sinking feeling but at this point I'm just going to have to deal with the pain/issues. I will be coming of trail June 29-July 5 to go back to Oregon to play a show. When I'm there, I'm going to sit in REI and try on every pair of shoes they have. 
The trail was nice, but pretty challenging all day, especially with the shoes and me not feeling the greatest.  Some nice views, some steep climbs and descents, and I passed into Massachusetts.  Halfway through the day I realized that not only do I have a collection of mosquito bites on my legs, but somehow have gotten poison ivy on them too. I am super careful about poison ivy...like rediculously so. But when I walk my shoes rub the inside of my legs at times and I think that's what happened.  I went down the creek and washed them off the bed I could.  Then I remembered Vinegar gave me some Technu packets and I used them.  Hope I can keep it contained. 
Feet were aching pretty bad as I got into camp around 6:15.  Set up my tent and chatted with Squirrel a bit. She gave me some homemade cookies which made me feel a bit better. Hope to get some sleep.  Supposed to rain tomorrow.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Great day today.  Slept ok in my tent and got up and out of camp by 6:50am.  Cool cloudy morning with some heavy rain that was expected later on. Had a good little descent to start with some nice views.  Then hit a relatively flat section for miles around Great Barrington, MA.  About 7 miles in got some great trail magic from former thru hikers Gray Squirrel and Flossie.  Had a breakfast pastry, chips, a drink, and she made me a sandwich and gave me cookies to go.  Amazing.
Caught up to Squirrel shortly there after and we hiked together most of the day. Was nice chatting with her. She is doing a short section and will be done next week sometime.  
We had lunch at Tom Leonard Shelter and ran into Norsemen and Towlie.  Great seeing them again!  Will probably catch back up to them tomorrow as we are all aiming for the Upper Goose Pond Cabin tomorrow. 
Started raining pretty hard in the afternoon and since it was in the 60s didn't even bother with the rain gear. That is except for the goretex socks. Wore them today and they kept my feet dry again.  Just been super paranoid with my feet after the trench foot and cellulitis, and just want to keep them as dry as possible.  It's supposed to rain the next 4-5 days, so that might be tough.  
And speaking of feet, mine are sore and hurting. But I'm just trying to accept it the best I can and push on til I can get something else shoe wise in Portland. 
Got into the shelter super early at 3:30.  Was nice to get almost 20 miles and and have time to relax a bit.  Squirrel and I are the only ones here at the shelter, but the big group of 11 is shortly behind us and I have a feeling we'll see them soon.","Glen Brook Shelter

Didn't sleep too great last night.  Tater came in and we chatted a bit, which was nice. Then the big group of 10 came in after that and it got a bit chaotic after that. Got to sleep around 9:30.
Woke up around 4:30 and got up at 5.  Was out on the trail by 5:50. All of us, Squirrel, Tater, Norsemen, Towlie, Downhill and JD, had decided to go to Upper Goose Pond Cabin.  As did the group of 10.  So I wanted to get out early to make sure I got a bunk.
Started hiking and although it wasn't raining, it was foggy and the ground was really wet.  Worried about my feet. They seemed like they were ok, but getting soaked days in a row just scares me.  
The trail and scenery were nice.  Couple of good views, passed through some pastures with cows, and some easy sections of trail through a beautiful open forest bed beneath pine and birch trees.
Pushed things pretty good even though my feet were hurting.  Ended up doing 10 miles by 10 and was at the cabin before noon. Kinda crazy, but felt good.  Since it was so early had thought about doing the 36 total to Dalton. But didn't want to push things with my feet.
The cabin is amazing.  15 bunks with mattresses, a big pond outlet front that I went swimming in, nice picnic area out back to cook in.  And the caretaker makes pancakes in the morning. Just great.  I had the place to myself for a couple hours then everyone started rolling in.  Full house.
Tomorrow I'll head the 20.7 into Dalton, MA and probably share a room with Squirrel and Tater. I have to boxes go pick up Monday morning at the Post Office and I need to get some other resupply and fuel.  ","Wilcox South Shelter

Crazy kinda day.  Slept well at the cabin and was up by 5:30.  The caretaker made pancakes by 6:30 and was out on the trail by 6:45.  Had made tentative plans to get a room with Tater and Squirrel in Dalton, MA.  Around 7:30 called the Shamrock Village Inn and made a reservation for two nights as the weather is looking worse for tomorrow.  Flood watch, 1-2"" rain with thunderstorms, some could be severe.  Not the weather you want to have going up Mt Greylock.  So decided I'd take a zero tomorrow.
Made some good time to start even in the damp foggy conditions. Caught up to Norsemen and Billy Goat and chatted a while. While we were chatting I was reaching back to get some water and got distracted.  I hit my head on a fallen log across the trail.  I hit so hard that I chipped a tooth.  I didn't think much of it at the time but think I probably had a mild concussion.  Within the next half mile I slipped on a creek crossing and went in. Cut a finger, bruised my hands, and got my packed soaked. But worst of all I got my feet soaked, which I was really trying to avoid.  They were already a little tender from being wet the last two days. 
I stopped and Billy Goat help me clean and bandage my finger.  Then I put on a dry clean pair of socks, but since my shoes were soaked, they didn't stay dry for long.  Sat there for a bit and tried to get my bearings about me.  
Took things slower the rest of the day, but still fell a couple of times.  Then got a bug stuck under my eyelid the last 6 miles and couldn't get it out.  It was almost comical all the things that happened today.  But somehow, I still made it through.  Did the 20.6 miles to Dalton and got to the hotel at 3pm.  Checked in and got a shower and felt a bit better. After the shower my legs are so beat up I can't tell what is poison ivy, what are mosquito bites, and what is rash from my pants rubbing them. It's just nuts.   Feet are the real concern though and I'm hoping a day off will help. Tater and Squirrel got here and we did laundry and order Chinese.  Hope to get some sleep tonight and relax tomorrow.   
I'll be getting off the trail June 28 for a week to head back to Oregon.  I was asked to play a huge blues festival July 4 and didn't want to turn it down.  I haven't really played guitar or sang in 3 months, so hoping I can remember how to do it.  I'm aiming to get to Rutland/Killington June 27 then take the bus to Boston where I have plane ticket to Portland, OR.  That's the plan at least.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Tater, Squirrel and went and got something to eat up the street around 8.  It hadn't started raining yet and the updated forecast said it might not start til 3-4pm.  Which had all of us a bit upset and antsy.   A lot of the other hikers we knew took off toward Greylock when they saw it wasn't raining yet. 
Walked to the Post Office and got my packages from Vinegar and my friend Rebecca back home. Very excited!  Tater, Squirrel and I then took the bus to Walmart and picked up a few things.  Started to rain a bit then and we felt better about our decision to zero.  
Tater and I made another stop at Dicks to pick up fuel and got drenched waiting for the bus on the way back to the hotel.  We spend the rest of the day hanging out and watching progressively worse thunderstorms roll in. A couple of Severe Thunderstorm Warnings were issued.  Definitely made the right call staying put.

Was a nice cool morning but still humid after all the rain.  Had a nice climb up to Cheshire Cobble and hit my 900 mile mark...great place to hit it. Tater and I met up with Squirrel, Norsemen, Billy Goat, and Towlie there.  
We made the descent into Cheshire and stopped at a gas station/Dunkin Donuts and got some snacks.  After that we made the long but fairly gentle climb up to Mt Greylock, the highest peak in MA and the first 3000' peak since Virginia.  The climb was pretty easy, especially with half full packs.  The forest started to change around 3000' and saw a lot more pine and cedar...smelled wonderful.

Slept pretty well except for having strange dreams. A weird mix of music stuff and trail stuff...which is exactly what my life seems like right now with my shows coming up here shortly.  Got up around 5am and just was feeling down.  Feeling like I really don't fit in these days for some reason.  My friends on the trail are all great, but I still get bouts of being shy and anxious around groups of people when it doesn't have anything to do with music.  I didn't really want to bring anyone down so I took off ahead of them.  Left the hostel at 6:15am and had planned on doing 26 or so miles today.  
Beautiful morning leaving Greylock and got a few good pictures.  But shortly after I just was feeling sluggish, physically and mentally. Slowed my pace a bit and tried to enjoy the day the best I could. Things started getting really muddy a few miles in.  I hit the Vermont state line a little before noon and took a lunch break.  I had been looking forward to this day for years, finally getting into Vermont.  But once I was there, just seemed like another state on the trail.  I have now stepped foot in 49 states, with the only one I haven't been to being Alaska. 
The hiking today in and of itself wasn't bad.  A big descent, a couple modest climbs. But the mud made things a bit difficult to navigate at times and knew I wouldn't be able to hit 26 miles. So decided on Congdon Shelter at 20.4.  
It really was one of the most pleasant days weather wise I've had since I started.  Temps in the 60's, partly cloudy, and a nice breeze all day.  Passed a couple of beautiful ponds and a nice trailside creek.  And I did enjoy it the best I could.

Didn't sleep hardly at all last night.  Mind was racing, and combine that with my pillow missing, it made for a long night.  Rolled out of the tent at 5:30 and was out on the trail by 6:45am.  
Trail was a little bit better today, with not quite as much mud.  But still, where there was mud, it was impressive.  The biggest thing the last three days has been the black flies.  They are relentless.  And for those of you are are unfamiliar, they bite, and it hurts.  Had pulled my bug net out last night for the first time. 
Made really good time in the morning and wasn't really trying. 12 miles by noon.  The climbs in VT have been fairly gentle compared to other parts of the trail and it's been nice. Today marks 3 months since I started this journey in Georgia...it's still a bit surreal. I can't believe I'm still going after all I've been through. 
Not a lot of views or things to look at, just a quick 20 miles.

Didn't sleep at all again last night.  Was up in the loft in the shelter, and was really hot up there.  Had to stay in my bed because the bugs were so bad.  Still wound up getting bit somehow, ha.
Got up early caused I needed to get to the Post Office before noon and had 10.7 miles to go and had to get a hitch.  Was up at 4:45 and was on the trail at 5:25am.  It was pouring down rain when I left and the trail was a mess.  Deep mud and basically a river in some parts for the first 5 or so miles.  It was miserable but I made the best of it.  Almost reminded me of Oregon on my training hikes.  I had my frogg toggs pants on and gaiters cause I didn't want to get mud all over my legs if I was going to hitch.  Ended up making good time even in the mess. Got to the road before 10am.
Was getting ready to change into dry town clothes to try and hitch and someone was dropping off a hiker and offered to give me a ride.  So happy!!! She took me to the Post Office, and unfortunately my drop wasn't there.  So, she was nice enough to drop me off at the grocery store.  Again, super grateful.  By this time it had stopped raining and the sun was starting to come out. Turning into a really nice day.  
I resupplied at the store and cleaned out my bag and reorganized things. I walked up to the outfitter to get a new pillow and saw the other Tater sitting there (I think she is going to go by Blonde Tater since the Tater I had hiked with is shortly behind).  We chatted a bit and she offered me some goodies out of her drop box.  
Went in to the outfitter and got a new pillow and then walked up the street to the Thai place.  Been craving Thai food for months and it was amazing. After that, I walked to Ben and Jerrys and got ice cream and then over to Starbucks.  Felt so strange to be in all these places after being on the trail and in mud all morning.  Relaxed for a bit then called Jeff at Green Mountain House Hostel.  He picked me out and drove me out there and wow, what an awesome place.  It's basically a newly outfitted house that he turned into a hostel. Super clean, real mattresses, and even had a guitar.  So happy!Got cleaned up, did laundry and got to weigh myself. I've been so worried that I've lost a ton of weight.  I haven't.

Had one of the best views of my hike so far from the top of Bromley Mtn.  The trail follows a ski run so at the top there were 360 degree views. Just spectacular. 
The trail wasn't too muddy, and the bugs weren't too bad at all.  A couple more fairly easy climbs during the day that produced wonderful views.  Over all it really was one of the best hikes I've had since I started.  And that was even with my shoes and feet giving me problems.  I'm really hoping I can find something that will work better for me when I head back to Portland for a week.  Right now it feels like I have little gnomes hammering the back of my heels on every step.  It's almost comical at this point to me.  At least I can say I've gotten a lot better at handling pain through this hike.

Got up around 5:30 and got out of camp by 7:10.  Was a beautiful morning but pretty cool with a stiff wind.  Stayed in the 50's and low 60's most of the day.  Was feeling pretty sluggish all day and my feet were hurting a lot.  I switched out my insoles (I'm carrying three right now, ha) and it helped a little. Hit my 1000 mile mark about 10 am and didn't have anyone around to take my picture so I tried to do it on self timer.  It was right at an amazing cascading stream.  Perfect place for it.  The picture came out great, but I slipped hard on the rocks getting back out.  I guess I'll always look at that picture and laugh.  
Had a couple decent views today and I took them and tried to enjoy them.  Noticed the clouds were thickening at one of the overlooks around 1:30 and decided to put on my rain jacket and pack cover.  About 3pm it started raining, and then came a thunderstorm. My first of the trail. And it was nasty.  Heavy rain for a couple hours and temps fell into the low 50's.  I was really wishing I had put on my waterproof socks.  We'll see what the aftermath is.

Got up around 6 and was out on the trail a little after 7.  Was a nice but chilly morning.  Stared up Killington and wasn't too bad.  Made it up too the side trail to the summit and that was super steep, but was fun to climb. Great views from the top and I just sat there for a while and ate a snack.
Started feeling bad after that.  I think being in the cold rain yesterday got to me. It's weird, I've been in lots of cold rains on the trail the last 3 months and they haven't gotten to me.  And the one before I leave to go back to Portland to sing does, ha.  Oh well. 
The rest of the day terrain wise wasn't bad. But my feet were hurting horribly again. The last few hundred miles have been excruciating.  I've really got to figure something out when I'm back home for the week.  I still think it's my shoes, but maybe it's just my feet. 
Got to Mountain Meadow Lodge around 2pm.  Nice place by a lake.  Got checked in and cleaned up.  There was a guitar in the lounge area me practiced for a while.  Can tell I'm loosing my voice from the cold/rain.  Spent the rest of the afternoon just hanging out.  Tater and Towlie came by and are staying outside in the loft cause it's cheaper.

I quickly realized that my shoes options are becoming limited since I already tried many brands and styles.  Tried on a few pairs and decided on the Vasque Breeze.  Felt pretty good in the store, and its is probably the most vetted shoe out there. And I've seen a lot of them on the AT so far.  
I headed up the Columbia Gorge to do one of the more difficult hikes I could find, Dog Mountain.  3000' of elevation gain in a little over 3 miles.  I've done it twice before but this was the first time in the heat (86 degrees) and with a full pack.  Even with me being in the best condition in my life, this hike was difficult, and harder than any climb that I've done on the AT...yet.  
Unfortunately, the shoes started giving me blisters bad after only 2 miles in.  It was crazy.  Nothing has ever given me a blister that quickly.  I haven't had a blister on the trail in over 200 miles, my feet have over 1000 miles of trail on them, and couldn't believe the shoes gave me ones so quickly.  To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I feel like I'm going to loose my mind if I don't find something adequate soon.  I thought about turning around right then, but decided to put some moleskin on them and push on and get a workout in to keep my trail legs before the Whites.  It was a spectacular day in the gorge for hiking and the trail is like a manicured Parkway compared to the AT, ha.  
I'm going back to REI tomorrow and look again, but honestly I'm starting to run out of options.","Killington, VT

Got up this morning and went back to REI and returned the shoes and looked for some other ones.  This time I brought my buddy who is a shoe designer and has designed for all the major outdoor brands.  Tried on 7 different shoes and decided on La Sportiva.
Didn't feel much like hiking as I'd rather be visiting my friends and relaxing but I knew I had to try out the shoes. So, I picked the hike I've always been to scared to try. Munra Point.  It has an elevation gain of 2000' per mile, hand over foot climbing most of the way, and an unfortunate young woman fell last year during the hike and died. 
The first mile or so is flat, then it turns off the main trail and heads straight up.  The shoes were doing well at first then they started hitting my ankle and knee they weren't going to work.  But I couldn't worry about that during the hike cause I really had to focus.  It was definitely the hardest hike I've done climbing wise.  I just kept looking ahead and moving forward.  I managed to get close to the top and saw this ridiculous climb, where a girl was sitting at the top trying to get down.  There was a guy trying to help her and she was in tears.  I watched this for 20 minutes, knowing full well it could be my fate as well.  She finally got down and I climbed up and made it all the way to the top.  The view was absolutely spectacular.  Views of the whole Columbia Gorge and Mt Adams in the distance. Stayed for a moment then started back down.  Got to point where the girl was having the issue and just took my time and was fine.  
I had taken my pack up but only had about half the stuff in it.  Wanted the feel of the pack but didn't want to be foolish and endanger myself by having the extra weight.  
Made it down ok, but once again the shoes weren't going to work. Super bummed out and running out of options.  Not sure what I'm going to do.  Need to give it a break for a couple of days and concentrate on the reason why I'm in Portland, to play the big show.","Portland, OR - Dog Mountain

Had a great time in Portland, OR playing the Waterfront Blues Festival.  My band did a fantastic job, I still remembered how to play guitar, I got to see lots of friends, and the weather was amazing. I did think a lot about staying and quitting my hike.  With all the troubles I've had, and to have traveled the miles I have already, no one would have thought any less of me...except for me.  
Even after 9 days off the trail, my feet still hurt. As for the shoes, I decided to get another pair of Merrells.  I know the shoe well as I hiked 400 miles in my last pair from VA to NY.  However, it's the shoe I got trench foot and cellulitis in.  I can't believe I'm using that shoe, but nothing else came close to working...and I've tried 10 shoes so far. I'm hoping I've learned a lot more about how to take care of my feet and toes, especially in wet weather. 
Took the redeye from Portland to Boston and the flight wasn't too bad.  Got there around 7am and then took a bus to Hanover, NH.  I wanted to go through there to pick up a package as I'll be through there on Sunday and didn't want to have to waste a day.  Picked up some fuel in town as well and walked around Dartmouth a bit.  Beautiful old campus.  It was a little weird being in a place I'll pass again in 2 days, but it just worked out so much better logistically.  Hopped on the Vermont Transitlines bus to Killington at 2:50 and got to the Inn at the Long Trail at 4:15.  I had made an actual reservation and paid full price for the room and very glad that I did as they were sold out when I checked in. Great inn and very hike friendly.  Looking forward to to getting some sleep since I've been up basically for two days now.  
Now that I'm here...I'm glad I'm continuing on my adventure...","Portland, OR

Slept well at the Inn at Long Trail.  Had an amazing breakfast there too, that was included in the stay. Packed up and got a ride to the trail where I left off on June 27. 
Felt good to be back on the trail, but I was definitely sluggish and sore. There was quite a bit of elevation gain for the day which was a bit surprising. Even though I got a couple tough hikes up in Oregon, it still wasn't enough to keep my trail legs completely.
My feet started hurting a few miles in and am just coming to the realization that it's not the shoes...it's just my feet suck. The shoes did ok, and had some new insoles and I think they'll be ok.  The biggest pain I've been having lately is on the inside (not underneath) of both heals.  The best thing about my time off was getting to have a little break from the pain.  It took a while today to get used to my pain bubble again.  Hoping I'll feel better tomorrow.I stopped at Stony Brook Shelter for lunch and there was an abandon pack and stuff scattered everywhere, and no one in sight. Went to the privy and on the way saw a stove and it had bite marks in it.  Realized a bear had gotten into someone's stuff and they had left the scene. Freaky. Decided not to eat lunch there after all. 
I had planned on hiking to Winturri shelter, but got to Lookout Cabin and the view was so amazing I decided to stop.  Had the place to myself for a while then it filled up pretty quick.  
When I was in Hanover, I picked up my mail drop since I'd be there on Sunday.  The drop was from Mountain House and they sent me breakfast and dinner for 4 days.  A friend had sent them a message and picture of me with the meals and Mountain House contacted me and wanted to send me some.  Definitely one of the coolest things that's happened on the trail so far.","Killington, VT

Tough day.  Slept ok and got up around 5:30.  Ate some breakfast and was out on the trail around 6:45.  Felt pretty good to start the day.  Hiked 6.4 miles to VT Rt 12 where the On The Edge Farm is .2 off the trail. Got there around 9:30 and they were open early.  Had some amazing homemade Blueberry Sour Cherry pie.  
After I got back on the trail my right knee started hurting...bad.  It was the strangest thing.  Maybe I messed it up coming down the last hill or going up the first one back out.  Don't know how it happened but the pain was intense and had to stop a few times.  Tried to stretch and relax, and took some Advil but nothing helped it.  Don't think it's IT band stuff again as I know that pain well, and it hurts just as bad going up as going down. 
Needless to say, the last 8.5 miles of the day were brutal.  Just a test of wills.  Still had the heel pain on top of it too.  I'm beginning to feel like a boxer that has gotten hit too many times and doesn't have enough sense to throw in the towel when he's taking a beating. I'm just too stubborn I suppose.  I'll just keep pushing...
One good thing about the day.  It rained for a couple hours in the late morning and I put on my awesome rain gear that I brought back from Portland.  It weighs a little more, but so much happier.  
Got to the shelter around 3:30 and set up my tent.  Stretched a little bit and hope some rest will help things.  Heard some thunder in the distance and moved my pack and food into the shelter to wait out the storm.  Pole Runner and his dad were there and a few others started filtering in. 
Going to try and limp the 14.5 miles into Hanover and chill out a bit, then hit the shelter just outside of town.","Lookout Cabin

Much better day today.  Got up at 5:15 and stretched and ate some breakfast and got out on the trail at 6:30.  The trail was absolutely spectacular.  It was probably the best morning I've had since Virginia.  It was cool, and the forest floor was open and the grade was easy.  What a difference a day makes.  And my knee didn't really hurt at all today...just crazy. Maybe it was a holdover from sitting on planes/buses again.  
Made it into Hanover, NH around 1:30.  Wandered around town a bit, got some food and met up with Shivers at a coffee shop.  She was taking a zero and I hadn't seen her since NY.  Was great catching up with her for a while.  We had gotten connected on the trail through a mutual friend a while back...it's crazy how small a world it is at times.
Went by the Co-op and ate some food and resupplied.  And like usual, I have way too much food.  Sat there for a bit and talked to my mom and messaged some friends.  
Started back into the woods around 5 and made it to the shelter at 5:30.  Only other person there is a SOBO named Coo-Coo from Ashland, Oregon.   Sat around and chatted for quite a bit...was nice.
So my feet had gotten really wet from the rain yesterday and the leftover moisture today.  I did everything I could.  Stopped every 5 miles and let them air out, and changed my socks at 10 miles. The tops of my toes are starting to rub raw...which is super scary.  So afraid of getting cellulitis. Not exactly sure what to do as I can't tape them.  I had bought some more band aids in town and may try a few strategically placed ones tomorrow.  Not a good thing especially heading into the Whites in a few days.","Thistle Hill Shelter

Good, but hard day of hiking. Didn't sleep well at all. I guess I was too wired from being in town and thinking about my feet, and the White Mountains looming ahead in a couple days.
Got up at 5 and was out on the trail by 6:35.  Put some band aids on my toes and tried a couple other things trying to get the rubbing to stop.  Just think it's in the shoe design or something.  The shoes work pretty well...except for that.  So, I decided to have my brother send me the pair of Salomons that I ordered and never tried out.  They are more on the trail runner side of things.  I should get them in 3 days.  I'll just carry two pair of shoes for a while. I've done it before. 
Lots of climbing today on the trail. And actually according to my gps it was the most elevation gain of any day so far on the trail.  Couple of good views and I actually likes some climbing today despite my toes hurting. It was good to feel my trail legs coming back. 
Got to the shelter around 6:30 and was pretty worn out after 22 miles.  Going to rain tonight and tomorrow and hope I can make it through ok. Hope to do 20 miles to the hostel.","Velvet Rocks Shelter

Good day of hiking.  Didn't sleep too great in the shelter as it was cram packed. Got up at 5:30 and was out on the trail at 6:20.  Was raining a bit when I left the shelter and put on all my rain gear.  Ended up stopping mid morning and took it off around the top of Mt Cube.  Around then I hit my 1100 mile mark on the trail and am no over the halfway point. Still so hard to believe I've made it this far.  So grateful.  
Hiked off and on with Billy Goat most of the day.  19 year old college from Massachusetts.  Cool kid and has hiked most of the Whites already so a wealth of information.
Pushed it fairly hard most of the day and got to Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff, NH at 4pm.  Pretty cool place, and super busy.  Has bunks for 30 or so and was pretty full.  
Today was the first time I'd done back to back 20's since NJ, felt good. Tired but good.  
Shoes are still rubbing my toes and feet pretty good.  Very thankful that it hasn't rained that much and I've been able to keep them dry.  Tomorrow looks to be dry too, but it is my first climb in the White Mountains, Mt Moosilauke.  I've got it set up where I'm only doing 9.3 miles over it and then stay at the Notch Hostel tomorrow night and Thursday night and slackpack the 16 miles over a Kinsman.  A bit nervous but excited.","Smarts Mountain

Pretty good day.  Slept ok at Hikers Welcome Hostel and got up at 5:45.  Was out on the trail by 7:15.  Was a beautiful day with temps in the 70's and sunny for the most part.  Was excited and a bit nervous for my first climb of the Whites, Mt Moosilauke at 4800'. 
The climb wasn't too bad at all. Got to the top and it was absolutely amazing.  The last half mile was above tree line and the views just made everything worth it.  Ate lunch up there for about an hour and just soaked it in.
Started the descent about 11:15, and it was tough.  Very steep, very rocky, and very slippery.  Definitely one of the harder ones of the hike so far.  And I know ones coming up will be more difficult.  
Made it to the parking lot by 1:45 and waited for the hostel shuttle at 2:30.  Pretty easy day over all and my feet did ok, mostly due to the fact it wasn't raining. 
The Notch Hostel is one of the best ones on the AT. Super organized without feeling stuffy at all.  Very grateful I had called ahead and reserved a bunk for tonight and tomorrow because they are full.  The forecast calls for heavy rain and thunderstorms for tomorrow.  The plan was to slack pack 16 miles and come back and stay.  But if it is looking bad, I may take a zero and hike out on Friday with my full pack.  I learned today that the Whites are tough enough in dry weather. And it's not worth all the effort if you can't see anything at all from the top.","Glencliff, NH

Didn't sleep well last night at all in the hostel, so decided to take a zero.  It ended up taking a long time to cool off in the room and I just tossed and turned for a while. Rained really hard in the night, and ended up raining a good part of the morning.  So, I think it was the right call on the zero...especially being in the Whites.  The descents are tricky enough in dry weather, and it's a shame to do all that work and not get to see anything at all because you're in a cloud.  
Spent most of the day hanging out and relaxing in the hostel.  Really cool place and enjoyed chatting with some fellow hikers.  Most of them are SOBO's as it seems we'll be going through their bubble for a bit. 
Not sure if I can slackpack tomorrow as the hostel is full.  So it looks like I'll be hiking out tomorrow to do Kinsman.  I'll either do 10 miles to the shelter, or 13 to the hut and see if I can do a work for stay. ","North Woodstock, NH

Took a while to get to sleep last night but slept ok when I finally did.  Got up around 5:45 at the hostel and went upstairs and fixed some pancakes.  Really enjoyed my stay at the Notch, wonderful place.  Got all my gear packed up and the shuttle took us up to the trail at 7:30.  Was out on the trail by 7:45am and I was about the only one was wasn't slackpacking.  I carried my full back as the hostel was full and couldn't stay there tonight.
It was cloudy and drizzly with temps in the 50's all day.  No views at all from Kinsman because of the mist.  Did get to see some water falls along the way though.  The hiking was slow going because of the steepness of the trail, and because the rocks and roots everywhere. Everything was super slick and just had to take my time.  My new shoes felt great to begin with but after about 7 miles, my heels really began to hurt bad and I had to switch shoes. Super bummed as I really liked them.
The hiking wasn't really all that difficult today...just slower and more tedious than normal.  I was patient and enjoyed the hike today, even though there were no views.
Passed by the Lonesome Lake Hut at 4:15 and asked about Work For Stay and they said I was the first one there and that would take me.  Very excited as I smelled the food from up the trail.  So basically I do a couple hours of work this evening (cleaning up, washing dishes, etc), and I get a meal and can sleep on the floor in the kitchen.

Last night I was at Lonesome Lake Hut and the crop there was awesome.  2 other work for stays there and we all got feed very well.  Pork stew, baked chicken, salad, broccoli, mashed potatoes, and bread. So good!!  Did the dishes and was in my sleeping bag by 9:40.  Slept well, except for an intense thunderstorm in the middle of the night. Very grateful to be indoors!
Got up at 5:15 and was out on the trail by 6am.  Was cloudy and raining when I set out.  Was praying it would clear up a bit before I hit Mt Lincoln and Lafayette.  Saw a little sun for a second then it disappeared. The climb up wasn't bad at all.  When I got to the top it was totally encased in a cloud. Bummer. But as I've said before, I really wasn't doing this for the views.  They are just an added bonus when they happen.  
Started down Lafayette and about 100 yards from the tree line, the clouds broke and gave me some spectacular views.  The clouds rolling over head made it extra special. 
After that the sun was out for a while but I was down below tree line.  The hiking was tedious, but not difficult. Was trying to push to Galehead Hut for another work for stay if possible.  Started raining hard about a mile and half before the Hut which of course made the descent down Garfield interesting, ha. Wore the Salomons all day and they actually did ok. A little heel pain but not horrible.  I did notice I have lost my first toenail though. Figured it was going to happen sooner or later. 
Made it to the Hut about 4:30...16 miles.  Not bad for quitting early. And was able to get another work for stay.  So happy!  Resting up now and enjoying the spectacular view before dinner and my chores. ","Lonesome Lake Hut

Got up around 5:15 and was on the trail by 6am.  It was an absolutely gorgeous morning. Clear skies and temps in the 50's.  Started the day by heading up South Twin Mtn and the view from the top is one of the best I've seen on the whole trail.  I could see Mt Washington in the distance, presiding over the rest of the mountains in all it's glory.  I stayed up on top there for a good long while just taking it all in.  It's view like that which make all the miles in the rain, mud, and rocks worth it.   
I decided that I was going to try and summit Washington on the clearest day I could manage.  And with storms predicted the next couple days that means slowing down a lot. The next relatively dry day looks to be Wednesday.  I could have summited tomorrow but decided why rush things.  This is the most spectacular part of my hike so far and I just want to soak it all in.  
So, decided just to do 11.8 today, which is still a respectable number in the Whites.  Had some great views from Guyout and Zeacliff, and just took my time all day.  Stopped by Zealand Falls Shelter and got some leftover breakfast and some soup. Made it over to Ethan Pond Shelter around 2:30pm.  It's the earliest I've ever gotten to a shelter, and felt weird to be stopping, but I know I'll be grateful that I took my time and tried to find a good window for Washington.

The 3 miles down to the road were pretty easy...kinda reminded me of Virginia a bit.  When I got close to the road I hear voice yell 'Tornado' and I see Towlie by his tent setup off the trail. Was great to see him!  Chatted with home for a while then headed down to the parking lot where I saw Ant Man, Norsemen, and Tater.  Didn't think I'd see them as they had been off doing 4K's of trail, and last I had seen their names in the logs they were a couple days ahead.  I hadn't seen Ant Man since NJ I think and was awesome to see him.  We talked a long time and then Towlie came down and the 3 of us headed up Mt Webster while Norsemen and Tater took his truck up to the AMC center to drop of trash and such. Norsemen had gone and gotten his truck in TX while I was off trail and he and Tater are doing the rest of the 4 thousand foot peaks in NH in addition to the trail. 
Had a great time hiking with Towlie and Ant Man, and we took our time and had a blast.  Some pretty tough climbing but some spectacular views of Crawford Notch to the west and Mt Washington to the NE.  Made it over to Nauman Tentsite around 2:30 and set up our tents on a pad.  Got some soup and some bread at the Mitzpah Hut and hung out there for a bit.  Tater and Norsemen showed up around 4:30 and got a work for stay.

Decided to hike with Ant Man and Towelie for most of the day.  Planning on a short day to Lake of the Clouds Hut or summit Washington if the weather turned nice.
Waited around for leftover breakfast at 8 and didn't get out of camp til 9:45.  Was in and out of the clouds for a while and went over Pierce, Eisenhower, and Monroe. Hiking above tree line for that long was amazing and something I'll remember for the rest of my life. The clouds started opening up around Washington and decided to make a run for the top.  Stopped by the Hut and they said we could do a work for stay. Left some weight at the Hut and pretty much sprinted up to the top.
The ascent was fairly easy and made it to the top and it was just amazing...I almost cried.  So the story of that summit is interesting for me.  22 years ago my girlfriend and I drove to the top on a cloudy, drizzly day.  I saw a dreary hiker emerge from the fog and I said to her, ""That's crazy. I will never do that"". How times have changed.  I'm so grateful to have made it to the top, and to have made it this far in my journey.  
We took our pics at the top and went into the visitor center. Chatted with the lady there and told her I had a degree in Meteorology and she arranged for a private tour of the weather station.  It was so cool!!!  Got to go up top to where they take the observations...one of the last places around that machines don't do that.  Very grateful.

Hardly a cloud in the sky and we had the summit to ourselves.  Which was a total contrast to the previous day as it was mobbed by hundreds of tourists on the top.  
Took our time hiking down and just enjoyed the views above tree line. So lucky to have been able to summit Washington twice in good weather. 
Stopped by Madison Springs Hut and got a little something to eat.  Saw Tater and chatted for a bit and Ant Man hiked on.
The ascent and descent down Madison wasn't as horrible as the SOBO's had made it out to be.  Pretty rocky but was ok if you took your time.
After the trail got below tree line it was actually pretty pleasant. Rinsed off a little in a creek and enjoyed the flatter, less rocky trail.

Was up around 6:30 and ate breakfast.  Had a hard time deciding whether to take a zero or not. Tater, Norsemen, and Towelie were taking zeros and although it would have been nice to hang with them and my body needed the rest, the weather was nice and I decided to hike out.  Couldn't bring myself to tell them goodbye as I knew it was probably the last time I'd see them....I'm horrible as goodbyes.  So, I snuck out around 8ams hit the trail.
I had originally thought about trying 16.7 miles since I got a late start.  But once I got going my legs felt strong, even with the 5 days of food in my pack. So I decided to aim for 21.2...which is not an easy thing in the Whites/Southern Maine.
Felt good for the first 5 or so miles them my heels really started to hurt. I kinda just dealt with the pain and pushed on the best I could.  The trail wasn't as difficult as the Whites, but there were a lot of ups and downs.  A lot.  
Had some really nice views throughout the day that made the hiking more enjoyable.  And about 16 miles in I crossed into Maine...still can't believe I've made it this far.  Pushed on to the shelter and made it there by 7:30. I checked the pedometer/elevation gain for the day on my phone and it was by far the most elevation I had done on any day...by a significant amount.  Crazy.
Hope to get some sleep...Mahoosuc Notch and Arm are up first thing in the morning.","Shelburne l, NH

Slept pretty well in the shelter and got up around 5:30.  Was a nice morning and was out on the trail by 6:15.
I got to Mahoosuc Notch around 7:15 and was really excited to go through it. It was so much fun!  Put my poles up and just climbed and crawled. There was a little spot in there that still had some snow/ice underneath it.  Crazy. Got through the Notch in little over and hour.  After that was Mahoosuc Arm which is a super steep climb that the SOBO's have been telling me about. I set a good steady pace and got up it pretty easily.  
Had a couple more big climbs with Old Speck and Baldplate.  Baldplate was pretty steep and open climbing up, but the views were spectacular. So glad I've been pushing myself the last few days as the weather has been great. Would really not have wanted to do any of today in the rain. And speaking of rain, it is supposed to rain the next couple of days.  Kinda anxious to see what the hiking/climbing is going to be like. ","Full Goose Shelter

Slept pretty good in my tent.  Only the second time in 2 weeks I've been in it. Got up around 5:30 and was out on the trail by 6:30.  Was expecting rain early in the morning but it held off...for a little while.
The morning hike was great.  Nice and cool under cloudy skies, with a gentle breeze.  Perfect hiking weather.  And the terrain wasn't too bad either.  The first 5 miles or so reminded of parts of Virginia.  Not a lot of rocks and moderate grades.  Nice change of pace.
Rained started around 11am and got heavier as the day progressed.  Once again, super happy I have my good rain gear now. But I realized I've lost my pack cover somewhere, which bummed me out.  My things stayed dry as everything is in separate dry bags(sleeping bag, clothes, food, and toiletries, etc). But my pack is pretty soaked.  Going to try and get a cover in Rangeley at the outfitter along with a few other things.  The bottom part of one of my poles snapped a 100 miles ago and the leather strap to one of my gaiters ripped.
Got to the campsite at 3 and set up my tent.  It was the first time I'd set it up in the rain and I managed to keep everything dry.  I'm all nice and cozy in my tent and I'm going to eat a lot as I think I have some extra food.  Planning on 17 miles tomorrow and then a 9 mile nero to Rangeley on Wednesday. ","Frye Notch Lean To

Rained more in the night, but I slept pretty good.  Got up at 5:30 and took a little while to pack everything up because it was wet. Took my time and had a nice morning and was on the trail by 7am.
Was cloudy and cool with a little rain to start and I didn't mind to begin with.  The trail was quiet and rather peaceful. The higher up the trail got, the rockier and wetter it got.  And subsequently slicker.  So, not a real fun day.  Nothing was exceptionally difficult but the hiking was very tedious and a bit treacherous at times. I couldn't take my eye off the trail once all day or I'd slip or trip.  It was rather exhausting.
The clouds started to clear out in the afternoon and made things a bit better.  But the highlight of the day was some trail magic at a dirt road crossing provided by Snowman and Teddy.  They had hamburgers and hot dogs, soda, and chips.  It couldn't have been better timing for me and it was amazing!  They've been doing trail magic every Tuesday and Thursday for the past 3 years, and they drive 70 miles one way to do it.  I'm so grateful for them as they really turned my around.  I had 3 hot dogs a hamburger, soda and chips.
The trail the rest of the day was a bit easier but still tedious.  Got to the shelter around 6:30 and it was a zoo.  Two groups of teens, probably 30 of them took up the tent sites and the shelter was packed with thru hikers.  Luckily I found a little spot beside the shelter to set up my tent.  Had a blast chatting with the thru hikers after dinner. 
Hoping to get into Rangeley early tomorrow and get my mail drop I sent.  Where I had it sent, the Farmhouse, is full with a wedding and supposedly is sending my package to the Hiker Hut.  Hope I can find it and get into to town and get some things at the outfitter.","Black Brook Campsite

Slept pretty good in the tent again and was up by 5:30. Didn't want to get up this morning and was feeling cozy in my bag. And I'm a little sore from the last few days.  Nothing major but I haven't taken a zero in two weeks and can tell a bit.  Glad today is a nero of sorts...only 9.4 miles.
Got out of camp by 6:45 and made good time for most of the morning.  Was nice and cool and quiet and enjoyed the hiking for the most part.  No big ups or downs, but there was still a fair deal of mud and roots...but hey, this is Maine :-)
Got to ME 4 at 10:50 and walked the .3 miles to the Hiker Hut.  Was greater by Steve the owner upon my arrival.  What a great place!!  Flowers and herbs everywhere and right beside a river.  Just beautiful. It's totally off the grid (no power, etc) which is kinda cool.  He has a nice guitar there too (A Seagull...the nicest I've seen on trail by far!) and I just sat and played for an hour.  
Got shuttled into town and picked up a pack cover and hopefully a pole tip that might work. Ate some Thai food, got some fudge and just relaxing a bit.

Got to bed pretty late last night, 10:45, as I was playing guitar and singing around the fire.  Stars came out and was a beautiful night.  Woke up at 4:45 to some rain and given the forecast I had seen yesterday (there is no cell service at the hostel) thunderstorms were supposed to happen in the afternoon.
So, I reluctantly decided to take a zero.  Of course it stopped raining around 8am, but I know my body probably needed a break.  Still might storm later and definitely didn't want to be up on Saddleback during a storm. Been 2 weeks without a zero and I've been putting in 11-12 hour hiking days for the last week over rough terrain.  And if I was going to take a zero, this was the place.  Really enjoying the Hiker Hut and the town of Rangeley.

Got back out on the trail today. Had a wonderful two days in Rangeley.  Made some new friends and had a lot of fun.  Ever since I've been back on the trail after my gig on July 4, things have been a lot different.  The trail has been what I hoped it would be.  Exciting, challenging, beautiful, full of adventure, fun, and I've meet so many amazing people.  Even if some of them I've only talked to one evening.  Feeling very blessed right now. 
Took my time saying goodbye to my new friends and didn't get out on the trail til about 9am.  It was a gorgeous day, clear with temps in the upper 60's.
The big climb was Saddleback Mountain and it really wasn't too bad.  The top had a 3 mile section above tree line and was so grateful for a beautiful day.  Views for miles in every direction and I just walked around in awe and with a smile on my face.
A couple little more climbs over The Horn and Saddleback Junior and that was it for the elevation.  A lot of climbing for the day by the numbers but it didn't feel like it.
Made good time and was able to do 18.7 to Spaulding Mountain Lean To by 7:30.  No tent space available but was able to get a spot in the shelter.  Hope to get some sleep and get out early in the morning. ","Rangeley

Took my time going up and down the rest of the peaks as some parts were a bit tedious.  Was making slow time until I got down and thonged flattened out.  Then it was a bit surreal for a while.  Nice flat trail...I had almost forgotten how to actually hike.  
Decided to push it a bit and see what I had in the tank and what kinda speed I could do.  For the last couple hours I was doing 3 miles an hour so felt good about that.  
Got to the shelter at 4:25 and found a really nice tent site.  Set up camp and then went down by the pond and got water and rinsed and soaked my feet.  Felt wonderful.

Got up at 5:15 and planned to be out on the trail by 6am.  But I headed downstairs and the breakfast Paul was preparing looked and smelled amazing. So I had to stick around.  Omelette with broccoli cheese and onions, homemade blueberry muffins, bacon, home fries, French toast, fruit, and juice. Definitely worth the time to stay.  
Got out on the trail at 7:15 and it was one of the most beautiful mornings for an hour or so I've had on the trail.

Was a pretty nice morning and I took my time hiking the 9 miles into Monson.  Passed a couple of nice lakes and over the Piscataquis River.  That was supposed to be a ford but managed to rock hop my way across.  There have been 4 fords so far and I've been able to rock hop them all.  With rain coming, don't think I'll be able to do that for too much longer.
Got to the trailhead around 10:30am and called Shaws and they came and picked me up.  Got there and it was already full of hikers.  Got my resupply box from my friend Dave and got it organized for the wilderness. 
Walked into town, got some food and ice cream and some snacks.  Place is packed with hikers. Probably 50-60 NOBO's.  There are a couple of different groups and it's like I went smack dab head first into a huge bubble.  It's going to tough finding my space in the Wilderness. We'll see.

Didn't sleep hardly at all last night.  Really warm upstairs at the hostel and lots of people coming in and out.  Was up at 5 and couldn't go back to sleep and just laid there for a bit.  Would have liked to have gotten on the trail early but the first shuttle wasn't until 8:30.  So I went down and had the legendary Shaws breakfast at 7. 3 Eggs, potatoes, bacon, juice and all the blueberry pancakes you can eat.  Really good. 
Got the first shuttle and was out on the trail by 8:45. Really put me behind if I wanted to make good miles...but I was going to try.  Dancing Bear and Young Giraffe were the only two NOBOS who had caught that shuttle with me.  I've hiked on off with them for a few days and there good guys.  The big huge bubble at the hostel evidently had a bit too much fun last night and was slow to get out.  I like a lot of them but am hoping to be able to stay ahead of them so I can have tent/shelter space.
The trail was wet, muddy, rooty, and rocky...pretty much everything thing I expected from the 100 mile wilderness.  It was tedious all day and no real easy sections.  Lots of little ups and downs, and did have to ford streams twice which was actually pretty fun.  Had a little thunderstorm around 3 for a half an hour that made everything more slippery and muddy. 
Was worn out by 5 when I stopped at a shelter after 15 miles to take a little break.

Got my first view of Katahdin about 2 miles in from Nesuntabunt Mountain. Spectacular, but daunting.  It's one big, steep mountain. The trail was very trying today.  First 7 or so miles, roots and rocks.  Then the next 10 were a straight up swamp.  It made Vermud look like the Sahara.  My feet were muddy and soaked all day.  I don't know if it was miserable because I was just worn out, or if the trail was actually that bad.  I tend to think the later.

I made it.  Although it's not the end of my journey, I've hiked over 1500 miles, and conquered one of my biggest fears/obstacles.  Katahdin had always scared me.  I've seen pictures of the climb, heard stories about how tough it was (mainly from SOBO's), etc.  I've been terrified of heights my whole life so part of the reason I wanted to hike the AT was to try and conquer some of that fear. And today was a huge step.
I slept ok, and got up around 4:50. Was packed up and out on the trail by 6am.  Was a cool partly cloudy morning and was a perfect start to the hike.  It wasn't too difficult to begin with as most people had said, but by the third mile the rock climbing began.  I was a little anxious at first just because I didn't know what to expect. But honestly, it wasn't that bad at all.  I kind of enjoyed the climbing.
Made pretty good time and got up to the summit around 9:15 or so.  When my hand touched that sign, I did start to tear up a little.  It's been a wonderful, but difficult journey, and am so grateful to have made it this far.  
Tug Boat and Hoochie Mama were there and Train Wreck was shortly behind me.  We all got our pictures and enjoyed the summit for a little bit.  But headed back down shortly thereafter because it was foggy, windy, and cold.
Decided to go down the Abol Trail, and it wasn't bad at all. Made it to the parking lot at Abol Campground by 12:15 and Tug Boat's parents gave me a ride over to Katahdin Stream Campground where a friend picked me up.

After 3 weeks off, I'm heading back down to Neels Gap, GA to resume my NOBO hike. The time off has been a lot more difficult than I had thought, physically and emotionally.  I was hoping my body would heal up some and it seems like it aches more than when I got off the trail 3 weeks ago. My feet, my knees, and my hips.  I'm learning time and time again that my body doesn't like having the time off.  It like the nearo or zero here or there, but nothing much more than that.  I was also hoping to escape some of the heat in Georgia by delaying things a bit, which it does seem like it has cooled off. I'll find out very shortly if the break was a big mistake or not. 
I already gained 15 pounds since Katahdin, and most of that was in the first week.  Just crazy.   And all the social ad public interactions I've been having have been quite overwhelming as well.  I didn't think much of it at first and seemed to reacclimate ok, but as time has worn on, it's been a struggle.  I think not having a home per se to come back to has played a part.  Everytime I mention my backpack lately, I have been referring to it as ""my home"". I'm half joking and half not.  
I'm heading up to Northern Virginia tonight and fly out of Dulles to Atlanta in the morning.  I have one of my old band mates picking me up and is very graciously driving me to Neels Gap where I will resume my hike.  It is the point at which I got of the trail on March 26 when I tore the tendon in my foot.

Didn't get hardly any sleep last night.  Was a really tough day of travel, and so many emotions going through me.  Got out of the hotel this morning around 9 and dropped off the rental car and headed to Dulles.  The toughest part of the day was saying goodbye to my girlfriend. We planned to fly out of the same airport at the same time as we departed for our separate journeys. Me off to hopefully finish my thru hike and she off to Vietnam to teach for a year.  Hoping to reconnect again during and after our adventures.  
I flew from Dulles to Atlanta and got there a little before 3.  Took the MARTA to the REI on Perimeter, got some fuel, and one of my old band mates met me there.  He was kind enough to drive me all the way up to Neels Gap.  
Fought the typical Atlanta traffic and got there around 6:30.  I had a lot emotions pulling up to Mountain Crossings.  It felt like I was just there.  I remember so vividly the pain in my foot, and the immense fear of thinking my hike was over just before it had begun. I'll never forget what another hiker told me in the hostel that morning when I was debating what to do.  He said ""Get off the trail and take care of yourself.  The trail will always be here"". So incredibly grateful things worked out as they did. I was patient and let things heal, got to hike 1514 miles of the AT, met some incredible people, and missed a big part of that bubble I was in when I started.  
I reorganized my pack from the flight, filled up with water, and hiked a little ways up the trail and found a nice place to set up camp.  Hope to get a good nights sleep, and try and take it fairly easy tomorrow.  I've been pretty sedentary since Aug 9, so I'm sure I'm going to have to get my trail legs back.","Dulles, Virginia

Went to bed last night around 8:30 and slept really well.  The first time in a couple of weeks.  Got up around 5:30 and it was pitch black...was weird.  I'm used to being up north and having the sun up earlier.  Fixed some breakfast and was out on the trail by 6:45 and it was still dark.
Started hiking and had to used my headlamp for the first time on the trail.  Was a nice morning with temps in the 50's.  The weather is looking great for the next few days and I'm thinking I made the right choice in holding off starting the last leg.  Doesn't look to get above 80 all week. 
The trail itself was amazing most of the day.  It was like a freeway compared to what I had been dealing with in NH and Maine.  Had some ups and downs but nothing too bad.  Felt pretty out of shape though since I'd been off the trail 3 and half weeks, and have gained 17 pounds in that time.  Got the usual aches and pains but my knees seem to be the worst of it right now.  I think the Whites really did a number on them. I know I'm gonna be sore for a bit starting up again, but hoping everything loosens up a bit.  With all that, still managed to hike 22.6 miles today.  Kinda crazy.  I think I may just do 15 tomorrow and stay at Top of Georgia hostel as I have a package there.  
Set up camp at a nice site atop Rocky Mountain. Should be nice and cool up here and hope to get some sleep again.","Neels Gap

Slept pretty good last night and got up around 6.  Didn't get out on the trail until about 7:25.  Was another beautiful morning with cool temps and clear skies.  Was really sore and my knees were hurting pretty bad all day. I'm hoping to just hike through it til it gets better like I have with most of my other pains. But it's pretty bad...like the second or third most painful day I've had on the trail. I think it's a thing of me being off the trail for too long.  My body has shown me time and time again it doesn't like to be idle and I'm definitely paying for it.  
I'm pretty sure it's my IT Band again that's causing them knee pain.  It happened in Vermont the first couple days back on the trail after being off in Portland for 9 days.  I ended up just hiking through it then and it for Bette r in 4-5 days.  Hoping the same thing will be he case this time. 
Still, somehow I managed to push through and hike another 20 miles and made decent time.  The trail wasn't too difficult, lots of little ups and downs, and did hike over Tray Mtn, but it wasn't bad. About 15 miles in I road walked down to Top Of Georgia Hostel where I had a drop sent.  Really cool place and sat and chatted with Bob the owner for a good while.  Made it up to the shelter by 6pm and there were a few other people there but not crowded at all.  Nice to see a bear box again!  
Hoping to get some sleep, and really hoping my knee feels better in the morning.","Rocky Mountain

Slept ok last night and got up around 5:15. Still trying to get used to it being pitch black at that time.  Was out on the trail at 6:35 and had to used my headlamp again.  My knees hurt pretty badly when I woke up but after a couple miles they lossened up a little.  The pain is still there but definitely not as bad as yesterday, which I'm very grateful for. 
Was another spectacular morning.  A bit warmer and more humid, but still nice.  Crossed the NC/GA border about 4 miles in and was really excited.  It has taken me over 5 months to complete the GA section of the trail and there were some days I was unsure if I'd ever make it back.  A good reminder for me just to keep pushing the best I can.  
Some pretty good ups and downs to start the day, and the trail was getting more rocky and rooty.  The biggest climb was Standind Indian Mountain at around 5400'.  It's crazy the difference between that and 5400' in the Whites.  
Felt a bit sluggish and worn out all day for some reason.  Not exactly sure why.  Still managed almost 20 miles again and was in camp by 4:30, so I guess not too bad.  I'm the only one here as of yet at the shelter and it's so strange not having anyone around.  I knew it was going to be like this for me, but still taking a bit to get used to.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Didn't sleep well at all last night.  So many things going through my mind, was tough.  Laid around until 6:30 and got up and on the trail by 7:25.  Was another great morning but had some clouds starting to roll in.  Could tell there was going to be some weather later on.
My knees didn't hurt quite as bad again today, which I'm super grateful for.  However I'm having some issues with some muscles/tendons on the top of my left foot that are really painful.  If it's not one thing, it's another, ha.  I'm getting good pushing through the pain again and just hiked through it the best I could.  
The trail was really easy today with only one decent climb, Mt Albert, and it wasn't that bad.  And I ran into my first SOBO today! His name was Robert and he started at Katahdin on June 4.  He will finish in under 100 days.  Just crazy.  I chatted with him a while and was nice getting to talk thru hiker stuff with somebody.  He was the only person I saw all day. 
Made really good time in spite of things and got to Winding Stair Gap by 1:45pm.  One of my friend's brother lives in Franklin, NC and he was kind enough to pick me up and shuttle me a couple of places around town.  Trying to take care of some travel plans and logistics for a trip in November.  A lot more complicated and involved than I thought so I ended up just staying in town so I can finish it up in the morning.  Got a room at the Budget Inn and kinda grateful now it all worked out like this cause we had some big storms roll in this evening.","Carter Gap Shelter

Had a good day.  Didn't get to sleep til 11:30 last night as I was working on some travel plans for the fall.  Slept ok and got up around 6:30.  Hung around the hotel and got to talk to some people on the phone, which was really nice.  Scheduled a shuttle for 9am (only $3!) and was out on the trail at 9:20.  Was pretty late for me but was worth it just to relax a bit.  
It was pouring down rain when I started. Really really happy to have my good rain gear now.  Since I started back up in GA, I've been carrying two pairs of shoes.  The Salomon Odyssey Pros that hiked the last 400 miles in NH and ME.  They are great and haven't had any problems with them.  I brought along my Nike Wildhorse 3 GTX because I thought I might need them for rain from Harvey since they are Gore-Tex. Didn't need them for that but I've been hiking in them since I started back (100 miles) and they are doing pretty well.  They are the shoes I would have started my hike with but didn't want to bring waterproof shoes, so I left them at home and opted for the non waterproof version.  Which, as some may recall, didn't work for me mainly because they were too big.  These are a half size smaller and got much better.  They worked great today in the rain, and it looks like Irma may be heading my way over the weekend so I'm really glad I have them now.  I'll hold on to the Salomons for a bit just to make sure nothing weird happens with my feet (which is usually the case)
Made good time all day and it stopped raining around noon.  Passed over 4 balds (Siler, Wayah, Rocky, and Wesser) and took the side trails and the views were spectacular.  Besides the trail being a river for a good chunk of the day, and lots of ups and downs, the terrain wasn't too bad.  Only saw one other person hiking again today.  Made it to camp around 7:15 and set up my tent.  There were a couple other tents set up (one was in the shelter...ugh), but everyone was inside already.  Sitting here making my dinner and preparing for a cool night.  Supposed to have record lows with temps in the 30's.

Pretty good but long day.  Slept fairly well and was up at 5:45. Got packed up and was out on the trail by 6:45.  Was a gorgeous morning as I did a Ridge walk for the first mile or so.  Watched the sunrise and was above the fog that had settled in the valleys.  
Made it in NOC by 9:15 and got a few things at the store and outfitter.  Talked to friends and family on the phone and got everything charged up.  Left there at 11am and made the 3300' ascent up Cheoah Bald.  It was one of the longer climbs I've had on the trail. I made really good time but it definitely wore me out. 
Knees and feet felt ok for most of the day...just some of the usual soreness and aches from walking 20 mile days.
Weather stayed nice all day with temps in the 50's-60's. Keeping my eye on Irma.  Hoping to get through the Smokies before it hits. 
Didn't see hardly anyone again all day but got into camp at 6:30 and the shelter was packed.  7-8 tents and fortunately I was able to get a spot in the shelter.  Was weird seeing so many people after being mainly alone for a week.

Long strange day as I made it into the Smokies.  Slept ok in the shelter and got up around 5:30.  Was out on the trail by 6:15.  Starting to really like that time of morning as I've seen some spectacular sunrises. 
Made really good time, and got to Fontana dam marina around 11 AM. There is a phone there that you are supposed to be able to call a shuttle from, but the phone didn't work. So, it was a 2 1/2 mile Road walk into Fontana Village. I was attempting to hitchhike all the way, and about halfway down a guy in a truck let me in a couple others get in the back and gave us a ride. Very grateful for that.
Walked up to Fontana Lodge and got my dropbox that my friend David from back home sent me. He always sends great stuff. Walk down to the post office and mailed back my Solomons. I've been wearing the Nikes almost exclusively since I started, and with the rain and hurricane coming, I figured I would be using them anyway. 
I found the shuttle, and was able to get a ride back to the trailhead around 2 PM. I saw the Fontana Hilton shelter and checked it out, It looked pretty cool. I kept walking and stopped at the Fontana dam visitor center, where they had a shower available. One of the best showers I've had on the trail!
I left the visitor center about 330 and planned to stay at a campsite about 6 miles up the trail, making it about a 20 mile day. I got there at 5:45, and there is a sign they are saying that the campsite was closed due to an aggressive bear. I was not happy at all, as I was already exhausted. I really wish they had posted that down at the visitor center so I could've just stay down there. So, I had to push on another 5.2 miles to the next shelter. I got in around 730 and quickly got water, made dinner, set up my sleeping bag, and then hung my food. I'm the only one in the shelter tonight, and it looks like it's going to be a cold evening.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Slept ok, not too cold and no bears. Kinda slept in a got up around 6am. Fixed breakfast and got out on the trail by 7:15. Was a nice cool morning and the first few miles weren't too bad then the trail got pretty rocky.  Lots of little ups and downs that weren't too much fun and slowed me down a bit. 
Had hoped to get in another 25 miles but my feet were sore and still feeling a bit sluggish from yesterday.  Decided just to go for 20.  Not a lot of views today.
Ran into a couple of nice park rangers and chatted with them a bit.  They were out warning everyone about hurricane Irma and strongly advising people to be out of the park by Monday morning.  So, I have some decisions to make.  My plan had been to do 25 tomorrow and then 18 on Monday to get to Standing Bear Hostel around 2-3.  It might be pushing it.  I will go up Clingmans Dome in the morning and see if I can get an updated forecast.  If it looks really bad, then I will get out of the park tomorrow via 441 and see about getting a hotel room in Gatlinburg for a few days til things settle down.  ","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Kinda frustrating day but just taking it as part of my journey.  Got up late as it was cold and I was nice and warm in my quilt.  Rolled out of bed at 6:45 and was on the trail at 7:30.  After speaking with the Rangers last night, and thinking more about it, I was really leaning towards getting off the trail for a couple days to duck the hurricane. My biggest concern (and seconded by the rangers) was lots of rain plus strong winds equals downed trees.   Was going make my decision when I got to Clingmans Dome and see if I could get some cell signal and updated forecast.
Got to Clingmans around 8:45 and I was the only one there. Kinda eerie.   The busiest National Park in the country and it was empty. Evidently they had closed the road up there due to the incoming hurricane tomorrow.  For now, the skies were clear and the weather was perfect.  I had heard rumors that the tower was closed for repairs when I got there there were no signs and it seemed to be opened. So I walked up it.  It is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail at 6643'.  Very cool.
I tried to check the weather and didn't have a signal.  I could see some high clouds way off in the distance to the S but nothing impressive.  It was really clear which is rare up there.  My gut said to keep hiking but my brain said to err on the side of caution and get off the trail and head for Gatlinburg.  I ran into a hiker heading south (very strange man) who said he wanted to go into town but had heard it was a zoo down there and all the hotels were booked. And the few rooms available were around $180.  Not good news. He was just going to get to a shelter and bunker down for a couple of days.  I thought about that too, as I have plenty of food, but stuck to my plan. 
So I hiked the 10.4 miles to Newfound Gap and a couple of nice ladies that were section hiking gave me a ride into Gatlinburg. And let me tell you, it is not a good place for a thru Hiker to be.  Everything I don't like about society is here.  Nonetheless I got a fairly cheap room.
I checked the weather when I got into town and Irma's forecast track has changed.  It won't be going over the mountains and will be going farther west. Only supposed to get .5-.75"" of rain and 20-30mph winds.  Not happy...should have trusted my gut.  It's all a part of this crazy journey I guess. Now to go wander the carnival that is Gatlinburg.","Double Springs Gap Shelter

Got a good nights sleep and glad I took the day off.  It didn't rain nearly as much as they had predicted and definitely could have hiked.  But it was rainy, and cold, and I was pretty worn out and needed the rest.
I weighed myself and have lost about 15 pounds since I got back on the trail.  Not a good thing.  I had put on 17 when I got off for the three weeks so I'm back to where I was in Maine.  I realized that I'm eating the same on 20-25 miles days as I was on 15-18 mile days. And since I've been consistently doing 20-25 miles, it makes since I've lost weight.  So, I either need to eat more, or cut the miles back.  I think I'll try and cut the miles.  
I spent most of the day eating, relaxing, and taking care of myself.  I'll try and get another good nights sleep and get out on the trail around mid day.  It's not the most hiker friendly town but hope to be able to get a hitch back up to Newfound Gap. ","Gatlinburg, TN

Got up there and out on the trail by 9am.  Temps were in the mid to upper 40's most of the day with winds 20-30mph.  In and out of fog/clouds so all of that made for a pretty chilly day. 
Got some really nice views today, some of the best I've seen in the south.  My favorite was from Charlie's Bunion.  Nice rock outcrop with spectacular views down to the Tennessee foothills.  Sat there for about an half an hour and ate lunch.
Lots of downed trees on the trail made the hiking a bit slow going at times.  Only saw two other people all day and that was within the first hour or so.

3 other hikers ended up coming in late.  Was nice to have the company.  We chatted for a bit and I went o bed around 8:30.  Slept ok and got up around 6:30.  Was a cold, rainy, foggy morning.  Didn't feel like getting out there and hiking, but of course I did.  Was on the trail about 7:40.
Stayed in the fog a good part of the day and not much to see. Trail was really wet and feet ended up getting pretty soaked which wasn't fun.  Slipped on some wet rocks/leaves and landed on my right palm.  Dont think I broke anything but Ive got a pretty big bruise and its difficult to do some tasks with that hand. 
Today was my last day in the Smokies and was kinda glad to get out of there. Made it down to Davenport Gap and then crossed under I-40.  This was the same little section I had hiked when I was driving across country back in March.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Hiked up to Standing Bear Hostel and got a food drop I had sent.  I've got way too much food now since I was in Gatlinburg but probably won't have to resupply in Hot Springs.

Didn't sleep well at all last night. Was really warm and I heard some loud really strange noises that I hadn't heard before.  Like a mating call.  Wasn't a coyote, or bird or anything.  Maybe a cat of some sort? Anyway got up at 5:45 and was out on the trail by 6:25.
Made really good time and had some great views of the fog in the valley below again.  Hiked the 7 miles to Hot Springs and was there by 9.  Looked around Laughing Heart Hostel and couldn't find anyone there, and couldn't call anyone since I have ATT.  So walked into town to the Post Office.  Picked up the Solomons I had sent ahead (the ones I hiked NH and ME in) and sent the Nikes back home.  Went down the street and did laundry and then walked up the Elmers.  Couldn't figure out if they were full so walked back to Laughing Heart.  Decided just to pay for a shower and get back on the trail.
Stopped at the diner on the way out and had a good meal and picked up some extra snacks at the Dollar General.  Got back on the trail at 1. 
I soon realized I made the wrong decision with the shoes.  They had been really good but were just too worn out.  They have 400 miles on them and I thought they were ok. But I can feel every stick, rock, acorn poking through.  Really could use a rock plate in them.  After 11 miles in them my feet felt pretty beat up as were getting blisters on the side of my heels.

Had dozed off a bit around 4-5 and awoke to screams of ""help"" in the distance.  Took me a while to realize what was happening and me and couple other from the shelter headed up the trail to see what was going on.  About a tenth of a mile north we found a guy who had been tenting and evidently lost his way going to take a poop.   He followed our  voices back down and the ""crisis"" was averted.  He was a long way from his tent...not sure how he got there.
Had planned on doing 22 miles, but I was beat up, tired, and just worn out.  I haven't been enjoying my hike as much lately and it's been tough.  Been missing my friends, family, my girlfriend, music, lots of things.  I realized I had no idea really why I was forcing myself to do 20-25 miles a day.  I had plenty of time to finish, and I know I'll look back and wonder why I pushed so hard.  So after talking to my girlfriend a bit and getting some encouragement, I decided to knock back the miles and take my time and try and enjoy things more.  And that's what I did...and I had a wonderful day.  I hiked about 16 miles, took long breaks for lunch and some views and made it into camp by 3:30.  Set up my tent, took a little cat nap, then chatted with CooCoo for a bit when she got in.  Made a fire, which I haven't done since New York, and had a nice relaxing evening.

It was a beautiful morning, and just a beautiful warm early fall type day.  The hiking was fairly easy with only a couple steep bigger climbs later in the day.  The trail through the forest has been spectacular the last few days. The trees are starting to show more hints of color and it's as if autumn is playing out right before my eyes.  
Chatted with a few nice section and day hikers along the way and was nice to see some people out and about enjoying the trail and the weather.
Called Natures Inn Hostel and they were super nice on the phone.  Sarah, the owner, met us at the trailhead at 4pm and drove us the few miles down the road to the hostel.  I haven't stayed at hostel since I was in the North.  Most of the ones I've been by down here have been lacking.  No offense to any of them, but in comparison it's the truth.  So I had been a bit skeptical about staying here but all the reviews have been stellar and decided to give it a shot.  So glad I did...it is amazing.  Everything is brand new, and got a little cabin by a creek.  It's got two beds in it and a screened in porch with a hammock.  Ate some pizza and ice cream, and took a nice hot shower.

Made it into camp around 4:30 and there were 3 section hikers set up there already.  All nice people.  We chatted a bit and two of them went to Virginia Tech...where my dad went to school.  
Shortly thereafter Cuckoo strolled in and we all hung out and ate dinner and chatted by the fire.  Really nice way to end a good day.

Slept pretty well and got up around 6am.  Made breakfast and said goodbye to Cuckoo and headed up the trail around 7:15.
Another gorgeous morning and day with temps starting off around 60 and got up to 80.  The trail was fairly moderate again today with some ups and downs and one big climb up to Roan High Knob at 6200'.  Took my time and have really been enjoying just been out in the woods and in nature.  Really happy with my decision to slow down and take it all in. 17-18 miles I'm finding is about my perfect distance for a day.  I can take my time, make some miles, enjoy myself, and get into camp pretty early.
Today I ran into Dancing Bear on the trail. I had hiked with him and Young Giraffe for about a week in Maine and they summited Katahdin a day behind me.  He had resumed his flip flip hike in the Shenandoahs Aug 19 and looking for finish here in the next few weeks. It was so great seeing him, and running into a familiar face.  It's like we're family.  This trail has a way of doing that.
Stopped by the old Cloudland Resort site and walked around a bit.  They had real toilets and water and was nice to take a pit stop.  For those of you who don't know, the Shelters in this section for about 200 miles do not have privies.  So I've been digging lots of holes.  
Chatted with some tourists and day hikers at the site and they all were super curious about my hike and asked tons of questions. Was nice getting to talk with them a bit.
Made it up to Roan High Knob Shelter around 4pm.  It has the distinction of being the highest Shelter on the AT at just over 6200'.  Set up my tent and chatted with a couple of nice weekenders by a fire while I made dinner. Could hear the rumble of thunder in the distance, but knew it's wasn't going to hit us.  I've missed the sound of it, very majestic in a way.  Back in Oregon we don't get thunderstorms.

Didn't sleep hardly at all last night for some reason.  Went to bed fairly early around 7:45 or 8 and just kinda laid there for the longest time.  Was nice and cool out and I thought I'd sleep well. Maybe too much on my mind.
Got up around 6:30 and was out on the trail a little after 7.  Another gorgeous morning, clear and warm.  Had been really excited about going over the balds today.  But just wasn't feeling good the first couple miles of the day.  
I shook it off after I got to Carvers Gap and ended up having a wonderful day.  The Roan Highlands are absolutely spectacular.  So wide open and beautiful with views in every direction.  It reminded me a little of being above treeline in the Whites.  
Took a break at Little Hump Mountain and talked to some University of Florida students who were doing a weekend trip.  They asked all sorts of questions about my hike and my gear and was really nice chatting with them a bit.
On the way down to US19 I ran into Spider.  He is a flip flop thru Hiker I had hiked with some in NY.  I chatted with him a bit as well.  So neat running into people I know! 
Called and set up a ride at 3:30 with Doe River Hostel in Roan Mountain.  Got set up there and just relaxing a bit now.  Really like this place a lot!

The weather was warm and amazing, again.  Getting hard to believe my luck with the weather...been incredible for 2 weeks straight now. No rain is in the forecast and temps are supposed to cool slightly. Weather, and scenery like this is why I miss fall in Virginia so much.  Really glad I've slowed my pace a bit and soaking it all in. 
The trail was nice for the most part of the day.  Kinda opened up a bit in the morning and walked through some nice forest.  Went by Laurel Falls around midday and sat there for a bit.  One of the bigger waterfalls on the trail. 
Had one decent climb for the day at the end and made it over to Boots Off Hostel around 2pm.  My replacement air pad from Nemo was waiting for me as was some vitamins I had mailed ahead. Pretty nice and relaxing hostel and hoping to get a ride into town later to resupply.
Today I the 1900 mile mark for me on the Appalachian Trail.  Only 290 to go! And I realized that I've hiked 13 days in a row without taking a zero, which is my longest stretch.  I actually feel really good physically and I think cutting back my miles a little has helped so much.  Not only physically, but mentally as well.  I don't feel like I need to take a day off or anything, and I'm enjoying things more.","Moreland Gap Shelter

Didn't sleep well again last night at the hostel.  Was still up around 1am.  Not sure what it is, but it's definitely taking its toll on me.  Got up around 7, ate some breakfast and was on the trail by 8.
Thought it was going to be a fairly easy day, but it wasn't.  Lots of distractions, I rolled my ankle and face planted (I'm ok, really) lots of starts and stops, and just was frustrated.  And somehow most of the music on my iPhone got deleted.  Not sure how it happened (and no, it's not in the cloud).  It was kinda like loosing a friend.

Didn't sleep at all last night again. Was tossing and turning up until 3 or so.  Finally had enough and just decided to get up around 4 am.  Fixed some breakfast and was out on the trail a little before 5 am. Decided to hike the 26 miles into Damascus.  Something inside of me just wanted to get into Virginia. To just get home.
It was the first time I really had night hiked.  I was in the dark for about 2 hours and it was a little unnerving at first.  Hard to see the trail, different sounds, and just dark feeling.  After about a half an hour I got used to it and started to enjoy the calmness of it all.  
The sun started coming up right when I was passing over a cow pasture and it was just spectaculars. Got some great photos of first light with a few stars still visible.
I made good time most of the day, and made a couple little snack and water stops.  The trail was really nice, and open, and not many big climbs at all. And again, the weather was perfect, and no rain in the forecast at all.
I got to the VA state line around 1pm, about 23 miles into the day. As I approached I just broke down in tears. So many days wondering if I would ever make it this far and see that sign.  It was a lot more emotional than I imagined.  I started to remember all the things I been through, and done.  It's just amazing. And I'm so grateful.
Got into Damascus a little after 2...Did the 26 miles in a little over 9 hours.  Decided to stay at Woodchucks Hostel...great place! Got cleaned up, a resupply, and hope to get some rest and back out on the trail tomorrow.  Going back to taking my time tomorrow.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Slept very well at the hostel last night. Probably the best night's sleep in weeks.  Got up around 7, had a good breakfast at the hostel consisting of blueberry waffles, potatoes, hard boiled eggs, cereal with almond milk, and orange juice.  Took a shower and was out the door around 7:45.  
Walked through Damascus and it was a wonderful early fall morning in a small mountain town .  Cool and misty with the leaves crunchy under my feet as I walked down the sidewalk.  How I've missed fall in Virginia. 
Decided to stop at Mojo's coffee shop for a bit.  Really nice spot!  Got some decaf coffee and hung out a while.  Stopped by the outfitter next door and chatted a bit and got a new water filter.  Mine worked but was just getting worn out after about 1000 miles. 
Got back on the trail around 9:30 and took my time most of the day.  The trail followed the Virginia Creeper Trail for a little part of the day which was nice.  Mainly a bike trail, the Virginia Creeper is a33 mile trail that was converted from an old abandoned railway.  
The hiking was pretty easy for the most part with only a few moderate climbs.  Made it to the shelter around 4:30pm.  Only one other guy here for the evening, and he's a section hiker from GA.
I've mapped out a rough idea of how I want my remaining hike to go, with all the places I'll be staying. I'll average about 15 miles a day and try to finish my thru hike on Friday, October 13 at Rt 311 in Catawba, VA.  
Tomorrow I'm excited as I'll head into the Grayson Highlands and summit Mt Rogers It's on a half mile side trail with no views, but it's the tallest point in Virginia and supposedly the highest mountain east of the Mississippi you can't drive to the top of.  I hiked around there when I was younger but never went to the top, so excited to do that.  And really hoping to see some wild ponies!","Damascus, VA

I had planned a pretty easy day as I wanted to stay up near Mt Rogers at Thomas Knob Shelter.  Had a beautiful walk thru a cow pasture just after sunrise. And then a decent climb up to Buzzard Rock on Whitetop Mountain.  The view was spectacular and I just sat there for about 45 minutes taking in the Virginia countryside to the NW. 
After that I was in and out of meadows and forests and started seeing some fir trees which was great.  Got up to Thomas Knob Shelter and there were hordes of weekenders tenting around with their shiny new gear, camp chairs, and cocktails. 
Got some water and then found a nice spot to set up my tent.  After that I headed up to Mt Rogers, the tallest point in Virginia at 5729'. It's on a .5 mile side trail off the AT and a pretty easy climb up.  There are no views from the top, and that is why I bypassed it back when I was hiking around here all those years ago. But this time, I wanted to get to the highest point in my home state.  It was pretty uneventful, and basically just a rock in a grove of fir trees. But I'm glad I went up there.
Didn't see any ponies today...hopefully tomorrow.

Also saw lots of cows, some with big horns. A bit intimidating, and even though they seemed docile I kept my distance.
Most of the day was spectacular and really enjoyed hiking.  Cool, with a nice breeze and the leaves are taking on more vibrant colors. The trail itself was pleasant and easy with the exception of one rocky section coming out of the highlands.

Wasn't much else going on today.  Wanted to get to the Mt Rogers Visitors Center before they closed at 4.  So today was a bit of a blur.  The trail was pretty easy with some ups and downs and rocks. Made the 19 miles before 3.  It's interesting how my body just kicks into another gear when I want it to now.  Didn't used to be like that.  Today is 19 days hiking without a zero and I'm beginning to think my body just doesn't like the time off.

Some up and downs that weren't too bad, but the thing that stood out was that trail got really rocky.  Lots of small loose rocks and combine that with leaves and the hiking was tedious.  
Not too many sights to see today with only one little over look.  Walked by a settler museum that had an old house, barn, and root cellar.  Kinda reminded me of my childhood.

Ran into lots of SOBO's today, like 10-12.  Kinda crazy...a SOBO bubble.  There were a couple I had met in the north and we chatted a bit.  Always nice seeing familiar faces and swapping stories, even if just for a minute.  
The big thing on everyone's mind now is water. It is really scarce. I hiked almost 15 miles today and all the reliable sources were dry. The only thing that was running was a river through a cow pasture and that wasn't safe to drink.  I knew it was going to be bad but didn't think it'd be this bad.

The trail was really nice most of the day as it followed a ridgeline and the ups and downs were fairly gentle.  The fall colors are coming in nicely and it's making the hike even more enjoyable.

I got a shuttle from the hostel to the trailhead and was out hiking by 8:15am.  I had planned on doing about 15 miles today since it was a late start, but realized there was no water anywhere near the campsite I wanted to go to, and the shelter after that was closed due to gypsy moths killing the trees near there.  So my only real option was to do 21.7 to a place near a stream. 
Was really struggling cause it was hot and really humid, and still wasn't feeling well. Had to make a couple unplanned stops along the way, which wasn't fun.  Was also feeling a bit emotional about the hike coming to and end, and was also thinking about my dad a lot. His birthday coming up on Wednesday and he would have been 74 and really wish he could have seen me do this.  He struggled all his life with different types of pain.  He had debilitating rheumatoid arthritis from an early age, and had his first heart valve replacement when he was 37.  So, he was never able to hike or throw a football around or anything like that.  I know he'd be proud of me and is with me, and a part of me has pushed so hard at times during this hike for him just because I know he would have loved to have been able to do things like this if he could have.

Today was rough again.  Got up and out on the trail by 7:40. Trail was really rocky and slippery a good part of the day, reminded me of PA at times. And the weather has been pretty miserable for this time of year.  Temps in the mid 80's with really high humidity.  I haven't sweated this much at any other time on the trail.  The last time I think I sweated this much was back in high school during football practice.  Kinda crazy for the second week of October.
I tried to get through the day the best I could and stay positive. There were a couple of nice views today and a really nice mile section through a pasture.  I'm starting to cross roads that I travelled many times back in my youth.  It's interesting to see the familiar landscape from a different perspective. 
I have 2 days and 32.3 miles left.  Still so hard to believe that I'm almost done and it looks like I'm going to complete my thru hike. Throughout the last two days I've had so many thoughts and flashbacks about the trail, things that have happened, people I've met, magic I've experienced.  I could have never imagined in my wildest dreams everything that's happened.  Even though my body and mind are just worn out, I'm so grateful for the experience and constantly thinking of new possible adventures. 
But first, there is the matter of 32.3 miles.  ","Campsite near VA635

I didn't sleep hardly at all last night.  It started raining hard around 8pm and rained most of the night.  I stayed dry except for some condensation, but still not a great night.  And to add to it, the temperature when I woke up was in the low 70's.  The warmest night of my whole hike.  Just crazy. 
Got up around 6:30 and was out on the trail by 7:20.  Was really foggy to start the day and had a couple of decent climbs.  The fog started burning off around mid morning and things got hot again with temps in the mid 80's and high humidity.  I kinda figured my last few days were going to be trying somehow given how smooth things had been for weeks. 
Trail was really rocky for a while then got better as the day went on.  Had a couple of nice views and took my time soaking it all in.  Spent a lot of the day thinking about all I've experienced on my hike.  That combined with it being my dad's birthday made things a bit emotional.  I can't believe it'll be all over tomorrow.   Not sure how I feel.  Right now it hasn't hit me that I'm about to complete one of the hardest things I've ever done.  And that I pushed through all that pain, and all the injuries. It just feels like another night on the trail. I know tomorrow will be different.  It will hit me, and I know I'll have tears in my eyes when I get to VA311.  
Right now, I'm grateful. So grateful for this journey. And grateful for one last night on the AT.","Campsite near VA42

The last day.  Hard to believe it's here. Didn't sleep at all last night.  Too excited and anxious. Got up around 6:45 and was on the trail by 8am. 
So many things went through my mind during the last day. All the miles, mountains, and people kept flashing threw my eyes.  The climbs, the smiles, the pain.  The literal blood, sweat, and tears. The day was emotional, even more so than imagined.  I broke down in tears quite a few times along the way in random spots.  The trail had broken me in a way, but I was still there, walking, coming up on the finish line.  It was beautiful, and exciting, and sad.  So difficult to describe all that I felt, and I only think another thru Hiker could understand.
The hiking was pretty good for the most part.  Made it up to Dragon's Tooth around 11 and climbed up to the top and just sat there for an hour.  Marveling at how far I'd come, and all the fears I'd conquered along the way.  The hike down from there was pretty rocky and tricky.  Reminded me of some the descents in some of the Whites. 
Took my time the rest of the day, and soaked it all in the best I could.  Took one last break at some cliffs about a mile from VA311.  Sat there and looked over northern Roanoke County, the place where I'd called home for so many years.  Tears rolled down my face again.  I was actually finishing this.  
Made it down to the parking lot and two of my best friends were there for me with hugs and balloons.  We took some pictures and then headed a mile down the road to eat ate the Homeplace Restaurant.  I hadn't been there in 20 years and was still as I remembered.  Amazing, and a perfect way to end my journey.
So grateful. So very grateful.","Campsite near Trout Creek
