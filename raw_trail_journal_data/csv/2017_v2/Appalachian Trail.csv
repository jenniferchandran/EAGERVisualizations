Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566091,"Today's task was to round up what I'm taking with me. I've got the water filter, so hopefully Bob's bringing his stove. Going light as usual and hoping I don't freeze. Made it to 50 still alive, so should be ok.Old favourites: Ultralight bivy with RAB down top bag inside a US military light bag (should be light but warm enough, fingers crossed), Thermarest Neo Air sleeping pad, SealSkinz socks (for all the wet trails and water), Montane ultralight rain parka, down jacket, Petzl XPO head lamp, Salomon XA Pro 3D GTX trail running shoes (about due for a new pair though since I wear these every single day), Sawyer water filter. I'm taking the 30L OMM bag. Sad to leave the 25L OMM classic home, but need a bit more space due to the weather. New additions this year: Jetboil stove made by my son with the Boy Scouts at the JetBoil factory on a tour (sweet deal), 3X3 DD tarp tent that has shaved off some weight from the tent (having so much fun playing with this, it's like doing origami with endless possibilities).",,View Entry,"May 25, Thu",0
Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566828,"Weather: cool, but the rain from the previous day ended and the sun came out. No bugs and the temperature was in the 50s and perfect.Trail conditions: Still wet, but not bad, with some snow still on the trail above about 3,000 feet. There was actually more snow and water on the other side of South Crocker Mountain. A few large trees have fallen across the trail, but only one was a major problem. We started at 9:30am from the parking lot on Highway 27. Slow steady uphill hike. Met two trail runners at the parking lot and then as they were coming back down. They were from Texas and only had a couple of hours to run. We didn't meet any other hikers until the summit of North Crocker. Nice bunch of guys. Then we met a bunch of people coming up from the road via South Crocker. Conditions couldn't have been much better, except for the snow and water on that south side. Views of the Bigelows and Sugarloaf from South Crocker were excellent. The descent off of South Crocker was wet and then rocky and steep. Worried a lot about Bob slipping and falling, but he managed well. Arrived at the camp site at around 6pm, so about 9 hours to do just over 7 miles. Slow going, with an average speed of less than 1mph. That includes some stops at the summits though.Beautiful night with no bugs at all and no rain. Slept under the stars on the tent platform. Bob was drugged and asleep at 7pm. I sat twiddling my thumbs and fell asleep later. Slept warm, with the night time temperature around 40F.Down top bag inside the green military external bag was perfect for the conditions. Fortunately didn't need the tarp or a bug net.Food and water were perfect. Still carrying a bit more weight than I'd like, but trimming down from 18 pounds is going to take some work. I'd use the OMM 30L bag if I ever thru hiked. It's just the right size for me to carry everything I need and nothing excessive.Great night's sleep, at least until my pee break at 4am.","Highway 27 AT parking lot

Appalachian Trail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566832,"I got up for my morning pee at 4am. After his 9 hours of sleep, Bob says 'Are you awake?' Bad question, because now you woke me up from dreamy pee land. I figured rather than fighting to go back to sleep to just get up. So we set off at 5am. He went ahead while I did my privy business. Heard some rustling ahead on the trail when I set off. Thought it was Bob, but then realized it was a moose coming out of the trees. He turned right toward me on the trail, then realized I was standing there. His double-take and then about-face to flee was hilarious. What a dopey animal. Only 1 mile down to the road, but wet and gnarly trail with lots of water and rocks. Just more of that very rough south side of those mountains. We covered it fast. Went and had a look at the river crossing as the AT continues on the other side of that road. Lots of very swift water. Glad I wasn't attempting that. I'd have to plan and give that crossing some very serious thought before I actually did it. Could be extremely dangerous at this time of year. Lots of water coming down off those mountains this year.We walked very fast back to the parking lot. We covered 7.53 miles in just 2 hours and 48 minutes. Compare that to the previous day's 9 hours for less distance. Bob even broke into a trot at one point. We had a good chat and wonderful time. Back to the car by 8am. Now what do we do? We drove into Farmington, got some breakfast, and then drove over to NH to take a look at the new place in Eaton. Then back home and we arrived at around 3:30pm. Great weekend hiking. Now I'm just missing that middle section between Saddleback and the Crockers. How not convenient. But conditions seem to be much better when we go together and not alone.","Crocker Cirque camp site
