Crazy legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579351,"First day back on trail after a looong break.  Feels great. Hiking with Turtle Stone (Jenny Kelley). Started with this 9 mile slack pack, but I'm not counting this since I already did this section. Today was for Jenny, tomorrow I start where I had left off previously.","Bearfence Mountain Hut

Had a great day even though we hiked entirely in clouds, fog, and/or rain. We were soggy by the end of our trek. FUN!","Jeremy's Run Overlook

Started out again in clouds, fog, and rain. AND....it rained all day. We resupplied with our 2 sherpas, Pete and Tim, at Compton Gap then continued up and down on rocky trails to Tom Floyd Shelter. The wet rocks and fallen leaves made for some slippery slopes. I was especially careful since I don't bounce off the ground like I used to. Jenny spotted a small black bear and we also saw a young buck rubbing his antlers on a tree. Treated with numerous apple trees and their bounty.  Glad to be dry in the shelter, temps dropping through the low 60's, windy, and rain sounding off on the metal roof.  Enjoyed sharing the shelter with Sturgeon and Sequoia, 2 through hikers.","Gravel Springs Gap

Rough night of sleep due to rain pounding the roof, but still felt good in the morning. Hiked 3 miles to Rt. 522 to meet up with our sherpas. They surprised us with warm blueberry muffins and hot chocolate.  Sweeeeet!  After a nice break we pressed on through some rocky trails and of course uphill. Met several southbound hikers including a couple from Germany, 2 sisters from Germany, 10 high schoolers on a weekend field trip, Wolfie, Shiker Quaker and his Parasite friend, and Shep with his dog Ollie. Stopped at another very nice shelter with a deck, picnic shelter with a fire pit, privy, and a solar shower. After my ""chilly"" shower (no sun to heat the water) I joined Melissa, Jenny, Jack Flash(the fire builder tonight), and 3 ladies tenting nearby for dinner by the fire.  No rain, yeah!!!","Tom Floyd Shelter

Slept GREAT last night. Met our sherpas, Pete and Tim, at a road crossing 3 miles into our day.  Resupplied, chowed down, and even washed up a bit in the RV. Heaven!  Mary, from last night's shelter, hiked with us those first miles. After 7 miles of mostly rocky trail we arrived at our next shelter.  Just beyond Dick's Dome shelter is a newer/nicer one called Whiskey Hollow Shelter.  Good stream by both.  Glad to finally have some sun today to help dry our gear. Now if we could just fix the humidity!  Ended our day with a campfire with 3 ""interesting characters"".  Let's just call them One Eyed Rickie, Clomp Foot, and Batman, who looked remarkably like Michael Keaton.","Jim and Molly Denton Shelter

Rained last night and I was awake for most if it.  Luckily it stopped by morning. Tim met us 5 miles in at the Rt 50 crossing with treats.  We are SPOILED.  Pleasant day including just the right amount of challenge and a path through meadows in Sky Meadows State Park. Turned sunny and windy when we arrived at the shelter, so could finally really dry our gear.  Nice piped spring to filter water and wash up a bit. Older shelter with a picnic pavilion and 2 rock fire fire pits.  If you stop here in the Fall watch out for giant walnuts falling from the trees.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Interesting night. Started raining hard at midnight, so I had to get up and put my rain cover on my pack that was hanging near the roof overhang. Later Jenny woke up and moved due to a leek over her sleeping spot. Shortly after that Melissa felt a leak and moved. Luckily we were the only 3 in the shelter so could move around all night!  Four tenths of a mile into our morning trek we started into the ""ROLLER COASTER"", a series of steep ups and downs for over 13 miles. Today we did 8 peaks in 10 miles. We saw a few nice streams, stopping at one extra nice one for a break. The steepness and the rocks almost did me in, BUT NOT QUITE, cuz I made it to Bears Den Hostel. Tim and Pete met us there for a resupply, brought pizza and salad, and picked up Melissa. She flies back to Colorado tomorrow. It was great having her with us for those days. Gonna miss her company.","Rod Hollow Shelter

We had the hostel all to ourselves last night....like having a private room. Made pancakes and tea for breakfast, supplied by the hostel.  Mark Cusic shuttled our packs to the Blackburn AT Center so we could slack pack 8 miles. Had some great views on this coolish day at Bears Den Rocks and Raven Rocks.  Crossed out of Virginia into West Virginia and finished out the roller coaster. Thank you Lord....I made it. Slow but sure! Took my pic by Wilson Gap.  My maiden name was Wilson and my father was born in West Virginia. Enjoyed a stop at the Blackburn Center, where Cheryl ""Nike"", the caretaker treated us to homemade pumpkin cake and hot cider. Picked up our shuttled packs and climbed the steep path back to the AT.  I loved that place....better than Bears Den. Saw 1 buzzard at Buzzard Rocks and another deer (have seen several now). Made it to David Lesser Shelter where we had the whole really nice facility to ourselves.  That was surprising since we had once again seen several SOBO's on the AT, including Aristocat, a very nice young man from Oklahoma. There was a porch swing in the picnic pavilion and plenty of seating on the shelter deck.  Even though it will be close to freezing tonight we are cherishing this last night on the trail.","Bears Den Hostel

Lovely last night on the trail for this section. David Lesser was one of my favorite shelters so far.  Woke twice last night to distant coyotes howling. Enjoyed the view from my bag looking at the silhouetted trees. It only dipped to the low 40's and was quite comfy in my down sleeping bag. Had a great view of the sunrise from both the privy and the shelter. We had a fairly easy hiking day since we dropped our packs with the guys at Keys Gap just 3 miles in. Had super views from the power lines atop one of the mountains. Met several hikers including Oakie who was excited to share he only had 200 miles left to complete the AT.  The weather was perfect, around 70 and sunny, when we reached the Potomac River, the border between West Virginia and Maryland. Yeah! Another state down.  After I go back and pick up a 150 mile section I missed down south by I40 I'll have everything from Springer Mt to Maryland. We hiked through Harpers Ferry to the AT Conservancy where our pictures and info were added to the section hikers log book.  Thank you Jenny ""Turtlestone"" for being a great hiking partner.  You are AWESOMER!!!     PS I really did see a Pink Billed Awesomer on the trail today.     I now have a total of 873.4 miles on the AT!","David Lesser Shelter
