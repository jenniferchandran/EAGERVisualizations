Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555926,"We are impatiently waiting to begin our Thru Hike!We received our clothing last week and have been making sizing swaps as needed. We will receive the remainder of our gear on 15 March once we meet the rest of the team. Additionally, I have a case of Achilles tendonitis I have been fighting. Things were going well until yesterday when it flared up again. To further combat it, I have been doing additional stretching and taking anti inflammatory medication. We also have a brace on the way (Amazon screwed the shipping up, so it's probably at our neighbors house) that we were advised to get. Hoping it works - Either way, I will be starting the trail. Though we are excited to leave, we are doing our best to treasure the time we do have left. I don't know when the next opportunity will be to have this much time with our family. Anyways, we are stoked to get going. We are running the gambit of emotions and the butterflies are there. I don't think I will believe I am actually thru hiking until after the first week. Will post tomorrow - Apparently we need three minimum posts before Trail journals will link the account. Talk to you later!",,Home,"Mar 08, Wed",0
Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556008,"Tonight is an exciting night because it is the eve of us being 7 days from the start of our Thru hike! I know that sounds ridiculous, but we are extremely excited to begin.
We are finalizing the technological side of our Thru by getting apps taken care of and making sure everything is honed in. 
I am split between doing the VLOG or not, because it seems like it may be too much work for something that is supposed to be relaxing. We will see though, because I do feel like we would appreciate having the video down the road. 
I know I said it yesterday, but I still cannot believe we are within a week of thru hiking. We are super stoked for this to finally happen.
Well, until next time all!","Home

Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556300,"Hello all!We have reached the last day at home and will be departing for North Georgia tomorrow. Last night my mind was racing and I didn't get to sleep until much later because of the cascade of emotions I'm feeling right now. My biggest concern is injury, as I am still recovering from the achilles issue I suffered on the Foothills Trail. As stated earlier though, I will be going for it. There are hikers that have dealt with significantly worse that have made it. We'll be going for very low mileage (8-10) for the first month anyways. We are excited to meet the rest of our team. There is one that is an ultramarathon runner that we expect to say farewell too once our little group breaks apart on the 5th day. I'm sure he'll be to Katahdin by late July. The others though we have no idea on. It'll be interesting to see how our paces develop as we move on. Well, we will be waking up early tomorrow morning to say farewell to the family. It's bittersweet leaving them. We are very ready to begin but have enjoyed our stay here. I'll try to update tomorrow depending on signal - See ya!","Home

Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556544,"Hello!We woke up around 5AM today so that we could get a jump on last minute tasks and say goodbye to our family. Fortunately we were able to see everyone before work and school. We cleaned up my sister's room that we had been occupying for the last month, and finished packing. Around 10 we picked up our rental (Got a Dodge ram 1500 free upgrade, thanks again Glenn!) and took it back home. Shortly afterwards, we tossed our equipment in the truck and headed to the post office to send off our mail drop! After that was done, we were finally on our way to Blairsville. We used the Waze application, while supposedly re routes you based on hazards and traffic. I guess it did a good job because we never hit any, but it doesn't offer voiced directions so we had to make a couple U turns when we missed a turn.As we got closer to Blairsville, the snow began to move in. We had a few stray flakes on the flatlands that became a nice coating once we reached elevation. It wasn't until we passed Blood Mountain cabins that I realized we would be passing Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap. I was super excited to be able to show Wella the outfitter. It was like a dream come to life, because you hear so much about it by reading blogs and then you are physically there. Really cool!After checking out the store, we made it to Blairsville and returned our rental where we met Sam (Fellow warrior expeditions member). Sam was kind enough to host us in Blairsville since we were unable to get a ride on a Wednesday when everyone else was heading to Dahlonega. His house was perched way up on a mountain and was stunning. Wella and I want one like his in Alaska. We went for Mexican food around 7PM, and after a great meal returned to his house where we promptly fell asleep. The overnight low was in the teens and the wind was howling, so we were very happy to be indoors.","Home

Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556552,"Hello all!We woke up around 7AM (The snooze button was pressed a few times) and made our preparations to leave Sam's house. Around 8ish, we piled into his truck and travelled into Blairsville. Sam sent off a package from the post office, and afterwards we went to a breakfast place called Hole in the Wall which was fantastic. After eating, we departed for Dahlonega so that we could check out our accommodations for the next few days. We arrived around 11AM, which was far too early to check in, so we went into Dahlonega to check out the town. We browsed the outfitter and a few other shops, before settling down and having cake and coffee at a small cafe. The cake was fantastic, but very filling.Once we finished eating, we travelled back to the Forrest Hills resort where we met with Mr. Gobin and three other warrior hikers. As others trickled in, we got to know each other's backgrounds a little more until it was time for dinner. Dinner was buffet style and tasty. I didn't eat much, as my appetite isn't in high gear from the nerves of the impending hike. I imagine I'll be destroying food in no time, but it isn't there yet. After dinner we got a fire going in our common room and talked more. Everyone in the group has been very approachable. There is a nervous excitement in the air as we are all ready to start. It is definitely very surreal. I feel like I will wake up at some point and it will be a dream. Tomorrow we receive the details regarding our resupply opportunities and get the rest of our gear, so we are stoked. It will be a short day so we get an opportunity to pack everything up. It's looking like we will start Friday between 10-11. We are so excited!!!!!","Blairsville, GA

Squatting Bare,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556677,"Good evening!Today we had our briefings for town support, hiking techniques, and best of all received our gear!!! We broke everything down and re packed it to include all the junk we brought from home. My best guestimate for our pack weight is around 35LBs. We will see was the truth teller (pack scale) says at Amicalola Falls State Park tomorrow!We are super excited to begin our adventure, and I doubt I will get any sleep tonight. It has been such a blessing being able to experience this through Warrior Expeditions. Our fellow veterans are incredible people with awesome backgrounds. It will be a huge advantage already having a trail family right out the gate, but we are excited to meet the other hikers. If I had to describe the feeling of the day before starting a thru hike, I would liken it to being a child on Christmas Eve. I know I have said it before but we are so excited. Not only are we excited, but our friends and family are excited for us, which is amazing. We are extremely spoiled by all of the support we have received and it will certainly drive us through difficult times. Speaking of difficult times, it's looking like we will have quite a bit of rain ahead of us. That will make things very interesting. I can handle cold, but being cold and wet is no fun. Either way, it'll only make us appreciate the sunny days that much more. Tomorrow is looking to be overcast, which will be great as it'll keep the sun off us. We have a lot of climbing to do from the state park before we reach Springer Mountain. I have hiked that particular section twice before, but I know it will be completely different this time. I do plan on taking my sweet time, as I am terrified that my Achilles injury will flare up. I'll be doubling down on Ibuprofen and using my brace to keep it manageable. That and tons of stretching and breaks. Man. I wish I knew what else to say. This is incredible. It's every emotion at once. All I do know is I am so thankful for what I have. A wonderful partner, supporting friends and family, getting to do this through Warrior Expeditions.. it is amazing. Well, it's time to get some sleep before the big day. Talk to you soon!","Forrest Hills Mountain Resort, Dahlonega
