Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563627,"Just over a month out from my start date. Sitting up late on a Sunday night scrolling through social media and seeing a constant stream of posts begging for attention - desperate for any sort of affirmation that people mean something to other people. I have been no different. Most of my life has been consumed by this need to impress. Unresolved childhood shame has instilled this mindset where me within myself = inadequate. So, I do *extreme* things with the hope that maybe accomplishing them will validate my existence to others and also to myself. Rockstar copycat hair colors, bright skinny jeans, wild eye makeup, running marathons, competing with CrossFit, jumping out of airplanes, traveling abroad... thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail... The past few years have altered my head and my heart very much. I'm not sure if my mind is still in that same space as before. At this point, I'd like to believe I simply ache for adventure and light and energy in this quiet life. Then again, maybe one doesn't have to walk 2,200 miles to embrace those exact things right here and now... I look forward to spending time with myself - having nothing but time to acknowledge and sit with both the ugliness and the goodness of me. My thoughts, my demons... the society-based ""significant"" things becoming less, and the understated miracles of nature becoming more / blowing me the f*ck away.  Maybe I'll have some revelations. Or maybe I'll just be grateful to get through each day without falling victim to swarms of insects. :)",,View Entry,"May 08, Mon",0
Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568860,"Day 1 and I've already experienced what it means to plan on not sticking with the plan.... Originally, I had my heart set on summiting the famous beast Mt. Katahdin today. However, due to monsoon-like weather predictions, my dad and I were persuaded to knock out a less ball-busting part of the trail instead, saving Katahdin for tomorrow. Hopefully. With a 5,000+ ft elevation gain, the 10.4 mile Katahdin hike is no joke and is apparently pretty miserable when the weather isn't ideal. So. Here's to hoping for a little sun tomorrow. The rain came down heavy for the last 5 miles of the trail today. It took everything in me to refrain from attempting to run over wet rocks and tree roots while hauling a 30lb pack. Just wanted to get the hell out of there after awhile. My shriveled raisin hands were slipping on my trekking poles and snot was sprinting down my nose and mosquitos were swarming and my clothes were soaked through and I had to pee like a mofo. BUT. The first 5 miles were lovely (see photos!). Despite the cold and despite the downpour, the 10 miler today was ultimately really beautiful. Flat-ish and deep green and alive. My heart raced when I saw the first white blaze trail marker in REAL LIFE. Plus, I learned that my packing skills are supreme because even though every god forsaken inch of me was drenched, NONE of the gear inside my pack got wet. (S/O to Osprey for making a bomb rain cover). Not every day will be a rainstorm. Fingers crossed, anyways. ""You've just got to take it day by day.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569051,"Ben Howard wrote a song called Conrad. In this song he placed these lyrics: ""Climb out, out to where you see, the curl of the world"". I thought of those words - I felt them throughout our 10 hour hike today. 10 hours to climb 5,000ft in 5.5 miles and then go down just the same. Baxter Peak on Mt. Katahdin. One of the hardest treks on the AT - done. We crawled above the clouds and my eyes misted over like the world now below us. Peaks and valleys and every shade of green. My photo with the Katahdin sign is a tribute to my crossfit journey. 3 years of squats and deadlifts and pull-ups and box step-ups (and a million other movements) prepared me VERY well for the steep incline of boulders that is this particular hike. Rarely felt out of breath - legs and back felt invincibly strong - self talk and mental game on point. Fist bumps from Maine, CF 405 fam. <3 The mosquitos here are damn wild. I have bites in the double digits and two of those find themselves on my FOREHEAD. Why tho. Other than those and the intense sunburn on my hands, I feel pretty fearless about taking off into the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow AM. Thank you for the birthday wishes today. All the love.

A fellow hiker named Bill helped me hang my food bag for the first time. He said he might have to quit the AT due to knee pain. I met another older dude named ""Stepping Wolf"". He's hiking with his dog Magnolia who very much appreciated the fact that I'd packed a tennis ball. Hope it doesn't storm tonight. I'd have no idea what to do.

It was a full house, I was lucky to get a spot - 7 of us in there total I think. In hindsight, I would have much rather slept in my tent. Didn't get a WINK of sleep in the lean-to because several were snoring at decibles I didn't even know were possible to unconsciously escape the lungs of humans. Also someone had a night terror and let out a shrill and abrupt ""OH MY GOD"" in the dead of night.

Enduring pain can cause much long-term harm. I embraced it for 50 miles and now I write from a bunk bed with an ice pack and a big plate of fresh fruit by my side. 0 regrets. What happened is I got a euphoric confidence boost after summiting the highest peak in Maine with relative ease. Amidst that euphoria, however, I failed to account for my 30-35lb pack since I didn't take it on the Katahdin climb.

Fell victim to 2-3 ""banana flips"" today, aka falls in which your feet fly forward and up as you land on your back. All except the last two miles of this stretch were doused in deep mud and mounds of wet slate. I haven't yet fallen face first into anything outside of low hanging tree branches, so that rules. Got pretty close when I slipped off a mossy log bridge and ended up on all fours, elbow-deep in stagnant, murky pond water this afternoon. It's hard to not be entirely overtaken by rage in those moments. Multiple times have I angrily launched my trekking poles across the trail & watched them clamor to the ground, knowing damn well I'd be full of regret if they broke. IDK y'all.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570567,"It occurred to me how I don't have a consistent answer when questioned about why I aim to hike 2,200 miles. Solo. With no backpacking experience. 
My answer normally starts off by asking them, ""Well, have you seen or read 'Into the Wild'?"" For those familiar with Alex Supertramp, I don't need to say any more. For those who haven't (aka the majority), I have further explaining to do. And it's always messy. So, here is the list:
Because everything. 
Because there is so much pain and I can't help but to feel it. Because it's a glorified concept to discredit Self and consequently to stay trapped in what you're misinformed is the way of things. Because one too many people have shrugged and told me ""that's just how it is"".
Because Christian companies fuck over their employees & customers & countries outside the US and front like they're something good and holy. 
Because if you must leave, leave as though fire burns under your feet. 
Because I feel sick when I sit in traffic. Because I can't see the stars that well back home. Because lovers cheat. Because sports games take priority over broken hearts. 
Because when I was in Chile, a wise stranger told me that there are so many things wrong in the world, but I need only go after one of them & that will help the Whole Thing. 
Because I've been worrying that we all live our lives in the confines of fear.  
Because I used to track every last calorie I consumed. 
I'm out here because the mind is very powerful. 
I'm here to have the feeling today or any day I am sufficient as I am. To be lost if it must be so! To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fullness and freedom. 
Because I listen to songs like ""Dream In Blue"" by the Stray Birds, ""Minority"" by Green Day, ""The Fear"" by Ben Howard, and ""The Only Thing"" by Sufjan Stevens, and a lot of Lord Huron. 
Because the Dead Poet's Society and because Shawshank Redemption.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571628,"The trail provides! 
So, something interesting about thru hiking is how you can randomly run into hikers you haven't seen for weeks (mostly due to pace changes or extra zero days, etc). My unplanned visit to Stratton ended up in me reconnecting with Fox, a girl I met upon my arrival to Maine almost a month ago. We both stayed at the AT Lodge in Millinocket, but she briskly started on the trail a couple days before me and I assumed I'd never see her again. 170 miles later here we both are at the Stratton Motel and, like me, she's struggling with mileage and head games and wondering how the fuck she's about to be able to complete the upcoming mountain range 1.) in any sort of reasonable time frame and 2.) in a way that actually feels fun instead of miserable. We are free, dammit! This shouldn't be so miserable. 
Enter: slack-packing. 
""For those that aren't familiar with the term, a slack-pack is a hiker expression that means you hand off either all or most of your pack to another person. You are then able to hike without the burden of your full weight, meaning that you have the potential to hike more miles at a faster rate.""
I'd heard about slack-packing through the hiker grapevine, but never really looked into it because it seemed complicated and also like ""cheating"". After hearing of my recent struggles, Fox approached me about going in on it with her and explained the process and I became convinced and.. dude.. game changer. We hiked 8.3 miles carrying only lunch and snacks for the day, water, and rain jackets. Total miracle. I haven't ever smiled this much during a hike. I ENJOYED the inclines and climbing over boulders and frogger-ing it across streams and mud pits. So much bliss without the burden of carrying unnecessary weight. All we had to do was pay the rad folks at the Stratton Motel to hold our packs and shuttle us to and from the trail. The price depends on how many people participate. The more people to split the cost, the cheaper it becomes. Sometimes as low as $3-$8 for a day.
Thinking we're going to do this through the rest of Maine and the Whites in New Hampshire.

Warm, sunny skies all day, good music, fun and mostly dry terrain (not so fun for those w/o slack packs tho). One of those days where I cannot help but to be entirely infatuated by Nature and introspection and song lyrics. When my thoughts get deeper than ""I hope they have a good bar in the next town.."". :-) ""Rushing around seems to be what's wrong with the world. Don't lose the dreams inside your head."" 2 mile incline, trekking poles leading the way, quads burning and sweat dripping from my brow and chin and Dave Matthews (DMB rules, shut up) humming through my headphones... I started thinking about a conversation Fox & I had earlier about the question ""who am I?"". We joked about it because everyone seems to be *looking for themselves* in one way or another out here. And maybe it's cliché to desire enlightenment, but also maybe it's an extremely productive mindset to have on the trail and, hell, even off the trail. Mindfulness. Intentionality. Consciousness. How do I want to be in this life? What do I want my interactions with others to look like? Am I contributing healing or harm to the collective energy of us all? 3 things came to me during this particular thoughtful trek: Kind without being insincere.
Funny without being mean. 
Honest, out of love. 
I think maybe it's hard to decide who you want to be when you've already been so many things, and when it'd be really easy to swing back & forth according to the situation. Or even when you've already habitually labeled yourself this way or that way for so many years. It's never too late to alter your self talk. 
And perhaps I'll never have an exact definition for my constantly-evolving self, but I want these to be the base of me, my interactions, the way I carry myself & the way I care for the Whole Thing.

• Had convo with an old dude who claimed anyone that slack-packs doesn't qualify as a backpacker, but as one who is simply walking the trail... I call bullshit because, ""hike your own hike"", right? Also, there's no ""simply walking the trail"" involved with rocky Maine/NH. Anyone care to share thoughts on this?

Fox and I are at the point where we have to ration our food until we get into town. Hers was a dinner of summer sausage & a crumbled pop tart. My breakfast in the morning will be leftover instant hummus. Such deprivation. :) Even though our mileage has been low for the past few days, it was ROUGH, quality-wise. 10+ hour days of up & downs, dripping sweat, re-filling water stores as much as possible. Luckily, the weather has been super ideal for us - I cannot imagine doing the past section in rain, especially the Mahoosuc Arm & Notch. Forget about it. Hell no. I slipped and ate it enough during sunny, dry weather (see photos) - bouldering among water soaked rocks would be a complete nightmare. And extremely dangerous, honestly. Just last a week, a kid from one of the many boys groups out here fell down some rocks and had to be rescued due to a broken leg. Yikes. 
Definitely excited to get down to ""easier"" terrain which, I've been told, begins in Vermont-ish. According to the descriptions I've heard per NOBOs regarding the Whites, I feel like Maine trains the SOBOs well for said towering mountains of NH. My legs shock me every day at how they find it in them to continuously hoist up waist-high boulders for hours and hours with 35 additional pounds weighing on them. The way my feet have gained confidence in knowing where/how to scurry down granite slabs with some sort of finesse. I've also learned to use the weight of my pack to my advantage, directing the way it tosses me & clearing gaps and mud puddles with relative ease. Totally different story from my days in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. Feet still ache every evening, but my trail legs have indisputably come in & they're ready for everything. My mind, too; it's falling apart less and less. 
Looking forward to getting to the town of Gorham, NH tomorrow. They have a Walmart! Current cravings: Peanut Butter Oreos, carrots, cashew ice cream, bananas, romaine lettuce, and chocolate cake icing.PS: this campsite is 0.2 mi off trail and was completely vacant (always highly likely because thru hikers don't prefer to blue blaze very far to camp).

We foraged those perfect little blues for a solid hour & gazed with longing eyes at the town from an exposed mountainside. So close, yet still several miles to trek. It ended up being soft pine needle ground, but my legs and feet were DONE & begging for a rest day. Pretty sure I heard my swollen quads audibly yell ""NO"" on one of the very last inclines. Such a relief to make it into town and get a beer (I somehow enjoy beer now?), pizza, and some indulgent groceries at Walmart. And, of course, the godly experience that is showering + putting on clean clothes. It was weird to see fast food places like Burger King & Subway for the first time in over a month. Walmart was a weird experience, too. Though clean, i still felt like a cave woman pushing a cart around with weary eyes and dirt stained toe nails and overwhelmed by the shock of society. All the fluorescent lights and sounds and unnaturally colored food products and regular humans dressed in regular human clothes with regular human schedules. I felt like Howie from The Benchwarmers. Luckily no panic attacks, but it sure soothed my chest to get out of there.

The only other time my feet have taken me close to this distance in one go was when I ran a full marathon in Nashville 4ish years back. My current hostel offers free slack packing for this specific section, so, obviously I hopped on that. 
And therefore Wildcat, the Carter domes, and Mt Moriah have officially been hiked by Rainbow. 
So far, New Hampshire isn't crazy different from Maine. Same ol' same ol' with the straight up/straight down rock scrambles. Less bogs and less mosquitos - praise. The White Mountain National Forest has a lot of trails in addition to the AT itself, so I have to spend a few more seconds staring at signage when it comes up. Stealth camping is generally not allowed and I think the fine for it is $150 (jeeeez). Other than those bits, I see no real difference. 
Every brief now and then, the trail offers a miracle by having long stretches of flat and smooth. I was able to run the last 3 miles today alongside Rattle River and mid key felt like Pocahontas. The stretch slopes downhill a couple times and made me feel like flying - everything blurred and all I could do was trust my feet and open up my arms and release laughter knowing this is my actual reality right now instead of anything else. One of those moments which brings me back to remembering why I wanted this. 
Had a solid Spotify playlist going on, too. Summer throwbacks: Black Eyed Peas, Avril Lavigne, Fall Out Boy, Bruno Mars, JB, James Bay, Cody Simpson, etc. Mainstream mood boosters. :) 
There wasn't one drop of rain today. Chilly & cloudy morning had me worried, but it cleared up and the sun warmed my bones and white puffy clouds hung like garland in that ocean sky.

First day back on the trail after about a billion rest days in Gorham. The whole town basically knew us by name. I'm not even sure how it happened, but I don't plan on taking more than two zeros in a row anymore... the feet were excessively unimpressed with how I blind sighted them. 
Summited Mt Madison & Mt Washington all in the same day and yes, it wrecked me, especially Madison - STEEEEEEP - but I was in a moderately stellar mood the whole time. Music, man. I really loved the trek itself despite it being extremely (and i do mean extremely) strenuous. 12 of the miles were completely exposed above the tree line. My favorite. Temperature in the high 70s / low 80s, but I was still glad to have on long sleeves, pants, and a hat. The sun would have otherwise annihilated my angel baby skin. It is a path of 100% rock though, so rain would absolutely make it a slip n slide nightmare - I highly recommend waiting for clear weather.

Carried full pack - Key music choices P!ATD and Paramore kept the positivity alive - ran out of water - 1/4th bag of skittles got me through the last mile up Washington - cheated a little by walking on the cog railroad - magical weather - sunset on my last 1.5 miles to Lakes of the Clouds, all full at the hut so they let me pay $5 to sleep on the floor - why are there so many little kids here? - vegan pumpkin bisque soup - consumed last two ibuprofen - neck aching something fierce

The only issue being that it will only get you space on the dining room floor to sleep... and during the night, it is constant foot traffic to/from the bathrooms as well as continuous snoring from all corners of the room. Unbelievable. It is a helpless feeling to be so exhausted and yet unable to sleep - I'm thinking I got about 3 spells of 30 minute snooze sessions throughout the whole night. How is it possible to walk so damn noisily? Y'all about to audition for STOMP or some shit? Seriously. 
Rant over. For now. 
Lack of sleep had my mental game on the low from the very beginning today. After the first 2 miles of rocks and an accidental blue blaze ascension over Mt Eisenhower, I was over it. Done. My feet and knees took much beating yesterday and I foolishly assumed today would magically be smoother. I couldn't even tell you how many times my head flew back & I ended up on my ass like a damn cartoon character. Mt Webster was so headlong on the descent that I was pretty much crawling - ended up startling a day hiker who screeched when I rounded a corner. Apparently, she had just seen a young bear about 10 minutes prior to crossing paths with me. 
I finally barreled down to the trailhead parking lot on US 302 and met some kind NOBOs who complimented my hair and gave me a blue air head and told me to watch out for a guy named Phoenix. After sitting around and playing the involuntary role of buffet for black flies, I made the executive decision to hitch 3.3 miles east to Crawford Notch General Store & Campground because I read they have showers and a solid resupply store there. A sun beam of a woman that I'd met earlier on the mountainside offered me a ride before I could even stick my thumb out. We bonded over our recent divorces and she insisted on paying for my campsite saying, ""You'll learn to accept kindness from others, my dear"". I thanked her a million times and held the ocean back behind my eyes. Lindy Jo, you are the human version of a sun flower. 
The campsite ruled. Mostly, it's a place for tourists to rent cabins, go swimming, etc. I put 4 quarters in a machine for 8 minutes of shower time and dried my hair under the Xlerator hand dryer while waiting for my phone to charge in the wall outlet... It's like, still ""roughing it"", but not entirely. :-) I also bought 4 fuji apples and 2 bananas from the General store and ate them in one sitting. Asleep by 7:30pm.

Once again, I am relieved to have waited for the rain to clear out. Even with good weather, it was windy as hell on the Kinsmans - felt like I was back in Oklahoma for a few miles. Frigid wind, to boot. And by the time you get high enough to be mauled by the wind storm, you have already passed through an un-bushwhackable bog and therefore have soaked feet. I came across one guy who had pulled off to the side of the trail & wrapped himself in a tarp to warm up. Just wanting to get it over with, I scampered across the North & South peaks as fast as possible to get back down into the trees and out of the arctic conditions. Crowds of day hikers were hovering around all the worthwhile photo spots anyways.

Don't they know I am the slack pack queen? Anyways, I used the extra time to finally do some intentional post-hike stretching. My legs rejoiced. Definitely need to be more religious about taking care of physical self. My knees are going down rapidly though - grateful to only have one more small stretch of the Whites left.

They are synonymous. Holy quads. The climb does ease up after Beaver Brook Shelter at least. And the exposed summit was beautiful and field-like. I haven't seen any like it. Sunny, clear views of the entire world again. It took less time than I expected to go up and over.. 5 hours and 20 minutes for me. This gave me plenty of time to walk into Glencliff (0.3 mi off trail) and pick up my resupply box from the Hikers Welcome Hostel and rest there for a couple hours. Charge my phone, fill up on water, eat lunch, chit chat with fellow hikers, etc. Very chill place - I had the right mind to stay the night, but decided to push forward instead. 
One of my greatest fears proceeded to happen: getting caught in a torrential downpour and then also having to set up my tent in it. I only hiked 4.5 miles from the hostel, but I was completely soaked by the time I got to the campsite. Like, taking a shower soaked. Every inch of me dripping. I couldn't believe it. So pissed, so much cursing. After some deep breathing and accepting the reality of this nightmare, the process ended up going fairly smoothly. I sat my pack under a giant pine tree while I fumbled around attempting to assemble my tent in record time. Somehow, minimal water found its way in and the biggest hassle ended up being getting out of all my drenched clothes while simultaneously using bandanas to maintain a dry sleeping space. Also dealing with wet hair.. do solar powered hair dryers exist yet? Asking for a friend.... 
Feeling victorious for mentally overcoming that stressful situation, I treated myself with a Lenny & Larry's double chocolate protein cookie for dinner. Yummmm.

They mean the world to me. Thank you. 
Random note: A NOBO dude (Primo) walked by right before the downpour hit and asked, ""Are you Rainbow by chance?""

Manny bouncing on my back as I found the adrenaline to sprint uphill, I escaped with about 7-8 stings on my lower legs and 1 on my palm. The throbbing was so fucking sharp and deep I had to just sit down and sob for a moment. My friend Zeke was hiking with me and fortunately managed to avoid the chaos after witnessing my dance of pain. 
To my relief, the trail continued to be smooth and we found a running brook about 0.6 mi ahead where I ""iced"" my legs for several minutes. Zeke shook out my socks to make sure no stingers were caught up in the fabric - thanks for that. And thank you for all the moral support. Bless.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575747,"This entry is to acknowledge my mini vacay to Burlington, Vermont which happened from Aug 16 - Aug 18. 3 zero days in a city where the population is actually over 1,000! 42,000, in fact. Oh, the possibilities of being in a location with readily available Uber drivers! Visiting the Ben & Jerry's factory wasn't my main reason for this side trip (that explanation will come later...) but it definitely happened and was fantastic. 
Okay. So, here's the thing. As intentionally as I tried to go into this journey with 0 expectations.. inevitably, they still formed. I expected euphoria and enlightenment and I expected to thrive off of a minimalist lifestyle and I expected to release my ties with depression, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders, etc. I wanted to contrast the Netflix series version of 13 Reasons Why (13 reasons why a girl committed suicide) and instead come up with reasons to stay alive. Reasons to keep going. 
I've cried from beauty and I've cried from panic. 
I've laughed at pure things and really ugly things.
I've been driven by fear, but I've also been driven by something bold in me.
My mental game has been clouded by the discomfort/unknowns of jumping directly into a completely different life than I've been living for 25 years. It's hard to get any clarity while simultaneously focusing on a superabundance of brand new stressors. 
The sensory overload finally engulfed me to the point where I needed to get away. Like, away away.
So, my real reason for Burlington = the airport. 
I'm back in Oklahoma now. 
I am okay. 
I am okay.
I am okay.
I will be back on the trail this Friday.
Until then, I have some reflecting/regrouping/reorganizing to do.

Oklahoma was perfect. Hot and flat as hell, but perfect nonetheless.

I considered extending my trip, but when the trail calls you back, the only option is to go. And so here I go.

Getting back in the groove was easy though. Vermont is so beautiful. The trail is looking a bit more rocky/rooty than it has been and so I was Bambi-ing around, having flashbacks of Maine (wheeze). My new knee braces seem to be helpful, but I'll know for sure in the morning...

Laying in my sleeping bag inside my tent before 19:00 tonight. I feel drained. It was a mental trip today during the Stratton Mountain ascent - it turned into a trail of rocks and roots just like Maine and I started having panicky flashbacks and ultimately shut down for the day. Much trudging. No energy to hold conversations. Appetite off, which is a phenomenon because normally I stress eat when any emotion has the slightest spike. Super amped? Eat. Anxious? Eat. Down and out? Eat....
I think it's more than the terrain at this point. Some darkness surfaced today regarding things like when I initially self-harmed & how an unresolved inner conflict developed after I got broken up with for the first time & the shame I've felt over untrue things, etc. 
The trail brings up much light, too. The kindness of strangers. The surprising strength we never knew we had. The overwhelming beauty of trees and sky and the symmetry it all holds. I recognize every bit of it. In the depths of my chest I ache because most days my heart is not big enough to hold so many gifts. 
But today, this is where I stand. I feel very tired and heavy. 
Side note: Shoutout to Bard for the Irish ballad serenade and to the kind NOBO, Gitfiddle, carrying a black & white kitten with him on the trail.

The struggle was real coming up Mt Greylock this morning - I have some sort of annoying head cold going on and the heavy breathing + sharp, chilly wind had my nose draining buckets. Constant sniffles put much pressure in all my sinus cavities + eyes and ears. Got about 2 miles up and sat on a mossy log with my head in my hands and thought long and hard about heading right back down to the highway.... 
I knew I'd hate myself for that decision, so I carried on - the main light being the fact that they have a lodge at the top of Greylock, meaning I wouldn't have to sleep outside during the lowest temp it's been yet.. 35 degrees. I have a 32 degree bag, so I could survive if I HAD to sleep in it.. but I'd rather embrace the lodge where they have lentil soup and wine and hot showers and warm beds amen glory hallelujah. 
Greylock itself is pretty damn awesome. Clear, sunny day so the views are stellar. Love seeing the Green Mountains of VT out there. And the upcoming Catskills of NY, etc. I have experienced much beauty & so much more is visibly ahead. These are reasons to stay. 
As the highest peak in MA (coming in at 3,491'), Greylock is apparently a popular tourist spot. Tons of people up here. And like Mt Washington in NH, a paved road winds up to the top making it that much more accessible. So many DSLR cameras hanging around necks and really cute, brightly colored hiking outfits. And kids...
Been researching some zero degree sleeping bags - if anyone has cold weather gear suggestions, by all means send them my way.

First time to hike solo in awhile. It felt both kinda lonely and kinda relieving. As a blatant introvert, I necessitate alone time to reach the best version of me.

Stepped over into Connecticut about 6 miles in. Rad. I was worried about the final 2 Mass ascents: Mt Everett & Bear Mountain. I flew over both with relative ease and took my time at the viewpoints. 
Sat on the biggest cairn pile ever (atop Bear Mtn) and chatted with some kind dayhikers, Meg & Dave, as well as crossed paths with about 43 others on the way down. Popular place, this section. And it came as no surprise since 1.) it's Saturday, 2.) phenomenal weather, and 3.) absolutely gorgeous trail!

Anyways. A mileage PR regardless. 
Though really beautiful, CT is kind of a low key bitch. Do not underestimate it. I'm learning that, like CrossFit, the trail never gets easier, it just becomes different versions of *challenging* while simultaneously hikers gain different versions of strength. Personally, my mental game has been forced, not to improve per se, but to adjust to certain realities being kinda shitty and accepting that powering through will get me to a place i want to be.. One foot in front of the other - it truly works. Unless your goal is to NOT have sore quads & glutes by the end of the day.. whew.. 
Today was rough because it was 15 straight miles of tripping downwards & then immediately wheezing back up.. over & over & over.... & over.... Got me wondering if I should have packed out my inhaler..

Q: Did you do your hair like that just for the trail??

Q: What's going to happen to it? Will it last the whole time??
A: Unsure. It may just abruptly explode. Or simply fade out. Either way. 
Q: How long does it take to get your hair like that?!
A: If by ""that"", you mean colored, it's about a 2.5 hour appointment every six weeks or so. 
Q: Is it expensive?!
A: it's a 2.5 hour appointment - I'll let you guess! :) 
Q: How do you get it that bright?!
A: Heather, my hair magician back in Oklahoma, uses a neon pigmented dye for my yellow. I also infrequently wash it, but when I do finally wash my hair after 3-4 days, I use cold water. And I wear a hat to limit sun exposure on the trail. 
Nothing super noteworthy today... well, aside from discovering a potable water spigot on the side of a stone hut at Dennytown Road. It is meant for hiker usage, which rules. Water in NY has been way more sparse than any other state thus far. There's also a red trail info booth there with a covered bench - great spot to wait out the rain.

After awhile, sometimes the only direction left to go is up. That finally became my story today. 
Hit a version of mental rock bottom when I took an Uber into Fort Montgomery last week. Got into my motel room and just sat on the floor with my back against the wall. Hands trembling.  Chest tight. Staring at nothing. It was hours before I finally picked myself up and got in the shower (normally I get on that shit first thing no matter what...). 
Holy darkness got a hold on me...
I made a video of me breaking down about all the physical discomforts of the trail.. how I have no clue what I'm doing upon completion of the trail.. the cost of the trail.. how I miss the routine & promises of my previous life before the trail, etc. 
Oh, it feels like ages though you say it's only days...
I look pretty wrecked in the video and I watched it again today and it's wild how much I'm not in that same mental space any more. Just one week later with much rest in my system and I loved the trail's roughness and the ease just alike. I'm glad I haven't quit on any of my worst days. After night comes day.. every damn time. 
Don't look back, them days are gone...
There is also much to be said about people needing other people. I owe a lot to everyone who has encouraged me in any way, and especially to those who have met me in those dark spaces that feel so isolating. Over the last couple days, I've talked with several other SOBOs who have also been lingering in this frustrating mental-block regarding their progress on the trail. Mumbles, Big Boss, Zeke, Rip and I all happened to gather at the same resting spot yesterday and ended up having a straight up bitching session about it all. Terrain, timelines, expectations, fatigue, lack of motivation, sick and tired of walking, etc. 
Follow me into the endless night (I can bring your fears to life)...
But then today we all met up at a farm general store .1 mi off trail (along with Jupiter - welcome back!), sat at a picnic table with lemonades and fruits and talked about how it's okay that we've been struggling with these things and how it truly has been a wicked amazing journey and that we are all okay with the possibility of not completing the trail because what we've been through has been magic. And we are fine with stopping often and taking it all the fuck in! 
Walt Whitman was right in his poem about the open road: ""Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first.. Be not discouraged.. I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell."" 
There ain't language for the things I've seen...
There are several of you who have been huge in bringing me back down to a place of remembering that this is a good thing. You know who you are, and just know also that I am so grateful. 
PA, we're coming for you soon!!!! 
Meet me in the woods tonight...

The chipmunks must thrive during this point in the year because I've seen SO many of them lately. Each one is the perfect mood booster. Little babies, my angels. 
My tent was dew-soaked this morning. Lame.
Picked up my re-supply box from the Unionville post office and was surprised with dark chocolate covered almonds from my sweet parents. Ate them all, post-couscous dinner, tonight.  I can take down a shit ton of food anyways, but after hiking forever.. oh god.. it's on...
Observed the highest point in NJ via the Culver Fire tower - looked like a less blatant version of the Washington Monument. Dried out my tent on the observation deck and basked in the sun and consumed yet another hummus wrap - still not tired of those. Also some bonus packs of strawberry applesauce from my resupply box. Huge. 
Solid evening at the shelter with Roots, Jupiter, Zeke, Mumbles, & Big Boss. Solitude was good, but it feels nice to be in a bubble again.

Someone told me ""Rocksylvania"" actually begins in NJ, not PA. I think they might have told the truth. It's manageable though because there are sections of rock scrambling, but also sections of leisurely pine needle strolling.. So.. It's mostly flat anyways, making the rocky portions easy to hop across fairly quickly. I say that, but my trail runners are already getting mangled at the toes from the superabundance of discreet, low-laying rock edges and petite stumps which, I swear, pop up like whack-a-mole when I'm trying to clear them. I feel like my miles are getting faster solely due to my increase of abrupt, lurching forward motions.
Dream-like weather lately. No rain on the forecast for over a week! This is good, but also means most of the water sources will continue to be dry. Grateful for all the trail magic water left at trailheads and even at some shelters. Thank you!!
Stopped in at Gyp's Tavern for lunch - about 0.2 mi off trail in Branchville, NJ. Ordered a PB&J plus a Summer Shandy (or two). Rad little place.
2 days out from Delaware Water Gap. I'm ready.

A dear friend told me about it and I think it means different things at different times - but lately it's relevant because the New Jersey sky... No doubt I've seen said sky at its finest with all of this amazingly clear weather.. it's a blue that swirls and invites free fall. I'd love to skydive here sometime. 
Now it's over. Now I'm awake.
Mid-80's during the hike today, which made landing at the Mohican Outdoor Center that much more celebratory. Clean hiker bunkhouse, showers, bathrooms, snacks, a deli, outlets to charge phones... and only 0.4 mi off trail, too. I had a bomb veggie sandwich, an apple, and two Minute Maid juices (I know those are borderline pure high fructose corn syrup, but oh well). 
No rattlesnake encounters on Rattlesnake Mountain. Few chipmunk encounters to boot. :( Just some slight sunburn action and an exceptionally tasty hummus wrap and a shit ton of ankle rolls. 
DWG tomorrow! Never had time to find a bracelet in NJ though - have gotten one for every state thus far. Sad times. Guess I'll just need to get two in PA. :)

Calculator in one hand and the Awol guide + a pen in the other... It was stressful trying to figure out ETAs months in advance, especially since I've never backpacked before and had no reference for how my pace may play out. I remember addressing a box to Delaware Water Gap, PA thinking ""wow... this is so far away."" but today I picked it up from the post office and felt like a damn champion. Done gone and made it all the way to Pennsylvania, y'all. Starting to feel kinda proud of myself. 
Much anxiety has been instilled in me due to PA's alternate name of Rocksylvania... but I'm also excited for a new challenge. Not that challenges are infrequent on the AT, but still...

Mentally, every step felt like the most tedious task I've ever had to complete. Mostly I think it was because of my dread regarding the upcoming rock-filled oblivion. And come, it surely did. About 7ish miles out from DWG, it began. Rock trail hell. Miles of every step being off-balance and me trying to keep my cool, but still low key fuming and eventually launching my trekking poles into the trees. It's only frustrating because I want to maintain a faster pace than the ongoing minefield of mini boulders allows.. And apparently it goes on this way for the next 150 miles or so... sigh. Gonna have to dig deep over the next couple weeks.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578842,"Realized one of my biggest fears is also one of my greatest dreams: allowing myself to have vulnerable and intimate relationships with other people. Was walking along a PA ridge line today and started speaking my struggles out loud. Zeke kindly listened to me go on and on about insecurities, mental isolation torment, body dysmorphia, and self-loathing. It's easy to stew about things in your own head. It's also easy for those things to quickly spiral downward with no rationality to keep it all in check. And I guess being out here makes it feel safer to expose Self because I may or may not ever see any of these humans again. Regardless, all I know is saying certain things out loud to another person allows a conversation to happen about them .. 
""I feel so fucking overweight""
""I don't understand how everyone else gets through the trail so easily"" 
""I don't have deep friendships because I always hold something back""
We're not ever as alone as we think. 
PS- PA is stunning. The rocks are just fine - nothing unbearable. Many stretches of clear. 
PPS- I've developed an opinion for the type of spider web I prefer to walk through... definitely the slightly thicker ones because they have more resistance and offer a clean break, whereas the thinner strands are too wispy and always end up stuck to every part of my face.

Similarly, which set of stars has to align in order to justify the decision to throw in the towel? All I know is the weather was perfect today and I was sitting on Pulpit Rock with incredible views... and STILL felt the urge to throw myself over the edge.
Happiness.. peace with self.. love for the Whole Thing.. these were never meant to be fulfilled through external sources. I think the trail is teaching me this more than anything. Aka, it's being drilled into my mind - and my feet - and I don't think I'll ever believe otherwise ever again. Flowers, trees, ocean skies, clear mountaintops, chipmunks.. these are magic, and worthy of every bit of gratitude - but any answers I want regarding the questions of self?

You gotta stay cool, you hot hothead...
Got so frustrated during the 3rd consecutive mile of rocks that I punched a tree trunk after tripping one too many times. Sigh. Half of my hand was swollen for the next 12 hours. Idiot.
Zeke crafted a fire at the shelter tonight. Ruled. 
Brilliant moon tonight - several owls seem to be singing to it, and maybe also to us. It's fun to believe things like that. 
I think October is the perfect month. How many people feel about christmas is how I feel about halloween. It is a nostalgic space reminding me of fall camping (glamping) trips with my family - memories revolving around smores and Mad Libs and lantern lights and Hallelujah acoustic sessions... 
Loved it.

Julia Pezant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579606,"Conclusion: I did my best. I made it 900 miles. I had enough. 
I’ve been off the AT for about two weeks now & back in Oklahoma since Friday. For me, the trail –quickly- became one of those experiences where it’s simply less about quantity and more about quality - you know? I saw and felt much wonder. I got stung 11 times by yellow jackets and tripped/fell down approximately 1,000,000. I learned about different tree bark and its relation to successful campfires. I met so many badass and warm humans. My feet felt pain they’ve never felt before. (And still do currently…). My tent once cocooned me for 16 hours straight because depression. I forgot how to breathe normally while watching a sunset from 6,289’ above sea level. I collapsed into the fetal position directly on the fallen leaf littered ground. I finessed across rivers and streams and rock scrambles and bridges and highways and swamps and mud pits. Chipmunks talked to me. I ate infinite hummus wraps and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. I considered trying to help a spider re-assemble its web after walking through on accident. I accepted healing from certain darkness in me & found my mental game is the same in the wild as it is in society. I realized enlightenment could be embraced anywhere, not just whilst wandering around in the woods with 35lbs strapped to my back.
 I hoped to be surprised. I was.
A knowledgeable friend once told me life, in all reality, is really simple. This annoyed me because no the fuck it’s not. Everything is corrupt and everyone is sheep and money isn’t even real and sometimes I can’t stop binging on mini donuts and want to self-harm and most days I feel like an awkward idiot when attempting to interact with other humans and why is everyone so easily controlled by fear and what do I do about all the orphans and homelessness, etc.
The thing is… I agree now. Life is really simple. It is one step at a time and there is weight we must carry but our bodies are stronger, bigger, capable of so much more than we want to credit them. There is no such thing as small love. Every piece of trash recycled.. every hug.. every victory with patience.. every encouragement.. every choice to be kind instead of mean.. every “me, too” and “take care” and “keep going” and “how are you really doing?”.. every step forward.. It all powerfully contributes to the Whole Thing. 
Thank you all for going on this journey with me. Thank you for the big love. I will not forget it.
I do not know what's next, but I do know I am okay with that.

I just read my own trail journal for the first time since tapping out at 900 miles or so in 2017. I've read several of my guestbook comments as well. Wow. What a beauty of a community - I had almost forgotten the magic of it all. Since being back I have healed my feet and knees, watched my trail friends complete their hikes via Instagram, attended & graduated massage school, passed the massage therapist licensing exam, found a new counselor specializing in eating disorders, checked into a psych ward, accepted a job at a chiropractic office as their onsite massage therapist, quit self-harm, developed a fulfilling love with Mark McKay, journeyed to places new to me: Minnesota, Kansas, Texas, and Belize, and am finally starting to respond in the affirmative when asked if i'd ever like to go back and finish the trail. BC has me convinced about going back and hiking the Shenandoahs this fall. So. I think I'm going to hike the Shenandoahs this fall. Hope all is well. I still revel in everything I learned from my hike and the humans who joined me there.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Fri",0
