Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556464,"April 29th is when I will be starting my section hike.I will leave Detroit after work 4/28 and drive to @ Lexington, KY. In the morning I will finish the drive to Unicoi Gap and get picked up by a shuttle to be then deposited on FR 42 near Springer Mtn. I only have a week and don't want to waste a day on the approach trail. My goal is to make it to Dick's Creek Gap but my car will be at Unicoi if I find that I cannot make it in the time I have allowed.I have my pack, sleeping bag, pad, stove, and am borrowing a tent (base weight of 10# for these items). Have to start selecting clothes although for a week I will not need much and will likely change right before due to weather considerations.Have a few things ordered from REI such as sanitation trowel, water filter.Still trying to figure out my footwear. I have a pair of merrell moab ventilators but the insert is not too agreeable with my foot. Have ordered a pair of the Salomon XA Pro 3D to try out.\Have been humming and hawing over what to take for food but it also seems I will need a bear canister too. Joy.Have not done any actual training yet but I go to my Bootcamp class 2-3 times a week and this builds up my overall strength, core and balance.",,Month an a half to go,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556615,"In 2011 I download the book, AWOL on the Appalachian Trail by David Miller.(I prefer this book to the one by Bill Bryson) I had never heard of the AT before that but was enthralled with his story. At the time my wife and I were doing OK financially but I knew that I was not the type of person who could just pick up for 4-5 months and then try to find a job after that. I always kept it in the back of my mind that I would like to attempt the AT but never got off the ground. You might say that I knew the direction I was heading as I slowly acquired a few things, backpack, sleeping bag, pad, stove, etc in the hopes of one day needing these things. They also made for a good ""Bug-out-bag"".In the summer of 2016, 4 months after changing one of my medications I started noticing issues with my joints. I first passed it off as getting old. I was now 45. But they progressively got worse. I had worked out hard over the previous winter and lost 25# but now because of the issues in my right hand, and left knee and foot I found that I was limited to walking and even that wasn't without pain. I gained 20# back on in @3 months.Essentially what was going on was similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis except it wasn't symmetrical. Once we figured out that it was the change in medication that was at fault, my doctor and my wife were trying to convince me that these issues were not permanent and could be alleviated with a change back to my previous medication. I was skeptical. I thought this was my life from now on.After the run around with my new insurance I finally was approved to start back on the previous medication. Bam, the next day I felt better and was out on my bicycle for a quick 10 mile shakedown ride, then another 25 miler the next day. I couldn't believe it. To be honest, the day I started back on the drug I started to feel better but I just assumed it was psychological, but know I think different.So now I saw what could have been. I realize that I did not face death in any way and other people are worse off than I was during that time but I got a reprieve and wanted to do something. So the decision to section hike the AT was born. My wife originally said she would do it with my but the week I chose to start (after the ""bubble"" but before it got too hot) she had to attend a conference. So I decided to start this on my own and she would hike with me the following year. She doesn't realize that each year I plan to do more miles.",,My Motivation,"Mar 16, Thu",0
Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560420,"Went out for a hike over the weekend to get a general idea if A: I could hike for 8 miles. (figured I could but....)B: Any issues with my gear.I walked with a 27# pack which should be pretty close to my pack size. I had >3 days of food and 2 liters of water. Was only missing some extra clothes.I hiked the first 5 miles in my Merrells, and the last 3.5 in my altras. Definately prefer the Altras.The only issue I had was my 1L smartwater bottle did not stay in the pocket of my pack. It fell out every 10 feet. Too tall and narrow. The 1L nalgene had no problem staying. So have to so something about that. My water filtration is made to fit the small mouth as opposed to the large mouth of the nalgenes.After trying out the filter at home (sawyer squeeze) there are no female threads on the output side of the filter it is just a sport nipple so the issue is null but I may just get a medium mouth nalgene as I like the size of the nalgene. Checked the 1L Dasani bottles that that seems to hold. Will try again next weekend.
On a side note, this morning I mixed the starbucks via into my instant oatmeal before I added the water. Whoa! that was strong. don't think I'll be doing that again.",,Shakedown,"Apr 17, Mon",0
Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561629,"I leave in 3 days. Just a few minor things to get but basically my pack is set, just deciding on a few adjustments to my food at my resupply point.My car will be parked at the 50 mile point so I can add a few more days of food to get me to the 70 mile point and beyond if I am making good time. I am now planning to ship a few days of food to the Mountain crossings outfitter so I will have that as opposed to buying.I will be driving down as far as I can on Friday night, probably to Knoxville, TN. Will finish the drive in the morning and park at Unicoi Gap, GA. I will leave my car there and get a shuttle to the nearest access point of the southern terminus. This is a fire road, 1 mile north of the terminus. I will then hike uphill the 1 mile to Mt Springer to begin my hike north.Neels Gap will be my first major crossing and supply point. The main attraction there is a large tree out front from which hang many pairs of shoes of hikers who have quit here.Next major crossing is Unicoi Gap at 50 miles, about 12 miles outside of Hiawassee GA. After that is Dicks Creek Gap at 70 miles. There is a hiker hostel w/resupply near there.After dicks creek it is 8.5 miles to the NC border. Would like to make it to NC but don't know if I have the time as there are not many places to exit the trail close to the border.",,Leave in 3 days,"Apr 25, Tue",0
Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562180,"Ok, finished packing last night. Base weight of 22.8#. Not bad. Could get it less but would have to go without a few non-essentials, like a backup battery for my phone, my kindle, a 1 person tent instead of the 2 person I am taking, thicker sleeping bag pad, newer/lighter backpack....I could go on. Overall I am happy with the weight. (base weight is total weight without food or water)Called Joyce and Sally yesterday and they got back to me later. I reserved a shuttle at noon from Unicoi Gap to the trailhead near Springer Mtn on Fire Rd 42. This puts me 1 mile below the summit/southern terminus of the AT.The fare is $95 for the @1.5hr trip. They, like others in the area, run shuttles for hikers around the AT. Kind of like Uber in GA.....Guber?",,Packed up,"Apr 28, Fri",0
Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563798,"While waiting at Unicoi gap for my ride a couple of hikers emerged from the south side of the road and worked their way past my car. I started talking to them and quickly found out that she was Mexican and he a gringo. Figures. Got picked up by the ever popular Sally at Unicoi gap at noon and she whisked me away to springer mtn. The trip took 1.5 hours but we never faltered for conversation as we both drive and love Subaru's. Lol. She gave me some good tips as well as complementing me on my preparation. I took this as a good sign. At the top of the road she pointed out the trail up springer as well as the trail north once I came down. We said our goodbyes and up I went. WTF! This wasn't a trail it was a thrown together collection of rocks! If the whole trail is like this it is going to be tough. Finally got to the top, seeing 2 other guys with the same shoes on. Either they are very good or their marketing is. Got my pic taken and signed the registry. It is in a lock book inside of a boulder. Working my way down I realized that the woman in front of me was speaking Spanish. Turns out her and her daughter are Mexican. Lol. They are everywhere. The rest of the hike was uneventful, taking Sally's advice to keep it short for the first days till I get my ""trail legs"". As I approached the 8 mile mark (marker 8 but 9 miles total because of the approach trail) there was a sign for the hawk mtn camping area. I took a chance and went a half mile further to the shelter (nobody wants to walk extra miles on the trail). Turns out there was only one other person staying at the shelter and two weekenders in bear piatas. Later on two others showed up and camped behind the shelter. Turns out the orher person in the shelter was from Ottawa Ontario. Her name is Sara and she is hiking to Damascus before going back to school. I kind of freaked her out because I asked where in Canada she was from and she had only said hi. I saw a Canadian flag luggage tag on her pack.The two fellows in the tents were Dean and D, from southern GA.  A couple of good ol' boys. Middle of the night rain rolled in. We were dry but the mist was blowing in making everything damp. Oh well, beat being in a tent. ","Springer Mtn base

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562700,We awoke to chilly temps and mist drifting through the shelter. The rain had been steady all night. Checking the weather showed a high wind advisory from 3pm to noon the next day with rain. Great. Looks like a shorter day than planned. 8 miles to gooch mtn shelter to hunker down for the night. I don't mind sleeping in the tent in the rain or wind but packing up in the rain sucks. The rain had pretty much stopped by the time I hit the trail at 9:15 but there were a lot of drops blowing off th trees. I just walked in my raincoat all day with no shirt. It would have gotten soaked with sweat anyways. Pretty uneventful hike and quickly ended u at gooch mtn shelter by 1:30. Hung out my stuff to dry and made my way down to the creek for a whores bath. It was freezing and glorious. The shelter and campsites filled up throughout the day with people waiting out the storm. Which got delayed. Hindsight I could have made it much further and found a leeward campsite. Oh well. Met some cool people and some....interesting ones. ,"Hawk mtn shelter

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562701,Once someone is up in a shelter everyone is up in a shelter. This meant I was rolling at 7:40 with a bagel in my hand. Not the easiest to eat a bagel with peanut butter while walking up hill.   The wind was blowing strong and raining til @1pm. Everything was soaked but I just kept marching in. The crossing of ramrock mtn was insane. Very narrow trail with a drop to the right. Luckily the wind was blowing from the right. I did pass two shelters today but they were in the 5 mile stretch before Neels crossing where camping/shelters are restricted unless you are using a bear canister. I did not bring one so had to march on. Calves are very tight. Been stopping periodically to stretch as well as morning and night. Sara at hawk and gooch shelters had a very small foam roller. What a great idea. Those wily Canadians!  I asked about something like that at the outfitter here and they don't have anything but most people use a water bottle or tennis ball.  I walk out side and a car had just left and there was a brand new tennis ball in the parking spot. Nice. Slight smell of dog slobber but whatever. ,"Gooch mtn shelter

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563797,"Started off the day at neels gap with a carnation instant breakfast and a microwavable biscuit sandwich. That got me going. Got extra fuel for the stove (probably didn't need but you never know) and I was off to the races. I figured 12 miles a day would be good putting me in to dicks creek gap Thursday night. Shortly after, I realized that today was going to be a high of 73 and Wednesday was going to be a high of 79. Figured to maybe push a little further to shorten the distance on the hotter day. As the day went on I kept talking myself into ""a little further"", not to mention kept mumbling ""keep on swimming"". Over and over. Now I have my Trail name ""John Dory"".  Just ""Dory"" sounds a little weird.Passing Tesnatee Gap I encountered a fellow trying to get his mtn bike up the trail. Any ""gap"" means it is going to be a steep climb out. He quickly gave up and rode down to talk to me and ask about the trail and how far it went. ""To Maine"" I replied. Turns out Luis is Costa Rican living in Ann Arbor working at sacred heart in Detroit down here on vacation. Small world.We talked for a bit and he offered me some water which I gladly accepted as I was down to a pint and had a mile uphill to go for more. The climb over the next ""hill"" was tough but glad I had the extra water. Just before hogpen gap I got passed. First time on the trail I have been passed! To many photo ops and talking to Luis. Watered up at hogpen from a rather undesirable stream and motored on eventually passing the guys that passed me. One of which was ""voyager "", a septuagenarian triple crowner. We talked for a bit then he passed me again and that was the last I saw of him. I did recognize him from neels gap. Had been camping out back. He was going to camp near blue mtn. 20 miles in one day!I figured if that old dude can do it, I should be able to. So I motored on. Keep on swimming, keep on swimming.At one point past poplar stamp gap I had about had it. Sat on a log, pack off, shoes off wondering where I should spend the night. That got me thinking about dinner.....and that I hadn't had lunch. It was @3pm. Added a caffeinated electrolyte tablet to my water and munched on a summer sausage. That did it. I took off and only started to falter when climbing blue mtn and only because the trail is so bad. It resembles a rockslide. I seriously questioned whether it was the trail or not. Made it to the shelter near the top passing a very meager water point. Signed in at the shelter but decided to get out at Unicoi gap. My car was there and I could drive in to town and get a big burrito and a margarita! They had been calling my name for 4 hours. Made it down by around 8:30, 11.5 hours straight hiking. 21.2 miles. I was beat. In the parking lot at Unicoi I ran into the slackpackimg team that I had met on springer. There was a team of 5. One would hike south, some others(don't know how many would hike north and meet up with the van. Felt good that I could keep up with a team supported by a van full of gear. Made it into the town of Helen GA which is more Bavarian than frankmuth MI. and the only restaurant open after I showered was a sports bar called big daddy's. Asked the server what he recommended and he asked how hungry I was? Ended up with a 10 oz burger topped with chili and waffle fries. It was insane. But good. Two good beers out of Atlanta to wash it down with too! Stayed in town that night. Some hotels have ""hiker"" rates. ","Neels Gap

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563814,"Woke up in the hotel in Helen GA and went down for breakfast.  The continental breakfast at the Helendorf motel is pretty basic although I was able to get cereal, juice, honey buns and some powdered donuts for the road.  They ended up being my breakfast for the next day.Got to the Unicoi Gap @9:30 and started up.  Somehow my pack had gotten heavier.  It was 35#!  These are one of the worst, pack is full and belly is full of town food and a steep climb out of a gap.  This one seemed worse than most.  When I had woken up in the morning I was wondering if I should leave my sleeping gear (tent, bag, pad) behind as well as most of my food and ""slack pack"" to make it the 20 miles to Dick's Creek Gap, repeating the previous day with less weight.I chose not to go that route and was glad I did.  The 34 miles in the last 2 days had taken a lot out of me and I was just not up to the long hike.Up and over the first mtn and I came to Indian Grave Gap.  Here I run in to a pair of women section hiking SOBO.  They are Giggles and Shakes.  After talking about the trail for a few minutes they convince me to go with Tulach Ard as my trailname as it has more of a story to it.  They had started at Deep Gap and were going to Neels Gap, having spent the previous night at Tray Mtn Shelter.Up the next mtn which was Tray Mtn.  Close to the top I passed a fellow I can only remember as Nugget.  He is a personal trainer from Florida trying to hike the whole thing.Tray mtn shelter was nice and sunny in the area but seemed to be a lot of flies.  Seems they were all from the privy which did not have a roof as most privies did and was fully exposed to the hot sun.  It was horrid!  Glad I didn't need to use it.Shortly after I crossed the ""Swag of the Blue Ridge"" which is the gap between Tray mtn and Dismal mtn.Coming up next was Sassafras gap and then Addis Gap.  Both have good water sources but according to Guthooks App, the water source at Sassafras is down a very steep hill so I chose Addis Gap which had a water source slightly farther away but a much more manageable downhill to the water. Not!  There was a nice camping area at the gap but I started downhill with full pack to get water.  Turns out it was .5 miles downhill.  There was a nice camping area down near the stream but so far off the trail I felt I should proceed back uphill to the other camping spot.  So I wouldn't have to do the climb in the morning and ""Leave No Trace"" principles dictate that you not camp near water.Set up my tent, hung my clothes out to dry off and made dinner.  Nugget strolled in and made camp next to me a few hours later.  He was smart and left his pack at the campsite before getting water.  Hung my foodbag and off to bed by @8:30","Unicoi Gap

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563799,"Light rain woke me up early at Addis Gap so figured it was time to head out. Packed up quickly and was on the trail by 6:30.  Nugget got a head start on my by about a half hour.  I figured I could make it to top of GA hostel by 10 am. I made it to Dicks creek gap by 9:30 and starred down the road to the hostel. I only needed some Gatorade powder or something of the sort. I lucked out and was picked up by the hostel van on the way there. Walked in the door and right off they offer you a soda or coffee or hot chocolate! While I enjoyed my Dr. Lara (a local dr pepper) I talked to the owner and made a reservation for the next evening.  They had been full up the past two nights due to the weather. I got a Gatorade and lucked out with a ride back to the trail. 4.5 miles later got me to plum orchard gap shelter. A 3 story structure right off the trail. I wanted to push on but it was already a 10 mile day and I am already ahead of my schedule. Tomorrow I will slackpack up to the border and turn around and go back to the TOG hostel. With me tonight in the shelter are Rachel (glacier Swiss) the ridge runner and her bf James(corn silk). It is windy and cold so all three of us are up in the loft of the shelter. Joined later by Grade school( Jen from gooch gap and neels gap) , heat wave, P.O.,","Addis gap

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588378,"The day started out well with a trip up and down a road know as the tail of the dragon. Groups of cars and motorcycles kept passing us going the other way. The cars were all grouped together. A bunch of sti’s, mx5s, Porsche’s,etc. turns out this road is known for the twists and turns and groups come to drive it. There were even photographers at a number of the turns. Once we got to Fontana dam and parked we transferred our packs to the waiting Subaru (of course) for the trip to deep gap and the start of our journey. That was not to be as a gravel hauler had made a wrong turn and was now stuck part way up this very arrow dirt road. Now we had to find a new place to drop into the trail as I didn’t think Maricela was up to the extra miles. We were dropped off at the head of timber ridge trail and started up. This is a steep and technical trail that does not see much use. It took us 2 hours to get to the top where it intersected the AT. Just a short walk later we got to the shelter where we were planning to spend the night. Maricela felt good enough to go on for the 4 miles it would take to get to the next campsite. She barely made it. We got settled in, made dinner, chatted with our fellow campers Speck, Colleen, Kyle, chandler, and Byron. Maricela hit the hay by 8:30 and I was shortly behind her.

Much later than I would have liked but I was misinformed about the timing of the local transit bus. Once we got going we got into a good rythym me leapfrogging a hard and then waiting for Maricela to catch up. At one point I was passed by Joe. He asked if I was from Detroit too. I assumed he had talked to Maricela on the way past. Turns out he just saw my tigers cap and since he was from Rochester realized I was likely from m the Detroit area.We stopped at silver bald shelter which was a very bad idea as it was a tough hill down for no point other than to rest and get water. We could have gotten water just a bit further on the trail. I figured Despacito would want to stop as this was 8 miles but she chose to push on. Unfortunately the next few places where it was flat enough to camp she felt it was too close to the road (fire service rd) so we ended up pushing on to the top of the next mountain. That made it 12 miles for the day. Not including the drop in and out of siler bald shelter. Joe was at the camp site along with crybaby, pinky, two others whose names I can’t recall and a dog, Luna. We made it just in time as we had enough light to set up the tent and make dinner. Had to save the hunt for water till the morning. Dinner consisted of ramen with a Tuna packet.

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588831,Second one up in camp but couldnt really start breakdown till joe in the next tent was moving. Got the bear bag from the tree and started on breakfast. Breakfast consisted of two packs of Quaker instant oats with a handful of raisins.  We both had one and was great to have a warm breakfast after a cold night. Shortly after leaving camp we crossed wayah bald which has a nice watch tower with some great views!  We could see the tower on Albert mtn where we were two days ago. Couldnt believe how far we had walked in two days. Met a nice woman hiking with her two boys. They were waiting on a shuttle into franklin to take care of some gear issues. The remainder of the day was fairly uneventful except at the cold creek shelter we found out there were a number of people heading for the same small campsite. So the choice was to stay at the shelter putting us at 8 miles for the day or take our chances that we could squeeze in an big creek camp site. As it was we got a spot although it slopes a little and I ended up against the side of the tent all night. Our dinner was a backcountry pantry meal of tikka masala. Was pretty good although it gave me a lot of gas. Maricela has decided for the sake of our marriage that she will get off the trail at the Nantahala Outdoor Center and let me go one alone to Fontana Dam by myself.

Tulach Ard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588984,Got up at 8 in order to get breakfast and  take care of the reservation for the room for the next two nights. Turns out they are booked Friday night but was able to get Thursday night but at the discounted rate I paid last night. Bonus!  With that taken care of I dropped Maricela off for her day of adventure. Now I headed up to our cabin to collect my bag and get one the trail. The AT runs right below our cabin so I was on the trail by 10:15. The trail out of NOC is a 5 mile climb rising 3000 feet. It sucked. I started at @ 3 miles an hour but the incline increased and I quickly dropped in speed. Halfway up I ran into Gump Candy at the first spring we came to.  He is the owner of the cute dog Luna from a few days ago. We leapfrogged for the next few miles till he stopped for water again. I had gotten 3 liters of water at the first stop so kept on going. I didn’t see him again. Throughout the day I passed a number of people including the woman dropped of at wayah gap the same morning that we were dropped off at rock gap. I realized that I was way ahead of schedule so I figured out how to change things up.  I determined that I could push on to yellow creek mountain rd and get picked up one hour later than if Maricela was picking me up at stecoah gap. Once I reached stecoah gap I had to go down the hill a bit to get water. Once that was accomplished I texted the new plan to Maricela and started out. I ended up at yellow creek mountain rd 20 minutes later than I planned. Not bad. This put my day at 21.1 miles in 9 hours.  Averaged 2.3 mph. Not bad considering the long climb. Back at the NOC we cooked up camp food as everything closes at 7 around here and it is a dry county so I couldn’t even get a six pack.
