Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554267,"This is my first entry. I am planning on a late February northbound (NOBO) start at Springer Mountain. I would like to start on February 20th but now see a good deal from the Hiker Hostel near Woody Gap that would entail pick up at the Amtrak station in Gainesville, breakfast, overnight stay in a bunk and then shuttle to Springer Mountain. Will call tomorrow to see what can be arranged.
Otherwise, I am still working on equipment, food and figuring out the logistics of this undertaking. I may do less planning and more trailside decisions regarding when to get off the trail to go to town for resupply, laundry, shower and zero days (day off the trail and in a bed). It might be better and less stressful to just wing it and see what happens.
All is well.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555268,"I returned home on Friday because of my father's ill health. He had been in the hospital for about a week when his health declined rapidly on Friday. I had stopped to see him in the hospital last Wednesday and he seemed stable and we still had hope that the pacemaker could be implanted but because of various issues that was no longer feasible. He no longer wanted to stay in the hospital and no longer wanted to take all of his medicine so Hospice is now involved. He is comfortable but weak and very thin and he sleeps a lot. I probably should not have gone last week but everyone said to go for it. It has been a rough couple days but family, friends and relatives have been ever present and that makes this much easier. On Friday I could see the ridge line where the AT traverses from the Hiker Hostel in Georgia. So close...I hope to return but cannot say for sure when obviously.I will try to update this every couple days or so.","

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555647,My Dad died last night at 8:30. He slept comfortably the night before and I slept in his room on the floor. Yesterday when the hospice nurse came in and turned him because of bed sores on his side things started to go downhill for him. He struggled to breathe so we raised him to a sitting position and had to give him morphine more often. My family was there when he died and we all had a chance to say goodbye. In a sense then his death was a relief. His funeral is this coming Friday. Family members ask when I intend to return to Georgia to start my attempt at an AT thru hike. I have not decided yet when to return but think it will be early next week. My brother-in-law broached the idea that he and my sister may do a road trip to Savannah Georgia and that I could then hitch a ride with them to Amicalola Falls. I like that idea though I wonder if it might be better to fly down next week and get on the trails soon as possible. I now have one more reason to finish this--do it in my Dad's honor.,"

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556081,"Today was my father's funeral mass. It was a long, tiring day and I feel it is important to make a journal entry late this evening. I am at my Mom's place where I have been staying for the past week or so to keep her company now that Dad is gone. It is quiet now save for the ticking clocks. The support from relatives and friends the last couple days has been wonderful. It was a joyous and raucous affair at the funeral home last night, today before mass, at the luncheon afterward and the smaller gathering at the center where my Mom lives. Dad's name was Daniel. He went by Dan. Rarely Danny. Even though I knew ""Danny Boy"" would be sung at the end of mass it was still hard to keep back tears.I have made plans to return to the Hiker Hostel on Sunday and plan to start NOBO on Monday. I feel more pressure now. I will do my best.","

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556339,It is about 9:00 am and am still in my tent. I hiked about 12 or 13 miles yesterday and am on a ridge line above Cooper Gap. My goal was to get at least to Cooper Gap but I was very tired and was having an issue with a cramp in my quad just above my knee so it was time to stop. I found a nice place to set up camp all by my lonesome. Had considered the Hawk Mt site. Stopped to get water there just in case I decided to camp up high where there would not be water. There was only one guy there at that point but by the time I walked back the side trail where all the tent sites are there must have been 10 people including Ashby and Brian. Springer Mt was neat yesterday. All the trees were covered in rime ice that tinkled like delicate glass as it fell in the wind .I Made dinner last night in mist then a spooky fog rolled in. Overnight it rained then snowed and it is now very windy. Winds blew most of the night. Will wait a while to break camp. Snowing/sleeting a bit now but looks like it should stop soon. Will have to camp low the next 2 nights as it is going to be cold.,"Springer

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556594,Coming down off Blood Mt. on the way to Neel Gap I slipped on ice and injured my shoulder. It's bad. I cannot lift my arm. The attempt is over. I am so disappointed. I suppose I am lucky--it could have been worse.,"

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556789,"I finally am in the mood to update what happened to me on Wednesday. I am home now after I slipped on the icy trail coming down Blood Mountain.First, on Tuesday I did not start hiking until about 11:30 because of the weather. It was still snowing. I probably should have gotten going earlier but as it was my first night out it took a while to figure out how to deal with the conditions. When coming out of the woods I encountered a group of 3 hikers and the lead woman asked if I took a short cut. I said no that I had camped back there. I'm not sure she believed me. Anyway I hiked on that day about 9 miles to Woody Gap. It got progressively colder and windier and by the time I got to there it was like January! There were some fantastic views at Liss Gap and Ramrock Mountain along the way. Just before getting to Woody Gap a couple hikers passed me going the other direction. The one fellow stopped and we spoke a bit. He was from Atlanta and heard the weather report of snow, cold and wind and decided to come up to camp for the night! Good for him. He knew the conditions would result in a great view and I told him it was beautiful. The other guy did not stop to talk as he appeared to be on a mission. He just had a day pack and I assume he was a photographer on his way to get some nice sunset pictures. I'll try to upload some of the photos I took from Ramrock Mt. with my small Canon camera when I get home and download them. I set up camp at Woody Gap just back from Georgia Route 60 in an area sheltered by a rock ledge. 3 or 4 other hikers set up camp there. Dinner was difficult to make in the cold but I finally was able to make a delicious and filling meal--just what was needed. It was really cold and windy that night and my tent flapped quite a bit.   The howling wind made it hard to sleep. I was a bit cold but got   through the night OK. Again, it was so cold in the morning that it took until 11:30 to get on the trail again. That is not good enough.I reviewed my guide and map in the tent that Wednesday morning and figured I had a couple options. The next night would be cold again I knew. I could make it a short day of about 4 miles and stop at Lance Creek or push on to Neel Gap about 11 miles away. I arrived at the Lance Creek campsite about 1:30. It was a very nice protected cove with good access to water. In retrospect I should have stopped, set up camp and enjoyed the solitude because I did not see many people that morning. At the time though I felt I could make it over Blood Mountain and reach Neel Gap in time to set up camp so I went for it. It was a tough walk up Blood Mountain (I think the highest point in Georgia--the trail does not go right over the top though I don't think). I spent a bit of time on top and actually called home for a bit. I did meet some younger people on the way up. I believe they were on spring break and were doing a loop hike for a day or so around the mountain using the AT and side trails. The trip down was difficult with a lot of obstacles.   At one point there was a big boulder field to contend with. I was mindful on the trail to that point and tried different techniques to be safe. The mistake happened fast. I started to think about how I would set up camp when I got to Neel Gap and how I was almost out of water and that I could melt some snow if need be. In that moment I lost concentration on the trail and slipped and went down so fast that I must have put my right arm down to brace my fall and instantly felt pain in my shoulder. I don't want to repeat here what I said as I lay on the trail. I knew instantly that my attempt was done. The pack was still on my back so I could get up and hike to Neel Gap. By the time I arrived the sun was going down and it was getting real cold. There was a hostel there at US Route 19 and I struck up a conversation with a couple hikers who were outside the hostel. The hostel was full. One of the guys was a fellow called Onestick. He was waiting to go in to stay on a work for stay arrangement. He would do about and hour or so of cleaning in the hostel in exchange for a stay there for a couple nights. The other guy suggested that I call a fellow known as Apline to get a ride to the Atlanta area. That did work out and I eventually arrived in Dunwooody north of Atlanta in a hotel there. While waiting for the ride I struck up a conversation with Onestick. He was an interesting cat. I gave him most of my food, my tarp and my water treatment figuring this stuff was expendable and would lighten the load going home. He was very appreciative. I even arranged for him to pick up the box I had mailed to the Top of Georgia Hostel up the trail at mile 69. He thanked me in a text for the ""trail magic"". Hopefully I'll run into Onestick, Ashby, Brian etc. one day on the trail.I went to my family doctor yesterday and he feels I won't be able to do any hiking for 6-12 months. They will try to get approval for an MRI next week and to see an Orthopedic doc. I'll know more then and will post once I know more. My doctor gave me some exercises to do and the shoulder feels better. Unfortunately I cannot lift my arm very high. For sure not above my shoulder.It is hard to express how disappointed I am. I feel this is a big failure and that I have let so many people down. It's just how I feel. My mind is still in the trees. I feel a bit unmoored. I had spent so much time, money and effort in planning this trip and it is just so frustrating to have it all end on one stupid slip. Hopefully I'll get out of this funk. Obviously I won't be able to swim but can walk so will be doing a lot of that in addition to my exercises.I'll post a new entry when I have more information about my shoulder. Check out my photos--there will be new ones in I think today and later once I download the photos from my camera.","Sassafras Mt. Ridgeline

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557770,"I am not sure is anyone is checking on my journal but here goes: I had the MRI last Thursday and saw the orthopedic surgeon this morning. Bad news. I tore the Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus tendons off the bone and will need surgery. It will be scheduled soon. I'll be out of commission with my right shoulder for quite a long time. 6-8 weeks before any rehab/therapy. I'm a swimmer so this is extra devastating. The surgeon did say that I can walk so there is that at least.A couple corrections/clarifications: I forgot to mention earlier that I started at Springer rather than the approach trail as I was not in the best shape because of the issue with my father so did not want to start with and 8 mile 2,000 foot elevation gain. Also, I was mistaken about Blood Mountain. It is not the highest mountain in Georgia. It is the highest mountain in Georgia that the AT crosses.I will keep up this journal for a while for those who are interested. When I'm feeling better I might drive up to Boiling Springs or Duncannon and do some trail magic. I might decide later this summer to go out on the trail for a few days. I really do not think I'll attempt a thru hike next year as I am a huge soccer fan and the World Cup its next year and I still have hope that I can go to Russia. Not sure if anyone is interested in going--I don't really want to go alone. I know Russia is problematic now but I can't resist. It was so much fun being in Brail for the last World Cup. Maybe I'll attempt a thru hike in 2019 but kind of doubt it at this point. This attempt had been so frustrating I'm not sure it is worth the effort again.As I mentioned previously this has me in a big funk. Hopefully I'll come out of it in time.I am still trying to get a few photos that were taken with the small Canon camera that I took in addition to my iPhone. I am having problems linking the photos using the Aurigma Up site and am working with them to resolve this issue. Hopefully they will be on here soon.Take care all,Mattman","

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559027,"I turned 60 today. I had hoped it would have been on the trail. The surgery on my right shoulder is scheduled on Monday April 10th. A couple things: First, I realized a couple weeks ago that the injury happened on March 15th--the Ides of March. Et tu, Brute. My Dad would often use that expression in a joking manner. During his last week my niece's finance Bret walked in to see Dad and Dad greeted him with ""Et tu, Brute"". Always the jokester. Second, I have been working to get the pictures I took with my small Canon point and shoot camera on this site. It has been problematic but think I have figured it out with some help from Aurigma Up. This is the company that Trailjournals uses to upload photos. I have been able to use my iPhone to take pictures and upload them all along. I find that photos in my library must be added to the iCloud drive before Aurigma Up can recognize them. My next goal is to get a cable to directly download photos from the camera to my phone rather than going through my laptop. I will have to find out if such a cable exists. It will make things a lot easier. I will continue to add photos to this journal and add entries as I intend to go back one day to hike the trail again. The photo on this entry is of a Bloodroot flower in my yard. I put an entry on the photo about this. There is still an issue with putting a caption on the pictures. Leif of Trailjournals let me know that they are working on this site to resolve this. The problem has something to do with the new iPhone 7.Lastly, I want to thank all of those who have entered words of sympathy and encouragement on my journal. It means so much to me that you took the time to reach out and offer positive words in this difficult time.

Dropped off some water on the trail again.  I wonder how many water sources there are on this part of the trail in PA.  I hiked about 4 miles.  It was not very interesting other than a couple nice views.  There was one very rocky stretch.  Not much bird life and the plant life was not varied.  Doubt I'd hike there again.  Hope to go next to the Hawk Mt and Micheux State Park areas for day hikes this week (I am entering this on Monday June 10th).  Once I find some nice places to hike I'll invite friends and relatives to come along to hike and participate in some trail magic.,"Day hike
