LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577835,"Day 1 was not easy but very rewarding. It started with a carpool from my nephew Elijah to N. Adams MA to drop my car off. He then drove me to the trail head near Great Barrington and hiked the first 3 miles with me before having to leave. Thank you Elijah!
It then got harder with a mile long up hill section. My 35 lb pack felt like 40. I managed to make it bit was soaked thru at that point and opted to go shirtless. 
I then had an awesome view from the Ledges looking south toward moint Everet and beyond. 
The rest of the hike seemed like work because we got a late start and I had a total of 10.3 miles to hike. I was also low on water and optes to skip lunch to make the water last. 
I arrived at the Shaker campsite at 4:30 PM, which gave me plenty of time to get and filtee water, setup my tarp over the tent platform and cook dinner. Beef Stroganoff abd mint tea. Yum.
I then mabages to start a firs in the pit and had to use tissue and chap stick because the wood was still damp from the rain the prior day. Oddly enough a dry 30 foot branch came crashing down right near the pit and I broke it up. It burned nicely for about 3 hours. I then cleaned up the site, pit the food in the bear box and went to bed. 
I just hope I can sleep well. There could be bears visiting so I'm somewhat nervous. Lights out at 8:45. I'm here alone. Good night!","Great Barrington

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577946,"Day 2: Shaker Campsite to Upper Goose Pond Cabin
The day started at midnight with the sounds of small creatures roaming around my tarp. Around 1:00 a few hunting dogs chased a bear up a tree about 100 yards from the site. They barked and growlers for an hour and finally left. I think I finally slept from 2:00 to 6:00.
I made some instant coffee and broke camp while drinking it. I then made some scrambled eggs and bacon bits from a dehydrated pack.
I then figured out a way to pack everything in my larger pack, which made it feel 5 lbs lighter than yesterday, when I had the food on a small pack strapped to the back. I hit the trail at 9:00 AM. 
After the first mile I entered the Tyrington Cobble Reservation. I hike up hill for about a half mile, then it leveled off and I took some noce pics of the wildflowers and fog covered valley. The trail thendropped down hill for a half mile and leveled out for about a mile over farmland and bridge covered wetlands. 
Along the way I passed 3 SB hikers, 
Aistocat, Mr. T and Silly Spilly and Trail maintainer Scout Leader who I thanked wholeheartedly. Pics forthcoming. Total distance 9.6 miles.
The trail then started ascending Mt. Wilcox with nealy a 1200 foot elevation gain in 1.5 miles. About a half hour later I was 5.5 miles into my day. After a quick snack I resume the hike. Around the 9 mile mark I found the blue blaze trail and hiked a half mile to the cabin. All AT trail guides call this the Hilton of cabins, best of all its free. Donations accepted.
At the cabin I rehydrated and took a swim in the lake about 100 yards from the cabin. I then changed into my leisure clothes, made some herbal tea and sociizes witha few people that were staying there.
In all about 8 people total were in the cabin, two with a dog camping at the adjacent campground. Liz and Wayne were the caretakers on dutty and kept the cabin clean and fresh. I don't recall everyone else's names.
After a dinner of rice and tuna I had some hearbal tea and socialized with the other hikers, all of whom were hikeing the whole AT southbound. I then took a Motrin for the pain aroind my neck caused by my pack and weny to bed. I awake several times to the sound of a few Bard Owels. Other than that I managed to get a good night's sleep.","Shaker Campsite

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577980,"Day 3: Upper Goose Pond Cabin to October Mountain Shelter. 
My day started around 7:00 AM with the smell of pancakes oozing up from the kitchen. I made my way downstairs to find a few hikers eating them. Since I'm going for a non supported hike I could not accept any. However, I did enjoy my Starbucks instant coffee and double serving of oatmeal that I brought. 
By 9:30 I had packed my pack, said my goodbyes and started hiking. I had to hike a half mile extra to get back on the AT. 
The first few miles were downhill into the town of Lee, where I passed over the Mass turnpike and started and started a 2 mile ascent to the top of Becket Mountain. I ate my energy bar there and rested a while enjoying the cool mountain breezes. 
I changed into a dry shirt and started hiking along the ridge to Finerty pond. It was a fairly large pond, which we would call a lake in CT. The sun was shining, breeze was blowing and I had the place to myself. I took a few pictures and shot video.
The last 4 miles were along the ridge at about 2000 feet elevation. There was a nice breeze, no bugs and birds chirping the entire way. The trail was dry and very nice to hike on. It was perhaps the best trail section I had hikes thusfar. 
Along the hike I met a half dozen SB Day Hikers. I then met a very young man that was hiking the entire trail. I asked him his trail name. He gave me a puzzled look and asked me what that was. I described the concept to him. He bewildering say that he would have to come up with a name when the time was right.
Shortly after I met a retired man that had hike the entire trail this year. He liked it so much that he decided to turn around and hike it southbound. His trail name was Dr. John. Both men loooked like a Jimmy to me so I named them Dr. Jimmy and Mr. Jim, names that I head from a Who rock song that came out in the early 70s. Can you name the song? Album?
I also passed an elderly woman who looked to be about 75 who's trail name was Hope. She was hopeful that she could make the remaining 1600 miles to GA. I wished her luck and told her that I would pray that she finish it.
I made it to the shelter by 3:30 after hiking 9.3 miles for the day. I was happy to discover that I was the first one there. I hung my wet clothes out to dry, put my food in the bear box and found some water in a nearby stream. I filtered about 2 liters, returnes to the shelter, and made some mint herbal tea while enjoying the peace and solituded that I had earned.
While writing this entry a young husband and wife entered the camp. They opted to setup a tent a 100 feet away.
I made some mint herbal tea to relax and cooked up another batch of beef stroganoff from the kit. After dinner I put all my food and trash in the bear box and made a cup of Sleepy Time tea to help me get to sleep sooner.
That couple never came back to the shelter so I might have ot to myself after all. It sleeps 4 on the bottom and 6 in the loft. Pics forthcoming. 
In order to get to Bennington by Sunday I have to skip a shelter. The weather looks good tomorrow and the first 9 miles are along the ridge. Hence, I'm going to attempt the full 16.5 miles tomorrow with an early 7:00 start. I should arrive at the skippwd shelter 9.2 miles in where I will stop for lunch and do a sanity check. Let's hope I pass. 
Its almost 7:00 now and getting dark. Time to hop in the sleeping bag and get some shut eye for my big hike tomorrow. Please wish me luck.The picture is that of a country road that the trail passed over. There were several such roads along the hike. It reminds me of the Country Roads song that I sang along the way.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578044,"Day 4 started with a good night's sleep in the shelter. I really needed that for the 16 miles ahead. I awoke at first light, made coffee and scrambled eggs. I packed up and put all the gear and clothes that I did not need onto my day pack. I then packed my main pack and started hiking by 7:15, nice and early.
Knowing I had a long hike ahead I tried to make the most fun out of it. I was able to get enough phone signal to download the song lyrics of Do Wa Ditty. After about an hour of singing I finally memorized it. It's a good thing an Army recruiter did not pass by or he would have tried recruiting me. 
Enough of torturing the wildlife. I then played some John Denver and Christian rock songs to put my mind at ease. I passed a few southbound thru hikers and some day hikers. I did not ask for their names except for a retired man named Jim. A coincidence? Having experienced some cold weather in the White mountains already they seemed in a rush to get south.
About 10 miles in I arrived in Dalton. It was 1:30. I made my way to the Post Office to get the food I had shipped ahead and sent back all the stuff I no longer needed. The net difference made my pack 5 lbs lighter. I then walked along the trail in Dalton, took a few pictures and found the trailhead about 1.5 miles later. It felt noce to be walking upright again. 
The first mile included 500 feet of elevation change up hill. I had to eat a jelly energy bar to give me the boost needed to make it. The next 2.5 miles was more gentle uphill and another 500 feet gain. I was the first to arrive at the campsite at 4:10.
I quickly found the spring and filtered 2 liters of water. I drank one right away. I then setup my tarp and hammock and put wet clothes out to dry. As usual I made some herbal tea to relax my sore muscles a bit. I then cooked up some rice and tuna for dinner. 
By then a young lady hiker named Jane from England hiked in and told me she was staying at the site for the night. Her trail name is Calamity. She is from England and in the States to hike the entire trail southbound. At last I had some company. 
After she setup her tent we chatted while she ate. A few minutes later an elderly man named Ross hike in and told us he was staying also. Like me, he is section hiking north. I already discovered we are staying at the same shelter tomorrow night at over 3,000 feet elevation.
Around 7:30 the conversation stopped. Jane and Ross retired to their tents and I retired shortly after. I still miss my family, cold lite beer, hot showers and clean clothes. I will definately need a few Motrin to fall asleep. Lets hope no bears come into the site.","October Mountain Shelter

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578093,"Day 5, Hump Day
The day started with a 7:00 AM wakeup. It was very windy last night and the rustling trees made it hard to sleep. Sleeping in the hammock again was super uncomfortable so I'm guessing I got 4 hours of sleep tops. The thought of stopping my hike 2 days early crept into my head. I then rationalized that I should make any firm decisions after a poor night sleep. After all, the weather forecast is for partly sunny skies starting tomorrow.
Jane and Ross were already up breaking camp. I managed to have some breakfast with them before packing up and heading out at 9:00 AM. We were all happy that it did not rain overnight and we had a cool and cloudy day to hike. 
I started the hike slowly with Ross and took a break every hour to ensure he was okay. This lasted the whole 4 miles down the ridge because he had a knee brace on and could not keep up. The hike down took 4.5 hours, a hike that I could do in two hours or less.
While waiting for him I realized that its the Christian thing to do to help a friend in need, so I really did not mind waiting. With any luck we will still get to the next shelter before dark. I took advantage of the time alone to memorize a few John Denver songs. 
I waited for Ross at the first stop sign. We walked thru town together for 1 mile at a good pace. Once the trail resumed we walked thru a corn field and then back into the woods. These 10 to 15 minute breaks are good for my feet and give me time to journal. 
When Ross caught up to me we rested for 10 minutes with shoes and sox off. It felt great! Yet another lesson from Ross. We then agreed that I should go ahead at my normal pace so I could get to the shelter early, get settled in and make a fire with the birch bark I had collected on the trail. 
The first mile with 1,000 elevation change was grueling. It then leveled out for a half mile. The last 2 miles were a gradual ascent with 500 feet elevation gain. I finished then quickly and arrived at the shelter at 4:00.
After claiming a lower loft in the shelter I filtered a few liters of water and drank one. I then spent about an hour foraging for firewood. Without an ax or saw it was challenging. I then brewed up some herbal tea. As soon as it was ready Ross came onto camp around 5:30. He was about an hour ahead of what I estimated. Good thing for him as he barley had enough time to prepare his dinner and cleanup before dark. 
After dinner I setup a laundry line next to the campfire so I could dry oit met sweat soaked clothes before retiring for the evening. It seems to be working well.  It should be dry in an hour allowing me to go to bed by 9:00.
I noticed the wind picking up so I decided to hike 500 down hill to the Spring to get 3 liters of water to put out the fire. It wasnt easy finding it in the dark but I managed. I then notice the previous occupants had left a bag of trash with peanut butter in it. I just had to put that in the bear box to be safe. I will dispose of it in the morning at the visitor center at the summit. 
The forecast for tomorrow is mostly sunny. It should be good weather to complete the ascent on Mt. Graylock. We are just 3 miles and 750 feet from the 3,500 foot peak, which is the tallest peak in the state.","Kay Wood Shelter

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578207,"Day 6: Summit Day
The shelter kept the wind off us making for a good nights sleep. Ross and I awoke at dawn and enjoyed breakfast together. I learned that he just turned 60. Like me, he's fairly new at backpacking. Time to pack up and head for the summit, just 3 miles away and 1,000 feet of elevation up.
We hit the trail around 8:30. It took us nearly an hour to hike the first mile, which included 500 feet elevation gain. Along the way I found a patch of blackberries that I feasted on until Ross caught up. From here it's was 2.5 miles to the summit. 
I discovered several other benefits to hiking slowly. There is more appreciation for the trail and surroundings. As Miley Cyrus empasized in one of the songs she sang, life is about the Climb. 
""Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb, yeah!""
- The Climb, written by Jon Mabe
Other than the gentle breezes its very quiet up here. Silence is nourishment for the soul. It unveils the riches of solitude. This reminds me of a song written by Paul Simon in 1964 named the Sound of Silence. After all other sound is removed, that's whats left, just the sounds from your memories and imagination. It also reminds me of some John Denver song lyrics.
""Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.""

- Rocky Mountain High
Yay. I made it to the summit by 11:15. I then entered the newly renovated war memorial and admired the interior signeage. I then proceeded up the 90 steps to the top to see for miles and miles. Remind you of a classic Who song?
Around the base there are pictures that point out all the towns, mountains and ranges visible from the top. Starting east and continuing north you can see the Berkshire hills, CT river valley, Mount Monadnock in NH, the Green mountains in VT,  Adirondack mountains in NY,  Taconic Mountain range, Hudson river valley, Catskill Mountains in NY and Mount Everett in S. MA. 
By the time I made it to the lodge Ross had just summited. We had a snack out on a bench by the lodge, refilled out water bottles and said our goodbyes before departing. I knew I could make it down in half the time on my own and still had a good 8 miles to go to the campsite. I still had 8.5 miles to go. He only had 6 and was finishing his 4 day hike. 
Within an hour I had covered nearly 3 miles. So much for taking it easy. I was now on a mission to get down the mountain as quickly as possible without injury. I passed a shelter along the way but it was .3 miles off the trail and I was not going to hike an extra .6 miles just to check it out. 
I had passed by two smalller peaks and was now just 3 mipes from rt. 2 and 5 miles from my campsite. The next 2 miles wewe straight downhill. The last mile was fairly level. Thank God!
As soon as I got to rt. 2 in N. Adams I decided to end the hike. I had spent 6 excellent days on the trail sleeping in 3 sided shelters, campsites abd a cabin. I had me people fro all walks of life, ages and occupations. The trail was not going anywhere and I could continue hiking it later in life. 
""I think I'm going to go home now.""
- Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump
In some ways this hike reminds me of the 1999 box office movie hit, The Matrix. In this movie a Computer Programmer named Neo is awoke to reality by taking a pill.
""You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."" The term redpill refers to a human that is aware of the true nature of the Matrix.

Needless to say, I took the red pill and awakened to a new world away from the reality I had known prior. 
Thank you all for taking the time to read my trail journal entries. I hope you found them to be educational and uplifting.
Special thanks to everyone that prayed for me and my family while I was away. I'm sure it made a difference.

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578397,"This hike was a good challenge for me, spiritually and mentally. I hiked a lot in my youth with the scouts, but that was 40 years ago. During the past year I saw dozens of videos and read hundreds of product reviews to get equipment for the hike. For the past several months leading up to it I hiked 3 to 4 times a week between 6 to 8 miles per hike. I hiked with a pack full of water bottles to simulate the load I would be carrying on this hike. It was a lot of work and sweat, but paid off. As a bonus I lost 20 pounds and another 5 pounds on the hike. 
In retrospect, I'm glad that I shortened the hike from 9 days to 6 days. That was enough time to get a taste of what it's like on the trail as he thru hiker many of the thru hiker blogs I read indicate that they would hike anywhere from 4 to 6 days before taking a day off at a hostel or hotel. 
Shortening the hike left me with 3 vacation days at home to clean up, paint my daughters room and spend some time with my family.
I feel that this journey was a big success. I know I did a lot more things well than poor. I prepared myself physically and mentally. I brought enough equipment and food and kept myself well nourished and hydrated at all times 
In 2018 I hope to spend some vacation time hiking north and completing the AT in Vermont. THe distance is approximately a 150 miles which I feel I can cover in 2 weeks. The trail there is often muddy so I will wait till early or mid fall before hiking it. It would be nice to complete the AT in New England in the following years. That will take additional time and commitment. I believe the distance in New Hampshire is a 170 miles. Maine is over 250 miles. In all, there are over 600 miles of the trail in New England, more than a quarter of the total trail length.
I would like to thank all my readers. I Hope you found my journal to be informative and exciting. I also want to thank Elijaylh Amendola for bringing me to the trail head and hiking part of the first day with me and lending me his trail maps. Special thanks to those that prayed for me. I came through it without injury and a better man, both physically and spiritually.",,View Entry,"Sep 24, Sun",0
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579440,"It has been nearly a month since I got off the trail and I'm really itching to get back. I'm planning on resuming my hike the last week of October for either 4 days or 7/8 days. I'm going to park my car midway with resupply items. In that manner I can opt to drive home after 4 days or continue the hike further north up to Rutland, VT. I completed my gear list and am continuing to exercise daily. I am really looking forward to the trip. 
The hardest part will be the first 2 days. On day one, I drive to the drop off point west of Manchester, VT, walk or hitch 5 miles west, take a bus from Manchester to Bennington, VT, hitch or schedule a trail shuttle to North Adams, MA. I am hoping to be on the trail by noon. I have nearly 14 miles to hike that afternoon to make it to the shelter, with over 2000 feet of elevation. I am hoping to get to the shelter by dusk. The second day I'm planning to hike 18 miles to get to the  shelter again. That will set me up for some leisurely hikes the rest of the week, averaging 12 to 14 miles per day. I hope you can join me for this journey on trail journals. Please pray for me and my family while I'm a way. Thank you and God speed.

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579796,"Day One. The adventure begins at 4:30 a.m. Starting with a hot shower and shave, followed by coffee. I got on the road by 5:15. I arrived at the parking lot in Southern Vermont by 7:45 AM. 
I got lucky and got a ride from the second car that drove by. He drove me 5 miles  to the Route 7 enyrance ramp. I hitch there for about 15 minutes before noticing that many more cars were entering the highway from another ramp a 100 yards west. Once I got to the other ramp I got a ride within 5 minutes. Today is my lucky day! This driver happened to be going to North Adams and gave me a ride the rest of the way. I was on the trail by 9:30. 

The first three miles of the hike was a gradual ascent to the ridge after that it leveled off and the scenery was just beautiful. It was a bit windy but very peaceful and the dry crisp autumn air was exquisite. I passed a few ponds and some power lines where the wind must have been blowing 40 miles an hour. Fortunately the power lines gave me some good views to the East and the West. 

After nearly 14 miles I arrived at the shelter. It was in disarray and needed some work. I was just happy to be there by 5:00. I was just happy to be there by 5 p.m. it gave me plenty of time to use the bathroom, fill up my water supply and get dinner ready before dark. 

At dusk  a hiker named Ezra came in from the north. He hiked 18 miles at day. I was really happy to have somebody to share the shelter with. He was one day away from completing the Appalachian Trail in Vermont. He was from Virginia and quit his job to do this. Was one day away from completing the Appalachian Trail in Vermont. 
There was there was no there was no bear box at the site, nor a nearby tree to hang food from. I then feviseda MacGyver type rigging on the upper bunk with some ropes and a bucket full of rocks that would trigger a loud noise if anything larger than a mouse trying to get through. That's where we left our food for the night.
The weather was Picture Perfect during the day temperatures were in the low-to-mid 60s. Despite despite the wind it felt 10 degrees cooler. Sweat dried almost as quickly as it formed. Regardless I changed my shirt every hour to ensure total dryness I passed about a half-dozen thru-hikers one of which was finishing the Appalachian Trail that day. I congratulated him on his success. Several other hikers had several hundred more miles to go and were all heading southbound.
On day two I am hiking thru the ghost town of Glastenbury over the mountain by the same name. In the last century four hikers disappeared there and were never found. All were wearing red when they ventures out. Some people say they got lost. Other people say they went up there to end their lives. I believe they encountered a myth a logical creature from England name the jabberwocky. In the 1970s there's a Monty Python film about the mystical creature. I believe it somehow flew to southern Vermont and is the reason for all of the disappearances. Needless to say I'm wearing a red backpack and I'm a little bit nervous about the next day's hike sweet dreams and goodnight.","North Adams, Massachusetts

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579802,"Day 2 of the adventure. I woke up at dawn at 6:30, made some instant coffee and breakfast. I packed up, said good by to Ezra and got on the trail by 7:40. It was a cold start with a temperature of 38 degrees. I warmed up on the first mile. 

After 4.2 miles I made it to rt. 9. The decent was really steep and did a job on my legs and joints. The trail then rose over a thousand feet over the next mile. Ouch! It then leveled off about 2 miles laterwhereI visited a shelter and had some lunch. 
I entered the Glastenbery wilderness around noon and began a faster pace. Around noon my right knee was feeling sore. At my 1:00 break the pain was worse so I put only elastic knee brace. That helped a lot!
I finally reached the summit of Glastenbery mountain at 4:00 PM. I climbed to the top of the fire tower there and took some pictures and videos there. You could see fifty to a hundred miles in all directions. 
I then hiked 3.5 miles to the shelter where I was staying. I arrived just before 6:00. I filled up my water supply from the nearby stream and said hi to a couple that were staying in tents adjacent to the shelter. Hence, I had the four person  shelter to myself. This one had several bear boxes to make life easier.
I brewed some herbal tea and some rice and tuna for dinner. I made a second cup of tea which I Frank while catching up on my trail journals. I then took 4 motrin to subdue my back and knee pain and hit the sack. It was a long and hard day for me. I felt an amazing sence of accompishment.","Cogden Shelter

LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579832,"Day 3, the adventure continues. I woke up at 7:20 this morning had my coffee ate breakfast packed up and said goodbye to the couple I was staying there and a lovely dog I wish I knew their names if they read this post please comment below so I can have it for my personal records.
 I got on the trail about 8:05. I continue to wear my elastic knee brace because my knee was still in pain from the strenuous table for today's plan is to hike plan a is to hike 15.5 miles to the next shelter that'll set me up for an a leisurely 10.5 mile hike and a 4 to the end plan B is to cowboy camp at the summit of Stratton Mountain not about the 10 point in about the 12.5 mile mark from there its 3 miles down hill to the shelter so I'm really going to try to press for the full distance tonight today plans see is too if the pain is too bad this is stopped at the next two major intersection and hitch hike back to my car that's still a 9.5 mile hike for today.
Within 2 hours I had made it to South Brook. It's the midway point between my shelter and the base of Stratton Mountain my knee pain is still as persistent as ever but the knee brace helps a lot it is very difficult to hike the trail in these conditions the one to 3 inches of leaves on the trail. 
Underneath the leaves Is mostly roots and smaller rocks leaving on the larger rocks and boulders visible see you never really know what you're going to step in until you step in it sometimes its mud and the sooner you can get out of it the dryer your feet will be. This is slowing me down a little but not much. It's more pain for my ankles but they are holding up just fine thank the good Lord.
 I then hiked past a large marsh and a beautiful beaver pond where the water was so still it looked like glass. Further on I stopped at Story Spring shelter for a breakfast bar and water break. There I met a young couple that we section hiking the area for a few days. The man was a physical therapist. He suggested I get some PT after my hike to aid in the recovery. I'm pretty sure I will take his advise.
Shortly after leaving that shelter the pain increased. I had to go really slow on the ups and downs and take it easy on the flats. At this point I'm not sure I will complete all 15.5 miles by dusk. 
I then came across another young couple who were section hiking the AT in VT. They had just 2.5 days left and will be finishing in the rain. The man had a knee brace on. I was glad because misery loves company!
Its now 1:00. I'm breaking every 25 minutes now for a 5 minute break. I passed black Brook a half mile ago which should put me about a mile from Stratton mountain. Its still slow going and I'm seriously wondering if I will be able to summit and get to the shelter by dark. The suspense is killing me. 
About a half hour later I came to the main road and decided to call it quits for the day. My knee was I a lot of pin and I could not foresee hiking up Stratton mountain in this condition. I quickly got a ride back to my car and decided to drive an hour north to the Inn at Love g Trail. 

At the Inn I took a not shower and had some beer and Guinness beef stew at the pub. I now feel well enough to resume my hike tomorrow morning. The Inn offers a free breakfast and I plan on eating here. 
St. Joseph, please pray for me and my family while I'm away. Goodnight.","Kidd Gore Shelter
