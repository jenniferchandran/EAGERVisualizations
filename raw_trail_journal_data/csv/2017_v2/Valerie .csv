Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551674,"So, first things first! I guess I have to have a few entries to be posted so I might as well introduce myself. I'm 25, I graduate community college (woo!) in the spring of 2017 and hope to be on the trail in June. When I first actually committed to thru hiking and kicked it out of my dream bucket, I planned I would start on Springer in March. I sat on that for awhile and decided a SOBO hike would probably suit me better and I can finish out my school (I guess that is important). So I'll be a SOBO. Say that five times as fast as you can.",,View Entry,"Nov 21, Mon",0
Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551675,"In just under 8 months hopefully I will have everything figured out and be climbing Mount Katahdin. The thought makes me just as excited as I am terrified about it. I'll be heading out solo, which is concerning at times, but from what I have read from here and doing research, I will not be alone on the trail. I did my first solo trip a couple weeks ago and I feel like it helped me gain some confidence. I had my dog for company so I was not completely alone. I did a two day trip, only about 23 miles. It was nice and quiet. I got to experiment with my gear, met a few friendly people on the trail and did not get murdered. So it was a success.",,View Entry,"Nov 21, Mon",0

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554670,"I finally made my reservation at Baxter State Park today. Hopefully its the best 30 bucks I've ever spent. Up until this point all my preparations haven't really made this trip seem like its really going to happen until now. Lately I've been stressing a lot over everything I need to do in the next four months, particularly leavin my pooch behind. I would love to have her along, she is so good on the trail and I would feel safer, but I think the logistics of having a dog for a LD hike would be too much. Plus I think shes afraid of heights and her farts are terrible.I've learned a lot from other journals on here and I hope that I do keep up with this while I'm on the trail. (I will try my damnedest!) I appreciate the really honest journals, not just the monotonous recaps of each day. I love reading and seeing a person develop throughout their hike. I loved reading about their highs and lows, the people they meet and all the different experiences. So I am going to try and be as honest with this journal as I can, which may prove difficult for me because I'm a pretty private person. Also, I have decided to take a train from Chicago to Maine and I am soooooooo stoked about that. What could be better than spending 48 hours on a train?!? That is not sarcasm. I am actually really excited about it.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Thu",0
Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567184,"I'm not sure what weighs more, my fat cat or my food bag. I went through my food only like 100 times and finally decided that I'm ""comfortable"" with the weight and it should hold me over for 10 days. Time is coming up fast and before I know it I'll be on a train to Maine. Kinda been freaking out a bit. Had a couple of slight anxiety episodes after my last shift at work. Quitting my job kinda topped it off and made me really think ""wait, what in the hell am I doing?"" Can I handle this? Have I made a horrible mistake? But that was last week and I'm feeling much more optimistic now. I've been going on hikes with my full pack almost everyday, set up my gps (thanks again Crusoe if your reading this!) and just trying to tie up loose ends before I leave. I have also been blown away by all the support I have received from everyone. I honestly wasn't really expecting it, but thank you to everyone for the encouragements and especially those that are going to help out my family and pets while I'm gone. It really means a lot to me, and I couldn't attempt to take a six month vacation without ya! I'm feeling excited and scared shitless, but I'm just gonna go for it. When I first started thinking about doing this, the fear of failure was already there.  I decided not to put so much pressure on myself. It will only make me miserable. I want to enjoy the hike, enjoy the experience and see what I can learn from it. If I don't make it all the way, that is totally OK. I'm going to give this thru hiking thing an honest try and see how far I can get.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Fri",0
Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568233,"At the AT lodge, getting ready to start the trail tomorrow. I am extremely anxious! I'm hoping for good weather tomorrow, but it looks like it may rain. I most likely won't update until I'm out of the hundred mile wilderness.","

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569677,"Climbing up Katahdin was the scariest thing I've ever done and it kicked my ass! The AT lodge dropped us off in the morning, it was a nice day but thunderstorms were expected in the afternoon. As soon as I stepped out out of the shuttle I was hit with the fresh pine smell. Charlie and I started around 8 am. Up and up we went. I wanted to beat the storm so I pushed a little too hard in the beginning. Charlie made it up to the first rebar and I told him he might wanna turn around now cuz of his shoulder. I could tell he was upset, I yelled out I love u and he said see you in 6 months! That kinda stung but i continued on. I was above tree line and by myself now. I looked around and I felt a giant rush of emotions run through me. I started crying a bit. Not from being scared just at how surreal it all felt. I cannot believe that I'm actually going through with this! The hiking turned into straight up rock scramble from that point on. I was terrified but just kept moving. After what seemed like forever I made it to the tabeland. The weather looked like it may be turning soon so I pushed on. I met Fox another hiker and we hiked together awhile. I got ahead and made that final assent to that damnef signed. It looked so small. I got up there at 2pm, took a few pics and then scuttled my butt down. It had taken me 6 hrs to climb. I saw fox and a few others, I said I'd wait for them in the table land and descend together cuz it was a sketchy climb down. I waited for 30 min. It was 3pm, Charlie was at camp waiting for me, if it took me another 6 hrs I wouldn't get back till 9! I looked around and the weather looked like it was changing. I made the decision to just get down as fast as I could. I RAN down that mountain. I have not known focus like that before. I was NOT going to get stuck above tree line in a thunder storm. As soon as I got to tree line the thunder started and then the rain. I passed so many people I was going so fast, afraid of the storm! I came out to an open ridge and saw a big lightning strike. That made me push even faster! I got back to camp and saw Charlie walking. I had never been so happy to see him. I felt guilty for goin on without him. I broke down. I ran down in 3.5 hrs. I was a wreck. I had ignored drinking and eating enough all day. Charlie had a fire n made dinner. I ate, drank and started to feel human again. What a day! The others that went up after me got stuck in the storm up there and two had to get rescued down. We kept goin to ranger station to check on them. Everyone got down safe eventually, but I knew I made the right call getting down as soon as I could. For future sobos, I highly recommend two nights in Baxter park to either wait out weather or zero the day after. I wish I had because the next day was rough.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570137,"Today I hiked out of Baxter State Park. I felt like crap all day. Extremely sore from the day before. Charlie's ride was late so I didn't start hiking until 9. Saying goodbye was harder than I thought it would be, and to be honest I cry hiked part of the day. Homesick already?! I was a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. The hike wasn't hard, but it felt like each step took twice the effort. I rock hopped the first stream and when I got to the second one I was too confident. The rocks were wet, I slipped and fell face first into a boulder in front of me rocking my chin hard. I didn't get knocked out so that was good! Shortly later, I was hiking lost in my thoughts about falling and I look up and there's a black bear 40 ft in front of me on the trail! It took one look at me and ran off faster than I had time to think. I nearly pissed my pants. It's pretty rare to see bears up here, so I considered myself lucky that I fell and got to see one. I stopped at Abol bridge camp, right before the 100 mile wilderness. I decided to listen to my body and cut the day short 3 miles. A guy named Sean from Massachusetts was camping next to me and said a moose came right through my tent spot the day before. ""Should I not camp here?"" I asked. ""Nah, he won't bother ya"". So I camped next to a beautiful river. Chin all scrapped up, sore to the bone, cried half the day, but I saw a bear on day two!","

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570138,"I awoke in my tent at dawn to ""psssst, psssst"" It was Sean who camped next to me. ""Val, there's a young bull moose bedding down in the trees"". I shot up and out of my tent. A moose! I followed him a little ways into the trees and there he was, laying down I could see his antlers. I watched awhile then packed up and ate. On my way out the moose was walking around the camp, indifferent to us watching him. I passed two young guys playing frisbe outside of the Able store. I lightly yelled ""hey, theres a moose down there"". They stopped what they were doing and went to go look. What an awesome start to the day. This hike also should of been easy, but I was still so sore that I took my time. The moisture from my sweat made my feet peel, so that's kinda sucks. Camped at Rainbow lake campsites. It's a beautiful lake/pond with a piped spring. Awesome water source. Going to take my time as I try and get through the 100 mile wilderness. Thank you to Sean if you ever read this, that moose made my day!","Abol Bridge Campground

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570139,"Getting up is the hardest part. Everything hurts! Today I climbed my second mountain and saw my second moose! A female wading in a lake. Slept in a lean to for the first time tonight, it called for rain tomorrow morning. Met more Sobos and some section hikers from Quebec who made a fire! Less mosquitos! Haven't seen those black flies, but the mosquitos are relentless so far. Going to try and get to Whitehouse landing tomorrow. It's a hostel that picks u up by boat. Bad weather in the forecast.","Rainbow Lake campsite

Valerie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570141,"What a crazy day. Before I begin, I need to mention I lost my pants on the first day. Don't ask me how, but it happened. The day started off good, but the rain kept coming down. It was in the 40s and I was wet. I eventually put my rain pants on, but I was still cold. There were so many blown down trees on the trail that I kept getting lost and confused on where the trail went. Backtracking and not moving much I began to get very cold. Perfect hypothermia weather! I rock hopped a stream and saw the card for the Whitehouse landing. Somehow I had signal and they said to go to the dock. Long story short, I got mixed up but eventually found it. I met the owner and climbed into the boat shivering and tired. At this point the rain was really coming down. He seemed annoyed that I took too long to find the dock and he put the boat in high gear. It was a sketchy boat ride, maneuvering through boulders and tredding choppy water in a downpour. I thought to myself, I sure hope I don't die right now! In my rain suit I'd sink like a rock. He docked the boat and I tried to keep up as he hurried up the hill. I entered the bunkhouse and was hit with a wall of warmth. There was a wood burning stove and I realized how cold I was. Three other hikers KC, jimmy and elias were there. I am forever grateful for the refuge I found there. Thank you Whitehouse landing! You saved my sorry ass from a cold and wet night!","Wadleigh Stream lean-to
