Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545702,"...or, so it comes down to this.Like quite a few people, I am coming to understand, I have dreamed of hiking the AT for many years. In fact, I first heard about the trail as a kid back in the late 70's while visiting an aunt and uncle at their summer cabin near Robbinsville, NC. Some cousins joined us after having hiked a portion of the Trail and I recall being quite envious as their stories were shared. Of course, growing up and finally getting to the point I was able to choose my own path, life (as it tends) began getting in the way.Skipping the movie reviews of 'Into The Wild' and 'Wild' (itself), I'll fast-forward to coming across Bill Bryson's book, 'A Walk In The Woods'. Refocusing my AT dream, I came to the conclusion that if it was going to be done, it was up to ME to make it happen. Pretty much like Bryson, I made up my mind and announced to the family, I NEED to make this happen.So, as I am making preparations, and reading as much as I can get my hands on, I have been inspired by several other authors. Paul Stutzman, in particular, has been instrumental in helping me recognize what I need to do to take this adventure out of my dreams and into reality. I do not know if I will ever get the opportunity to speak with him, but if so, I know exactly what I will say!Mission accomplished Apostle, I have heard.",,Long Time Coming,"Aug 14, Sun",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545780,"So, like Bryson, I came to a point in my life that I knew this is what I had to do. Unfortunately, my lifestyle is more akin to Katz than to Bryson. This is a cause for concern to me and I know more prolific hikers will probably be shaking their collective heads at my desire to hit the trail. Few will think that I actually have a shot at making the mighty Katahdin. However, my desire to complete the thru-hike is fueled by decades of suppressing this dream - amongst many trials (figurative trails) that have strengthened my resolve and forged a constitution much stronger than sometimes I probably would have prefered.At some point, I am sure I will divulge my story. I have a feeling that it will come a lot easier with the cathartic effects of the trail experience but we shall see. For now, I am content to align my ducks and focus on preparing for this awesome adventure!",,The Dream is Alive!,"Aug 15, Mon",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545864,"Not a whole lot to say today. Just relaxing before I have to go into work.Work. I have not been satisfied with my job (and employment situation in general) for over four years now. Because of the amount of time I have with my company, I am eligible for early retirement. While I know that my pension and current 401(k) will not allow a work free retirement, I have decided that it is time for me to leave my current career. It just so happens that my 50th birthday is in March of next year. Shortly after, on April 1st, will be my 30 year anniversary with the company. It just seems clear to me that date should also be my retirement date. I should be on the Trail within days of that date.I initially chose Monday, April 10th, but I am starting to rethink this date as I scan the list of other hikers planning for next year. The vast majority seem to be aiming for March starts. I know that it will take some time for me to get my trail legs and I do not want to be in the situation where I am trying to race trail closure heading north. I can afford to be flexible as I have plenty of vacation that can be used to manipulate my work termination date.But, I also would prefer not to have to deal with a lot of snow and nasty weather while trying to find said trail legs. I will probably end up splitting the difference and move my start date to the very end of March (or first couple of days in April).",,Pondering My Exit Strategy,"Aug 16, Tue",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549728,"It’s been a while since I’ve had anything to update but now that a room is secured at the Amicalola Lodge, my start date is firm: 04APR.I was looking to move up a couple weeks from my original date of 10APR (mainly based on the preponderance of mid-March start dates here) but couldn’t secure a room (understandably) at the Lodge during that timeframe.So, Tuesday, April 4th it is, and I am quite stoked!",,Updated Start Date,"Sep 27, Tue",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551766,"Well, I feel like things are progressing well with my preparation. I now have in hand my tent, boots, and pack.
Just this evening I registered my start at Amicalola with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and I registered for an AT preparation course with REI. I will be attending one of the sessions in Charlotte next month. That should make for a nice little overnight excursion.
Anticipation is high and I know these next few months are going to fly by. Looking forward to this adventure and I cannot wait to get out on the Trail!",,Thru Hike Registration,"Nov 23, Wed",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556199,"I've been quiet for the last few months but certainly not due to lack of interest! I have been busy wrapping up the last of my gear acquisition and testing, preparing to leave my job and taking care of some off-trail issues.
I am still set to hit the trail on 04APR and sometimes have difficulty suppressing my excitement. With one day of work left (after tonight) I have now publicly announced my AT plans. The support and encouragement have been tremendous.
Let’s get steppin’!",,Just About Set To Go,"Mar 12, Sun",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558226,"Unexpected vehicle repairs have posed a serious challenge to final preparations. I will be sticking to my plan of stepping off on the Appalachian Trail on Tuesday, 04APR, but that means we (my wife and I) leave for Georgia in two days!
So far, I only have my first mail drop ready to send and I will do that this morning. I will also finish up my gear treatment (pest control and waterproofing). Then off to shop for my 8 remaining mail drops plus my meals for the first few days. Hopefully, I can get that all squared away today so that I can spend all of tomorrow loading the pack. We are heading to the airport Sunday morning.
Apart from worrying about my preparedness, I had a rather alarming bout of anxiety a few days ago. It may just be pre-hike jitters (is that a thing?) but I don't know. What I do know is that after communicating to my wife that I probably should just postpone, she got me back on track with a most supportive lecture - reminding me how much time and effort I've spent planning this endeavor. I've worked too hard to get everything ready to go. I won't cave to the pressures of things that can be capably handled in my absence. I will miss my family, for sure, but they are all adults now and have been managing pretty much without me for the last five years.
What I hope to achieve on this adventure could aptly be referred to as a reboot. I want to use this time to make an adjustment of attitude toward so many aspects of my life - a return of positivity that has been lost somewhere along the way. I truly feel (even though I know some think this whole thing irresponsible) that it would be irresponsible for me NOT to do this. I am certain that this will be a positive experience for me and will, in turn, be of benefit to my family.
Stay tuned for updates from the Trail!",,Final Preparations,"Mar 31, Fri",0
Strabo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558551,"After less than three hours sleep, I woke to get ready and head to the airport. Not only was I running low on sleep, anxiety was just about making me sick. We got to the airport, though, with time to pamper ourselves a bit with a light breakfast and coffee at the United Club. That went a long way to settle my stomach and the flight went off without a hitch.
Arriving in Atlanta, we did have an issue with the car rental company taking much longer than anticipated. We were on the road after an hour in line and finally headed to the mountains.
North Georgia was worth the wait and I was all smiles as we entered Amicalola State Park. We got checked into our room at the Lodge and were treated to our first scenic view out of the room window. As we hadn't really made plans for the travel day, we decided to refresh our memory of the stairs along the Falls. For anyone that isn't familiar with Amicalola Falls, they are the largest in the state of Georgia and are flanked by a set of stairs with 605 steps. The Lodge sits at the top of the falls and we took the steps down to the base simply to turn around and go back up. The thought was that we would be back up to watch the sunset. While we made it back in time, clouds had rolled in making dusk a bit anti-climatic.
At this point we were getting hungry and decide to see what was in the area. We hit upon a restaurant in Dahlonega that was very enjoyable (good food, good beer selection and live music). Unfortunately, returning to Amicalola, I missed a turn and we almost didn't make it back in the park before the gates were locked for the evening.
So, to bed now with a full day to play tomorrow before heading off on the Approach Trail to Springer Mountain Tuesday morning.",,Travel to Amicalola Falls Lodge,"Apr 02, Sun",0
