Sean Ross,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560733,"I have never kept a blog or even a diary before, however I felt that it would be worthwhile to allow me to look back on in future and as a platform to enable my friends and family to follow my hike.I leave for the trail in three days therefore the last week has been spent doing the mundane tasks necessary before beginning any long trip - sorting out insurance, banking, removing all body hair...I've been finished work and uni around 3 weeks so have managed to do some decent training. I've climbed 5 Munros and hiked roughly 60 miles over 2 days through some tough conditions so I am feeling quite comfortable with my body and gear. I have managed to reduce the base weight of my pack to under 15 lbs which I am pretty pleased with as I haven't cut out any essentials.The best news of the past few weeks is that my dad will be flying with me to Georgia and will be able to drive me to Springer. By sheer coincidence he has business meetings in Atlanta the same week so we have arranged flights together. The benefits of this are two-fold: 1. I don't have to pay hundreds of dollars to get to Springer. 2. We have a 6 hour lay-over in Heathrow and as my dad is a frequent flyer we have access to all the free food and bevy we want!Surprisingly, nerves have yet to hit in as I'm just itching to get going. My next update will be from the trail, if we are allowed on our flight ofcourse!",,Preparation,"Apr 19, Wed",0
Sean Ross,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561516,"Managed 17 miles from springer to Gooch Gap shelter. It was tough and only arrived just before sunset. The rain for the first 5 miles or so was torrential and barely let up. Some steep climbs that took a bit out of me but did well considering 17 miles was done in around 5.5 hours. Body feels okay, slight pain in right metatarsal but that's probably just swelling. Had 2 Nutella tortillas for dinner, probs need more food but don't feel like eating more. Sleeping in tent which pitched perfectly. Got a 22 mile day tomorrow so up nice and early so I'm not chasing the sun to finish like today.","Springer Mountain

Sean Ross,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561519,"I woke up around 6 o'clock and could get back to sleep as it was pretty cold and the ground not too comfortable. However the Inside of the tent was dry and I managed 8 hours sleep so I can't complain. I had a tough day ahead so emerged from my tent around 7 and was on the road for 8. I had originally planned to do 22 miles today but this quickly became an unrealistic target given the tough climbs - I never knew Georgia was considered one of the toughest states but I can definitely see why, back home I can maintain 3.5mph pace when hiking, today my pace was barely above 2mph. Instead I stopped into Mountain Crossings at Neels gap for the night as it is cheap, sells some items that I need such as a bear bag and most importantly has Â£5 pizzas! This hostel is famous for having a tree with with hundreds of shoes hanging from its branches thrown by hikers leaving the trail after 30 miles. I met a few nice people today, one guy known as ""Red squirrel"" who has hiked the PCT gave me a few useful tips about caring for my feet. tomirrow I'm headed for Blue Mountain shelter which should be good as I've heard the weather is to improve!","Gooch Gap Shelter
