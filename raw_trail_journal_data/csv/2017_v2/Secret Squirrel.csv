He will be wearing his dog costume so as not to upset the locals.It's been an interesting day and interesting things always make me sleepy so I will be going to bed early tonight. It's supposed to start raining around midnight so it should be a good test night.I've spent many nights in tents but it's been a long since I was in one this small. It's at this point that a lot of bloggers offer words of wisdom. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that I have none.,,Top of the mountain,"Oct 13, Tue",0
Secret Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515869,It was an interesting trip to the top if the mountain. My dragon and I hiked up in the dark around 2200 hours. The dog costume worked too well and a few neighborhood dogs insisted upon tagging along. I didn't really mind until we crawled into the tent for the night and they began to growl and bark while I was trying to watch a movie on the Kindle. I will need to take earphones on the next trip. Luckily the rain came in early in the form of a very impressive thunderstorm with an abundance of water which sent the doggies retreating for home.The tent worked well and the sleeping bag was comfortable in 40-50 degree weather. I have another tent to test as the temps begin to drop in this area. I would like a little more padding to sleep on these rocks. The Dragon was comfortable in his dog suit.The Kindle worked great and outperformed the IPad in everything I tried to do. I didn't really expect to have a connection but the Kindle hooked up quickly and the battery provided enough power to watch two movies.I didn't sleep much but I can't blame the equipment for that. The following morning I found that I had no desire to eat nor even have coffee. I think I shall have alter my game plan so that I will do a bit of walking prior to breakfast.I think I will hike up the Sprnger approach trail for the next equipment test. It will be a week or so before I can do that. The Dragon will have to remain on this mountain.,,Bottom of the mountain.,"Oct 15, Thu",0
Secret Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554696,I’ll be leaving tomorrow morning to drive to Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia. I am starting early in the hiking season to avoid the bubbles of bubbleheads that will soon flood the trail. I will leave the dragon behind; he’s far too aggressive to allow to interact with the general populace.I have had a lot of trouble arriving at my final gear list and will be posting it soon.,"
