Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556824,"The first few days have been very tough. Snow, cold, and wind. The temps were in the teens without accounting for the horrid wind that has been blowing. It has been so frustrating that I only took a few pics the first couple of days. I've just been aiming my head toward the ground and trying to head north. I haven't stopped to look at views. I've only been trying to get from point A to point B which is contrary to what you should be doing. But it's been too brutal to enjoy.Hopefully, the weather is going to turn for the better so I can start to stop for lunch and enjoy the views. I think I've been getting close to dehydrating or not eating enough. But like I said, it's been too bad to stop and smell the frozen roses. Anyway, that's it for now. I hope cell service gets better so I can keep in touch with the family.","

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557202,"Started at Dicks Creek Gap 69.3 at 8:20. Dropped off by Sally. Stayed at holiday inn in Hiawassee. Stealth camping at Water Oak Gap 83. Hiked 13.7 miles today. I don't know what made me feel better; the rest, better weather, or food change. The hike was not bad even with a few steep climbs. The big thing for the day was getting into North Carolina. Also passed the twisted tree at Bly Gap. Ariel and I had lunch there last year. So I had lunch there again in celebration of being there again. Stopped hiking around 4:20 with still good temps. The sun was out all day and the wind was minimal. What a difference that makes in the hike and attitude. Supposed to cool off tonight, but I don't think like last week. I hope not to see those temps again..","Dicks Creek Gap

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557203,"Today was a good day. Started at Water Oak Gap 83 after a pretty good stealth camping. Had to get out and pee four times. I have a pee bottle to use to keep from getting out of tent, but I can't get into any position to use it without cramping some part of my body. So I will continue to drink from my pee bottle until I can actually pee in it.
Crested over Standing Indian Mountain today at over 5,400 feet in elevation. Thin air and not in hiking shape don't mix well. But it wasn't too bad. Had good views and stayed high for a few miles. High in elevation, that is.
Also there was a memorial to a gentleman that should have been my age at the top of the mountain. I'm not sure if he passed away up there or if it was his favorite place to hike. I took a pic to see if I can read it better later.
Ended at Betty Creek Gap 97.3. There are some scattered camp sites there. I'm actually near a dirt road. Three cars have passed by in the last hour. I hope they don't come get me in the middle of the night. 
Finished the day with 14.3 miles","Water Oak Gap

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557206,"Today was a tester. In the beginning of the day we topped Albert Mountain which I'd the 100 mile mark. It was a climb to the to, not a hike.Later was a difficult hike over the mountain that Ariel and I stealth camped in a big storm last year. A lot of the trail had been reworked and relocated possibly due to the fires from last year. The climb took ask the energy I had left in me. So when I finally came to a downhill to Winding Stair Gap I decided to take a shuttle into Franklin.","Betty Creek Gap

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557484,"Left out of Winding Stair Gap 109.5 around 10:30 am after a zero day in Franklin. Got a late start because the first shuttle was packed full and we had to wait for another shuttle.Went over Siler Bald which had nice views. Also went to the Wayah Bald Tower. The fires had hit there too. The top of the tower was burned and the woods around area had been burned as well.Even though a lot of areas have been burned,Â  The area still looks very nice.Ariel and Hayley will know my next thing, I'm camping with Teardrop and a couple of other guys. He has been youtubing about hiking the AT for about three years.We are at Burningtown Gap 124.1 which is about a mile from a shelter.That gave me a 14.6 mile day.","Franklin-Winding Stair Gap

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557488,"Last night around 10:50 I was awakened by a high powered rifle shot. About 100 yards from the camp was a dead end gravel road. Apparently it's a good place to go spotlighting and shoot at anything that moves. Then the spotlight hit my tent, but no shot. Whew! They left after they saw my tent.So I got up and was off on my way to the NOC. I will eventually stop talking about the fire damage, but it was bad again today. I ran into a ridge runner later in the day and she explained all the work that they had been doing to the trails post fires. I know the area needs rain, but there may be an erosion problem if they get a lot. 
The Jump-off was the big spot of the day. Great views from there and several other spots along the drop into the NOC.Overall had a good day.","Burnigtown Gap

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557591,"Today was a good day. Views were limited early in the day since I was in the clouds. But it got better as the day progressed. Steep climb up and a big drop down. Temperatures were real good for hiking. Water was limited on the trail, but I had plenty. Saw my first snake of the season (see pics). It was a three or four foot black snake out warming up along the trail.Looks like it may rain tomorrow and the next. Going to shoot for Fontana Dam tomorrow and then zero before starting the Smokeys.","NOC

Rodney Cooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557816,"Started the day at Stecoah Gap 150.4 at around 7:15. Did slack packing today. Stayed at Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel (828-735-0768) the last couple of days. It's a very good place and deal. You have your own bedroom and you can do your laundry at no extra charge. Lonnie is the owner and you can't ask for a nicer or more helpful person. I recommend anyone from the NOC of Fontana dam to check this place out.I had to climb Jacobs Ladder pretty early in the hike. It was tough but the views were great looking down as the sun was rising. I took a lunch break at cable gap shelter as it started to sprinkle. After lunch there was a good climb up to a ridge that had good views of the lake for a long time. On the descent the dam was in view for two hours before coming to the road that goes to it. I continued to walk to the Fontana Hilton which claims to be the nicest shelter on the AT. It may be since it has restrooms, showers, and charging areas. Plus it sits just above the lake.I continued to the visitor center 166 to complete my day. I sat on a picnic table for a while just relaxing and enjoying the views. Then I hopped in the car and drove for dinner and back to the hostel.Pretty good 15.6 mile day.Tomorrow I start my trek through the Smoky Mountains. I have enough food for six days. The bag is heavy. I don't plan on going into Gatlinburg, but we'll see what I do when I get to Newfound Gap.That's all for now. Don't know what service I will have the next few days, so don't worry if you don't hear from me for a while.","Stecoah Gap
