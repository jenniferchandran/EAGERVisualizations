GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557536,"So, I just opened this account on Trail Journals. I plan to head north from Harpers Ferry, WV next week and see how far I get. I've been ""training"" since January, when I switched from a ""runners"" training program of about 70 miles a month to a hiker's program in which I've been walking with an incrementally heavier training backpack (now 35 lbs) for varied but generally incrementally longer distances about every other day. My longest so far has been about 18 miles which happened to be the day of a local snow storm, so it was a good check-ride for my rain and cold weather gear. Additionally, it was a mixture of ground conditions, from uneven dirt covered with snow and ice to damp pavement. I've also been doing some indoor inclined-treadmill workouts and a variety of other exercises recommended by other hikers.I've got about 95% of my gear, but I just got a new backpack and tarp yesterday, so over the next couple days I'll be finalizing the initial configuration of both and practicing a setup/tear-down routine. I also intend to get in a couple more long-hike days and over-nighters before starting out on the trail.",,None,"Mar 25, Sat",0
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557631,"I worked with the new backpack yesterday. Spent several hours working out a good loadplan (which I know I will change). Result: first-cut base pack-weight is 23.6 lb, and I'm pretty happy with that as a start point for tuning, because I have several items I know I can cut to lighter weights. Like... I am NOT going to bring all 100 feet of 550 cord! And I am sure I can be more efficient than 36 oz of ""medicine!"" Haha - most of that's gotta' be the containers! (hey, so I'm an old guy with a bunch of chronic aches and ailments -- but that's actually one of the reasons I'm doing this: the training and execution is great physical therapy).So, from today through start date is all shake-down. Today's focus is camp setup/tear-down with a light tarp and optimization of the equipment set that entails.",,LTA (local training area),"Mar 26, Sun",0
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558322,"Today it begins. I managed to cut some weight and now have a 21 lbs 9 oz base pack weight. I spent the last couple days optimizing the load and loadplan -- and working on recipes for and preparing quantities of trail food. Thanks to Teresa for help with that and the resupply ops yet to come.Adding a basic sustainment load of three days of food (almost 4 1/2 lbs) and a couple liters of water (4 lbs more) will bring that to almost 30 lbs, which is more than I want to carry. So, I expect to cut the base weight a bit more as it warms up, and as I get more confidence in what I can do without. I may also intentionally go a bit light on food during this first leg of the journey, since I've managed to store up a little extra potential energy over the last couple weeks! (haha)The final shake-out drill with my new tarp went well the other night -- good test with wind and rain. I think I have workable configurations and rigging modifications needed to optimize its performance in various weather conditions.I've got so much to learn, and so much yet to experience; I'm anxious to get on with that!So if this morning goes well, I should be out on the trail a few hours from now.",,Harpers Ferry,"Apr 01, Sat",0
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558411,"Started at Harpers after lunch (instead of breakfast). Beginning about 2 pm, Teresa and Joey walked with me for the first three miles or so -- across and along the Potomac. I found trail magic on day one! (Big thanks to Andy Bowes, trail name Opie!) at about mile 10 for the day. I managed to use the rest room at the Gaft State Park, kept walking to vicinity of Crampton, but set up a ""stealth"" camp in the woods rather than hang with folks at the shelter. I do look forward to meeting people, but for now I want to go solo a little and scrub off some of the conspicuous newness first.","Harpers Ferry

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558515,"Great night. Had Super Oatmeal (oatmeal, quinoa flakes, dates, cinnamon, nuts, whole milk powder) for breakfast. Hiked all day. Mega gorp (enhanced ""good old raisins and peanuts"") for snacks and lunch. Beautiful sunny day. Cool side trails to the Washington Monument and Annapolis Rocks. 20 miles was a *lot* for day 2, but I'm back on the original schedule. Beef jerky, potato flakes and veggies re-hydrated with some bouillon for dinner. Tea. Tired!","Crampton
",Ensign Cowall Shelter,"Apr 02, Sun",20.70
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558666,"I am amazed at the restorative power of sleep. I felt very good today. There were three other guys at the shelter I stayed in last night. Jim and Travis, a policeman and a teacher from southern Indiana, doing a 40 mile section southbound; and Mike, a retired Army officer about 10 years older than I am, who is also a nobo (northbound) early flip flopper. Mike and I hiked together today and exchanged lots of stories. We kept an easy pace and made it past the Mason Dixon line and the PA border before 4:30 pm. Mike was going to try to get a hotel room in Waynesboro, PA. I continued on to Deer Lick. Mike pulled in about 30 min later, having decided against the hotel. There are two shelters here, and nobody else, so we each have one to ourselves.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558777,"Great day today. Rainy in the morning but actually pleasant. Took a picture on a side trail at Chimney Rocks. Later, I managed to recharge my phone to 70% at Caledonia State Park. Met up with nobo hiker Judi ""Flicker"" (RPI class of 84). We chatted and did about 8 miles together. Also linked up with lasher (long a__ section hiker) John ""No Name"" who was also hiking to Quarry Gap today. We made good time and arrived at Quarry Gap about 2:30 pm. Flicker's husband Willie ""Gandalf"" was pre-positioned with some of her stuff and his. He had hiked in south a couple miles to get here. I got to clean up a bit with a *cold* splash-bath downstream from our water source. Had soupy potatoes and veggies with some tomato powder for dinner. Delicious.","Deer Lick Shelters
",Quarry Gap,"Apr 04, Tue",15.50
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558941,"Another day of beautiful weather. I decided the 24 miles on my schedule for today was too much, so I stopped in Pine Grove with the same folks who were at Quarry Gap with me yesterday. We did 17. Along the way we passed the marker for the midpoint of the AT (Half way between Springer Mountain, GA and Katahdin, ME). We are all staying at the hostel here - $33 for pizza, bed, breakfast, and a load of laundry. This is to avoid bad weather due in tonight - tornado/thunderstorm warnings. I will check in the morning, and likely hike the remaining distance to Boiling Springs (in the rain). John and Willie took some pictures today and said they will send them to me, so I will post them when I get them.","Quarry Gap
",Pine Grove Furnace State Park,"Apr 05, Wed",17
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559030,"Today was a lot of fun. The weather, the distance and the rock mazes each required the exercise of good judgement. The weather (rained all day) required me to manage several changes to clothing and equipment in order to stay warm. The distance (over 20 miles if I count a couple places I got off the trail by accident!) tested but did not overtax my endurance. And ""rock maze"" means the rocks you have to scramble over are bigger than you, and in at least one place, you had a choice between climbing over one or crawling under the one next to it. I had to say goodbye to the great people I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet and hike with over the last couple days. I learned a lot from Flicker, Gandalf, and No Name. I hope, somehow, we'll see each other somewhere up the trail.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park
",Boiling Springs,"Apr 06, Thu",20
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559078,"I'm enjoying not having to walk today. Teresa joined me Thursday evening and we had dinner at The Boiling Springs Tavern. It's a great 19th century tavern with an owner, manager and wait staff that treat you like you're a regular. We stayed at the visiting officer's quarters on Carlisle Barracks. Friday morning we went re-supply shopping at the commissary on the Army base. Friday afternoon we walked around the little lake in Boiling Springs and saw the Iron Works, the path of the AT through town, the home where the underground railroad operated out of in mid 19th century and one of the actual boiling springs. There were ducks, geese, and swans on the lake, as well as fly fishermen around it. Friday evening we made up meals for my next several days of hiking, and we packed a box with similar foods, which Teresa will mail ahead for me.","Boiling Springs

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559307,"This morning, Teresa drove me from Carlisle back to Boiling Springs and I hiked north (back through Carlisle where I had just come from haha) to Darlington shelter. It was a beautiful, sunny day. Most of the trail today was flat, and it passed through a number of farms. I saw several people walking on the trail for short distances, including two men with dogs and a Spanish teacher who goes by the trail name Perigrina. Teresa, in the process of setting out trail magic for Flicker, No Name, and Gandalf, actually met them. I later ran into Willie (Gandalf) on the trail as he was hiking south to link up with Flicker at Scott's Farm. I got to Darlington shelter just before 3:30 pm, and No Name arrived shortly after that. As we were preparing to eat an early dinner and settle in before the temperature dropped for the day, he said my trail name should be ""GI Joe."" I signed the shelter logbook that way.","Carlisle Barracks Pennsylvania

A jogging hiker reminded me of the messenger running across the fields of Hyrule.John and I met Willie and Judi at the hiker-legendary Doyle, where I had a great ""buffalo burger."" After lunch we put in a couple more miles and then got rooms in the Red Carpet Inn.","Darlington Shelter
",Duncannon,"Apr 09, Sun",12.20
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559572,"This morning the climate at Duncannon started out cool as we climbed up the shaded side of a massive ridge line to a height of about 1000 feet above the valley floor. From there we walked 14 miles to a campsite on top of the ridge near its distant northeast end. The weather today was beautiful, but the constant sun and warmer temperatures up into the eighties made it a little bit more challenging. The top of the ridge line is also very rocky, which takes a toll on feet. Mine are glad to be getting a break right now! The first order of business after arriving at camp was to take off my boots and put on my crocs. Then I put up the tarp to provide shelter in case the weather turns and there is some precipitation tonight. However, I don't think I'm going to need it for anything other than protection against wind, as it looks like it's going to be a good night.","Duncannon

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559839,"It was an easy 13 mile hike on a beautiful day, a welcome relief after yesterday's rocky trail. I'm fortunate to still be hiking with Gandolf, Flicker and No Name again and really enjoying their company! We broke camp early, right after I fueled up on some super oatmeal, and we were on the trail by 7 am. We pulled into today's stop at Rausch Gap shelter at about 2 pm. After getting out of boots and into Crocs, I made my way down to a nearby stream and was able to access the water and wash sweaty clothes and self. It was very cold, but refreshing. No Name and I will need to get to a store in the next couple of days to resupply. Looks like we might get this done tomorrow. Gandolf (he and Flicker are doing their own version of a slack pack) says he can give us a ride. Goal is to make it to 501 Shelter tomorrow. This represents the addition of a day or 2 to my original ""schedule"" for when I should make it to Port Clinton, where I should be able to get the additional supplies Teresa mailed there.Pictures uploaded: ""The General,"" a side hike to a nearby hill, ""Bear Bag"" showing the lengths we go hoisting food bags to keep bears from being interested in our campsite, and a ""Nearby Stream""","Campsite at Mile Marker 1163
",Rausch Gap Shelter,"Apr 11, Tue",12.90
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559909,"After a very pleasant night at the Rausch Gap shelter, I continued hiking with No Name and Flicker. We went about six miles and then Gandalf gave us a ride to resupply. Of course we stopped at a place called Frogs Hollow Bar and Grill and had half pound burgers first! We didn't want to go food shopping hungry haha. We ended up picking up supplies at a Dollar General and at Walmart. Then Willie drove us back to the trail and we hiked another seven miles or so to the William Penn shelter. The others stopped there and I said goodbye to them again, and I pressed on another 4 miles to the 501 Shelter. This is an interesting place with a full-time caretaker. It is an enclosed shelter almost like a hostel, with a large Skylight through which I can see the stars. When I arrived I met two ladies who have been hiking together. They go by Sergeant Sunrise and Jack Rabbit. I think they said their actual names are Sharon and Nancy. They have been section hiking together for years and they are camping nearby. They're nice people, about my age. One is a cancer survivor and the other has done a marathon in each of the 50 states.","Rausch Gap Shelter
",501 Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",17.50
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559982,"It was pretty chilly when I started out from the 501 Shelter. I had hiked about four miles when I ran across Sergeant Sunrise and Jack Rabbit going the other way. They had hired a shuttle and did a day - hike from the north back to the 501 Shelter. At about the ninth mile, I saw Gandalf and his truck. I stopped and chatted a little and ate my lunch. Then I continued on for another 6 miles to the Eagles Nest shelter. The post office in Port Clinton opens at 12:30, and I need to stop there to retrieve the supplies Teresa sent. So it didn't make sense to try to get any closer today, when I'd just have to burn time tomorrow morning. 
When I arrived at the Eagles Nest, I met ""Versper"" from Princeton, NJ, who had been on the trail 10 days, hiking south from NJ to NC. We each shared info on the parts of the trail we had been on recently. Then Gandalf arrived and later Flicker and No Name, who had hiked 19 miles to get there. Later another three hikers arrived - they go by ""the April fools,"" but I didn't really get to know any of them yet. 
John said he saw bear tracks today. I thought it was a big dog. Anyway, we hung up a pretty heavy set of bear bags tonight. 
I had Wisconsin beef sausages in mashed potatoes and beef broth for dinner. Everyone is now quietly in bed at 8:30 pm.
Tomorrow, I'll try to get mail from Port Clinton and maybe make it to the next shelter north.","501 Shelter
",Eagles Nest,"Apr 13, Thu",15.10
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560084,"Today was another great day on the trail. I hiked my 200th mile! I continue on with Flicker, Gandolf and No Name. We left the Eagles Nest shelter in the morning and hiked about nine miles to the town of Port Clinton, PA where I stopped at the post office and picked up supplies that Teresa mailed to me. Willie also gave us a ride to the Cabela's Outfitter store where John got a new pair of shoes. After, we went to lunch and had burgers. So at this rate it does not look like I'm in any danger of not getting enough calories! After that mission we got back on the trail in Port Clinton and hiked another six miles to the Windsor Furnace shelter. Here we met back up with ""the April fools"" who are tenting near the shelter. I got to chat with and get to know them a little better. John and Gail are a retired Coast Guard couple and Linda is a professor at the University of Montana. I'm presently sitting in the woods just up the hill behind the shelter and it's dark already now, so I have to use my headlamp with red light to find my way back to the shelter. Goodnight!","Eagles Nest
",Windsor Furnace Shelter,"Apr 14, Fri",14.70
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560206,"Today was overcast and cool, but it was a good day for hiking. I hiked with Flicker all day. We did about nine miles in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Eckville shelter. On the way to that location we passed a spot called Dan's Pulpit and another called The Pinnacle. I'm not sure if we weren't completely paying attention, but I saw nothing of note at the location on the map called Pinnacle other than a large rock pile. It was sort of a massive cairn, over 10 feet tall. Each of us added a rock in contribution to the large pile. After lunch we hiked another 7.5 miles and went through several boulder fields.","Windsor Furnace Shelter
",Allentown Hiking Club Shelter,"Apr 15, Sat",16.50
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560365,"So, today I crossed over the 218.7 mile mark, somewhere (10% of the entire AT). In the morning, the trail started off easy for a few miles, then there was the boulder field known as the ""knife's edge"" which was actually a little dangerous, as well as several other boulder fields and sections we refer to as ""ankle busters."" Then, after about 12 miles (still hiking with Flicker and No Name), we had a short lunch break and decided to put in a few more miles and get to Palmerton, PA before taking a night off at a B&B. This was mainly because we'd all become quite ""ripe"" (if you know what I mean), and we all needed a shower and to clean our clothing. First however, we stopped at a place called ""The Shack"" for beer and burgers, which tasted great!! (Kudos for The Shack!)
The ""Blue Mountain Summit B&B"" is probably not unique in this world. (Only meters off the trail, quaint, rustic), but the owner/ manager/ bartender Kenny 
is *certainly* unique! He is a caring person, but he is clearly tired after 21 years of running this place - of both strange people (who in their right mind would want to try to thru hike the AT?), and he apparently has no ""filter."" He is not like other people. Or so says his girlfriend, who has been a teacher for 29 years. She's clearly passionate about her work, which goes far beyond the ""8th Grade English Teacher"" title she has. She is animated when she describes the leadership and community service programs she also runs. Meanwhile, Kenny seems to have forgotten that he has our laundry in his washer and dryer... I'm sure we'll get through this night OK, and we'll be back on the trail tomorrow.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter
","Palmerton, PA","Apr 16, Sun",17.40
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560482,"This morning we checked out of the Blue Mountain Summit B&B and drove back to Slatington. We hiked across the bridge to Palmerton then almost immediately had to climb a serious rock pile about 1200 feet up. This was a boulder climb with rocks bigger than we were. After walking a short distance on relatively flat ground at the top of that climb, we came to the Palmerton Superfund detour. The Superfund site itself is an area where nothing grew for years, after toxic materials produced as byproducts of zinc mining spoiled the land. The trail had been re-routed around it while remediation efforts are underway. We could see from the trail that all the old trees there are dead, but I was also glad to see that bushes and small pine trees seem to be emerging now - at least in the area we could observe.After about 5 miles, we met Willie at a road crossing and had a snack. We then hiked across mostly rocky terrain until we met Willie again at our 13-mile point, where we had lunch. Then we finished the day's journey logging a total of 16.1 miles, stopping at the Leroy Smith shelter. There was only one other hiker already there, but we chose to set up in the camping area. So I am spending another beautiful night under my tarp. Tonight, like most nights recently, it is supposed to only get down to 41 F. So I've had to learn how to unzip and regulate temp so as to not overheat and dehydrate in my sleeping bag. Tomorrow Willie and Judi will be getting off the trail for a while, and John and I will continue and hike at least as far as the Kirkbridge shelter, possibly pushing on to Delaware Water Gap, finishing our trip through Pennsylvania, and starting the NJ section the following day.","Palmerton, PA
",Leroy Smith Shelter Campsite,"Apr 17, Mon",16.10
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560681,"Today was a long, hard day. Over 20 miles, most of which was feet-beatingly painful rocky terrain. After saying farewell to Judi and Willie, John and I headed out and hiked all day, to get to Delaware Water Gap, PA. Along the way, we saw the April Fools, going south. Apparently, they got a ride and were hiking part of the same section of trail we were, but in the opposite direction. Later, we passed a German couple that Aaron had been hiking with and had spoken about. They were from Stuttgart, and I got to practice a couple German words chatting with them.In the afternoon, we passed a guy I had seen at least three times before, each time heading south, but each time in a location further north than the last. This time, I stopped and asked him about that. He goes by ""Slo Mo"" and he carries a huge backpack with an old-school external frame. He is driving two cars, leap-frogging them north and each time walking southward to get back to his other car. This makes him the only north - bound hiker I've met who only walks south! Anyway, as we approached DWG, walking along the top of the ridge line, we had a beautiful view of the Delaware River, the boundary between PA and NJ. With sore feet, we finished the walk and stopped at the Church of the Mountain Hiker's center, which is a free hostel (will make donation tomorrow). Dinner down the street, discussed strategy for next couple days. Bed time now. Very tired.","Leroy Smith Shelter Campsite
",Delaware Water Gap,"Apr 18, Tue",20.10
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560735,"So today is the first time I've decided to try to start my Trail Journals entry in the middle of the day rather than in the evening. This morning John and I left the Church of the Mountain Hiker in Delaware Water Gap where we had stayed at the hostel and walked a couple of miles of flat ground across the Interstate 80 bridge over the Delaware River into New Jersey. Both of us were very stiff and sore from yesterday's beating on the rocks of the last 20 miles of Pennsylvania. As we entered the wood line, John stopped to remove the down jacket he had been wearing at the beginning of the day and I kept hiking. At about the three mile point I got a phone call from John and he said that the pain in his shin was too severe to continue walking on it and he had decided to go back to Delaware Water Gap. He said that he was planning to try to mail some of his gear back to North Carolina and that he would call his wife to come get him. I felt bad about that and partially responsible. It had been his idea to walk the full 20 miles and finally be done with Pennsylvania yesterday, but I had encouraged him. And there had been several places where we could have stopped yesterday. But against argument he told me to keep hiking and I did.It's only ten o'clock in the morning right now as I write this, but I can see the terrain here in New Jersey is already very different from that which we hiked in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania it was mainly climb up and then a hike across the top of a long ridgeline, hike down and then repeat. Just on the other side of the Delaware River this terrain is more a broad forest on top of an elevated piece of ground and I've already come across several ponds such as the Sunfish Pond by which I'm sitting on a bench right now. I uploaded a picture of this.From Sunfish Pond I continued to hike on to the Mohican Outdoor Center at about the ten mile mark. There I had lunch, refilled water, charged my phone and joined the Appalachian Mountain Club. I also bought four more Clif bars and another pair of medium cushion Smartwool socks. Leaving the Mohican Outdoor Center, I met two hikers carrying fishing poles: a father and son named Brian and Julian. They were embarking on a few days of outdoor fun. Further on up the trail I came to the Catfish Lookout Tower under which I spotted a familiar silhouette, and although it was painted white I recognized it immediately. Looking closer I saw the data plates on the shelter read AN/TRC-145B (Track 145) which is an Army shelter, a multi-channel radio terminal identical to several that I had in my platoon when I was a Lieutenant in Germany in 1986! (see photos)It started raining on and off about 2:30 in the afternoon. I wore my Gore-Tex raincoat because the rain was cold and there was a lot of wind, but I kept the front zip open so I could regulate body heat. At about mile marker 13 I met a family of four hikers out for some pre-hike training. They intend to start a flip-flop hike from Harpers Ferry (like I did) after the 25th of April, but they've been out here for three days and are headed back in now. Their trail names are Weeble, Painter, Bandana and Cricket. The dad says his name is Weeble because he's hoping to get rid of the Weeble belly and, ""Weebles wobble but they don't fall down!"" The youngest, a 75 pound boy is named Cricket because he likes to jump all the time. I walked with them for about a half a mile and used my navigation app to help get them to a parking lot where they were able to call a shuttle to come pick them up. After taking a group photo with them, I got back on the trail.At about 6 pm, instead of setting up camp, I decided to keep hiking and I came upon a group of students chaperoned by 2 adults and I chatted with them for a while. They were Nick and Lottie with a group from Philadelphia 8th Grade Outward Bound. They were enthusiastic and inquisitive but tired and sore. I took a photo with them (uploaded) and we wished each other good luck and good day! I will continue hiking and may try out hiking at night some with my headlamp using the red light.I was able to hike until about 9 pm using just ambient light; however, after 8:30 it was dark enough so that I needed to look for the trail markers using my peripheral vision which is more sensitive than what you see looking straight ahead. So, from about 9 pm onward, for the first time, I hiked with my headlamp and I'll tell you that learning how to use its different configurations has been an adventure in itself! It has a white light setting with multiple variations on how much light it produces like high beams and low beams. If you hold the button down for 2 seconds it will shine a red light so as not to ruin your night vision or to be less bothersome to other hikers in camp. To return to white light from red light, you hold the button for 3 seconds. But, if you don't time it right, and hold instead for 4 seconds, it will enter ""lock"" mode which is for when you want it to remain off and also to prevent inadvertently turning it on (like with butt dialing) so as to ensure you don't accidentally drain the battery with a headlamp on while tucked away in your pack. This only works if it has been in the white light setting and is currently off. Anyway, I hiked by headlamp for another 30 minutes and arrived at Brink Road shelter at about 9:30 pm. There I ran into another Outward Bound group (12 or so) from Philly and chatted with them for a little while and their leader gave me a business card and mentioned that Outward Bound has free programs for vets and I told him I would pass that information on to others.I found my way to the shelter and set up as quietly as I could, as there was one hiker already there.","Delaware Water Gap
",Brink Road Shelter,"Apr 19, Wed",24.80
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560875,"Well I met the other hiker who was at the Brink Road shelter this morning when we got up at dawn. His name is Arthur and he is a paramedic. His wife is a lawyer with her own practice and they're both in their mid-sixties. Arthur was previously a commercial banker but with a consolidation of the commercial banking market in America, what was in 1970s 17,000 independent commercial banking entities is now about six commercial banks. In the process of consolidation, lots of folks who were at that time making over 6 figures lost their jobs.
Having recently come from Pennsylvania, I want to put this down now before I forget it. It's not so much a journal entry for today, but represents thoughts I've been accumulating over the past couple of weeks. It's about rocks. I was remembering the movie Forrest Gump when Forest is in Vietnam and you're hearing him narrate a letter he was writing to his mother or Jenny I can't remember. He said in Vietnam there are lots of kinds of rain: there is light rain and heavy rain and slow rain and fast rain and rain that just drips and sometimes it comes down in buckets and sometimes it even comes up from underneath. Well in my experience here, I've come to appreciate that there are lots of kinds of rocks! There are big boulder rocks and little rocks and round rocks and flat rocks and sharp rocks and rocks that you can hop on and rocks that you can trip on and rocks that are dry and rocks that are slippery when wet and rocks that come up underneath that aren't sharp but because they are smaller than your foot sharply penetrate boots, rocks that are ankle busters and foot fighters and after hiking over these all day long, your feet maintain the memory of them in the way they hurt! So this morning after we got up, Arthur and I both ate breakfast and chatted for awhile. Before getting fully underway on the trail today, I first filled bottles and treated the water from the water source near the Brink Road shelter. So shortly after 7:15 I am off, once again headed north. If I have the stamina for it, my plan is to try to make it to the Rutherford shelter which I think is around 15 miles so not quite as grueling as the last couple of days. I'm currently walking on a damp trail, on wet leaves which seem to be muffling all the sounds. I can hear individual water droplets hitting them in the forest as they fall off the trees, but it is not raining at the moment. The forecast is for 50% chance of rain today, so once again I'm hiking in Gore-Tex. It happens to be cold enough right now so that's not a heat problem, but I might have to adapt.
I had a lively texting session with the family biologist, my daughter Jenna about green/blue colored dead wood, chlorophyll and Red Eft Salamanders. I’ll get back to that later. (see photo)
At about 11 o'clock I came across a couple headed southbound on a short 5-day section hike. They warned me about a brown snake in some water ahead on the trail in my direction and I told them about the black snake I saw yesterday (reminder to self – have Jenna help me identify the species of the snakes I encounter). Before I actually got to the water with the brown snake, I came across an observation tower with another old US Army communications shelter on the ground underneath it. I guess they're using the radio shelters to enable the observation towers to talk to each other – perhaps for Emergency Services. There's a sign at the base of the big tower that says no trespassing without permission from NJFFS and there's phone number. I assume that is New Jersey forestry or forest fire service?
At about 11:30 am I came to a small creek near the Gren Anderson shelter, and I think this is probably the place where the couple had seen the brown snake; although I looked for it, I couldn't find it. I was on the lookout, though as I stopped to fill another liter of water to replace what I’ve consumed during the trip here from the Brink Road shelter this morning.At about 2:30 in the afternoon, as the sun started coming out a little, I also felt myself running out of energy and I don't mean just the power in my phone's battery. I took a break and ate another Clif Bar and drank some water and continued on to the Mashipacong shelter. There I took another break, rested my feet and actually removed a thorn from my sock in the heel of my foot where it have been poking me. I sign the log book at the shelter and since at that point it was only a little after 3 o'clock and I had only done about 13 miles I decided to just try to continue on slowly and make it to the next shelter so as to reduce the miles I will have to do tomorrow to get to Unionville New York. It may really be more so tomorrow's story, but the Appalachian Trail penetrates into New York only a couple of times very briefly around Unionville and it is turned back as if by the forces defending the southern border of New York from the invading scourge of thru-hikers. The trail is forced to skirt the border with New York but remain inside New Jersey all the way down to Greenwood Lake south of Belleville and Warwick New York where it is finally allowed to penetrate the southern border and enter southern New York wildlands.","Brink Road Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561005,"It rained all night last night which was a good test for my tarp. It hasn't been tested as thoroughly before as it was last night. It performed well and I stayed dry and snug as a bug. I slept well, but at some point around 1:00 am a wild animal jumped on me! Fortunately, it weighed only a fraction of an ounce so I was able to overpower it. I'm still not sure if it was a tiny frog or a cricket, but it was cold and wet and when I tried to brush it away it clung to my finger. My reaction was not manly! 
In the morning I woke up at around 5:40 as light was dawning. I packed up my things under the tarp, and then took down and stowed the tarp itself. A pack of tuna salad and two peanut butter and jelly tortillas were breakfast. After saying farewell, good day and be safe to the students from Brown (a group from a hiking club were at the Rutherford shelter for the night), I left camp. Once I had filtered and treated another liter of water at the stream on the side trail on the way out, I hit the actual AT northbound at about 7:30 am. At about 9 a.m. I came to the High Point State Park headquarters and stopped in to charge my phone and fill another liter of water. I also took a bit of a break and had a snack of hard salami. Knowing that I was going to resupply in Unionville, I figure if I have to carry food, it's just as well that I carry it inside me as in my backpack! At about 9:45, just as I was about to leave a guy came in wearing a Cabela's hat and asked how my hike was going and how I was fixed for food. He explained that he had driven up from his home about 45 minutes away to set up some trail Magic for hikers. He offered to take me to a grocery store that would be better stocked than the options I would be looking forward to in Unionville, so I took him up on the offer and he drove me to a ShopRite somewhere between Sussex, NJ and Point Jervis, NY. He explained that he had been following a hiker on Facebook and YouTube who was about to arrive at Delaware Water Gap today or tomorrow and he was hoping to put some trail magic out in front of him. He asked about my trail name and I told him and explained the story. He told me that his was Snorz, a name bestowed on him because he could clear out an entire shelter in a heartbeat! After I got some grub and stopped at the ATM, he drove me back to the High Point State Park headquarters and gave me some Jolly Ranchers to take with me on the Trail. I thanked him and set out to hike on.
After leaving the state park headquarters, about a mile and a half later I crossed the feature for which the park is named. This is the highest point in New Jersey at 1804 feet. However, there was nothing to see due to the complete cloud cover. The trail then meandered downhill through forests in which I observed a number of stone walls. I wonder who made them and what for? I imagine that the woods that are not part of the forest may have one day been someone's farmland and that it took every able hand in a family to pile up all these stones. Eventually the trail emerged into some actual modern farm land and crossed several grassy fields. Off to my right I saw some sheep grazing.
After walking through a bog of mud water and sometimes elevated boards, I finally came to Lott Road which leads to Unionville, NY. I went into town (about 3/10th of a mile) stopped at Horlers grocery store, signed in to get a permit to stay in the public park overnight and bought a Diet Coke. I sat on the porch of the grocery store deciding whether I should have set up in the park and leave my stuff there and then go run some errands or carry my pack with me and set up camp after dinner. I chose the latter. I walked about a half-mile down the street to a different grocery store where I purchased a new USB charger for the brick I brought from home to provide extra power for my phone. At Wit's End Tavern I had hot wings and a burger for dinner. I met guys named Al and Stacy (Stan) and Al's helper whose name I can't remember. Al owns a Service Master franchise and his helper lives near Sunrise Mountain where I was 2 days ago. He invited me to stay at his house but I was going the other way.
After dinner at the Wit's End Tavern, I went back down the street past the Horlers grocery store and stopped for ""dessert"" at Angelina's Italian pizzeria. After having a personal pepperoni pizza and some gknots (garlic pizza knots), I was finally feeling actually really full (I estimate I'm burning 4-6,000 calories a day). So now I'm back across the street and have set up my tarp and campsite in the public park and I got ready for bed. Good night!","Rutherford Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561127,"Happy Earth Day! 
[Teresa here: I made the mistake of googling “crime death injury Appalachian Trail.” There have been murders/bodies found on/near the trail and some deaths due to injuries/falls/drowning. I read a NY Times article about the tragic story of Geraldine Largay, 66, who got lost in Maine and died of exposure/starvation in Aug 2013, but her body was not found (by loggers) until 2015. She was 2 miles off the trail and text messages she sent were never received, as there was no cellular service in that area. Her husband had been driving ahead and meeting her in prearranged spots with supplies and sometimes took her to motels for showers and nights indoors. He knew when she didn’t show up at an arranged meeting point that she was lost and her position eluded expert searchers. Just awful. Anyway, I asked GI Joe via text if he'd heard of any of the murders that have occurred on the AT and related that I probably should not look into these things and invent a Steven King novel scenario in my mind. I did, of course urge him to keep his head up!]

Now back to Joe: After texting with Teresa some about some AT tragedies, I told her that I guess it wouldn't be a real adventure without some peril. In Bill Bryson's book A Walk in the Woods he also mentions that in 1996 two women hikers were stabbed to death in the northern part of the Shenandoah National Forest in Virginia. So far in my experience the greatest risks have been ways of falling. In OSHA parlance, it's slips trips and falls. One mitigates risk by identifying hazards and putting appropriate controls in place to reduce it. In climbing, for example, I always try to make sure I have three solid points of contact. That is often more important in the descent than in the ascent. Also, as I’ve highlighted over the last several days, when it rains the rocks which would otherwise provide excellent traction are often slippery when the thick lichen covering them gets moist. So whereas I would prefer to step on them on a dry day, I have had to avoid them in the last couple days.

This morning I woke up around 5:30 am, packed up my campsite and went back to the Horler's grocery store for breakfast. I had two large cups of coffee with whole milk and sugar and a sausage, egg and cheese on a hard roll thingy. The nice lady behind the counter also graciously filled up both of my one liter water bottles for me. I sat on the deck and ate my breakfast and drank coffee while my phone charged. Then I headed back out of town to the trail head. It was only three tenths of a mile but of course it was uphill. I reminded myself that yesterday, after a full day of hiking, that descent into town was a welcomed direction of slope! I got on the actual AT around 7:25. The first several miles this morning were through farm fields and adjacent forests like yesterday, including some buggy swampland through which I had to walk on elevated platforms constructed by AT maintainers - many thanks to them! At one point I had a nice view of low hanging clouds only a couple dozen meters above the fields and houses in the distance - see photo. 

At about 3.5 miles northbound from Unionville, I came to a wildlife refuge area where I could see and hear a wide variety of birds including: geese, ducks, red-wing blackbirds and others. In the middle of the trail at one point I also saw the bodies of what I believed were a mouse and a mole rat (photo). They looked like they had been locked in some kind of combat which didn't go well for either of them. Not long after I came to the Pochuck Mountain shelter where I stopped for a snack. Attached is a snapshot of the logbook entries there.

This evening I am settling into a location near the Wawayanda shelter. There is a group of a dozen or so Boy Scouts from Troop 66 out of Monmouth County, NJ. The boys are setting up tents, but the adult chaperones are already in the shelter. Technically thru hikers have priority in the shelters, but my tarp is wet from being rained on the last two nights, so I wanted to set it up to let it dry anyway. So instead of crowding into the shelter with the three other guys who are already there, I will camp under my tarp.

It's comforting having other people around. I ate dinner with some of them while the troop leader took the rest on an expedition to explore nearby mines. The boys came back saying they found a hole in the ground. They were clearly underwhelmed by the experience. 

After 2 days of being rained on and put away wet my tarp was the heaviest thing in my backpack. And that's saying something because my food bag is full and it's over 5 pounds. There is a chance of rain tonight, but it’s slight, so I'm hoping it won't rain and my tarp will get to dry out.

Well, it’s about 7 pm and I'm in my sleeping bag already and I want to let my phone charge off the brick before I go to sleep. Goodnight!","Unionville, NY

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561289,"I woke about 5:30 and was packed and ready to hit the trail by 6:15. After 2 days of being rained on and put away wet, my tarp was the heaviest thing in my backpack. And that's saying something, because my food bag is full and it weighs over 5 lbs! Happy it got a chance to dry out last night. None of the Boy Scout Troop 66 folks were awake yet, so I didn't get to say goodbye or wish them a good day. I stopped briefly at the Wawayanda park office (.25 mile up the trail) to use the restroom, get water, and charge my phone some.
It didn't take too long and it was sort of like a nature walk finishing up the hike out of New Jersey's Wawayanda Swamp. I was at the New York/ New Jersey border by 10 am.
The trail north of the NJ/NY border in southern NY became much wilder than I had seen in Pennsylvania or New Jersey. In many places it was difficult to see where the trail was, and at times there was no discernible path. The traditional AT markers, white blazes, were present on the trees, but it took a concerted effort to find and identify them. The terrain became rougher as well, and I had to stow my poles in order to use both hands and both feet to negotiate a rock climb within the first half mile of the trail in southern NY. Immediately above that rock climb there was a ladder built into a wall of rock that I had to go up to get to the top of the first peak. From there I was able to gain a nice view of the surrounding countryside (see photo). I took some pictures of what must be Greenwood Lake, NJ off to the southeast from this rocky outcrop.
I made a contribution to each of two rock cairns on successive peaks within a mile north of that rocky outcrop, and although steep, the climbing here was relatively safe and easy because the sun was bright and had dried what would have yesterday been a slippery surface.
[Note from Base Operations (Teresa): I heard from GI Joe just before 3 this afternoon when he was about 1.5 miles from the Wildcat shelter. He was turning off his phone to save power in case of emergency. I've bought a new Goal Zero Flip3 rechargeable battery for him. It is lighter than the brick he has and is supposed to charge a phone 3 times. We'll have to see how that works. He's thinking the cold last night made the energy drain faster than usual. He's prepared with paper maps and compass, but the AT app he's using has been very useful. And of course I appreciate the daily texts that he's alive and well on his journey! The plan for tomorrow is for him to hike 14.3 miles to the Fingerboard Shelter. I'm looking forward to seeing him for a zero mile day at The United States Military Academy at West Point, NY in a couple of days.] Paragraph. Ok, here is what I could not finish recording yesterday. There were some great nice views from high places, Ann's some challenging climbs like ""cat rock"" right before the wildcat shelter. When I arrived, I h9ad the shelter to myself. I did the basic stuff, like normal, but I decided to practice boiling water for my dinner meal with a small ""cook fire"". This took a lot more work than I anticipated. After three days of rain, the small sticks I was using weren't dry enough to ligbt easily with just whittled wood shavings for kindling. I had to use a cotton ball with some Vaseline as a starter, and I dripped some candle wax onto my wood shavings. That got it going. I fashioned a ""sacred cooking tripod"" from three four for sticks that I lashed together with 550 cord. From that, I suspended my cook pot with another piece of 550 cord, using a ""taught line hitch"" so I could adjust its height above the fire. I had to continuously tend this little fire to keep it going, and I had to oxegenate it's embers a couple times, to get it to ignite newly added sticks. But the bottom line ous it worked. I had a full putt okc boiled water with which I made potatos with olives, olive oil, beef broth, and a dash of tomato powder and one packet of Texas Pete hot sauce. I ate amd went to sleep after putting the fire out completely and storing my bear bag in the bear box located about 50 yards from the shelter. Paragraph. At about 730pm, I was awakened by the arrival of two other hikers. Trailnames Dory and Turmeric. They are 17 and 18 yrs old, the younger already a highschool grad taking a gap year to finish the hike she started last year. The older is a home-schooled student, and he is not looking to go to college right away. They met at summer camp a few years ago."," Camping Near Wawayanda Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561499,"Today was an exciting hike. I got up at about 5 am, had a peanut butter tortilla for breakfast, and was under way by 6:30. My phone was off to conserve power until I could recharge it and the backup battery brick, so I regret that I could not take pictures of things I saw, like Fitzgerald Falls in the early morning. The first several miles were relatively easy, but the trail introduced me to the first of what would be many boulder scrambles on very steep slopes. These took a lot of effort, but it paid off with beautiful views. 
At Little Dam Lake, after I had just filled and treated a liter of water, Slo Mo (remember he’s the nobo who only walks south – leapfrogging two cars northbound) came rolling in from the north side of the stream I had stopped at. He was wearing his usual wide brimmed hat, but today he also had on a ""no-see-um"" bug net over his hat and entire head. He looked tired. He had just started this section about three miles north. 
At about 11am, I found a cache of trail magic that Slo Mo had told me about. I ate a package of ramen noodles dry, straight out of the wrapper, washing it down with cherry coke. I signed the log book and thanked ""Heavenly T. Angel.""
After several more step scrambles up and down, I met three hikers who told me what I was about to climb down was called ""Agony's Grind."" It certainly earns its title because it was difficult and even more so dangerous due to all the leaves covering many of the rocks. 
At about 12:45 I crossed a bridge that took me over Route 17 and Interstate 87. Then I entered Harriman State Park. About 3 miles later, I encountered the section known as the ""Lemon Squeezer"" - picture a narrow channel between two long 8' boulders, so close together that you have to remove your backpack, push it up onto the boulder on the left so you can climb thru and then get up onto that rock to get your pack back. And that's part one. Part two again required removal of backpack and tossing it up onto an 8' rock wall near a 30’ cliff. Then w/o backpack, I could safely get the finger and foot holds needed to climb the wall myself. Exhilarating! For hikers not feeling up to that task there is an alternate route – a blue arrow on a sign which reads “easy way” and points in a different direction.
 I hiked on and stopped at the Fingerboard shelter only long enough for a snack and to sign the log book. Then, acting on a tip I got from Dory and Turmeric the previous day, I hiked another mile and went 0.3 mi off trail to get to Tiorati Circle, where I found a restroom with a power outlet I could use to charge my phone and backup battery. 
It's 9 pm and I'm settled into the William Brien shelter. There are 2 nobo hikers here who both started in Georgia in February. Stamp is a 25 year old guy and Silver Girl is just out of college. They hike about 25 miles a day. They both said today was a hard day for them and that made me feel better. It was a relatively long day for me at 19 something, and I found the climbing very strenuous. Goodnight!","Wildcat Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561607,"Along with Stamp and Silver Girl, we woke about 5 am. I packed up and had a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter for breakfast and was on the trail by about 6 am. Silver Girl had actually left first, about 15 minutes before I did. The trail started immediately with the scramble up a pile of wet rocks right next to the shelter. It continued up Black Mountain where I'm sure there would have been some nice views if not for the fog. It rained all day today, so going was significantly slower than yesterday for safety reasons. Four miles in, at the top of West Mountain, I stopped and had a more substantial breakfast of tuna salad burritos. Stamp caught up to me at that time and I was able to actually see what he looked like. That was not possible earlier or the night before because it had been relatively dark. He appeared much as he had sounded: 25 years old, light brown hair and beard and slim after having been on the trail since early February. After Crossing Seven Lakes Drive at about mile 5, I came across a tall thin man wearing orange rain gear carrying an enormous pack with an osprey rain cover on it. He was moving very slowly. I said good morning and we chatted a little bit. He admitted that he was struggling with the climbing over the last couple of days. He had done a 350 mile section mainly in Virginia last year with the same equipment I gather, and it had not been such a problem. His plan had been to go as far as Rutland Vermont. But he said that was not going to work, because even without food and a little water his stuff was just too heavy. So he said he intended to call it quits after today. He told me his Trail name is Bigfoot and I encouraged him to see if he could get some rest and lighten his load and then maybe try again. He nodded and said, ""Yeah, maybe."" We wished each other good luck and continued climbing.
At about 10 past 10 I arrived at Bear Mountain itself and could see the Perkins Memorial Tower at which I took a picture and more importantly I spotted three vending machines near a maintenance building. I had only one dollar bill and no change but the machines accepted credit card, so I paid for a regular Coca-Cola and small sized can of Pringles with my Visa card. I think that cost me about $4 but it tasted fantastic and I think the perk was worth the price. I wandered around the tower on the paved circular and gravel pathways, and I took some pictures of the view out over the Hudson River. 

As I still had three miles to go to get to the actual Bear Mountain Bridge where I had originally planned to meet Teresa, I got back on the trip going. Teresa and I had texted and discussed that since I had hiked more miles than originally planned yesterday, my distance today would be shorter and I would be arriving sooner than expected as a result.

My first use of the extra time was just to take it easy on the remaining portion of the trail for today. After descending Bear Mountain, I arrived at the Bear Mountain Inn and had a leisurely walk through its grounds. Next up was the Bear Mountain Zoo where Teresa and I had taken our children when Joey was 4 and Jenna was a baby. My book says that the Bear Den at the zoo is the lowest point on the Appalachian Trail at 177 feet above sea level. A sign in the zoo, however says that it is at 126 feet above sea level. There was also an historical marker for the Appalachian Trail and a display with more historical information on the origination and construction of the trail and the people who built the first shelters along it. I took some pictures and then left the zoo and arrived at the south or west end of the Bear Mountain Bridge. Instead of continuing on the trail, I turned left and walked a few feet to the Bear Mountain traffic circle and called a taxi to take me to Highland Falls so that I could get signed into our lodging at West Point and maybe get my laundry done while I wait for Teresa to arrive this evening.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561803,"I enjoyed having a day off the trail today. Rest, relaxation, resupply and reminiscing... while visiting a place filled with memories of when we lived here in the 90s while I was teaching Physics to Cadets at the United States Military Academy. Joey was 3 and loved hearing his voice echo in the cannons on Trophy Point, throwing pebbles into the Hudson River and 2 of his favorite toys were a bugle kazoo and a drum strapped around his neck so he could mimick the Cadets he loved watching march in parade practice. One of the happiest days of my life occurred here when bright and beautiful baby Jenna joined our family one snowy November morning.Teresa brought my new boots, and I got to put a couple of break-in miles on them walking around the USMA grounds and into Highland Falls for a couple of meals. Check out the picture I uploaded comparing them to my old boots, showing the wear of just three weeks (200 miles) on the trail. Generally, I have liked the fit and feel. REI has agreed to refund the first pair, since they should have lasted over 500 miles and certainly more than two weeks before beginning to fall apart.I cut a few items from my pack, and exchanged my old external battery for a new one. We also went shopping at the West Point commissary and PX, where I got my first haircut and beard-trim since I started hiking. I also decided to try out an external battery with a built-in solar charger called a Jetsun. I'm not sure how well it will work, but I will give it a try. I managed to rig a way to fasten it in a sort of holster similar to a runner's phone sleeve for the upper arm, attaching it instead to the top of my pack using Velcro and a piece of 550 cord. I'm hoping this will provide a relatively secure way of keeping it in a position where it can collect solar energy while I'm hiking.
After we had dinner in Highland Falls, Teresa and I did most of the production of three sets of 4-day food supplies. 2 of the boxes are for future mail drops. One will comprise the contents of my food bag as I get back on the trail tomorrow. Teresa may join me on the trail for a few miles. Goodnight!","Bear Mountain Bridge

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562036,"This morning was to conclude a very nice stay at the Beat Navy House on West Point. After packing I took advantage of the opportunity to have one more good breakfast meal before getting on the road, and Teresa and I finalized our plans for her to hike with me some today and meet me after I hiked today's miles. She will lighten my load a bit by carrying about 4 lbs of food for the coming days. While eating breakfast, we had a chance to meet some members of the West Point Class of 1957, interesting and energetic people. Then we loaded the car and Teresa drove us to the Bear Mountain Inn where we hiked together for a few miles. Simply due to non-availability of other options for parking I had some overlap re-hiking the section that goes through the Bear Mountain Zoo and part of its park area up to the actual Bear Mountain Bridge.
 Teresa and I hiked across the bridge and she had an opportunity to take several photos that I hope she will upload later today. 

When I met Silver Girl at the Brien shelter a couple days ago, I had asked her 
what food secrets she had picked up after hiking for three months from Georgia. She showed me a bunch of stuff including a product called Mio. So yesterday when Teresa and I shopped at the 
commissary at West Point, I picked up two types of Mio. I can't help but notice that it colored my water, and they now appear to me to be like the potions in the video game I used to play with Joey and Jenna called Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. :-) Curiously, it is in fact true that the red potion, because it has caffeine and vitamins is energizing! And the green potion, because it has electrolytes and B vitamins... well, it provides Magic.! Haha. I actually have no idea what these Mio drops will do, and I doubt I am going to want to continue to have full liters of artificially colored water.

Today's plan was for Teresa to hike with me for a couple miles in the morning and then we'd meet up at a road crossing at approximately my 10 Mile point. This would allow my first day back on the trail to be in a relatively conservative fashion for a couple of reasons. For starters, it would allow my feet more recovery from the beating I gave them in the last 20 miles coming out of Pennsylvania followed by the 24 mile day in New Jersey a little less than a week ago. Also, it will give me a chance to break in my new boots. So I planned less miles than usual and Teresa would deliver 3 days worth of food when we meet up. We got started at the Bear Mountain Bridge at about 10:30 am. Around 12:30 I stopped for a short break to eat a Snickers bar drink some of my potions (haha) and make an initial entry in today's Trail Journal. I noticed that at this time I had gone 5 miles despite the fact that I had had an aggregate of about 1000 feet of elevation and maybe three hundred feet of loss. That put me in about an hour ahead of the conservative schedule that I had initially thought I would maintain during today's hike. Other than the initial climb after the Bear Mountain Bridge, the trail had been relatively easy this morning. I think this speed was in part due to simply being fully rested and refueled so to speak after having yesterday off. Perhaps the caffeine in both the morning coffee and my water had something to do with it!

I came to South Highland Road where Teresa was parked with the car at about 4:30 this afternoon. I was soaked in sweat and as the bugs were swarming around us as we were trying to talk I had an epiphany. Teresa was going to go back to the DVQ at West Point and spend another night before driving back to Maryland and I was going to camp near the bugs. Something is not right with this picture! Although I opened this journal saying I was concluding my stay at the DVQ at West Point, we both headed back there again, and in the morning Teresa will bring me back out again to South Highland Road where I will proceed onward from where I ended today. Goodnight!","USMA, West Point

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562195,"This morning I was able to take advantage of the breakfast offering at the DVQ at West Point before we loaded up the car and drove to South Highland Road where I had ended yesterday's hike. While enroute we discussed the details associated with the next two mail drops that Teresa is going to send me. Also, part of what we did during our off day was to not only restock my food bag but also to prepare two boxes of three to four days worth (8 lbs each) of food for mail shipment. 
In contrast to yesterday's weather which was completely overcast with short periods of rain, today's weather was fantastic - beautiful sunshine blue sky with just a few white puffy clouds and warm, but not so hot as to be oppressive. Now loaded up with a full 4 day supply basic load of food and two full liters of water, my pack was obviously a little heavier than it had been when I arrived on Tuesday. 
So I set out at a nice casual pace enjoying the sunshine and noticing that it was passing through leaves that had just begun to grow out beyond the early budding stage. At one point I noted something that I had heard earlier about the Harriman State Park - it lacks underbrush. During significant portions of today's hike, basically an easy nature walk, I saw that you could see long distances in every direction with trees spaced 10 to 30 feet apart with no significant undergrowth. Apparently Harriman State Park’s lack of underbrush was due to “no hunting” laws and an overpopulation of deer clearing the underbrush, so I speculate that the same may be the case here in Putnam County. 
At about 12:30 I stopped for a break at a beautiful set of Falls which was just downstream from a beaver dam pond. I had the remainder of my first liter of water for the day and refilled the bottle, treating it with aquamira using the method described in the caption of a photo uploaded yesterday. The water looks clear and clean, but I understand beavers can be carriers of giardia.  Every experienced hiker I encounter is fearful of this microscopic parasite found in back country streams. It can cause intestinal infection characterized  by abdominal cramps, pain and diarrhea. 
About 1 p.m. the trail joined the Marquez Taconic Regional trails. With the exception of a few small climbs the trail stayed relatively level and easy. At about 1:30 I saw that the trail proceeded over what appeared to be a very high stone wall. Because of the size of a tree and associated roots growing out of the top of the same wall, I could tell that it was very old. This was unlike any of the stone walls I had seen in forests earlier, the ones which I’d imagined were boundary markers of old family farms. This one was well over 10 feet tall in some places. So I checked  the electronic map in my Gut Hooks AT guide application and saw that my location was marked as that of an old mining road. 
At some point prior to 2 p.m. when the trail crossed New York Route 301, I could begin to see Canopus Lake off to the right as the trail entered Clarence Fahnestock State Park. After less than a quarter-mile the trail came to a steep rock ledge and I couldn't help but notice that today the trail was going around an obstacle where as a few days ago the trail maintainers had chosen to route the trail straight up the middle. This time I had juice in my phone, so I could capture a picture.
Sometime after 2 p.m. I passed mile marker 1423 which means I’ve logged 400 miles since leaving Harpers Ferry (mile marker 1023). 
Just before 4 p.m. I ascended Shenandoah Mountain, NY (not to be confused with the Shenandoah mountains in Virginia obviously). There were great views to the south from where I could hear the sound of traffic from the Taconic State Parkway. I imagine that on a good night you could probably see the effects of the lighting of New York City. Heading northward as I am, the view is somewhat obstructed by small trees and shrubs, but I could vaguely see the outlines of civilization and I know that in that general direction lies East Fishkill and then Hopewell Junction. I descended the north side of Shenandoah Mountain and sometime shortly after 4 p.m. I crossed Long Hill Road and left Putnam County and entered Dutchess County, NY.
I arrived at the Ralph’s Peak Hikers (RPH) shelter at about 5 p.m. and saw that Dori and Turmeric were already there. After a day off in the Fort Montgomery area staying at the Fairmount Inn, they took their time hiking and arrived here at the RPH shelter earlier today and just decided to stay put. I also met a southbound hiker in his fifties wearing a grey shirt grey hiking pants and a bandana on his head. He also had a grey beard and was wearing reading glasses. After chatting I learned that his Trail name was Crazy Puke due to an incident which had happened when he was hiking with a group of guys when he was younger. Apparently after having over-indulged he was observed to projectile vomit at a distance of at least 10 feet. So this inspired his friends to name him Crazy Puke. He had ordered pizza and soda with delivery to a road a stone's throw from the shelter and I accepted his offer to share some of the pizza. What a concept - pizza delivery to the Appalachian Trail! 
The water from the hand pump at the shelter was rather brown and cloudy, so although I treated it, I decided not to try to use it. So I went southward on the trail about a tenth of a mile to a stream crossing I’d seen just before arriving at the shelter and filled and treated two liters. I also took the previously obtained/treated water (from stream at the outlet of the beaver dam) and filtered it using my Sawyer squeeze water filter. Half of it I used to make a 16 ounce bottle green electrolyte Mio. As the three bottom bunks were already taken in the shelter, I had set myself up on one of the top bunks, but at about 8:15 p.m. when it was getting dark Turmeric announced that he was going to sleep outside and offered his bottom bunk for me to use. So I guess we'll see here in a few minutes what final arrangements I end up with, but otherwise I'm ready for bed.","South Highland Road
",RPH Shelter,"Apr 28, Fri",13.40
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562362,"I woke up this morning around 6 and got up around 6:30. I remembered hearing the sound of rain somewhere around 3 o'clock in the morning. And when I woke up I saw that Tumeric had moved his sleeping bag and mat and was sleeping on top of one of the picnic tables under the overhang attached to the shelter so that he was not exposed to the rain. I ate breakfast and chatted with Dory, Turmeric and Crazy Puke for a bit. Crazy Puke hit the trail first about 7 a.m. and I was headed north at about 7:30. After only a few minutes the trail went under Taconic State Parkway underpass and continued North. I took a picture just for the record.

At about 10:30 I crossed Route 52 and just because I could, I stopped at the Mountain Market & Deli next to Danny's Pizza. I picked up a couple of Clif bars and plugged my phone and brick in to recharge for a bit while I refilled one of my water bottles from their spigot and ate my Clif bars.

Oh I forgot to mention that last night I learned the origin of Dory’s and Turmeric’s Trail names. When Dori was hiking with her father last summer, evidently she kept forgetting things at the last place they had stayed so her father named her after the forgetful fish in Finding Nemo. And her hiking buddy - well, he likes turmeric. He carries it with him and adds it to his food because it is anti-inflammatory and helps with the tendonitis he experiences in his knees.

2 o'clock in the afternoon. It is hot! About 85 Degrees according to my thermometer / compass dangly thing that Teresa gave me. I think I left my Solomon lightweight biking hat at the RPH shelter. Now that I feel like I needed it, I searched through my entire backpack looking for it to no avail. As a last resort to keep my bald head covered, I used the cravat from my first aid kit and doused it with water. Much cooler now.
At mid afternoon tic check I found 2: got one crawling, the other biting. Reminder to self: Tomorrow, I'm going to wear the long legs to my hiking pants and tuck them into my socks. I'll have to do a more thorough tic check this evening, too.
Bed time here now. I arrived at the Telephone Pioneer's shelter about 5 pm. Met ""Ice Beard"" and later ""Snickers.” Helped a couple kids from NYC hang a bear bag.  Ice beard is an electrical engineer who has been doing short sections of the Appalachian Trail for years. He got his name from hiking on a cold day years ago north of Harpers Ferry when he had his beard actually ice up from the freezing of the moisture he was exhaling. Snickers is a Coast Guard boatswain's assistant. She is planning to go  back to school and is in between jobs.  She started hiking at Harpers Ferry on the 6th of April just five days after I did.  For dinner I ate rice/olives/pepperoni also ramen - both yummy.  No more tics.","RPH shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562417,"About 8:15 a.m. on the 30th of April. It looks like today is going to be another beautiful day - at least the beginning of it. I got up about 5:45 ,had a usual breakfast of homemade fortified oatmeal with ground nuts and a variety of raisin and dried berries. Eventually, I got under way back on the trail after treating some more water at the nearby stream at about 7 a.m. The early morning part of the trail was relatively easy. It was simply a descent down the Northeast end of West Mountain between the municipalities of Pawling NY and Wingdale NY. At the bottom of the hill the trail crossed a beautiful Wetlands on a very nicely constructed raised boardwalk.
Around the middle of the boardwalk through the wetland I met a gray-haired man wearing an old BDU (Battle Dress Uniform) style Army hat and jeans who was walking his dog. We chatted about thru-hiking and he said that he had completed the thru-hike in 1976. Evidently for most hikers he meets he explains that this was before they were born. Not so in my case. 
From there the trail went through a couple deep green grassy fields. I took a picture of an old wooden water tower standing in the middle of one of these fields and also one of a cow chip because it reminded me of home (upstate NY). Our neighbor kept cows in a field immediately adjacent to the property I lived on with my family before I went off to college. I also mentally noted that the stiles erected to enable hikers to cross over the farmers fences we're in fact in this case necessary. In Maryland and Pennsylvania similar stiles were probably once necessary, but by the time I hiked there, the fences next to them in some cases had been removed, so you didn't actually have to clean them. Today the stiles straddled the farmers' electric fence, so trying to negotiate that without the use of the stiles might have been uncomfortable!
Via text from Gandalf I learned that he and Flicker had finished up New Jersey and the first couple of days of New York which were the most difficult parts of the hike in New York State as I experienced it.
Sometime after 9 o'clock in the morning, while climbing the hill north of the pastures, I met southbound thru hiker Chris (no Trail name yet). She appeared to be college-aged and athletic, with healthy bright eyes and all smiles. She had gotten on the trail around the Massachusetts border and was just headed south. She said her plan was to see where life took her. We exchanged information about the sections of Trail we had just hiked and then we wished each other good luck and happy trails and then we continued on our way.
At about 11 o'clock, while I was taking a short water break, Snickers caught up to me northbound. Although she had left the shelter about an hour before I did this morning she had evidently gotten off the trail to eat breakfast at a deli. We hiked together and chatted for about a half an hour and then when we arrived at the Wiley shelter I stopped for lunch and she continued on. While I was eating lunch at the shelter, it started to rain and a couple of northbound day hikers (Larry and Marcy from just north of New York City) stopped in and joined me. We chatted for awhile and then they continued north while I stopped at the nearby stream to fill another liter of water. Then I noticed the sign saying that this water supply contains coliform bacteria, so filter or disinfect prior to consumption. I have treated it in order to disinfect it, but will reserve it for an emergency.  Now that I read that sign, I will filter it too before I consume it. More likely I'll end up dumping it out as soon as I find a better water supply. At about 12:30 I came to Fight Road and the New York/Connecticut border. I took a picture of the welcome sign. A couple hundred yards later, I found a cache of Trail magic!  I ate a candy bar and drank a Coke-Cola.  I also replaced my treated but previously contaminated water with pure bottled spring water.
Sometime between 1:30 and 2 pm I got up to Larry and Marcy just before we reached the Ten Mile River shelter. I stopped there for a snack and signed the logbook. Just north of there I came to the Net Anderson Memorial Bridge dedicated to the memory of the Sherman farmer and self-taught naturalist who, with the Sherman Boy Scouts and the enthusiastic help of many others, blazed and maintaind the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut between 1929 and 1948. I took a picture from the span of this bridge of the Confluence of the Ten Mile River and the Housatonic River.
Later in the afternoon I also took a picture from the ridgeline I have been hiking on. This is looking out over the area of Bulls Bridge and Litchfield Connecticut. I could see down across the Housatonic River and make out some vehicles driving on Kent Road which is US Route 7. I caught up with Snickers eventually and passed her near the top of what must be the south end of Schaghticoke Mountain. Later when I stopped to get water at about my mile 18 point, she was pulling off the trail then to set up camp for the night. I continued on to the Mount Algo shelter.
I arrived at the Mount Algo shelter at about 6:30 p.m. It had been a long day and about 21.2 miles. My feet were sore. The shelter is in a nice location above a stream and on relatively flat ground surrounded by widely spaced trees which make it a convenient location for camping as well. At the shelter I met 3 short-section hikers who had set up a tent and two hammock tarps. I also met a guy named Edward from Brooklyn. He's on disability and had some difficulty communicating, but he seemed like a nice guy and we talked about everything from politics to food. Speaking of food, for dinner I cooked the dehydrated chili ala her sister, Dorothy that Teresa had given me when we were in West Point. It was excellent. I also had a peanut butter tortilla and ramen.  It feels like it's going to be colder tonight. It is 8:10 p.m. almost bedtime.","Telephone Pioneer's Shelter
",Mount Algo Shelter,"Apr 30, Sun",21.20
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562547,"I got up this morning with the first sign of light, around 5 o'clock. That was about 20 minutes earlier than the birds for a change. I went through my normal unhurried early morning routine and was on the trail by 6:45. Edward woke about 6:30 and we chatted about the weather and he gave me information about what I should expect on today's hike. As I headed off northward towards Caleb's Peak, I recall things Edward had said about life in New York City and Brooklyn. He had confirmed what the two high school kids had told me the previous day, about availability of a $35 round trip train ticket from New York City to Pawling, NY. A good deal. Evidently popular too. Edward had also complained that the city of New York had become overrun with homeless people. Particularly noticeable is the terrible smell in public places like the subway system. He said the homeless people had nowhere else to do things like try to find a place to bathe. And that they even defecated on the Platforms in the train stations. It was unclear to me if he counted himself among these people. He had a nice backpack, a nice jacket and while he explained that he did not have a job and was on disability, I assumed that also meant he had a sort of regular source of disability income and that he was in fact not homeless. But at one point he did share with me that he had been surprised that out here in the woods you didn't get it as smelly as quickly has in the city. He said he'd been hiking for 4 days and that he knew he needed a shower, but in the city it would only take him one day to get really smelly. After this conversation, I checked myself and came to the conclusion that I was overdue a shower, but not egregiously so.  My plan remains to try to take care of that tomorrow evening when I get off the trail in Salisbury.
This morning the weather had been cold and overcast, but the forecast was for partly sunny skies with a high of 70, so I stashed my jacket inside the trash compactor bag with which I line the interior of my backpack and I headed out. I would soon be too hot to hike with my jacket, but it was too cold to stand around without it.
I reached the summit of Caleb's Peak shortly after 9 a.m. and I took a picture, but there was not much of a view today with sky completely overcast, low hanging clouds, and a light drizzle going on.
Fortunately the rain didn't last very long and the cloud cover kept it cooler has the day warmed up. Somewhere mid-morning I spent some time negotiating descending St. John's ledges. This was a pretty long, steep section with down steps that required me to extend to the limit of my range of motion. In several places I had to pause to decide whether to face toward or away from the mountain in order to get the next foot landing. It seems to me that this took a while, but I also keep in mind that it's really only a warm-up for what's going to come further north in New England. After completing that descent, I was rewarded with a 4 mile stretch of relatively flat ground along the West Bank of the Housatonic River
Well, maybe it was more like 6 miles. And then to make the afternoon interesting, the trail would go up and down 5 relatively significant hills. I guess instead of one 3500 foot climb, five 700 foot climbs and descents, get you the same work out if not the same views. Looking at the terrain profile in my guidebook I could see there were actually 6 bumps, but one deemed too small to count. After climbing the first of these, I came to a sign warning that an upcoming stream could be dry in the event of hot weather. The sign mentioned a bypass that I couldn't locate, so I want ahead to look at the stream and I found it to be not much bigger than the Little Chazy River that runs behind the upstate NY house I grew up in. I decided to just go right across it. I figured that it wasn't deep enough to be dangerous. Even if I did fall in, it was only shin deep at the deepest spots. I did not fall in. While navigating the second hill of the day, I decided on a mind game of naming the five terrain features I had to overcome today after days of the week making this one ""Tuesday"" and the biggest one ""Wednesday"". After finishing ""Tuesday,"" I hiked the little hill I had previously deemed too small to count, and I decided that it was worthy of attention somehow,  so I called it ""Tuesday evening."" Wednesday was challenging enough for me to think of it as the actual hump day of this afternoon. There was a pretty good view to the southwest from the top of Wednesday, so I took a picture. I also drank some water, but I figured it was not sufficient to offset the amount of sweating I've been doing from the climbs I was going to have to do this afternoon, so I made a mental note to guzzle and pick up some more water at the next opportunity.
So at the bottom of ""Wednesday"" I did in fact pick up some more water. The climbs up ""Thursday"" and ""Friday"" were strenuous but manageable. Halfway up ""Friday"" I came to feature known as Split Boulder. It reminded me of the lemon squeezer in New York, only this one was easier because there was plenty of room to wear your pack going through the narrow crevice.
I arrived at the Pine Swamp shelter shortly after 5 p.m. and I had it all to myself. I was hot and sweaty, so my immediate priorities were first to get out of my hiking boots and into my Crocs and then to find the nearby water source. About 200 yards downhill beyond the shelter, I came to a beautiful stream where I was able to fill three liters of water for my evening and morning requirements. I also was able to stand in the middle of the stream a little more than ankle deep and wash my sweaty clothing and my sweaty self. I figured turnabout is fair play for the beavers downstream haha. I say that because there was a local map of the site which indicated that the water source feeds into a beaver pond which is the reverse of the situation I had the other day where I was concerned about the water coming out of a Beaver Pond being potable. After hiking back up the hill with my water to the shelter, I dried off and reapplied insect repellent and became a different kind of smelly again.
I made tomato soup and a peanut butter tortilla for dinner. That wasn't sufficient to satisfy my hunger, so I made another peanut butter tortilla but this time added my last tuna packet. The tuna peanut butter tortilla was fantastic especially when chased with swigs of the tomato soup.
I then reviewed my hiking plan for the next several days and annotated the the pages extracted from the hiking guide with my plan so that I can carry it in my cargo pocket. I also explored the site and nearby and found the privy, camping sites, an actual wash site for cleaning dishes and a bear box. I saw that in the shelter there was a sign that began, ""NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE."" Black bears have been seen in the area of the Pine Swamp shelter and campsites. Use the bear box for storage of food and other strong smelling items (ie toothpaste, soap and deodorant) and someone had written in, thru-hikers. And the final warning on the notice was a fed bear becomes a dangerous bear. Signed Connecticut Chapter Appalachian Mountain Club. So I complied and put all my aromatic stuff in an airtight food bag and stored that and the bear box. Hopefully no such visitors tonight.","Mount Algo Shelter
",Pine Swamp Shelter,"May 01, Mon",17.30
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562699,"No Bears last night. But I didn't get all that much sleep either. Pine Swamp shelter has a tin roof and evidently is the nighttime playground of the squirrels and chipmunks on this hilltop! So between their scampering and the drumming sound of rain every 30 minutes throughout the night, I was awakened frequently. Finally at about 5 a.m. I decided to spend some time refining my hiking plan for the next legs of this journey. I studied the locations and services available at several of the upcoming towns where I might need to stop for resupply. This would include today's stop at Salisbury, Connecticut as well as potential stops at Great Barrington Massachusetts in a couple of days, Becket, Dalton or Cheshire, Mass after that and potentially North Adams, Mass as well enroute to Bennington, Vermont. Interestingly it still looks like I should arrive in Bennington around the 9th or 10th of May as originally planned. That is about 3 days before Jenna’s graduation (Associates degree from a 2-year college) in Putney, Vermont,  so I will have effectively walked to her graduation from Maryland. I'm also looking forward to hitting the 500-mile mark on Thursday or Friday.
For breakfast this morning I had the last of my peanut butter and a pack of Gatorade chews as well as one Clif bar and two cups of coffee. My food bag is now completely empty except for one instant coffee packet and the trash from all the food items I've consumed since leaving West Point. I saved two Clif bars to put in the waistband pocket of my backpack for snack and lunch today while I'm on the way to Salisbury.

While finishing my coffee I packed my stuff and made my first journal entry for the day. I was done with all that and ready to hit the trail about 6:30 a.m.

I left a Pine Swamp shelter and headed north past the Sharon Mountain campsite and probably around 8:30 arrived at what the guidebook calls the Sharon Mountain hang gliders view. I took a picture from here of the view out to the north-northwest. The high today was at Point Pleasant where the forest was damp and lush with a multitude of shades of green. In addition to the rhododendrons, which have been along the trail ever since I started it in Maryland and the ubiquitous oaks, today's forest has a scent of pine and the combination of oak leaves and pine needles covering the path makes it softer. So whereas yesterday I had noted the damp, musty smell of the riverbank, today the pine smell reminded me of hiking and walking in the woods as a child. While the forest was peaceful, it was not quiet. There were a multitude of birds communicating with one another. I wish I could identify them. Some of the calls I recognize and have been hearing ever since I started the trail, but some of them are new. Despite the fact that it had been raining on and off last night and the ground was damp and the rocks slippery, the climbing wasn't too bad and the walk all in all was very pleasant.
At about 9:30 I came to the intersection of US Highway 7 and CT 112. Crossing the roads, the trail briefly circumnavigated a grassy field and went north along the west bank of the Housatonic River. It then parallelled CT 112 to the west and crossed over the Housatonic River on a modern bridge. Then bearing north, it went through the edge of the small town of Falls Village. Well inside the limits of the town, I passed one day hiker and three short section hikers who had taken a shuttle to get on the trail at the Massachusetts border and were hiking south to Pawling, New York.
The trail then went along the northeast bank of the river and by the Falls Village hydroelectric plant. As described in the guidebook, there was an electrical outlet on the outside of the building at the plant. I stopped for about 30 minutes and took a break and charged my phone.
While on my break I heard from Sneakers that she had done 24 miles yesterday and intended to do 20 today to make it to the Massachusetts border. I was impressed. For a moment my inner overachiever had my attention and suggested that maybe I could do that too. It's only five miles more than I was planning to do today. But then my mind quieted again and I hiked my hike. The trail then went back across an iron bridge to the west bank and I had several points at which I had a nice view of the actual falls for which the village is named. I took a picture of one of these.
Continuing northbound, I passed features described in the guidebook is Giant's Thumb and Eric's View. I took a picture at the latter.  Continuing, I arrived at the outskirts of Salisbury Connecticut at about 2 p.m. and I hiked the half mile into town to the post office where I retrieved the package Teresa had mailed me. I had tried to call to hostels to see if I could find a place to stay in this town, but hadn't had an answer, so I was on Main Street looking for a restaurant where I could have a meal, relax and repackage my food bag. Then I got a call back Maria McCabe with whom I'd left a message earlier. She confirmed that she had room available, so I walked up to her house another quarter mile.  $35 covers a good bed, breakfast, shower, a ride to the laundromat, soap for the laundry machine and picture with Maria, age 87. I also met Running Bear and Jag Happy, two hikers who we're already at Maria's house. After taking a shower, Maria gave me a ride to the laundromat where I did laundry and repackaged my food bag. Then I went back to her house, updated my trail journal and prepared to go to dinner with the other hikers.
We had dinner at the Inn across the street. I had a burger with fries and a Caesar salad with chicken. I also learned that jag happy is retired from his own practice as a personal injury attorney in San Francisco. He is also a cancer survivor. Since his retirement he has given away most of his personal possessions and he lives on a futon in his son's apartment in San Francisco when he is there. He does not know what he will do when his hike is over but he seemed optimistic about the future and looks forward to an opportunity to contribute to political activism. I also learned that Running Bear is a teacher and coach from Waycross Georgia. He's very familiar with the area around Fort Stewart where I lived from 2002 to 2004. Between the years 1987 and 2000 and 7 Running Bear completed the entire AT in a series of section hikes. Evidently he got hooked and he was hiking again. After dinner we went back to Maria's House chatted for a little while took some pictures and Brie and make sure that she got a hug from each of us before we all said goodnight. I was in bed by 8 p.m. Hiker midnight.","Pine Swamp Shelter
","Salisbury, CT","May 02, Tue",15.60
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562811,"This morning I got up around 5:30 and made breakfast in Maria's kitchen according to her instructions. She had said we could have eggs, toast, orange juice, bananas, etc. but we had to cook ourselves because she didn't get up until 9 o'clock. I enjoyed chatting with Jag Happy over breakfast and afterwards I signed Maria's log book thanking her for her hospitality and kindness. I was on the way back to the trail shortly after 7 and on the trail Itself by 7:30. It's not always obvious how the trail meshes with the streets and roads in towns. I walked an extra half mile or so finding its actual path as had also been the case two other times: when I left Boiling Springs, PA and when I had arrived in Bear Mountain State Park, NY.
At about 8:30, while hiking on a beautiful section of the AT north of Bunker Hill, still in Connecticut, I met southbound section hiker Jeff. He doesn't have a trail name yet. He had stayed at the riga shelter last night and said it was a a beautiful morning from up there. And that he planned to stay at the filters Shelter tonight. I remember passing that yesterday, though I did not stop there to sign the log book just for the sake of it as I sometimes have done. Jeff and I talked about hiking and I asked him about the shoes he was wearing. I explained these were my second set of Oboz and that the first had basically fallen apart already and REI promised to refund them. I said I like the way the boots felt generally speaking but that I still have sore feet at the end of every day.  Most of the over-50 hikers I've met say the same and that's just part of the deal. Jeff was wearing a pair of ankle-high LA Sportiva shoes. Not quite boots but not quite Trail Runners either. He said he had replaced the cinch-up lacing system that came with them with regular laces after he found that the original laces didn't stay tight during an entire day of hiking. He said he had also gotten them at REI. We wished each other have a good day and good luck on our hikes and moved on.
A short while later I met southbound section hiker Joe. At first I mistook him for a trail maintainer because of his  Appalachian Trail hat  and the hiking clothes he was wearing looked like a uniform. He said no he was just Joe from New Jersey. He had been hiking from Great Barrington to Hoyt Road at the CT-NY border. This would extend for him the section of the AT that he had been working on for some time-  from Northern Virginia through the CT-MA border. Basically, he's hiking the same section of the trail that I've hiked this year. We talked about a Trail name he explained that he had never been on the trail long enough to get one. As a warning about the trail ahead, he told me that the hike down the north side of the Connecticut Bear Mountain would be difficult. It had been very hard for him going up. At one point he had temporarily become disoriented and had to climb a very steep section at which point after almost knocking himself off the mountain with his backpack. So he took off his pack and climbed 10 yards or so and used his bear bag line to pull his backpack up to his new location. Having sighted a northbound hiker coming down, he watched which way she went for a while and told her she was a special kind of Trail Angel letting him know which way the course went. He discovered that the part he had just finished was in fact a place where he had gone right when the trail had gone left and he had essentially missed a switchback and climbed up the steep, rocky section between two graded portions of the trail. In talking about this with him, I figured out that the hiker he had watched coming down was Snickers.  Momentarily the big forest again felt like a small world. I also asked Joe about the Spot emergency communications beaconing device he was wearing. He said that it had excellent battery life and that it was very comforting for his family members while he was solo hiking. As we wished each other good luck and told each other to be safe and enjoy the trail, he bid me farewell as GI Joe. I did the same calling him Joe from New Jersey and he laughed and said yes GI Joe and Jersey Joe haha.
A short while later, after a brief climb I reached the Lion's Head and took some photos of an amazing view to the east. A little while later I reached the Riga shelter. There I found three chaperones and a group of about 30 High School kids. I introduced myself to a guy in hiking pants and a blue sweatshirt with a logo reading ""Leaders"" and a woman wearing a NY Yankees hat. They explained that they were from the Leaders School in Brooklyn and they had the kids out to try to get them the hiking bug. They also warned me what shelter they were heading to on the other side of Race Mountain and that they would likely be loud and disturbing to other campers there. I wished them a good day, happy hike and I went up to the Riga shelter where I signed the register and had a snack and the remainder of half a bag of gorp I had started that morning.
Sometime after 10 o'clock I reached Bear Mountain Road, which in my book is a sort of demarcation between the Lion's Head terrain feature to the South and the highest point in Connecticut, Bear Mountain itself to the north. Climbing slowly, it took me about an hour but eventually I got to the top of Bear Mountain itself. I took some pictures of The Rock Tower Monument and I climbed to the very highest point to take pictures of the land to the east - some really amazing views. On my way up Bear Mountain, I was reminded of several places I've been in the Adirondacks and places where I've skied in Vermont such as Smugglers Notch. Places that seem to want to be but aren't quite above the treeline.  It seems the only things growing are short bushes and bent and twisted evergreens that grow only in the direction the weather and prevailing winds allow. I'm sure in the winter, with snow and ice weighing them down, the wind breaks off any branches trying to violate this direction. Bear Mountain at 2314 feet or so is not so high as far as mountains go, but it is the biggest thing around and it feels pretty cool to stand on top of it.
I carefully descended the north side of Bear Mountain, CT and took a picture of one of the steeper sections, thinking the degree of difficulty was overstated by the hikers I had seen here earlier today and yesterday. Not that it wasn't difficult - at one time I took hold of a rock or a tree to step down backwards and then maneuver 180 degrees in order to face forward and continue. I never felt unsafe and I really don't think it was as difficult as the descent some section hikers called Agonies Grind back in New York or New Jersey I can't remember. The descent down Bear Mountain was also not as long as I anticipated, and fairly soon I was walking through a section known as Sage's Ravine. This was absolutely beautiful steep slopes on both sides of a mountain stream flowing over several sets of falls forming natural swimming holes in several locations. Had I not stayed in Salisbury yesterday or if it had been later in summer and hotter out, I certainly would have stopped to go for a swim. The Sage's Ravine section of the trail actually runs from west to east and then turns north. After it turns north across is the Little River, there's a sign that says Welcome to Massachusetts. I took a picture of that but I also noted the guidebook indicates that this sign is misplaced - that I had crossed the actual CT-MA border on the AT a mile or so earlier. I then begin the ascent of Race Mountain which hed several beautiful views off to the east like I had seen earlier today from Bear Mountain. I also passed several southbound day hikers on this half mile section of the trail enroute to the top.
As I mentioned before, the difficulty of the Bear Mountain descent has probably been overstated. However, what surprises me is that no one had even mentioned the ascent of Grace Mountain and its exposed eastern side. This was about a half mile of trail on the rocky edge of a very steep drop (almost a cliff) several hundred feet high. Due to the absence of vegetation on the rocks, you could see a great distance over an arc of more than 180 degrees. I took several pictures here. During the descent of the north side of Race Mountain, I learned another lesson about the hazard of slipperiness. Rocks were dry since it had been maybe 24 hours since any significant rain had fallen. However, as there had been a significant quantity of it yesterday, some rain water still lingered, pooled and and puddled between the rocks and on the trail. It was impossible to walk without occasionally stepping in some of these shallow muddy puddles and subsequently having wet boots. While I knew to tread more cautiously over wet rocks, today I experienced how wet boots on dry rocks pose a significant hazard, too.  Mine had become wet enough to reduce their traction on what would have otherwise been a good rock surface. At the bottom of a short section of downhill climb as I stepped on the bottom edge of the bottom rock, my right foot slipped away and I fell backwards and caught myself with my right hand. My hand struck a rough exposed pine tree root and I got a minor scrape and bruise on my right wrist. Nothing to really worry about, but surprising enough to remind me to be a little more cautious.
Sometime between 2:30 and 3 p.m. I got to the bottom of Race Mountain and the Race Brook Falls campsite. I realized that since it had been relatively cold and windy today, there had been a complete lack of insects and I hadn't needed to use insect repellent at all. I also had not felt anywhere near as hot and sweaty as I had on previous days, but nevertheless, I'd not been drinking enough water so I downed the remainder of a liter water bottle and refilled it from the stream and treated it with aquamira and then I moved on.
It was now time to climb Mount Everett. This would be an approximately one mile section of trail going from 800 to about 2600 foot elevation. That makes it taller than Bear Mountain which I had climbed this morning, the highest peak in Connecticut. The first several hundred meters of the climb were a relatively easy scramble up a slanted piece of granite which then evolved into a few hundred meters' climb on broken chunks of granite and other metamorphic rocks. That continued to be the trend for the remainder of the trail to the top of Mount Everett. It didn't take long and I reached the peak about 3:30. I think this was due to the fact that although steep, the trail is relatively straight and therefore shorter.  It's evidently not steep enough to require switchbacks because there weren't any. I took another picture from the top of Mount Everett. Looking out over the valley I could see the moving shadows of the mostly cloudy sky.
Somewhere near the top of Mount Everett I saw a small Red-headed Woodpecker and took a picture.  Not long after that I finally actually spotted one of the birds whose call I had been hearing the entire hike - a sort of two toned whistle like 'wheee, whoooo.' It was a little bird about the size of a canary, white with a black head and some other colors on it that I didn't make out before it flew away and before I could get a picture. Now I realize that it was the third bird I had seen today, after just yesterday commenting on the fact that I had heard so many but had not seen them. So, I'm going to go back and re-title today's journal entry ""this is for the birds."" Haha.
While climbing down Mount Everett I realized my fingers were starting to get numb so I decided it was probably about time to put my shirt back on! Haha. I had been hiking without it to try to get some of the ""partly sunny"" on my shoulders to make up for the elbow level tan I'd been getting out here. Shortly thereafter I also decided it was time to put my Gore-Tex on. With the windchill probably in the thirties, it was just a little too chilly for tanning even for someone raised in the North country.
Sometime after 4 I saw a sign for the Glen Brook shelter and realized I must have already passed the Hemlocks shelter, the destination I'd set out to reach this morning. But looking at my terrain profile in the guidebook,  there was nothing more significant than a couple of 200 foot climbs between there and Great Barrington. So I decided just to continue walking as long as my feet felt good. Which they did. Probably because for most of the day today I have just been going pretty slowly and taking it easy on them. So I'll change the destination for today's destination.
Well, in addition to the couple of 200 foot climbs, there was also the descent of Mount Bushnell which I had evidently walked onto when proceeding north from the base of Mount Everett. Mount Bushnell was another long ridgeline and I took pictures at a couple of different spots with a view to the east-northeast. The climb down was about 1,000 feet and in my opinion more difficult than the climb down the rorth end of Bear Mountain earlier today. When I got to the bottom the trail went basically horizontal for about four and a half miles through forests and Farmer's fields until crossing over Route 41 and eventually US 7. Along the way it passes the monument to the Shays Rebellion of 1787 when several thousand protesters rose up against the government of Massachusetts. I put a greater explanation and excerpt from Wikipedia's article on this in the caption of the photo I took at that location. Route 7 is the same road across which and parallel to which I have been walking a couple days ago in Connecticut. While I was approaching Route 7, I called and made a reservation at the Days Inn in Great Barrington which is about 3 miles from the point at which the trail crosses Route 7. Original plan had been to go from Salisbury to the Hemlock Shelter which was less than 14 miles. But since I've been feeling pretty good this was relatively easily extended to over 20 miles. However, I thought that was far enough and for the feeling of accomplishment from today's hike and climbs, I was happy do a second night in a row in an actual bed and all that comes with that. 
So, at 8:13 pm I am waiting for my first Uber ride ever. Great Barrington, MA is not a large city, but it's big enough to have Uber and the driver I contacted by text should be here in 10 minutes.  Goodnight!","Salisbury, CT
","The Days Inn, Great Barrington, MA","May 03, Wed",21.30
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562981,"I had a nice stay at the Days Inn and a good dinner at the place down the street called The Well. Up at 5:30, I took my time getting packed and dressed and then went over to the office at the Days Inn to check out and have some breakfast. I talked to the manager Brian about hiking and outdoor adventure for some time and then caught a cab to make the three mile trip back to the trailhead. It actually wasn't until about 8:15 that I actually got on the trail. It was bright and sunny with a clear blue sky, but also cold and there was still some frost on the ground in places when I started hiking west toward the Housatonic River from Route 7 through the farmer's field. I crossed a footbridge over what appeared to be an irrigation canal, and on the far end of it I noticed the spray of a manure spreader with the fresh scent that it had brought to the field on that side of the canal. I actually enjoyed the sweet scent as it reminded me of home
In the cab on the way out from the Days Inn the driver and I talked about the weather, and he shared with me that he heard cool but good weather for this morning as the forecast but also really bad rain and storms hitting in late afternoon and evening, so he advised me to get hunkered down by then. I thanked him.

The trail turned right and once again paralleled the Housatonic River, this time headed south. Sometime around 8:30 the trail turned left and crossed to the east side of the Housatonic River on a concrete bridge built in 1963. Near the bridge on the banks of the river there was a posted sign warning people not to eat fish, frogs or other creatures from the river, because the river is contaminated with pcbs. After crossing the river, the trail continued east through small sections of forest separating several pastures. Then after crossing Boardman Street south of Great Barrington, the trail headed up the side of the first of the mornings' two initial climbs: June Mountain and East Mountain.

On the way up I met a southbound hiker going by the trail name Turk. He had actually started in Georgia and made it as far as Waynesboro, Virginia when he had to get off the trail to attend his grandmother's funeral. Then because he is from Massachusetts, he got back on the trail near the MA-VT border and headed south.  So, when he gets to Waynesboro he'll have to make his way back to Vermont to finish his hike. He hopes to make it through Katahdin by the 21st of July. He told me the names of different hikers who he had traveled with mostly during his initial northbound section. He also said that he had just passed Snickers earlier today headed north. He was also aware of Stamps and Silver Girl. He mentioned that a few days ago he had gone through a really wet section and gotten his feet completely soaked and that he had not expected rain and had been contending to just cowboy camp for the night and had all the stuff laid out when the sky opened up on him. Apparently he was near I-90 when that happened, so he just set up his rainfly on the bridge over I-90 and slept there. His feet had gotten really wet, so he thought his Merrell Trail Runners might be just a little bit too big and that he would try to adjust the size of the insoles he was putting in them. They looked really light and comfortable to me. And I have heard that having non waterproof shoes has a major advantage when it's hot and your feet are sweaty because they will breathe much better in that kind of footwear.  I snapped a picture of the two of us standing there on the trail and sent him a copy of it at his request.

Sometime around 10:15 or so I reached the top of June Mountain where there was a nice view from a rocky ledge where I could see out to the west. According to the guidebook, this was at mile 1523.8 northbound. Since I started at Harpers Ferry (1023.7 northbound), this point was just beyond my 500 Mile mark. I took a picture of the view out to the west and in the background I can make out Bear Mountain, Race Mountain, Mount Everett, and Mount Bushnell from left to right - the same peaks that I had climbed yesterday on the west side of Great Barrington.

The trail went south and followed the ridgeline opposite the one I had gone north on yesterday along a path that offers several points at which I could view the same peaks. Around 11 a.m. I heard a dog barking and then growling and a large brown dog with a very muscular jaw was standing in the path ahead of me. I could see that she had an orange collar, but I could not see her owner. I stopped and called out hello several times and got no answer. The dog barked several more times and growled a little and then I heard a voice call something indistinguishable. Once the dog turned, I advanced. I could tell the dog was uncomfortable with my presence, but also that it didn't really intend to attack, so I kept going. A few minutes later the dog climbed a steep rocky section and stopped next to a gentleman with close-cropped silver hair and no shirt sitting on top of the rock. As he saw me starting to climb the steep rock with a white blaze on it, he pointed out that the trail actually went around to the other side, so I rerouted. I then climbed off the trail up onto the rock where he was seated in order to take in the view to the south. I asked if he was hiking long-distance and he said no just out for the day escaping work. I could see that he had his shoes off and he was reading a local newspaper. He wasn't very talkative at first, but he eventually warmed up and smiled. He told me his daughter's name was Everett and I asked if she was named after the mountain I climbed yesterday and he said absolutely. When I asked if he had done a lot of hiking, he said he had hiked most of the Appalachian Trail at different points over the last 40 years. I asked if he had picked up a trail name in that time. At first he said, ""No,"" and then he seemed to remember and said, ""Well, a long time ago I was Suffering Bastard."" I took a couple of pictures and told him I would leave him to his nice piece of rock on this beautiful day and wished him a good day. He wished me likewise and I continued hiking. The trail then turned back to the northeast.

At about 12:30 I stopped for lunch at the Tom Leonard shelter, having a package of beef jerky and a couple of Pop -Tarts and signed the logbook. I took my time doing this and got back on the trail around 1:30 p.m.

Leaving the Tom Leonard shelter, I soon passed by a stunning crack in the ground 30 - 40 feet deep with the two sides separated by at least 20 feet. Numerous broken rocks are collected at the base of the two rock walls with moss growing on many of them, but the forest grew directly up to the edge on both sides and the Appalachian Trail went right along the south side until the crack ended and the trail was able to continue farther to the north. A while later I came to what I thought would be my next water source: a large stream flowing out of a bog. I decided to pass on this water, though after noting its brownish color and oily discoloration of the surface in places that where the water was standing still near an old dam.  Heading up the trail I passed picturesque farm off to the left and took a picture. 

North of Blue Hill Road, the trail rose for a bit and then came to another road where there was a sign marking the delineation of East Mountain State Park to the South and Beartown State Park to the north. I entered Beartown State Park on the trail. I soon came to Benedict Pond which was peaceful looking - I took a picture there. The stream feeding Benedict Pond was fed by a large bog which was shored up by a huge beaver dam and on the surface of the water in the bog I could see at least a half-dozen beaver lodges. So I thought maybe Beavertown would have been a better name than Beatown for this place.

The trail then climbed a section of the park depicted on my map as The Ledges and I could soon see why. As the trail continued northbound, it followed the edge of huge rock wall which sloped steeply off to the south. I took a picture at a section where the trail went across a rock so the lack of vegetation made it easier to view the terrain below.

After passing The Ledges, I found a water source I felt comfortable using, but I used the 2-step method of purification just to be sure: Sawyer squeeze filter followed by aquamira, considering the beavers I had seen before. Around 4:30, I came to the Mount Wilcox South shelter and kept going. About 5:15 I came to the Mount Wilcox North shelter which had been my intended destination for today but I didn't feel like stopping so I kept going.

When I had been at Benedict Pond earlier today, I made a joking note for my trail journal that instead of Beartown State Park it could be Beaver Town. Later between the South and North Mount Wilcox shelters I spotted another pond in which there were actually three layers of beaver dams and many beaver lodges. The construction here was even more elaborate than at the previous Beavertown. I took a picture of the pond and also one of the large trees a beaver had cut down. Then I thought that if the other one was Beaver Town then this is Beaver City and collectively the park becomes Beaver Land. Haha

Well, it’s 6:30 pm and I just came out of a no coverage area and I have had my adrenaline fix for the day. I take back what I said before about renaming the park to Beaver Town. Bear Town is apt!  Here’s the story.

I was walking up the trail at about mile marker 1536.9 when I heard the sound of cracking branches and bark falling from a tree. I stopped. A shadowy shape slid down a tree about 30 to 40 yards off to my right front. It landed and then sat down near a log and turned and looked at me. It was obviously a black bear. It felt like longer, but it must have been five six seconds that time seemed to stand still, as the bear sat there. From the size of it, I didn’t think it was an adult bear. I'm not really sure because of the distance, but I think it was probably smaller than me,  maybe around a 150 pounds, but that's just a guess. I considered turning around and going back the way I had come, but thinking that this may be a cub whose mother may soon be looking, and not knowing where she may be, I just stayed where I was. As I had read in the “bear facts” guide I picked up at a State Park HQ in NJ, I raised both arms overhead to make myself appear larger and I whacked my trekking poles together to make noise hoping that this would scare the bear. It appeared to work, for the bear turned and ran off into nearby bushes and stayed there. I still wasn't sure what to do because it hadn't really left the area and I still had not  seen what I thought would qualify as an adult. Then came more scratching, branch cracking and another shadowy figure slid down from the tree, paused at the bottom by the log without looking at me. As the first bear had quickly gone away at the noise of my trekking poles, I had not had an opportunity to take a picture, so I reached for my camera to try to capture this bear, but it  disappeared before I could get a shot.  So again I used trekking poles to make noise to see if it would get them to go further away. Instead, there was more scratching and cracking and a third shadowy black shape slid down the tree landed at the base of it and immediately ran in the direction of the others. More trekking pole whacking on my part and they all ran off together to the south-southwest through the bushes making a ruckus of branch snapping and brushing sounds as they went. The muzzle or mouth area of the first bear was lighter colored like skin while the rest of its body was covered with dark black hair. I did not see the same skin tone muzzle on the face of the second and third bears, which were obviously also smaller than the first. The last one was probably not much more than 50 pounds. I judged that going back where I’d come from would actually be more likely to put me closer to where they’d run off, so I continued up the trail. As I passed I took a picture of the tree the 3 bears had come down.

Then to my chagrin the trail bent to the right and headed right for the bushes that the bears had initially hidden in when they ran away from the tree. To my relief though, the trail then headed back to the left and away after it passed that area. So still thinking that absent an adult, the direction they had run off to was likely towards mom and as a precaution I went the other way and I continued made occasional trekking pole clicking sounds so as to not surprise anything! Whew.
In case I lose coverage again I chose not to stop at the Shaker campsite. I signed the log book and I noted that another hiker had mentioned seeing a black bear and two cubs in the vicinity of that campsite and chose not to stay there. So I signed the log book and noted where I had seen three bears. I think they're probably the same and I think the first one I saw, relatively larger than the following two, may have been a small adult. Maybe a young mother.

It’s 7:53 pm and I'm going to put away my phone and hike now using both hands for trekking poles.","The Days Inn, Great Barrington, MA

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563141,"I
should probably start by summarizing events that occurred after I stopped
recording journal notes last night. I had the encounter with the bear
family sometime after 6 p.m. and had intended to make camp at the Shakers
campsite, but that was less than 1.5 miles from where I had seen the
bears and I wanted more distance between them and me! When I got to the Shakers
campsite, I signed the log book and noted that another hiker had recorded
seeing a black bear and two cubs near that campsite and had decided to camp
somewhere else. That seemed like a smart move! I made a note in the log book about my
observation indicating the mile marker of the bears sighting and noted
that I, too was going to hike
on and camp somewhere further up the trail. It would be
getting dark soon, and there were no more shelters for another 18 miles and the only other designated campsite was almost
another ten miles away (Turk had told me he thought that's where Snickers had intended to stop).  So I set out hiking in the dark with an open mind and that it may be hard to find a campsite. 
I ended up hiking on until 2 a.m., over several terrain features and passing what were probably
several nice views, only I
couldn't see them for the dark.
I saw another porcupine and just like the last time I'd hiked in the dark, when the porcupine heard me coming it
scampered up a tree (photo). Earlier, around 9 p.m., I'd
stopped at a stream to change my socks and I took advantage of the opportunity
to bathe my feet in the frigid water. It felt good - like an ice
pack, and continuing on hiking with clean, dry feet/socks was a
treat.  Next were fields and wetlands and two small
mountains before the place where the natural area for the Upper
Goose Pond ended. I'd passed up the opportunity to hike a half-mile off the trail to the
campsite by The Goose Pond cabin because that half-mile was in the wrong
direction and I could see that the natural area would be ending in 7 tenths of
a mile in the right direction, so that's the course I chose. There was a trail register log
book in a box mounted on a tree there, so I signed it before hiking
another ten meters northbound where I set up camp.
I suspended my tarp between two trees rather than using my trekking poles, just
to make things quicker and simpler. No sooner then I had my tarp up, it
started raining. I set up my stuff under my tarp as usual and hung my food bag from a tree branch about 10 meters away. I've been
sending Teresa texts letting
her know where I was and I sent her a picture of the porcupine and a couple of
other shots I had taken in the evening. I hope she gets a chance to post those
to this trail journal as well.
I
must have fallen asleep pretty quickly and I slept really well for a short
period of time.  Up at around 5 a.m., I broke camp
and was ready to go in 30 minutes. I wanted to move on before any early morning
hikers might pass by.
So
I hiked down the hill and was surprised how quickly I came to the Appalachian
trails bridge over Interstate 90. I took a picture and mentally added I-90 to my running
list of Interstate crossings. On the far side of I-90 was the Jacob's
Ladder Road and turnoff for Berkshire Lakeside Lodge. I was a little
disappointed that there hadn't been some kind of Visitor Center at I-90. A cup
of coffee would have been really nice! It was fairly challenging
conditions this morning with rain and temperature
around 45. Ground was wet and rocks slippery.
Sometime
around 6:30 am, while crossing what might be a trail for all terrain vehicles, I saw an orange tent set up on the
far side of the trail that I think may have been where Snickers chose to camp last night. I didn't see any
signs of movement, so I hiked a
bit more and stopped at a stream to filter and treat a liter of water to carry
with me.
When it was time to put the aquamira into the water bottle, I accidentally tipped the cap too soon and spilled the treatment solution, so I had to start over. I mixed the part A and Part B again and started to wait my five minutes. That’s when I heard a sound behind me and looked up to see a hiker was crossing the river. When she looked up, I recognized that it was Snickers and I thought, man she broke Camp quickly!  And when she saw me she asked how I got in front of her? So I told her that I had seen her tent and I told her the story of seeing the bears and how that motivated me to avoid staying at the Shakers campsite so instead looked for the first possible camping location outside the natural area just to the side of I-90. I told her I had thought about staying at the campsite by the cabin at Upper Goose Pond, but that it had been a half-mile off the trail in the wrong direction and she said that is exactly what went through her mind and why she stayed where she did. Snickers said she's getting off the trail today for the weekend and her boyfriend is meeting her at a road crossing ahead where the guidebook says The Cookie Lady lives. I told her I'd also be getting off the trail next week when I get to Vermont and that I would be off the trail for several days so that I could go to my daughter's graduation and visit my parents in northern New York. We took a picture and she headed up the trail. I finished treating my fresh liter of water and then paused to update my notes for today's Trail Journal entry.


At about 7:30, as I was approaching the top of Becket Mountain and feeling hot and like I was running out of gas, I decided to stop. I removed my Patagonia thermal insulation layer and stored it inside the waterproof heavy trash compactor bag lining my backpack. Breakfast time. The dehydrated strawberries were fabulous.  I emptied a packet of instant coffee into my mouth and took a swig of water to rehydrate it, swirled it around in my mouth, swallowed and repeated. A package of spam on a tortilla wrap which was terrific. With a baggie of gorp, a Clif Bar and two candy bars in the exterior pockets of my backpack and my Gore-Tex jacket I was set for snacks later in the day. The spam wrap tasted like more, so I got out a second tortilla and made a peanut butter wrap with some Jif to go. Now I'm fuelled and ready to go!

I finished my breakfast sometime between 8:15 and 8:30 and headed up the trail. I’ve lost one of my two lightweight waterproof mittens and my hands were cold, so I alternated wearing the mitten on one hand at a time. When I got to the top of Becket Mountain I found an AT register log book box on a tree and I signed it with a comment like, “Absolutely miserable weather today and I love it! It doesn't get any better than this!"" 

Sometime prior to 9:30 I came to Finerty Pond. There was an eerie mist floating in a layer about 10 feet above the surface of the water blowing from right to left slowly. (photo)

Around noon I reached the October Mountain shelter, so I stopped and took a break to cook lunch: a bowl of hot oatmeal and some bullion soup along with some more dried strawberries and another packet of instant coffee. This made me feel warm, full and energized. I treated another liter of water from the nearby stream and then continued northbound. Eventually, I came to a gravel road onto which the trail turned and shortly thereafter intercepted with and crossed a paved highway. According to my guide book somewhere around there is where The Cookie Lady lives. I just continued northbound over a hill and noted that the road crossing was approximately my 10 mile point for the day. The trail here became very wet due to both the rain and because of what appears to be naturally wet conditions. In some areas there were raised walkways, but in other areas the trail itself had become a small river. (photo)  I also saw the dung of an animal I couldn't identify (photo). 
I kept hiking all afternoon, over a big hill or two, and through a lot of water. It kept raining, and the wind picked up, and it got colder.  By 4:30, I was basically running out of steam.  Fortunately, the planed stop for the day was close at this point, and I reached the Kay Wood shelter about 4:45. My priorities were: dry clothes, warm food, and protection from the elements.  I changed out of the wet rain gear, put on a dry t-shirt and Patagonia insulation layer, and was happy for dry smart wool socks and crocs. I laid out my mat and sleeping bag so I could get in it quickly if not warming up otherwise.  Then I boiled some water to make beans and rice and bouillon. After I was feeling dryer and warmer inside, I went to a nearby steam and got two liters of water. Then I made some hot potatoes with vegetables and olives (another yummy Teresa meal).  

At this shelter I met a new hiker, John.  He is just starting out hiking from MA to Asheville, NC. He was wearing jeans and a Boston Bruins jacket.  John was using only a fleece blanket and space blanket - no sleeping bag. He had wrapped his tarp around one of the bunks in the shelter to act as a wind screen.  Using rocks as anchors, I managed to do something similar with mine (photo). This served the dual purpose of drying it out after it had gotten wet last night.


John made a small cook fire and boiled some water for coffee. 

As it got dark,  I got into my sleeping bag behind my tarp wall (photo).  I texted with Teresa for a while before going to sleep. Goodnight!","Campsite Near Mile Marker 1548.8
",Kay Wood Shelter,"May 05, Fri",16.90
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563365,"The Kay Wood shelter setup of last night with the tarp hung for a windbreak turned out to be pretty comfortable. Right before I went to sleep, a third hiker showed up as John had predicted. This was Kevin, a retired Air Force Security Police Officer who had chosen to set up his tent at a campsite near the shelter.  Kevin had been in Dalton all day and had just now returned.  He commented on how everything was flooded and the trail itself was like a stream. After chatting for a while, Kevin headed back to his camp.  It was dark, so I never actually got to see him. It rained on and off all night long and it was chilly enough outside so that I needed to keep my 20 degree sleeping bag zipped completely up. 

In the morning I chose to “sleep in” a little bit and did not actually get up until it was light out (after 6:30). I heated water for coffee and nut-fortified oatmeal and also had a tuna tortilla wrap for breakfast. Then I went about packing up my stuff which was still pretty wet. I weighed my options about my next destination. Considering the weather, at the moment the rain appeared to have broken and remained cool.  A check of the weather forecast indicated it would likely stay that way through early afternoon, so I decided to hike on. I knew the town of Dalton was only 3 miles away, but I still had a preference to make it to Cheshire, MA and stay at the Saint Mary's Church which runs a hostel for hikers. I also had planned to stop at the post office in Cheshire where another mail drop package from Teresa was waiting. However, knowing the post office hours were from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. I deliberately chose not to try to get up and start hiking at 5 a.m. in order to be there before closing. So I figured I would give the post office a call and request they forward my mail to another town further up the trail. That way I wouldn't have to wait around in Cheshire until Monday morning to get my package. 

During the entire breakfast and packing process, I had been chatting with John and we exchanged information about hiking gear and weather forecasts and so on. I learned that he is actually from Massachusetts but intends to settle in Asheville, NC. Having recently finished a contracting job in the Boston area as a mechanical engineer, John is now hiking to Asheville. He had just gotten on the trail from Dalton the day before yesterday and he said it took him all day to hike the three miles up the hill from Dalton to the Kay Wood shelter where we were. He said he’d done a lot of hiking around home with his best friend for distances of 6 to 12 miles, but not with a 50-pound pack. He was finding that significantly different. So when I was packed and ready to go, I bid John farewell and good luck with his hike and asked him to say Hi to Kevin and then I headed up the trail. 
 
After Grange Hall Road I came upon Barton Brook with a footbridge crossing it. This was actually the confluence of two small streams but with all of the rain they were both significantly swollen (photo). 
At about 9 o'clock I called the post office in Cheshire Mass and they confirmed that they did have the package Teresa sent me. I explained that I would not be able to arrive before they closed today and they offered to deliver the package to the Saint Mary of Assumption Church where had intended to stay. As there was no phone number for the church in my guidebook, I asked Google, and I called the number that it gave me. I got an answering machine recording from the church and left a message explaining that I didn't want the delivery of my package to be a surprise to them and I left my name and number. 
 
It was about 9:30 when I met southbound hiker Sherene who had delayed her start from yesterday due to the weather and was headed south to Great Barrington, MA.  
Following Massachusetts, she planned to hike most of the AT in Vermont  Sherene is a graduate student and wanted to do some hiking but was not yet ready to hike the whole AT. I first noticed that her eyes were gray and then that they matched her gray shirt, gray hiking pants and grey hat with the OR Logo of the Outdoor Research hiking gear company. Her trekking poles were a sort of burgundy red as was her backpack.  Anyway, I thought it all looks very good together and would give Sherene the best dressed hiker award if there was such a thing. Haha. She said she does not have a trail name yet and I explained that I would be taking a week off in Vermont and that by then she could be done with Massachusetts and it's possible we could run into each other again up there and that maybe by then she would have a trail name. She laughed and smiled. So we wished each other good hiking and she said, “I'll see you again in Vermont” as she headed off toward October Mountain shelter where I had lunch yesterday. 
 
By 10 o'clock I noticed that my Gore-Tex jacket was drying out fairly well, as were my Gore-Tex rain pants. I had put my regular hiking pants and my Patagonia insulation jacket inside the trash compactor bag to ensure they would stay dry in case it rains again today. As a consequence, I had only wet clothing to wear when I got dressed this morning. Since it wasn’t presently raining, movement should help warm and dry those clothes. I took off my Gore-Tex jacket and used its arms to tie onto my backpack so that it could continue to dry, and I hiked wearing my wet long sleeved blue base layer shirt which I knew would dry quickly. I also put away my wool cold weather hat and put on the green cravat I have been using as a head covering since losing my regular hat. It was soaked, but by 10:30 the sun started to come out and it, too dried quickly.
About 10:45 I entered the town of Dalton, MA, walked down a residential street, turned left on Main Street, and crossed a bridge over the Housatonic River once again. I stopped at the Juice & Java Coffee Shop to charge my phone and get coffee, a toasted wheat bagel with peanut butter and something called a whoopie pie. I made one more stop at a gas station convenience store for headlamp back-up Triple-A batteries, two large Snickers bars, 3 Clif bars and a pastry which looks remarkably similar to the whoopie pie I had at Juice & Java.


After leaving Juice & Java, I met a hiker with trail name Dr John. We walked together as the trail continued on a couple more streets through the town of Dalton, MA. And then the trail reentered the wood line and we hiked together until we reached the location where Dr. John intended to camp for the night. That was the Crystal Mountain campsite a little bit closer to Cheshire, MA than Dalton. Dr. John is a theoretical geophysicist which he explained is essentially the physics of plate tectonics. He has hiked the entirety of the Appalachian Trail a couple of times before. He did a thru-hike in 2004 and completed it in sections in 2007. As we climbed most of Crystal Mountain enroute to his camp, we discussed all sorts of things including politics, religion and civics. This made the time fly and before I knew it we were there and I was more than halfway between Dalton and Cheshire, my destination for the day. Dr. John had carried some beer with him from Dalton so when he offered I accepted and we stopped where the side Trail branched on blue blazes to go to his campsite and we drank a beer and took a picture together. When I asked if he would mind if I did that, he said, “not at all,” and from his perspective the photos with other hikers are more important than all the pictures of the scenery one gets during a thru-hike. He said after a while all the landscapes start to look alike but it's all the different people that you will want to remember. So we bid each other good luck and I continued on. 

Soon I passed yet another beaver pond called Gore Pond. Next was the summit of Crystal Mountain. At some point, while I was hiking with Dr. John, the sun had come out and it turned into a very nice day. I listened to a voicemail from father Matthew at the Saint Mary's of the Assumption Church confirming that he had my mail package, and he gave me details for staying at the parish. I called him back and left a message indicating that I had gotten his message and I thanked him.
At about 4 o'clock, on the other side of Mount Crystal, I came to Cheshire Cobble, from which there was a beautiful view of the town of Cheshire and the Reservoir with the same name (photo).  At that location I also met a couple and their dog named Brady. When I asked, “Like The Brady Bunch?” the guy, whose name was Murray, looked at me like I must be from Mars and said, “No, like Tom Brady.” He was from Clifton Park, NY and I told him that I had been there when I was in high school. The woman was named Shirley and she is from Cheshire. She asked if I was staying at Saint Mary's and when I said, “Yes,” she encouraged me to go to the spaghetti dinner that they would be having tonight. She said that she had gone to college in Linden, VT up in the northeast corner of the state. And when I told her I had been born in Newport and lived in Derby, VT which is also up near the Canadian border, she immediately knew where that was. Small world. I took a landscape photo where the highest peak in Massachusetts is visible: Mount Greylock which I should be getting to climb sometime in the next day or two. And I took another photo of the Brady family (at least that's what I will call them) with Cheshire Reservoir in the background. We then said good day and goodbye and when I continued hiking I discovered that I had accidentally taken a blue-blazed trail to get to the actual Cheshire Cobble so I returned to the main trail and continued down the mountainside toward the town.

A Saint Mary's I got my package, paid $10 entrance fee and partook in the spaghetti dinner as Shirley suggested.  I also purchased $10 in raffle tickets which I used to take a chance on some maple syrup and maple sugar treats. During the dinner, I spoke to a couple who have properties near the trail and I gave them my claim ticket and wished them good luck. I talked to several other people; I think the whole town was there! This was a fundraiser to help a local woman who has been battling cancer. I talked with her, her mother and sister after dinner. I also got to meet Father Matthew and thank him in person, as well as Michelle, who actually runs the parish hall.  After the dinner, while the fire department and other volunteers were cleaning the hall until about 9 pm, I updated my hike plan, and spoke with two other hikers, Gas Tank and Jolly Roger (He and she).  After we got to the rooms in the hall designated for hikers, I repacked my food bag, laid out some stuff to dry, washed up, took care of my feet, and then went to bed. Goodnight
NOTE: I've completed 1/4th of the AT!","Kay Wood Shelter
",Saint Mary's Church Hostel,"May 06, Sat",11.80
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563569,"Up by 5 am, I was quiet so as not to wake the other 2 hikers in the hostel.  After making a donation to St. Mary’s, I headed out and was on the trail by 7:15. The AT continued out of town on a residential road called Schorl Street, and crossed fields and up into the hills on the way to Mount Greylock. By mountain standards, this is not a big one, but the climbing will now start to become perhaps more significant than the distance in my hikes.  Today I'll be going up to 3490 feet and in a couple days climbing Stratton Mountain which is over 3900 feet. Story is that Stratton is the place that inspired Benton McKay to propose the creation of the Appalachian Trail nearly 100 years ago.
As it was cold when starting out, maybe 35 degrees, I hiked in Gore-Tex jacket to block the wind. But with the intermittent sun and the rigor of the climb, I soon warmed enough to take it off. On the climb, I enjoyed the sounds of a variety of birds and a family in the background and about 8:30 I could make out music which must be drifting up from mass at the St Mary's Church in the village below.
Sometime after 9 a.m. I met four southbound hikers. There were 3 gentlemen in their 60s and a young man in his 30s plus a fifth hiker if you count Seco, their dog. The elder hiker was Gandalf the Grey. He appeared to be the most experienced hiker among them, but I didn't have the heart to tell him that his trail name was already taken. The youngest’s name was Greg and when we were all talking about hometowns and hiking experiences, I mentioned that I grew up north of Plattsburgh, NY which he’d heard of.  He’s a college soccer coach at the University of Southern Vermont in Bennington. I told him that the high school in the town I had grown up in has a fantastic soccer record over the last 15 years in particular.  Repeated NY State champs in their division. He seemed interested in more detail, and when he asked me to spell the name of the school (Chazy), I think I could see his inner talent scout working. After we wished each other well and parted ways, I checked my guthook app, to see how I was doing. I had gone about three and a half miles in 2 hours and that included about a 1200 foot climb. Being now at about 2200 feet elevation, my pace validated the estimated schedule where I factored an additional 30 minutes of travel time for every thousand feet of climb.
At about 10:30 I stopped at the Mark Noeple shelter for a snack. I signed the shelter's logbook and noticed that a hiker who had been there on the 17th of April commented that there was still snow on the ground. 
Reaching the top of Greylock Mountain about 12:15, I spent some time walking around looking at the Bascom Lodge and the Massachusetts War Memorial which was constructed at the summit of the State’s tallest peak. I also took some time to read the memorial documentation on several plaques around the site. Particularly interesting was a one describing the marks of the ice age. One caption read: stretched across the shift bedrock on the summit, glacial striations record the advance of ancient glaciers from northwest to southeast.  The hard schist of Greylock summit was far too tough to be scarred more deeply, even by the huge force of ice glaciers. It also has a picture depicting an artist’s conception of 4000 feet of ice on top of the mountain. It had started raining intermittently about an hour before I got to the summit, but after I had been there for a while it started raining in earnest and the strong wind made the 45 degree temperature feel a lot colder. So I moved on.
I stopped in the Thunderbolt Ski Lodge which was built in 1930s when there was an active competitive ski slope here. Inside I saw a plaque with the 10th Mountain Division crest saying that the shelter was dedicated to a promising young skier who was part of the 10th Mt Div ski troop.  He was killed in World War II in the Apennine Mountains of Northern Italy on April 17th 1945. I believe that may be the same unit that my Uncle Bruno was in. I took some pictures and sent them to my dad and cousin Jodi to ask if Uncle Bruno was in this unit or if he'd skied here when he was younger. I was so intrigued by the notion of a 35 degree incline ski trail on a side of the mountain that you had to actually climb up with your skis in order to go down that I deviated from the trail for a short hike to get to a position where I could actually take a picture of it. It is evidently still maintained, and I also found a cache of first aid equipment for the Thunderbolt Ski Patrol (photo). I know that this isn't the only ski trail of its type, and that it won't be that long before I get to hike Mount Washington and see Tuckerman's Ravine which I remember hearing about when I was a child.
I crossed the summit of Mount Williams and came to the Wilbur Clearing shelter about 2:45 p.m. Too early to stop, so I decided to push on and at least make it to the Sherman Brooke campsite. Between Mount Williams and the Wilbur Clearing shelter I met several day hikers out despite the lousy weather. I also met a trail maintainer who was out on his initial run for the spring, clearing the trail of branches and trees that had fallen during the winter. He asked if I had seen anything between our location and the summit that would need attention and I reported that there was nothing on that piece, but that I'd passed a broken pine tree on the other side of the summit.  It was washed, in its entirety, right into the middle of the trail.
To get to the Sherman Brook campsite, I'd cross through North Adams and Williamstown, MA. As I descended, I met another hiker who was on the way up. A 30 something young man with a black beard that had no gray in it, Rich lives in Great Barrington and is a waiter with some time off, so he wanted to do some hiking. He was wearing a Gore-Tex jacket with the hood up, but I also noticed he was wearing shorts. I figured he must have been cold, but he did not show it. He said he thought he had seen me when he was hiking a section south of Great Barrington, but wasn't sure and I could not recall. I asked about his trail name and he said when he completed a thru-hike in 2004 he was called one name (I can't recall) on the northern portion and he was called Lobo on the southern portion.
After coming down a mile of the trail that was extremely slick, I changed my plans. It had been like trying to hike on grease. I also thought about the fact that it was already cold and wet and my rain gear was soaked. Further, the forecast for tonight was for even colder temperatures down around 30 degrees. So rather than camp out or even attempting to reach the next shelter, I decided I'd come far enough for today.  I’d already surpassed my original goal, so I made a reservation to stay in a Holiday Inn in North Adams. The cost is a bit more than I would have liked, but it had the major convenience of having a restaurant in the facility and coin operated washers and dryers in the basement available for my use. So I got a cab to take me there, and I hope to emerge tomorrow rested with a charged phone and clean, dry gear!","Saint Mary's Church Hostel
","Holiday Inn, North Adams, MA","May 07, Sun",14.20
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563634,"Staying at the Holiday Inn was quite the contrast to my situation a couple days ago after “running away” from bears south of I-90 and setting up camp my tarp at 2 am in a rain storm. As I said yesterday, it's more costly than the hostels I’ve stayed in some on this journey, but I selected this one for the convenience of onsite restaurant and laundry facility. As an IHG member I got a 20% discount on everything including dinner. And for an additional $10 on the room charge, I enjoyed this morning's breakfast. As the photo here verifies, I got a lot for the money. I also took a moment to load all the ingredients into My Fitness Pal app to check what I was consuming, and it came out to 1878 calories. Surprised it wasn't more, but even bumping that figure up to 2000, I will likely burn up that much energy by noon. I haven't stepped on the scale, but I can tell from the way my clothes fit that I have been losing a lot of weight. Weeks ago Willie gave me a sleeping bag tie-down strap that I have been able to use as a belt for my hiking pants. I did not need one when I started. I also used a piece of parachute cord to fashion two holes in my rain pants to cinch them so they'd stay up. 
While using the hotel’s wifi, I finished downloading the ""bird packs"" for the Merlin Bird ID app developed by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Teresa had posted to a facebook group, Capital Naturalist my description of a bird and its call to see if anyone there could help identify it. Members of the group suggested (correctly) what bird I’d seen and also recommended I give this app a try.  I’ve been able to use the app to identify two of the birds that I observed last week. One was a small, black and white bird that I'd been hearing since I started my hike, but only saw recently – it’s a Black-capped Chickadee. To me, its distinctive call sounds like ""whweee, whwooo.""  The other turned out to be a Red-tailed Hawk. I've uploaded screenshots of both birds. The app is neat – to augment the photos, you can listen to the bird’s call and song to help with identification.
So after consuming what seemed like 2 meals worth of food, I checked out of the hotel about 7:45 and took a cab back to the trail. After crossing the Hoosick River via footbridge, I went up what looks like someone's driveway in order to get to the edge of the forest and start climbing up the western side of Williamstown. 
At first the trail was slippery wet like yesterday (photo), but thankfully later it dried out a little as it became steeper. Shortly after signing the logbook at yesterday’s potential (but rejected) campsite, I came to a steep section that led to what the map calls Eph's Lookout. There was also a bad weather bypass trail available with blue blazes, but I chose not to go that way. I think that's really for more extreme winter-type weather. Proceeding, I came to an even steeper section of boulder scramble followed by a set of switchbacks that went up through the rock wall that the boulders must have fallen from. This was a little exciting, because the rocks were slippery and the trail was pretty steep. From the top I took in the view to the west (photo) where even at  10 o'clock in the morning frost remained on the top of a peak I’d climbed yesterday, Prospect Mountain. Just a little further up the trail was the feature the guthook app calls The Rock Garden. That required a very short diversion on blue blazers to get to see it, but it was worth it. I posted a screenshot from my phone of what the Rock Garden looked like in the past - maybe last year. Some of the rocks apparently have come down since then. I tried to lift a big one up into a standing position by myself, but sensing a muscle pain, I decided risking a hernia was not worth it! 
I reached the Massachusetts - Vermont border at about 10:30. My hands were cold as I'd alternated wearing my one mitten on each of them  to keep one warm at a time. As I stood taking a photo of the Welcome to Vermont sign, I noticed that it had begun to snow lightly. I thought that would stop as I started to descend into the valley on the other side of the high point that was the border between the two states, but that wasn’t so. On close observation, I can make out particles of what is obviously solid state H2O,  although I'm not sure it qualifies as snow per se. It looks like the small Styrofoam ball kind of stuff that might really be light hail.
I think the highlight of my day came at about 11:15 when I hiked up on 3 weathered souls sitting on a log across the trail. There were two men and a woman - in their 50's or 60s. I stayed and enjoyed chatting with them for a while. I learned that their trail names where Whiskey, Tango and Foxtrot. They said some people don't know what that means. I told them I had been in the Army 31 years, so I knew exactly what it meant. Haha. The one who resembles Mark Twain (can’t remember if that was Tango or Foxtrot) said that he had been in the Army 2 years, and the other man said he'd been in the National Guard. The woman said, jokingly that she had worked in a bar and that's how she got the name Whiskey. Haha. There were also thru hikers there from Tennessee, and I can't remember where they started their journey from, but they started in February and they had been going through cold weather ever since. They had also stayed in Williamstown last night. I started to pick up a chill from standing still, so we told each other good luck and be safe. As I continued hiking northbound, realized I'd forgotten to take a picture with them.
I passed the sign for the Seth Warner shelter at just past noon, but I decided not to stop there because in that moment it seemed like the 2/10 of the mile off the trail was more than it was worth, so I kept going. I was surprised, but it kept snowing pretty much all afternoon until about 4 o'clock. It also did not melt where the elevation was above 2200 feet which was the case for most of today's hike.  Like yesterday, much of the trail was as wet as a stream and other areas were very muddy. While this meant the rocks were slippery and in some places even dangerous, it also made the non-rock trail ground significantly softer than it would have been if hard and dry. Therefore, waterlogged meant it was actually much easier on the feet than the same distance normally would have been. Where it was very slippery, I imagined that it was kind of like a cross between barefoot water skiing and downhill skiing. I say imagine, because I've never actually water skied barefoot. I got the image of skiing by considering my trekking poles, like ski poles, were coming in very handy navigating the trail’s slippery slopes today!  I only experienced this sensation a couple of times, for distances of no more than about 2 feet.  As I arrived about three miles out from Bennington, I contacted the Catamount Motel and made arrangements to stay there and to get picked up at the trailhead about three and a half miles outside of the city limits.
It's 7:21 and I'm warmed up from a hot shower and headed into town for dinner.","Holiday Inn, North Adams, MA
","Catamount Motel, Bennington, VT","May 08, Mon",18.40
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563957,"I slept well last night, but it’s become the norm that I awaken around 2 a.m. and before going back to sleep, I spent some time with my guthook app, guide book and Google searches to develop a strategy for the next couple of days. 
Jenna is graduating in Putney on Saturday (in 4 days), and that is about 50 miles east from Bennington. Teresa has reservations at a B&B for us starting on Thursday the 11th, so we have time ahead of graduation to help Jenna move out of her dorm room. The distance from here (Bennington, VT) to the next possible place I could reasonably get off the trail and join them (Manchester Center, VT) would be about 41 miles or minimally two days of hiking. The colder weather of late is actually a motivation to go farther (stay moving = warmer); however, the slick wet conditions could slow me down.  So with those factors, I consider three days to be the more likely requirement. I looked at one of two shelter options for tonight: The Kid Gore shelter is 14.4 miles and Story Spring is 19 miles. Both are on the approach to Stratton Mountain which I’ll climb Wednesday, the 10th enroute to destination Manchester Center. There are three shelter options on the far side of Stratton I can use.  With Manchester Center about 20 miles from the today’s likely stop, it will depend on how the weather is and how passable the trails are whether I reach it tomorrow night or Thursday. 
Also, I spent some time researching the locations and stocks of Outdoor Outfitters in the area where I might be able to replace several of the items of my equipment which are damaged or lost. My relatively new replacement set of Oboz Sawtooth mid top hiking boots are starting to come apart exactly like the previous pair had - along the interface between the black tread and the protective beige cushion it is glued to. Both of my trekking poles are damaged:  the tip is broken off one and on the other the basket is missing. The one with no tip is less reliable on rocky surfaces, and the one with no basket tends to penetrate too deeply into the ground, particularly in the mud, and then instead of giving me an advantage pushing forward, having to pull it out slows me down. None-the-less, it's better to have compromised poles than none, as they are effective still for assisting in maintaining balance.  Also, as I shared in a photo a few days back, I had to sew a ripped cargo pocket on my hiking pants.  I’ve lost a hat and a mitten.  After losing the light weight hat (one with visor for warmer days), I improvised a head cover using a field sling from my first aid kit.  This worked great to keep sun from burning my bald head, and on hotter days dousing it with water helped cool me off. But lately, my lost waterproof mitten has been more of a challenge to mitigate in the snowy, colder environment of VT mountains.  As stated before, I’ve adopted a pattern of alternating use, so that one hand can be warm at a time. So, time off the trail is welcomed to connect with my loved ones – daughter’s graduation, visiting my parents’ home, sharing Mother’s day with my two favorite moms, but it is fast becoming a necessity to logistically support the continued hike.   
Finally, I spent time researching rental car and shuttle options to support transportation requirements for the coming days. Curiously, when I searched for rental car agencies in Manchester Center, the closest one was Enterprise in Bennington.  So I may need to get a ride back to Bennington to get a car after I get to Manchester by walking.  
On the way to the trailhead this morning, Alan (hotel driver, see photo) and I discussed hiking and the associated business model that has been set up for the hotel to survive mainly by serving the needs of the hiking community. Alan suggested that most of the folks who come through this early in the year tend to be overachievers, and I shared that yeah, I'm fighting that demon. He also said, “Let me guess, ex-military?” I answered that yes, I had retired as a senior army officer after 31 years service in December of 2016 and that I had chosen to work on this item on my bucket list rather than go back to work immediately.  When I looked at the long list of conditions in my VA medical file, I had a sense of immediacy for use-it-or-lose-it where some issues are concerned.  Others are degenerative conditions that frankly just do not get better with age, so mindful of those, there is no time like the present. I told him that while I feel relatively fit currently, it’s unlikely I will be any more physically capable of withstanding the rigors of an AT thru hike as years wear on. Alan mentioned that a couple of years ago they had a retired 3-star General who stayed with them and that when a tourist couple had seen him in the lobby of the motel and mistook him for a homeless person, they had decided not to stay at the Catamount Inn. Haha.
Alan gave me his number for reference, so I will have to reach out to him to see if I can get the name of that general. Maybe I know him.  Alan also gave me the number for his business partner, Steve who shuttles hikers and suggested that Steve could get me from a trailhead in Manchester to the car rental place in Bennington if needed; so I thanked him.  Perhaps I’ll stay at the Catamount again a couple days from now.
I crossed the foot bridge over the stream just north of the trailhead sometime after 7 a.m. and headed up a steep slope to begin today’s hike. This climb was similar in construction and difficulty to the decent I experienced at yesterday’s end.  There were several places where large stones intended to be available as steps for hikers were too dangerous because they were slippery wet and slanted downward. In one place I could not find a possible way to step up on such a rock without slipping, so I actually had to crawl up onto it in order to keep going (photo). And as was the case yesterday, slow and careful progress eventually got me to the end of that section. Just after I completed that climb, it started to snow again, and by 8 o'clock I was looking over a forest where the ground and the trees we're already completely coated with white snow (photo).
Soon I accidentally arrived at the Melville Nauheim shelter. This happened because I lost sight of the trail and trail markers under the snow. Fortunately, it wasn't far off the main trail. At that shelter was long-distance hiker Noah (photo), so named because he hikes with a long wooden staff. He is 71 years old and originally from Puerto Rico where his family had land in the mountains and he enjoyed it there. He’s retired from 23 years in the Army Reserves and also worked for the state of New York. He got the dream to hike the AT when he was 55.  He’d raised 3 children by then in his first marriage. But after marrying secondly and having more children, he put off his hike plan until he had the time to devote to it. Noah said sometime about 15 years ago he had taken a vacation in Tennessee because his wife was a huge fan of Elvis Presley.  When he was there he saw the wooden staff and decided that he had to have it and has been hiking with it ever since. He'd  been at the shelter where I found him for the past 2 days and intended today to move on now to the next one, the Goddard shelter. He started hiking the Appalachian Trail last year from Springer Mountain, GA and got as far as High Point, NJ.  This year, on April 1st he started in High Point and is continuing northbound. I told him that I was headed towards Manchester and that I figured it was two or three days of hiking from here and he said he was headed that way too, but that for him it might be four or five days. We each hike our own hikes! We discussed how difficult the trail is when slippery and I told him today, depending on conditions, I could end up at Goddard as well! I asked if he had been able to stay warm last night and he said yes he was okay; he had wrapped his tarp around the supports of one of the bunks in the shelter for extra protection. This is the same technique I’d picked up from John and Kevin in the shelter just south of Cheshire, MA a few days ago. It’s what I was expecting to need to do again tonight if I have a shelter stay.
Shortly after that I met hiker Jeff, trail name High Miler (photo), who had met Gandolf and Flicker previously on the trail. A Coloradan who just turned 50 in March, High Miler owns a cement contracting company that primarily supports ski resort development.  An ultra marathon runner, he personally knows Carl Meltzer, the guy who set the AT speed record at just over 44 days. By 1:30 we were at Kid Gore shelter, and pushed on. By 4:00 we were at Story Spring shelter after hiking all afternoon in three inches of snow.  We went faster and further than I have done before. High Miler typically logs hikes of 25 to 30 miles per day, and there is no wonder about his trail name!  Here, we finally met up with the hiker whose tracks we had been following between shelters.  He goes by Preacher and is an experienced hiker.  Preacher travels to other countries to provide oral translations of the Bible
We moved on to a camp site at a lower elevation where there was no snow and was about 48 degrees. After changing and setting up camp,  I had another homemade dehydrated meal from Teresa’s sister Dorothy, Tuscan Beef Stew.  Delicious! We’re expecting temperature to be in the 30s tonight.  At 7:45 pm, I am tired and already in my sleeping bag for the night.  Till tomorrow!","Catamount Motel, Bennington, VT

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563996,"Continued hiking 17.5 miles today with High Miler.  We started from tenting campsite shortly after 6 am, and we reached the summit of Stratton mountain before 8 am (3.9mi up 2000 ft).  We then hiked with short breaks until reaching the route 30/11 trailhead for Manchester, VT.  Like yesterday, pretty much everything above 2400 ft elevation was snowy.  The tower at the top of Stratton was all covered with ice (picture).  When we made it to 30/11, we got a ride from the trailhead to the Mountain Goat Outfitter in Manchester, where High Miler bought a new sleeping pad, as his inflatable had already been patched several times and would not stay filled. We then walked a couple of blocks to Sutton's Place and checked in. We had dinner together tonight, and High Hiler will get back on the trail tomorrow. I'll get a ride back to Bennington in the morning.  There, I'll rent a car and go to an Outdoor Outfitters before heading to Putney. I'll have several zero days assisting my daughter with moving out of her dorm room, attending her graduation (Yay, Jenna!) and then visiting my parents in Chazy, NY for a few days before getting back on the trail. Teresa, who usually transforms/translates my speech-to-text generated notes of interesting word choices and questionable grammar into coherent enough trail journal entries is busy with home-front chores (moving our household goods), packing and will be travelling soon to join us in Putney.  See you when I get back on the trail!","Mile 1633.2 Campsite Past Story Spring Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564247,"I got up about 5:30 like usual to the sound of the birds in Manchester yesterday. I repacked all my stuff and High Miler prepared to return to the trail. He needed to get a ride back to the trailhead, so we said farewell and he headed out. 
I had a cup of coffee at Sutton's Place and then when it was 7:30 and the place was open, I went around the block to the Up for Breakfast restaurant. This was a nice place on the second floor building on Main Street in Manchester Center. During breakfast I completed coordination with the rental car company to pick me up. They did that about 9:30 a.m. and took me to Bennington to actually get the vehicle. Then I drove back to Manchester and visited the Eastern Mountain Sports Outfitter where they were having a closeout sale and everything was 10% off. Out of my half dozen items on my shopping list, they had only socks. And I went to the Mountain Goat Outfitter in Manchester. There I got ankle gaiters. 
Then I drove over to Brattleboro, which is just south of where my daughter goes to college. In Brattleboro I visited Sam's Outdoor Outfitters. That was an impressive store. Frankly it's twice the store and better by far than the two I had visited in Manchester. There I got some new trekking poles, a mosquito net that I can use under my tarp, some Permethrin with which I plan to treat my clothing so they will better repel ticks and other insects, and a new hat to replace the one I lost a couple weeks ago. After I checked in at the West River Inn B&B, I met my daughter at her campus and took her out to dinner. 
Today I will help Jenna move out of the dorm and tomorrow she will graduate. The B&B here is in a beautiful setting - very relaxing, almost off the grid. (Picture)"," Sutton's Place, Manchester Center, VT

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564869,"I've been off the trail for almost a week.  I attended my daughter's graduation (Associates Degree from a 2-year college) and helped her move out of her dorm room. I got to visit my mom in Northern New York for Mother's Day. And I got to take a little time off. I think this was good for my feet, which almost feel normal again. I was hoping it might also be good for my knees and hips, but they still ache. Old man achey.  
I've now returned to Bennington with my rental vehicle which I will turn in in the morning. Once again I am staying at the Catamount Motel. I've arranged with Alan to get a ride out to the trailhead in Manchester after I turn the vehicle into the rental office in Bennington.
It was an absolutely gorgeous day today. I enjoyed the ride on the ferry across Lake Champlain from Plattsburgh. I also enjoyed the ride down Route 7 South from Burlington to Bennington as I passed through Shelburne, Rutland, and Manchester again.  Frequently off to my left I could see the Green Mountain Range in the east. Large peaks linked together by long ridgelines and valleys with the distinctive ""u"" shape of post-glacial landscape.  As I got south of Rutland,I realized that the terrain I was seeing was very likely what I would be climbing in the next few days prior to turning rast with the trail to head towards Hanover, NH.
Couple of posts ago I remember commenting on weight loss. Interestingly, when I got on the scale yesterday, I could see that just one week off the trail seems to have nearly reset my body weight to what it was. I'm only one pound lighter than the day before I started. Of course I recognize that my shape is different and in the one week off I have very quickly packed on water weight simply by not sweating like I had been.
I am anxious to get started hiking again tomorrow, and I hope that the weather will be as nice tomorrow as it was today. Quite the contrast to hiking in snow just a few days ago!","Bennington, VT

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565097,"After having dinner at Ramunto's Pizza, I had a good night's sleep at the Catamount Motel in Bennington, VT. It was lights out by 10 o'clock and up at 5:15 am, packed and ready to go at 6:30. Alan drove over to the Enterprise Rent-a-Car office with me and I dropped off my vehicle. Then Alan drove me from Bennington to the trailhead in Manchester. During the ride he reminded me that he remembered a General O'Neill had stayed at the Catamount a few years ago. With a little research, I was able to narrow down a list of possible candidates to one person and via email I was able to confirm that it was Brigadier General (retired) Mark O'Neill who had through hiked in 2014. His trail name was Opus, like the penguin character in the comic strip Bloom County.
After triple checking my gear, I was on the trail by 7:30. At 8:15 I reached the Bromley shelter and stopped in for a break where I removed the lower part of my hiking pants to convert to shorts. I also added, for the first time, ankle gaiters I got from the Mountain Goat Outfitter in Manchester when I got off the trail last week. Lastly, I applied insect repellent. I should also note here that yesterday, before leaving Chazy, I treated my hiking clothes with the Permethrin treatment I picked up at the Sam's Outdoor Outfitters in Brattleboro last week. Hopefully this will mitigate the risk of disease from ticks or mosquitoes or other insects.
I continued to climb and reached the summit of Bromley around 9:30. I spent some time there taking pictures of the surrounding terrain and the ski slopes. I can't remember if I have skied here, but if so, it was a long time ago. I got underway again around 10 o'clock.
I climbed down the north side of Bromley Mountain and onto the Ridgeline running north into the Peru Peak Wilderness Area. I noticed that the trail smelled of pine again, but different from what I had noted in Massachusetts. Here there was an abundance of short evergreens with short green leafs - more like spruce or hemlock than the longer leaf pine I had seen in Massachusetts. None-the-less, there were a number of branches from these evergreens broken and arrayed on the trail and the pine needles are mixed in with years of fallen oak leaves to help build up a soil on the trail. This seems to have made the trail relatively soft, which is not a bad thing. The trail was also still wet from last week's rain, but not nearly as flooded as it had been. Also on this part of the trail I noted that maintainers had done a good job of diverting downward run off from the mainline of the trail, and that seems to have erosion somewhat under control.
Around noon I arrived at the top of Styles Peak where there is a beautiful view to the east and some open rocks from which to see it. I took a break and sat on these for while. I drank some water and ate a Clif bar for lunch. I still felt relatively full from yesterday's dinner and a week's worth of eating like a hiker but not hiking.
At about 12:30 I got back on the trail and continued North. Between 2 and 2:30 I stopped to get some water and then shortly afterwards arrived at the Peru Peak shelter. I had some beef jerky for a snack and signed the shelter's register logbook. I noticed that Doctor John had been here this morning at 8:30 and Foxtrot, presumably of the Whiskey Tango Foxtrot trio, had stopped here for lunch probably 2 hours earlier. I consumed the remainder of my pint bottle of water and filled it at the nearby stream using aquamira to treat it as I had done with my liter bottle earlier.
Shortly after leaving the Peru Peak shelter I came to a very pretty pond. I could see from my map that this is actually called Griffith Lake. There is also indication on the map that there may have been a Griffith shelter here at one time. There is still a tenting area about 100 yards from the lakeshore and signs at the lake shore prohibiting tenting there. (Pictures).
About 4:30 p.m. I came to the Lost pond shelter and I stopped only long enough to sign the book and top off my water at nearby stream before continuing to hike the 2.9 miles remaining to the Big Branch shelter.
That was my destination for the day.  (I had some words in here about being stiff and sore and the deconditioning from a week of relaxation and little exercise having a bigger impact than I anticipated, but I took them out to leave just this. No whining!)  I greatly enjoyed being outdoors, especially on a nice sunny day and I enjoyed seeing some terrific views from positions of relative wilderness.
I actually got to the roaring branch shelter about 5:30 p.m. For a half an hour I considered staying there but I noticed a lot of downed trees on the hillside near the shelter and big root balls with the trees overturned. And directly above the shelter was a large tree leaning down the hill directly over the shelter. I assessed the construction of the shelter. It was basically sided with two by fours above the foundation. It would not stand up to a tree landing on it. And given all the rain recently and the loosening of the soil on the hillside, I decided not to stay here. The fact that there was no phone signal here was additional motivation to try to climb to another location where I could at least get a message out letting loved ones know that I might not be reachable later tonight. So I treated the water I had from the Big Branch River just before arriving at the shelter, and I took some Motrin to quiet my complaining feet. And I moved on.
Just as I was getting underway, two hikers approached from behind, going the same way as I was.  They seemed tired and short on words, but I learned that they were though hikers headed for the next shelter.  I fell in behind them and tried to ""draft"" on their energy. We got to the Little Rock Pond shelter about 6:45 pm. As did the others, I washed in the pond briefly, dried off, reapplied insect repellent, and changed into dry clothes. Then I cooked a meal of potato with pepperoni, Vienna sausage, and bouillon. During dinner, I learned that the other two hikers were Eric (Air Hockey) and Evan (Highlighter). The former was so named for what he had done to some mice with a puck. The latter, because all his gear is fluorescent green. They had hiked 30 miles today. They hope to finish sometime in June. 
There were also a couple of short distance hikers (out for the week) at the shelter. They were pretty quiet and kept to themselves. 
I then got ready for bed. Long day. Sore feet. Tired. It doesn't get any better than this!","Catamount Motel, Bennington, VT
",Little Rock Pond Shelter,"May 17, Wed",19.80
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565098,"I woke at about 5:15 to the sounds of the birds. It had been a relatively nice night, though I was thirsty from yesterday's hike and consumed two and a half liters of water overall yesterday evening. That's why I had to get up a couple of times. I also woke while hearing something crawling around in the overhang part of the shelter. In the morning, I could see that a mouse had partly consumed a chewy bar that some hiker had left on the edge of a 2 by 4. I packed up and had a Pop Tart for breakfast and then headed out about 6:45. A little more than one mile into today is High Point. I refilled 1 1/2 liters of water. I checked for cell coverage, but still no joy. I remembered that in a text yesterday my dad had forwarded a weather forecast for today of sunny with high in the 90's followed by thunderstorms. I'm not sure how far I will get today, but will likely have to make a decision at some point about shelter if there is bad weather coming in.
At about 8:30, as I was reaching the High Point on the southwest corner of White Rocks Peak, I stopped for a brief break. I checked and found that I had one bar of 4G LTE service, so I uploaded yesterday's Trail Journal and the beginning of today's. I also called the Catamount Motel to let Pete know that I had discovered yesterday evening that I still have the key to Room 11 in my pocket. Oops. I told him I'd mail it back at the first opportunity. I also checked in with the family via text. Finally, I made an iced coffee with a Via packet that Teresa had given me.  I consumed two-thirds of that in less than a second. After I finished my morning post to Trail journals, I moved on.
I noticed today that the forest floor, which had been brown during the majority of my hike up to this point, had in this location become very green with a mixture of sprouting flowers, other plants, tiny evergreens and ferns. Underneath all of that, I could still see years of fallen oak leaves mixed with the residue of last year's crop of ferns and branches of small plants, as well as a multitude of mossy fallen trees. (Picture)
At about 9 o'clock a couple of young, short distance hikers that had stayed at the same shelter with me last night passed me as I was messing with my phone. At about 9:15 I reached the Rock Garden and paused to take a picture of it and make a few contributions to the stacks of rocks that this place is noted for. Or so I thought. About 10 minutes later I caught up with the couple that had just passed me as they had stopped to have breakfast at what actually was the Rock Garden. I stayed and talked with them for maybe 30 minutes. They're both UVM students majoring in mechanical engineering. Max was a Senior and she (trail name Koala) was a Junior. They talked about a robot project they have been working on and I got to brag about my hobby robots for a couple minutes.  As we were talking, a day hiker emerged from a side trail and headed up the AT/LT northbound. As our conversation concluded, I suggested to Max that he might consider using the trail name Machine so they could be Koala and the Machine. I think he liked that, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that he has adopted it.
I continued up the trail northbound and caught up to the day hiker we had recently seen. I never got her name but she was taking the day off from work to celebrate her birthday by hiking. She was a superior conversationalist. She works as a barber with her mother and her sister and she said that being talkative goes with the job. We descended the trail from White Rocks Peak and she peeled off to the left to exit the trail via a local parking lot while I continued to the right northbound. I stopped shortly after that to refill my half liter bottle with water from the Bully Creek. I took a moment to consult my map and noted that while descending and talking I had evidently missed the turnoff for the Green Wall shelter. No big deal since I had not intended to stop there other than to potentially sign the book. I noted that I was about 5.6 miles into today's hike and a little less than four and a half miles from the Minerva Hinchey shelter, which would be roughly my 10 Mile point today. After treating the creek water I'd just collected, I continued northbound.
Shortly before 11:30, I crossed a dirt roads marked on my map as Russell Road and as Sugar Hill Road. Then I crossed VT 140. After crossing the roads, the trail began to climb significantly. Shortly before noon I made a brief diversion from the trail to visit the Dome LED Vista which offered a nice view to the southwest (photo). The trail continued up and over 2 peaks east of Wallingford, VT marked on my map as Bear Mountain.
I stopped at the Minerva Hinchey shelter just a few minutes after 1 pm. There I met sobo hiker ""Swass"".  When I asked, he explained that the name his kids gave him starts with ""sw"" for sweaty, and the second part is not an acronym.  He had also stopped here for some lunch, water, and shade. Outside temp was nearing 90 in the sun. Much nicer in the shade. I had a tuna salad tortilla and a salami tortilla for lunch, along with another Via coffee packet. Then I got a fresh 1.5 liters of water from the nearby piped spring before continuing northbound. 
Less than a half-mile up the trail as I came across the top of a hill to the southwest of Spring Lake, the wind started to pick up significantly. It made a powerful sound as it rushed through the leaves of the trees overhead and it provided a welcomed cooling relief from the heat at the level of the trail itself.
However, it appeared to be somewhat problematic for the flying insects in the area. As it goes for mosquitoes and black flies I was grateful for that. On the other hand, the bee that seemed to have helplessly tumbled into the outside left corner of my mouth was a different story. Suddenly I felt the frantic fluttering of its wings and I instinctively reached with my right hand to brush it away and felt it's hairy body. Apparently concerned that I might eat it, it stung me. Fortunately,  it tried to do so through the corner of my mustache and was therefore only minimally effective. I'm not sure if I ate it or if it survived being brushed away, but only a fraction of a second after it began, this event was over.
Shortly before 3 o'clock I came to the Clarendon Gorge. Below me on the rocks along the side of the Mill River were a number of local sunbathers. And at my level there was a suspension bridge that I crossed. It was bouncy and exciting. (Pictures, video).  I then crossed a road and hiked up along the rocks which were falling into a crack in the earth, sort of a splinter off the side of the Gorge - this was also exciting. It took about 30 minutes. I then came to the Clarendon Lookout which offered a view to the West of the Rutland Southern Vermont Regional Airport (photo).
It was about this point that I also noticed an itching sensation in my nose. Signs of the onset of allergic symptoms. I also had to clean my glasses as they had a buildup of fine powder on them. Probably pollen.
As I had started climbing the gorge, I passed an obvious day hiker who was carrying a pizza box and bag of snacks. We talked about the weather and he said he had heard that it would turn bad after 2:30 p.m. with exceptionally high winds. I got to the top of the gorge and shortly thereafter to the Clarendon shelter around 4 o'clock. There I paused for a snack of GORP and downed the remainder of the water I had on hand and refilled a liter and a half from a nearby stream. I signed the log book in the shelter and I moved on northbound.
Next up was a short .3 mile, but rather steep climb to the top of Beacon Hill. I took a picture of the device mounted on a tower at the top of that Hill, which must be the Beacon. I imagine it services the nearby airport in some way.
From there I hiked 6 more miles to the Governor Clement shelter. Counting side trail distance to a couple of the views that I had chosen to take in, I figured the total distance of today's hike was a little over 20 miles.  On the way, I crossed several roads and up and down several slopes, and I saw several lovely rivers. I picked up water often. I drank a lot of it today, in an effort to replace what I was sweating out. When I arrived at the shelter, I was glad to see the familiar face of Jag Happy (met in Salisbury,  CT). Jag Happy and I spent some time catching up. He told me that he had met a guy who said I had given him his Trail name. This was Jersey Joe, another Joe that I had met a couple weeks ago. I also met another couple of hikers from UVM. Alex and Marley are juniors. He is studying Civil Engineering, and she is studying International Business and Animal Science. Also at the shelter, I met Foxtrot.  He is *not* of the trio, so my earlier presumption was wrong. He and his brother are thru-hiking, and they started at Springer on January 15th. His brother is way ahead somewhere.  As I ate and got ready for bed, Alex played some quiet music on the baritone ukulele that he carries. I found it remarkable how much this created a quiet, relaxed and peaceful atmosphere.  When I was done eating, Alex let me hang my food bag with his and Marley's, on their bear bag line.
Moments later it began to rain, and we could hear the sound of powerful rolling thunder in the distance. I felt very fortunate about the timing of the storm relative to my hike today. 
I checked, but again had no cell service, so I finished drafting today's Trail Journal entry, but will have to wait until tomorrow to upload it.","Little Rock Pond Shelter
",Governor Clement Shelter,"May 18, Thu",20.10
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565243,"Last night it rained until 2 or 3 in the morning. I know it was done by 3 because that's when I got up to pee and I noticed that the sky was clear the stars were very bright. I could see the Big Dipper almost directly overhead slightly to the west. So this morning I got up feeling really rested at about 5:15 when I heard the birds and Jag Happy starting to move around. Foxtrot was also up and the two of them were all set and ready to go about a half an hour before I was. I took my time and had some nut fortified oatmeal, a Pop Tart and a cup of coffee for breakfast. Then I got underway probably around 6:40. This morning's climb would be up Killington about 4 miles of relatively gradual ascent, up an additional 1900 feet from our base elevation of 1906 feet. The peak of Killington itself, should I choose to climb the additional .2 miles off the trail to see it, would be at a little over 4200 feet, making it Vermont's second highest peak next to Mount Mansfield.
After about a mile and a half of this climb, I checked and found that I was now getting one or two bars of cellular service so I slowed my pace so that I could use one hand so my phone can upload yesterday's Trail Journal to get today's started.
Shortly after 9 o'clock I made it to the Cooper Lodge near the top of Killington. The shelter was trashed and there was no log book. I guess this location is too easily accessible to the ski slope, so lots of folks come here just to party. I chased a squirrel out of the pile of trash inside the shelter and then moved on. I found an access trail to the top of Killington near the privy and followed it to the top of a chair lift where I took a couple of pictures and then continued up a well constructed wooden catwalk of stairs with railings until I got to the top of the main lift for the clinic ski area. (photos) Even found another catwalk, this one older and all constructed of iron, that lead further up into the woodline, so I followed it. It transitioned into a normal hiking trail along which I saw a number of markers indicating points on a nature walk, one announcing location of a wood squirrel and another highlighting some form of weathering. At that location, instead of continuing to follow the trail, I broke off and climbed through some bushes and over some rocks to get to the actual Summit of Killington more quickly. There I took some more pictures and when I had walked around to the actual open rocky top of the mountain, I paused and took a video in order to capture the sound of the wind (very powerful) blowing through the tower at the top of the mountain and the trees around it. I didn't stay there long, not because of the wind or the height, but rather because I didn't want to be cooked by the microwaves coming out of the massive antenna located about 20 feet away. So I climbed back down to the shelter, paused to update my Trail Journal and had a snack before moving on. Intended to take on more water at the upcoming water source.
When I got up this morning, I noticed a small patch of skin on front of my left shoulder appeared to have a patterned rash. From the look of it I thought that this was an irritation caused by the webbing on the inside of the shoulder strap of my backpack. I recalled having had something similar on my shins in my first week of hiking on the trail and previously during preparatory training. When I had consulted my Doctor the allergist told me it was nonallergic urticaria. She said no one really knows exactly what triggers it, it could be body heat and pressure in combination with moisture from sweating softening the skin. With my shins I had learned that my skin seems more sensitive to my synthetic socks when my body temperature was elevated. I didn't think much of the rash on my shoulder at the moment and just dressed. However,after I left the Cooper Lodge shelter and continued northbound on the trail that rash on my left shoulder became increasingly irritating and distracting. I began to notice a similar irritation on my left shoulder. I tried re-positioning the shoulder straps of my backpack, but it didn't seem to help much. I also noticed a general sense of tightening and discomfort in my esophagus. Eventually, around 11 o'clock I stopped because I was becoming concerned that this situation might evolve into a more systemic allergic reaction which could be dangerous. I took off the synthetic Army 10 Miler shirt I had worn yesterday and this morning. It was damp, so I applied hydrocortisone to the irritated skin and put on my smartwool-based layer long sleeve shirt. I also took another Allegra antihistamine in addition to the one I had taken earlier in the morning. I put my backpack on again and tightened the waistband all the way up so I would carry most of the weight on my hips.  I left the chest strap disconnected and wore the shoulder strap lower around the upper part of my biceps and I continued hiking slowly.
I stopped at the Churchill Scott shelter which is about 400 feet off the trail.  There I had a peanut butter and jelly tortilla for lunch and I applied some more hydrocortisone to the irritated spot on my left shoulder. I also pulled out a lightweight hiking towelette and the complimentary sewing kit I had picked up at I think the Holiday Inn in North Adams Massachusetts. With the sewing kit I was able to fasten the towelette on the inside of the left shoulder strap in a way that should help better distribute the weight of the pack more evenly than the mesh webbing of the shoulder strap itself. I also adjusted my ankle gaiters as I was feeling a similar irritation around the top of them where they rub against my legs. I drank some water and then I got underway again.
I hiked the few miles down to where the trail crosses Route 4 and encountered a sign that explained that the Appalachian Trail has been rerouted. The old trail in Killington is now referred to as the Sherburne Trail. And the new Appalachian Trail is routed through public lands that will forever be protected and blah blah blah. The net effect is that the trail no longer passes The Inn at Long Trail. I could tell that two miles further up I could Branch off of the new Trail and take the Sherburne Trail a mile down hill back to The Inn at Long Trail, but I didn't feel like doing that. Instead, I hiked through past the point at which the Long Trail splits and goes Northwest and the Appalachian Trail goes Northeast and then passed the Sherburne Trail and eventually came to the Gifford Park campsite which is really nice and very close to Kent Pond (photos). About a half-mile later, the trail came to the Mountain Meadows Lodge which is situated in a really nice spot on the shore of Kent Pond. Unfortunately the lodge was fully booked up for a wedding party. So I had to keep going. I hiked out to Thundering Brook Road. On the way I called both the Killington Motel and The Inn at Long Trail. The Inn I discovered is closed until next Friday the 26th of May.
I walked a mile from the trailhead at Thundering Brook Road up to Route 4 and then back toward the Killington Resort Access Road. Just past the access road I came to the Killington post office so I went in, purchased an envelope, and mailed the key to Room 11 back to Pete and Alan at the Catamount Motel along with a thank you note and my apologies for forgetting to give it back to them previously. I then walked next door to the Killington Motel and checked in.
After getting a nice shower and changing, I walked back over to the office at the Killington Motel and the owner Robin give me a cup of coffee and I chatted with her for almost an hour about hiking and my assignments in the Army. Then I went next door to the Killington Deli to inquire about getting a ride to a nearby restaurant. Evidently there are plenty of restaurants only about 2 miles away. However, today there was no Uber service and I couldn't find a taxi even with the assistance of three employees of the deli. I didn't feel like walking 2 miles, so I went back to my room at the Killington Motel and ordered for delivery from Yoshi Sushi which was recommended to me by one of the ladies at the deli. I ordered egg rolls, steamed dumpling, a small wonton soup, and Szechuan chicken.
I plan to eat that, get a good night's rest followed by breakfast at the Killington Motel, and then get back on the trail in the morning.","Governor Clement Shelter
",Killington Motel,"May 19, Fri",15.60
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565363,"I sorta slept in at the Killington motel until almost 6:30 a.m. I then took almost 45 minutes getting my stuff together and then went to the motel office to get some breakfast. And I turned in my key! Haha. During breakfast I chatted with a couple of gentlemen in their 60s who were brothers from somewhere in Florida just out on retirement vacation with their wives who were evidently still in their rooms. The motel owner Steve made me a complimentary ham and cheese English muffin. I also got to have several cups of his home roasted coffee. This is his hobby and he makes about 1500 pounds of coffee a year. Evidently he imports it by the truck load. I think I had both Honduran and Ethiopian coffee. It was good. After breakfast I left the motel and walked the roughly 1 mile back down Route 4 and Thundering Brook Road past the Mountain Meadows Lodge to the trailhead. All together it was about 8:30 a.m. when I finally got on the trail again northbound.
About 9:30 I got to thundering Falls and took a short video clip there. Really pretty.
Shortly before ten o'clock but still just north of Thundering Falls I ran into what appeared to be a family Trail maintenance activity. There was a thin bearded gentleman about 6 feet tall named Dick Andrews who is the president of the local troll maintenance club. Dick's trail name is pond bagger because he likes to bag ponds rather than Peaks. Haha. With him was Stephanie, a younger woman wearing a Park Service hat and t-shirt who is in fact part of the park service. And a young boy named Jasper with a blue hat. I thanked them for taking care of the trail and chatted with them for a moment and took a picture together with them on my camera and on Stephanie's.
As I hiked I noted that today the trail and the forest in general was relatively dry. The leaves made a rustling crunching sound as I disturbed them with my feet while walking. There was also a new fragrance. I could still smell the faint scent of thyme in some places but dominating that were several mixed aromas. As I scanned for a source I could see an occasional Trillium plant, lots of fun bowling fern, some small wildflowers and so on, but nothing that was the obvious source of any of these scents. I also occasionally noticed that some of the bushes seemed to be starting to sprout leaves and that most of the trees were not green so I think this combination of smells was probably coming from all of the things that I just mentioned and just wasn't noticeable on the more humid days of this past week.
Studying my map I learned that the trailhead climbed a terrain feature known as the round pinnacle. Then it stayed on relatively high ground about 2400 feet and went up Quimby Mountain. Its then descended the eastern side of that mountain through a Valley and toward Quimby Brooke and Notown Vermont. The weather was absolutely gorgeous. Not a cloud in the blue sky and while my thermometer read over 80 degrees, in the breezy shade of the trail it felt more like 70.
At about noon I arrived at the Stony Brook shelter and I stopped for a short break to change out of hiking pants and into a pair of running shorts. Much cooler layer of attire. I was back on the trail about 1230 about 6 miles in as I had anticipated with an 8 o'clock start and about 1500 feet of climbing up and 800 down - this was right about on pace. But at that point I still had 10 miles to go for the day to make it to the Winturri shelter with not a whole lot of alternative options in between. I consulted my gut hook app to look at the elevation profile for the afternoon and found it it was another one of those 5 bump days. So just to mentally keep track of what was coming by referring to each of these bumps as a day of the week, I noted that Monday was a 800 foot climb, Tuesday was a 400 foot climb, Wednesday was a 600 foot climb, Thursday 200, and Friday 300. Of course each of these was followed by a descent. I was starting off at a 1400 foot elevation at some Road. And each subsequent  descent would return me to roughly 2000 feet.
This would take me over Bull Hill and to 2 separate lookouts above Lakota pond. The first of these, on top of Wednesday, would offer only a narrow view through the trees, and the second, on top of Thursday, featured a private cabin with a ladder to a lookout on top of the building, offering a complete panoramic view. I took several pictures up there. Following that would be the climb up Friday and the descent to the Wintturi shelter. I got to the shelter around 5:45 and I had it all to myself. I pulled two liters of water from a nearby stream that had a beautiful waterfall. I took a picture. Then I set up my stuff inside the shelter and prepared my dinner. I ate a tuna salad tortilla, a peanut butter and jelly tortilla, some beef jerky tender bites, and with boiling water I made a rice with vegetables and black bean and lime sort of stew. It was awesome. After dinner I cleaned up my trash and food and I hung up a bear bag. I had no cell phone service at my shelter itself but I found that if I stood on top of the big rock where I hung my bear bag I could get one bar of 4G LTE service. So I took a moment to stand there and update my trail Journal.
 Then I went to bed around 8 o'clock.","Killington Motel

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565452,"This morning the light in the eastern sky and sound of the birds woke me at 4:45. It was chilly, maybe in the low 40s. Not that this was colder than any other day. But as I looked at the weather forecast, I could see that it was going to be mostly sunny and warm today, so I didn't want to keep cold weather clothes on. But it wasn't quite warm enough to change. So I took my time organizing my stuff and making breakfast. I had nut fortified oat meal. I also had three Snickers bars and a pop tart and two cups of coffee. As the coffee and the oatmeal got me warmed up, I changed and put my boots on. Then I finished packing, got a fresh liter of water treated and started hiking about 6:45. The first piece of the trail was mostly downhill and then I had a short uphill section before I reached the roughly two and a half mile point where I found the ""Ascutney View.""  Just before I reached this piece of relative high ground I detected the faint, sweet smell of fresh manure. I stopped at the Ascutney View and took a picture of the mountain to the South Southeast. I could make out the faint outlines of two or three ski trails on the Northern face of the mountain. And I had a flashback to what must have been about 1971 when when my dad had taken me and my brothers skiing at that mountain. I remember like it was yesterday: my first experience on anything other than an easy trail. How my wooden skis with cable bindings seemed to have a mind of their own! I recall observing my brother's ski flying past me and bouncing off the trail into the woods and then my brother, sliding as I had done several times, on his butt chasing after the ski. That whole Mountain was white that day. The vegetation and sky provided contrast with various shades of grey. Either that, or my memory is just black and white. Haha.
I'm not sure where the manure smell came from. I could also hear a dog barking somewhere to the east, but I couldn't see any farmland. About 8:30, however, I completed my descent down the south face and merged onto the southwest corner of an open pasture through which to the Northeast I could see several buildings clustered along the side of Route 12. One of these that was painted the traditional red was obviously a barn. My gut hook app said that there should be an ice cream stand just north of where the trail crossed route 12; but I couldn't find it, so I moved on. Shortly after 10 am,  I crossed Stage Road and a small brook over which was installed a wooden bridge. Just past the bridge I met a group of hikers. Perhaps a dozen. Both young men and young women. The women wore long dresses and some sort of strapped cap on their heads. All of them had good sized backpacks set on the ground near them. I stopped and chatted with them for a while. I learned that they were doing a 60 mile section hike from Hanover to Clarendon. Some of them were from New Hampshire and some of them were from Pennsylvania. I took a picture with them and asked how I should refer to them in my journal. I asked if any of them had trail names. None of them did. One young man volunteered that I could call them the Piker Hikers. He explained that Pikers was the name of the church group they were all part of. We bid each other a safe and enjoyable journey and I moved on.
After I crested the next relative peak about halfway between Stage Road and Bartlett Brook Road, I spotted something strung across the old logging road that the trail was using at this point. Looking closer, I saw that it was two plastic tubes about 3/8 of an inch thick strung about 8 feet high across the road between trees on opposite sides. Looking closer still, I saw that this was part of a relatively large maple sap collection infrastructure for what was probably a small maple syrup manufacturing operation. As I descended further down the hill, the clear plastic tubing I had initially seen merged into a three-quarter inch black plastic tube, which paralleled the right side of the road all the way to where it emerged into a field and then routed to the edge of that field. I could not see exactly where it terminated. However, I could now see several houses further down the hill on the opposite side of the field, probably along Bartlett Brook Road, and I'm sure that one of these was the maple sugar farm.
I crossed Bartlett Brook Road and Bartlett Brook and continued northbound. After cresting the next peak and descending its Eastern side, I came to another open field on a hillside. Here the trail entered the field on the downhill side of a stand of trees that sat aside an old rock wall that separated an upper field from the lower field. To the right I had a beautiful view of the valley houses and Pomfret Road which ran north-south through the valley. I took some pictures here.
On the far side of the field there was another standard forest and hillside through which I hiked, and then I came to Pomfret Rd. But before I could cross the road, I had to cross the brook for which it was named, and there was a steel cable strung across the brook at about waist to chest height above some rocks to assist with that. But it looks to me like the water must be a little higher than usual, because there was a good eight foot section in the middle of that crossing in which all of the rocks were underwater and therefore, I assumed, slippery. So using my poles for balance, I used a different set of rocks to hop across the river. When I got to the second to last hop, I had to pause and prepare myself. The next jump looked a lot bigger from where I was now standing then it had when I was on the the bank of the river. So I crouched, made sure my poles were solidly set in the river bed at a point between here and there, and I jumped and landed on the far riverbank on a rock just big enough for my right foot. Whew! I then scrambled up the embankment of the road, crawled over the guardrail, and crossed the road. Of course ,then it was time to climb another hill in the woods. And it was pretty steep. About halfway up I met a guy who was about 100 feet off the trail when I first saw him. He was wearing khaki pants, a light blue sweatshirt, and a green baseball cap. In his right hand he was holding a shovel of some kind with a scoop about 10 inches long. In his left hand he was carrying a plastic bag, the contents of wish I could not see. He asked and I confirmed that I was northbound on the AT and he explained that he was just out foraging. For mushrooms. He said he lives just over there, pointing uphill to the Northeast. After we walked and talked together for a few minutes, he went off and continued foraging.
At the top of that hill I had cellular service for the first time today, so I paused to upload some photos and journaling while I had a brief lunch break.
Between 12:30 and 1:00 I came upon two day hikers who had passed me earlier. We stopped and exchanged pleasantries. Their names were Randy and Jen. They explained that they they live nearby and were out for a 5 mile loop . They hope to hike the Long Trail soon. I took a photo with them. At the bottom of the next hill, I crossed Claudius and Asia Outland Road and I met a couple in their sixties. This was Ken and Sheri. They were both wearing Long Trail hats. The used to be very active in the maintenance of the Queechee section of the trail north of here. I took a picture with them and then climbed the next hill. As I reached the woodline half way up the hill, I had a beautiful view back to the west where I could see cattle from the farm across the street arrayed across the relatively steep slope of the field above that farm.
I stopped in the Thistle Hill Shelter for lunch. I left there shortly after 2 p.m. and I noticed the sign at the trail indicated I'd done 11.8 miles so far today. And that the Happy Hill shelter was 8.7 miles from that point. I also checked my gut hook app and saw that it indicated I was 12.9 miles from Norwich and 14.5 miles from Hanover, NH.
About 4:30 I came to West Hartford, VT.  I crossed the White River and walked along Vermont Route 14 through the rural town. I turned right on Tiger Town Road and then went through a two-bridge underpass under Interstate 89. Yet another interstate to add to the list.  Then I briefly turned right on Podunk Road. Assuming that this goes to a place called Podunk, I realized I've been wrong my entire life thinking that this place was fictitious! Then once again I headed up into the woods. I had 3 miles and 1200 feet of climbing to do before I would reach the Happy Hill shelter where I intended to stay for the night. Shortly before 5:30 I reached Podunk Brook, which was a beautiful water source, so I stopped to rehydrate and fill another liter bottle of water. I considered stopping here altogether and camping just south of the brook where there were some relatively flat soft spots between large pine trees. I checked the weather, however and found that there was a good chance it would start raining around 3 a.m. and continue raining tomorrow. I resolved to continue to the shelter in order to keep my gear dry through the night.
I got to the Happy Hill shelter about 6:45 and again had the whole thing to myself. I set up my stuff and changed out of my sweaty clothes. Bad news was that when I checked for ticks I found two already bitten in. I removed them and reapplied insect repellent. I then took a few minutes to walk down to the nearby stream and bathed my feet in the cold water. Then I had dinner and prepared for bed. The rain did not wait till 3am. It started slowly on and off, as soon as I had entered the shelter. Then it began more continuously about 7:30 pm. I had a peanut butter tortilla, gorp, and bouillon soup for dinner. No more food in the food bag. Just coffee for breakfast. I'll resupply with the mail drop my dad sent me when I get to Hanover, NH tomorrow.","Wintturi Shelter
",Happy Hill Shelter,"May 21, Sun",21.10
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565591,"About 12:30 a.m. I noticed that my inflatable insulation pad was going flat. I blew it up again. Then it went flat again about 20 minutes later. Then I blew it up again. Then it went flat about 10 minutes later. So I got out of my sleeping bag, put on my warm Under Armour running pants and my insulating Patagonia jacket and I set about repairing my inflatable mattress. I have a patch kit that requires you to 1st locate the hole, which you have to do by getting the mattress wet and looking for bubbles. I found two holes. Then you deflate the mattress and apply a sealing compound to the hole, apply the patch, smooth it out, and then put a pot of boiling water on top of it to let it cure for 1 hour. So I did basically that for each of the two holes. Of course I did them one at a time, because I only have one pot in which I can boil water. 
While I was waiting for the second patch to cure, I heard strange sounds coming from down the hill in the forest. I wasn't sure if it was growling or the distant sound of a truck. The rain was making noise hitting the leaves of the trees and the roof of the shelter, and that made it hard to identify.  At one point, I heard a branch break somewhere behind the shelter, like something had stepped on it, and I wondered what it could be. Growls, heavy enough to break branches on the ground... I started formulating defensive strategies. 
Fortunately, I didn't end up needing any of those strategies. I woke up to light and the sound of the rain at about 5:45. There were a couple of bird sounds mixed in. It was chilly, and the high humidity made it feel like it was sucking the heat out of me. So I made a cup of hot coffee. I dressed and packed up to go. This took a lot longer than it sounds, because I went through several changes of mind about how much clothing I should wear to balance the heat generated by hiking and the cold lost to the wet rain. I set out on the trail about 7:15 a.m.
Somewhere around 10 am, I arrived at the south/western edge of Norwich, VT.  As I walked through town, I met hiker Preacher again. We walked together and told stories, and we took pictures when we crossed the bridge over the Connecticut river into New Hampshire.  He had stayed in Norwich the night before, and he was starting out northbound again.  We eventually went separate ways when we got to downtown Hanover, NH. He continued up the trail, and I checked into the Six South Street hotel. Today would be a ""nero"" for me. 
I then went to the post office to get my package, and I had lunch at a nearby restaurant called Molly's. I also picked up a few miscellaneous items at a CVS pharmacy. I had Thai food for dinner. Too much. I had to go for a walk after dinner to help the food settle. I wandered in the Dartmouth campus for a while. Now hat distance did not count towards my miles for today, but since I had only done 6 trail miles, it didn't really matter. It did not wear on me at all. Enough town talk; this is a trail journal.
Oh - I also figured out how to link videos to this site.  I posted one from weeks ago when I was at West Point, and I posted another from a few days ago (Killington summit). You should be able to see them if you click the ""hamburger"" (Three lines) icon.","Happy Hill Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565742,"I woke up at the Six South Street Hotel in Hanover, NH this morning at about 5:30, but decided to sleep in till 6:30. I had breakfast at the hotel and then visited an ATM to get some cash. Then I walked further up the trail, until I came to the Community Center. I waited until 9:00, and then for $2.00 I did my laundry.  The center had a set of Hanover High School gym shorts/t-shirts for use when doing laundry, so I borrowed them and washed pretty much all my clothing, some of which was getting pretty smelly from sweaty hiking, and some of which I washed to reduce the likelihood of permethrin irritation. The repellent itself is supposed to remain effective through six washes.  I sat in the sun on a bench outside the center while my clothes washed. I finished up and left the community center headed north on the trail around 11 am.
At the edge of town, I entered the wood line through a pass along the edge of the Hanover High School baseball field and went up into the woods. It was a relatively steep climb right off the bat. The forest is beautiful with the moisture of yesterday's rain still on the ground wetting all the leaves again. All sounds were muffled. But the sun shone nicely through the translucent green leaves and the birds were lively with their regular chorus. I passed the Velvet Rocks shelter sometime before 11:30 and decided to just keep going rather than go in there and sign a logbook. It didn't feel like enough progress yet today married any kind of stoppage.
As I kept going I took some pictures of the trail and of more rock walls in the middle of the woods and a foundation for a long gun building of some kind. I've seen a couple of those before in other states but I had not photographed one so I did that today.
I climbed over South and then North Moose Mountain and Holt's Ledges in order to get to the Trapper John shelter. I had considered stopping at the Moose Mountain shelter which would have been at my 10 Mile point for today. I thought that was reasonable given that I didn't really get on the trail until 11 a.m. However it was 4 p.m. when I got to the Moose Mountain shelter so I kept going. From both South Moose Mountain and Holt's Ledges there were some fantastic views and I took some pictures of those.","Six South Street Hotel

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565905,"Today I got up at about 5:30 as usual. I had a breakfast of Pop-Tart and GORP. I spent some time thinking about a strategy for how to hike through the White Mountains. This is probably the most beautiful and most dangerous part of the AT. I decided to hike to the Hexacube Shelter today, and then tomorrow either stop at the Jeffers Brook shelter or the town of Glencliff, NH, just short of Mount Moosilauke. That mountain will be the first major climb in the Whites at 4802 feet, and a reputedly very steep descent on the north side. I checked the weather and confirmed that it still shows an expectation of rain tomorrow and Friday. But it showed that today would be a clear day, so I packed up my stuff and headed out.
I left the Trapper John shelter at about 7:30 in the morning and climbed over Smart's Mountain, passing the Lambert Ridge on the way there and the Eastman Ledges afterward. I took pictures of nice views at each of these places. I reached the Hexacube shelter at about 3:45 p.m. which was a little earlier than anticipated, so I considered changing my plans and going further. In the end, I decided not to do that because I will still want to stop at the base of Mount Moosilauke. I don't want to try to climb that Peak after having walked 10 miles and climbing a couple smaller peaks en route.
I got out my references and studied them again and decided that it'll be my preference tomorrow to stop at Glencliff, NH where there is a hostel I could potentially stay. I called the number listed for them but got a recording that indicated they open for the season officially on the 1st of June, but that they will likely be open the last week of May. I verified in my reference material that I will reach the hostel before the Jeffers Brook Shelter, so if I can't stay at the hostel I will still be able to move on to the shelter.","Trapper John Shelter

Pictures climbing Mt Cube Trail. Smarts Mountain to south, with clouds coming in. Several pictures from the summit to the south and west. Short video showing wind speed and cloud movement. Descending Mount Cube, I came across stone and stairs very similar to those I climbed up on Smart's Mountain. Made me pause to double check the map and make sure I had gone the right direction. 
Around 10:30, I got to the base of Cube Mountain and got water at a brook.  Shortly thereafter, I arrived at HWY 25 and met hiker Helper Guinness. He is a friend of Jag Happy. Jag and his other friend, Redirect are maybe a half day behind me and Guinness was hiking south to meet them as they come north. Jag had evidently indicated he wanted to take a day off now because of the bad weather coming in. Guinness will pick the two of them up and they will drive to a hotel somewhere. Guinness and I also talked about hiking in the White Mountains. He has done several pieces of it over the years. He talked about how long to expect various pieces to take and recommended shelters and huts to stay at. We took a picture together and I sent it to him so that he can forward it to Jag and Redirect. Then we bid each other farewell and safe hiking and went opposite directions.
Around 11:30 I came to gravel Cape Moonshine Road, and just beyond found that someone had set up a Welcome to the Whites sign and a trail magic stand under a tarp. I signed the log book. The food and water was all gone, but I took some toilet paper. It's the little things!
Shortly after 1 o'clock I came to Lake Tarleton Road. I noticed the sky was starting to darken and it was beginning to drizzle. At the road crossing there was also a power line crossing the road.  As I went under it, I could hear it crackling and the air smelled of ozone. I don't know if that was from the power line or from the rain cloud. Shortly after I crossed the road, I stopped for a quick lunch break. I did not want to stay too long given the rain, and I had four and a half miles to go before my intended stop. So I ate a tuna salad tortilla and then got back on the trail. Coming down, I took a picture of dark clouds. Very windy. 
BTW, yesterday I heard from High Miler that he got off the trail in Lincoln, NH, after Moosilauke. Too much snow there and onward, he said. Also had an employee quit w/o notice and was needed back home. Will come back to AT in the fall. 
At 2 pm on top of Mist Mountain, confirmed arrangements to stay at Hikers Welcome Hostel. Arrived there just before 4 pm. Preacher was there, but he had not arrived in time to get his package from the post office. We talked. Power went out in the whole town.  Probably a tree blown over on a power line.  The lady across the street stopped in and helped Preacher contact the postmaster who let him come get his package after hours (she lives next to the post office). We talked some more. The owner showed up about dark. He got frozen pizza and ice cream sandwiches from the freezer.

Our trip across the top of Mount Lafayette coinciding with an entire school class of kids from Canada who were traversing the summit was particularly interesting. The winds were probably 50 to 60 miles an hour and in addition to rain, sleet started falling and the temperature dropped.

I noticed that the vegetation at higher elevations was significantly different from that at lower ones. At the lower elevations, the mix of trees and bushes was similar to what I had seen in Vermont and previous States. But at the higher elevations in NH, it was almost exclusively shortleaf pines. While there was still snow on the ground (in some places as deep as my knees), there was often also a covering of short branches from the pine trees.

Instead, there were the songs of some new birds, but without access to network, the Merlin app from the Cornell Ornithology Lab could not help in identification. There were small grayish-brown birds with additional black and white feathers mixed in that were new to me.  I was not able to associate their calls just yet, but I'll be on lookout and will listen carefully in hopes of identifying them once I have use of the app.  
Met hiker Johnny from London, who graduated from Yale in December. Johnny had hiked Georgia to Connecticut before and wants to finish now.  He hikes in sandals, and as expected has gnarly feet (picture). A mile or so toward Crawford Notch General Store and Camp Ground we got a ride from John, manager of the camp ground.  John set us up with a cabin for 4; and we did laundry, ate munchies and relaxed while enjoying the Crawford Notch view of the mountains to the north west.

On the way we had breath-taking views of the valley to the South and the West, especially from the peaks of Mount Webster and Mount Jackson where we had terrific 360-degree panoramic visibility (Pictures). As holders of AT thru-hiker cards (picked up at Kinsman Pond), we got free soup and baked goods at the hut for lunch.
Then we hiked on to the Lake of the Clouds Hut. En route, it got cloudy and started to rain. The trail passed Mount Eisenhower and Mount Monroe.  In the vicinity of Mount Eisenhower the rain turned to sleet, and by the time we passed Mount Monroe, it progressed from hail to snow.  The wind got even stronger than what we had experienced on Mount Lafayette.  We arrived at the Lake of the Clouds hut at about 5 pm and the croo took us in on work-for-stay terms (six thru-hikers all together, since we saw Johnny again here, as well as Foxtrot and ""Chuck"" w/ no trail name.) We were very glad to have shelter, as it was pretty nasty out (pictures). We got to sleep on the floor in the open area in the center of the hut.

Johnny (who hikes in shorts and sandals) tried to hike down off the mountain, via Tuckerman's Ravine, not knowing it's closed because of crevasses in snow and ice that get up to 60 ft deep, with water falling down the mountain under the snow.  He got two miles and had to come back.  He was obviously hypothermic, so we helped get him warmed up.

Jag, Redirect, Billy Goat, and I headed up to the summit, too.  
Initially, there was zero visibility, but far less wind than the previous day, and no rain.  As we climbed toward the summit of Mount Washington, it got a little clearer, but remained cloudy and cold.  There was a lot of snow and ice on the way up, and the top of the mountain was encased in about three inches of ice.  I got several good photos, including a group picture at the summit sign. 
As we headed north from the summit on the Presidential Traverse, we actually crossed the track of the cog train just before it went by (pictures).
We accidentally summited Mount Clay, when we missed the split between the AT and the Summit Trail. (Extra credit. Haha)
As we passed Mount Jefferson, we had to cross a steep, wide snow field (pictures). Then we passed through a spot called Thunderstorm Junction, continued by Mount Adams and down to the Madison Springs hut.  By now, the sky was blue and sunny, and it was actually warmer outside the hut, where we stopped and got some hot soup. 
Then Jag, Redirect, Billy Goat, and I hiked up Mount Madison and then down the long boulder climb to Pinkham Notch. This took us until almost 9 pm.  We called the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel on the way down, and the owner, Eric, picked us up at the Visitor's Center by Route 16.  I got lots of pictures throughout the day.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567644,"Today was a zero - mile rest day needed in part because of the unseasonably nasty weather, in part because Don (Jag Happy) really needed a day off and in part because I needed the rest myself.  The last three days were very physically demanding. The two days we took to hike completely through the Presidentials were the most difficult I've had to do so far. And our weather decision to not hike on Saturday (while I'm certain was the right decision) meant staying still in a humid 40 degree hut watching our breath make fog for a whole day, trying to play games and not notice that our energy was slowly being sapped.  Thus, we were all pretty tired. Tom (Redirect) most noticeably tired, was also struggling with his own scheduling challenges.
So, this morning I got up at the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel (which the owner, Eric, is renaming the ""Rattle River Lodge and Hostel"" after the nearby river), at about 6:30 am, had coffee, and at about 7 am, Jim (Eric's key assistant) made us waffles (excellent!) and all we could eat.  Billy Goat took a shuttle ride from Eric to Pinkham Notch, and hiked the 21 miles to the hostel by himself with no pack, no water, and no head-lamp.  A calculated risk on his part.
Later in the day, Eric took Don, Tom, and me into Gorham, where we had lunch, went to an outfitters where I got a new folding insulating foam pad and some fuel, and also stopped in at the library which had public computers. When we got back to the hostel, we were joined by two other sets of guests. Two were retirees from Florida: one was a former through-hiker (Stretch), and the other two were a retired couple working to add another section to their accumulation of AT mileage. This larger gathering of hikers spent the next few hours sharing hiking stories.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567838,"This morning, after another breakfast of all-you-can eat waffles, Jag, Redirect and I got a shuttle ride from Eric back to the Pinkham Notch Visitor's Center, and we hiked over the two Wildcat peaks and down to the Carter Notch hut. This was again the most difficult climbing we have had to do thus far. In particular, I was impressed by the physicality required to climb one 20 foot cliff to get up the first Wildcat. The first 10 feet was a vertical v-shaped crack with no hand-holds, almost a chimney. I had to climb by wedging my feet in the crack and pushing horizontally with my left arm and vertically with my right.  I got some pictures along the way, and we got soup from the croo on arrival at the hut.
We hung out in the main building and chatted for a while. Then we were asked to wait in the upper bunk house from 5 pm until the croo had finished serving dinner to the paying guests. We all went up to that building and used room number 8 which had 6 bunks in which we occupied 3.  We spread out our wet clothing hanging it on hooks to dry, and used the wool blankets on the bunks to lay down and keep warm.  Jag gave me Kurt Vonnegut's Sirens of the Titans to read, and I got through about 15 pages before passing out. 
At about 7pm we moved back into the main building, ate leftovers from the Hut's evening meal and helped clean up as our work-for-stay arrangement. Then we got set up for the night and went to bed around 9:30 p.m.","White Mountains Lodge and Hostel
",Carter Notch Hut,"Jun 06, Tue",5.90
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567856,"Last night around midnight I was awakened by the sounds of several people entering the Carter Notch Hut and walking on the wooden floor. At one point I saw that one of them had climbed on a bench in order to stand on the table next to where I had set up my sleeping bag. This person and another were working to remove a long wooden object from the ceiling. As one of them used a red light headlamp to help see what they're doing, I noticed markings and a shape that indicated this object was an oar. I recalled hearing while we were at Lakes of the Clouds Hut that the Huts' croos have a tradition of stealing sacred objects from one another and that the oar was one of these. I turned on my headlamp with red light and was able to see that this was Eliza Sam and two other members of the croo from Lakes of the Clouds Hut, who had evidently come to the Carter Notch Hut to steal back the oar while we were there. In the morning, while Rachel was making coffee, she explained that they had also stolen a sword which is another of the four items. Interestingly, other members of the Carter Notch Hut had also traveled to the Lonesome Lake Hut to steal an item known as Mr. Geeves, which is a small statue of a server man that they like to place near their self service food item table.
Jag Happy, Redirect, and I got up individually, between 4:50 and 5:15. We used hot water to make oatmeal for breakfast and enjoyed the coffee that Rachel had made. As we prepared to leave, Rachel thanked us again for doing a good job on the chores that had been assigned to us as our work for stay arrangement, and I took a picture of us with her. We hit the trail around 6:50 a.m. It was light and we could see blue sky and the sun beginning to shine on the eastward facing sides of the mountains to the west of us. We were glad to have a nice day after yesterday's cold, freezing rain. We also felt good about the decision we had made to split the 21 mile distance between the Pinkham Notch and Gorham into two parts, the shorter of which we did yesterday in the bad weather and the longer of which we would do today in the better weather.
The trail very quickly became a steep ascent of the Carter Dome, which would be our highest climb for the day. I felt fortunate that the Carter Notch Hut itself is at an elevation of 3380 feet. While this is nowhere near as high as the Lakes of the Clouds Hut or the Madison Springs Hut, which are both above 5000 feet, it would make today's climb shorter. 1.2 miles in fact. I took some pictures of the trail and the view of the Carter Notch Valley during my climb.
The trail was mostly wet today from all of yesterday's rain. The flat spots on the trail where dirt and debris collect were often puddled or muddy. However, most of the large flat rock surfaces that would have otherwise been problematic were dry.
Again, today the trail presented some of the most difficult climbs both up and down that I had encountered yet. This included steep cliff climbs up and down as well as wide open steep flat rock scrambles and boulder hopping.","Carter Notch Hut

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567962,"Today was the 26th anniversary of my wedding to Teresa. It was also a rest day that my body (particularly my knees) really needed. I watched a couple of movies with Jag Happy to relax and during part of the day I walked to the nearby Rattle River and sunbathed on some rocks while I read some more of Kurt Vonnegut's Sirens of the Titans.
It occurs to me that I forgot to mention in previous posts that we learned a couple days ago that there had been a rescue operation on the day we stayed at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut and were on Mount Washington. Apparently, a girl who was part of a school trip of 50 children and 5 teachers from Quebec had been left behind on the mountain and she was found later by a recovery team shaking violently. Story is that the teachers had left the kids separately and told them to just follow the white blazers, and this girl at some point had simply refused to keep going and separated from the rest of the group. She is lucky to be alive. They are very likely the same group that we saw when we were hiking on Mount Lafayette several days ago. If you look at the pictures I took there you'll see that some of them are with children and this is probably that group, though I do not know the identity of the girl who was rescued.
Redirect decided he needed to stick to his schedule, so he did not take a day off, and he proceeded on without Jag Happy and me. We will probably be in Maine the day after tomorrow. It's a little less than 16 miles to the NH/ME border, and that is doable in one day. However, shortly after that, about 21 miles from Gorham is Mahoosuc Notch, which is reputedly the most difficult one mile of the Appalachian Trail. So we plan to stop just short of the Mahoosuc Notch the day after tomorrow so that we can have fresh legs for that section of trail with a long day.","White Mountains Lodge and Hostel

We hiked over several un-named hills on relatively gentle terrain for a total of 11.8 miles.  Along the way, I saw a couple of interesting flowers (photos).
At about 4:30pm, we stopped for the day at Gentian Pond Shelter.  There is a pond, which empties through a beaver dam, into a small waterfall. There is also a nice view to the southwest where it looks like Mount Moriah and the Carters and Wildcats are visible. That is where we hiked on Tuesday and Wednesday.  (Pictures)","White Mountains Lodge and Hostel

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568122,"This morning after breakfast, Jag Happy and I left the Gentian Pond Shelter and headed back to the trail at about 7:45 a.m. Our first 7 miles or so was a hard, slow climb up New Hampshire's Mount Success.  I guess the name is appropriate since it is the last Mountain on the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire. We then climbed down to the actual Maine - New Hampshire border sign and took pictures.  
Not long thereafter we climbed through a very difficult, steep descent over large boulders and then arrived at the intersection of the trail to the Carlo Col Shelter.  As we came down through the boulder section, we met a couple who were working to section-hike the Appalachian Trail and towards that end were hiking all of the trails in the NH White Mountains.  Their dog Abby was too terrified to climb down over and through the big boulders, so we helped them get the dog through the tough section and chatted with them for a while at the bottom. They were headed back to their car, so they gave us water to carry us through to the next water source.
The remainder of our day was more up down up down up down. We had to climb up and over West Goose Eye Mountain, East Goose Eye Mountain and North Goose Eye Mountain. Then we came to Full Goose Shelter, stopping there for the night. This will allow us to take on Mahoosuc Notch after a one-mile warm-up tomorrow while we are relatively fresh. The Mahoosuc Notch section of the Appalachian Trail is reputedly the toughest one mile section of the entire Trail, so hopefully this will set us up for success.

But mostly you have to use upper body strength equally as much as lower, to hold on or push or pull yourself over under or around.
After completing this I high-fived with Jag Happy, because it was fun, exciting, and done!  But the climb up the Mahoosuc Arm, which was next, was physically harder than the Notch. So, we slogged through it and down the other side, to get to the beautiful Speck Pond and the campsite with the same name. Here, we stopped for the day and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon. I was able to repair my inflatable thermal mattress again, and I succeeded in demonstrating that it will also work as a personal flotation device. Haha. I used it to approximate a swim in the pond. When I realized I was blowing away to the other side of the pond, I swam back (this water was much warmer than the mountain streams I had come across so far on the trail, but still a bit too cold for an extended swim).","Full Goose Shelter

When he got back up, he could not locate his backpack, and in the process of searching trampled even more of the fragile alpine. When he asked Bluegrass for help in the search, he was met with a warning to stay out of the fragile alpine, but as you may guess, he ended up walking over more of it still.  Today when we saw him he agreed that yesterday he had, indeed been a basket case.

Today's hike was an easy enough part of the trail - little elevation gain/loss, muddy near ponds, lots of roots and rocks. But it was more like the trail I remember from before NH. Saw several sobo hikers.
Hit 1000 miles at some point before lunch, at mile 2023.4.  I stopped at mile 2024.6, at the West Carry Pond Lean-to for lunch. 6 southbound hikers were already there. Ate lunch. Chatted. Continued hiking.
Lots of sobos again. Around 1 pm, we came to a sandy beach. Met hikers Dazed (a 20-something guy), Confused (a dog), Birdie (another 20-something guy), and Toad (a 20-something woman) at the small beach. Here we decided to take an unscheduled break, so we swam and hung out about 15 min. 
Then continued hiking. 
3:30 ish, stopped to fill water (only available source was a puddle which may have been fed by a small spring)
Noticed that over the last 4 or 5 days there has been an increasing number of toads and frogs on the trail in and around the muddy areas.","Little Bigelow Lean-to

However, I awoke around 10 p.m. to the sound of what was probably the second loudest snoring I have ever heard. It was coming from Rick, one of the two other guys sleeping in the lean-to. I moved my sleeping bag out of the shelter and under the stars. (Well, under the branches of the tall pine trees around the lean-to.) Heard a loon or two on and off throughout the night.  
Got up about 4 am, with the sunlight and the birds.  It slowly began to drizzle about 4:30 am. Saw a nice red sunrise. On the west side of Pierce Pond, the sun shone on trees and reflected back an orange/red, and above there was a half rainbow (photo).  I may have missed this if not for the snoring.  Thanks, Rick! Beautiful. 
On the trail about 5:30 am.  Short walk along the waterfalls in the stream draining the pond into the Kennebec River.  At the river, waited for and then took the ""ferry"" (a canoe ride) to the other side of the river.

We waited for rain to end as predicted around 9:30 and then we (Jag Happy, Dr John and I) hiked out to the trail and headed north. The trail was relatively easy for the first 6 miles and we stopped at the Pleasant Find Lean-to for lunch. Then we hiked over the 2400 ft Pleasant Pond Mountain and to the base of Moxie Bald Mountain. We stopped at just under 15 miles for the day at the Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to.

Fords. The first was about knee deep, and only about 20ft wide. The second was deeper, wider, and the current was stronger. It was almost inseam - deep where I crossed, about 50 ft across, and swift enough that someone had installed a rope to tie off to (though we didn't need it).
We got to the Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to about 3 pm. Met another group of kids camping (Kieve). They hiked on.  We stayed. I set up, including with my bug net - the first time I used it in a shelter.  (Picture)

Long Pond lean to
Our first day in the 100 mile wilderness included 5 or 6 rivers four or five of which we had to Ford, meaning we had a choice between taking off our boots and socks and putting on water shoes, or in my case Crocs, or just crossing the river with your boots and socks on and dealing with wet feet the rest of the day. For the first three of these I did the former and dried my feet and put socks back on afterwards. However the trail itself was very wet from the rain we had on and off all day long and it was muddy. This caused me to eventually end up with completely wet boots and socks anyway. Therefore, at the end of the day, I simply left them on and waded through the last two crossings we had to do. the last of these was the most difficult of the day. It had the Swiftest current and with the recent rain the little River was swollen to about thigh deep. To make matters worse the rope someone had installed to help hikers cross was in the worst possible place, where the river was both deepest and had its fastest currents. That rope was also very frayed, and it would have been too easy for a hiker to get tangled up in pieces dangling off of it.
During the hike we crossed a few peaks and ledges from which I took a couple of pictures; the views were not that spectacular the interesting things in the scenery from my perspective was the combination of sunshine and threatening storm clouds which cycled back and forth for us all day long. At about 7 o'clock I got to the lean-to called Long Pond though the closest landmark was not in fact a pond, it was a beautiful waterfall through a slotted Canyon. At the lean to, I met at a group of hikers from a camp I can't remember the name of. The two leadrs were Laura and Collin. Laura was a 5' 4"" 20 something young woman with a nice smile and Colin was a 20 something 6 foot redhead male with apparent good leadership skills. I got to watch him give his campers a class on how to hang a bear bag. Dr John did not stop at the shelter with us but rather at in earlier can spot near the final River Crossing. He dislikes staying in shelters and with crowds. Jag happy and I met again hiker norm who we had seen on the trail earlier in the day and at Shaws hiker hostile in Monson the day before. In fact the three of us ate breakfast with norm that morning. Norm has a house in western New York but does not live there he was certified as a New York state park ranger and member the national Ski Patrol had some earlier point in his life. He also has done an extensive amount of long distance hiking including time on the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide trail. He said he got distracted for a while over the last couple of years and became addicted to white water rafting and was a guide for a white water rafting company for a couple years out west.","Monson, ME

Today jag happy and I said farewell to norm when he continued hiking North about 6 a.m. We then had breakfast and Dr John joined us about 6:30. Together we continued North about 6:50 and said farewell to Laura on the way out of the area around lean-to. She was the only one of the camp members up at that time. We hiked up Barren Mountain and found the trail to be relatively Pleasant compared to yesterdays wet slog and previous more difficult climbs we had had to do.
At several points, I stopped and took pictures of some panoramic scenery.   when we got to the top of Barren Mountain, i climbed and old firetower, and I took some more pictures of the surrounding to terrain from there. I stopped for lunch around 11:30 a.m. when everyone caught up we discussed the remainder of the day and said our sites on the chair back gap lean to as our destination.
The trail over the chair back mountains, which entailed up and down sections over 5 peaks, was rather difficult.  It was relatively steep. it was also wet and slippery.  Consequently we only had two total of 10 miles for the day. However when we got to the chair back gap lean too it was already full of southbound hikers. So we can't. I set up my tarp not far from the lean-to.  It started raining as soon as I had my tarp set up. I was able to stay dry underneath it. I also modified it so that I could run a clothesline inside it. I hung my wet socks and sweaty long sleeve shirt up on that clothesline to dry.","Long pond lean-to

We left the chair back gap area and hiked North starting around 7:25 a.m.  The trail was wet and muddy and because of all the rain last night the bushes and trees were full of water that dropped on me as I brushed against them at the side of the trail. The rocks were also slippery and I took a couple minor Falls during the day. We completed the climb over a chair back mountain. We had to Ford another River this was wider than the other rivers we had crossed so far but it was shallow and the current wasn't too bad so it was relatively easy. We continue taking and had a brief stuff for lunch at the Carl Newhall lean to. It was only 2 p.m. when we were there but the shelter was already starting to fill up with sobos who were claiming spots foot the night.  We continued hiking and passed another half dozen sobos headed for that lean-to.  We hiked over Gulf Hagas mountain amd down to the Sidney Tappan campsite.  There we stopped for the day.","Chairback gap lean-to

I am just south of Jo Mary Road in the wilderness. I plan to stop for the night at White's Landing. That is 31 miles from Baxter State Park or 40 miles from The Birches Campground, which is where the Katahdin climb begins.
Sunny at the moment, after nearly three days of almost continuous rain.  Fun!”
Should get easier now, and we've been hiking pretty quickly today. Looks right now like we'll arrive at the Birches Campsite on the 5th. That will give us an opportunity to summit on the 6th.  (+/- a day -- should be able to refine the estimate tonight and then finalize the plan when we get to Abol Bridge (start of Baxter Park). Will go to airplane mode for most of the day, as my phone is at 16% power.

In the interim I spent some time in Maine visiting my friends the Bowes,  I visited family in Northern York, I attended a wedding in West Virginia, and I did a lot of chores around the house in Northern Virginia.
I had planned to head south next from Harpers Ferry and do the rest of the Appalachian Trail. However I have now decided to hike North from the Killington area in order to complete the remainder of the Long Trail In Vermont first. 
Today my father was kind enough to give me a ride from Chazy New York to Killington Vermont, and I checked in at the Inn at Long Trail. Tomorrow morning I will hike North from here in order to complete the 165 miles of the Long Trail that I have not yet hiked. I completed 105 miles of the Long Trail in April as the southernmost 105 miles of the Appalachian Trail in Vermont coincide with the long trail.
After checking in,  I hung out at the Inn for the majority of the afternoon and I met several other hikers. These were all Appalachian Trail hikers mostly northbound but there were a couple of sobos. The first of these were Captain Jack and Cadicus.  While driving on Route 4 before checking into the Inn at Long Trail I stopped with my dad to offer a ride to these two hikers who were standing on the side of the road in the rain. I saw them again later when they stopped for lunch at the inn.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573192,"After breakfast at the inn at long trail I went out to route 4 and at the northeast end of the inn parking lot I picked up the Sherburne Trail and headed up the hill. In 0.8 miles I reached the intersection with the Appalachian Trail where I headed south. Although this was the same train I had hiked in May I had difficulty recognizing the landmarks. In his particular area there are numerous side trails that intersect with the Appalachian Trail and both the Appalachian Trail and the long trailer Mark with white Blazers. Anyway I headed south on the Appalachian Trail and around 930 I came to Maine Junction where I turned right to head north on the long trail. Pictures. 
On the Sherburne trail I didn't see anyone else but while I was headed south on the Appalachian Trail I ran across at least a dozen northbound Appalachian Trail hikers which included 3 of the folks I had met at the inn. This was Zeus, flash fire, and a guy from Augusta Georgia who is trail name I have forgotten and who my head just met this morning have prior to enduring breakfast.
It was raining slowly but steadily though the overhead canopy of leaves did block most of the downfall so with body heat generated by hiking I was able to stay relatively dry. The temperature was in the high 50's maybe 60 degrees. And the ground was damp and muddy but it was obstructed by deep mud and puddles only in places.   The rocks on the trail of course were wet and slippery.The long trail North of Maine Junction appeared to be fairly well maintained.
Around 10:30 I crossed elbow Road which is a gravel road leading to Pittsfield to the east. In many places from that point North word I noticed sign indicating that a private nearby landowner had timber rights on the land around the long trail. These science caution hikers to be on the lookout for falling and fallen trees and to be cautious around the places where timber is skated across the trail.
Sometime before 11:30 I came to the Ralston rest shelter and decided to stop for a snack break. I that point I had hike 1.4 miles to get from the N at long trail to the Maine Junction and 3.8 miles of long trail north bound to get to the shelter. That was 5.2 miles an 2 hours and 45 minutes, or an average speed of 1.9 miles per hour. I did not want to go much faster than that for a number of reasons. First the wet and slippery trail conditions. Second it was the first day back on the trail after a to week break. Third my pack included a full food bag. And 4th I was breaking in a new pair of boots. During my two weeks off I had purchased a pair of keen low top non waterproof hiking shoes.  I was still experimenting with how I wanted to tie the shoes.
Shortly before my break at the Ralston shelter I met a southbound like her who was just doing a short section and shortly after my break at the shelter I met a hiker who was doing the long trail South bound.
At about 1:45 p.m. and about 3/2 miles south of the David Logan shelter the long trail joined Vermont Appalachian snowmobile trail. I took pictures of a couple of the signs indicating this.
I reached the David Logan shelter at about 3:30 p.m. that was my intended destination for the day so I stopped and refill all my water bottles but as I was preparing for dinner hi realized it was really too early for that and I had not eaten lunch. So I ate a tuna salad tortilla at a late lunch instead. As I would doing so pair of hikers arrived from the north they were a man in his life 5460 Sand what appear to be his daughter or young woman and her twenties. They had psyched South from the sunrise shelter 6 and a half miles to the north. The man said that they did not do long distance is a hike only shelter to shelter and the girl said that it wasn't easy trail that they had done in 4 hours today at the very slow pace that she likes. As I was talking to them I decided to try to press on and see if I could reach the sunrise shelter before dark. Otherwise it appeared that the weather was improving.
So I figured that if it appeared I would not make it all the way to the next shelter I would have a option to stealth camp. So I treated one and a half liters of the water I have collected. I dumped the other later so as not to have to carry the extra 2 pounds. & I hiked up the .2 mile blue trail back to the long trail from the shelter and headed north again.
The Sun begin to poke through blue holes in the grace guy sometime in the late afternoon and as it started setting in the evening I could see it shining through the trees and the water still dripping off the leaves sparkled in the sunlight. I arrived at the sunrise shelter about 6:50 p.m. and I had the shelter to myself. I setup my stuff for the night, changed into dryer clothing, and made dinner and tea before wrapping things up for the night and going to bed.  For dinner, I had a burrito with fajita chicken from packit gourmet the freeze dried food company that Dorothy recommended. It was excellent. Just like eating a Chipotle burrito.  I had no cellular coverage so I was unable to upoload my trail journal. I guess that'll have to wait until tomorrow.

I woke around 430 but waited for a little more daylight and the sound of the birds before I got up. It seems that between a small difference and latitude and a small progression past summer solstice it is getting later a little later. I had to use my headlamp during the initial part of breaking camp. I'll ever by the time I had my ID sleeping bag packed up and was ready to cook a little oatmeal there was enough light to see without the assistance of my headlamp.
I left the sunrise shelter shortly after 6 o'clock and shortly before 6:30 came to the first place and which I could actually see out over surrounding train. Yesterday of course if it been cloudy rainy and foggy but the foliage had also been so dance that there was just no place to see anything other than the trail and the forest around me. So this morning I was able to look out at what a nearby sign identified as great cliffs and Mount horrid.
The last 4 miles or so the trail yesterday as well as this initial part of the trail this morning were very easy abroad flat trail bed which was probably one say road of some kind was well maintained. In several places they were even well constructed wouldn't bridges providing nice flat River crossings with a railing and everything. However when approaching these bridges on the trail I saw sign posts that warned slow bridge ahead. The bridges themselves also head reflective warning markers on the corners of the railings. At first I thought this was to warn snowmobiles and/or all terrain vehicle drivers, who should not have been riding such vehicles on the foot traffic only trail. However my impression changed after i discovered that the flat wooden surface of the wide boards of which the bridges consisted, particularly when damp, was as slippery as ice.  I didn't break anything and I didn't fall in the river but I did spend my wheels like a cartoon character and end up so I don't my stomach.
Yesterday in today I also saw on one or both sides of the trail a dentist growth of the stinging Nettles that my siblings and I had called saw blades when I was growing up. Based on childhood experience I was careful to avoid skin contact with these plants. Picture. I was not entirely successful.
At about 6:45 I arrived at Brandon gap and Vermont route 73. I head a narrow window of his ability to the west going to 73 and took a picture. And then I crossed and re entered the long trail North. As I pushed through the dense brush that line the path that the trailhead I pause to eat a wild raspberry. 
 Shortly before 1030 I started to sensei hotspot on the bottom of go on my left foot. I thought about waiting until I would drive at the sucker Brook shelter week I estimated was close by. However I thought I should deal with this right away so I stopped to cough my sock and put a piece of duct tape around the big toe on my left foot. Then I continued on, and shortly thereafter i arrived at a small Brook, so I stopped to fill up on water, on which I was running short.  While I waited for my aqua mirror water treatment to be ready I applied some insight repellent which I had not needed up to this point because of the relatively cold temperature and yesterday's rain. I also check my gut hook up and determined that I was only a few hundred feet from the sucker Brooke shelter where I had intended to stop for a snack and had anticipated reaching at around 10:30! So I had my snack then and afterward pack up my water and proceeded onto the shelter right checked in only two sign a log book.
I reached the top of worth Mountain around 11:45 and there I'm at to southbound hikers who work waiting for to friends who had not cut up with them yet. They appear to be in there 61 was a professor of anthropology at the University of Vermont. His trail name was flash and his real name Rob. I didn't not get a name or trail name from the other gentleman. We talked about a number of things for about a half and hour.
Before I left to continue North they asked me to tell their friends that they were waiting for them. I did that when I encountered them one at a time between 5 and 10 minutes later. By the way another interesting fact about Rob is that he offered a book about law war and conflict. He claimed to have been two more than 50 Wars.
How about 12:30 I came up on another group of 3 hikers who were eating lunch at a spot from which it was possible to see out to the west so I joined the momentarily and took a picture. 2 of them were men whgo appeared to be in their forties and the other was a woman who appeared to be in her early thirties. The men were from State College Pennsylvania and Iowa and the woman was from Los Angeles. They were part of a group doing work for the National Park Service at a park nearby and head just taken the day off to climb in the battell wilderness.
At 1 p.m. I crossed the top of the chair lift running down to the east at Middlebury Snowbowl ski area. Pictures. At about 1:30 p.m. I cross the top of another chair left running down hill to the west. At the bottom of this I could see some buildings. Picture. Shortly after that I reached route 125 and Middlebury gap.
I arrived at the Boyce shelter about 3:30 p.m. I stopped there to have a late lunch and decided to move on at least as far as the Emily Proctor shelter another three point seven miles.  After lunch, I filled and treated a liter and a half of water and then I continued North up the trail.
Shortly after 5 o'clock I arrived at the turnoff for the blue trail to the skyline Lodge. This is a beautiful and close. Maintained by the Green Mountain Club with a terrific view of the skyline pond blow it. I went that way not so much to see the view of pond but because Mount Moosilake is visible far in the distance to the east. I took a picture and I think if you look closely you can see the faint grey shadow significantly larger than anything around ish. There were three hikers at the skyline Lodge. This was a man in a woman and there late thirties early forties and what a pretty to be there daughter around 10 years old we had put in conversation about the long trail in the Appalachian Trail for a few minutes and then I return to the long trail and continued North.","Sunrise shelter
",Emily Proctor shelter,"Jul 26, Wed",17.80
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573391,"It rained all night last night and the wind blew. This made it difficult for me to get continuous sleep but I was very glad to have shelter and not be getting my gear all wet. I woke at 5 o'clock in the morning but when I looked at the blowing mist outside the shelter and heard the rain still falling I decided to sleep a little longer. So I actually got out of my sleeping bag and slowly started getting ready for the day around 6:30. I made oatmeal coffee for breakfast and treated some more water and reviewed my map. After breakfast I packed up and actually got going on the trail about 8:15 a.m.
Well my gear was not soaking wet, the things I have worn yesterday we're all sweaty and my socks and boots had gotten wet because of the amount of water on the trailer self. These things did not get directly rained on during the night but although I hung them on a line to dry there is no drying and air that is obviously over saturated. So everything was still damp in the morning I chose to wear a damp long sleeve shirt which was what I had Warren on Tuesday because today appeared to be cooler than yesterday and I chose to wear my rain gear as well. It took awhile to get warmed up as a headed up the trail since I was pretty much sore and stiff everywhere after 2 days of strenuous hiking through areas of fairly decent elevation gain and loss.
I was glad to have my rain gear on as it was impossible to avoid contact with the vegetation on both sides of the trail and this was soaked with water. It was no longer actually raining but the wind was still blowing water off of the higher tree branches as well. The day started with a steep climb and soon enough I was a top mount Wilson.
Then I descended the other side and around 9:45 I was at the summit of Mount Roosevelt. From here I found an overlook with a fantastic view to the south and despite the clouds, there was enough visibility that I could see most of the surrounding Valley including Mountain Wilson to the south where I had just been.
Just before noon it started raining again in Ernest I was already wet from water on the foliage so this didn't really make any difference. Right about noon I arrived at the Cooley Glen shelter. Pictures. I stopped, rung out my wet shirt, and had lunch. I decided to go on and try to reach the Battell shelter, 7 more miles today.  I put my raincoat back on as I had started to get a chill well sitting in doing lunch I signed the log book and then I headed out about 12:45.  I had just under 1 liter of water but ironically with all the water coming out of the sky there were no documented water sources between here and the next shelter. So my one liter would have to suffice or I would have to find a way to collect some run off.
 I was glad that I stopped for lunch today and I was energized afterwards and reached the summit of grant Mountain about 10 past 1 p.m. about 1 mile in 25 minutes or faster than 2 miles per hour uphill all the way. This was a dark contrast to the way I had felt this morning and yesterday afternoon. I think waiting until 3 p.m. to take a lunch break yesterday while trying to hike for and fast really kind of wore me out. This afternoon felt different but in the interest of not repeating just today's situation by deliberately backed off on my level of effort.
I am concerned about how I'm going to get my mail drop in Jonesville. The post office has hours of 12:45 to 4:45 on Friday that's tomorrow. It also is open 8:30 to 10 a.m. on Saturday. It is close otherwise. I am currently about 35 miles from Route 2. So I can't get there tomorrow. I don't think I can get close enough tomorrow to be able to get to the post office before 10 a.m. on Saturday. I call the Post Office to see what my options might be but the lady I spoke with was a by-the-book person although she was trying to be helpful.
About 1:45 I meant to southbound hikers. The first was a young woman in her 30s in a Yellow Rain. The second was an older gentleman probably in his sixties wearing shorts and a white synthetic t-shirt. He stopped to talk to me for a while.
He did not explain their relationship but he said that when they reach Killington they will have completed the Long Trail. I explained my progress toward Long Trail end-to-end as well as my AT hike. He said that they live south of the Shenandoah Park and they do Trail maintenance there. He invited me to contact him at Marktrails@gmail.com when I get in that area.
About 230 near the meadows I am at a big black dog and then a young woman with a small Camelback day pack in her thirties. I said hello and she said hey how you doing? I said jokingly well the wolf scared me a little bit and she said yeah I get that a lot. We stopped and talked for a few minutes. She and her dog are in the process of taking the 5 big Peaks on the long trail. She had hiked mount Ellen earlier today and was headed towards Mountain Abraham where I had been yesterday. We told each other good luck and then I continued northbound.
The Meadows itself was on remarkable. Just a couple of clearing send some open rock face., not far from there I came to sunset ledge which was impressive. I could not see anything sir the fog be on the ledge but it was obvious that going over would be a long fall. From there the terrain got more rugged in fact on both sides of Lincoln gap which was shortly ahead the terrain was the most difficult I had encounter yet on a long trail.
I reached Lincoln Gap at about 315 p.m. after I was about a half-mile up the other side toward Mount Abraham the girl with the dog caught up with me from behind as I was stopping with my pack to remove my raincoat. They have been trying to reach Mount Abraham and had accidentally been going the wrong way up the southside of Lincoln cab instead of the North. I continue to climb and at about 4:45 p.m. I reached the battell shelter where I refilled my water bottles I also applied some Neosporin to a couple of chafing spots that had been irritated by The Continuous sweaty wetness of yesterday's hike. I wondered about why in what was now 1200 miles of  hiking I hadn't had this problem before. I guess I had not been hiking so hard on terrain that was so difficult and whether that was so warm.
I continued toward the summit of mt Abraham and about a quarter mile from the peak I meant the girl and the dog again. They were headed back down to Lincoln gap after summitting Matt Abraham. This time I learned that the dog's name was moose and the girl did not have a trail name yet; so I suggested moose's mom and she seem to like that. After a few more minutes so pleasant conversation we continued our hike and at about 5:15 I reached the summit of Mount Abraham. I paused only for a moment to look around there was a small Alpine vegetation area there. I continue it on and a few minutes later I met a South going caretaker who is tent I had seen near the battell shelter. She asked where I was going to stop for the night and I told her either Glen Ellen Lodge, stark's nest, or theron dean shelter, though I realized I'd be hiking with a headlamp as those spots were between 5 and 7 miles and it would be dark in an hour and a half or two. She recommended not staying at the Glen Ellen Lodge because it's .3 miles off the trail down a very slippery slope. She also said that Starks Nest is only a mile further and would be very nice place to stay. And she said that on Mount Ellen which was 3 miles ahead at the time there is a ski patrol Hut for the Mad River Glen ski area that I could use as a bailout if I decided not to keep going past that point. I asked her about her job as a caretaker and learned that it's a summer job for which she is paid a little more than minimum wage. I thanked her for doing it and we wished each other well and I continued on my way. Later I took a picture of one of the water Bar trenches she had told me she was proud to have finished.
At about 6 p.m. I reached Lincoln Peak which is the top of one of the chair lifts of the Sugarbush Ski Resort. I took some pictures and was lucky enough to capture a view of to the east well there was a very brief break in the clouds. Then I continue North.  About 6:30 I came to the top of the Castle Rock chairlift another part of the Sugarbush Ski Resort.
I took a picture of a trail sign indicating the directions of a number of black diamond and Double Black Diamond ski trails. I had some difficulty figuring out which way the Long Trail went but eventually I was able to follow it down the Middle Earth Trail until it went back into the woods at quarter-mile later. Sometime later during my Ascent of Mount Ellen I heard thunder. Not just once but several times and it like it was just a head and maybe coming closer. I checked the weather app on my phone and then my radar app. The radar showed a distinct Red Storm cell headed directly for the little blue dot which indicated my location. I considered my situation. I could continue forward and tried to climb over Mount Ellen and out of the way but that would put me at high elevation directly in the path of the storm. I could try to go back and shelter in the ski patrol Hut I had passed about nine tenths of a mile earlier but the track of the storm on my radar app seemed to show the center of the storm would pass over that spot. I checked the elevation profile for the terrain I was hiking and determined that going back would not bring me down significantly but going forward would bring me up significantly. So I chose to Simply get off the trail and shelter in the woods. I hastily rigged my tarp between two trees and sat underneath it to get out of the rain that hit intensified with the arrival of the storm. This was around 7:15 p.m. I estimated given the progress of the storm sale shown on my radar app over the last hour that it would pass by my location by 7:45. I patiently just sat and listened to the Thunder until it seemed farther away to the South East. Then I gathered my stuff back together put my tarp back in my pack and continued hiking.
It got dark  about  an hour later.  Or I should say dark enough that I had to use my headlamp to see adequately.  I don't remember what time it was that I got to Stark's Nest ski patrol Lodge at the top of Stark Mountain bat the Mad River Glen ski area, but it was after 9 p.m. and it was dark. Shortly before I got there I met another Northbound hiker who was hiking with a headlamp. I learned after we both got to start Nest that this was Laurent from Montreal Canada. He is an ultra marathon runner and has recently picked up fast packing. Today he hiked 34 miles. We both said stuff out to dry inside the ski patrol Hut at the top of Mad River Glen ski area that is known as Stark's nest. And I set up my sleeping bag got some water and cooked a freeze dried dinner. This was a Paleo meals to go Savory chicken something or other. I was not impressed. I was however filled and I made a cup of tea to top off a nice dinner. A long day.","Emily Proctor shelter
",Stark's nest,"Jul 27, Thu",19.70
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573489,"I had a nice dry cozy night at the Starks nest ski patrol Lodge at the top of General Stark Mountain at the Mad River Glen ski area. In the morning I got up when Laurent did. He ate and packed and got on the trail at 5:30 as it got light. It was still blowing Cloud outside but my weather application indicated it should be sunny by 9 a.m. this morning. I took my time getting ready and by the time I was ready to leave at 6:30 the sun had come out. At least it was clear here at the top of Stark Mountain I could see lots of clouds still in the surrounding area over other Terrain but it did look like it was going to be a nice day. I took some pictures before I left to get on the trail headed north.
The trail down the north side of stark Mountain was quite rugged with rebar ladders and steep Rock faces. Pictures. I reached the throne Dean shelter sometime between 7 and 7:30. It had exceptionally nice views from North northeast to South South East. More pictures.
I reached route 17 and the Appalachian gap around 8:30 a.m. Pictures. I stopped there briefly to sign in the register and change out of my long sleeve shirt into a short sleeve shirt. Both were damp but the smart wool of the long sleeve shirt with starting to irritate my skin under my shoulder straps. I also stayed  for moment and headed drink of water.  Just before 1030 I arrived at the birch Glen Lodge which is a shelter with a little bit more liberal construction been average and it has a caretaker nearby so you have to pay $5 a night to stay here. I stayed only to have a snack and a drink of water and sign the log book.
About noon I stopped at the Cowles Cove shelter for lunch. Here I also took off my boots and socks and dried I'm in the Sun for about a half an hour while I ate lunch.  I also cleaned my feet and put on some aunti-fungal cream. Then I also filled and treated another leader of water. I'll together this was about a 1 hours stop and I felt rested when I started hiking North again.
Burnt Mountain followed by ladder ravine followed by Mount Ethan Allen. Very difficult to rain some of the most exciting and scary hiking I have ever done. On the way down Mount Ethan Allen toward the next shelter I'm at southbound day hiker Marika. She works at a therapeutic survivalist program for teenagers whose parents send them there. We had an interesting conversation and then set our fair walls and when under way.
I reached the Montclair Glen shelter at about 4:15 p.m. I stopped and had a snack and some water and decided to continue. I wanted to get over camels hump and at least two the Bamford shelter. That's 5.2 miles from the Montclair going Lodge but its also only about 3 miles from route to wear I needed to go tomorrow to get my email drop from the Jonesville post office which is only open from 8:30 a.m. till 10 a.m. on Saturdays and its closed on Sundays so if I miss that timing window have to wait till Monday when it is open from 12:45 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
6:15ish I reached the summit of camel's hump.  Windy, sunny, 360 degree panorama. Awesome!  Exhilarating, even scary. At 6:30 ish on the way down from camels hump I felt a hotspot on it outside of my right heel. So I stopped and put a piece of duct tape on it. I guess the constant wetness its off my skin made it more susceptible to blistering.
I got to the shelter at bamforth Ridge just before dark. I decided I wanted to be closer to the post office so I kept going. I walked all the way down to the parking lot at Duxbury Road and then turn left and follow the road. Along the way I saw a bear about twice my size outside one of the residences along the road. The bear notice to me and when I turned to look at it and shine my headlight at it inadvertently it decided to run away. I didn't even think to try to take a picture but it was too dark anyway.
At about 10:20 I thought I found a place to camp at the Camels Hump State Park. However when I check closer there were warning signs indicating that it had just been treated yesterday with a chemical herbicide in order to kill an invasive plant species.I went further down the road and found a place to camp. I setup my tarp there for the night.","Stark's nest

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573573,"This morning I got up around 5 at my stealth camp. I made breakfast including the Tuscan beef stew dinner I had not had a chance to eat tonight before. I packed up my stuff, taking my time about it, and I started walking toward route 2 at about 6:45.  After I got to root 2, I turned left and walked about a mile to Jonesville where I stopped at the post office and sat on the curb and waited for it to open.
About 745 the lady I had talked to a couple days ago a ride and ask if I was the hiker who had called. I said yes and she said okay you can come in now you don't have to wait for 830. I got my package sorted its contents into my food bag and try to figure out how to get to a laundromat and a place to stay in town tonight but I could not find a cab that would come pick me up and Jonesville. Apparently they were old busy shoveling people to some big Vermont level event. The Clerk of the post office said she thought it was a big beer fest. I also couldn't find in affordable room for lodging the cheapest available anywhere nearby was a Fairfield by Marriott Hotel in Waterbury 8 miles away that would cost $256 for one night so I chose not to stay there.
I did find a good laundromat available in Waterbury so I tried to hitchhike there I got a ride part way and got dropped off at a store where I bought some triple A batteries for my headlamp. Then I tried to hit check the rest of the way to Waterbury but after a half an hour I decided not to do that. So turnaround started walking back toward the trailhead and that about 9 o'clock I gotta ride and those going to have a guy drop me at the trailhead but he was headed to grocery store so I went with him and bought a couple things for my food bag myself. Then he took me to the trailhead and I started hiking about 1030.
Climbing up out of the route to get was arduous but I had decided only to go about 6 miles to the first shelter. On the way I stopped and ate some lunch and took a couple of break. At about 1:15 p.m. I thought I heard Thunder in the distance off to the left of the trailer head as I was climbing up toward mount Bolton. Then I realized the sound with two regular. It was a combination of short bursts  of machine gun fire. Arrived at Buchanan lodge about 2:30 p.m.

Adam and I set up tents and chose an extra spot for  paul and Kate. However later we learned that Paul and Kate stopped at the Madonna Mountain warming hot and stayed there.
Later just before dark Stephanie showed up and told us that she had actually accidentally gone the wrong direction and had to come back so she was staying here; she took one of the tent spaces we had chosen - the one that would have been for paul and Cait. We set up and had dinner, and Stephanie said that the following day she would be happy to give us a ride to the town of Johnson in her truck (our angel).

This was his fourth time on the Appalachian Trail. He had complete today through hike in 2014. This time he had started from Harpers Ferry in June and made it as far as Hanover New Hampshire. Then because he had a little less than a month before his return flight to Ireland from Washington DC he decided to return to Harpers and hike south and then back to Harpers before returning home.
After crossing the river which I noted was flowing North to meet the Potomac which was coming from the west and would join in a confluence that the northern tip of Harpers Ferry, I started the steep southbound to sent the wrestling and the south side of the river. At the top of this the trail level out but was rocky like I remembered Maryland and Pennsylvania. I took a picture.
Today was also my first day hiking with my new Footwear. During my break I got a pair of Altra Superior 3 Trail runners. I also got a pair of solid black dirty girl gaiters. I had considered getting one of the fancier patterns of which their selection has hundreds. However in the end I opted for them or subdued approach. Picture.
Around noon I met northbound section hiker Sofacco ( he had spent time Lesotho, Africa, and that name means hey Lynn some African language).  He was 57 and had long ash strongly hair and a beard that was mostly white. He also said that he was vegan and was planning on catching a bus in or near her purse Ferry to a town with a grocery store so that he could restock is food. After a little more pleasant conversation we bid each other farewell and happy Trails, and I continued south.
Sometime after 1:30 p.m. I reached the David lesser memorial shelter. Cuckoo was already there and was wrapping up as I arrive we chatted really before she left and then I ate a snack and drink some water. I wasn't really all that hungry and income from two weeks of well fed him off the trail. I signed a log book after lunch and then headed south again what are the 3 miles to go for the day. My new shoes feel good on my feet but my feet self tired as I reached the 10 mile marker for the day and I took it easy as I continued.
I arrived at the Blackburn trail Center around 3:20 ish. Cuckoo was already there.  We chatted for a while, waiting for the caretaker to get there.  Later as one of two people working on the building was leaving, he told us the caretaker should be there sometime I  the evening and to make ourselves comfortable I  the bunkhouse or on the porch of the main building.  We chose the latter.  I showered off the sweat of the day in a solar shower when I discovered it.
Later, about 530pm, Ireland showed up. We all ate dinner, and soon it was bed time."," Harper's Ferry Town's Inn

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575457,"I got up a couple times during the night. Sleeping on the porch was rolls of the comfortable and the rain that fell outside did not disturb any of us on the porch. The forest was quite loud with the sound of insects. These were sick a test and other such large bugs. Ireland said that it one point during the night he had heard it rattle coming from under the boards of the porch being answered by a similar rattle coming from somewhere in the forest. He said he knew this couldn't be a rattlesnake but couldn't figure out what it was. Cuckoo evidently had not heard the same thing. She had heard some other kind of animal in the morning making a ""cooing"" sound. I think I heard the same thing but neither of us could figure out what that was. Probably some kind of bird I guess. I got up around 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom and I had a glass of the lemonade that the caretaker had left at the trail Center for us. I also stretched. I was muscular lease or from yesterday's hike despite the relative ease of it. I actually got up around 5:30 a.m. when I heard Ireland and cuckoo discussing the sound of the rattle. I sit on the porch steps for a while and watched the sunrise. The sky was partly cloudy and the Sun itself was not directly in view because of the trees but there was a little color as the Sun came up.
I went through morning routine and a breakfast my one modification of the routine today was that I mixed instant coffee packets in Coldwater in my 20 ounce water bottle and drink it that way instead of just pouring the dried grounds into my mouth and swallowing them with sips of water. It was much better this way. I told cuckoo that this was in parked do to her reaction when I had described the dry coffee grounds message yesterday and that today I felt like an evolved Pokemon.
The three of us discussed various options for destinations today ranging from an 8 mile hike to the Bears den hospital. I shared that this was one of jag Happy's recommended stopping spots. Ireland also said that that was probably as far as he wanted to go today cuckoo sounded interested but wasn't sure and I was someone inclined to think about trying to reach maybe as far as the rod hollow shelter 18 miles south. In between those objectives was another shelter and a few camp sites. I what is the first to start hiking this morning and I actually left the trail Center building about 7:30. However it took me a while to find the right path on the blue trail back to the Appalachian Trail so it was actually around 8 a.m. when I was actually walking on the Appalachian Trail itself. I had itself at a slow pace trying to ease into myself bound hike.
At the Blackburn trail Center there head been posters warning of the lime disease threat. I noticed that unlike in New York New Jersey and New England where the primary threats head been from dear ticks, here the posters said it was the black leg tick that we needed to be concerned about. I thought about this as I was walking South trying to stay in the center of the trail as the posters head advised and I noticed that there was a sizable grassy margin on both sides of the trail as it past between the trees and the other wise leaf covered Forest floor. This would probably be good tick Habitat, and I decided that I would put on some insight repellent at my next stop. At 9 o'clock when I took a brief water break I did that.
At the trail Center I head also weighed my backpack. It was 36 pounds with a3 day supply food and one liter of water which means that yesterday when I left her purse very it would have been probably 3 pounds heavier. At 3940 pounds its too much. I knew that this was in part do to my choice to carry a second pair of foot care. And bottom of my pack and I had a pair of a6 rugged running shoes that I was comfortable wearing. This was in case my new trail runners didn't work out or failed to soon. So that was a couple of pounds of the way right there I also knew that my choice to continue to carry to external spare recharging batteries for my phone was another Factor that was in part responsible.
I had also added a couple rolls of medical and antiblister tape to my first aide ziplock bag. And I had purchased a new lightweight windbreaker. also I had added a tube of sunscreen that I had previously cut from my packing list. In any case, i recognized that I would need to revisit some of these choices in the near future in order to lighten my load.
Sometime around 9:30 I reached the northern edge of the section of the AT known as the roller coaster. I took a photo of the sign indicating this. About 10 o'clock I reached the Raven Rocks viewpoint which was a cliff overlooking would've Valley with a nice view of a nearby town off to the west. Picture.
Sometime after 11:30 I came to a Road intersection where the trail crossed both have to lane road and it for lane road. The two lane road is evidently called Pine Grove Road and the four lane was label Harry Byrd Highway.  As I got to the other side of this which was also labeled route 7 I saw a hike her who was in his 30 is coming up behind me and I waited for him. He was the same guy I had just passed about 10 minutes earlier north of the intersection. At that point he had said that he was waiting for a friend he was hiking with to catch up. Evidently now he was going back and he said he was going to try to find her. As we headed up to the trail on the south side of Route 7 it came to a trail intersection whereas I'd pass went down to a parking lot and he said he was going that way to look for her. However he also said that he thought she had continued up where I was headed to the Bears den hospital. So he went left and I continued straight and upward. About 10 minutes later I passed a young woman going the other direction and I asked her if she was hiking with a guy in a white t-shirt and she said yes and I explained where he had gone and that he was trying to link up with her. She said thank you and with half a smile said that she was really in a foul mood. Evidently there have been some miscommunication between the two of them and it looked like a lot of extra hiking was happening as a consequence. I should well I hope you're have a nice day anyway and she left a little and said yet thanks you too as we parted ways. I continued up the hill southbound.
Just past noon, I arrived at the bears den hostel.  The hiker room was locked and the front door had a sign that said ""closed -- open at 5pm"" when I called, a lady explained that there were instructions on the back door.  I looked and saw ""to open the door, use an AT guide book.  The code is the number of miles between route 55 Manassas gap, amd the bears den hostel.   Enter three three- digit number.""  Evidently my guide book wad okc by 0.1 mile,  but when she saw me trying with a number that was close,  she leaned out a window amd have me the right #.
I changed and dried my sweaty stuff on the clothes line. Then I had lunch.  I did not intend to stop here for the day, but because we jag talked about it this morning, I felt I should tell Ireland and cuckoo before moving on.  I also checked weather sand my radar app showed a front coming in -- possible thunderstorms.  At 2pm neither of them had showed up, so i started hiking south again. I goy about a half mile,  then I changed my mind and went back.   Ireland was there, but out seemed cuckoo had moved on.  I decided to stay.  I took a shower and relaxed.","Blackburn trail center

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575641,"After eating pizza ice cream and soda as part of the hiker package at the Bears den hostile last night I slept well. How is asleep by 9 p.m. but then I was wide awake at about 3:45 a.m. I tried to sleep a little longer but decided to get up and get ready for the day anticipating that it would be the light about 5:30 a.m. and that upstairs the hospital offered make your own all you can eat pancake breakfast. So I got up I went upstairs I made coffee and pancakes. I made a lot of Pancakes. I ate a lot of Pancakes. But I did not eat all of the pancakes I made a left 3 for whoever would get up next and then I went back downstairs to finish getting ready. I was completely packed and ready to go at 5:30 but to my surprise it was not light. So I went back upstairs and had another cup of coffee and read a journeys magazine produced by Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Has it was approaching 6 a.m. it was still completely dark outside but I knew it couldn't stay dark much longer so I went downstairs rounded up my gear and after one more stop in the restroom I hit the trail after a playing some insect repellent. I guess the change in latitude from Vermont to Virginia and a small progression further past mid summer had a more substantial impact on Sunrise timing than I had anticipated. It was light enough to see when I actually got on the trail by 6 o'clock but that was about a half an hour later than that hit been getting light when I was in Vermont. Further when I had been in Maine in early July it had been getting light enough to see between 4:30 and 5 a.m...
As I continue to hike southbound into the more defined to rain of the roller coaster I noted a lot of Wildlife in the early morning. I saw the tales of at least for deer and 1 barrel running away from the sound of my approach. The bear was visible for only a second but that is number 5 seen on my truck so far. At about 7:30 I reached the Sam more shelter and I stopped and just to sign the log book and then continued hiking southbound.
About 8:30 as I was crossing a stream I was reminded to stay hydrated so I took a short break and drink some water. Some quickly turned into a half a liter and after five minutes of rest I was three quarters it will leader down so I decided to go ahead and refill that bottle while I was at a water source. I prepared my aquamira solution and finished drinking the remainder of my first leader of water for the day and then refill the bottle from the Stream. When the solution was ready I treated the water and then I packed up and continue taking southbound.
 Just before 9 I crossed Morgans Mill Road and there I saw a large number of cars. Nearby was a large number of people with a large number of dogs preparing for day hikes. I continued Southbound.
Around 1030 I arrived at the rod Hollow shelter. And that indicated that I had also past the southern and of the roller coaster about 3/10 of them mile earlier. That represented 10 miles of hiking in about four and a half hours including break time. Even with the elevation gain loss of the roller coaster I have her space had been better than 2.2 miles an hour. I guess the pancakes with syrup on top of pizza and ice cream from the night before he deserves to car Bologna pretty well. However again since I did not want to overdo it early in myself bound hike I really didn't want to be going any faster than that. I stopped at the rod hello shelter long enough to have a snack and sign the log book and then I continued south.
Write about noon I crossed us route 50 which at this point is evidently also us Route 17. Four lanes of high speed traffic passing east west through the Ashby gap. I noticed that just a few miles south of this point I would be passing through and crossing trails to and from sky meadow State Park. 450 South climbed up and noticed that the sides of the trail had been weed whacked. Given the tick threat I appreciate it this. About 1230 I came to and opened field across with stay trail past well continuing to slope gradually upward.
In the middle of this field where number of sign post indicating the crossing of a number of trails. These seemed to have level of difficulty markings on them and iPod to take a few pictures before continuing to hike south.
After I passed through the sky meadow State Park area at about 1:30 I saw a trail maintain ur. He was wearing shorts and a t-shirt gloves and a baseball hat with sunglasses and he was carrying to tools for cutting grass and branches. I stopped and thank him and told him that I had noticed his work as I was climbing up the hill and that I appreciate it it. He said we try. And he let me take his picture. Shortly thereafter I saw another maintainer with a weed wacker and I thanked her as well. Picture.
Shortly before 2 p.m. I arrived at the dicks dome shelters. I remembered that yesterday one of the people I met at the Bears den hostile, that is ""the seeker"", had said that I should not stop at the first shelter but keep going 100 yards or so further and there would be a brand new one there. So I did that and didn't fact find a much nicer shelter. The first one head not had a log book and it but the second one did call the wine noticed that the log book was labeled whiskey Hollow shelter. I stopped drink the rest of the water I was carrying and filled to fresh one later bottles with treated water. I also made it peanut butter and jelly tortilla for lunch and ate it while I signed the log book.  
I had already hiked over 18 miles today but I felt good and was only 2 o'clock. I knew I could get at least as far as the Manassas kept shelter 5 miles further but hope time might make it as far as the Jim and Molly Denton shelter 10 miles further.  I also noticed that the the front tip of my left hiking shoe was beginning to peel away from the upper. I know this was probably from tripping on rocks or roots but I made a mental note to try to glue it back down when I got the chance. Efficient up my insect repellent and then got back on the trail. With the .3 side trail included I was back on the 80 itself buy 2:30.
Just past 3 p.m. coming other way I saw ""earth man"" - one of the guys that had spent the night at the Bears den hostile last night. We chatted for awhile and he told me that he had taken a shuttle to front Royal and from there he had hicked North. He said he had recently passed his 10 mile mark for the day. I guess that would have been just before he got to the Manassas gap shelter. He said he had not liked the up and down between the Jim and Molly Denton and the Manassas gap shelters, which are about 5 miles apart, and he said that he had arranged to get picked up at the Ashby Gap Road crossing. That is route 50 and 17. After chatting a little more, talking about the trail conditions, we said farewell. good luck and nice meeting you and we both continued hiking.
Around 4 o'clock I stopped at the Manassas gap shelter. I filled and treated a liter of water and I signed the log book. While I waited I talked to a day hiker who was there. I did not get his name, but he he evidently had originally been from Montpelier Vermont, and we talked about the long trail. He said he had just hiked up from route 66 about an hour and after we talked for a while he left to head back. I got back on the trail and headed south hoping to reach the Jim and Molly Denton shelter sometime between 6 and 7 p.m.
I reached Manassas gap and walked under interstate 66 around 5 p.m. picture. I got to the Jim and Molly Denton shelter about 615pm.  I had a quick dinner of cliff bar, drank some water, refilled all my bottles, and I decided to hike to the Mosby Camp site, a little less than 2 miles further.  I got there some time after 715. 
There, I met another sobo flip flop hiker.  Her trail name was Intrepid. We introduced each other briefly, and then I started setting up my tarp.  She already had her LL Bean ultralight tent set up.  I also helped het hang her bear bag, and then I hung mine.  Just as I was finishing setting my tarp, we started hearing the sound of thunder coming from the southwest.   We weren't sure that's what it was at first, but soon enough, it was pretty clear.  Intrepid climbed into her tent and zipped it up.  As soon as I could,  I got under my tarp and finished setting up. 
As the sound of thunder kept getting closer, it began to rain -- slowly at first. But like the thunder,  it soon intensified, and within 10 minutes of starting, it was raining torrentially.  Simultaneously, it also got dark, and we could see the flashes of lightning lighting up The sky.   The worst of it lasted about a half hour,  and then, around 8:30 p.m. it started to taper off.   The thunder continued, but now it was to our south east.  
I had been glad for the fortunate timing, for the shelter, and for the company of a fellow hiker.  I was also glad I could recline on my air mattress and stay dry - both things reducing the likelihood of electrocution.  I had also surveyed the campsite quickly and was glad there did nor appear to be any trees in danger of falling or blowing over. 
By about 9 p.m. the scary storm had quieted down, though we could still hear it I  the distance.   I hoped there would only be this one wave.  The whole thing was a surprise -- the forecast had been for north rain until Monday or Tuesday (and this was Saturday).
As the rain stopped, the sounds of bugs started.   Loud. Lots of them. Crickets, cicadas,  frogs, And so on.   A cacophony!  I managed to get to sleep anyway.","Bears den hostel

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575740,"I got up around 6 after 8 night of tossing and turning in part due to paying from yesterday's long hike. After breakfast I finished packing up. I took a picture with like her intrepid. And then I hit the trail southbound. 3 miles later roughly I reached the trail intersection with route 522 and I went to the nearby Mountain Home hospital. There the proprietors, Scott and Lisa, give me a cup of coffee and then Lisa help me put some excess items about 2 pounds worth into a flat rate mailbox that she said she would put in the mail the following day because the post office was not open today Sunday. Lisa then took me to a grocery store where I did resupply at her recommendation for 4 days. It may take more than that to cross the Shenandoah National Park which I will enter today. However she said there are frequent enough wayside stuck with food items that I should be able to get additional resupply easily during the crossing. After we returned to the hostel, i repacked my stuff including two freshly folled water bottles and I continued my hike south. I was headed up the trail on the other side of Route 522 at just about noon. I had about 13 miles to go to the shelter I had picked as my likely destination.
When I had just about completed my hike down to route 522, I had noticed that the land on the right hand side of the trail was fenced in, and at the intersection with route 522, was a sign that said Gate 7. Well we were returning from the grocery store I noticed a lot of land similarly fenced. I asked about it and Lisa explained that it is land belonging to the Smithsonian conservation biology institute.  Apparently this is connected also in some way with the National Zoo in Washington DC. The Institute mission is to protect endangered species. Some of those species have Habitat inside restricted only buy the external fence. Apparently it has been challenging protecting those species from wild coyote. Inside the fence there are also additional enclosed spaces for predators. According to Lisa this includes some leopards and some maned wolves.
The initial climb was not too steep but it was sunny and hot. Around 1:30 p.m. I reached the Tom Floyd wayside shelter. I stopped in for a few minutes just to have a drink of water and sign the log book.
Shortly before 2 o'clock I reach the self service kiosk at which hikers sign in at the north end of the Shenandoah National Park. I already had my permit filled out in trouble ticket because Scott head given me a blank one at the mountain home hostel, and he had helps me feel it out. So I just had to drop the two carbon copies into the registration box and affix your top copy to my backpack with the wire provided.
Across the road at Compton gap sometime between 2 and 2:30 and I reached Compton peak about 245 or a little later. As I continue down the trail I could here and see that Skyline Drive was down the Ridgeline downhill to my left and that I was traveling roughly parallel to it. The road went in and out of you several times as I began the climb of North Mount Marshall. The trail was very wide and relatively easy. How about 3:30 I noticed that the section I was going through about halfway up the northern slope of North Mount Marshall was weed whacked. 
Just before 3:45 as I was trying to walk and journal if the same time I walked right past a snake and didn't notice it until I was directly adjacent to it 6 inches away. I took a picture. The snake made no aggressive move. In fact it made hardly any movement at all it simply wiggled its tongue in there probably trying to smell me. None the less I did not like the look of it. If looked to me like it might have a rattle on its tail although the snake did not use it as such.  
In any case I decided to modify my behavior and not try to walk and look at my phone at the same time.
Add about 415 p.m. I'm at to northbound hikers with trail hands ""walk in tree"" and ""rain"".  We talked for about 15 or 20 minutes. Walk said his Trail name was because he is deaf and blind and walks into trees. Rain dipd not explain how she got her name. I asked them about the snake and they identified it has a rattler.  Rain said it look like a timber Rattler
I told them approximately where they would see the snake if it was still there. They gave me a lot of information about the trail south of where I was.
At about 4:45 I came to the summit of North Mount Marshall and shortly after that I came to a viewpoint called the cliffs. From the cliffs I took a picture of the view to the west. According to my map the little pound that was visible in that direction was sundown Virginia.
Shortly after that, I saw Intrepid, who was coming from a view point. She complained about shin muscle pain.  We walked slowly and talked during the remaining mile to the Gravel Springs Hut.   The trail crossed skyline drive, and I noticed that this was the 4th time since the Compton trailhead. There were a bunch of people there already, and more came after we arrived (I would guess a couple dozen all together).  There were already three people in the shelter designed for a max of six. So we decided to tent again. We got good tent spots near a chatty guy trail named ""chipmonk"".  He told us that the first time he had hiked here, in 2005, a SWAT guy had come up behind him, looking for a suspect in a murder that had occurred just north of here.  
I cooked and ate dinner at the picnic table near the shelter, and we carefully put all our food and ""smellable"" items (like toothpaste...) into the bear  box near the shelter.  There were about a dozen bags also hung from a nearby bear pole.  People said there had been a bear sighted here yesterday, casually walking by a out 10 feet from the tent area.  
As part of my pre-bedtime routine, I also applied some Neosporin ointment to the top of my head and my left calf. I apparently abraded the former when I walked into a low-hanging branch over the trail (that I could not see because of the brim of my hat).  I scraped the latter stepping over a tree that had fallen across the trail.  I also bathed feet and washed my muddy legs, and then put on insect repellent  before bed.  By this time it was starting to get dark.  I had no cell data signal so i could not text family or post my journal.  So i shut my phone off for the night.
As I tried to get to sleep, I could hear faint voices coming from the east.  Rowdy campers near skyline drive perhaps?  I'm not sure.  I tried to ignore it, and the  voices were Soon drowned out by the noise of the forest bugs and frogs.  Eventually, I fell asleep anyway.","Mosby camp site

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575778,"Up sometime between 5:30 and 6 a.m. normal routine with a tarp. On the trail after feeling all bottles with treated water at about 7:45. Nice view to the west from little hogs back Mountain at about 8:30 again at 8:45 and other places South of that. Sometime around 10 a.m. is stopped at the Elkwallow wayside. I had a Coca Cola and a cinnamon bun and I talked to to section hikers that I had seen at the gravel Springs Hut yesterday evening. I Also met to retirees and we chatted for awhile while I charge my phone. I also filled to bottles of water from a spigot. Just after 11 with a little over 80% charge on my phone I got back on the trail headed south.
Sometime just before noon about to and a half miles south of the elk wallow wayside I saw two members of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club traveling North checking out the trail. I paused to talk to them briefly and and after a few minutes of conversation one of the gentleman asked is your trail name GI Joe? I replied, ""it is.""  And he introduced himself. He was the father in law of my cousin James Martin. His name is John Hedrick, and he is a retired  Brigadier General in the US Army signal core. We talked for a close to half an hour and as intrepid caught up to us she was kind enough to take care a picture together. After while we're said farewell and safe hiking. And continued on our way, he to the north and I to the south.
At about 1:20 p.m. I stopped at the Beahm's gap overlook just off the trail as it crossed Skyline Drive north of pass Mountain. Other than the spelling I thought this would be a particularly cool place to check on the status of the total eclipse of the Sun which was supposedly about to begin. I sat on the guardrail at the overlook parking area and checked the internet for the status of the Eclipse and found the website I had used a couple days ago to use my GPS location to track the Eclipse progress. Apparently the Eclipse had officially begun at my location 5 minutes earlier and was to reach its maximum at 2:40 p.m. Out of my backpack, I retrieved the Eclipse glasses that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters had given me. I used them to look up briefly and determined that if the Eclipse had begun it wasn't yet visible at my location actually.  Because the maximum would not yet occur for another hour or more, I decided to keep hiking and potentially try to observe the Eclipse from pass Mountain or the past Mountain Hut which was 1.9 miles south of my current location.
As I started to climb pass Mountain, I noticed it began to get darker. However this was because the sky had become mostly cloudy. Just before two o'clock, as I started to get near the summit of pass Mountain I came to a break in the trees and simultaneously a break in the clouds and I took a couple pictures. However, the Eclipse was still not visible to my camera. On the other hand, when I used the Eclipse glasses, I could see that the Sun was about 1/3 blocked on the right hand side as I was looking South Southwest toward it. I tried taking a picture through the Eclipse glasses quit that did not work that camera wouldn't focus.
I got to the pass mountain hut around 2:30.  It had a nice clearing from which I was able to view the eclipse as it peaked about 2:40.  I also ate lunch while there. Then, I hiked back out to the trail.  As I reached the trail, intrepid arrived.  She said she couldn't tell if the eclipse was happening.  So i lent her my glasses.  She also pointed out the pattern of light and shadow on the forest floor that had made her think she might be missing it. Curiously, all the little light patches in the shadow of the trees were crescent shaped!  Maybe caused by diffraction of the light from the eclipse, but at low enough intensity that the pattern actually showed? Picture.
We kept hiking and passed an entrance point for the park. Picture.  We got water at a rest area, and hiked over Mary's Rock (pictures) and further, to the Bird's Nest #3 hut shelter. Pictures.  
There were a couple other hikers there, camping. There was also a group of about 10 students from William and Mary, on an orientation outing.
I had gumbo from packit gourmet for dinner -- excellent.  After hanging bear bags on a bear pole, it was almost bed time.  I tried to work out my strategy for meeting and hiking with Joey next week, south of Waynesboro, VA,  which was now about 75 miles away.","Gravel Springs Hut campsite

When I had arrived earlier I had gotten a Pepsi and a ham sandwich wish I had mostly eating at the time intrepid arrived. Then when she found out about the breakfast buffet I joined her for that. I had french toast, pancakes, bacon, creamed beef on biscuits, an omelette with everything, and a bowl of fresh fruit with Greek yogurt, as well as a glass of orange juice and two cups of coffee. She then hiked on while I filed my jury duty questionnaire.
I got back on the trail about noon.
 I hiked south past timber Hollow overlook and Crescent Rock overlook. I took some pictures of views to the west.  I also passed a Screen fields with views to the west. Picture.
 After all I had eaten hi could see Hill and see that my abdomen was distended. I knew how the snake that I had seen a couple of the days ago had felt, similarly out fitted with lumps in it as if it had just fisted on a mouse or two. I am precise with its lethargy. I maintained a decent pace none the less. There were some really nice views a long the way. Pictures.
Intrepid and I both ended up passing each other during breaks, and we arrived at the big meadows campground (the largest such in the SNP) at about 3pm.  Pictures. We had to hunt a bit to find the office so we could check in.  We sent up tents near the park entrance in a place not too close to the road. Picture. Then she went to find the Byrd park visitors center. Meanwhile, I refilled water, washed and dried my laundry, and took a shower.  I charged my phone while my clothes were drying. I wore my rain pants and a windbreaker well doing laundry because all my hiking clothes were nasty dirty and needed washing. Pictures. 
The attendant at the laundry and shower area was also kind enough to show me where the lodge building was. She also gave me tips on where in the park I might be able to get phone service.After laundry and shower re finished setting up my camp area and clip my clean clothes away and then I walked up to the lodge. There I had a small salad and so I thought wings. While I was enjoying that food a bluegrass music and begin to set up. So I stayed until they started at 8:30 p.m. and had played a couple songs. Then I walked back to my campsite in the dark. There were plenty of lights in the campground so it was not a problem finding my way.","Byrd's Nest #3 hut shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575971,"Had some difficulty sleeping last night and the campground do to nice made by campers next door and other campers a little farther rough will light shining brightly into the open and of my tarp.  It also rains lightly on and off during the night but this was not really a bother. By morning my tarp and most of my surroundings dry.
I got up at 6 and got ready for the day. instead of cooking, I ate my oatmeal dry. As I was packing up it began raining lightly again. Are you just cussed with intrepid my plans for arriving in Waynesboro on the 26th to link up with Joey. She said that aligned with her plans because she needed to get off the trail in order to get food there. So at about 7:30 we headed up past the big Meadows lodge and took the Black Rock Trail back to the Appalachian Trail. We stopped at a viewpoint on the way. This guy was dark with great clouds but we had a good 180 degree panorama of the valley to the west including the site of rain falling on the hills to the south west of us where we would probably have to walk today.
As I was walking up the trail around 8 a.m. I happen to see a large turkey and a deer on the trail in front of me at the same time. In general the morning hike was relatively easy. The trail was wide and relatively flat even the climbed up to hazel top which looked into dating on my elevation profile was only 600 feet up over 3 miles. At the top of Mount Hazeltop, I took a couple pictures of nice westward views.
The climb over bear fence Rock was stepper and slower going. I arrived at the turnoff for the blue trail to the bear fence shelter at about 10:15 a.m. I decided to hike the .1 mile distance to the shelter and take a break. The blue trail to the shelter was made of a grey gravel road bed so I scratched and arrow into the ground is an attempt should let intrepid know which way I had gone.
At the bear fence shelter, I had snack and some water and I met 3 other southbound hikers. These were ""Backwoods Ken""  ""Backwoods Barbie"", and ""Cattywhompus.""
The latter got his name from the way his backpack always seems lopsided. I chatted with them for a while and took a picture. In the photo, Cattywhompus is in a lower right for ground and his pack is in the upper left with huge circular to person tent strapped to it. I left the shelter after signing a log book and headed back up towards the trail at about 10:45. Intrepid had not shown up yet and must have either been further back on the trail or chosen not to hike the extra distance to this intermediate shelter. In any case my arrow on the ground was on disturbed so I erased it And drew another pointing straight ahead on the Appalachian Trail. I figured she'd probably passed by and that I would catch up with her.
I didn't fact catch up with her at the Lewis campsite 2 miles later. She was having a snack and talking to two northbound takers. So I stopped when she offered to share peanut butter crackers that she gotten as trail magic but wouldn't eat.  
After Lewis Mountain we went over Saddleback Mountain or at least parts of it. And from there down to a park entrance station where we took a break at about 3:30 p.m. interrupted was getting some blister sister watched your feet and put on some band aids. We both also had lunch. For me that was a tuna salad tortilla and I ate the remnants of my jar of peanut butter and jelly with a spoon.
Afterward we headed back to the trail. That is we were crossing the bridge over a4 lane road coming in and out of the park I saw a large animal near a road sign about 200 yards ahead. Its was a black bear. That is number 6 that I have seen since beginning my Appalachian Trail hike in April. Shortly after we saw the bear we had to turn right and go up the trail into the woods about 100 meters from where the bear head run up into the woods as a pickup truck had just come by. And it was a long 2 mile climb to the top of high top Mountain. But the slope was gentle at least.
I stopped for a while at an overlook near the peak. I took some pictures of the view to the Westover the Shenandoah Valley and what intrepid said she believed was the Massanutten mountain range. Intrepid caught up shortly thereafter and she took off her shoes and sat on the rocks at the peak and had a snack. She said she was going to stay there for about a half an hour. Meanwhile I put my backpack back on and height down the south side of high top the short half mile to the high top Mountain shelter.  At the shelter, I set up, got water, made dinner, discussed hike plans for the following days.  I also used my new ""bear-proof"" Ursack as my container for hanging food.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576090,"I slept well last night and got up when it was light enough to see without a headlamp at 6 a.m. I get organized and had hot oatmeal and hot coffee for breakfast. Intrepid got up around 6:30 and I chatted with her as she was getting ready and having breakfast. I had it out on the trail South around 8 a.m. It was overcast and cool maybe in the upper 60's. Perfect hiking weather.
Sometime after 9:15 I stopped to take a break at a rare Eastward facing viewpoint just south of Powell gap. About 10a.m., I met day hiker ""Hog On Ice"" with an interesting home made hammock. (Name from slipping on ice and making a noise that sounded like a hog call.)  Hammock design on hikinghq.net
(hog_on_ice@hotmail.com). Intrepid was already there talking to him.
We left HOI sometime after 10:15 I imagine and continued South for a while the troubles flat and then it went up. While on the way up I met a trail maintain ER and stopped to talk to him for a few minutes. His wife was from Maine and he had numberbeen fishing in Northern New York at cranberry Lake and  of times. Intrepid past me while I was getting with him. Afterward I think him for taking care of the trail and I continued south. Add probably about 1145 I came to the turnoff for the Plainfield Hut. Intrepid was already there and just because we didn't feel like walking down the 2/10 of a mile to the Hut we just parked on the side of the trail and ate lunch. While we were eating a northbound hiker joined us after stopping to talk with us for a little while. He had just recently started his northbound hike but intended to go as long as he could. While we were talking he named himself Rambo. After lunch I continued south. Sometime before 1 p.m. buy hey arrived at I'm here Rock Creek overlook which and a very nice view to the east. Pictures.
I continued south up a steep climb over some high ground that clearly had been stripped of all vegetation buy a fire some years ago. New growth was coming along fairly well, but it was much easier to see through the trees to the longer distance here. Then according to my map I entered Albemarle County and began to climb down. Shortly thereafter I came to viewpoint overlooking to the west and I took a picture and then continued South.
Shortly before 2 o'clock I arrived at the loft Mountain wayside.  I stopped and had a burger and fries and charges my phone.  Intrepid arrived about 30 min later.  We saw a big rat eating  crumbs on the porch where we were eating.  Picture.
We then hiked to the loft Mountain campground. We checked in and then occupied a campsite and set up.  Then went back to the camp store and got a few items while Intrepid did some laundry.  When I got back it was dinner time. I had a turkey and cheese sub that I had gotten at the camp store. Then a lady in a campsite nearby invited us and a couple of other hikers to help her and her husband finish the food that they did not want to take home. So I had another cheeseburger and a hot dog and a cookie...
It rained lightly on and off as we were eating, and the sun set. So soon it was bed time.","High-top Hut shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576128,"Up at 6 a.m. this morning feeling a little puffy from all the food I ate yesterday also did not sleep all that will last night. Didn't take any motrin before going to bed and I was a key and restless until about 3 a.m. when I finally started getting some real sleep. Packed up and head some breakfast, refilled water, and was on the trail sometime between 7:30 and 8 a.m. continued southbound. About 8:20 I came up on a bright yellow sign and date taped off area along the trail. The sign read "" danger active Hornets nest. Avoid taped off area.""  I saw a the big paper wasp nest about 30 feet head so I backed up there Trail and found a way around it in the woods.
Shortly after that I came to the Big Run overlook and I considered taking hey quick break but the valley was so cloudy either was no view. There was also very little phone service. I received a few messages but I couldn't send or post anything. Anyway I like kept hiking south. Has I was walking down the trail I felt a light sensation on my neck. This often has happened particularly in the morning as the first hiker up the trail is always clearing cobwebs, and the cobwebs cling to you for awhile after you break through them, and you can't always see them so as to take them down with trekking poles or avoid them. I tried to clear away the cobwebs but they were persistent. I then thought maybe it's the strap I I have connected to my glasses, so I tried to push that out of the way. Instead I found a stick bug clinging to my finger.  I probably could have taken a picture of it but I was kind of creeped out so I just flipped it off into the woods.
About 845 I arrived at the Doyles River overlook off Skyline Drive. There was still a lot of Cloud cover but it appeared to be lifting someone and in the distance I could see be nice the clouds it small number of buildings in the valley below to the east. Picture.
As I continued South the hike was relatively smooth. Around 11 a.m. I came to a large Talus field or rock slide across which the trail traversed. In the distance to the right or west I could see surrounding villages quite a way off. Picture.   Consulting my map I learned that this was the peak of what is called Black Rock.  The trail wound around to the left and offered a view to the southeast. Picture. I posed to scramble further up rock pile so that I can take pictures and a panorama from the top.
Sometime before 1130 I came to the turnoff for the side trail to the black Rock Hut. I left a narrow of small rocks on the side of the trail so that intrepid would know which way I had gone. The trail down to the hutch was narrow and steep but at almost exactly 11:30 I arrived at the Hut itself. One of the reasons we had discussed coming here was that there were no documented water sources for the next 12 miles. However when I checked the small stream below the Hut March with a sign the said unprotected water source boil for one full minute, there was actually no water at all. Was good thing that I still had 2 full leaders from this morning as it has been relatively cool and I had. Been that thirsty. I paused to open a snack bar for lunch and then I started back up to the trail. On the way I met intrepid who was coming down. I informed her there was no water, and we continued up to the trailer section or she stopped. She said she would have lunch there before continuing but intended to hike and all the way to the calf Mtn shelter. I continued downhill to the South. About noon I crossed the rock gap and Skyline Drive. Then I continued up hill on the other side of the gap.
About 5pm or a little earlier, arrived at the Calf mountain shelter.  Glad to find a spring with water. No other source since this morning.  Met s bunch of other hikers:

There we met Ben and later Katie and her friend Brandon. Ben also brought is dog Olive. We headed south on the trail just before 1:30 p.m. Ben took Olive off the leash and Olive seems to really enjoy the freedom of running back and forth up the trail to the lead hiker and back to the trail hiker and so forth.
Ben, Katie, Brandon, and Olive had to turn around at about 2 p.m. Joey and I continued. We passed Denim about 3 p.m., and we arrived at the Paul Wolfe shelter about 3:30 p.m. We set up camp -- Joey his tent and me my tarp.

Joey and I got up around 6:30 this morning, made breakfast: oatmeal and coffee and bacon that Joey brought. Then we broke down our camp, got packed up, got some more water, and headed south on the trail. We talked to Denim about his tent for a few moments before getting started. So we were actually on the trail about 8:40.
Shortly after we left the shelter we met 3 elderly gentleman hiking North. Joey and I stopped to talk to them for about 15 minutes. They were interested in our hike and had done large sections of the Appalachian Trail themselves. After saying farewell and safe hiking we continued South.
The morning hike up Humpback Mountain was basically an uphill 2000 foot climb. Part way up about 11 o'clock we reached a side trail, and at the recommendation of the guys we had seen earlier, we decided to hike the one quarter mile trail down to what is called Humpback Rock. At this point a large formation of slanted rock juts sharply out of the hillside, providing a cliff top to which we could climb and from which we could see pretty much the entire Shenandoah Valley to the west and the little bit of the valley on the eastern side of the mountain range on which we were hiking. We both took some pictures from this location and then we paused for a snack break.
Shortly after that we reached the actual summit of Humpback Mountain. A mile later we came to a viewpoint from which we could see the Wintergreen ski area and we took some more pictures from this cliff top.  Later we passed the Dripping Rock parking area on the Blue Ridge Parkway, another viewpoint called rock paint, and yet another from which we could see the Three Ridges. From there it was a short hike to the Reeds Gap Road crossing and parking lot. And from there only 2 miles to the Maupin Field Shelter.  On the way a couple of day hikers had told us there was no water at the shelter, so when we arrived and found a shallow and running spring behind the shelter we were very happy. We filtered four liters of water and then started preparing dinner. Intrepid arrived shortly after that.  And just as we were collectively about halfway through with dinner the two of the elderly gentleman we had seen in the morning showed up with two pizzas and a half dozen bottles of water. So we had a sort of Pizza party with them for a little while. Their names were Junkyard Jim, who was 72, and Russell, who was 78. Jim claimed that Russell was the fastest bow-legged man in Virginia.  We thanked them profusely and they departed to return home about a half an hour later. We finished dinner and as we were doing so three other through hikers arrived at different times. One party was a couple of two northbound. And the other was a single hiker who arrived relatively late, and I did not get much information from him yet. And before we knew it it began to get dark. We finished preparing our bear hang for the bear pole and getting ready for bed."," Paul Wolfe shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576449,"Edit yesterday: the last guy to arrive was ""Beaker"" who was wearing a kilt and beret and a shirt from the Irish pub at the Inn at Long Trail.  
We got up at 8am, after it had rained hard from about three a.m.  The couple who tented were up first, and it seemed none of the rest of us were anxious to go out (from warm sleeping bags) into the cold rain.  Slowly we ""warmed"" to the idea though, and Joey and I and Intrepid finished breakfast and filtering some more water, and we were hiking south on the trail around 10:15 a.m.  The morning hike up Three Ridges was relatively easy, but we had only partial views. We reached the summit and then hiked more carefully down the slippery rocks on the south side. We arrived at the Harper's Creek shelter about 1p.m.  We all had lunch there, and Joey and I decided to hike on and climb the priest.  Intrepid chose to remain there, however. So we said goodbyes, and ""see you up the trail"".  
Joey and I left the Harper's Creek shelter about 2:15p.m., and we reached the Tye River and crossed a suspension bridge (pictures) about 3:00.  We then began the 3000 foot climb up The Priest. We chatted along the way about a whole bunch of subjects, and this made the climb easier for me. We reached a very nice easterly view part way up and took pictures. All of the remaining viewpoints were above the cloud line, however. We reached the summit and then The Priest Shelter a bit before 6 p.m.  
There was already one hiker (""Morocco Mole, with his dog ""lil woof"") and a large college orientation group from nearby W&L College (pictures). The students had stayed in the shelter all day after getting caught in the rain the night before (some had left clothing and boots out, and these things had been soaked). They were in the process of cooking dinner when we arrived, but they moved their stuff out of the shelter and into tents. Joey and I moved into the shelter with Morocco Mole. We made dinner for ourselves and chatted with the whole group for about an hour and a half. Then we hung our bear bags and got ready for bed.","Maupin Field shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576547,"I got up with the lights sometime between 6 and 6:30. Joey got a good night's sleep I think and woke up around 7 a.m. thinking it was 1:45. We filtered some more water and made breakfast and completed a normal morning routine and were on the trail sometime around 8:30 a.m. The sky was just barely starting to become a little bit blue when we left the shelter. By the time we reached the first viewpoint we could see fairly clearly across the valley to the south although the top of the mountain in the distance was still shrouded in clouds. Pictures.
Sometime around 10 a.m. we passed the group of hikers from W&L College who had stopped along the trail to make breakfast. And shortly after that we met four northbound hikers. First were two elderly gentleman, one who I noticed was wearing a shirt with three 2000 miler rockers on it under and Appalachian Trail patch. He said his real name was Lee Boner and his trail name was Loner Boner. We chatted with them for just a few minutes and then continued hiking South. We came to the actual Spy Rock area right about 10:15.
We dropped our packs at the base of the big rock and followed the instructions we had received from Junkyard Jim and Russell a couple of days ago. They had said it was easier to climb to the top of the rock by going around to the left of it, so that's what we did. After about 10 minutes of scrambling we were on top and had a 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. Some of these were still shrouded in mist. But we could see quite a distance and took several pictures. I then contacted Stanimal, our shuttle driver who would pick Joey up and deliver my supply box near the fish hatchery north of the trails on Spy Rock Road in the town of Montebello. We confirmed a 12 noon link up planned. Joey and I then climbed back down the rock, put our packs back on, and continued hiking south on the Appalachian Trail.
At about 10:50 we reached Spy Rock Road and turned right in order to go downhill to the north. We followed the nicely labeled blue blaze path along a gravel road all the way to and beyond a gate across the road, which was labeled foot traffic only no public vehicle access. About 20 minutes later we came to the intersection of Spy Rock Road and Fish Hatchery Road. Here there was another gate from our side, which basically said no trespassing but was traversing a public road. On the other side of the gate was a National Forest hiker parking area specifically provided so that hikers could use the path we had just come down in order to access the National Forest. However on the downhill side of the gate were several warning and no trespassing signs, including one that was a picture of a hiker with a circle slash, and another that read ""no public access to the National Forest"". Anyway, Joey and I went into the hiker parking area and waited for Stanimal, the owner of the hiker hostel in which I had stayed in Waynesboro and the operator of the shuttle service that would bring Joey back to his car. While we were waiting we finished cross-leveling food and trash. Joey was kind enough to take my three days of food trash from me so I wouldn't have to carry it anymore. And he gave me the remainder of his food supply, which he didn't need anymore. That included several packets of instant oatmeal, a tortilla wrap, and one packet of pre-cooked bacon. The shuttle arrived about 1145 and Adam gave me the box of supplies I had left with him in Waynesboro. Joey loaded his things into the truck. We said goodbye. I put on my backpack. They waved as they drove away. I was sad and a little tearful, and the back of my throat hurt. I waved back and when they were around the corner, I started my hike back up past the no trespassing signs up the long hill and back to the Appalachian Trail.
I was back at the intersection with the Appalachian Trail at about 10 after 12. I was pretty sweaty at that point and I was glad I had changed from the long sleeve shirt I started out into my short sleeve shirt while we were at the parking lot below.
I stopped at the trail intersection to drink some water and enjoy the cool breeze. Then I continued hiking South.

About 1245 I passed several apple trees and noticed that ripe fruit from them had fallen onto the ground. Pictures. I stopped and picked an apple and ate it.
I arrived at the Sealy Woodworth shelter at about 1:15 p.m. Morocco Mole and Lil Woof were already there. The dog barked at me initially but warmed up quickly. I sat and talked with Morocco for a few minutes before he headed down the trail.  He told me that he knew John Hedrick and that he had been John's vice president of the Potomac Appalachian Trail club when John had been president. John had also been vice president when Morocco had been president of the Potomac Appalachian Trail club.  I also reviewed my plan for the day. I had intended to stop at this shelter but it was very early in the day, and having dropped Joey off with his shuttle, I was feeling a little melancholy. So I decided I should just keep walking a little longer today. I also decided that I should fill up on water before leaving here. So I hiked the additional .1 mile down a side trail to find a pipe spring that was gushing. This was the nicest water source I had seen in over a week, and I was happy with my choice. Picture. After filling water I hiked back up past the shelter to the trail and continued south.
About 2:30 I passed the W&L group of students for a third time as they were stopping to take a bio break. Earlier they had told me they intended to stop at the Sealy Woodworth shelter, but evidently they too had decided to take advantage of the nice weather and hike further today. No more than 10 minutes after I had passed them I ran into a different group of W&L students who were northbound. I stopped and talked to them for a few minutes. Then I continued South. Around 3 p.m. I caught up to Morocco and Woof.  
At about 4:30 p.m. I reached Tar Jacket Ridge Peak and a viewpoint. I took a picture of the nice vista to the east.
I got to the hog camp at about 5 p.m. Rachel was already there. I helped her hang a bear bag. I then set up my tarp and made dinner.
Morocco and Woof arrived around 5:30 p.m. as it was starting to rain. I finished my dinner and got under my tarp. The W&L group arrived sometime between 6 and 6:30 p.m. after the rain had stopped. Everybody chatted and compared notes on the day, and then the W&L group moved off to set up camp. Soon enough, bed time.","The Priest shelter

I got up about 4:30 a.m. because I had already had lots of sleep and couldn't sleep anymore. It was dark so I got dressed and began packing up by red light headlamp. I was is quiet as possible so is to try not to disturb the other campers.  I thought it would take longer, but I was completely packed by 5:30 a.m. so I put on my pack and I did something I have not done before. I hiked by headlamp in the morning. The foliage on and around the trail was damp with rain and dew.  Voodoo sparkle almost white like frost in the light of my headlamp. I took a picture.
I headed south and buy a fence near a gravel road I found that a trail angel had left to to gallon containers of water. I was carrying one and a half leaders and an empty bottle so I filled my empty bottle from the trail angels supply. I then headed south and the trail begin to climb Mount Cole.  About 545 I reached a clearing and noticed that the light from the Sun was beginning to be a parent in that eastern sky. Picture. I kept hiking and came to another clearing and the red highlights from the sunrise were quite clear now although the sky remained dark and I could see several stores and a very bright planet directly above the eastern horizon. Picture. Hi kept taking and I came to yet another clearing that passed over a shoulder of Mount Cole and up its Eastern side. I took several more pictures from various places along the path during this climb. As I continue to hike the day became brighter and I put my headlamp away. As I began to descend the Western side of the mountain I took a few more pictures from you point so long the way.
Shortly after 7 I passed the cow camp gap and 8.5 mile side trail to the cow camp shelter. I decided not to go there and continued hiking. Around 730 I came to the top of bald Knob. As I Verizon my guide book this peak was not in fact bald. However I did have a nice view to the north north east and I took a picture. I also took a break here to eat breakfast. I had instant oatmeal, to of the packets the Joey had left me, and instant coffee, both prepared with a jet boil stove that Joey had brought me. Between the rest from hiking and the nourishment of the breakfast I felt ready to start my day. & I was already about 4 miles into it.
I don't remember what time it was that I started hiking after breakfast, but I arrived at route 60 and the long Mountain wayside at right about 9 a.m. According to a sign posted near the trailhead the priest shelter was 20 miles north of here.  This is where Joey and I would have hiked if we had started together at the reeds gap trailhead. I took a picture and then I continued hiking south.
At 9:30 I pass the small sign that provided information about a community of freed slaves who had in Habitat the land just south of where I was as share croppers.  The landlord was a Mr Taft Hughes and the sign explains that the tenants paid 1/4 of their crop in rent unless they did not own there own team, of plowing animals such as horses or oxen suppose, in which case you paid half of your crop in rent. Apparently many of them group corn and paid 1/8 of their corn in payment for getting it ground at the grist mill in the community owned by a Mr Joe Davis. Apparently the community this banded in the early 1920 is when they sold their land to the US Forest Service.
I reached the brown Mountain shelter just before ten a.m. and stop for a break and a snack. I spent quite a while reading through the log book after I signed it myself. I found entries from Kansas, stamps, and silver girl, each of whom had passed me during their northbound hike going 25 to 30 miles a day. In fact the entry from silver girl is the one in which she documents her conversion from her previous trail name of little Zoe. Evidently the past couple of days had been hard for her and as a positivity boost she looked to Paul Simon and was inspired by the song bridge over troubled water and decided to be his silver girl.
Her entry was dated the 27th of March, and it was basically the same story she told me when I met her in Southern New York State in late April. I also found an entry from Flickr dated the 29th of March, but this was not the same Flickr I had known. This one was a KA echo and appeared to be southbound. Then I noticed and entry from December 10th 2016 signed by Gandalf and Flickr. This one said cold start to the morning hike! 16 degrees at 10:30 a.m.! Reached 800 miles today! This very likely was the same hikers I had met in April in Southern Pennsylvania and hike with for over three weeks. Pictures.
I stopped to get water at the nearby brown Mountain Creek. Rachel passed me while I was treating my water.  We said hello and talked about the sunrise, then she hiked on. After finishing with my water, I got back on the trail around 10:25 a.m.
About 11:15 a.m., I caught up with Rachel again as she was taking a break beside the creek. We talked about our contingency plan for the weather. Several people had said and my weather app seemed to confirm that it would be a decent day today but that tomorrow, Friday the 1st , would be very rainy with a possibility of thunderstorms.  Rachel also told me that this summer she had worked for the PATC and that her boss there had warned her that there was a 30 mile section of the Appalachian Trail coming up in which there would be no water. Rachel referred to her notes and guide book and told me that this was from something Meadow, at mile 718.7 until mile 694.5, but there may be a way to hitch at 702.4 (VA 624) where there is a gas station that may have water.
As I continued South, around 1130, the trail went up to the left and began to skirt a large reservoir. In most places although I could see the water through the trees there was no clear view. I did find one vantage point from which I took a picture of the water through the trees and the buildings on the other side. At around noon I heard the sound of a telephone ringing in the middle of the woods. I looked but could not determine where it was coming from, and I continued hiking.
Sometime shortly after noon the trail crossed  a suspension bridge, over the river feeding the reservoir. It then came to the road which I recognized as the marker indicating bed most if not all of the rest of the days hike would be up hill. My current elevation was roughly 1000 feet, and the punch bowl shelter, which was 4.5 miles ahead, was at roughly 2500 feet. If I were to try to go further and reach the Johns hallow shelter, I would have to cross Bluff Mountain at something over 3300 feet. I would also have to hike in additional 9 miles. Please options were on my mind because of the weather situation mentioned above. I hoped to get as close to Glasgow as possible today, so that I could reduce the mileage I would have to walk tomorrow in bad weather to reach the town where I intended to stay at a hostel and shower, and do laundry, and resupply.
Sometime around 1230, I saw blaze, hiker I had not seen since the paul wolfe shelter. Julie and I had seen him there and that was the second meeting for me because I had met him seriously at some point in the Shenandoah. After a brief chat, we both continued up the hill. Blaze had zero'd at the Paul wolfe shelter. So I could not understand how he was now in front of me. Either he had hiked 3 days at more than 20 miles each, or he had gotten off the trail and skipped a section. He now said he was going to the punch bowl shelter, so I made a note to ask him about this when we were both there. Shortly after that I'm at a third group of students from Washington and Lee college on their orientation hike. They were coming down the hill so they made way and allowed me to hike past them, and after some pleasantries a continued up the hill.
Add about 1 p.m. I reached the peak of rice Mountain. And then after a short decent started back uphill again. I then Crossed another Intermediate peak and then went down to a blue Ridge Parkway crossing. Then back up the hill again.
I arrived at the punch bowl shelter at about 10 after 2 p.m. I signed the log book and had lunch. I ate a tortilla with jalapeno flavored tuna, and bacon, and mayonnaise. Picture. Then I ate a peanut butter and jelly tortilla with bacon. Picture. Both were excellent!
After lunch I checked but found that the water sources at the shelter were nasty. So I decided not to get any here.  I've been spent a few minutes coordinating with stanimal, and order to set up a ride from route 501 to Glasgow tomorrow morning. This was necessary because they're would be no phone service in that area or in location i intend to stop tonight. As I was wrapping that up, Rachel arrived. She had told me she was going to get picked up by her parents at the Blue Ridge Parkway crossing that I had already passed. She confirmed us again went you get to the shelter but hit said that there wasn't any where to camp near there and her parents were coming with calling day. Therefore she hit climbed up to the shelter spend the night and we go back down to your car tomorrow. The last time I had seen her she hit also said her phone was dead. I had thought about this while I was hiking, and this time I offered and she accepted a charge from my backup battery. I did not have a lot, but I hoped the some other hiker would be willing to do the same for me, at sometime when I might need to make one phone call for coordination or emergency. So I stayed at the shelter a few minutes longer will she church your phone to 10% and then turned it off. Then I hiked back up to the trail and continued south. I had 9 more miles to go. I knew that I would not have cell coverage at my destination so I decided that I would upload a partial journal when I reached the top of Bluff Mountain. Then I would have to catch up a bit after reaching the hostel tomorrow.
I reached the summit of Bluff Mountain about 3:50 and spend some time uploading my initial journal for the day. I also met there a hike her names Pablo who was doing a 100 mile trek north bound to Waynesboro. We each took turns taking the other's photo and I gave him the contents of my 20 ounce water bottle because he was almost out of water, and I knew that the water source at the shelter he would be staying at was not very good. I left the peak and headed down hill to the south at about 4:15 p.m.
About 5:30 p.m. I got to some cliffs North of the top of little rocky row. There was a viewpoint here overlooking the valley to the east. I took a picture. Then just before the summit there was a view to the west. Picture. The descent of little rocky row was,  well, a little rocky. There was also a narrow Ridgeline with very nice view to the east including and overlook of the James River and a railroad on its East bank.
I got to the John's Hollow shelter about 630 p.m.  There was yet another group of students from Washington and Lee college already there, camping near the shelter and using the picnic table.  They gave me some of the stir-fry left overs from their ""iron camp-chef"" competition.  We traded hiking stories for a while, and then I refilled and treated all my bottles of water.  After that, I made my own dinner of sweet and sour pork (a la mountain house).  After dinner,  the students invited me to sit with them at the picnic table, and we played card tricks, and they also invited me to make s'mores with them.  We hung bear bags after that and then just hung out at the picnic table until it was time to sleep.
Before I went to bed, I signed the log book in the shelter, and I included a comment about how all four of the groups from W & L that I had met were super, courteous, enthusiastic, great attitudes, great ambassadors and representatives of their school and themselves.Surprisingly I had great phone reception here, so I updated my trail journal and captioned the pictures I had uploaded over the last several days. Then I went to sleep.","Hog Camp

Then I finished packing up my stuff, and at about 7:15, I headed back up to the trail, and set out to the south in order to meet my shuttle driver at 9 a.m.
Pickup went as planned.  I checked into the hostel, got a shower, did laundry, and then went to the dollar General and the grocery store to get supplies.  The rest of the day, I relaxed and binge-watched defenders on Netflix. 
Wesley (Mr Lippy) also checked into the hostel.   I had hiked with him and several others on the Long Trail in Vermont, although I called him Adam because that's what his brother called him.  He had wanted to hike some more and asked if he could join me. I said ok.

I checked my pack weight after yesterday's resupply, and it was a little over 40 pounds with all of my food and all of my water bottles full. This was too much, so I went through my food bag and pulled out two packs of beef jerky, one knorr meal, one jar of peanut butter and jelly, and one almost-empty fuel canister.  I gave away the beef jerky to members of the softball team that were also staying at the hostel, I put the fuel canister in the hiker box, & I ate the jar of peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. That was about 2100 calories!
After settling up with the hostel manager, the shuttle driver gave Wesley and me a ride to the trailhead. We got on the trail southbound about 10 a.m. The first part of the walk was across a bridge over the James River and on the other side I saw sign that indicated that this was called the foot bridge not because people walk on it but because it was named after someone who's last name was foot. Apparently Bill Foot and his wife were avid hikers and were the first two people to complete the coast to coast cross country American discovery trail.
We stopped briefly at the Matt's creek shelter, and then moved on. At some point, we met several day hikers.  The last two of these, we talked to for a few minutes.  They were  Josh, who was in the Army for 5 yrs as a 31F (MSE SEN operator, and Brandon who we did not get to know as much about.  Later, near the peak of Apple orchard Mountain, we met hiker Brown Arrow -- a woman in her 70 maybe even 80s, who was hiking northbound to Pennsylvania, trying to reach the official halfway point on the Appalachian Trail. She intended to meet friends there.
We reached the  Thunder Hill shelter around 3:30 p.m. and took a short break.   We decided to continue, and around 5:30 p.m. We came to the Cornelius Creek shelter.  Here we met Henry who was on his 3rd day of a 4 day hike.  He was an IT professional employee of the patent office in Shirlington, VA (near the Pentagon).  We talked about hiking and the trail.  Then we ate dinner and hung a bear bag.  It was cold, and we all added a layer.  Soon it began to get dark.","Glasgow Stanimal 328 Hostel

Took pic of view to the west.  Nice valley; could see quite far. Then arrived at the Cove Mountain shelter about 1 p.m. I ate a bacon chicken and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise on lavash bread. The chicken and lavash bread for given to me by the W & L students before they stopped hiking. The bacon I got in Glasgow after seeing and tasting the bacon Joey had brought when he was hiking with me. We were back on the trail shortly after 1:30 p.m.
The continuing climb up Cove Mountain went along a narrow Ridgeline which offered more of use to the west and to East. Picture.
Later we passed views at the Peaks of otter and bear wallow gap. Pictures. And then Mills gap. Picture. Shortly after that would came to Bobblet's gap.  And at another overlook are saw a sign describing the migration patterns of Hawks. Picture. In the view to the west I could see a hawk circling in order to gain elevation by writing a thermal up draft kama exactly as depicted in the graphic on the sign. On the opposite side of the road there was also a great view to the east at a point where they wouldn't guardrail curved as the road vent to the right and I could see trails on the slopes on the opposite side of the valley in the distance.
At this point we had come 20 miles from our start this morning. Wesley took a5 minute break while I continued walking slowly. I knew he would catch up, being 22 years younger and a bit faster. I was hoping to get to the Wilson Creek shelter tonight so that we would have fewer miles tomorrow remaining between our start and the town of Daleville. I had contacted a friend from college who lives in Roanoke and she had invited me to dinner kama shower, and laundry, not necessarily in that order, at his house. So I was hoping to be able to reach the town of Daleville early enough in the afternoon to make this convenient for him.
Shortly after that I came to another overlook labeled Montvale and took some more pictures. I think there mat have been a couple more overlooks, but eventually, we reached the Wilson creek shelter.  Tupe was there, as well as two other groups of hikers.

Dave had started to prepare breakfast, & I had a cup of coffee and watched the news with him for a while. So he got up shortly after that and we ate breakfast together. I had pancakes with blueberries and maple syrup as well as bacon and eggs over easy. It was excellent! During breakfast we talked a lot about what it was like to be hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Afterward Susie took a picture of Dave and me.
Dave then drove me back to the trailhead and along the way pointed out the train across which I would be hiking today. He dropped me off at the Howard Johnsons where was lying I refilled our water bottles and then started South at about 9:15 a.m.
The morning hike was initially St Paul Hill climb to the top of a Ridgeline a long which we walked 4 miles. There were several spots from which I could see a long way. Pictures. Original answer come navigate today large reservoir and took us to the west and South. Along the way we caught up with and past papa bear and puffy muffin.
Eventually we came to the Lamberts meadow shelter. Their we refilled all our water. This we were told would be the last place we would find reliable water on the trail for the next 30 miles. We also had lunch. We also met southbound through hiker Stewart. He was a veterinarian from Atlanta. He had started the hike last year and gotten all the way from Mount Katahdin and main to Buena Vista Virginia. Very had to get off the trail because of foot injuries. He started again at Boynton Vista this year and was headed south. For lunch, I ate 3 pieces of pizza left over from yesterday's visit to Pizza Hut, which wisely head stored in his hotel room fridgerator for me. I also eight three pieces of bacon which Susie had given me and leftovers from this morning breakfast.
After lunch we started up hill again. There would be too more 1000 foot climbs before we would reach McAfee's knob. We were hoping that he weather would hold out for us. There were predictions of 55% chance of rain and a possibility of sooner store for this afternoon. Wesleyan I had talked about potentially stopping at the Campbell shelter prior to McAfee's knob, in order to let the weather pass. Then we could try to hike through the most photograph part of the trail hopefully in a better day tomorrow. However, our preferred course would be to hike to Maxie's know of and Beyond and stay at the Catawba shelter on the far side. That would be a total of approximately 18 miles for today.
After the first large climb of the afternoon I reached tinker cliffs. From here there were awesome views. Picture. And a distance, to the west, we could see McAfee knob, where we hope to be later today. Stewart pointed it out and said from there you'll be looking back to the east and you should be able to see tinker cliffs where were standing now. I guess that was sometime between 2 and 2:30 p.m. I we continued hiking, and the trail followed a semi circular Ridgeline to the left and back to the right from East to west around the southern end of the valley. Sometime between 2:30 and 3 we started to hear thunder and we could see dark grey clouds forming over to the western sky line. This sounds in the dark ending sky got closer as we continued hiking. Wesleyan hi discussed ever options, and we decided to aim for the Campbell shelter. Then we would reassess the situation there. We quickened our pace and I pressed on through the burning sensation in my legs, figuring that's we were about to get wet but the sooner I  arrived at the shelter that less wet I would be.
We arrived at Campbell shelter sometime around 3:30 p.m. and head only felt a few drops of rain. I consulted the weather and radar apps on my phone. It looked like they're was a massive line precipitation approaching from the west about to hit the West side of the Appalachian Mountain chain all the way from Georgia to Pennsylvania. 

However examining in detail the area around the blue Point indicating our position on the map, I could see their was actually a hole in the weather pattern, perhaps the Lee of some significant terrain feature to the west of us. This appeared to be providing an area of clear skies in the area through which we needed to walk. So we decided to continue.
It was only .7 miles from Campbell shelter to McAfee nope. We reached it around for p.m. and we stayed there for a while, taking pictures. Then we continued on. We decided to pass up the Catawba Mountain shelter, and we continued to the Johns spring shelter, 1 mile further. We arrive there around 5:30 p.m.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577192,"Up
at 6:30 a.m., normal routine, except I was low on water so I ate my oatmeal dry
and I simply put my coffee grounds into my remaining 1/2 liter of water.
Westlake, Stewart, and I all started hiking about 8:00 and we crossed route 311
about 20 minutes later. It was a cool morning with solid gray sky overhead. It
was also raining lightly, but the foliage blocked most of the drops.
Earlier as I was eating my oatmeal, Westland I talk to about the
fact that we already smelled bad. Wesley mentioned hearing that if you smelled
like ammonia; it means you are burning muscle tissue. I considered this, and I
thought that it was likely this was happening to me. Despite eating well when
in town, the last three times I had weighed myself I had gotten progressively
lighter by 2 or three pounds each time. In Roanoke, I was 172 pounds. I have
not been this light since 1991.
This morning we had also discussed our strategy for the day. In
the morning we would climb Dragon's Tooth, which several northbound hikers had
said would be a challenging climb. After that we would have an opportunity to
shelter about 14 miles from our start. We considered that probably was too
short for the day. There was another shelter at 24 miles from our start, and we
thought that might be too far for the day. Between the two shelters there was a
mountain on which we should see the monument to Audie Murphy, one of the most famous
soldiers of WWII. He had been assigned to the 3D Infantry Division,
and there were constant reminders of his actions during my assignment in that
unit. My hard copy guide book did not list them, but my Gut Hook app on my
phone showed campsite on both the near and far side of that intermediate
mountain top. Thus, we initially planned that we would camp at one of those
sites. Everything is subject to reassessment later in the day, of course.
The morning's hike once again took us along, back and forth
atop a long, narrow ridgeline oriented roughly northeast to southwest.  Around 9:15 a.m., it began to rain harder and consistently, and
the ground which had been mostly dry previously became steadily wetter and more slippery. By 9:30 I was fairly well soaked through. However, this being a Virginia trail, generally speaking it was smoother and better maintained than trails I
had hiked in other states. So we still made pretty good time. After reaching Route 624 at about 10:30am, we were able to take a .3 mile off-trail diversion to a gas
station to refill our water bottles. Wesley and I also decided to share a pizza for lunch at the convenience
store. We consulted our notes and decided to modify our plan for the next few
days. We got just a little more food, so instead of stopping in Newport
Virginia as tentatively planned, we would aim to stop in Pearisburg Virginia instead. We spent just over an hour at
the convenience store and then headed out again sometime around 11:30. We
walked the .3 miles back to the trail and headed up the steep incline to the
south.
On my map I noticed that the trail paralleled the path I must
have taken several years ago when I climbed here with my family. Jenna and I
had joined Joey and several of his college friends for the climb up Dragon's Tooth from the parking lot below. The path I was taking now along the
Appalachian Trail ran along the top of a serpentine ridgeline which paralleled
the path taken by the trail from the parking lot, through the valley just north
of us and below. I remembered that at that time, probably sometime in the Fall
of 2013, I had been 35 to 40 pounds heavier than I had weighed when last on the
scale a couple days ago. That meant that I was basically carrying as much
weight, with no backpack then, as I was now with my full backpack!
The final ascent was difficult, but it was great to see the
actual ""tooth"" on top.  I remembered being there with Joey and
Jenna.  I took pictures. There, we also saw BFG (whom I had met previously in the
100 mi wilderness, in Maine).  We chatted, and then we continued south.
The climb down was not as difficult, but it was rocky and
slippery.  Then we climbed up again, to reach Mount Brush and the monument
to Audie Murphy at the very top. there was a monument to America's most
decorated soldier from World War 2. He had died in a plane crash at that site
on May 28th, 1971. The area around the monument was decorated with piles (cairns) of
small rocks and with a multitude of items of memorabilia from
hikers and soldiers. We stopped there for a few minutes, and Wesley took my
picture.  After a short stay, we continued on and soon climbed down,
continuing south. 
We continued hiking down. It has been a long, cold wet day and I
was tired and sore. My feet ached.  My knees we're also sore from the
climbing particularly my left, which felt like I must have strained the
ligaments on the outside of the joint. We decided to stop at the first of the
upcoming campsite on the way down. However, when we got there we were not impressed and decided to push on to the second campsite. However, its location was not clearly identifiable and we were not satisfied speculating about what might be the site, so had not settled on that plan. Meanwhile the clouds had begun to break and
spots of sunshine were appearing. With the sun came some warm, and as
I began to dry off my spirits lifted somewhat. So, we decided to journey on and
stop at the Niday Shelter. We arrived there about 6:30 p.m.  Ben and BFG
showed up about an hour later. I took off my wet shoes, and I made and ate
dinner. After updating the text of my trail journal, I checked for cellular
reception, but I found nothing. Posting my journal would have to wait until
sometime tomorrow. 
Oh, the Niday shelter is at southbound mile marker 1504 point
something. So, sometime yesterday before our final road crossing I passed my
1500th mile on the Appalachian Trail! About 685 miles to go.","John's Spring Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577270,"It was cold last night. Probably in the 40s.  I slept well from about 8 p.m. until shortly after midnight. I think I tossed and turned the rest of the night. Hi got up between 6:30 and 7 a.m.  Ben and BFG had just gotten up, & I heard wisely say it's cold out there. Ben replied, ""Yes, but if not so bad with the right clothing. I'm wearing everything."" Picture. I put on my puffy jacket, & I pulled on my rain pants. I had forgotten to hang my rain pants and jacket up to draw last night so they were damp.  Wearing the now would allow me to use body heat to accelerate the drying process, but it would provide less Comfort. I made breakfast and packed up kama putting away my puffy jacket and exchanging the wet socks I had one yesterday for dry ones. For breakfast I had oatmeal and hot coffee. I noted that the canister of fuel I was using was the same one that Joey had used when he hiked with me. It was running low, but it was not yet empty. I was impressed again with the fuel efficiency of the jet boil. However, its ignition system was failing again. I made a minor adjustments to the spark gap, and tested it. It sparked reliably,  but it still did not light automatically. I used a Bic lighter to get it going. I think it may just have been lower fuel pressure that was the problem. We will see.
About 745 am I went across the trail to a spring where someone had installed a green leaf in a manner that made it function as a spout.  I usually collected hand treated to liters of water. I then started hiking South about 8:05 a.m. Wesley had already set out, and Stewart, who had camped at the river 2 miles back, caught up and passed me before I finished treating my water. I put my rain pants back in my pack, but I continue to wear my rain jacket for about a half an hour, until it would mostly dry and I was beginning to sweat, which would of course make it wet again. So then I stopped and put it back in my pack as well. It was still cold, and my hands were read from the exposure, but the Sun was shining, & I knew that it would soon be warm out.
As I hate slowly, my left knee warmed up, and it was no longer painful. However, I decided that I should be deliberate about taking it a little easy today so as not to further aggravate the situation.
The morning hike started up and a 1800 foot climb over the course of about 2 1/2 miles. It was not as difficult as yesterday's climbing. It ended at a marker for the eastern Continental Divide (picture), at which point began a6 mile Ridge walk.
I got to the sarver Hollow shelter between 1030 1045. Wesley and Stewart were at the intersection with the side trail. It was .4 miles to the shelter so we decided not to go there. After a very short break for me, we continued South. After about 2 and a half my house the trail emerged into a pastor. The ground was occasionally spotted with couch chips. I was careful not to step on these. Haha. Shortly thereafter, I arrived at a spot where there was an old tree known as Keffer oak. This is apparently the largest Oak Tree on the Appalachian Trail, and it is over 300 years old. Picture.
Shortly after that, I came to sinking Creek. Wesley was there, and we stopped to have lunch. So sometime shortly after noon, I started back down the trail to the south. Although actually, it was uphill. Be afternoon climb started gradually, up Andover a hill in a large pasture, on the other side of the creek. At the base of the hill on the far side, the trail crossed Virginia route 42. Then as the trail met this side of the next Ridgeline, it went up a total of another 1800 feet. About halfway up, I arrived at the Laurel Creek shelter. I stopped for a snack break. Then I continued at about 1:45 p.m.
Sometime before 2:30, the trail leveled out and I saw a sign for Kelly knob view. I took the 120 yard so I trail, & I found a formation of large rocks, but the trees below had grown so tall that there was no longer really any view. I took a picture of Mr lippy (Wesley) standing on the rocks. Then we both continued hiking South.
The trail continued with relatively little elevation game or loss for about two miles. Then it begin to slope downward.  As I continued toward the gravel road and a parking lot I passed a young woman who was hiking up. We said hello and just continued. When I got to the parking lot shortly after that I saw one car with a Virginia Tech sticker on the back. So likely the only woman in a hit seeing was either a current student for an alumnus. 
As I continued past that parking lot the trail re-entered the forest and proceeded downward across a steep slope of mountainside. This was my least favorite part of today's hike. The trail was overgrown with stinging Nettles, and they were not kind to me. The trail was also nearly washed out in several places and very narrow making it difficult to negotiate in other places it was very Rocky, sloped, and narrow. Here I was glad that today's son had mostly dried off the rocks so this was much safer than it would have been doing yesterday's rain. 
After about a half mile I came to a dried up Creek bed, & I noticed the vegetation was similar to that around the Laurel Creek shelter I had passed earlier today. This area seemed to me like a rhodadendrun jungle. However now I also had learned to differentiate between the taller Rodadendron, which I knew would bloom with pink flowers, and the smaller mountain laurel plants, which I knew would bloom with wife flowers. Pictures.
Sometime after 4 p.m. I reached the base of that descent. I stopped at a creek to fill and treat to liters of water. I would carry 3 from here to the shelter, and if necessary I would get more there. Shortly after that, I passed a campsite and a parking lot. Then, as I crossed Virginia route 632, I started another upper climb, and again this proceeded through pastor before we answering the woods. At about 4:45 p.m. I arrived at the war spur shelter.

He had stayed at the angels rest Austell in Pearisburg, and he gave us tips on the trail as well as in update on the weather. It like hurricane Irma was bigger and stronger than any hurricane yet recorded. It also look like we would have significant rain about Tuesday. This meant we might want to rethink our plan for stopping in Pearisburg on Saturday, and we might want to try to get to the lickhollow hostel,  about 30 miles further.
From there to the Bailey gap shelter, the trailer and mainly across a very uneven Rocky Ridgeline. This was difficult hiking. I reach the Bailey gap shelter at sometime between 11 and 11:30 a.m., & I stopped there to have lunch. Was Lee was also there. After lunch we headed south again. Just as we were getting on the trail Stewart showed up. We hiked South together for a while, and eventually separated as we hiked at different paces. As I was going down the trail I saw a call tree that reminded me of a conversation I had head with Stewart this morning. He had explained that the previous afternoon where we had seen small trees bent over to the ground, this was because Bears were bending these sassafras trees in order to eat the berries which grow at the top. I asked him how to identify the sassafras, and he showed me one with a distinctive leaf with three lobes. Picture. He also showed me that the route has a distinct to smell. Apparently it is often used in tea although recent wisdom indicates it might be carcinogenic.
Sometime between 12:30 and 1 p.m. I passed the pine swamped branch shelter. It was closed due to the danger of standing dead trees, killed by gypsy months. About a mile further kept the trail, I saw Wesley had stopped to eat lunch. He was near a good water source, so I stopped too, and I filled a second and third liter are of water and treated them. I've been continued South. It was just before 1:30 p.m. I talked to Wesley briefly. I estimated that we were a little more than halfway to our intended destination. It had taken about 5 hours of hiking to get this far. Therefore I estimated we might make our destination around 6 p.m., if the conditions ahead were similar to those behind.
I kept hiking all afternoon on a long ridgeline.  It was rocky at first, then it got easier.  Along the way I met nobo hiker Marlin. He warned me there was a rattle snake about a mile further up the trail.  I continued carefully, but I did not find the snake.  (Just as well).  
About 5p.m., I saw two backpacks by a tree. Then I noticed two lady hikers in their 60s, down the hill to the left.  I also saw a sign that said, ""water"" so i went down to look at what they said was a slow supply.  It was in fact just a trickle coming from a small black pipe.  I had not filled water since 10 miles back, but I still had almost 3 full liters of water. So, I continued hiking.  About 5:30, I caught up with another sobo hiker who was singing as she hiked.  As I passed her, we introduced ourselves.  She was Andwyn (elvish twist on her own name, Anna).  She was headed for the same shelter, so we would meet again there. 
I reached the top of Peters Mountain and Rice field shelter about 600pm.  Wesley showed up next.  Then Andwyn a bit later.  Then the other two ladies (Story Collector = Andwyn's mom, and Dusk, a friend of theirs).
After, it was a normal evening, and a nice sunset. Pictures.","War spur shelter

I showed him a peach tree that I had found the evening prior and from which I had eaten several pieces. They were small but the taste of fresh fruit was amazing. Picture.
The hike down up down to Pearisburg was relatively easy. And around 10:30 kama we were crossing the New River. The bridge provided a sidewalk next to a busy divided four lane highway called New River access road. And under it ran several runs of railroad track on both sides of the river.
Shortly after that, we got to the route 100 trailhead.  We hitch-hiked into town and went to the angels rest hostel.  Laundry,  shower,  lunch at a Mexican place, then resupply shopping at food lion.  Relaxing afternoon.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577406,"I got up this morning at 6 a.m. and made coffee. Wild drinking my first cup, I scrounge around the hiker kitchen and found leftover Aunt Jemima waffle mix, the rest of the ingredients in the waffle recipe, & a waffle iron. I mixed a batch of waffle batter, and I cooked myself a batch of for waffles and smothered them with Aunt Jemima syrup. Then I SAT and ate them. What is Lee and Stewart had just arrived in the common area and I pointed out the coffee and better. Stuart had a cup of coffee and Wesley had some waffles as well. Then we all finished packing and around 8 a.m. got shuttle service back to trailhead.
Yesterday Stewart had evidently hiked a mile further than Wesleyan die before he got off the trail at the less traveled cross Avenue trailhead. So that was where he started this morning. Wesleyan I, on the other hand, we're taking back to the 100 trailhead. Former hiker and hostile assistant ""rabbit"" was our driver. Picture. Yesterday we had also met hiker and hostile assistant "" Sartec"" (search and rescue technician), but he was not up yet this morning.
It was cool and overcast when we started. There was even a significant amount of fog around ground level. I remember yesterday morning that we had started out above the clouds, & I realized that right now we were probably simply be nice or in them. So, I figured it would remain overcast for us until either the sunburned off the clouds as it had done while we were hiking downhill yesterday, or we hiked above them. The initial morning hike was 2200 feet of climbing, over the course of 3.5 miles. At first this was over asset of relatively gentle switch backs, but then it got steeper for the last mile.
Around 9 a.m. I could small brakes in the trees that I was no above most of the clouds and sunlight was casting shadows on the trail. By about 9:30 I was near the top of the climb, and I heard Wesley's voice. He told me that the view was worth it, a couple minutes walk to my right. So I followed the blue arrow and came to a boulder. At this viewpoint, I could see down into the valley and observed that most of the clouds had disappeared, though some remained. Picture. I think was Lee had been on top of a boulder above my location when I had heard him, and I think he was describing a different view than the one from which I took pictures. However, I could not locate a trail to the point from which is voice head originated. So I continued hiking after I got back to the trail.
About 945, I came to the actual top of the climb, & I reached viewpoint from which I took some more pictures of beautiful scenery to the south.
I caught up to Wesley at about 11 a.m. As he was taking a break to fix his backpack. He said he had just torn his puffy jacket again. I passed him and continued hiking. We both arrived at the doc's knob shelter about 11:45, and we stopped for lunch. We were back on the trail at 12:15.
About 130 I caught up to Wesley who was talking to Stewart, who was on a rock on the side of the trail, eating his lunch. We chatted there for a little while, and then we continued hiking. At about 2:45, I came to a nice view to the southeast, & I took a couple pictures. Otherwise the rest of the day was mostly uneventful hiking on relatively easy terrain. I arrived at the Wapiti shelter about 345pm. I got water so that I would have 4 full leaders for the evening and tomorrow morning. And we had an ordinary evening.
Tomorrow we would take to root 608 in order to go to the lickskillet hostel, where we would shelter from the approaching tropical storm or hurricane or whatever it would be by the time its effects hit the area around southern Virginia.

Packed up, breakfast, took some pictures of our tents.  On the trail between 7:45 and 8 a.m. I got pictures of other campers who joined us after, dinner last night. They were:  ""Bearclaw"" a nobo hiker doing a section to Buena Vista. His real name was Dave Bosman; he's a retired computer programmer.  He and his son wrote a book about their hike.  
""Omega,"" a slim young guy with long dark hair, a nobo.
""Nature Boy"" who was a sobo hiker from Denmark. He said he was glad to meet me because he had read my entries in log books for a long time.  We talked about where we might have crossed paths.
Reached Dismal Falls just before 10:00.  A nice swimming hole, on another day, maybe. 
Continuing south, we came to Route 608 about 12:30p.m.  I called the hostel there, at Lickskillet Hollow, and Mongo came to pick us up.  He had hiked parts of the trail before but not finished.
At the hostel, I met ""Dream Catcher"" and Lobo, from Vermont.  The former was probably a little older than me, and the latter was a young person in his 20s. 
Later two older women joined the group: ""Dee Baggins"" and ""Pam"".
While Mongo was out picking them up, another guy joined us.  This was ""Wallstreet"" -- someone we had met the previous afternoon, but he had moved on and not stayed at the Wapiti shelter.  
We went to the store in Bland for resupply, and got lunch while we were there.  Later, we watched the TV for news about the hurricane (Irma).  Predictions of rain for tonight, maybe high wind.  Tomorrow uncertain.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577675,"Up around 6 a.m. Hostel morning routine. Montego took us to breakfast at Trent's grocery, and then he dropped Wesley, Stewart, & me off at the trailhead. We were headed south around 8 a.m.
Today's hike would be relatively level with lots of smaller ups and downs throughout the day. The initial mile was mostly uphill, but it was gradual. Sometime during that climb, I was stung by a bee on the back of my left calf. It surprised me and hurt a lot. I tried to ignore it for about a half an hour but eventually I stopped and applied some hydrocortisone. Because I was also sweating a lot by this time, I also changed from my long sleeve shirt into my short sleeve shirt. It had been completely overcast when we started, but now the sun was shining through the trees. We could not see from the top of the ridgeline down into the valley because the clouds obscured the view.
I met sobo lasher (South Bound Long Ass Section Hiker) Crazy Wolf sometime around 9 a.m. (picture) He was hiking from Harpers Ferry to North Carolina, so he had about 150 miles to go.
Because I had taken a break for hydrocortisone and t-shirt, & I had stopped to talk to Crazy Wolf, I had fallen behind Wesley and Stewart, who had continued on. So now I was hiking solo. The forest was quiet. It was damp with all the rain from the tropical storm that had affected this area for the last 2 days. But now The Sun was beginning to dry things. I noticed that on the top of the Ridgeline now there was an increased number of what appeared to be small longleaf pine trees as well as the typical oak trees that I had been seeing a lot of throughout Virginia. However here there were very few bro did and rings and only a small number of mountain laurel. This gave the trail more of a forest feel as opposed to a jungle atmosphere.
While hiking I called crazy Larry's hostel in Damascus Virginia to check on availability for about a week from now. It look good I also ordered a new pair of trail runners and I knew pair of super feet inserts to be delivered to Larry's. I also talked to Teresa about sending my cold weather clothes there. Teresa also set me pictures of additional food items I still had at home and I asked her to send me some of those as well. I also made a couple of additional phone calls, so I was not hiking quite as quickly as normal. Therefore I remained behind Stewart and Wesley.
Around noon I caught up to them as they were sitting at the intersection with the side trail that would go to the Helvey's Mill shelter. Apparently Wesley had been there for a while and head already eaten lunch from his food bag. Stewart on the other hand had arrived only recently and intended to stop at the outpost in bland that Mongo had told us about. Apparently it was to be found right on the trail about 2 miles from where we were. So, Stewart and I headed back out on the trail to the south. It did not take long for Wesley to catch up with us. We hiked together a mile or two on our road which crossed interstate 77. Picture.
We arrived at the Brushy Mountain outpost at about 1 p.m. we stayed and had lunch and purchased a gallon of water from which to refill our water bottles. There was no Freewater here. After lunch we resume our hike at about 1:30 p.m. the afternoon hike was much like the morning relatively smooth and gradual inclines up and down.
Hi noted that there was a minor increase in the number of trees and branches blown down onto the trail. This was very likely due to the wind and rain from the tropical storm. However it was relatively minor. I also noted that increasingly it was this year's phone leaves that I was now seeing blown on to the trail. Prior to southern Virginia it had almost exclusively been last year's falling leaves which covered the trail, & I remember observing listen thinking about it back in April. Now it seems we were seeing mostly brown and yellow but also some red leaves from some of the trees which appear to lose them earlier than others. The mountain laurel and Rodadendron appeared to be one of these. Its leaves we're always Brown or yellow on the trail.
I could not identify the tree that was the source of the red leaves I saw lying on the trail.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577707,"Got up this morning around 6 and took my time with a normal routine. I got a picture of the two hikers who had joined us last night: Crush, who was probably in his forties, an Investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and Gringo, a 30-something with a big sombrero. Both were Mechanical Engineers. Crush was hiking north to the Lickskillet Hostel where he had parked his truck. Then he would return to work. Gringo was also hiking north, but he explains that this was temporarily backwards because he was a soobo who had started at Katahdin in Maine. He had had to jump south and hike some sections backwards in order to link up with a friend who is going to join him in Daleville.
Anyway, we got on the trail about 8:15 a.m. Stewart and I hiked together for a while.  At about 10:15, I saw two black bear Cubs slide down out of trees directly adjacent to the trail about 15 feet away, and run off down the hill into the woods, presumably to link back up with their mother. So, my bear count for this hike is now at 8.
The trail was wet today from a light and steady rain. It was also completely overcast, so there were no views from the high points.
We stopped for lunch at the Chestnut Knob Shelter at about 12:45 p.m. and we were back on the trail headed south at about 1:15 p.m. IT had gotten cold and windy, so I wore my windbreaker on top of my t-shirt. An hour and 3.3 miles later, I had come down almost 2000 feet in elevation. The misty fog was now replace by good visibility. And the cold wind was replaced by warmer and relatively still air. Everything was quiet, dark and damp, and the leaves on the trees were not moving. However, I was much more comfortable in these conditions, & I stopped to remove my windbreaker and have a snack.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577719,"I didn't sleep so well last night. I got dehydrated as a result of being too warm under my sleeping bag. I drank a whole liter of water during the night in order to try to fight this, so I had to get up 3 times during the night. I also took some Motrin around 3 a.m. because of the dehydration related headache.  I think it's important to note that this was no worse than many nights I have had at home in my own bed with exactly the same symptoms. So there's nothing here that can be blamed on being on the trail. Anyway, I got up around 6 a.m. and went about the normal pack up and breakfast routine. Except that this morning Stewart cooked hot water for all of us on his alcohol stove. That way Wesley and I could save canister fuel in case we would not be able to resupply that until Damascus.  I used the hot water for coffee and rehydrated oatmeal packets with cold water to round up my breakfast.
We started hiking at just before 7:30 a.m. Plan today was to stop for lunch at a restaurant near the point where the trail would cross back over Interstate 81. That point is inside the limits of the town of Atkins, Virginia, as it is labeled on my map.
It was cool and overcast when we started. The trail went up and down through forests and a few cow pastures. I took some pictures in one of the pastures, where I had seen cows and wildflowers. Grateful for some color on this rainy day. Otherwise the hike was uneventful and the sun began to come out somewhere between 10:30 and 11 a.m. Around noon I was in yet another cow pasture, but this one had neither cows nor the fresh cow manure as seen where we hiked earlier in the day. At this point I could hear the sound of traffic on the interstate.
About 12:30, we reached the outskirts of Atkins, VA and then crossed under Interstate 81. (Picture).  Shortly after that, Wesley and I stopped at a convenience store where we were able to pick up some more food (enough to make it to Damascus).  That's when I noticed that the Mexican restaurant we had heard about was actually right inside the same convenience store.  So, we stopped and had lunch, ordering to-go burritos for dinner.  I was able to recharge my phone there.  After lunch, we repacked our backpacks and hiked the remaining 4.5 miles to the Chatfield shelter, where we stayed for the night. 
Hiking south from the Mexican restaurant at about 2:45 p.m., the trail went south on US Route 11 for about a quarter mile and then went into the same sort of terrain that we'd hiked on the other side of I-81. These were fields and woods with gentle up and down slopes. At about 3 p.m., I met nobo hiker Iron Heart. We talked for about half an hour. He calls himself a flip flopper, and was presently hiking from Damascus to Harpers Ferry. He said he hikes slowly, and had started out nobo from Springer and then at some point went sobo from Katahdin.  But because it was getting later in the year and he was concerned about the approaching winter, he had decided to return to the south and head nobo again. He hoped to get to Front Royal by Halloween, and ultimately to Harpers Ferry before it got too cold to hike. He would take his time doing the remaining sections.
Iron heart and I also had Army experience in common. He was in for 10 years and got out as an E6 on the E7 promotion list. He had been a linguist and analyst. He was now using translating those skills to analyze customer behaviors and make business recommendations to large companies looking to optimize sales. We shared information about the sections of trail we had hiked recently. He said that Grayson Highlands would be upcoming for me, an area with free roaming ponies. He also spoke about the Roan Highlands, as well as the Smokies. He also gave me his business card, which he carried as part of his Hike for a Cause. He had been a survivor of a sudden heart attack, and he had pieces of iron in his heart; hence his trail name. We both took selfies together, and he showed me some pointers regarding the use of my phone as a camera in voice activated mode with a delay timer. He had the same phone. (Picture)
At about 4 p.m. I passed the Early Settlers Museum of Atkins. (Pictures)  Arrived at the Chatfield shelter about 6 p.m., filled water from nearby stream.  Burrito from town for dinner. Normal evening.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577866,"I got up around 6 a.m. and then morning routine was very much like yesterday. We were on the trail before 7:30 a.m.. It was cool when we started, but by 8:30 a.m. the sky was clear blue and sunny. Where we were hiking there was a substantial green canopy provided by a variety of trees, so it was still cool at trail level.
I came to the Mount Rogers Visitor Center about 10:15 a.m., and stopped to charge my phone and get a Dr Pepper from the vending machine. I talked with the lady inside about Grayson Highlands and Mount Rogers hike. Then I met up with Wesley and Stewart who were both already there. They left to continue hiking around 11 a.m.  I followed separately around 11:15 and as I picked up my pace, I later passed the others.
At two points during the day I passed signs warning hikers about angry Yellow Jacket nests on the trail ahead. In both cases I found a way around through the woods. The first of these was a sign set on the trail by another hiker, but the second was actually yellow warning tape used to block off the trail, installed by trail maintainers. In both cases it appeared that a bear had dug up the nest in order to eat the larvae.
At 3 p.m. I stopped on a hilltop to take a break and have a late lunch. I was hiking much faster and covering more miles than usual.  I spent a half an hour there, and no one else showed up. So I kept hiking south, but more slowly. I came to this spot where a campground was supposed to be, but it was blocked off. Trail maintainers had stacked dead wood which one could use to access a flat clearing. It appeared they were trying to revitalize that area, and it seemed it was no longer an official campsite. So I decided to backtrack rather than wait here for the others. I hiked back to the ridgeline where I had eaten lunch, only about a half mile, and I saw Stewart coming. He said Wesley was just behind him. We walked back down the trail and found another path on which there was a different campsite about .2 miles off the trail. Here there was a pretty old picnic bench with moss growing on it. We decided to make that our camp site for the night. I was glad to have a place to stop and companions to stop with.
We found a small stream and I was able to use a Rhododendron leaf as a funnel so that we could collect water more easily. (Picture) I had seen these before, made by other hikers. This was my first. I laid up my tarp on a piece of flat ground, and I checked to make sure there were no dead trees or dead branches that could fall on our camp site.

Buy red light I started to pack up and break camp. About 10 minutes later Stewart was up and shortly after that so was Wesley. I switched to white light. When I was about 85% packed up (I still had my puffy jacket on, because it was cold), I got down our bear bags and started making breakfast. I was on the trail shortly after 7 a.m.
About 8 a.m. I crossed the footbridge over what the guide book calls a ""powerful waterfall"" through the rhododendron jungle. Picture.
Stewart caught up with me as I was finishing up my journal entry for yesterday. We hiked together for a while and were talking not realizing we had taken a wrong turn and hiked .4 miles off the trail. We turned around and headed back to the trail and continued. During this time Wesley had gotten ahead of us. We caught up to him when stopped for lunch at the Old Orchard shelter about noon.
About 1 p.m. I entered a corral around which there were free roaming Longhorn cattle and people riding horses. Pictures. As I climbed the hill on the far side of the corral, I could see in several directions that much of the foliage had begun to change color in the surrounding hillsides. Pictures.
About 2:30 p.m. I entered the Grayson Highlands State Park and I caught up to Wesley at the White shelter. We hiked for a little while and then got some water at a creek. We knew there should be water at the Thomas Knob shelter, but we wanted to be sure. It seems we hiked quite a while before we emerged from this woods into a region of smaller bushes and trees covering the surrounding hillsides. I climbed a large rocky outcropping and took some pictures in a panorama. After hiking I saw some ponies and walked over near them for photos.
Continuing south, we began to climb again after leaving the open area of the highlands and crossing into more rocky terrain.  We went through an area known as fat man squeeze, which reminded me of the lemon squeezy in southern New York State. However, this one was not as narrow and I actually didn't even need to take my pack off to go through it. At about 4:30 we arrived at the Thomas Knob shelter. There was a good water source just to the west where maintainers had constructed a corral to keep horses from dropping manure on the area that would leach into the water supply. At the downhill end of this area was a 2 inch PVC pipe running into a spring which was flowing freely. I filled my remaining water bottles there.
As the evening progressed for dinner time, more hikers joined us.  There were two different sets of two women, one group of which stopped only to leave their packs so that they could hike up and back from the summit of Mount Rogers about .7 miles away. Then they continued their hike. The second group stayed but did not have trail names. One was from the Shenandoah Valley, and the other was from Denver and they had met at college in Pennsylvania. They were just doing a day circuit and had come from their car about 7 miles away. There was also a guy on a day a hike whose name I didn't get either. And there was a long distance hiker whose trail name was Sale. She was a 25 year old woman who had started hiking in Alabama and connected some trail there with the Benton McKay trail in Georgia to eventually join the Appalachian Trail. It was not clear to me exactly what her destination was. I heard her discussing it with others as I was falling asleep, but I did not stay awake long enough to hear all the story. There was also a father/son team. The man appeared to be in his late 30's, and the boy appeared to be about 12 years old.
The shelter was rather large, and it had an upper deck as well as a main floor. Each floor could hold 8 people. The Father/son team decided to tent rather than stay in the shelter. The rest of us stayed inside, men on the first deck, and the women took the upper deck.
It was a starry night, clear and cold.  I was surprised how much dew accumulated on things left outside after it got dark. Wesley's sleeping bag had been hanging on a branch in the sun, but when he brought it in after dark, it was soaked. I could also hear water dripping off the roof all night despite the fact that the sky remained clear and there was no rain.

After breakfast and chatting, we hiked a short distance south to a side trail which went to the summit of Mount Rogers. It was about 1/2 mile each way. I took a picture of the survey marker at the peak. After returning to the trail we continued south.
Along the way, when I had enough signal to do so, I stopped to call the hostel in Damascus and confirm my arrival for tomorrow. I also asked about a pharmacy where I could pick up prescriptions, and the hostel operator provided a name and phone number. I called my doctor next, to arrange for the delivery of the prescriptions I needed to that pharmacy. I hiked through the woods and across more fields. Pictures. As I hiked I wondered if the increase in elevation had something to do with the increased degree to which the foliage had changed colors. Last night's Thomas Knob shelter was at about 50,340 feet elevation, just over 1 mile high.
After reaching the base of climb, I went through an open field, across a road and parking lot and entered the woods to climb up the other side of the valley. Next I hiked through another field, across a gravel road and down into yet another field. Pictures. There I stopped to get water at a fast flowing spring. I also met a day hiker who had picked up the trail name Night Stranger when he hiked on the PCT. Picture.
At several points throughout this morning, and yesterday, I could see far to the south that there were mountains much larger than those we had been climbing on. I wondered which ones they were, far enough away to be in Tennessee. 
At another point in one of these highland fields, I climbed a rocky out cropping and got some pictures of the 360 degree Panorama. There was a group of three day hikers there and we chatted for a few minutes and then moved on. From there the trail continued to go up and down through forests and fields at a relatively mild grade.
I stopped at the Lost Mountain Shelter for lunch around 1 p.m. Wesley and Stewart were already there. Around 1:30 p.m. or so we continued hiking south. About 2:15 p.m. I crossed a large bridge dedicated to Luther Hassinger, who had evidently owned a sawmill and logging operation in this area in the early 1900s. On the bridge was a girl on a bike. She was taking a picture of something. As I got closer she explained that it was a black snake curled up in a rotten section of one of the cross beams supporting the bridge. So I took a picture of it to.
My first impression was that this wooden bridge was part of Forest Service road, but then seeing the dedication I thought perhaps it was a logging company road. This was a one lane gravel road about 50 feet above a creek bed. Below, along as side of the creek there was another gravel road along which were several wooden platforms with railings extended out over the water, about every 50 yards. As guessed, later a sign confirmed that this was for fishing. A little further down the trail I saw sign with a picture of a train on it, indicating that I was now joining what was called the Virginia Creeper Trail.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578134,"I got up when I woke up, around 5 a.m., and I started getting my stuff organized, final packing. Around 7 a.m. Wesley and I walked over to the mojo cafe, and we had breakfast there. After, we said goodbye, then he got a shuttle ride from the folks next door at and Outfitters. Then I walked back to Larry's and checked out. 
Next stop was the post office just after it opened at 8:30 a.m. where I mailed myself some of the excess items from my backpack that I didn't need anymore, like my bug net and so forth. Afterwards, I followed the white blazes through and out of town to the south. I took a picture of the town park near the point where the trail exits town to the south. Then, at about 9 a.m. I followed the trail between two houses and up into the woods, and I headed south again, solo.
Oh, last night while Wesley and I were relaxing on Larry's porch, through hiker ""Lost"" walked by. We chatted with her for a while. (Picture)
At about 10 a.m. I reached the Virginia/Tennessee border. (Picture) and arrived at the Abingdon Gap shelter at about 12:20. I stopped and had a quick lunch.
I kept hiking. It was a pleasant day, sunny and cool. The terrain was relatively gentle.  I arrived at the double springs shelter at about 4:15 p.m. I had passed a man and two women probably in their 60s, while I was on the way up the last climb to that shelter. They arrived there about 15 minutes later. Already there was also a couple, probably in their 50's. The man told me where to find water, and I filled all my remaining bottles. Both of these other groups were short section hikers, and they wanted to use their tent rather than stay in the shelter. I decided to keep going for a little while before stopping for the day. So I continued southward again at about 4:45 p.m.
About 5:30 I came to a high pasture with nice views of the surrounding countryside to the south east. (Pictures) After I continued through these fields, I crossed the road and reentered the woods. I could not decide if I wanted to camp or continue hiking to the Iron Mountain shelter. However, as it approached 6 p.m. I realized it would be dark before I arrived at the shelter, & I decided that it would be better to make and eat my dinner here where I was on the trail presently rather than to generate the smell of cooked food near where I might camp alone. The latter may invite animals to investigate. So, I stopped to sit on a large log and made my dinner and ate it. I could not find my bic lighter,  so I used my fire starter necklace to create sparks with which I lit my jet boil stove.  Eating my dinner also served to lighten my heavy food bag. I also consumed a litre of water in the process, and I decided to carry two liters as I hiked further.   
I passed some spots that I thought might make good camping. But either I just didn't feel it, or I saw dead trees and or dead branches overhanging the camp spots. So each time, I decided to keep going. I still had four more miles to hike to get to the Iron Mountain shelter. At dinner, I had taken out my headlamp and a spare set of batteries and prepared them for use in case I would need them.
About 730 p.m. I passed a monument to a local hermit named Nick Grindstaff.
It indicated that he had died in 1923 and I think the inscription at the bottom of the monument read ""he lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone.""
Arrived at Iron Mountain shelter about 8 p.m.  Two guys there:  M16 and Mage.  Dreamcatcher and Lobo had been here earlier, and DC gave them their trail names. The former was about to rejoin the active Army as an Infantryman, and had been a reserve MP.  He had deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 with 1st Infantry Division.  The latter was so named because he was carefully tending a campfire.
They moved some bags so I could fit in the shelter, and I quickly unpacked, hung my bear bag, and got ready for bed. M16 fell asleep as I was finishing setting my stuff up.  Mage stayed up and continued to tend the fire.","Crazy Larry's Hostel
",Iron Mountain Shelter,"Sep 20, Wed",26.30
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578191,"Got up this morning just before 4 a.m. upon hearing both M16 and Mage up and using their white lights. I thought it was around 5 a.m. By the time I figured out it was only 4:00, my sleeping bag was halfway stuffed into its sack already. So I kept packing, changed, had breakfast and was on the trail at about 5:30 a.m.
I tried to find water at a couple of documented water sources, but in the dark this proved too difficult, so I kept walking. Between 6:30 and 7 a.m. it got light enough to forego the headlamp. There were also a couple nice views, so I took some pictures.
I arrived at the Vandeventer shelter sometime after 8:15 a.m. and met two hikers there who had spent the night. This was ""Underpass"" and another guy whose trail name I cannot remember. They had started northbound from Springer in early August, and were hiking a section, hoping to get as far as Pine Grove Furnace State Park in Pennsylvania. I guess that would be about half way. They told me about the water source here, & I told them about the water source near the Iron Mountain shelter.
Looking at the guide, I decided I needed to get water before moving on despite the fact that these guys had said that it was running very slowly and was a long way off the trail, down a very steep path. So after bidding them farewell, I hiked south to the side trail. Then I hiked down the very steep trail, a long way, and eventually I found a little pipe with no water coming out of it. I had to mess around with its intake, but I was able to fix it and get a trickle flowing. I spent about 15 minutes filling two liters of water. Then I slowly hiked up the very steep long side trail, back to the Appalachian Trail, and I was headed south at about 9:15.
Around 11 a.m. I crossed Tennessee Route 91 and then climbed up a steep staircase into the woods. On a tree I saw a notice that the Watauga Lake shelter was closed due to aggressive bear activity. I also saw a federal order on a different tree that declared the entire region west of the lake to be closed for reasons of Public Safety. I presume that is for the same reason as the shelter closing. There were three exceptions to this prohibition: Federal authorities, law enforcement, and individuals hiking through and on the Appalachian Trail. So evidently it was okay for through hikers to go into and through the area where there was aggressive bear activity, but hikers were not allowed to stay in the area. After climbing up a hill beyond the signs, I climbed down the other side. Along the way I had some views of the lake. (Picture)
Around 11:30 I arrived at the dam. Constructed by the TVA between 1946 and 1949, it caused the formation of the lake. (Pictures) As I crossed the dam and continued hiking around the lake, I met nobo section hiker ""Cakes"" who was about to finish up his 14th and final section of the Appalachian Trail when he would arrive in Damascus in a few days. I stopped and talked with him for almost a half an hour. Then I continue taking around the lake.  I noticed several piles of bear scat, & I thought about how it would be difficult if I ran into a bear on that particular trail, given the steepness of the hill on the right hand side which fell off on the left hand side down to the lake. There was really nowhere to go to avoid an encounter if a bear happened to be on this section of trail.
It rained a little, about 1 p.m.  Otherwise, the trek around the lake was uneventful.  About 1:15, as I came upon the Boots Off Hostel, I decided to stay there. I had hiked only 16 miles, but that made 42 miles in two days.  I had also started really early today, and logged nearly 8 hours on top of yesterday's 11.  I was tired.  So, I checked in with Jim, the owner. Then I organized my stuff in the bunkhouse, took a shower and ate food from my food bag for lunch.","Iron Mountain Shelter
",Boots Off Hostel,"Sep 21, Thu",16.20
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578264,"There were several other hikers at the Boots Off Hostel yesterday and last night. This included section hiker Trail Stormer, as well as Sauce, whom I had met before I arrived in Damascus, and Flip. Flip and Sauce knew each other from the northbound part of their flip flop hikes. They had both started in May. But after reaching Katahdin, Sauce had gone to Harpers Ferry to hike south whereas flip went to Springer Mountain to hike north and here, near Hampton Tennessee at the Boots Off Hostile was where they crossed paths again. There were also several assistants at the hostel besides the owner, Jim. This included Glen, who appeared to be the one doing most of the building and mechanical work, hiker Jesus who was painting a large wall-sized mural of a view of a starry sky, and another individual whose name I did not get. The hostel itself was a residence with a common area including kitchen, charging stations and a large deck and fire pit on the back of it. There was a separate bunkhouse with room for 8 people and two separate cabins with room for 4 people each. In the shower building there were two showers constructed of buckets one would fill with mixed amounts of hot and cold water which then falls like rain - very nice! There was yet another separate building which looked like a privy but was actually a fully equipped 2-stall bathroom. In addition, the hostel business also operates as a campground with acres of primitive camping area.
I got up around 6 a.m., & I got my stuff together and moved it from the bunkhouse to the common area of the boots off hostel.  There I finished packing up and enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, including 3 cups of coffee. The owner, Jim, was about to shuttle section hiker  Trail Stormer to a trailhead. So, I took a picture with Jim before he left. I then talked to his assistant, Glen, for a while about his former experience as a director of information technology operations for a large financial firm. Then I headed out for the day. I was on the trail shortly before 8 a.m.
As I mentioned yesterday, my stop at the Boots Off Hostel was unplanned. I had really not needed any additional supplies, so I didn't get any. However, I did need the rest and I enjoyed that. My plan now was to take two days to reach the town of Roan Mountain. Tonight I hoped to reach the Mooreland shelter which would essentially split the 32 mile total distance in half. Then the following day after reaching the next town, I would stay at the Doe River hostel, and resupply with enough stuff to get me the next 50 miles to Erwin Tennessee where I would make my next resupply stop.
The first 3 miles of today's hike was a relatively easy climb of Pond Mountain. There were no views, as the trail was essentially a green tunnel, and the sky was completely blocked by fog and cloud. However it was relatively nice hiking conditions because it was cool and the trail was dry. 
By about 9 a.m. I was over the top of the first climb and on the way down. By 9:30 I began to hear the sound of rushing water coming from the valley below. By 10 a.m. the fog had burned off and a sunny, gorgeous day was unfolding. The trailhead become rock here as it switched back and forth across a steep slope in order to maintain a gradual grade for hiking. I was able to take some pictures through the trees of the steep hills on the opposite side of the valley.  Sometime before 10:30 the trail flattened out and went along a beautiful stream for several hundred yards and then crossed it on a nice wooden bridge. (Picture) On the other side of the bridge, the trail continued to follow the water upstream for a few hundred yards and then it crossed back over this stream on a similar foot bridge and again continued upstream.
Around 10:40 a.m. I came to the fork in the trail. The left branch would go to the Laurel Fork shelter and the high water bypass around Laurel Fork Falls. The right branch would visit the falls and was the continuing route of the Appalachian Trail. So, because I had no reason to visit the shelter or bypass the falls, I went to the right.
Around 11 o'clock, I reached Laurel Fork Falls itself. There were several day hikers here already. Like them, I stopped and took a break here. I sat on a log and ate a snack, as I watched the water cascade over the tall rock wall. (Picture) Then I continued hiking, and the trail became a steep staircase of large rocks. I climbed upward.  Shortly after that, maybe 15 minutes, the trail leveled back out somewhat to a more gradual grade above the falls.
The trail then proceeded through the ravine parallel to the path of the creek that feeds the falls. Is a beautiful day with amazing scenery. I took several pictures. Around noon I crossed a road and began the second major climb of the day. I reached the top of that around 1 p.m. About this time I was remembering that yesterday Flip had warned me about Yellow Jackets that had hurt him badly with about a half dozen stings on both legs, about 3 miles this side of the falls and shelter. Just as I reached for my phone to check the distance, I was stung in the back of my right leg. After brushing away whatever it was that had stung me, I hiked a little further and then stopped and checked and sure enough I was exactly 3 miles from the next shelter. I put my phone away and continued carefully.
After another half mile without incident I reached an  open field that had been recently mowed. It appeared this was a camping area. There was a sign indicating a water source nearby, but I decided to continue. Shortly after that, however, I saw an unmarked trail leading off to the left to what appeared to be a water source, & I decided I should fill up one more bottle before continuing because there would be no more reliable water between here and the shelter. I wasn't sure if I would stop at the shelter because it looked like it was going to be prior to 3 p.m. when I got there, and there was abundant water beyond the shelter. Having had a hard time finding water on a couple of previous occasions, I opted for the more conservative approach and stopped and filtered 1 liter.
I reached the Moreland shelter just before 2:30 p.m. I had not been hurrying or pushing hard all day long, I just got here sooner than anticipated. So I decided to keep going, again not sure how far. About 3:45 I crossed what my guide book called Hardcore Cascades. To me, it looked like a nice stream and water source. I didn't need water though.
Kept going.  Arrived Mountaineer shelter about 6 p.m. and had shelter to myself.  Got water, washed up, made dinner, got ready for bed.  Tried to scare away the mice and the bears.","Boots Off Hostel
",Mountaineer Falls Shelter,"Sep 22, Fri",24.40
GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578359,"Did I mention that I had the entire shelter to myself? The Mountaineer Falls shelter was big and had an interesting design. Actually had 3 floors, & I think it could probably accommodate 18 to 20 people. It also had a covered cooking and sitting area. Instead of the traditional picnic bench that I have seen in or around most shelters, this one had a perimeter tabletop and a bench to go with it. (Pictures coming when I have better signal) The shelter also had a statue of a bear.  The water source nearby was a fast flowing spring which filled a small pool at the top of a large rock face down which the water then cascaded.  It took only about 5 seconds to fill each liter bottle.
I think my loud yelling did scare away whatever creature it was whose eyes I saw peering into the shelter from outside last night. The mice however were not deterred! I had seen two of them, and I could hear them scampering about all night long.  
I got up around 6 a.m., did some preliminary packing, made breakfast then finished packing.  I was back on the trail as it began to get light enough to see - around 7 a.m.
Morning climb was uneventful. I went up and over the terrain between my start point and the trailhead for route 19E and the town of Roan Mountain Tennessee. Along the way, from the grassy meadows along the top there were some nice views of the mountains to the south, east and west. About 10:30 I could hear the sounds of traffic on the road about a half mile below. I was approaching route 19E. I knew that most of the rest of my day would be an uphill climb. I also knew that I would need to manage water carefully, as it would become more scarce at the higher elevations. I did not know how far I would be able to get. I calculated that if I maintained a moderate pace (better than two miles an hour) I might be able to get as far as the Roan High Knob shelter. That would be my stretch goal for the day, as it was 25 miles from my start point. More likely I might reach the Over Mountain shelter or the Yellow Mountain Gap campsite or maybe Jane Bald. Those places were between 18 and 22 miles from my start point.
When I left Damascus, I had planned to stop at the Doe River Hostel here in Roan Mountain. Here I would resupply in order to get enough stuff to make it to Erwin Tennessee and Uncle Johnny's hostel there. It was about 50 miles from here to there. However I now figured that because I had stopped at the Boots Off hostel, I still had about 3 days worth of food in my food bag, maybe a little more. I also figured I should be able to hike through to Erwin and arrive on the 3rd day. So I decided not to stop in the town of Roan Mountain.
The first half hour of the climb up Hump Mountain was relatively slow and easy. The second half, on the other hand was steeper and more difficult. Around noon I arrived at a clearing called Doll Flats. This place is significant for being the Tennessee/North Carolina border.  From here I took some pictures including a panoramic view to the south. For quite some distance while heading south, I'll be walking right on the border between the two states. I also want to note that North Carolina marks the 13th out of 14 states on the Appalachian Trail. Only Georgia remains after this.  Arriving to the top of the mountain about 1 p.m., and I stopped there for lunch.
About 2:30, after I had hiked down from Hump Mountain and up and over and down the other side of Little Hump Mountain, I reached the side trail for the Over Mountain shelter. (Picture) It was too early to stop for the day, but I needed water so I went down the side trail to the water source for the Over Mountain shelter. I filled and treated two one-liter bottles before returning to the side trail. At the intersection I found a sign that told history of how militias from Virginia, North Carolina, and what is now Tennessee had joined together on September 25th 1780, to resist the British. They were called the Over Mountain Men. Apparently this resistance occurred right down in the valley below the Over Mountain shelter. (Picture) After reading the sign, I continued hiking.
Sometime before 4:30, I reached Grassy Ridge bald. As the name implies, this was a grassy ridgeline. Beautiful to the east and west. Just after 4:30, I reached Jane Bald, and I took some more pictures.
There were some day hikers on Jane Bald. One of them heard me take a picture by telling my phone to ""Capture!"" and she exclaimed, ""What?!"" I explained how I'd recently learned how to do that with my phone and that it also works if I say, ""Smile!"" She asked what kind of phone I had, & I explained that it was a Galaxy S7. Again, she exclaimed, ""What?!"" She had the same phone, so I told her about turning on voice activation. Then I took a selfie of us with her phone. I took some more pictures as I continued down the south side of Jane Bald. Then I hiked up Round Bald. To the east the sky was getting dark and I could hear thunder much like yesterday. Several people had told me the weather forecast was for very little chance of rain around Roan Mountain, however it did start to sprinkle. The dark sky in the east looked rather ominous, but it made a great photo setting. When I got to the top of Round Bald just before 5 p.m., I found lots of day hikers tenting up there. I took pictures.
Given the time, and the fact that it was 2.1 miles to the top of Roan High Knob, I decided to keep going. I figured I could probably be there in a little over an hour. Then, as I came down the south side of Round Bald I saw the road and parking lot full of day hikers' cars, and I saw how tall and steep the coming climb would be. (Picture) My math showed that there would be lots of switchbacks.  That was good. I had met a lady at the Tannery shelter who had said the water was good at the top. I stopped near the bottom and filled a second liter, just in case. I would fill the others and have four, if there was in fact water on top. Then I set out for this last climb of the day. The first rounds of Route 19E had been the longest and highest, going from 2800 to 5600 feet.   That was to get to Hump Mountain. Then I had climbed down 600 and backup 500 to get to 5500 feet at Little hump. Then it had been down to 4700 feet at Over Mountain, and then back up to 5800 feet at Grassy Ridge Bald, but then it was down to the parking lot at 5600 feet, and now it was up to the top at 6200 feet.
I arrived at the shelter at about 6 p.m., and to my surprise Cuckoo was there. I had not seen her since my third day of hiking south from Harpers Ferry. Apparently, after being inspired to non-traditional hiking by ""Ireland"" who had also hiked out of Harpers Ferry with us, and after meeting a couple of day hikers at Raven Rock viewpoint, she had decided to visit her brother in Nashville Tennessee for the Eclipse. Afterwards, instead of returning to Virginia, she decided to go to Springer Mountain Georgia and hike northbound. So we were meeting again, entirely coincidentally. I had forgotten to do it at our last meeting, so this time I remembered to get a picture of the two of us together.
Cuckoo and I chatted for awhile and I made my dinner. She had already had hers. Then I finished unpacking and got ready for bed.","Mountaineer Falls Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578423,"It was cold last night, but the crisp air felt good and made the wrapped up sensation of being in my sleeping bag more pleasant. I slept well. I got up at about 6 a.m., made breakfast, packed up, chatted with and said farewell to Cuckoo. She left to hike down to the Carver's Gap Parking Lot 1 mile North where she would meet a friend who would hike with her for the next three days. Shortly afterward I hiked out southbound, at about 7:30 a.m.
It wasn't long before I got to the top of the southern summit of Roan Mountain. This was the site of a grand Hotel in the late 1800. Visitors would travel by narrow gauge train to the town of Roan Mountain where they would then take a carriage for the remaining 12 mile trip to the hotel. Today, all that remains are the ruins. One small chimney stands almost right on the trail, and there is a grassy field where the hotel itself once stood. Five years ago there were probably fantastic views from there, but today the surrounding trees have grown up enough to block most of the scenery. Pictures.
About 9:30 am I ran into a hiker going north, and we chatted for a few minutes. She asked, ""Are you GI Joe?""  And I said, ""Yes."" She said her trail name was Pickles, and she was going south as a flip flopper who started sobo from Harpers Ferry about a week after I did. She had been reading my entries in the shelter log books all along the trail. We talked about our hiking plans and who else we had seen on the trail. She said she was slack packing for today, but was in fact headed south now in general.
I stopped for a snack around noon when I reached the peak of Iron Mountain sometime before 12:30 p.m. It was fully wooded like most of the trail so far today, and it offered no views except what I could make out between the trees. I continued to walk slowly as I took some time to update my journal and upload pictures. Then, around 1 p.m. I called Uncle Johnny's Hostel in Erwin Tennessee in order to lock in a place to stay tomorrow night.
About 2:10 I reached a reliable water source just prior to the Cherry Gap shelter, so I drank the last of my second liter of water and filled, filtered and treated two more liters.  About 2:45 p.m., as I was approaching a rare viewpoint in today's hike, I heard some voices. One of them said, ""I said it was an animal."" I saw that it was three women. I said, ""It is an animal!"" And one of them exclaimed, ""It is a hairy beast!"" And yet another one said, ""But it looks like a friendly one!"" Hahahaha! I paused and took in the view for a moment and then wished the group of women a good hike, and moved on. 
Sometime for 3:15 p.m., I arrived at the Cherry Gap shelter. I was disappointed that there was no logbook to put my mark in. However, I was surprised to find Annawyn (sp?) there. Her mother, Story Seeker, also showed up before I moved on. I had last seen them at the Rice Field shelter in Virginia. It seems like a long time ago. Annawyn explains that they were doing flip flop sections. They had spent a couple days in Uncle Johnny D's Hostel,  and they liked it a lot. Her father had been able to join them there. She also explained that they had installed an electrical outlet and light switch in the Chestnut Knob shelter. I had seen this kind of joke at a number of different shelters, but I never knew who had done it. I got back on the trail about 3:40. My goal was to reduce the miles I would have to hike tomorrow to get to Uncle Johnny's, which was about 17 miles from the Cherry Gap shelter.
Sometime before 5 I reached the summit of Unaka Mountain. As I descended the southern side, I came to a campground where I saw two guys looking at a Christmas tree. This was not just a conifer. It was actually decorated with Christmas ornaments. On a nearby tree there was a poster indicating that this was a memorial to someone named Max Norell. Apparently Max, who had been born in 1994 died in May of 2016.  His loved ones evidently we're hoping that his spirit would continue to be able to touch people.
About 5:30 I reached Beauty Spot Gap, where there was a small parking area on a dirt road. Across from there was a small campsite, and adjacent to the campsite there was a blue blaze trail that went to a water source. I consumed the remainder of the liter I was working on and then I filled all of my bottles. Now carrying 4 full liters, more than 8 pounds of water, my pack was heavy. Then, I kept going.
I reached the top of Beauty Spot Mountain at about 6:10 p.m. As soon as I broke into the clearing I saw two women (one maybe 40s, the other 60-ish), a photographer and a young woman in a white nightgown-styled dress. They looked at me and giggled. I looked at the amazing vista in the background and said, ""Beautiful view, I approve."" They giggled again. The young woman in the white dress, the subject of the photographer, was Megan.  The two ladies standing by were Candy, and Shea, perhaps mom and grandmother. I asked if it was okay to take their pictures and they said sure. (Picture)
I headed a few hundred yards further into the center of the clearing and picked a campsite with views to both east and west. And then I set up for the night.  As I was setting up I saw the several other groups of people coming out and taking pictures of young women in the same style burgundy dress that Megan had now changed into. I asked one group about this and learned that this was a popular spot for high school senior year pictures.
After setting up I watched the sunset and made dinner and took pictures. Then I went to bed.","Roan High Knob Shelter

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578500,"I got up this morning around 5:30 a.m. It had been a windy night and I had been awakened on and off. At one point the wind pulled up the tent stake holding a line connected to the trekking pole at the foot end of my tarp. That end of the tarp collapsed on me, and I had to get up and stake it down again. While I was at it I collected some small rocks around the size of 10 pounds each, and placed them on top of the tent stakes at each line connected to my tarp. I guess that happened around midnight. After that I slept fairly well. After getting up, I started packing, made and ate my breakfast, finished packing, watched the sunrise, and took pictures. The sunrise this morning was as beautiful as the sunset was last evening. (Pictures)
One disadvantage of camping in the open here is that dew tends to collect on exposed surfaces, such as my tarp.  So when I rolled it up in the morning, it was damp. I made a note that I would need to dry it out later in the day. I started liking south around 7:15 a.m.
About 915, I arrived at the Curly Maple Gap shelter and stopped for a break. I signed the logbook with my usual, ""Next time, hooah!"" but I added two more lines: ""Too bad my food bag is empty! :-("" and ""Good thing there's Irwin! :-)."" Back on the trail just before 9:30 and very shortly thereafter, I met northbound section hiker Need. He was a retired Air Force pilot. I talked with him for a few minutes and then we wished each other good luck and moved on.
Arrived at Uncle Johnny's Hostel at about 10:45 a.m. and checked in. Stewart (Vanilla Thunder) was there. He had tented near the last shelter I passed before arriving at the hostel.  We shared stories of our troubles since before Damascus when we had last seen each other. Then I put my stuff in the private room that I rented. After laundry, and showering, I dried my tarp my sleeping bag and some other damp gear.  Then I caught the lunchtime shuttle to Pizza Plus with Stewart and two other hikers that were at the hostel. Their names were Rock Spider from Israel and Mike from Pennsylvania. We paid $7.50 for all the pizza and salad bar you can eat. Then I headed to other stores on the block, an IGA grocery store and Dollar General store for supplies. 
After lunch I retrieved my superfeet insoles from the hostel.They had arrived the day after I left the hostel in Damascus and Crazy Larry was kind to forward them to me here. I trimmed them to the right size, and I put them in my trail runners. I relaxed until it was time to catch the 5:30 shuttle to dinner. I caught up on some journaling and I watched some Netflix and rested.","Beauty Spot Mountain Campsite

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578606,"Over the course of the day yesterday, several more people showed up at Uncle Johnny's Hostel. This was sort of a mini reunion. Four of the people there were hikers I had met before. This included: 
Sauce, whom I had met north of Damascus and had seen again at the Boots Off Hostel.
Vanilla Thunder (Stewart), whom I had met on Tinker Cliffs south of Roanoke and with whom I had hiked for a couple of weeks along with Mount Lippy. I had not seen him since just north of Damascus.
Mike, whom I mentioned in yesterday's journal entry, but I did not know until dinnertime that his trail name was Big Foot. As soon as he told me that, I confirmed that he was in fact the same hiker I had met as I was  starting to climb Bear Mountain, NY in late April. It had been a hard few days for him and at that time was very discouraged. He said that he had thought several times about the things I said to him that day, and he decided he would try again after taking some time off and lightening his load. 
Ben, whom I had met a couple of times, and Moonlight I had last seen south of Dragon's Tooth somewhere. He had taken vacation from the trail to visit a friend in Roanoke. He now hoped to finish the trail by the 10th of October, hiking 25 to 30 miles a day.
Rock Spider, whom I had not met before. He was from Israel, and he got his trail name for the way hiked rocks in Pennsylvania, after he began his flip-flop hike at Harpers Ferry heading north.
I got up this morning just before 6 am, dressed, packed, microwaved a Jimmy Dean Breakfast I had purchased from the hostel last night, and ate that. Filled a couple water bottles. Said ""See you!"" at the trail to two other hikers who had not left for the day yet. Started hiking south at shortly after 7 am.
Today's hike began with a climb from the hostel elevation at 1700 Feet to 3200 ft. I took several pictures from nice view points. Throughout the day it would then be down, up, down, up and so forth, with at least three more thousand foot climbs to come. I completed the first climb by about 8 a.m. Then on the way down and up to the No Business Knob shelter, I met two hikers from France. They asked about resupply options north of them. I told them about Erwin and Uncle Johnny's. Their trail names were Jecca  (after some emperor of Indonesia) and Pigeon Woods (because he likes pigeons and he is in the woods). (Picture)
I arrived at the No Business shelter at about 9:45 a.m. I stopped for a snack and break and was back on the trail about 10 a.m.  I don't remember exactly when it was, but for the first time on my hike I actually saw an owl. It was perched on a branch near the trail and flew away when it heard me coming. I crossed a couple of roads, passed lots of water sources, and climbed up High Rocks Mountain. Then of course I climbed down the other side. There I passed a campsite called Whistling Gap, and crossed another road and began the climb up Little Bald Mountain. About 1 p.m. when I was about a mile from the top, I came to a spring and realized this was probably my last chance to get water before reaching the top of Little Bald, where I planned to eat lunch. So I stopped and got water. I had to improvise using the tube from my filter kit to create a Pipe Spring. (Picture)
Sometime around 1:45 p.m., I crossed the actual summit of Little Bald Mountain and didn't notice it. Apparently the actual bald spot is so little that it's possible to completely miss it, like I did. So I stopped maybe a quarter mile down the southern slope, & I had lunch sitting on a log just off the trail.  After lunch, I continued hiking for about a mile and came to the Big Bald Mountain shelter.  I was disappointed that the shelter had no log book, but I was impressed that it had a bear cable system, a privy, and a nice water source. I took a picture of the bear cable system, & I filled all my water bottles and treated each. I then took a break. Ben caught up, got water and continued on. Sauce caught up and went to get water. Sometime after 3 p.m. I continued down the trail to the south.
I wasn't sure where to stop for the night. Flip had recommended, when I talked with him about it at the Boots Off Hostel, that I should definitely consider staying on Big Bald Mountain. He described it is one of the most beautiful spots on the trail.  However, it was less than a mile and a half from the shelter to Big Bald mountain.  I would be there before 4 p.m. so, I was considering hiking further, to a campsite with a view another 4.7 miles beyond the mountain.  When I reached the summit of Big Bald, I took a break and took some pictures.  Then, I met and spoke with a day hiker who had come up from the south with her dog. I did not get her name. She confirmed that there was camping space further down the trail.  Then Ben and Sauce showed up, and we decided to all hike together, further south.  When we got to the view spot past Street Gap, Ben decided to keep going (27+ miles for the day for him).  Sauce set up her tent in the open field, and I set up my tarp about 100 yards further up the trail, in the woods. I was hoping the overhead cover would reduce the dew accumulation on my tarp.  I hung a bear bag line, then I took water and my food bag and joined Sauce in the field, and we talked while we made our dinners and watched the sunset. (Pictures)  Then we hung our food bags on my bear line.  Then I went to bed.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578652,"I got up at 5 a.m. broke camp, took down the bear bags Sauce and I had put up last night, & took my pack and our bags over to her tent site. After letting her know I was there so she would not be surprised, I started making breakfast and coffee. The sky started to lighten about 6:10 and what I would call sunrise began sometime after 6:30 a.m. After breakfast and coffee I watched the sunrise and took pictures. Sauce got up about 6:45, when I told her it was really getting light, as she had asked me to do. We chatted for a little while and discussed today's hiking strategies. Her intent was to stop at Jerry's Cabin shelter today, about 20 miles, and then to stop about 6 miles short of Hot Springs tomorrow. That way she would nero in Hot Springs on Friday. I told her that I would see how I felt, and what time it was, when I got to Jerry's Cabin and that if I had the energy for it I might keep hiking so that I could be in a position to do less than 20 tomorrow and reach Hot Springs tomorrow night. That way I would zero there on Friday. Of course my backup plan would be to do it the same way that she had described. The only real differences would be I would have to pay for two nights at a hostel in order to zero, & I would have a few more hours Friday morning for resupply, relaxation and rest.
While I'm thinking about it, I want to document the fact that I changed my water treatment method a few weeks ago. My friend and hiking buddy Opie had recommended this. So, when my aquamira water treatment was running low in Damascus, I started using this household bleach method instead. The hostel owner in Damascus let me take a few ounces of Clorox, which I put into my empty aquamira bottles. Filling both aquamira bottles, I can treat 4 times as much water now as with the same amount of the two-part aquamira solution. Additionally the cost of aquamarine is about $15, and I think you can buy a whole gallon of Clorox for as little as $3. The URL below has mixing and treatment instructions
http://modernsurvivalblog.com/...
That website says to use two drops of bleach per quart. I've been using 3 drops per liter. I shake it, loosen the cap and let a few drops leak out in order to clean the cap and the threads of the bottle, and then I let it sit for 30 minutes before consuming it. That is probably a lot longer then I really need to let it sit, but I just want to be safe.
Anyway, I left camp to hike south starting just before 7:15 a.m. I reached Sams Gap and the Interstate 26 crossing at about 7:45 a.m. (Picture) When I looked back at the highway from the far side, I noticed that on the bridge there was a sign saying, ""Welcome to Madison County."" So I guess it is one of the ""Bridge's of Madison County.""  Haha. (Clint Eastwood movie)
Just before 8:45 a.m. I reached the peak of the day's first climb, a place called High Rock, via a short side trail to a viewpoint. (Picture) Just before 9 o'clock, I reached the Hug Back Mountain shelter. There I ran into an interesting character. He had long grey hair tied in a ponytail, wore jeans and a light blue Patagonia puffy jacket. He had a small day pack and miscellaneous items spread out on the picnic table. I casually asked him where he was coming from and going to? His reply was, ""No place in particular"" and his tone indicated he had no desire to converse and possibly he was depressed. He did not make direct eye contact, but continued packing up his things and took a hairbrush and went behind the shelter to brush his hair. After I finished signing the logbook I left and went back to the trail. Sauce was arriving just as I was leaving, and she asked about the shelter. She at least wanted to get water, she said. I thought it prudent to tell her about the guy there and that I personally would not trust him with my backpack unattended. Sauce headed toward the shelter, & I headed south, both of us saying, ""Be safe.""
Just before 11 a.m., I reached a small fenced in area after a descent. When I looked closer, I noticed that there were two head stones: one for Joe Riddle dated May 16th, 1877 to July 9th, 1967; and the other for Dorothy Hensley, dated May 8th, 1865 to April 30th, 1965. I don't know who these people were, but he was 90, and she was over 100 years old.
I got to the Flint Mountain shelter about 12:30 p.m. There was a water source, a pipe spring, about a hundred yards prior to the shelter itself. Inside I signed the shelter logbook and sat at the picnic table for lunch. As I was finishing up, a hiker arrived and I recognized him. I had passed him earlier on the trail this morning, and saw him rinsing some clothing at a stream. I had assumed he was northbound, but now it was clear that he was southbound. We talked for awhile. His trail name was Scout, because he was an Eagle Scout and his friend from FEMA who normally hikes with him had named him that. He said he was going to the Jerry's Cabin shelter tonight and that would be 12 miles for him.  Scout also said the name of the grey-haired guy wearing jeans that I had seen at the previous shelter was Drifter and Scout said he was a nice guy.  He had some kind of work-for-stay arrangement with the Carolina Mountain Club maintainers, and he basically wandered back and forth between several shelters in this area. After some more conversation, we said farewell, & I continued south.
My next stop would be Jerry's Cabin shelter, a little over 6 and a half miles from the Flint Mountain shelter. That section of the hike starts with a long climb up a mountain called Big Butt, no kidding!  On the way up, sometime around 2:15 p.m. I passed a sign for Shelton Graves. This was a Memorial for two Union soldiers killed on the spot while visiting family members in the Confederacy during the Civil War. (Screenshot picture)
I crossed the summit of Big Butt about 3 p.m. I know it's juvenile, but in my head, I keep hearing the song lyrics, ""I like big butts...""
I reached the Jerry's Cabin shelter about 3:45 p.m. I signed the log book and took a short break. I researched hostels in Hot Springs, but I didn't have a good enough signal to call them. So I added several to my contacts so I could make some calls more easily later this afternoon. I checked the water situation for the remaining 7 miles to the Little Laurel shelter, and decided to carry two liters of water from here and get more water at my destination. I got back on the trail just after 4:00 p.m.
Shortly before 5 p.m., I saw a sign indicating that the trail splits. The white blazed AT went to the left over an exposed ridgeline. A bad weather bypass was available to the right. (Picture. I followed the white blazes.","Campsite South of Street Gap

I started getting up around 5 o'clock this morning, being as quiet as possible so as not to disturb others. I packed up, retrieved my food bag from the bear cable system, made coffee and oatmeal for breakfast. I went back to the water source just off the trail near the shelter, and filled and treated two more liters of water. According to my guide book, the only water sources south of here for the next ten miles were off the trail and unreliable. Although this sun wasn't fully up yet, I started hiking about 6:45 a.m.
I arrived at the Spring Mountain shelter just after 10 a.m., had a snack and some and signed the log book. The trail sign near the shelter indicated that this location was 282.8 miles north of Springer Mountain. My guthook app indicated it was southbound mile 1905.4.  Clearly, the math doesn't add up to this year's official length of the trail, but I was thrilled to see that not only had I reached less than 300 miles to go yesterday, I had also just passed the 1900 AT mile mark!
I did some work on my phone to coordinate activities in Hot Springs. Then, I got back on the trail just before 11 a.m. Reaching the Rich Mountain campsite at about noon, I learned from a day hiker that there was a fire tower nearby. I hiked 0.1 miles to reach it and realizing the first step was about 15 feet off the ground, I would have to climb the iron beams of the legs of the tower itself in order to ascend it. I gave this a shot, got past the first level, maybe 10 feet off the ground, but when I had no foot holds with which to climb to the next level, I found my hands and arms were too sweaty to feel comfortable continuing the climb up, so I came back down. Then I continued southbound.
About one p.m. I arrived at Tanyard Gap, and shortly after that I reached a road that passed through some fields that had been converted to a bird sanctuary and nature preserve. This was along Mill Ridge Road.  I stopped and sat in the field and ate my lunch before continuing on with hiking after 1:30 p.m.
Starting somewhere between 2:30 and 2:45, I reached the trail that enters Hot Springs from the south.  It was a long narrow ridgeline that fell off deeply on both sides. (Picture) To the left I could see and hear the town of Hot Springs below and the river running north into the same valley between the mountains in which the town was nestled. As the trail started to descend, there were a number of spots from which there were clear views through the trees of the city and the river. (Picture) Where the trail circled from the right side around the northern end and onto the left side of a steep ridgeline heading back southward was a view points called Lovers Leap Rock. (Picture) As the trail continued to descend, there were more stunning viewpoints, some literally breathtaking. (Pictures) Eventually as it neared the level of the water in the river, the trail switched back to the north again and continued into town.
Around 3:15 p.m. I reached the outskirts of town, & I saw a couple of signs referring to a presumably defunct silver mine. I continued walking and crossed a large bridge from east to west into downtown Hot Springs. After crossing the bridge, the Hot Springs Resort and Spa was directly on the right. The resort also included a campground, open all year said the sign.
I walked through town, stopping briefly at the Welcome Center, and arrived at the Laughing Heart Hostel about 3:45.  Showered, did laundry, dinner with Rock Spider, whom I met in Erwin (he's from Israel, and is taking Yom Kippur off).","Little Laurel Shelter

I discussed strategy for the hike through the Smokies with Rock Spider and the others. We decided to carry four days worth of food leaving here and shuttle to resupply in Gatlinburg rather than two and resupply at the Standing Bear hostel (which has gotten really bad reviews).  This also would lighten our loads, on average in the Smokies.  Consequently, I needed to go back to the store for some more supplies.   I had lunch at a restaurant in town with Rock Spider and Pickles, and then we went to the Outfitters, where I got the items I needed.
In town, I saw an historical marker indicating that the town was named ""Warm Springs"" until 1886, when a warmer spring was discovered. That was during the era of 1800s grand hotels serviced by railroad lines.  The rail is still here, but there are no passenger cars on the trails that come through anymore.  The sign explained that during WWII, the crews of German merchant ships were captured and this town was an internment camp. In fact, the camp itself was on what is now the grounds of the resort.  Owners of several of the town's homes also rented rooms to these German ""guests"".

I actually got on the trail about 10 after 8 a.m.  Hoops was carrying backpacks in her car, so I was able to hike with a small pack and minimum load (slack pack).  Our ""group"" also consisted of Rock Spider, Sauce and Pickles. 
Around 9:15 a.m., I reached the Deer Park Mountain shelter, and around 10:20 Garenflo Gap. There began the second large climb for the day, from 2400 feet to 4800 feet. The initial 3 miles out of Hot Springs had been uphill as well, from 1400 feet to 2600 feet.
I arrived at the Walnut Mountain shelter at about 12:15 p.m. Finding no logbook, I stopped to have lunch.
Rock Spider and I reached the Roaring Fork shelter about 2:30 p.m. and took our time having a snack.  Hoops was to meet us at Max Patch at 5, so we did not want to rush into being too early.  It was getting chilly though, so we decided to hike to the open grassy mountain-top hoping that would be sunnier and therefore warmer.  We got to the top about 3:45 p.m.  Sauce and Pickles arrived about 4:30.  There were dozens of small groups of day hikers on top, too. So, we picked out a flat area to claim as our camp site. Then we hiked 0.5 mi off trail to a parking lot where we had arranged to meet Hoops. 
Hoops got there about 5:15 p.m., and we switched gear to our larger back packs. Then we divided up the additional ""supplies"" that Hoops had transported for all of us.  That included pizza for dinner, oreo cookies, pretzels, water, donuts for breakfast and some beer in a cooler with ice.  I got the cooler, and carrying it back up the steep 0.5 mi hill really felt like it made up for the easy hike we had had all day long.  We were joined by mid-20s hiker ""Sniffles,"" who had previously been hiking with Pickles. He was also on the sobo part of his flip flop, and had started at Harper's Ferry in mid May.
We set up a small tent city and gathered to enjoy the dinner food. Then we got set to watch the sunset.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578932,"I got up this morning at 6 a.m. It had been a windy night and I'd gotten up around 1 a.m. and reconfigured my tarp because the wind caused all of its sides to flap loudly. I lowered the apex of the front to the minimum height of my trekking poles, and brought the tarp down to the ground all around, also widening the ground surface area covered at the same time. On inside I stood my other trekking pole at its minimum height, around the point where the natural center of the 13 foot length of the tarp would be. This created room for me to sleep on my air mattress in my sleeping bag under the center line. After that it was much quieter and I slept fairly well.
So when I got up around 6 a.m., the first thing I did was elevate the open end of the tarp to the normal height of my pole. This gave me room to sit, gather my things and start packing. Then when the sun began to lighten the sky, I took my air mattress and sleeping bag and joined the others like we had the night before, but this time to watch the sun come up.
The sunrise was beautiful. It was cold, and the wind made it seem even colder. So the sleeping bags were necessary for us to be comfortable while sitting still. (Pictures)
Afterwards, we finished packing up. Sauce, Rock Spider, Pickles, and Sniffles all said goodbye and thank you to Hoops and headed south on the trail. I realized I had left my hiking wallet in the small pack I had worn yesterday. I had placed it in a zipper pocket inside another pocket just to be sure I wouldn't lose it. However, now it was down the hill in a parking lot in Hoops' car. So, after we were all completely packed up, I helped Hoops carry the trash and leftovers from our dinner and breakfast down to her car and I retrieved my wallet. After saying goodbye and thank you to her, I returned to the trail and started making my way south to catch up with the others. They had left the top around 8:30 a.m., and I was been leaving around 9 a.m.
I had been wearing all my warm clothing, including my goretex, while we were watching the sunrise, but less was needed now. Keeping the long sleeved blue shirt on, I switched to the light windbreaker. However, after I started hiking south about a half mile down the trail, even that was too much, so ended up in my short sleeved shirt.
Around 11 a.m. I  reached the side trail for the Groundhog Creek shelter. Rock Spider was taking a break there, & I saw a backpack I recognized as that belonging to Sauce just off to the side of the side trail. She had evidently gone down to the shelter. I talked to Rock Spider for a few minutes. He said that he was not feeling well, and might need to stop at the the upcoming Standing Bear hostel.  After a few more minutes of conversation, I continued on and arrived at the Snowbird Peak around noon. Pickles and Sniffles were there taking a break. The clearing on the peak had some nice views of the Smoky Mountains to the southwest. This is a preview of where we would be hiking tomorrow after entering the park from the north this afternoon. (Pictures) I stopped for a break and soon Sauce and then Rock Spider showed up.  We all sat around and had a snack, and then continued hiking about 12:30 p.m. Shortly after word, we passed a strange looking building with a conical white object mounted on top of it. (Picture) The trail would be downhill 4.5 miles to the Standing Bear hostel.  We had all indicated that we intended to stop there briefly before continuing to the Davenport Gap entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the Davenport Gap shelter which would be our destination for the day.
Rock Spider and I caught up with the others and arrived at the Standing Bear Hostel at around 2:30 p.m. We all stayed there long enough for resupply, a little rest and some battery charging. We left there about 4:30 p.m., enroute to Davenport Gap shelter, arriving at the crossing of Interstate 40 at about 4:45 p.m. (Picture)
I hiked up the hill to Davenport Gap and into the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, causing to deposit my permit at the entry kiosk. A little less than a mile later, around 6 p.m. I arrived at the Davenport Gap shelter. The others arrived shortly afterward. There was another section hiker already there: Tom from Washington DC, a Department of Labor employee. However, we didn't have any crowding problems as it is reportedly common to have in the Smokies.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579020,"I got up at just after 6:30 a.m. this morning at the Davenport Gap shelter just inside the northern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park or GSM NP. Normal morning routine of packing, breakfast, chatter, water, hygiene. On the trail just before 8 a.m. Today's hike to the Peck's Corner shelter would start with a climb from 2800 feet to 5200 feet. Most of what we would hike over the next few days would be above 5000 feet, but you have to get up there first. When I had stopped at the Standing Bear Hostel yesterday, Twisted had said the first 6 miles would be up a stone staircase, torture. Anyway, off I set to start that climb.
About 9:30 I reached a nice viewpoint and took a panoramic picture. Sniffles and Sauce were already there. I had passed Rock Spider and Pickles on the way up, as well as the section hiker named Tom. After hanging out at the viewpoint for a few minutes, I continued up the trail. At one point, I left my pack and took a .6 miles side trail to the Mount Cammerer observation tower, where I took some pictures and videos of the countryside. I returned to the trail by jogging, since I had brought only my poles, camera, and wallet with me. Then I put my backpack on and continued south.
Just after 11 a.m., I reached the Cosby Knob shelter which was closed due to aggressive bear activity. Therefore, I just kept going. Coming the other direction around 11:15 a.m., I saw section hikers Bambi and Roadrunner, whom I had met the morning I left the Laughing Heart Hostel. We stopped and chatted for a few minutes, wished each other good and safe hiking, and continued. The trail went along a narrow ridgeline for a little less than a mile. It was a beautiful, cool, sunny day. I could see between the trees on both sides of the narrow ridge, and the sky was perfectly blue. (Picture)
Around 11:30 a.m., the trail went back down a few hundred feet. But then I began the second long line of the day, from 4800 feet to 6300 feet. As I reached higher elevation, I noticed a change in the forest from mostly deciduous trees, dominated by the rhododendron to short leafed fir trees. The latter was often covered with a light green fungus and light green Spanish moss. (Picture) I could often smell the mixed scents of the pine from the fir, the pungent decay of laurel leaves, and the warm odor of moss and grass.
I had been planning to stop at the top of that climb for lunch, but at about 1:15 p.m. I reached a clearing that was marked in my guide as an old helipad. Sniffles was there taking a break, & I decided to just stop there for lunch. While I was eating, Sauce and Pickles caught up, and they began their lunch breaks too. I got back on the trail after 1:30 p.m. I kept walking up and down on relatively smooth trail, mostly up. Around 4 o'clock most of us wound up together at another break, and we decided to stop at one of the upcoming views to have dinner. This would give us an opportunity to walk a little bit after eating, and it would reduce the odor of food in the vicinity of the shoulder where we would stay, consequently reducing the probability of an encounter with bears. Around 5:30 we stopped and used some cut tree trunks as benches near a viewpoint from which we could see beautiful surrounding mountainside to the north. (Pictures) This is where we cooked dinner. Or I should say all except Rock Spider who arrived a little later than the others and decided to keep walking and have his dinner at the shelter.
After dinner I continued walking to the shelter and set up there as usual. There was one other section hiker there at the time, his name was Larry. Before we knew i,t it was starting to get dark, and Larry went to bed. As I filled another liter water from the local water source, I could hear the sound of a bunch of other hikers arriving. I was tired so I went to bed before they fully arrived. Then I heard another group arrive even later. Noisy.
They also used white lights and talked loudly until about 10 p.m. when they crammed 6 more people into the remaining shelter space, so it was a pretty tight fit for them. At one point I think one of them was trying to get a settled hiker to move over so they could fit yet another person on the bottom bunk. That didn't go over well.
After that they didn't bother us too much and I was able to sleep. In the middle of the night, though I was awakened several times by the sound of an elephant. That was actually one of the late arriving hikers snoring extremely loudly. I tried to ignore it and went back to sleep.

I'm not sure about the other group.
I got on the trail somewhere between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. and around 8 a.m. I arrived at a nice viewpoint with visibility to the southwest. You could see the shadow of mountains from the east on the mountains to the west. (Picture)
Charlie's Bunyan around 10 a.m. Lots of pictures.
New Found Gap, the road to Gatlinburg, around noon. Stopped for lunch. Rock Spider caught up and said he would be meeting a friend and was going into Gatlinburg. We took a picture with him.
Mount Collins around 3 p.m. - this was a wooded mountaintop, so there were no views.
Clingman's Dome just after 4 p.m. the tower was under construction, so I couldn't go up. I took some pictures of the work that was on going. Walked 0.5 mi down to the visitors' center for water and snacks.  Back on the AT south about 5:30 p.m.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579109,"I was up at 6 a.m. because some of the other hikers in the shelter we're getting up and nature was calling. Last night I noticed a blister on the end of my toe, so this morning I took a few moments before other activities to perform a minor surgery on it, relieving the pain and pressure, and putting some neosporin ointment on it along with some super tape to provide additional protection. When Sniffles, Pickles, and Sauce got up at about 6:30, I finished changing and went about my normal routine.
I had oatmeal and coffee with carnation essentials for breakfast, what has become my usual over the last couple weeks. I got on the trail about 7:30 a.m. First up this morning was Siler's Bald. This was a short climb, and about a half mile into it there was a nice view to the southeast, with the sun rising on the left casting shadows on mountains on the right, and a sea of clouds nestled  between the peaks of a myriad of mountain tops. (Pictures)
I reached the top of Sellers Bald which actually was not bald but wooded, and then I reached the Tylersville shelter on the other side of the peak around 8:15 a.m. I stopped and talked to to other hikers for a while. A few days ago I had noticed that by pure coincidence, some of my clothing was actually sort of color matched. The orange stripe in my under Armour running pants kind of matched the orange of my lightweight Patagonia windbreaker, and they kind of matched the reddish orange color of the top section of my trekking  poles.  Since this was what I had on this morning, I asked Sauce to take a picture of me in it. (Pictures)
I was back on the trail about 8:30 a.m., and I reached the top of Miry Ridge between 9:15 and 9:30. Derek's Knob shelter at about 10:30 a.m. stopped there for a snack break, and I filled up 2 liters of water. I helped Sauce make a 2000 mile milestone marker out of small Stones. (Picture) Back on the trail about 11 a.m. past Sugar Tree Gap around 11:15. Of course, a gap is a low point between higher elevations. However, I noted that the sign indicated the elevation was 4435 feet. At Starkey Gap around 11:45 a.m. It was a steep climb from there to the top of Thunder Head Mountain and then Rocky Top. The latter being the place which the University of Tennessee fight song is about. I reached there and stopped for lunch about 12:45 p.m. I stayed there for about an hour and had lunch. Pickles and Sauce were right behind me. Sniffles came about a half an hour later. He had been having difficulty with his water filter running slowly. I got back on the trail shortly before 2 p.m. Devils Tater Patch at about 5:20 p.m.  Mollies Ridge shelter about 5:30 p.m.  Set up tarp because there were already about 8 people in the shelter.  Dinner.

Normal morning routine, but it is staying dark earlier, so I started hiking in the dark just prior to 7 a.m. I stopped for a break at Brown Fork Gap shelter shortly after 9. This has been hard uphill climbing and I had a long way to go today. It was cool. The sky was great, and the air was filled with humidity. All around the ridge tops on which we climbed, we could see valleys full of coffee cutting like White Cloud. I thought the effects of Hurricane Nate were beginning to show up in this area. However, sources were telling me by email that it would hit the coast of Alabama tonight around 1 a.m., and pass through Atlanta tomorrow afternoon about 1 p.m. So the full effect would not be felt in this area for another day and a half. Local forecasts were fairly decent for the rest of today, but it looked like it would rain all week starting tomorrow.
Took a break at the Brown Fork Gap shelter and had lunch at Cheoah Bald mountain top after a hard climb.  Nice view, just under the ceiling of clouds. It had rained here only hours earlier.  Then one last hard climb and then down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. (Pictures)

He pointed out a paper Kroger grocery bag with trail magic in it -- all expired, some items with July 2016 dates. He would not eat any of it. I ate six oreo cookies, and a bunch of other items, and when Sauce and Pickles joined us, I split a pack of mini Keebler chocolate cookies and a pack of mini Oreos with them. None of us got sick.
Last night after dinner, I went back to the hostel room which was maybe 8' x 12' with 2 bunkbeds. I got a top bunk and slept fairly well. Spent the morning at the NOC: breakfast, supplies for one day, picked up laundry started yesterday, packed. I got my trekking poles fixed at the outfitters, then had lunch. 
After lunch, we took our time getting our hike started. It had rained all day due to Hurricane Nate and the forecast continued to show predicted rain all night and through tomorrow... anyway, we got under way around 1 p.m.  
We took a break at the Wesser Bald shelter, about 6 miles from the NOC, and as soon as we were under its roof, it really started raining with a vengeance. As we got ready to continue our hike, the rain let up a bit, and although we did have a lot of cold wind and a good amount of rain, it could have been a lot worse. We got to the Cold Spring shelter just after 6 p.m., and I think we hiked the last 2 miles in about a half hour (fast!). There was a section hiker, Dennis, and his dog already there. Dennis was very surprised to see four other hikers show up at the shelter that he thought he would have all to himself, but he kindly made room for us, and we enjoyed the fire he already had started.

Stopped at Wayah Bald for a break. There was a stone tower there. In the pictures in my guide, it had an enclosed top with a roof, but that is now gone.  It was still pretty foggy and cloudy when we got there, eerie. (Pictures)
Arrived at the road to Franklin about 3:15 p.m. Got a hitch to town from a nice couple with a pickup.  Tried the Gooder Grove hostel first, but it just didn't feel right there so we moved on to the Budget Inn.  I shared a room with Sniffles; Sauce with Pickles. Shower. Laundry.
We did a little resupply at the Outdoor 76 Outfitter, then had our first dinner of the evening at the Lazy Hiker Brewery (quesadilla and a flight of their brews).

Then I broke down the packaging from supplies I purchased yesterday and reloaded my food bag. After that I repacked my clean clothes and got dressed for the day, and by that time it was about 7:30 a.m.
I went to breakfast at a place called the Kountry Kitchen, and I sat and drank coffee while I waited for the others. Sniffles, Sauce, and Pickles arrived at different times over the next 30 minutes. We had a big breakfast, and then walked back to the Budget Inn. During breakfast we talked about the fact that today we would cross mile 2089.8, and at that point we would have less than 100 miles to go. Double digits. We also discussed the fact that tomorrow we would cross mile 2100, and we would enter the state of Georgia. We got a shuttle ride back out to the trailhead, and we were on the trail again at 11:15 a.m.
It started raining lightly at about 12:15, as I was crossing Wallace gap. That didn't last long though, and although the forest was damp and the rocks were wet and slippery, it was a very nice day for hiking.

On the trail sometime before 8 a.m. Most of the fog had cleared off during the night, but it was still grey in the morning. The ground was damp and the forest quiet. It was raining lightly, almost a mist, with occasional drops.
There was no shortage of water today. I crossed a number of streams, some of which would have been dry a few days ago, and I saw some others that were significantly swollen. (Pictures)
I stopped at the Muskrat Creek shelter for lunch about 12:30 p.m. Met through hiker ""Handy"" there. He was a 46 year old bearded man who had begun a flip flop in Vermont in May, after hiking south on the Long Trail from the Canadian border. He had also spent 4 months last winter working at the Stratton Motel in Maine (a place I stayed) after he had hiked the portion of the Appalachian Trail between Vermont and Katahdin. He said that when he finished the AT, he intended to go work at the Angels Rest hostel, in Pearisburg Virginia, another place I stayed. 
After lunch, I got back on the trail about 1:30 p.m.  At some point the rain had stopped and it got sunny and hot, and the trail got dry. I also started to get pretty thirsty.  I passed thru the Plumorchard shelter about 4 p.m., and I decided to push on.  I texted my hiking friends Sauce, Pickles, and Sniffles to let them know. I was disappointed there was no pen with which to write in the log book. I filled a liter of water from an excellent water source near the shelter and hiked to a tent site about four miles further.  23.9 miles for the day.  
I tried to see where the others would stop for the day, but I had no signal at the tent site. I was solo again. We all hike our own hike, and sometimes we are in sync and sometimes we get out of sync. I had only been with them for about a week, but I really enjoyed their company. With the finish so close, I'm starting to feel ready to get home. That said, the remaining trail is only so big, and it is possible I will get to see them again and have a more graceful goodbye.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579419,"I got up at my campsite at about 5:30. The whole place was shrouded in clouds and I could see mist floating in front of my headlamp. It was raining lightly, but I broke camp and ate breakfast. After reviewing my plan for the next couple of days, I got underway on the trail shortly after 7:15 a.m.  Reached Powell Mountain about 8:30 a.m., and just before 9 a.m., reached the intersection with the side trail to the Deep Gap shelter. According to the guide, the shelter was 0.3 miles off the trail. That felt like too much of a diversion for a snack break, so I kept going.
Shortly after 9 a.m., it stopped raining and got sunny. Cool, but sunny. And the trail began to dry off again. About 9:15 a.m. I arrived at the top of Kelly Knob, the last peak over 4,000 ft in Georgia. There was a nice view to the northeast, and I could see where I had been yesterday - mountain peaks and ridgelines with intervening valleys blanketed with fluffy white clouds. I stopped for a quick water break. (Picture) Then I continued south.
About 9:30 a.m. or so, as I descended the southern side of Kelly Knob, I walked into what was undoubtedly the white blanket described above. Conditions reverted to what I had experienced when I got up. Wet trail. Fog. Light rain. Once I passed the Addis Gap area and started climbing again, the clouds had mostly cleared up. It was sunny and cool again, but the trail was damp and only beginning to dry off.
I arrived at the side trail to the Tray Mountain shelter right about 11:30 a.m. and decided to stop for lunch and replenish my water supply. There were also some very nice views along this path. (Picture) After lunch, I was back on the trail at 12:15 p.m. going up and down a couple of times, I eventually reached and crossed Georgia Route 75 at Unicoi Gap at about 2:30 p.m. On the way down I had met several section hikers, including Ned, a policeman, wearing an orange football jersey labeled ""Coach"" and a large external frame backpack that he acknowledged was too heavy but said was very comfortable. Ned was getting water further downstream, from a source at which I topped off. We talked for a few minutes, about hiking in general and about conditions on the trail in both directions in particular, and then we wished each other a good hike and continued on in our respective directions.
I reached the Blue Mountain shelter about 3:45 p.m. On both sides of Blue Mountain, south of Unicoi Gap I saw an incredible number of blown down trees. Very big ones. I was impressed by how much maintenance had already been done, since there was indication that this was fresh trailhead clearing work, and it had occurred since Hurricane Irma created this mess. I felt the timing of my arrival in this section of the trail was fortunate. On the way down the south side of Blue Mountain, I met someone who I first thought was a day hiker with a small dog off leash. This turned out to be a trail maintainer who has had responsibility for the section a few miles north of Spring Mountain for sometime and who just recently picked up responsibility for the section I was hiking south of Unicoi Gap. We talked a while, and then I continued hiking. I heard what sounded like rifle fire, and wondered if it was associated with units training around Camp Merrill, near Dahlonega, Georgia. My brother had talked about the mountain phase of the Army Ranger course that he had attended there years ago.
I passed a couple sets of short-section hikers in my last couple of miles today, and we exchanged information about the trail ahead in each direction. I arrived at the Poplar Stamp Gap tent site at about 5:45 p.m., and I decided to go on to the Low Gap shelter, about two miles further. I knew I could get water between Poplar Stamp and a shelter, but I didn't know if there would be any cell phone reception there.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579451,"Just to finish up from last night's journal entry, I stopped and filled all my water bottles about .3 miles prior to the Low Gap shelter and then stopped there for the night. There was a section hiker named Dan already there.  He was a 50 year old from near Atlanta, Georgia; although he had grown up in the Schenectady, New York area until he was about 13. He said that he would be traveling to Unicoi Gap over the course of the next two days. After chatting for a little while with Dan, I had a normal evening dinner routine. Then another section hiker, also named Dan, arrived. He was a 64 year old from near Atlanta, and he said that he had been a musician as well as a nationally ranked bicycle racer. After several years of racing himself, he spent a few years training other racers. As a guitar player, he had toured with some big bands; and then after getting married and having children, he found a way to stay and play only in the Atlanta area, mostly wedding gigs. The first Dan had hiked in a couple pounds of what he called ""fat wood"", which were sticks coated with some kind of resin to make them burn easier. He had prepared a fire. So after dinner the three of us sat for a while, continued to chat, and enjoyed the fire. Both Dans were about to finish their hiking in a couple days and said they were carrying too much food, so they gave me a bunch of their excess. I went to bed maybe a little after 8 p.m.
I slept in this morning until around 7 a.m., tired from yesterday's long hike. I completed a normal morning routine, said farewell to the two Dans, and then I hiked back up to the trail. I returned to the excellent water source I had used last night and filled another liter of water there. Then I sat for a while, taking a phone break to do this journaling, and examined my plan for the next few days once again. I realized that today I would need to make a decision about when to summit Springer Mountain and when I would be able to complete the approach trail down to Amicalola Falls. After doing this, I would need to communicate that information to my old Army friend Bill G., who had said he would come pick me up and that I could spend a couple days recuperating at his home in Alpharetta, Georgia.
As I started the day, it was misty, damp and cold. The forest was blanketed in fog, as it had been the previous two mornings. It was also Friday the 13th. Spooky.
During another break around 10 a.m., Vanilla Thunder (Stewart) passed by.  I had not seen him since he left Hot Springs a day before me, to bike with his son, Seth, who had completed a through hike two years ago. We talked for a little while. Only a few minutes later, Sauce and Pickles showed up! We all took a break, chatted and I'm happy we had the opportunity to say proper farewells and congratulations for near completion of the trail. I asked Sauce and Pickles to relay the same sentiments to Sniffles. 
I then hiked south and caught up with Vanilla Thunder around noon, as he was finishing his lunch. I decided to try to slow down and enjoy my last few days on the trail a bit more, so I asked Stewart if I could join him for the final part. He agreed and we discussed strategy (summit Sunday afternoon, etc).  Hiking up and down we caught some nice views (picture).  Reaching Hog Pen Gap around 1 p.m., we stopped there for water. Then another up and down, and we reached Tenastee Gap about 1:45 p.m. before heading back up another hill.  After a couple more peaks and gaps, we reached Neels Gap and stopped there for the day. I took a picture of the famous tree in which a lot of northbound hikers have thrown their uncomfortable footwear after completing the distance of about 30 miles from their official start point (My endpoint).
From the store there I got the minimum additional resupply required for the remaining distance of about 30 miles to Springer Mountain followed by the 8 mile approach trail to Amicalola State Park Visitor's Center. I also got a shower, frozen pizza for dinner and a bunk in the hostel for the night. Stewart did the same. His knee was hurting and he was concerned about weight loss, having weighed himself recently and been about 138 pounds compared to his norm of closer to 160.
I charged my phone and battery and texted Bill G., who I learned was in Florida. We coordinated a tentative plan in which I would summit Springer on Sunday afternoon (with Stewart), camp Sunday night on the approach trail and then we would link up on Monday morning at Amicalola. 
I felt physically strong but mentally and emotionally drained.

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579495,"I woke up sometime after 6 a.m. at the hostel at Neels Gap. Stewart and I took our time going about packing and breakfast. There were about 10 other people at the hostel last night. This included three ladies in their sixties who referred to themselves as the Three Grandmas. They decided to tent outside where it was nice and cool rather than sleep in the muggy bunk room. There were also several young people in their 30's from Florida, and they were doing a short section hike from Springer to North Carolina. The latter group got up about the same time as Stewart and I, and we chatted during breakfast. 
After it got light, about 7:30, Stewart and I hiked across the road and started up Blood Mountain. There is a story about the mountain on the plaque visible in one of the pictures of Neels Gap that I took yesterday. I zoomed in to read it and learned that the mountain was one of the places featured in Cherokee mythology. It was home to the Numni, the immortal people. This reminded me of the legend I related last week regarding the warning given to Union soldiers about a town in southern North Carolina. According to that story Union forces bypassed that town and burned everything else between there and Atlanta. In that Legend the Cherokee had alerted the Union soldiers about the Numni and they steered clear. Anyway, there were some great views near and at the top of Blood Mountain. (Pictures) I could see for miles and felt like a small creature in a big world.
Yesterday afternoon, I had received a message from my cousin Jodi B., saying my Uncle Bruno (age 97) was lucid and recognized the name from the Mount Greylock 10th Mountain Division ski trip plaque that I had sent her back in the Spring, and he was telling stories about it. My Uncle Bruno was assigned to the Fort Drum, NY unit during WWII. She recommended that I give him a call, so I did that this morning, just before 9 a.m. I had a great conversation with him. He spoke very highly and fondly of Rudy Konieczny.  Said they were in the same company, that Konieczny was a ""fireball,"" always carried a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle), and when they found him in northern Italy, he was surrounded by the bodies of about ten Germans.  It was F Company, some part of 87th Infantry, 10th Mountain Division (Ski Troop).  We also talked about hiking in Arizona. Uncle Bruno promised to look for and send me maps and information from his records regarding his hikes in Arizona. He spoke with some passion about hiking in the Superstition Mountain Wilderness Area in particular, and he described significant disappointment in his Arizona senator who had apparently hidden earmarked legislation in some obscure bill, selling off parts of that for development. He said the bill promised a 2 for 1 acre exchange that as far as he knew had never materialized. I told him that someday I hoped to hike there and along the Arizona Trail. He also congratulated me on retirement from the US Army.
About 9:15 a.m., I started down the south side of Blood Mountain, after Stewart. While on the descent, I contacted the Amicalola Falls State Park Visitors' Center and then the lodge by Amicalola Falls itself, and made a reservation for tomorrow night. The room charge is a little pricey there, but I feel like that environment will be more conducive to quiet personal celebration than another night in a tent after I've completed the trail.
Passing through Girard Gap about 10:30 a.m., Stewart and I were maintaining a nice and steady 2 mile per hour pace. About 30% slower and easier than a had been hiking for the last month. Conditions this morning at Neels Gap were about identical to the previous two mornings with the top of Blood Mountain being sunny above the white blanket as higher points in last two mornings had been. Now south of the mountain, I was once again under and inside the fog and cloud, and the trail was damp and cool. However, this was perfect hiking weather from a physical comfort perspective, and I knew that this afternoon would likely be hot and humid as it had been the previous two afternoons.
About 11:45 a.m., just south of the Dockery Lake Trail, Stewart and I passed 2 adults and 2 children who were stopped for a break off the side of the trail. I waved as we were going by. Then the man and his wife recognized me as GI Joe and reminded me that we had met twice previously- just north of and then again in Daleville, Virginia. They had been section hiking, but had to get off the trail in order to go home to prepare for hurricane Irma.  He was Papa Bear and she was Puffs. This time they were doing a section of Georgia with their two nieces. The two girls, probably around 9 and 11, were seated in small camp chairs, and they looked tired but also like they were enjoying being in the forest. As I thought back on it, I realized that would have been the third and 4th of September. It was also the day before Wesley, i.e. Mr Lippy, and I had met Stewart for the first time, on Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob. Small world out here on the AT.
About 12:30 p.m., we stopped at Big Cedar Ledges for lunch. Very nice views. (Pictures) At about 1:30 we reached Woody Gap where I was able to dispose of some trash before we moved on. There were a lot of cars in the parking lot which corresponded to the number hikers we had seen on the trail today. At least a hundred maybe two.
We arrived at our planned destination for the day, the Gooch Mountain shelter, just after 4 p.m. I filled my water bottles and we sat, took a break and discussed whether we should continue or stop for the day. We decided to continue and do another 3 miles or so. We would camp at the Cooper Gap area. That would leave us a little more than 12 miles to complete tomorrow in order to get to the summit of Springer Mountain. In my case, I would need to add about 8 miles onto that after summiting, in order to reach the Amicalola Falls Lodge. So, around 4:15 p.m., we headed south again.
Sometime after 5:30 pm we arrived at Cooper Gap, 12.3 miles north of Springer Mountain. We picked out a campsite just south of the two roads which crossed at the intersection with the trail. I set up my tarp, hung a bear bear bag line and then made dinner. Stewart and I chatted as we ate. After dinner we hung our food on the bear bag line for the last time on this journey, and at about 7:30 p.m., it started getting dark. Bedtime.","Neels Gap Hostel

We arrived at the Hawk Mountain shelter sometime around 9 ish. I signed the logbook and talked with day and section hikers. One of them said there had been about 50 people camped there last night - busy weekend! We continued south and reached a short side trail to Long Creek Falls shortly before 11 a.m., stopping there to get water and take pictures.
Around 11:30 I met fellow southbound through hiker Piper. Shortly afterwards a through hiker who finished in August named Wood Pile met us at the 3 Forks Road crossing and gave the three of us trail beer and chips as trail magic.
Stopped at the Stover Creek shelter at about 12:30 p.m. (Picture) Ate lunch, effectively emptying my food bag. I signed the log book, and noticed that another hiker who had signed earlier today ended their entry with the phrase, ""On to life's next white blaze"" which I found poetic, so I made this note to remember it.
About 1:30 p.m., we reached the Forest Service Road parking lot north of Spirit Mountain, and with only 0.9 miles to go began the final segments of the climb to the top of Springer Mountain. On the way up we met hiker Handy, who I had met briefly several days ago, and we chatted with him for awhile before continuing. We reached the top at about 2:15 p.m., took several photographs, and signed the trail register log book. We then said our farewells, and some time after 2:30 p.m., I continued down the approach trail to the south while Stewart and Piper went back to the parking lot where Stewart would be picked up by his wife and Piper by his mother.
I felt too much to process  both joy regarding successful conclusion of one of the most amazing experiences of my life and simultaneously a very deep sadness about the conclusion of one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I tried to think about the list of things I would want to do when I get home. I tried, but I found myself just drifting down the trail in front of me. It had become a grey afternoon. I was absolutely alone for quite some time. It began raining. There were no sounds except for those made by my feet and the raindrops on the trees. Then from about 3 to 3:30 I saw a whole bunch of guys, all in their 30s or 40s and all with the ""look"" of ex-military.  Then it got quiet on the trail again.
I arrived at the lodge at Amicalola State Park about 5 p.m. After checking in, I jogged down to the falls so I could photograph the 700 foot waterfall before it got dark. My next priorities were clean clothes and a shower. There was no laundry facility, so I bought a t-shirt From the gift shop, and after my shower, I put on the new shirt and my running pants. Then I went to the buffet dinner in the lodge. I also took a bunch of pictures of the beautiful sunset.
After dinner, with my AT hike complete, I sat on the lodge's balcony and relaxed while watching the sun continue to set, just getting more and more beautiful, until it got dark.","Tent Site Near Cooper Gap

GI Joe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579625,"I got up at 7 a.m. and for breakfast ate some of the leftover pizza I had ordered after dinner last night. I also had a couple cups of coffee, a shower, packed up all my stuff into my backpack and checked out. I decided that instead of getting picked up at the lodge, I wanted to hike the remainder of the approach trail down to the Visitors' Center. When I checked out at the front desk, the lodge manager informed me that a portion of that trail was still impassable because of blown down trees damaged during Hurricane Irma. He showed me the rerouted portion on a park trail map. Essentially, the upper half of the large staircase running 1 mile from the top of the falls to the bottom of the mountain was bypassed using the access road. I would still get to complete the trip to the Visitors' Center at the stone archway that serves as a sort of psychological if not the official start point for most northbound hikers. 
This morning it was windy and significantly colder than yesterday. I had heard this change predicted in weather forecast describing the weather system that had passed through late yesterday, bringing rain and the clouds responsible for yesterday's sunset. 
First, I made my way down a portion of the access road, and then went across the parking lot and through the woods on a confusing series of trails marked with yellow and green blazes. The black and white photocopy of the park map given to me at the lodge was not much help here. Haha. Just before 9 a.m., I arrived at a reflecting pool at the bottom of the falls. I took a couple pictures. I think this was the spot at which I had seen a white automobile parked in the distance in yesterday's photograph from the top of the falls. I took a look around and located the continuation of the approach trail which I used from there as the path to the Visitors' Center.
This trail maintained a relatively shallow slope and ran roughly adjacent to the runoff stream from the falls. It passed a number of picnic areas, pavilions, and cabins. At the top of the falls I had seen a sign and yellow caution tape closing off the top portion of the approach trail. Next to it was another sign which described that part of the approach trail as ""difficulty -- strenuous. 425 steps.""  Apparently all 425 of those steps were on the upper half mile of the approach trail between the reflecting pool at the bottom and the top of the falls.
I arrived at the bottom of the approach trail at about 9:15 a.m. and took a few pictures at the stone archway. I then went into the Visitors' Center.  I signed the logbook there, and the staff gave me a complimentary Cherry Coke and ice cream sandwich. I looked around the VC for a while, and Bill picked me up around 10 a.m.

As I'm now at the end of this ""expedition,"" I want to express my deep appreciation for all of the people who are and have been part of it. It has been a journey full of adventures and wonderful experiences made far more enjoyable with the inspiring company and support of great people, friends and loved ones with whom I have had the fortune to share it. I can hope for nothing more important in any part of the continuing journey that is my life. 
“The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun... Happiness only real when shared.” -- Alexander Supertramp/Christopher McCandless
In particular, I am especially glad to have met and bonded with many fellow hikers -- May you stay forever young! Also, special thanks to my wife Teresa, for both all the time needed to complete this and for the near-daily tedium of editing my misspelled journal entries. I love you.","The Lodge at Amicalola State Park
