Pilgrim Billbones,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567044,"(For future reference, my cell phone acted up, got wet and had battery issues, so no pics for 1st week or 2. There will be lots of pics, in later entries after about 7 or 8 May, as I bought a small water-proof camera at Nantahala Outdoor Center).

Several of the group members stayed in a hotel in Dahlonega Ga the night of the 28th. Went into town to a restaurant that eve. for dinner with some group members.
Dahlonega is a pretty mountain town, very touristy with shops and 2nd level porches on buildings for cafes etc. University of North Georgia is there.
Group ( 7 of us: Age 67 female Charli,  66 male Rennie, 60 female Terri, 59 male Bill, 55 male Scott, 40 female Arlene, 38 female Lizzy ).  had 1st meeting at Mt. Pleasant Church parking lot in the country, headed up (drove) to Springer Mountain  (6 miles up a forest service rd.) to start hiking at 3 pm, Warren advised us to take our time and enjoy since this would be a low miles day, 7.2 ,  .  I passed a modest sized waterfall, Long Falls, and almost walked by when I impulsively decided to christen myself  (christen with a small c ) .
I took only my shoes and socks off and walked out in shallow water still wearing long pants and shirt, & sat (braced myself) under one side of the waterfall. The water at that level was moderate to heavy flow about 10 feet high. Air temp was in low 70's, the water was much colder, but not bone-chilling icy. I could only sit hunched over for a couple of minutes as the water was pounding my body down.
I felt pretty good after , but then was stuck with what to do with wet clothes, with no time to dry them the next day. Had to put them up in a bin wet for several days as there was next to zero free time after the next few hiking days for things like drying clothes.
We camped under a secluded pavillion with a roof at Hickory Flats. Nice old cemetary directly behind us. Felt like a country church. It stormed that night, happy we had a roof.","Springer Mountain Georgia

Pilgrim Billbones,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567046,"Wildlife surprise already!  Started up the trail about 6:45 am. Was walking about 150 feet ahead of Arlene.
I had only hiked about 1/2 mile when I heard what I thought was a Deer startle, but I didn't see it, then I heard a bunch of Deer startle, and didn't see them yet, I was looking through some low bushes and sparse brush through the trees for the deer and about 60 feet away on the flat ground I spotted 3 dark brown or black short 2 foot long animals on the ground, they were moving quick, I was trying to process what they were, wild pigs? boar? I couldn't see tusks but had only a glimpse of them when suddenly about 7 more jumped up out of the brush and the herd was running, away, good for me I thought.
Hmm,  things that make you go hmmm.","Hickory Flats USFS251

Pilgrim Billbones,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567474,"17.5 through woods and moderate climb.
The night at Hogpen Gap elevation > 3000 ft was worrisome. The wind was extreme, guessing
40 to 50, 60? mph roaring almost steady. We camped in an open field area, which was calm earlier in the evening, mistake, nothing to stop the wind when it cranked up.
Woke up middle of night and I could see the stars out the top of my tent, which meant, the
fly covering the top of my tent was missing. Also, I had to pee. I was afraid to leave the tent.
The ground was rocky and the tent was barely staked. I figured if I got out of the tent to look for my fly
and pee, the tent would blow off the mountain quickly. So I stayed in, it wasn't raining, and toughed it out till morning. The fly was still attached at one corner in the morning, glad to hike off that mountain.","Woody Gap Ga 60
