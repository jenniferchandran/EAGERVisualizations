Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560803,"Rain both Monday and Tuesday night. Very over cast and cloudy today with showers. Feels great to have a hot shower tonight and a solid roof over my head. My little red tent did a great job keeping me dry and warm. Thank you again to my wonderful co-workers for that gift. I love my home on the trail. Feet are doing great, legs are tired at the end of the day. My calf ""muscles"" complaine even in the AN but that will get better as the weeks continue. I had a beautiful owl visit for breakfast yesterday morning, I'll include his picture. Having fun what a great adventure. I'll get back to you in a few days.","

Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561475,"So 4/20 was a long day of11.5 miles as planned after a dry soft bed in Neel's Gap. Slept in tent at Low Gap Shelter a little rain during the night but a great day. Then off to Blue Miuntain Shelter 8 miles away. Warm, sunny hot day , shorts maybe better then these pants! Rain during the night off to tray Mountain Shelter 2 mountains away. Beautiful view of the mountains for dinner. Rain started at 8 PM and didn't stop! Oh well hiking in the rain is expected. Makes my pack feel heavier! I disliked Kelly's Knob last year in the sunshine. It was really nasty in the wind, rain, and cold this time. The rain turned to sleet on the top at 4126 feet. Thankful for my base layers today. And I thought shorts would be good! Staying the night in a shelter to get out of the rain! Today is a day off at Top of Georiga Histel!! Shower, shampoo, clean clothes. I'm loving it. Heading North tomorrow.","Top of Georgia Hostel

Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562505,"Well I departed Hiswassee, GA after stuffing myself at the $8.00 all you can eat Buffett. Only did 5 miles on 4/26, easy day. Stayed at Plumorchard Gap Shelter, housing for 14 and there were only 4 of us. So the next morning we decided to do 7.3 on Wednesday crossing the GA-NC border just before noon. If I thought those hills in Georgia were bad, the climb from Bly Gap to Courthouse Bald was 1000 feet straight up. I thought NC would be friendlier. Wednesday night we stayed at Muskrat Creek Shelter, the rain started early morning. At 5.4 miles we gave up and stopped at Standing Indian Shelter, made for 8. About 30 of us spent five hours waiting out the wind and rain. Thankfully 6 young guys were there with their hiking guitar and we spent the time signing and enjoying life. The rain broke at 6 PM and many of the young people moved on. In the morning we started to Carter Gap Shelter with some discomfort in my left heel. Nice weather for hiking. The rock climb up to Albert Mountain fire tower was unbelievable. I was thankful that we worked on upper body strength also, as several times I took off my 30 lb pack and threw it up the rocks before I climbed the rocks. I thought this part was in the New England part of the trail. But Oh the view at 5250 feet above sea level ! I believe I really could we Clearwater from there. Coming down the other side was much easilier and we hit the 100 miles on the trail mark. Saturday night found us at Long Branch Shelter and would you believe a nurse from Witt5 was there!! It's a small world. Good old Baycare, it was great to meet her. So this morning it was down the mountain to Franklin, NC and a hostel to clean up. I'm taking a zero day tomorrow to see what he thinks about the tendinitis in my left heel. I would sooner take care of it early and not let it get worse. I'm having a great time, meeting a lot of interesting people. All ages and sizes, a lot of the young people smoke. Talk with you again soon. I have wifi so I'll send some pictures.","

Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562624,"A little delay here in Franklin, NC, I have a tendinitis in my left foot so I'm off the trail a few days. Rest, ice, elevation, and hydration will make it good as new. So I'm at the hostel taking it easy.","

Inchworm,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563691,"After Saturday's short day the foot felt OK, so off I went on Sunday headed North. By 5 miles into the day I knew that the foot was very unhappy. A nice couple gave me a ride back to the hostel. Since it appears that this foot thing needs more attention than I had planned I am flying up to Pa for medical care before returning to the AT. My dog is also having some issues that I need to care for. So no new entry until I'm back on trail.","Franklin, NC
