Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562504,"It's time to pursue a life-long dream:
a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. Where this dream originated, I
don't know. Seems it's been on my heart at least since high school
days. My first experience with this particular trail came over two
long weekends during my senior year at the Naval Academy in 1973 when
it was possible to drive three hours to Shenandoah National Park and
head either north or south. It would be another 30 years before the
next opportunity to hike on it came about, and I have been able to do
three sections totaling 800 miles since then. But at last
retirement has come, and the opportunity to fulfill the dream of a
full thru-hike has fallen into my lap.
This is a low-tech hike, meaning no
cell or smart phone. Definitely showing my age, eh? A key
side-effect of this is that this blog can only be updated when I can
get to a computer off the trail with internet access. That usually
means a public library. Sound like the Stone Age? Any rate, there
could easily be seven or more days between updates, so I hope you
kind folks won't give up on me when there's a long gap like that. 
There will be a digital camera along to record a visual record for my
own benefit in order to revisit the hike in the years ahead. Old men
enjoy reminiscing, after all.
On Sunday, May 7 I meet up with my
brother Kevin in Ann Arbor, MI to take Amtrak to Harpers Ferry WV. 
Kevin is coming along just because he loves riding trains. Upon
arrival in Harpers Ferry May 8 (the train station is a few hundred
yards from the AT) I'll head north into Maryland. If the schedule
holds, around August 1 I'll make my way by bus/plane/train from the
north end of the AT at Katahdin in Maine back to Harpers Ferry to
pick up the hike once again and head south. This kind of hike is
called a 'flip-flop' thru-hike.
Ten resupply boxes are prepared: two
mailed by me prior to starting; two mailed by my favorite
better-half, Lyn; and six by daughter Laura. Thanks Lyn and Laura! 
The rest of the supplies will be purchased along the way.
Lots of hikers prefer to avoid sleeping
overnight in shelters due to mice, snoring, and/or noroviruses, so
they pack a hammock or tent for use most nights. I'm okay with the
mice and snoring (probably contribute more than my share of the
latter), and hope to escape norovirus issues, so most nights will be
spent in shelters. But I do have a plastic home-made tarp to sleep
under for the occasions when a shelter is not available to me.
I'm starting out with my summer-weight
sleeping bag, a key reason for starting when I am in May. Hopefully
I can endure any late-Spring cold-snaps and then also the White
Mountains in New Hampshire with it. Upon reaching southern Virginia
early September, Lyn will be mailing a heavier bag to me in
preparation for the Roan Highlands and then Great Smoky Mountains
National Park.",,Home,"Apr 30, Sun",0
Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563042,"A number of friends and family members
have chosen to be in prayer for me and with me during this six months
of hiking. Thanks all of you! I am in awe that such an adventure
like this is even possible, and that would be due to God's grace. 
How blessed I am to be able to accumulate enough wealth and time to
be able to venture in the woods for half a year. Few people in the
history of mankind have been able to do such a thing. So this
adventure has a good bit of the sacred in it: Visits to the tops of
beautiful mountains with phenomenal views while mixed with days of
misery from mosquitoes, heat, cold and rain. Engaging the
fascinating community of my fellow hikers with all their qualities
and foibles. Testing my limits physically, emotionally and
spiritually.
If you care to, join me in praying for
my safety from trips and falls, from the ever-present danger of Lyme
disease, and a norovirus-free hike. Please pray for Lyn in my
absence. And lastly, pray that I will be able to honor my Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ throughout the journey. Thanks in advance!

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563043,"Living in Sarnia, Ontario which is flat
as a pancake, it is difficult to train well for a hike like this. 
The month between my retirement early in April and the beginning of
the hike has involved alternating days working out at the gym (three
hours per day) and walking along a nature trail (up to 18 miles
daily). This will definitely be a help, but the true conditioning
will only happen as the hike unfolds. The younger hikers who began
at the south end in Georgia in March will be blowing past me that
first month.
A note on my trail name of Traffic
Director. Using trail names is a typical part of long-distance
hiking. Most of them come from one of two places: some hikers give
themselves a name; but for purists, they allow other hikers to assign
them a name. Such a name could be given due to some quirk in
character or behavior, some incident along the way, or the like. For
example, a hiker who frequently and conspicuously passes gas might
get called “Back Fire”, or someone who starts the hike with 90
pounds in the backpack might get named “U-Haul”. My trail name
is one given me by fellow hikers during my 2005 section hike. About
three weeks into the hike, four thru-hikers and I were on the public
bus in Hanover NH headed from a motel on the edge of town where we
had spent the night back to where the trail would resume. The driver
of the bus made the mistake of turning directly into the path of an
oncoming car, causing an accident which blocked both lanes of the
road. Being a good citizen, I hopped off the bus and started
directing traffic around the accident site until police could arrive
and handle it. Seeing this, one of the other hikers said, “Clearly
you are Traffic Director.”",,View Entry,"May 04, Thu",0
Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564846,"Rick and Bridget Venne (thanks a million, friends!) drove me to Ann Arbor MI train station where I met up with my brother Kevin.  We bused to Toledo OH to catch the overnight Chicago to Washington Capital Limited train.  It was a pleasant trip and I got maybe 4 hours of sleep.
It was sunny and 60 degrees when we debarked in HF.  I grabbed a deli sandwich for dinner, and we set off across the Potomac River into Maryland around 12:30.  The river was high and there is a lot of water from a month of rain.  Just beyond the bridge the AT heads east on the former C&O Canal towpath for 3 miles.  Easiest walking in the world and a lot of walkers and bikers despite an early May Monday.
Just after starting up the long slog to the top of South Mountain, Kevin had a word of prayer with me and headed back.  Then it felt like my life-dream adventure had truly begun. After the first lengthy up of the hike I reached this shelter.  So far the only one here at 3:30 pm.
It will be a serious test of my gear tonight to see if I brought enough layers of clothes to off-balance the light-weight summer sleeping bag.  Will I get good sleep or be miserable?

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564847,"With all layers of clothes on, I stayed warm last night except for the feet (which had 5 pairs of socks on!)  What with a short-mileage day planned, I stayed in the bag until the sun could warm things up.  Thru-hikers Bear Spray and Million Bucks who stayed in the second level of the shelter last night (and doing far more miles than me) were gone well before me.
This was a beautiful stretch of trail following the ridge line of South Mountain.  It was all a tunnel of trees with no decent views.  At Crampton's Gap were the various monuments and signs commemorating the battle fought there in 1862 as a part of the Antietam campaign.
Yesterday while getting water from the spring at the shelter I saw two white-tailed deer up close.  Today I got within 50 feet of a coyote who then saw me and skedaddled.
It was bright sunny and cool all day: I barely got to sweating at any point.  Tonight promises to be chilly again just like last night.
This is a beautiful shelter once again also with two levels in it.  A fully-flowing spring is about 100 yards away.  So far it just me, but then I'm here early.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564849,"Once again wearing all my layers last night, but at least my feet didn't get cold.  Another beautiful sunny day dawned with pleasant temperatures... at least once you get into cold hiking clothes and getting hiking a ways.
Today was very nostalgic: I walked over the South Mountain footbridge that spans I-70.  How many times since my teen years have I ridden under that bridge and then daydreamed that someday I would hike over it.  Is it possible that day has arrived?
There were a ton of people out walking the trail today, most of them day hikers.  There are a couple of scenic cliffs with fantastic views of the valley below, and I suspect those are the draw.  I also walked through Fox Gap where another battle in the Antietam campaign was fought with the usual collection of signs and memorials located there.
Tonight I'm at a campsite that has a dozen separate areas for tenters.  The place is probably hopping in summer, but today just one other tenter (with dog) is here.  Time to once again try out my trusty tarp system in lieu of an actual tent.  This hopefully will need to happen few times this hike.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564851,"I was all packed up and gone by 8 AM.  A group of six tents full of higher schoolers arrived last night and it was a circus.  They chose to tent within 50 feet of me, so my hopes for a quiet evening evaporated.  (Do you know how squirrelly they can be when they are trying to impress others of the opposite gender?)
And it was a good thing I was gone by 8 because it began raining 30 minutes later.  After a couple hours the wind picked up and turned things into a cold, miserable day of getting soaked.
At the halfway point I met a veteran (Hilton) with his service dog (Forest) and friend (Northern Light) who is doing the entire trail as an exercise in healing from PTSD.  He offered me a sip of whiskey, so he's apparently counting on more than a dog and the girlfriend to make this happen.  Many thanks to guys and gals like Hilton who have served their country and paid a significant price for having done so.
I pulled into this beautiful two-deck shelter just as four section hikers were leaving into the rain.  It was a race for me to get out of wet clothes, into dry camp clothes, and into my sleeping bag to warm up and avoid hypothermia.  A while later I was joined by Pancho and Idgie who are my age and from Kentucky, thru hikers who began in Georgia in February.
It rained steadily until 4-5 PM, and the wind blew well into the night.  Needed all my clothes again to keep warm, and I could have used more than I had.
Thanks to the Maryland AT volunteers!  Your trail and shelters are fabulous.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564853,"The wind was completely quiet and only occasional drip came from the trees at daylight.  The hardest part of a hike seems to be getting out of a warm sleeping bag and putting on the wet hiking clothes from the day before, all the way down to skivvies and socks.  BRRRR!  Lyn would say that's one more reason not to go hiking.
Poncho and Idgie left before me with plans for a longer day.  It was cloudy all day with a high of maybe 50 degrees, and that is about ideal for hiking.  Minimum sweat!  My body heat largely dried out the clothes by the time I got here.
I crossed into Pennsylvania about 5 miles in.  This shelter is a dandy, with two 4-person lean-tos side-by-side.  One is labelled ""snoring"" and the other ""non-snoring"".  Two other section hikers are here so far.
Along the way I passed No Rush.  You can tell  his hiking philosophy from his trail name.  He was sitting alongside the trail having a smoke break, being about half a mile into his day's hike.  I'm not sure he's going to make it to Maine this year.
It's my son Mark's 40th birthday today.  Wow!  I'm much to young for this.  Mark and I have enjoyed a pair of hikes with a ton of adventures included.  Have a great day, Billy!

It started raining at 5 PM yesterday and continued to about 7 AM today.  All day it threatened rain with occasional drizzle, and remained cold.  It's cloudy and 52 degrees now at 3 PM.  Another chilly night ahead.
This shelter is a legend on the trail, many calling it the best.  It is lovingly cared for by caretaker Jim.  The shelter has flowers in pots, a flowing stream cutting in front, a 2-person swing, and a deep spring just steps away.  A 5-star experience.
Today I crossed highway U.S. 30.  Just imagine that were you to head west far enough on it, you'd go within 10 miles of the town where I spent my high school years (and met Lyn): Dysart, Iowa.
Tomorrow I cross the trail's mid-point.  Thru-hikers often celebrate it by eating a half-gallon of ice cream at one go.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564859,"It was hard to keep warm last night what with the sky clearing and temperature dropping.  But morning broke sunny, and what with an immediate long up from the shelter, I got quickly warmed up.
Today's hike was as good as it gets: easy trail path, minimal rocks, no humidity, a dry and gentle north wind, sunning, and NO BUGS!  I was able to do the 13.8 miles with only one stop which was for lunch.  Pennsylvania has yet to show its teeth.  That will come, be assured.
This is the first day of being able to sit and write in this journal without being cold while doing it.  Maybe warm weather (with its sweat and bugs) is almost upon us.
Today I met Curly Q and Tenacity, two women doing the same flip-flop thru-hike beginning in HF that I am.  But they have taken two weeks to get to this point, having endured both flu and a twisted ankle.  You ladies can do it!

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564861,"One last chilly night before a big warm-up arrives.  With a big day planned, I was out of the shelter and gone by 7:30 into a beautiful, sun-lit day.
Some three miles down the trail I came to Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  Most important feature there is the camp store where thru-hikers who have reached this midway point eat a half-gallon of ice cream to celebrate. Unfortunately the store is only open on weekends until later in May, so my chance to get something to eat did not materialize.  But, what is this?  A Coke machine!  I put in my dollar and out came a frosty Cherry Coke.  Wahoo!  Two of a hiker's best friends: sugar and caffeine.  It charged me up for the five miles.
It was a delightful day again, and the first 16 miles flew by.  The last three were a much stronger challenge with scrambling on hands and knees over rock formations and what seemed like a maze.
Talking to NOBO hiker Farley here at the shelter, I have committed to breakfast in Boiling Springs tomorrow, four miles from here.  Here's the proof of commitment: Tonight I ate tomorrow's breakfast along with my dinner.  :-)

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564863,"What a great day!  It was time to ease off and do some personal care.  Only fly in the ointment is a large blister on the back of the left heel.  If you hear nothing more about it, then my care of it has been a success.
It turned out cooler than I expected last night, again requiring all my clothes to keep warm.  Sunrise came with the sound of a tom turkey nearby giving his frequent gobbles.
Being in no rush, it was 8:30 before getting away into a sunny and eventually 78 degree day.  The first goal was Boiling Springs, 4 miles away.  What a nice town with a large pond loaded with ducks and geese alongside the trail.  First stop was 101 Cafe for breakfast.  Farley had left the shelter before me, and I expected to see him there.  But no Farley.  Turns out he missed a trail marker and ended up taking an hour to get back on track.  Oh the hazards of thru hiking!  So he came in a while after.  My large stack of pancakes, large orange juice, and 2 cups of coffee were a delight.  Next stop was the outfitter for a replacement pack cover.  Last  stop was the post office to pick up a re-supply box with 7 days of food.  Around 11:30 the hike north continued for the final 8 miles.
This brought me to the second goal: the Days Inn at Carlisle PA.  First things first: I quickly stripped and got  a bath.  The color of the water when done was disgusting: I'll spare you the details.  Then next it was to do laundry, and 16 quarter dollars and an hour later, it was done.  Still on the agenda: updating this trail journal, calling Lyn, a dinner at Denny's, and one more shower to finish cleaning up.  All of these things except the Denny's can be done at this hotel.  And what with it being just .2 miles from the trail, you can see how sweet this place is.  Hiker's discount to boot!
Today's hike was mostly crossing the flat Cumberland Valley, walking through cornfields (with no corn sprouting yet) and stretches of trees. Tomorrow will be the last four miles of the valley, then back up on top of the next mountain ridge over.
Next journal update will likely be in 8 days or so.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566006,"The day began by taking advantage of the hotel's complimentary breakfast.  There were two busloads of tourists (one group of Chinese and one group of South Asians) who had spent the night in the hotel, and with both buses leaving at 7:30 AM the breakfast room was packed with people.  It was necessary to keep the elbows going in order to self-serve the breakfast items.  It was hysterical to see one of the tour conductors trying to get three women to finish their breakfast and get on the bus:  they were having nothing of it, and it took 30 minutes after the first call to get on.
Off at 8 AM to walk the .2m along Highway 11 back to the pedestrian overpass which is the trail and continue north.  The forecast was for a record high 90 degrees and we weren't disappointed.  The first four miles were the remainder of the level Cumberland Valley stretch including walking alongside a couple fields of alfalfa.  Glad I don't have allergies.
Then back up on the mountain ridge and our first stretch of the notorious Pennsylvania rocks.  A fellow hiker who was following minutes behind me later asked me:  ""How did you miss it??""  Miss what?  Apparently I walked right past a coiled rattlesnake which he subsequently saw and persuaded to move from the trail.  My guess is that he was lounging just off the trail when I went past, and my activity caused him to go into defensive mode.  Reminds me to thank those of you who are praying for me.
Tonight I have a newly married couple (Cheese and Coyote) who are hiking the entire trail as their honeymoon.  What do you think, Lyn?  They have to finish by July 24 so that Coyote can get to medical school in Minnesota for the beginning of her training.  Also have a 5-man church group join us who are doing a weekend 2-nighter.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566007,"Since I was anticipating eating breakfast in Duncannon PA, it was an early and quick start.  The morning was way too warm at 6:30 and did not bode well for what would be another record hot day in the 90's.  The trail down from Hawk Rock into town was very tough and rocky: hard on the knees.
As much as I like coffee with my pancakes, today was no day for a diuretic.  Large glasses of milk, orange juice and water gave me the chance to camel-up on the fluids.  I then loaded 3 quarts of water and had just enough to get to the shelter.  If this is Pennsylvania in May, what will it be like in Virginia in August?
Coming out of Duncannon the trail crosses first the Juniata and then the Susquehanna... a pair of wide and shallow rivers both close to flood level with all the rain the past month-plus.  Then came a 1000' rise to get back on the mountain ridge.  Apart from some boulder scrambling, the trail was straight-forward.
The big challenge was at the shelter: getting down to the spring requires negotiating 300 stone steps on the way.  Even worse is hauling the water back up.  I had managed to quit sweating by resting at the shelter at the end of the day's hike, but I was completely drenched again by the time I got back up from the spring carrying my 5 quarts of water.  That was at the end of a day where my body was more than ready to call it quits.
I'm here tonight with Negotiator, a 69-year old man who started in Georgia and can now hike circles around me, and with Okay who is a young man who began in Harpers Ferry same day as me and with the same flip-flop thru hike planned.

It was a grind throughout the day with no rewards of nice vistas.  Everything to see was woods (the AT is often called The Long Green Tunnel).  One interesting spot was an abandoned coal mining community on top of the Sharp Mountain ridge.  Seems an odd spot for a village: what a chore to haul those supplies up there.
Today was a first for me: a rattlesnake.  It was just off the path leading from this shelter to the privy.  Maybe 3' long and mostly black in color.  Good thing nature has yet to issue a call to me as getting to the privy sounds like an adventure in the making.
For the second night in a row I'm sharing the shelter with Negotiator (Alabama) and Okay (Chicago).  Negotiator is 4 years older than me, and his wife questions his sanity, too.

I delayed departure until the end of the rain, and it became my 3rd consecutive 17-mile day.  That's a bit much at this stage, but necessary because of the distances between shelters.  It'll be good to scale back the next few days.
The trail came off Sharp Mountain into the Swatara Gap, a nice level 2 miles of walking.  Immediately after passing under I-81 it was straight up 1000' to the top of Blue Mountain.  There were some rough stretches of rock on the trail including a rock field 400' in length that seemed to take forever to get through.
This shelter is a legend on the trail, named after the highway passing nearby.  It is fully enclosed with a huge skylight over a picnic table at the center.  There are six double bunk beds allowing 12 to sleep, and it looks like 8 of us will be here tonight: 7 men and 1 woman.  Most popular is that you can call to a nearby town for pizza and have it delivered to the parking lot at the highway .2m away.  Very popular call!

Had a double experience with trail magic.  First, someone brought a large collection of beverages to the shelter last night.  I enjoyed a bottle of Mountain Dew with dinner, and as delicious as it was it reminded me of why I should not drink caffeine in the evening (rather boring staring for a couple of hours at the bottom of the bunk above me).  A second batch was along the trail today where I spotted a cooler and a trash bag tied above it.  In the cooler was a selection of snack items.  I enjoyed a container of coffee pudding and a packet of jalapeno cheese with crackers.  Hikers love trail angels.
For my fourth consecutive night I'm sharing the shelter with Negotiator, Shivers, Shivers Dad, and Okay.  Okay began in Harpers same day as me and is doing the identical hike.

With the rain now falling, it was a slog back up from Port Clinton to the ridge line on Blue Mountain, the same distance up as it had been down on the other side.  I can feel my conditioning improving daily.
Poor Okay: he turned his ankle rather badly on one of the countless rocks, and now he'll have to take a couple of days off to heal.  Port Clinton's city park has a pavilion with water nearby and a washroom that hikers may use for free, so he really found the right place if he had to hurt himself.  As nice as the Port Clinton people are, I wouldn't be surprised if someone takes him in for a night or two.  Heal quickly, Okay!  See you up the trail.
I got to this shelter and quickly went 150' down to the stream for water, then came back to get out of sopping wet hiking clothes/hat/shoes/socks into dry camp clothes and into the sleeping bag for warmth.  Gotta avoid hypothermia!  A cold rainy day makes getting into a sleeping bag sound dreamy.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566017,"One thing that I'm learning is that when you have a spot on the map labelled with a ""pinnacle"" or ""pulpit"" or ""knob"" or ""tooth"" or ""knife's edge"", then lookout:  there will be tons of rocks and boulders, possibly for a mile or more.  Today proved the point with a 4-mile stretch of nearly continuous rock or boulder sections beginning just before Dan's Pulpit and ending just before this shelter.
The Pinnacle was also on today's trail, but at least it offered a superb view, one that some call the best in PA.  One thing I love is to be high on top and be able to see in the distance where I've been or where I'll be.  The Pinnacle did that.  I could see down the Blue Mountain ridge line east all the way to where it drops into Lehigh Gap, tomorrow's goal and 30 trail miles away (possibly 20 miles as the crow flies).  Glad it was a clear day making it possible to see.
Weather-wise it was a delightfully cool day with occasional sun.  For the first time in six nights we don't have Negotiator.  He decided he needed to start adding more miles, so he pushed on.  With me in this 8-person shelter are Moxie and Yard Sale, and a pair of section hikers Hannah and Mark.  Needed most of my clothes but not all, so gradually warming.  Time to drop one layer out of my pack and lighten up a bit.
Some outstanding trail magic today.  A pair of ladies day hiked into the shelter with their dog and brought fresh fruit and Oreos cookie packages, and packed out our trash.  Some people are incredible, and that's just a foretaste of how nice the people around Palmerton are proving to be.

There were 3 main obstacles to overcome:  the Knife Edge, Bear Rocks, and Bake Oven Knob.  These were the key reason I wanted to start so early as I figured it would add a lot of time to get through them, and I wanted to get to Palmerton by mid-afternoon.  Knife Edge is unique in that it is right on top of the ridge and consists of huge slabs of rock tilted up around 60 degrees.  Trekking poles are useless and the hands are needed to navigate through and on top of those sloping slabs.  On top of the world, but it would have been scary if the rocks had been wet.
In Palmerton I ended up at a delightful hikers hostel attached to the back of Bert's Steakhouse.  There are 2 sets of bunks and a pair of cots in a tiny room for sleeping.  A shower with towel and soap plus use of laundry are included in the $20 per night price.  Fabulous!  It's a few doors from the public library where I can update this journal.  A little farther down the street is a fresh fruit/vegetable market store with all the badly needed nutrition a hiker needs.  Strawberries, spinach, bananas, apples... heaven!
The shower and use of laundry were first on the agenda.  Now it's time for dinner at Bert's where I hear the food is plentiful, delicious and cheap.
Staying tonight in a full room are Dave the Aussie, Shivers, Shivers Dad, Paul Bunyon, Laken and her dog Dixie, and myself.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567116,"Off from the hostel into a beautiful day, using the hostel shuttle to get me the 2 miles to the trailhead (sure beats walking!)  Right off the bat was the rock scramble up from Lehigh Gap.  I found it necessary to take my pack off 3 times and push it and the trekking poles up and over the rock I was trying to climb.  A 50-ish hiker named Pinkie was really struggling with this, and so I got the opportunity to hump her pack up and over that stretch as well.  Nice to be able to give out trail magic as well as receive it.  It was sunny with a bracing dry wind making the ascent otherwise a delight with fantastic views on those totally denuded rocks going up.
Once back on top of the ridgeline (about 1000' higher) it was a straightforward hike here, though the persistent rocks over most of the distance proved wearying mentally and physically.  You have to focus on every step to keep from tripping or turning an ankle.
This is an older shelter sleeping six but with seven of us in it, so tight company!  the other six are all new  hikers for me:  Ace, Doc, Powerhouse, Tofu, Medicine Man and one south-bounder guy.  Powerhouse and Tofu are from Germany.  Though she's 1200 miles into her hike (starting in Georgia at the southern terminus of the trail), Powerhouse is having severe foot chafing and blistering issues.
Should be a delightful though chilly night for sleeping.
Enjoyed trail magic from an 80-something man named Donald.  Out of the trunk of his car I got a fruit drink and chocolate bar.  He was just sitting in a parking lot along the trail greeting all the hikers and blessing them.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567119,"Getting up into a bright sunny morning seemed to cause my breakfast of a cup of granola cereal in milk (powdered) hit the spot.  I was gone at 7:45 for the longest day so far.  The rocks over the first half wore me out, but the trail improved a lot over the second half of the day.  Otherwise I would not have made it this far.
This hostel is a donation-basis section of Church on the Mountain in Delaware Water Gap, PA.  They have a dozen bunks and a shower, or you can tent on the church grounds.  Moxie, Yard Sale, Negotiator (yes, again!), Tofu and Powerhouse are all here for the night.
Being Memorial Day weekend there were dozens of day hikers and a few overnighters including a boy scout troop that I encountered on the trail coming into DWG.  But the cutest couple was a 20-something pair with a large dog named Zeus.  They had large packs and had just finished the 2.5 mile slog up from DWG to Mount Minsi where I was having my last water break of the day.  They were exhausted and thought the next shelter was a mile away.  I had to break the bad news that it was actually 4 miles away.  Then I learned this was the first day of a hike for them to North Carolina.  After a bit I noticed something odd about her backpack.  Lo and behold she was carrying their cat in there!  You meet all kinds of people on the trail, eh?  I'm skeptical they'll last a week, but one never knows.  They are definitely woefully under-prepared which can be a bit scary (been there, done that, right Billy?)

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567122,"This was a tremendous day.  It dawned sunny and cool and remained pleasant all day.  At 10 AM the worship service at this hostel's church began.  About 50 people were there including 15 in the choir.  Most special was when the choir sang a variation of the Navy Hymn to commemorate Memorial Day.  (The Navy Hymn was sung every Sunday in the academy chapel service while I was there.)  That brought back memories of the dozen classmates of mine from Annapolis who lost their lives in the line of service, as well as Chic Burlingame who was pilot of the plane crashed into the Pentagon.  They sang it beautifully and had no clue how it spoke to this old sailor.
A shuttle driver was hired and I was then driven to a spot on the trail 13.5 miles out so that I could hike back here to the hostel: something we call slackpacking because of the miniscule weight you get to carry.  The drive itself was an adventure too long to relate here, but briefly the driver had no clue where he was going after repeatedly telling me he'd taken hikers there before.  We ended at a dead end not terribly far from the top of the ridge line with a woods road appearing to lead from the dead end upwards, so I paid my $20 and got out to finish getting to the top.  Yes, that's the short story.  After cutting the trail (finding the white blazes) at the top, I then knew to head south back to this place.  Not at all complicated, but not what I had in mind or actually contracted for.
Upon getting back here to DWG at 5:30 (90 minutes later than originally planned due to the lost driver) I passed an ice cream shop which also serves light lunch.  Boy, did those two hot dogs, fountain soda, and chocolate malted milk ever taste great!
Now I'm back at the church hostel for a second night.  Both Medicine Man and Powerhouse took zero days and are here too.  Also the AT ridge runner named Nick (his job is to look after shelters and hikers along a 30-mile stretch of trail.)  Tomorrow I have a different driver lined up to take me back to the trail so I can continue north (this time with full pack), and hopefully he DOES know how to get to the Millbrook-Blairstown crossing.

It was still raining when Kenny dropped me and continued for 2 more hours.  Apart from getting soaked and being cold (temperature in the 50s) this created one of the top hiking hazards: wet rocks.  For 5 hours I gingerly picked my way, careful with every step.  Despite that, I had a pair of hard falls when my feet flew out from under me on slick rock.  Apart from the damage to my pride, I arrived at the shelter with bloody abrasions on the right knee and both hands as well as a banged up right ankle and knee from an awkward landing and skid down the rock face.  That ankle has a mild sprain and is swollen.
But I'm safely at this recently built shelter in good spirits and very grateful for God's mercy that nothing worse happened.  It's done raining (hopefully for a few days).  This shelter has a metal box for placement of food due to a high population of black bears.

So the hike ended up being straightforward through the long green tunnel up and down the ridge, quite boring.  But oh so careful!  The mist from the fog kept the rocks wet and very slick.  Very wearying to have to watch every step.
This shelter was built by a CCC team back in the Great Depression.  Because it's .4m off the trail, it's hard to say if anyone will join me.  No one so far.  This part of New jersey has a lot of bears, so I'll be using the large metal bear box provided for food bags overnight.  Don't want to arm wrestle Smokey for tomorrow's food, especially if Smokey finds my bag in the shelter and decides to come in and contend for it.  That's been known to happen.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567125,"New Jersey finally got into my good graces.  The six hikers who ended up tented around the shelter (where I was the only one sleeping) and I had light rain overnight and awoke to fog.  It was a few degrees warmer than the previous few nights, and when I got to the High Point State Park later in the morning they were showing 53 degrees.
Trail Magic occurred at the park headquarters which is adjacent to the AT.  When I went inside to use the washroom and to register my passing through, the clerk asked if I was a thru hiker.  When I said yes, she said they had a Pepsi to pass out to me.  Was that ever good!  Even on a cold, misty morning it was awesome.
Upon arriving at the park's lookout tower from where you are supposed to be able to see New York City's skyscrapers on a clear day, all I could see was fog.  But the sun was just starting to burn through and in an hour the day turned gloriously clear.  Down off the mountain the trail went and finally getting clear of the rocks that have plagued us since Duncannon.
In full sun but fairly cool temperatures we had a great day walking through open fields with fantastic views.  We must have crossed 2 dozen stone fences, built 300 years ago by the first pioneers to fence in (or out?) their livestock.  Imagine first having to clear the trees only to find the land infested with every sized rock.  What a tough existence.
The village of Unionville issued an irresistible call to me as the trail passed by, so I stashed my pack and poles by  the trail and went the .3m to a general store.  A bottle of orange juice, a donut, a pint of moose track ice cream, and a cup of coffee got me into a mellow mood to finish the last 6 miles.
The trail took us for 2 flat miles around the Wallkill National Wildlife Preserve, a huge inundated area with all kinds of birds and critters.  Because it's been so cool and wet, there were no mosquitoes to harass the hiker, though that is soon to change no doubt.  It was superb on a bright afternoon.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567126,"Twas a wild and woolly night.  Around 10 PM I was awakened to the distant sound of swooshing.  Slowly coming out of my sleepy fog I began to also hear thunder.  For the next 15 minutes it grew louder with almost continuous lightning until it was upon us.  Amazing how you can hear a heavy rain coming from such a long distance when you're in the silent woods.  It poured like crazy for 20 minutes and then seemed to pass.  Then a second storm was upon us with crazy lightning and huge thunder bursts right over us, but fairly brief.  It was all over in an hour.  Where did that thin line of severe thunderstorms come from?  It wasn't in the forecast (would you believe 0% chance of rain?)
The hike took us through a wetlands on a wooden elevated walkway full of day hikers for more than a mile.  Later we crossed a large pasture on a double-plank walkway.  Being fully out in the sun with a great breeze was a delight.  Relish these cool days!  They won't last.
At the end of the pasture the AT crossed NJ route 94, and 200 yards north is Heaven Hill Market.  Traffic Director heard the call and responded:  how could I not?  An hour of feasting on a large strawberry pastry, a banana, a large bowl of ice cream, an orange juice, and a large coffee prepped TD for the next challenge.
Immediately north of NJ 94 is a rise of 1000' with the trail having hundreds of large rocks laboriously built into it, the stretch being called the Stairway to Heaven.  Tons of day hikers were doing that stretch up and down as well because of a superb rocky overlook near the top.  Another 4 miles of ups and downs brought me to this shelter.  Powerhouse and Medicine Man are both here tonight as well.
Today was the first day of pesky bugs wanting to get into the eyes.  No doubt bug season is arriving and will be a factor for weeks to come.  TD is not looking forward to black flies.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567129,"It got down into the upper 40s overnight, on June 2 no less!  That pointed to a refreshingly cool day.  Because I was coming into town, I was up early and gone not long after 6:30 with a completely empty food bag.  We finished New Jersey and entered New York.
The rock formation is quite different in that the layers of rock are completely vertical.  This causes them to break and shape quite differently from the 60 degree slant in PA and NJ.  The trail went across a ridge line for 3 miles on massive rocks with numerous demanding pull-ups and slide-downs, often having to toss the poles ahead so that both hands would be free for scrambling.  Very tiring.  But being a completely clear day with dry air, there were multiple spots where the tops of the skyscrapers of Manhattan could be seen over the top of the mountain to the east: probably 20 miles away or so.  The lower Manhattan towers (where the Twin Towers would have been) to the right, and the midtown Manhattan towers to the left.
Around 10:30 I began down a side trail .9m off the ridge line into this very quaint town of Greenwood Lake NY.  It's a resort community due to the very large lake that stretches from here south into New Jersey.  This hotel is fantastic:  cash only; run by a 70-something woman named Vera; and right on the lake with a view of a marina right out my door.  There's no laundry facility in the town, so I'm having to do that in the sink.  Two guys are in the room adjacent to me, and they have Brooklyn accents to die for.
Key to this side trip is to pick up a re-supply box sent by daughter Laura to me.  Thanks Tootsie!  Also another fantastic letter from Krista and the two grands including some artwork and a photo of TD holding Joanna last winter.  Can't get a man's heart any warmer than that.

I was gone from the motel at 7:30 and back on the AT at 8.  Not only was the mileage long, but the terrain was especially tough, making this the longest day of hiking in my life time-wise: over 10 hours.  That means I netted less than 2 MPH which is a reflection of the gnarly-ness of things.  Bright sunshine and a cool NW wind were a big help in easing conditions, however.  How much harder if it had been 90 degrees.
There was a lot of trail magic along the way, mostly jugs of water placed near road-trail junctions.  All told I must have drunk a gallon of it.  And one unusual trail magic: just before crossing a road there was a sign on the ground welcoming hikers to go to a nearby parking lot, open the rear door of a tan Camry located there, and help yourself.  I enjoyed a can of fortified water.  Thanks all you trail angels!

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567968,"Ah, the adventures of hiking and the necessity of flexibility.  Last night's shelter is known as being a ""high bear-activity"" shelter.  The shelter register (most shelters have registers where hikers sign in and advise other hikers of what's going on) had not indicated any problems with bears for a while.  In fact, Doc, Ace and Gofer had written day before yesterday that they were disappointed to have been there and not seen the Fingerboard Shelter bear.  Well, last night he showed up.
Both Powerhouse and I had put our food bags up in trees just as we're instructed to do when a shelter has no bear box or bear cables provided.  But we discovered this morning that he had gotten to them anyway.  Powerhouse's bag was on the ground and demolished.  Mine was still in the tree but had been moved 10 feet closer to the trunk where it apparently got stuck, and the bottom of the bag was shredded so that most of the contents fell out.  What a mess!  My Snickers bars, granola bars, and a bag of gorp were totally missing, wrappers and all.  The jar of peanut butter had been unscrewed (!) and half-eaten.  The bag of bagels was gone including the plastic bag.  Fortunately, the expensive freeze-dried food packets were largely untouched.  As a side note, the beefy tough hiker (trail name Bruno) who had come hoping to see a bear...  he heard the bear roaming around, stuck his head outside the tent with headlamp on, saw the green eyes, and made a beeline for the shelter for the rest of the night, not wanting to be alone in a tent.  As if Powerhouse and I were any level of protection!  What a laugh.
All of this meant diverting into town to resupply and figure out a new bag solution.  The day began again sunny and dry, but clouds bringing the next rainy spell were building.  About 2 hours before the end of the hike, drizzle began to fall and soon became a steady but light rain.  Temperatures were in the 60s, so it didn't feel unpleasant.  My only food option was to get into Fort Montgomery NY and find a convenience store as there's no grocery located there.  So after 15.1 miles credited to me the hike continued off the trail another 2 miles in a steady and now moderate rain along a busy highway with cars and trucks flying by whipping up spray.  But again not unpleasant and it's so easy to just walk along pavement or a sidewalk as compared to a trail loaded with roots and rocks and going steeply up or down.  Was I ever delighted to find this six-room motel with a sign saying ""vacancy"".  There's a convenience store, a BBQ restaurant, and a breakfast deli-cafe all a short distance away.  And a blessing:  some hiker had an extra, totally unused bag that is perfect for food, and left it at the motel for someone else to use if necessary.  Wahoo!
Last surprise of the day?  Two doors down in #2 is Medicine Man!  Unbeknowst to me, he also came into town to resupply and stay here.  We'll go to the BBQ this evening.
Very serendipitous!  Getting soaking wet but getting to get into a motel to shower and largely dry out.  And game 2 of the NBA playoffs on TV!  However, I had planned six additional miles today and not getting them done means I am now officially one day behind schedule.  That surprises me at the four-week mark to be this close to the schedule, so no complaints here.
Back to the AT tomorrow.  The motel owner gives a free shuttle back.  He ought to, judging by the price to stay here.

Breakfast today was an experience.  100 yards from the motel is a deli/cafe in a former motorcycle dealership.  The owner is Perry, a man with a great New York accent.  He clearly loves to cook (and eat his cooking), and he has a lot of atmosphere in his place.  As Medicine Man and I ate, a stream of locals stopped by for coffee and deli sandwiches for the day at work.  Lots of banter.
Right off the bat the trail crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge, built in 1924 and at that time the world's longest suspension bridge.  That is the lowest point of elevation on the entire trail which means one thing: the hiker will be immediately going way up.  The first three miles you could hear bursts of rifle fire, coming no doubt from West Pointers at their rifle range (only about 2 miles from the AT for a long stretch).  An awful lot of bullets, boys and girls.  Need a Middie to come teach you how to shoot straight?  Hah!
What with rain and T-storms due later today and a long distance between shelters, this turned into a short day.  This place had been my goal for yesterday, but the bear messed it up.  This is a friary for the Franciscans, noted for their hospitality to travelers.  For 40 years they have made a facility available for hikers.  Best is a covered picnic pavilion where we can stay (and gets out of the rain: key reason for being here).  But they also provide a faucet and a port-a-potty.  Only .4m off the trail, and worth it.  But I am now officially one day behind my ideal schedule.

It was mostly dry in the morning with occasional  drizzle.  I was coming down Canopus Hill about 4 miles into the day when the Big Adventure began.  The trail being wet made everything very slick as usual.  Somehow when coming down a steep section I stepped on a very small root which possibly broke or slipped on me, but in any case my footing failed me and I did a head forward full fall on a down-hill slope.  The first body part that made contact with the ground was the forehead, and it hit a small rock in the trail covered by leaves and trail debris.  I heard (and felt) a cracking thudding sound, but did not go unconscious though I had blurred vision for 30 seconds.  It took a while to stop the bleeding, but finally things were organized, I could get to my feet without problem, and could continue the hike 15 more miles to this shelter.  What else was there to do?  No point sitting in the rain and pouting.
A few miles later I passed a state park with a building that had a faucet on the outside for hikers to use.  I cleaned up my handkerchief and my dew-rag, and saw that quite a bit of blood had come out.  Oh well, facial injuries can be bloody, and otherwise I feel fine.
Upon arrival at this shelter, Medicine Man took a long look at the wound (remember, I have no mirror so cannot see what's there) and said that it was very scabbed and probably a very deep wound.  He strongly advised me to get into town and get this taken care of, for infection if nothing else.  And he thought it might take a stitch or two.  Being in a remote shelter (there WAS a country road immediately at hand which is very unusual), this was going to be a big hassle and very expensive.  How about if I hike another day and then go into Pawling to get it looked at, a town I could reach in 20 miles?  Medicine Man remained insistent.  Without asking me, he called his wife Ginny on the cell phone (who happens to be a nurse) and put her to work.  She researched an urgent care facility in the area and several transportation options until she found a taxi company willing to come out and get me.  Then Medicine Man told me it was all possible and that I REALLY should go get it looked at.  So I gave in.  It took 20 minutes to go the 20 miles to Wappingers Falls NY urgent care facility ($35).  The doctor flushed the wound (that was the most painful part), put in seven stitches, and gave me a tetanus shot and antibiotic prescription.  When she told me she could see my skull, I knew this was the right decision.  $210 at the urgent care facility, $45 for a taxi to get me back to the shelter which was very difficult to find in the dark.  Everyone except Groceries was asleep when I got there.
Two awesome trail angels made it happen. Medicine Man persistently said I should really go in, and he took the initiative to get things lined up by way of his wife Ginny.  The other angel was Ginny herself.  She got on the internet and located both the urgent care center and a taxi company that would come get me.  None of that was possible for me to coordinate which is what made going another day to Pawling seeming to be the best solution.  I owe you two a lot!
Reviewing it all, clearly God's mercy was a work in a major way: the accident itself was phenomenally minor, all things considered (billions of rocks... could have broken ribs, teeth, face...); it's a shelter with a road at hand (rare); Mr and Mrs Medicine Man; urgent care and a taxi nearby.  Thanks to everyone who has been praying for me.  I have such a sense of God's hand over me.  And I haven't lost an extra day hiking!`

It was a warmer version of yesterday, one last day of cool-weather hiking.  Will we have any more of them this spring?  The first 15 miles mostly in New York were very pleasant with easy grades and good trail surface.  Then we arrive in Connecticut and all that changed.  The original AT was harshly built, often going almost straight up these hills, ridges and mountains without the switchbacking often in place now.  That last 6 miles clearly is part of the original.  Hopefully that changes soon.

Kent is a fascinating town.  They do not allow fast food franchises like McDonalds or Starbucks.  Everything is boutique-y, artsy, and expensive.  Even the outfitter has more touristy stuff than outdoors equipment and supplies.  Being a picture postcard kind of day, all the shops had their displays out on the sidewalk.  Some shoppers in my family would love this.  I ate superb food and had the best coffee by far on this hike.

Hope you had a platinum week, Glenn.  Thinking of you today.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568624,"I have come to the conclusion that long-distance hiking is for young people.  Today's 21.4 miles (life-time longest) simply wore me out. To add insult to injury, half a dozen 20-somethings of both genders who all started in Georgia 1500 miles back blew by me like I was standing still.  Here I am sitting at the shelter's picnic table eating my Mountain House dinner with legs and feet that feel exhausted.
Even worse:  they built this shelter .5m off the trail with a ferocious 300' drop to get to it!  That's not included in the 21.4.  Just getting started back to the trail tomorrow involves going back up that monstrosity.  Hopefully a 4-mile shorter day will help quiet the loud complaints coming from my lower body parts.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568625,"For the first night of the hike, last night I didn't need all my clothes to sleep warm.  It was also the first night I slept alone in a shelter.  That half mile off the trail with the big elevation drop is probably the reason: hikers avoid it.  But actually I wasn't totally alone: I saw a shelter mouse.  Not a problem though since he didn't bother my Snickers and I didn't bother his cheese.
We're experiencing the second big warm up of the hike, remarkably little for this late in the year.  It was mid-80s and all sun today, near 90 is forecast for tomorrow.  But when we get up higher in elevation, things are cooler.
Drinking enough water is a key challenge.  Due to a very wet Spring all the streams and springs are running fine with clear, cool water.  Love it!
We went over our first 2000' mountains of the hike, 3 of them to be exact: Bear, Pace and Everett Mountains, each higher than the previous.  The views from Pace were stunning on a clear day as the trail went along the edge with a sharp drop off for hundreds of feet immediately on the right hand.  I was at 2300' and the valley below at 800'.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568714,"The by-word for today was hot -- 90 degrees.  Not the best day for a 19 mile hike.  The up side is that the humidity isn't bad, so on the longer straight or slightly down stretches -- particularly if I could catch a breeze -- I actually would quit sweating for a while.
I ended up being the only person of any sort at last night's lean-to, and at 5 pm as I write this there is not another soul here.   Where has everyone gone?  Do I smell that bad?  (Only a week since my last shower...)
There was trail magic in the form of 6 gallons of spring water at the one the road crossings.  That was most welcome.  Last year when there was drought throughout the east, those water moments were priceless to hikers as springs were dry and streams almost non-existent.  That's not a problem this year, so the trail magic water isn't vital, just very nice and thoughtful.
Today the trail started on the mountain with a very severe down.  We then crossed a valley for 7 miles at about 800' elevation, following the Housatonic River.  Often we were skirting pastures with cattle or fields of hay or corn.  Then came the stiff ups to get back on the mountains which exhausts the hiker and makes him wringing wet in the heat: Mt June, Mt East, Mt Wilcox.  Up around 2000'.
The last fly in the hiking ointment was actually gaggles of mosquitoes.  There was one 10-minute stretch which for some reason was swarming with them.  Repeatedly I was swatting my arms and killing two or more a time, something that's tricky to do when walking as fast as you can with a trekking pole in each hand.
Oh, now I have three female hikers who have joined me for the night.  A mother-daughter combo (Goddess and Boss) are with me in the shelter, and Checklist has decided to tent in order to avoid the mosquitoes.

Mid-morning I reached a road-crossing with something beautiful.  Fifty yards down the road was a shack with 'Hikers Store' painted on the side.  Turns out a couple young people have set up a business which works on hiker honor.  A variety of snack items, beverages, and chicken and duck eggs (they raise them) were for sale.  Take what you want and put the money in the pouch.  My can of Pepsi, banana, and bag of Doritos was $3.  A steal and delicious on a hot day.  Just 15 minutes before arriving I had revisited my most recent fantasy, that of drinking a frosty can of Coke.  The fantasy has been with me for 3 days.  Imagine having the fantasy fulfilled!
Tonight's destination is a popular stop for hikers.  The cabin sleeps 14 in bunks, has kitchen and porch with rocking chairs, a caretaker who watches things, and a huge pond (we would call it a lake in Ontario) of crystal clear water and SWIMMING!  I couldn't wait to get my hot and sweaty self into that water.  Simply delightful!  Poor fish...  No Lyn, it wasn't skinny dipping.  Like all the hikers (men and women alike) I was in my skivvies.  No one has swim suits, of course.  Duh.  But then, wearing skivvies that haven't been washed in a week, they probably needed the lake time more than I did.  Have I over-shared?
I'm staying in the cabin with seven female hikers.  A couple of guys are tenting around about.  The growth of women hikers is one of the recent trends in the AT, the majority of them hiking solo but often ending up in pairs or triples.  Fortunately they have gone as long with a shower as I have, so we're all in the same level of hiker stench.  By the by, in case you're interested, it's my shoes that smell the worst.

It was a very straightforward hike with minimal longer ups and downs.  This stretch has some of the fewest strong ups and downs of the entire length of the trail.  But quite monotonous as there was only one vista the entire day.  Most of the time it was plugging away in the long green tunnel of trees and underbrush.  Some stretches hadn't been maintained in a long time, so the grass and shrubs were encroaching over a very narrow trail, and tree branches were everywhere at about the 5 1/2 foot level, and I pushed my face through hundreds of them.  That gets very wearying when you do it for hours at a time.
But at 3 pm I emerged from a long down into the delightful town of Dalton MA.  At the edge of town was trail magic in the form of squeeze containers of fruit juice.  Delicious!  I had made reservations at this motel for two nights, so they were ready for me on arrival.  Within 30 minutes I had taken my first blessed shower (you all may thank me) and in 30 more minutes the clothes were in the laundry provided by the motel (a second thanks is in order).  
The motel is a hoot.  The owner is a delightfully friendly and helpful woman named Laura who runs the office with her two cats and dog.  Her family members help her run the business.  I made a lengthy call to Lyn, getting to talk to her for the first time since the head injury 8 days ago.  Then I was able to do some emails on Laura's laptop.  Great folks, and a great stop!  Post office, library, convenience stores, restaurants all within a few hundred yards.  Perfect!

There were chores to be done.  Over to the post office 50 yards away to pick up my supply package mailed by Laura and Ben (thanks guys!) and also a nice letter from Krista, Joel and kids (thanks guys!)  I was able to send my medical receipts home in case I need them and a postcard to Dad.  Did I tell you he's 97 years old?  What a remarkable guy.  A trip to a grocery allowed me to finish up the resupply purchases.  Time spent doing more emails and updating this journal.  There's the mandatory large cup of coffee, of course.  Make that two cups.
I was able to locate a shuttle driver who took me to the urgent care unit three miles away.  Tom is an institution on the trail, having been helping hikers for 37 years.  It was a true pleasure to meet him after having heard so much about him.  Any rate, the stitches had to come out.  Another of God's marvelous blessings regarding the injury:  the stitches need to come out between 7 and 10 days of being put in, and here comes Dalton with an urgent care facility on day 9.  Yes, another $230, but it's only money!  I could have had a broken arm or ribs and ended up in an ER with thousands in costs.  Sorry, but no price can give me any sanity regarding doing this hike.
One side-advantage of the urgent care stop is that I was able to weigh myself and discover how much I am de-hydrated.  That's going to cause a small change in plans (which always means spending money, of course) allowing me to get some additional building-up of the body before resuming the hike.  More on that tomorrow.
Half the people staying here are, understandably, hikers.  So it's like a family reunion.

It was very chilly and windy on top, so I was glad to get scooting with the day pack he provided... maybe 3 pounds.The trail down is badly eroded making it exceptionally gnarly. After a couple miles it improved, but all day there was never an easy lengthy stretch of hiking trail. Nonetheless I did the 17 miles in 6.5 hours including a 30-minute detour to Dunkin Donuts in Cheshire and 15-minutes of chatting/breaks with hikers I met along the way. Oh to slackpack all the time!I met roughly 3 dozen northbounders during the day as they of course were headed the opposite direction from me as I was going southbound back to Dalton. Notables included: Goddess and Boss (who saw a moose this morning); Powerhouse (!); Medicine Man(!); Alps.

Traffic Director,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569780,"I was energized by the thought of town food getting up this morning.  The trail was a sharp drop down into the gorge which is the lowest point in Vermont for the AT.  Just after crossing the suspension footbridge came a highway.  .5m west was a restaurant named Whistle Stop for the caboose it's located in.  Sadly, after walking there along the highway, I saw a for sale sign on it.  Rats!  Now what?  But don't despair, I then noticed on down the road another .5m or so a sign for a deli/country store, so the trek continued.
it was a delight!  For breakfast -- eaten in a wicker chair on the front porch in beautiful sunshine -- I had a sausage and egg breakfast sandwich plus a blueberry and chocolate scone washed down with a quart of OJ.  And of course a mandatory cup of coffee -- how long has it been?  I also bought a second scone and bag of chips to take back to the trail for lunch.  Living the high life!  The first person I asked at the deli gave me a ride back to the trail.  In total the detour took one hour until resuming the hike.
The day was perfect for hiking: sunny and 70 degrees with some breeze.  The grand climax was the long haul (2100' elevation gain) up Killington Mtn to the highest point on the trail in VT.  The trail up is in exceptionally poor condition, being badly eroded from years of feet pounding on it.  Most every step was onto rock or tree roots, making each step that much more tiring both physically and the need for concentration.  All the soil has long ago washed away by rain.
This shelter is ancient with bunks that are dilapidated and sagging, but it will do.  Because of problems with people trashing it, the shelter is no longer maintained by the local AT maintenance club.  I was expecting a total disaster, but actually it was fine and just as welcoming as it was 12 years ago when I stayed in it.  The view is superb: I can see 3 mountain ranges to the west, the farthest being the Adirondacks in New York.

After eating, it was time to resupply for five days, go to the outfitter for a few equipment upgrades, and go to the post office to send a card to Dad.  Lastly I ended up at Mountain Meadows Lodge, a gorgeous rustic wedding venue which happens to be empty this weekend.  First thing was to take a bath, then go do my laundry.  The public library is open to 5:30, so off I'll go.

Trusting that Gerry knew what he was doing, I asked him to take me to the Pomfret/South Pomfret Road crossing of the AT.  That would have made a 12-mile day and cut off 22 miles to Hanover, miles I hiked in 2005.  But instead he delivered me to Range Road which is 15 miles from this shelter.  It was a couple hours before I figured it out because none of the roads are named with signs on the trail, nor are there signs for anything else like tops of hills/mountains.  This is the second time that local shuttle drivers who should know better messed up with my delivery.  Hikers beware!
The day was gorgeous, the trail mostly A+ in quality, and there were a dozen meadows/fields/balds which allowed for views and sunshine and plain old beauty.  By far this was the most beautiful section of Vermont, helped by the fantastic weather.  If most of Vermont had been like this instead of the gnarly mess of the southern 100 miles, it could easily be a favorite state for many hikers.  However, the trail was constantly rolling up and down, leaving plenty of challenge.
But there has been a significant change in my hike.  I have to stay intently focused on the placement of my feet, especially the right foot, and both knees ache (especially the right) on downhills.  The right leg issues date to the wet rock fall in NJ and won't heal until I spend some time not pounding on it.  That would be after the conclusion of the hike.  To top it off, I had another total face plant fall which bloodied the bridge of the nose, scraped the forehead, and broke my expensive reading glasses in my shirt pocket.  But opposed to the other major falls I have had when it was rainy/wet and on steep down hills (in other words largely understandable and common to most hikers), this time the trail was dry, it was excellent in quality, and it was pretty much level.  It was the third major fall I have had in the last 3 full days of hiking (all 3 falls coming off my right foot).  I seem to be losing the ability to feel the trail with my feet, especially the right one, and placement of feet is becoming very problematic.
This shelter was a welcome sight.  But is it ever mosquito infested: the worst experience so far, even with them buzzing me inside the shelter throughout the night.
Six miles to Hanover NH tomorrow.  What will my feet tell me?

My feet tonight are a mess: sore right ankle and knee; swollen feet; sores all over, a pair of which simply resist healing.  Above the ankles I feel great: strong muscles and heart/lungs, able to push long stretches of trail gaining 1000-2000' without needing to stop, all with 35 pounds on the back.
Though I enjoyed sun all this morning, showers returned later in the afternoon, continuing this wet pattern of almost daily periods of rain.  According to the TV weatherman, since May 1 Vermont has received an average of 50% more rain than normal... that about fits which I have experienced.  
As I took a long inventory this afternoon and evening, assessing my feet (with a family history of peripheral vascular disease which means poor circulation to the extremities, especially feet and legs), I have come to the conclusion that it simply is not safe enough to continue the hike.  I could take a week off, but this is highly problematic due to time and money constraints.  And in taking the time off, my problems would probably resurface on down the way and put me back in the same spot.  
So with huge reluctance, I am ending the hike.  No, I did not do 2100 miles.  But I did complete nearly 700, no small achievement for a 65-year old man.
I'm going to miss the numerous fellow hiker/friends I have met along the trail.  Thanks for hanging with me and encouraging me along the way!  Blessings on all of you, and may each of you finish your hike strong.  And thanks to you regular readers of my blog.  You have encouraged me.","Happy Hill Shelter
