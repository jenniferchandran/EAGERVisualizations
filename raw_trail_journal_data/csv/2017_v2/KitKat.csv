KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553796,"In 3 months, on Friday, April 7th, I'll get into a rental car and drive to Macon, GA. The plan is to meet my sister Nancy ..attend my brother Jim's play, ""A Drowsy Chaperone,"" then leave on Sunday with Nancy to ferry me to where I left the trail in 2015. Jim plans on retiring this year after 32 years as the founding Artistic Director of Theatre Macon and will actually be acting in this show. I thought it would be a perfect way to start this adventure. Nancy will drive me to Robbinsonville, N.C. where we'll spend two nights at the beautiful Bed and Breakfast, Appalachian Inn. We'll meet my hiking partner Nancy (Jeboots) and her husband Bob there. She and I stayed at The Appalachian Inn in 2015...it's a wonderful place. Then on Tuesday Jeboots and I will head into the Great Smokey National Park. ..where I left the trail on 6/27/2015.I will be writing this journal to my granddaughters, Ansley and Delaney...I've thought about it a lot...although I'll certainly miss my whole family...I'll miss ""my girls"" the most. Why? Because Al, Vinny, Amy, and Nick, will all understand where I am... but my precious girls will not...especially Ansley. Vinny told me tonight that Ansley named one of her Barbie Dolls ""Memaw Barbie""...nothing tugs at my heartstrings more...they are such a huge part of my life! I can't go a week without my girls ""fix."" In a sense, this will enable me to take them along on my journey...and I hope that one day this journal will inspire my girls to follow their hearts and dreams. So here goes...Dear Ansley and Delaney,To hike the Appalachian Trail started as a dream of mine but not until later in my life. Throughout my 30's, 40's and 50's I followed mini dreams...running marathons around the country...from Lake Tahoe to NYC to Grandfather Mountain. Yet I always yearned for the next adventure...the next challenge. It happened by accident...I love to read and by chance in 2013 I downloaded the book ""Wild,"" a true story about a young woman who attempts to hike the Pacific Crest trail solo in 1995. That was when it occurred to me...the Appalachian Trail's southern terminus is in Georgia...one state north of Florida...and hence my dream began.I retired from a 35 year career from the State of Florida in December 2014. My plan: hike the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, GA to Demascus, VA., a distance of about 468 miles. Over the next 6 months I bought my gear; read more AT books than I can count; planned my resupply boxes; attended a hiking clinic at the Top of Georgie Hostel; and walked miles and miles at Eagle Lake Park with a fully loaded 35lb. pack. In the end none of this fully prepared me for what the AT is.   I can tell you what it is not: it's NOT a hiking trail as we all perceive a hiking trail to be.   It's not a walk in the woods. It's rocks and roots and boulder climbs... it's ascents that never end and knee jarring descents. The trail in Georgia alone chews you up and spits you out. There's a famous tree at Neels Gap, 31 miles in, where hundreds of hikers each year call it quits and throw their boots in the tree. I get it...Three nights in, I thought ""what in the hell was I thinking?"" I equated it to running a marathon; getting to the finish line only to have to set up your tent, eat some food, crawl into your sleeping bag, get up in the morning, put on the same cold, wet, dirty clothes you wore the day before and running the marathon again. Over...and over. My Achilles heel...my feet. I learned a very valuable lesson...prevent blisters rule number one. I ended up making it to Fontana Dam...the last stretch from the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) to Fontana by myself...solo.   I know there are many who say they love hiking alone. Hiking alone is fine...you do it even when you're hiking with others due to different speeds, etc. But tenting alone... in the middle of a National Forrest, in the mountains, days away from a road...is entirely different. At Fontana Dam...mile 165, I left the trail via my trail angel...my sister Nancy ...who drove hours to pick me up when I called to tell her I needed to get off the trail...I could no longer get my battered feet in my boots... it was a heartbreaking decision but I knew that one day I'd return..as hiking the trail truly gets into your soul.Which brings us to today...I'm in the final stages of preparation for starting journey #2; I know what to expect...I know it will test my mental and physical limits; I have a great hiking partner and a loyal Trail Angel; and I know to take care of my feet.

KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553799,"Dear Ansley and Delaney,Yesterday my new 2017 AT guide arrived in the mail...actually two of them..one for me and one for Papa so he can follow me in the guide. He followed me last time and enjoyed trying to figure out how far we'd go each day. Reality is starting to sink in as is my excitement! But then today....new shoes! Went to the mall with you two and your mommy to get Delaney her first real pair of shoes and Ansley a pair of new pink and black tennies. Rode the train around the mall; rode the escalators up and down; then had to pick a 3 year old off the floor at Macy's where she had decided to lay down because she didn't want to leave...and of course I couldn't stop laughing! But then it hits me...as excited as I am to start my journey (again)...I will miss these two terribly. But in many ways I'm doing it for them...to encourage their adventurous spirits...to teach them to dare to be courageous and explore this beautiful country we live in. I hope one day to share my love of hiking with them.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sat",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553842,"Dear Ansley and DelaneyOne thing I have learned in my 61 years is to proud of your accomplishments even if you don't achieve your goals. I didn't always think this way. For my very first marathon in 1992 I picked the Grandfather Mountain Marathon in Boone, NC. Why? Because my parents had bought a summer house there and I hadn't had a chance to visit. And I wanted to run a marathon...sort of a kill two birds with one stone concept! So I trained for my very first marathon in the flatlands of Florida and decided my goal was 4 hrs 30 mins. Now keep in mind I had never been to Boone to see what real mountains look like, or had run a marathon. I finished the marathon in 4:50 and was deeply disappointed in myself... almost ashamed. I look back on that now and laugh. I should have been proud of myself for attempting and finishing something that most would never consider. I went back to the Grandfather Mountain marathon again in 2002. Being much older and wiser...and knowing what running 26.2 miles in the mountains was like...my goal was to finish...which I did with pride! So my dear girls... set goals... set them high...if you don't meet them...pick yourself up...be proud...and aim again!I fell short of my goal in 2015. But I equate it to my 1992 marathon. I attempted something that most never would. And I'm proud of that...I've picked myself up and re-aimed!",,Goals,"Jan 26, Thu",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553877,"Dear GirlsAs part of my preparation it was time to think of a Trail Name...What's a trail name you ask? Well it started in the 60's when people hiking the trail...there weren't many of them back then...started using Trail Names sort of a as GAFIA (get away from it all) concept. You leave who you are at home. On the trail you're not a teacher, student, retiree or doctor. You are your Trail Name. There are those who come from the school that they'll let the trail name them... be named by others on their hike. Then there are those who choose there own trail names. Me? I didn't want to end up as Freckle Face Strawberry, or Granny Get Goin'... and I wanted it to mean something to me personally. I always wanted it to be cat related... yes my two sisters and I are all crazy cat ladies. Although Aunt Nancy and Aunt Beth are much crazier than I... as I only have two.... Cougar and Merlin ( from Top Gun of course) They came to me via Aunt Nancy as she did feral trap, neuter and returns in her home town in NC. They were born to ferals under an abandoned building. Aunt Nancy rescued them and now they are fat and happy in Florida. So on to my Trail Name...You know how Papa loves to buy us things that aren't necessarily good for us. Well at Publix a few weeks ago he saw that KitKats (the unwrapped minis) were buy one get one... and he knows I can't resist. That night as I settled in with my glass of wine and IPad to continue my binge watch of Homeland (girls be forewarned... wine and one click buying on Amazon is a dangerous combination) I couldn't help myself... I darted to the freezer and grabbed one of the bags of KitKats. The next morning, looking at the empty bag in the garbage, I implored to Papa... STOP BUYING ME KITKATS!! And BOOM..a Trail Name was born!",,Trail Name,"Jan 28, Sat",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554266,"My precious girlsYour certainly have a fun Papa...horsey back rides, walks to the park, and pepperoni pizza delivery man. But to me... he's the reason I'm able to embark on this journey... and for that I am truly grateful. When you get older you'll understand this and you'll understand how this question would play out in most households... Honey, do you mind if I leave for a while?Where are you going?I'm going on a hike.How long will you be gone?Not sure...could be one month...could be five months.At this point, most husbands would look at their wives as if they had two heads...but not in our house. After 37 years of marriage he understands me and respects my passions. He willingly gets on board and supports me....I understand how fortunate I am. His response when I posed my question? Just promise me that you won't go alone...So while I'm gone if your Papa needs a kiss, a laugh or just some hugs...Please be there for him.I promised Papa that day that If I were ever alone that I would leave the trail. But now I have a Wingman....which is a post for another day",,Papa,"Feb 06, Mon",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556137,"Dear girls,In case you were wondering where I was last weekend, I was with my Wingman.But let me start by explaining my Wingman picture. You know I've said that Aunt Nancy is the explorer...my Trail Angel. Well Aunt Beth is the creative one...my Trail Scribe. She had this picture of Cougar and Merlin done for me which is perfect. Aunt Beth also did an incredible scrap book of my 2015 hike and will continue it for this year. I'm so fortunate to have two amazing supportive sisters.So onto my Wingman. It was by chance that I met Nancy ""Jeboots"" in 2015. Turns out she noticed on the women's hiking FB page that we had a common friend even though we had never met and live at opposite ends of Florida. Jeboots wanted to get back out on the trail so she reached out to our common friend who convinced her that we would be great hiking partners. She headed out on the trail knowing I'd be at Hawk Mountain Shelter my first night where we met. We then hiked together to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) where she had planned to get off. I continued on to Fontana Dam but we knew that one day we would continue on together. So where was I last weekend? Jeboots and I met up at the Appalachian Trail Kickoff (ATKO) at Amicalola Falls Lodge to game plan for our upcoming hike. It was a great event with vendors, speakers, trail legends...and others just like us...those who just want to go one step at a time to fulfill a dream. So when Papa made me promise that I wouldn't go alone I knew I had a Wingman....",,Wingman,"Mar 11, Sat",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557166,Dear girls... to answer your question as to why your Daddy or Papa don't join me on the trail...this pic of Violet and Apache (courtesy of Aunt Beth of course!) says it all... plus no TV or AC also presents quite the obstacle!Three weeks from tonight I'll be sleeping in a tent in the Great Smokies Mountain National Park. I hope one day to take you there...The countdown has begun!,,Not For Everyone,"Mar 21, Tue",0
KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560384,"Dear girlsSo sorry for the delay in posting but between no service and being in my sleeping bag at 7pm, I just really now had a chance! We have truly been blessed with beautiful weather so far, because the week before we left a snowstorm hit the Smokies that stranded many hikers. As I said...timing is everything! I won't bore you with every detail such as what time we broke camp or whether or not a climb has switchbacks, so this will be a journal of highlights! We are right now in Gatlinburg having been ferried here by our trail angel Aunt Nancy. She picked us up yesterday at Clingmans Dome and we slackpacked today to Newfound Gap which provided two lovely short days! Day one, Tuesday 4/11, we left Fontana Dam and headed into the Smokies. We planned on a short day and tented at Birch Spring Gap. It was a glorious hiking day. Day two took us to Russell Field Shelter. In the Smokies you have to stay in the shelters unless they're full...only then can you tent. Day three was the hardest so far. The climb up to Rocky Top was steep and grueling...but the view was amazing. That night we stayed at Derrick Knob Shelter which also had a very steep climb to get to it which made for a really tough day. Day four took us to Double Spring Gap Shelter. It was not a bad day as far as climbing goes and when we got to the shelter it was full so we were happy to be able to tent! Day five was a short relatively easy hike to Clingmans Dome where Aunt Nancy picked us up...was so looking forward to my first shower in five days...and oh yes...a burger and a beer! Having hiked to Newfound Gap today, Aunt Nancy will drop us off there tomorrow where we'll head into the northern section of the Smokies...rain is expected along with cooler temps...I'll update when I can.","Fontana Dam

KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561612,"My precious girlsWhat a hike it was through the northern part of the Smokies! From Newfound Gap our destination was Pecks Corner Shelter, a little over 10 miles...there were many tough climbs and open ridge walking...then we got caught in a wild hail storm! We were pelted with rain and hail for about an hour until we finally made it to the shelter...drenched and cold! The next day was a very short day to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter due to weather...because of the rules in the Smokies about staying in shelters everyone was jockeying to get a space because of the non stop rain. The Smokies became a chess match to try to secure shelter space. No one likes setting up a tent in the pouring rain and packing up a drenched tent the next day. Our last night in the Smokies was at Cosby Knob Shelter which was packed. The following day we made it to Standing Bear Farm Hostel which was an experience unto itself! This Florida girl needs a dose of sunshine!","Newfound Gap

KitKat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561847,"My dear Ansley and DelaneyOur stay at Standing Bear Farm was quite the experience...it's a very bohemian, bare bones hostel...but the people were so nice and accommodating. We decided to slackpack from Brown Gap back to Standing Bear, about a 10 mile hike over Snowbird Mountain. Maria, the owner shuttled us there, and we were lucky to have decent weather, and even some sun, till we got over Snowbird, and then the rain followed us the rest of the way in. The next day we were dropped back off at Brown Gap and we crossed Max Patch before the skies opened up again. Max Patch was beautiful and the views were amazing! That night we stayed at Roaring Fork Shelter. Since we had no cell service we had no weather report when we headed out on Sunday, although it had rained most of the night. Not far into the day the weather deteriorated to pounding rain, sleet and high winds. We ended up crossing both Walnut Mountain and Bluff Mountain in the horrendous weather in order to get to lower elevation to set up our tents. On Monday we packed up our wet gear for a 9 mile hike into Hot Springs for some much needed r & r!","Standing Bear Farm Hostel
