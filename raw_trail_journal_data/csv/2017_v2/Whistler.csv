Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550585,"So, I've been thinking for some time about setting up my trail journal, but kept thinking it was too soon. Well, ""too soon"" is quickly passing by. There's never a day that goes by that I don't think about my hike, my dream, my privilege. I'm so blessed to have good health and strong support from Ann Marie whose encouragement drives me toward my ultimate goal...Mt. Katahdin.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551809,"I wake each morning and my first thoughts are all about ""my hike"". I think about the solitude, the adventure, sites, people I'll meet and of course, the loneliness. The time leading up to this grand adventure has also kept me busy with my physical preparation. An exercise regiment (primarily upper body) and diet (12 lbs down) is all about preparing for this hike. Placing check marks in the positive column so as to hopefully and proactively avoid those hike ending situations. Equipment is obviously front and center with regards to planning and preparation. I feel pretty confident in my selection and choices. Those who know me, know that I make it a habit to research my purchase decisions to death. My old equipment was just that...old; old, outdated, and heavy (yet still very functional). Having hiked with my sons, it was all geared toward multiple persons, not a sole hiker. New one person tent (REI quarter dome 1) check, new backpack (Osprey 58) check...and so on. All newer, modern and most importantly...lighter.",,Mount Katahdin,"Nov 26, Sat",0
Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553336,"Living in Nova Scotia,Canada and planning an AT thru hike has presented me with a couple of logistical ""opportunities"". Communications being a major concern and bringing with it a high level of frustration. My Canadian cell phone provider (Bell Aliant) believes it is their right to require you to offer your first born for the privilege of their services. Being that my first born is now 34 years old, I realized I had to come up with another solution. Enter my dear sister and brother-in-law with a brilliant idea to put me on their plan.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554125,"Funny how you can start second guessing all your prior research and decisions. With so much information out there, you can start to go a bit crazy. How the first thru-hikers ever succeeded is a mystery to me. You would obviously want to have all the ""plus boxes"" checked and do all you can to avoid those potential negatives. The problem is that if you research enough you find conflicting information/suggestions. Mail drops happens to be the most confusing issue for me. Different schools of thought exist out there...everything from ""not sweating it"" as it will ""work itself out"" to advance food drops along the entire AT and everything in-between.    I am leaning more toward resupplying as I go. Understanding there will be a few exceptions and keeping in mind those areas where resupply has been documented as difficult and/or nearly impossible. The fact that my home is in Nova Scotia makes resupply support from my wife impractical. Having family in the States is a major plus and I will need their support for those limited food drop shipments.",,Mount Katahdin,"Feb 04, Sat",0

""Hear the Challenge: Hike the Appalachian Trail"" by Kyle Rohrig is by far the most comprehensive book on the AT I have read. Recently published (Jan. 6th, 2017) and available through Amazon, this book covers it all and answers just about every question you might have. Subjects covered include: Preparing your life for a thru-hike; Financial Prep; Mental Prep; Physical Prep; Hiking with a dog (Kyle did); Insights and information into nearly every aspect of thru-hiking; and so much more.

I try to not be a burden on my family, especially since both our sons have young families and are obviously all very busy with their lives. Well, I found out just how blessed I am. Lauren (Richard's wife) took charge and booked a cabin close to Amicalola State Park for Ann Marie, myself, Richard, Lauren and my granddaughters. My other son (Brian) and his wife Sarah live another couple hours further away and again I didn't want to burden them. They have their two boys, ages two and three months and Sarah has just returned to work after her three months maternity leave.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554590,"Those of you with small children and those of us blessed with grandchildren know how wonderful and fun it is when they start talking. You tend to find ways to incorporate their cute sayings into your everyday life and conversations. Katy Ellis (3 years old now) had one of those fun sayings. When she wanted you to pick her up, she would reach up to you and say ""uppa-down"". Ann Marie and I use this Katyism all the time (along with the rest of the Katy Ellis/Webster dictionary). So, when it came time for me to throw my pack on for hiking workouts, I told Annie that I was going to do my ""uppa-downs"". Too much snow outside? Not a problem...""uppa-downs"" can be done anywhere there is a flight of stairs. Boring? Yes! Effective? Yes!!!  Speaking of snow, there is nothing better for a upper body workout than shoveling the white stuff. With less than three weeks to go...gotta get ready.

Three blizzards in a eight day period with close to 3 feet of the white stuff and drifts up to 6 and 8 feet...crazy! The good news, outside the obvious upper body workouts with literally hours of shoveling, is that the snowshoeing is great. My only regret is that I didn't bring my pack which would have made for a killer workout.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554826,Annie and I were invited over to our dear neighbours' home last night for a drink and some hors d'oeuvres. I was truly surprised when they handed me a card and small gift wrapped box. The card was beautiful and the gift left me speechless. Sarah and Donald presented me with a Saint Christopher medal. Saint Christopher is the Patron Saint of travelers and someone I welcome to watch over me on my journey. Donald is a retired (although he remains very active) ordained Anglican priest. Father Donald proceeded to bless my new gift which I will keep close by on my thru-hike. I won't be wearing any jewelry on my hike so Saint Christopher will come along attached to my backpack wallet.    Whistler,,Mount Katahdin,"Feb 19, Sun",0

From there, we fly out of Halifax for time with our sons and their families. And then it's off to Springer on March 5th. Recently, it's been difficult to function as all I think about is the gift I am about to receive. The loose ends that weigh heavily on all of us are slowly but surely being completed. For example, as a duel citizen of the US and Canada, filing for our 2016 taxes was one of those urgent and important concerns.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555066,"Last night marked my last meeting with our local board of trade. I have had the privilege to actively support the Annapolis Board of Trade for the past eight years while most recently serving two terms as their vice president. Many thanks to ABoT's council for their dedication to its mandate of economic development and for its support of the business community and membership. My sincere appreciation for their well wishes as I prepare for my thru-hike and especially the thoughtful parting gifts (one of which was enjoyed last night and is pictured here...Awesome!).  So, as all thru-hikers (and all us wannabe thru-hikers) know, we find ourselves bringing closure and finality to our ""real world"" responsibilities. We understand that we have commitments and obligations while we simultaneously prepare to take on a completely selfish task. We will call on our spouse, friends, and family to ""carry the load"" for us while we carry our packs and our dreams on our backs. We are truly blessed...Whistler",,Mount Katahdin,"Feb 24, Fri",0
Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555080,"The only jewelry I ever wear (and have never taken off) is the gold chain Annie gave me for my 30th birthday and of course, my wedding ring. It's expected that most thru-hikers will lose a substantial amount of weight and I couldn't bare the thought of my wedding ring falling off me and consequently losing it somewhere between Georgia and Maine.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555571,"What a blessing this weekend has been. I'm so appreciative for my family seeing me off on my thru-hike. We spent the weekend together enjoying the great food (and drink), beautiful views, and especially each other's company. We rented a beautiful cabin (well done Lauren) that was just an hour drive to Amicalola Falls. We woke up early, had a big breakfast, drove out to get me registered, and then walked the steps down/up the falls. We also drove out to Woody Gap to lay some trail magic on those that got a head start on me. My next posting will be with some actual miles in the plus column.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555674,"Day 1: We arrived at Springer Mountain at around 10:30 AM and took the .9 mile hike up for pictures and for me to sign the registration book. After this precious time together we hiked back to our cars and after a prayer for safe travel (thank you Richard) everyone but Annie took off for their homes. Annie hiked north with me for about a half mile where we sat and had lunch together. After lunch it was time for me to put some miles down. Having to say goodbye to my beautiful bride made for what I know would be my most difficult day of this journey.  I did make some great time today as I hiked till 6:00. I found the perfect stealth campsite at the top of Sassafras Mountain (3300 feet). That put my first day mileage at 11.5. Not too bad considering the late start.  I fixed a simple dinner and washed it down with a beer that found its way into my pack. Thanks for that Richard, it was well worth the 12 oz. of added weight. Whistler","Springer Mountain

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555721,"Day 2: After an early dinner last night and in my sleeping bag by 8:30, I was up at 4:00, packed up and hiking with light rain by 6:00. I met ""Captain Handy"" (retired Florida Highway Patrol) just before Justus Creek. We hiked together until Gooch Mountain Shelter where I had my second breakfast and coffee. We split up, but leapfrogged all day. I made it to Woody Gap by 11:15 and had an early lunch. I got into Slaughter Creek Trail at 4:15 and am calling it a day, a respectable 17 miles today. I found a great creek which was perfect for soaking my dogs... they be some tired.   Back to my early morning start...it was pitch dark so I had to use my headlamp. I did take one wrong turn, but quickly got myself reoriented.  So, about my new best friends... those that have hiked with me know I have always used a hiking staff. I thought I would use trekking poles on this trip and boy was that the right decision. I've saved myself from several falls for certain. But just as important, is the reduction of stress on your legs, especially your knees. Walking with trekking poles requires deliberate and purposeful movements. On flat surfaces (not too many flats on the AT) you actually push off through your steps. On the uphill climbs you are pushing down using your upper body. The use on descents are helped with the stability and carrying some of the load... almost like having four legs. So, trekking poles are my new best friends. Whistler","Sassafras Mountain

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555823,"Day 3: Today started a bit later than what I had hoped. I woke at 2:30 and thought I would never get back to sleep. The next thing I knew it was 5:30; I broke camp, had breakfast, and was hiking by 7:00. The weather has been awful today with rain and fog all day. I can't remember the last time I've been so wet. I climbed Blood Mountain by 8:00 and snapped one of my trekking sticks on the way up. So yesterday I shared via my journal how my trekking sticks were my new best friends and this morning I had some pretty strong words for them. Fortunately, Mountain Crossing Outfitters was just a few miles off. They were very sympathetic and very happy to sell me some new best friends.  Believe it or not, sometimes you actually have to think while hiking. There are decisions do need to be made... like do I have peanut butter or tuna on a pita? Should I get water at this creek or the next one? Well today I had to decide if I should continue to hike in the rain or call it quits. It's 5:30 and I've already had dinner and am tucked in my bag. It's cold and wet out there with a big storm on the way this evening. Let's see how this REI quarter dome holds up. All the best, Whistler (Never had a bad day....)","Slaughter Creek Trail.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555915,"Day 4: I woke up this morning at 4:30, crazy hungry. So, I decided it was time to get my day going. I thought I'd solve the hunger issue first so I grabbed my headlamp and stepped out of my fine accommodations for my food bag which was hanging on a bear cable. I pulled out a pop tart (frosted strawberry ... a superb pastry) and thought to myself that it was way too cold and way to windy to hike in the dark. So, I put my head down on my inflatable pillow (,my best investment) and slept till 6:30. I jumped up packed up, and was hiking by 7:00. Weather was crazy cold but beautiful and sunny. I made it to Low Gap shelter at 10:15 and had the place to myself. Second breakfast/early lunch consisted of flat bread and peanut butter with coffee (heaven on earth). My plan was to finish up at Blue Mountain shelter but I got there way too early and decided to hike on (gotta make hay while the sun shines). I decided I'd head to Blue Mountain camp which is just another.9 miles. Not sure how, but I missed it by .6 miles... hikers never go backwards if they can avoid it so I hiked on to Unicoi Gap (another 1.5 mile). When I got to Unicoi, Ga. Hwy 75, ""Bunn"" was there waiting on a shuttle. So off to the Hiawassee Budget Inn to split a $45 room, hot shower, and a Subway sandwich for dinner (we didn't share the sub or the shower... just the cost of the room). Right place, right time... A random thought... the AT crosses a highway every few days or so. You can hear the cars and trucks long before you exit the woods. I've noticed how excited I get while still deep in the woods when I can hear those passing vehicles. I'm not really sure why I get so excited, but I think it's all about still being somewhat connected to the real world. As I hike on, the traffic noise fades and I get excited. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because I get to disconnect from the real world.","Whitley Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 08, Wed",14.50
Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555997,"The Budget Inn was exactly what you would expect for $45... but, it had a real bed with clean sheets (I convinced myself that the sheets were clean, Bunn slept in his sleeping bag). I woke up at 5:00 and did some house keeping. Dragged my pack into the bathroom so as to not disturb ""Bunn"". First on the to do list was to fix my rain pants. They kept falling off me so I had to rig the elastic to stay cinched. Next on the to do list... when I first woke up I felt some pain on my small toe. Upon closer inspection I discovered that someone took my toe and replaced it with another unfamiliar toe (invasion of the toe snatchers?). This toe was obviously not mine as it was completely out of proportion. After all, I've had that toe for 57 years and can tell the difference. I decided the best course of action was to stick it with my knife. Once I did this it seemed to deflate and turned into my toe again. I wrapped that piggy in medical tape and was ready to roll.  Fast forward...the shuttle took me back to Unicoi Gap at 9:30 which gave me a late start, but such is life on the trail.  As I hiked along I met ""Tin Man"". I obviously asked why the trail name ""Tin Man""? To which he replied that he is on a celebratory hike. You see, ""Tin Man"" had/has a heart condition and was actually seeing a heart transplant specialist when he made a recovery that doctors still can't explain. I'll come back to the ""Tin Man"" in a bit. Fast forward to when that impostor of a little toe starts acting up again. The little fellow next to him started some nonsense too so I took my boot and sock off and stabbed him with my knife... really, I did. Wrapped both those suckers in medical tape, put my sock and boot back on and started hiking... hiking real slow. Re-enter ""Tin Man"", yep the guy with the bad heart, pacemaker, and oh yeah, a defibrillator surgically placed in his chest. He was cranking along while I was all worked up over a couple of stupid blisters. Well, I decided to let Mr. Pacemaker set the pace. We cranked out some fast miles. I finally told ""Tin Man"" that I couldn't keep up and to go on ahead. That's when he let me know what he does for a living... personal trainer. Anyway, I caught up with him a bit later and we are camping on top of Kelly Knob tonight. Thank you ""Tin Man"" for helping me put perspective on my hike. Whistler","Unicoi Gap

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556066,"Day 6: That's one state down... thirteen to go...While on top of Kelly Knob last night, we experienced a huge thunder and lightning storm. There we were (""Tin Man "" and myself) in the most glorious of places and on a 4,000 foot mountain when all heck broke loose around 10:00. Not the smartest place to be, but it was quite the pyrotechnics show though.  We packed our wet and muddy tents along with the rest of our gear when things calmed down at around 8:00 making for another unavoidable late start. I stopped at Deep Gap shelter and had breakfast. Our primary goal was to get to Dick's Creek Gap for trail magic. We arrived and had hot dogs, bacon and eggs, soda, cookies, apples, snickers, moon pies, and orange juice. Thank you ""Bigfoot"" and ""Greeter""...it was awesome!!! ""Bigfoot"" thru hiked either last year or possibly the year prior. He has a true passion for the hiking community and really believes in supporting it. He would tell you that it is his way of giving back. Way to humble!!! He also has a great series of YouTube videos that are instructive and helpful if you are planning a thru hike. You can also follow him at followbigfoot.com. ""Greeter"" will be starting his flip/flop thru hike in two weeks.  On to business... We cranked out 13.4 miles today and are set up at Bly Gap NORTH CAROLINA!!! My feet held up great, tummy is full, camp set, and sleeping bag's waiting for me. Before I end tonight's posting, I wanted to give my sincere thanks to all those that have signed my guest book (tab to the left of this page). It means so much to hear from family, friends, and strangers as they follow my personal journey.  Special thanks to all the trail angels that provide acts of kindness.  The biggest call out to those volunteers that give selflessly of their time, talents, and sweat to maintain the trail so that we can enjoy their gift. And now in closing, a poem...When does a walk become a hike?What satisfies, defines our like?The tromping, the climbing?The tripping, the declining?The pains, the distance?The rains and resistance?Or, is it the release we feelAs our souls do heal?Our steps are not simply randomBut placed in faith and in perfect tandem.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556131,"Day 7: A contrast of black and white The ""TinMan"" and I left Bly Gap by 7:45 this morning. A very cold morning that is. In fact, I don't believe it ever got above freezing. The climb out was insane at what seemed like a nearly vertical ascent. We ended up separated with a plan to meet for lunch at Standing Indian shelter, but ""Tin Man"" missed the side trail to Standing Indian and kept going. We ended up meeting at Carter Gap Shelter this evening.  So, about today... because I hiked almost all day by myself I had time to think and take in what was going on around me. Let's just say it wasn't pretty. The section of the AT hiked today is the section that had been devastated by the fires last year. There is really no way to describe the destruction I witnessed. It was, quite honestly, difficult to walk through and somewhat depressing. To go from one day of absolute beauty to the next day seeing pure devastation was a huge contrast.  This contradiction was made even more evident when it started to snow. It almost looked like ashes from the fire were floating back to the scene of the inferno. The deeply blackened and charred forest with the heavy white snow was a true contrast of black and white.  Whistler","Bly Gap

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556276,"Day8: This morning started out with freezing temperatures and three inches of snow. It was extremely difficult to motivate myself to creep out of my sleeping bag. To top it off, the clocks were moved forward one hour.  Well, I finally got it moving... two maple cinnamon oatmeal packets with dehydrated apples and a cup of coffee for breakfast. When I finally broke camp which included knocking as much snow and ice off of everything as I could, it was 10 minutes before 9:00. I guess the good Lord decided to rectify the issue of the scorched forest I journaled about yesterday by covering it with a blanket of snow. It was beautiful.  As the day went on and temperatures climbed, snow clods started falling on my head and backpack. It did start getting old after the countless times it occurred. I know come June I'd love to have that snow dropped on me... why is it that we are never satisfied?  So I hiked mostly solo today which gave me time to think about something. I hit the 100 mile plus mark today and I thought how if God were waiting at that 100 mile mark and told me I was done, no more hiking for Whistler, I don't think I could bear such a thing as to not be able to finish. Every mile I get to hike is precious to me and I thank God for that privilege. Okay, a suggestion for future thru-hikers with regards to today's hike...when you get to Albert Mountain, fold up those trekking poles, stash them in your pack and be ready for a rock scramble. It was especially tough going today with the snow and ice. I recommend three points of contact on that very steep climb. Now, time for another hiker tip if you are planning a thru- hike regarding sleeping bag choice; if you think you can get by with a three season sleeping bag... forget it. The number one complaint I've heard on my hike is how cold it is and how hard it is to get good sleep. I've slept threes nights in a row in snow, freezing rain, and thunder storms. I've always been comfortable and warm. Watch your pack weight somewhere else. All the best, Whistler.","Carter Gap Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556285,"Day 9: Another freezing cold night...but I was warm in my four season duck down bag! My biggest problem is breaking down camp. There is so much snow and ice that it's difficult to get it off the tent. I end up packing it and carrying the extra weight. In fact, I was having to shake it off tonight while setting up again.  There was so much ice on the trail this morning that it made for dangerous hiking conditions. With every step, I think to myself that a slip could be a hike ended. The trail tends to be only 18 to 24 inches wide in areas. There are places where you hug the mountain side because 18 inches away is a drop to nothingness. Still, I was able to clock another 16.7 miles today, not too bad considering the rough conditions.  I'm heading to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) for a package pick up from my trail angel sister. I'm going to make it a ""Nero"" (A ""Nero"" is a day with few miles. A ""zero"" is a day taken off hiking with no miles). A real bed and I might even throw in a shower (or two) and laundry as well.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556370,"Day 10: So, here I am enjoying a glass of red wine (thanks to my dear trail angel, Susan, and her drop box full of surprises) thinking about today's events. Actually, I'll need to back up a day. So, yesterday afternoon ""Fish"" and ""Radio "" came up behind me doing their normal quick hiking pace. They told me about some bad weather coming. Apparently, freezing rain, snow, and high winds were expected. I'd already spent the last two nights in similar weather while everyone else ran off to Franklin. My thought was that the tough weather would prepare me for the ""Whites"" of New Hampshire. Well, to be honest, I was tired of waking up each morning and packing a frozen tent. I decided I would make a run for Cold Spring Shelter six miles further up the trail and gain one of the six shelter spots for myself. I gotta tell you that I was hoofing it. Imagine my disappointment when I arrived and found 8 people in a shelter designed for 6. It was still early (4:00) and I still had some steam in my legs so I decided to do a couple more miles. My goal was to get to Rocky Bald. I arrived at 5:00 and couldn't believe the view. At 5,030 feet I had the most spectacular vistas. With the weather still clear, I made camp, had dinner, hung my food bag, journaled and went to bed. Right at midnight I woke to the storm and just rolled over and went back to sleep. When I awoke again at 5:30 I could see my tent was heavy with snow. Generally, this would not be a problem, but Rocky Bald is up a rock face that on a good day requires careful negotiation. My concern was that the blazes were painted on the rock face, covered in snow, that I'd be unable to find them, and that I'd have a difficult/slippery time trying to get back to the trail. After getting breakfast and packing my pack (including a frozen tent) I made my way. I ended up using my trekking poles as canes, not risking putting my wrists through the straps for fear of slipping/sliding down the rock face of Rocky Bald. I made it safely to the trail only to find that I was obviously the first one hitting the trail... no track in the virgin snow but mine and a countless number of animals (those animals must find the AT convenient... a forest super highway). I made the 9.9 miles to the NOC in exactly four hours... mostly descending. In fact, the descent went from 5,030 feet to 1,732 feet over the 9.9 miles. Ice and snow made it a real challenge and had me slip and fall three times. I kept my speed up as I factored in the soft snow and the toque on my head to limit the impact and a concussion if my head hit a rock. So, I made it safely to the NOC, had a big fat hamburger, fries and two of the best beers I've ever drunk. I'm showered and laundry is done... life is good... nope, life is great! A note to my family, friends, and those followers of my journal... my intent is to journal every day. Sometimes I find I'm in a location that has limited or no cell service or my battery has run down. When this happens I will make up the entry when I have service/power. Whistler","Rocky Bald

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556477,"Day 11: Spending the night at the NOC was a great move (more luck on my part than anything). I woke up at 6:00 revived and raring to go. I stayed in my room all afternoon and evening the day before to get my gear, clothes, and myself cleaned up. My plan was to get a big breakfast at River's End Restaurant at the NOC. I saw a huge group of 20 plus inside which turned out to be a group preparing for a river paddle (and you thought I was crazy). Anyway, they were having breakfast off a big buffet so I asked a gentleman that apparently was the manager if I might be able to order breakfast? He apologized and informed me of their hours (11:00-7:00), but with his next breath tells me to grab a plate and help myself from the group's buffet. Life is freaking AWESOME!!! Good karma on Mr. NOC restaurant manager?? The hike out of Bryce/NOC was straight up. It snowed so much last night that it was up over my knees in places. When I arrived at Sassafras Gap shelter which was just 6.4 miles, I had lunch and decided that it would have been irresponsible and dangerous to continue. A very short day, but at 24 degrees I feel I have made a good decision. Anyway, I've got a full food bag, all my layers on and a group of fellow hikers (including an ATC ridge runner) to chew the fat with. It is supposed to warm up some tomorrow so I'll make up the miles then. In the meantime, I'm safe and above freezing. Whistler","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556700,"Day 12: Oh, what a night...It was a very long and cold night for the inhabitants of Sassafras Gap Shelter. As I explained in yesterday's post, freezing temperatures forced us to stay put. In fact, it got down to 9 degrees Fahrenheit... I figured I would have been warmer if I slept in my freezer at home...crazy cold. It was so cold that our isobutane stoves wouldn't light unless we warmed the canisters underneath our clothes. While hiking to Sassafras, my hydration system was freezing as I hiked. I would have to warm the hose and bite valve with my hands to thaw them whenever I needed a drink. The shelter was big enough to sleep 14, but there were only six of us (nobody else was crazy enough to be out in that weather). Everyone was inside their sleeping bags by 1:00 in the afternoon. I had every piece of clothing I have with me on my body. At midnight I needed to visit the ""privy"". My boots were frozen solid. I slept with my hydration bladder and my water filter in my sleeping bag to keep them from freezing. This morning, all anyone wanted to do was to get hiking as that was the only way to stay warm. Fortunately the day's temperatures were fantastic, in the 40's and clear skies... praise the Lord. It was slow going as there were snow and ice which made hiking difficult and dangerous. I slipped and fell three times and this with using extreme caution. Truth be told, it is possible that I passed some of the most spectacular views today and never knew it. I was too busy looking at my feet and deciding where to put them to keep myself from falling. Much more important than to even begin to think about looking around me. So, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention ""Jacobs Ladder"". This climb was the most difficult so far. This was not a religious experience, but there were a lot of hikers, myself included using the Lord's name in vain. There was no ladder here, nor stairs, elevator or escalator either. In fact, not even any switchbacks to speak of. This was a vertical climb that just beats you up and is unforgiving. Future hikers, shorten your trekking poles and get ready...Right at the noon hour, ""Bottles"", ""Carl"" and myself met down at Stecoah Gap at NC 143, had lunch at a picnic table, and decided to continue on to Cable Gap Shelter for a 15.2 mile day. This puts Fontana Dam just over six miles away and perfect for my next resupply (thank you Lauren). From there I enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As I write this entry to my journal, I have no phone or data service so it will get posted a day late. It's just before 8:00 PM, I'm in my tent (overfull shelter) in my sleeping bag and ready to pass out. But first a call out to the best sister a brother could ever ask for. Her hiker drop box was waiting for me at the NOC. Homemade hot chocolate, homemade backpackers macaroni and cheese, and countless other goodies got me through a really tough two days. Thank you Susan... I love you!!!Whistler","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556701,"Day 13:I got an early start today (7:45) as I wanted to get to Fontana Dam as early as possible. I had my drop box to pick up, Smoky National Park permit to print, a real meal to eat?? and some fuel and batteries to locate/purchase. My goal was to hike the 12 miles past Fontana Shelter (called the Fontana Hilton), but the hours just slipped by. The park rule is that you must stay at their shelters (no stealth camping allowed). I would have been too late getting in, so, another ""Nero"". About this morning's hike... ice everywhere; I did everything I could to not slip, but still took three big slip and slides. Each time I'd get back up and look around to make sure no one saw me (like who is out there to see me?). I'd take full inventory to make sure I was still whole and then, as my granddaughter says after a fall, I'd say to myself, ""I'm OK"", (only she yells it out). FYI, apparently there is no cell service in the Smokies. It might be several days before I can post again. An easy day today and big miles to make up. All the best,Whistler","Cable Gap Shelter
",Fontana Hilton Shelter,"Mar 17, Fri",6.70
Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556843,"Day 14: Staying at the Fontana Hilton last night ended up being a good decision. A heavy rain and fog dropped by to pay us a visit. It rained all night which put me a little behind my self imposed goal of a 7:00 AM departure. I had really wanted to get my first twenty mile day, but had to settle for 17.6. I was walking across the Fontana Dam at 7:45 and was in awe by its enormity and by the engineering wonder of the structure. I was quite amused by a sign posted which read, ""NO JUMPING OR DIVING"". Really? Did they really have to post a sign?  Views were limited for most of the day as that smoke/fog hung heavy. That was okay though because once again I was too busy looking at my feet. What do you get when on one day you have a foot of snow and the next day a rain storm with temperatures in the 50's? You get mud that is the consistency of lard. Lots of slip sliding, but fortunately no falls today.  While hiking in the Smoky Mountains National Park, you are required to stay at the shelters. The only way you can tent camp is if the shelter is full. In other words, you plan your entire day based on the distance you can hike to the next shelter. No stealth camping can cramp your style.  I'm at Spence Field Shelter tonight which is packed (with a lot of people not very concerned about my desire to get rest). A couple more days and I'll be out of the park with a bit more freedom. Don't get me wrong, the Smokies are beautiful and the shelters are beautiful (stacked stone and timber construction). They are just a bit too constricting.","Fontana Hilton Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556935,"Day 15: I would have been found innocent of my crime by the court of Spence Field Shelter had I followed up on my desire to put an end to one of my shelter mate's snoring. Let's call him ""Simpson"" (he and his family reside in Simpsonville, South Carolina). He and I struck up a conversation because of his Gamecock hat, a very nice guy for sure. ""Simpson"" was just preparing to finish his section hike and shared his love for the AT. When hiker midnight struck (about 8:00), everyone was getting settled. ""Simpson"" must have been real tired as he quickly fell asleep.  My imagination kicked into high gear when it became apparent that it was going to be a long and sleepless night. My first thought was that I could smother ""Simpson"" with his Sea to Summit blow up pillow. I imagined the other 12-15 Shelter residents jumping up and applauding my actions. Court would have been held in the morning over our oatmeal, Pop Tarts, and instant coffee. I would have been found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity and allowed to continue my hiking.  My next thought was that I would hike back to Fontana Dam and locate the sign I journaled about yesterday. You know the one, ""No jumping or Diving"", and jump. That sign makes sense to me now... Today's hike was treacherous with ice along the trail in the morning after freezing temperatures overnight. By mid afternoon the sun had worked its magic and turned the trail into a lard and quicksand mixture. It was very slow going (no slip and falls for Whistler today, whew!). Anyway, I'm just a couple of miles from Clingmans Dome. At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome is the highest peak on the AT and Smoky Mountains National Park, as well, the second highest east of the Mississippi. I am hoping for a clear morning and some beautiful views.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557067,"Day 16: Hiking each day for eight to nine hours is almost like having a job. You wake up early, get dressed, take care of ""personal"" stuff, eat breakfast, pack your stuff and walk to work. You'll get a lunch break, stop walking when your shift is over, eat dinner, get ready for bed, sleep, wake up... repeat. It's my job... it's what I/we do. Today's hike took me to the prized summit of Clingmans Dome. It was a beautiful morning with clear skies (although it clouded a bit just as I arrived). The observation tower seemed a bit out of place, but I had to remind myself that it was built for the multitudes. The views are just out of this world. It's no wonder that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited park in the United States.  The descent from Clingmans Dome was horrifying. The ice on the backside of this mountain was heavy and difficult to negotiate. I slipped and fell three times.  The rest of the day's hike was a pleasure with the trail taking me through beautiful lush forest of Fraser fir and red spruce. It amazed me how much the forest changed with the changes in elevation.  I haven't mentioned a young man I had been leapfrogging these past few days. His name is Quinn and he had been going by the trail name, ""The Mighty Quinn"", which he didn't care for very much and was hoping for a new one. Well, Quinn would start his day long after me and inevitably pass me before lunch. So I offered up the new trail name, ""Wheels"", which he loved. Unfortunately, ""Wheels"" took a shuttle in to Gatlinburg today and is off the trail. Some personal reasons which is a shame as he is a great young man and a really strong hiker, perhaps another season for ""Wheels"".  A highlight of the day was when I arrived at Newfound Gap, US 441. The parking lot was packed and was actually a bit of a shock after the isolation of the trail. I was standing with a group of thru-hikers when a woman walked up to me and said, ""You look like you could use a beer"". Did it show that much? Was it that obvious? Anyway, thank you Trail Angel Heather... you made a great day greater!!! Today I hiked with ""Hook-set"", ""Strider"", and ""Ho Chi Minh"", all great guys about my age and hiking speed.  Tomorrow's weather is calling for rain (""No rain-no Maine"").

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557239,"Day 17: I'm a light sleeper, but really?I was in my sleeping bag by 8:00 last night in anticipation of a good night's sleep. I had a pretty good idea that it might not go well when ""Tank"" made a public announcement that he has sleep apnea and that it's a disability and we all need to suck it up. He went on to say that if anyone touched him to try to stop his snoring he would kick them in the face (ouch). Hmmm, how do you even begin to respond to that? Well, unfortunately ""Tank"" wasn't the only one snoring; it sounded like a herd of wild animals in that shelter. I tried everything I could to get to sleep... forget earplugs as they were totally ineffective. It was 4:30 in the morning when I gave up. I got myself dressed, ate breakfast, and packed my backpack. I was hiking by headlamp by 6:00. I slipped hard on an ice patch, hurt my hip when I landed, and bent a trekking pole. The problem being that I was exhausted, I mean walking zombie exhausted. I finally made my way to Pecks Corner Shelter where a volunteer, ""Ox"", was doing shelter maintenance. I explained my situation of having gone sleepless. I asked him that after I had lunch if I could get a one hour nap. ""Ox"" took care of me... he did some work away from the shelter and gave me my wake up call at 12:00. After waking I felt much better and hiked an additional 5 miles to Tri Corner Knob Shelter where I set up my tent. 'Ranger Bob' could come by and site me with a fine and I'd gladly pay it. I'm not sleeping in a shelter again. FYI, the weather reports called for rain all day... never happened!!! In fact, it was probably the best weather I've had thus far. So, I had something happen to me a while back that I've given a lot of thought to.  It was at Levelland Mountain that I came up behind an older couple along with who I thought must be their granddaughter. They were moving quite slowly when they made an abrupt stop and announced, ""This is a good place for lunch"". I went around them and wished them a good day. As I walked away I thought to myself that they would never make it. Five miles later I was ready to drop for being so tired and hiked into Whitley Gap Shelter. The next morning I was hiking along for several miles when I came across them again. They were eating breakfast and we waved at each other. They actually hiked further than I had. I realized then that the trail is a true equalizer and it's impossible to know another's ability.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557324,"Day 18: After hiking with limited sleep from the night before I found my way to Tri Corner Gap Shelter. As soon as I arrived I found what had to be the only tent site there. I arrived early, but set up my tent even though the shelter wasn't full; the rule being that you must stay in the shelter unless it's full. As I journaled yesterday, I'll not stay in a shelter unless my life depends on it.  I found myself in my sleeping bag at 7:00 and soon was sound to sleep. It was around 9:30 that the light show along with accompanying thunder made a grand entrance. Funny how snoring will keep me awake all night, but how easy it was to sleep through a thunderstorm.  I was awake by 5:00, had breakfast (strawberry frosted pop tarts...yum), tent down, backpack packed, and on the trail at 6:45 (by way of my trusty headlamp). I felt superhuman this morning after a great sleep and with the benefit of a lot of down hills, made fast time of it. I did the 18.4 miles in just under seven hours.  I arrived at Standing Bear Farm in the early afternoon with the intention of a resupply and then hiking on, but fell in love with the place and decided to make their treehouse my evening accommodation. They offer hot showers (not like I needed one) and use of the laundry in with the price ($30). They also have a resupply store that easily met my needs until I get to Hot Springs. I enjoyed a great dinner of pepperoni pizza and the company of ""Hummingbird"", ""Engine and Caboose"", and ""Scoutmaster"" along with his service dog, ""Scout"".  Two highlights for today, the first being meeting four members of the Carolina Mountain Club. Just as I passed Davenport and as I exited The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, I ran into four guys doing trail maintenance. It's these fine people that have such a passion for the AT that makes this hike possible. The Carolina Mountain Club and its members maintains 93 miles of the AT. The second highlight was that I have officially completed one tenth of the trail.","Tri Corner Gap Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557377,"Day 19:I went to bed last night at 8:00 to the sound of a babbling brook directly below my tree house bunk.  10 hours later I jumped out of bed when I saw it was already 6:00. It was time to get ready for work. By the time I had everything packed, breakfast and coffee, and my bill paid, it was 8:30. My plan was to do between 12 and 15 miles, but I felt so strong from the rest I got that I hiked exactly 20 miles. How fortuitous that the miles from Standing Bear Farm to Walnut Mountain Shelter is exactly 20 miles. So I am now officially a twenty miler. Another milestone for the day is that I have passed 250 miles hiked.  The weather very much contributed to my ability to put down those miles, as well, the elevations and terrain. So, like they say, you've gotta make hay while the sun shines.  One highlight for the day for me was hiking through Snowbird Bald. I took a picture and texted my sons as I have fond memories of the time the three of us hiked there years ago. I recalled how we sat on the Bald and picked and ate our fill of wild strawberries.  Another highlight was hiking Max Patch Bald. The 360 degree views are breathtaking. Tomorrow takes me right through the hiker friendly town of Hot Springs. When I say right through I mean literally right through. The AT goes right through the middle of their little town. More about Hot Springs tomorrow...Whistler","Standing Bear Farm

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557519,"Day 20: Today started like those before; early to rise, early to the trail. I walked away from the Walnut Mountain Shelter at 7:30 and had the 13.1 miles to Hot Springs checked off before 12:30. As soon as I left the trail and stepped on the street a car pulls up and asked if I'd like him to take my picture. He had apparently seen my attempt to take a 'selfie' with the AT and Hot Springs sign behind me. I thanked Bob and with the same breath asked him where I could get a fat hamburger. I was directed to the Smoky Mountain Diner. One huge burger, large fry and two gigantic Pepsi's later... I was shopping the Dollar General for my resupply. I ran into the local outfitter (Bluff Mountain Outfitters) for a fuel canister and power bars. I happened to notice a pub across the street and thought that would be a great place to repackage my backpack while also enjoying a cold beverage. I had originally planned to stay at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn but they were fully booked. I decided that it was too nice a day for hiking, so I didn't pursue accommodations elsewhere. I decided to make more hay.  I hadn't planned on hiking very far but it just seemed to happen. Before I knew it, I'd hiked another 7 plus miles. I guess the full belly allowed me to march on while in deep thought. As I marched on I started wondering why ""we"" hike. There are those that hike for the social aspect. I've seen so many hikers that wouldn't consider hiking by themselves. They require others around them. Perhaps that's out of a need for a sense of security, or possibly a method to help hold themselves accountable to the miles they know they have to put down.  Then there're others (myself included) that love the solitude, the peacefulness, and personal freedom that hiking alone provides. A point to ponder... there is something special about hearing a bird sing it's preassigned song. It's the familiarity and comfort that comes with knowing each bird must whistle their tune... no choice, no repertoire...it's who they are. Whistler","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557672,"Why is it so easy to talk with another thru-hiker? Day 21: 13.4 milesIt was another beautiful hiking day on the Appalachian Trail with a bit of a late start though, due to my late hiking last night. The camp site I selected was perfect. It's funny how you search for the perfect site and will hike later and further just to be certain that you found ""it"", even though all you are going to do is get in your tent and go to sleep. Perhaps it's the challenge of the hunt?  So today was a good day to stop and chat with other hikers. Sometimes you are on a mission and believe it or not, you just don't have time to talk. It might be that you need to get into town for resupply or that you know you have to lay down some miles and can't stop to talk. In any case, I found myself chatting with several people today. Some were individuals on day hikes, section hikers, and other thru-hikers. It's always so easy to talk to them. It must be because of our common interest. Day hikers and section hikers all ask the same questions. They long for the day that they themselves will take their own journey. Other thru-hikers want to know where you started that day, how many miles you will do that day, and where you plan to end your day and so on. Hikers don't talk about current events or politics. One may try, but all they get is an eye roll and left alone to talk to themselves. In fact one hiker openly reminded his wife that they agreed on no politics on the trail. No, we talk about how many calories are in what we are eating. We talk about the next water source or what the most recent weather report looks like. The 24 hour news cycle isn't front and center with a thru-hiker... trying to figure out how to consume five thousand plus calories so that you can hike another day is our priority. It's what we have in common that makes it so easy to talk with another hiker.  One final thought for the day, the story of Lou... While hiking today I thought back to a time when one of my sons and I were section hiking the AT with a dear friend. His name is Lou. Lou is one of the finest gentlemen I've ever met or have had the pleasure to know. At the time, I would have been in my late thirties or early forties while Lou was my senior by twenty plus years. He was a real strong hiker and we would struggle to keep up with him. Lou was soft spoken, kind, considerate, and someone easy to respect and admire. Well one day we had stopped hiking and Lou had walked over to where another hiker was sitting. Lou looked in the same direction as the other hiker who had remained seated and simply remarked how peaceful it was. Without skipping a beat the other hiker looked up at him and said, ""It was"". In other words, he had made it clear that Lou had interfered and interrupted his peaceful day. Lou, being the gentleman he is, gracefully stepped away. I share this story because that hiker missed out on meeting Lou. His life would have been enriched and far better off if he had stood up, introduced himself, and made time for Lou. If he had, his day would have improved tenfold. I promise, Lou would have done the same if the roles were reversed. Isn't time for making time for each other?Whistler","Stealth camped, Rich Mountain

I got dressed and walked over and pulled down my food bag from my Bear line. I fixed breakfast and started feeling rain. I quickly finished packing my pack and taking down my tent. I got my rain gear on and was hiking by 7:15. I guess I was making hay when the sun didn't shine.  ""Red Ranger"" and I had met over lunch at the Smoky Mountain Diner two days prior and ended up camping together last night. He was up shortly after me, skipped breakfast, and packed up just before the rain as well. We hiked together all day which was good to help set a pace that may not have been achieved otherwise.  An observation that I made today is the number of graves and/or memorials that there are on and along the trail. There are simple markers such as the pair of boots tied to a cross I saw yesterday to beautiful bronze plaques mounted to the face of a large boulder today. One grave that I had to walk a side trail to see is the grave of the Shelton Brothers. They were two Union soldiers who were killed on that very spot while visiting family in the Confederacy during the Civil War. This trail we walk is rich in history. I would say, ""If it could talk..."", but in a way, it does... it talks to us every day, we just need to learn to listen. Whistler","Stealth camped close to Jones Meadow

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557848,"Day 23:Speaking of listening...Another great day for hiking. Elevations were modest which made for some good miles. 20.7 in just nine hours of actual hiking. Views were spectacular on what was a mostly clear day, although we did get a quick afternoon shower. I'm still going between North Carolina and Tennessee every day. The trail is such that you literally have one foot in North Carolina while the other is in Tennessee. I will actually be entering Virginia in about another 130 miles.  So, a bit more on listening (referencing yesterday's journal posting).  There is a common saying on the trail that we thru-hikers live by. It's referred to as HYOH or hike your own hike. For example, I had a choice yesterday while hiking Big Firescald Knob of either taking the white blazed ridge trail or taking what is called a bypass/bad weather blue blaze trail. Both sections are 1.5 miles, but the white blazed trail runs the top ridge of the mountain, is very rocky, and at times requiring hand over fist climbs. The blue trail is rated ""easy"". Well, I committed to myself that I wasn't going to miss a single white blaze. While others might take the blue blaze trail, I pass zero judgment. They hike their own hike.  So, back to listening...there have been several occasions that a South bound day hiker or even a faster than me North bound thru-hiker passes me. I'll always give a big smile and greet them. I might get a return smile, but that's it. It's not until they actually pass me that I realized they have earbuds in and haven't heard a single word I said. So here I am listening to the birds, water rushing in a stream, a flock of 15-20 turkeys, two trees rubbing against each other in a stiff breeze, or just listening to the wind through the trees while they're listening to music. It may just be me, but that's not what I believe the journey is all about... on the other hand, HYOH. Whistler","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Two trees came down with a huge crack that almost had me out of my tent and into the over crowded shelter. For a shelter named No Nonsense Shelter, there was plenty of it last night.  When morning finally arrived, I made my oatmeal in my mug and had planned on making my coffee in said mug immediately following (my method of cleaning my mug...it's a hiker thing). Well, I only had enough water to fill my mug half way and the water source was two tenths of a mile back on the trail. So, I put the water in my jet boil cook stove and poured the hot liquid into my mug, used it to clean my mug and drank it... oatmeal tea... yum.  Today's hike was an easy 6.1 miles to Uncle Johnny's Hostel. When I arrived to check in I asked for my mail. It was like Christmas when they came out with three boxes. Thank you Susan, Patti, and Gordon for the treats. It's difficult to describe what it means to receive a package from friends and family.  A look behind the scenes of a thru hike; I've been dealing (with Annie's help) with REI. My hydration system which is made by Osprey has a plastic tab that allows it to be hung/suspended in my backpack (also made by Osprey). Well, this tab broke the first week I was on the trail. I also have a pair of REI rain pants that had the elastic drawstring break. Annie called to have replacements mailed to Uncle Johnny's. The person she spoke to said I would have to call since I was the customer? Okay, this would be difficult at best since I'm in the middle of NOWHERE. Then she informed Annie that I could carry the old defective ones with me and mail them back once I got home... really? Carry two pieces of failed equipment 2,000 miles? Anyway, my REI package was not here when I arrived. I attempted to call them but got disconnected three times...why? Because I'm in the middle of NOWHERE. Each time I'd call I'd get a different person. I'd have to give them my name, address, zip code, first child's name and political party affiliation (okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, they didn't ask for my zip code). We did finally determine that they mailed my package to the Erwin post office. Why would they do this when Annie gave them the hostel address remains a mystery. So now I can walk (I've been doing plenty of that lately) to the post office which is 1 plus hours away on foot or hitch a ride. Well as luck would have it, Jed, was getting ready to make a run to the dump. All I would have to do is help load the garbage. Jed being a good guy, takes me to the post office where my REI order is waiting. Funny thing being that the new hydration system is exactly the same except they redesigned the hang tab completely. Hmm, has this been a problem for others? I was going to launder those rain paints prior to mailing them back, but based on what I had to go through... some satisfaction is due to me. Hope they enjoy opening that Priority Mail envelope coming special delivery after three weeks in rain and mud and lots of Whistler sweat, from yours truly.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558083,"Day 25: I had already decided last night that I wouldn't be taking the morning shuttle offered by Uncle Johnny's to breakfast. It didn't leave until 8:30 and I had already planned to be back on the trail by then. ""Red Ranger"" also decided against the shuttle but for a different reason. He had made arrangements to hire someone to drive him to Iron Mountain Gap, twenty miles north so he could slack pack back to Uncle Johnny's. Slack packing is when you take food and water only, catch a ride and hike your way back. The benefit being the light pack and ease of the hike. The miles still count...remember, HYOH. I ran into ""Red Ranger"" at lunch time at Indian Grave Gap. He was going south and I was going north. He had hiked 12 miles and I had hiked only 8. He looked fresh and light on his feet... I looked like I needed a shower and a blood transfusion.  The hike today started at about 1,800 feet and up to just over 5,000 feet. The transitional changes in the landscape is unmistakable. The lower elevations boast mature hardwoods with mountain laurel and some conifers. Today's hike took me to a beautiful dense spruce forest at 5,000 plus feet on Unaka Mountain. The difference was remarkable in that it was so clearly delineated. The spruce forest was so dense that If you threw a stone you couldn't help but hit a tree. The forest floor was thick in seasonally shed needles which made for a soft almost carpet feel underfoot. A vast difference from the sharp rocky tread normally felt on the trail. The sun made its way through the thick canopy in beams of light that almost seemed like a Hollywood special effect. If not for the stark white blazes on the dark trunks of select trees, finding the way/trail would have been impossible. As I walked I imagined that if there were Elves, Hobbits and Fairies, surely this is where they would live. These huge majestic spruce trees stood tall over their young. The immature trees lined up in almost perfect formation and shape. It was like I was walking through a Christmas tree Farm with every one being the perfect choice to take home.  Hiker advice time...while hiking, if your bootlaces aren't feeling right, re-tie them. If there is something in your backpack rattling, take your pack off and find the culprit and stop the rattling.  If you have your clothes layered and you're hot, stop hiking, take off that layer(s) and restart your hike. In other words, if you have an itch, scratch it. It makes for a much more enjoyable hike.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558174,"Day 26: I woke early this morning and was on the trail by 7:15. I arrived at Iron Mountain Gap just prior to 7:45 and hoped to meet ""Red Ranger"" as he got dropped off. I waited a few minutes and never saw him so I hiked on.  Today was one of those days that you hike all day and practically never see another soul. I saw several day hikers and they were all southbound. No NOBO hikers at all but for myself. I stopped at Hughes Gap for lunch, ate quickly, packed up, and hiked on. Shortly after, the weather really got strange. The air got super cold and the sky turned dark. The temperature must have dropped 20 degrees in a matter of minutes. Here I am hiking in shorts and a tee shirt and starting to shiver. I drop my pack and pull out my rain gear just as it starts to rain. I continue to hike and start to warm up from my activity. I'm actually making good time and miles so I decided to skip the next Shelter and keep moving. At one point I am at Janes Bald and the wind is blowing so hard that it blew me down. I got up and it took all I had to walk into the wind without getting blown off my feet again. I finally got to Stan Murray Shelter where I was the only person there. I set my tent up in the shelter and am hoping and praying that no one else shows. If they do, I'll have to move my tent outside.  A dangerous thing to look out for on the trail...While hiking there are several things to look out for that do not get the attention they deserve. I'll cover one of them now. This creature lurks on the trail in the most stealthful way. A unsuspecting hiker is certain to be caught by surprise. The Rootapus -Snakeopotamus (my Latin name for them) lay about the trail waiting for some poor unsuspecting hiker to step over them. Their method of attack is that they will reach up, grab your boot, and attempt to trip you and bring you down. Tired hikers are more likely to be tripped up by them so you must always be on alert. They are very clever and at times will hide there whereabouts under leaves. They resemble tree roots and actually will anchor themselves to the ground but don't be fooled by these very dangerous creatures. Step high and keep those boots out of there reach.

The storm was one that you didn't want to be sleeping out under those big trees for fear of a widow maker coming crashing through my tent. The trail was littered with huge branches and tree blow overs which was a true indication of just how severe this storm was. It was still raining when I awoke so I got a bit of a late start. I decided that I would hike the 1.9 miles to the Overmountain Shelter for my morning coffee and breakfast. Overmountain is a shelter made from a converted barn. I arrived right at 8:30 and talked with a couple of thru-hikers that said it had been packed last night. Now I was really happy with my decision to stay at Stan Murray (not that my feet could have gone any further anyway). The sun was just breaking through the clouds providing the view that this shelter is known for. It was kind of funny how a group of us were taking in the view. We were just staring at the mountains as if a high action movie were playing before us. No action... just amazing beauty. After my breakfast I packed up and hit the trail, or should I say, the river. All that rain water has to go somewhere and why not the trail? Being the path of least resistance for all that water, unfortunately, this same trail was the one we all had to trek. Water was at times up to my ankles. In the ""shallows"" it was like hiking in pudding. The Roan Highlands are known for both the intensity/difficulty of the hike and for their views. Well, a heavy fog provided cover for the views, but the hiking difficulties remained.  The highlight of the day was passing the sign that I had officially left North Carolina safely behind me.

I did the 15 plus miles in six hours of stress free hiking. I had the pleasure of hiking a couple of those hours with ""Mr. T"". ""Mr. T"" and I are close in age, had the same pace, and had great conversation. We split just as I was getting ready to stop by Kincora Hostel to pick up a package my sister had sent me. I didn't actually plan on staying at the Hostel, but quickly changed my mind once I arrived. Bob Peoples is the owner/operator and is a legend of the AT. His warm welcome convinced me to stay (that and his twelve cats). The deal here is that you can stay for the recommended donation of $5.00. The Hostel common area includes a full kitchen for hikers use. Showers, laundry, bathrooms and shuttle to local restaurants and an Ingles grocery store are also available. This is a 'not for profit' Hostel... don't expect the Hilton.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Stanley the dog today. As I was hiking, Stanley and his owner (I have no idea what his name is) were both hiking South. Stanley is a Lab-Irish Setter mix with the sweetest disposition.

Bob Peoples, the proprietor, sliced off four huge pieces of banana nut bread for me to take on the trail. It never made it to the trail though... I ended up being the only hiker at the hostel last night which made for a very quiet night. Boots (an orange tabby) kept me company as he slept with me all night.  The start of my days hike was unique in that the rock formations I was climbing were like huge blocks stacked on top of one another. It amazes me how the physical makeup differs from one mountain to another. This mountain (Pond Mountain) looked as though fine stone masons erected it stone by stone, carefully cutting and fitting each one in a specific predetermined location. Like those masons that had built the great cathedrals and pyramids, this mountain in its own free form shape was designed and built by a Greater power, each stone placed exactly were He planned.  The hike started today with a huge descent over a boulder field and the deeper the descent the louder the roaring Laurel Fork Falls. When the falls finally comes into view, I found myself moving in slow motion as it was totally mesmerizing.  Laurel Falls was worth the price of admission which was that huge descent. That ticket provided a front row seat making me an audience of one for the big show.  Well, sometimes you have to go down before you can go up. Reality hit soon after I started my hiking away from the falls. Pond Mountain asked for full payment for that show at a cost of 3,800 feet. It was brutal, but still worth it. Tomorrow's hike looks to be a lot easier with limited elevation changes so I'm hoping to put down some big miles. That should make for a short day on Tuesday taking me into Damascus. I might actually take Wednesday off as my first ""zero"" after a full month of hiking. I'm tired!!!

I realized that I left out a big portion of yesterday's adventures.  Once I came to US 321, I stopped at Shook Branch Recreation Park, which is a picnic and sandy beach area. This was the perfect spot for me to sit at a table and enjoy my lunch. The whole time I imagined how perfect it would have been if there had been a coke machine there. Anyway, after lunch I started my hiking again where the trail takes you along the shoreline of Lake Watauga. In fact, the trail follows this man made, dammed lake for a couple of miles. You continue until you cross over the Watauga Dam, follow the road that is sparsely blazed, and then back on the trail for a big ascent. The higher I went the bigger the view of the lake, which was breathtaking. Higher still and I could see the marina across the lake. My imagination ran away with me as I was still thinking about that coke machine. That marina had to be 10 miles away and I still thought how great it would be to mosey on over there for an ice cold drink. My imagination didn't stop there. I imagined walking up to those blue canopies and finding a dockside bar. I sat down and people started asking if I was an AT thru- hiker. I responded that yes, I was, and I would tell them all about my adventures after I ordered myself a cold drink.
""No, Whistler"", they all say, ""Your money is no good here."" ""We're buying your drinks today."" 
""Well, in that case, I'll have the big slurp bottomless mug of ice cold beer. Once that beer arrives, I'll wet my whistle and tell you my stories..."" 
So about today's hike... it rained almost all day, I got soaked, my feet turned into prunes, I hiked 24.8 miles, the end. I did want to journal about the ruins that you see as you hike the AT. It's not uncommon to come across an old stone foundation or to find a fully intact stone fireplace in the middle of nowhere. These are the remnants of a time when the people of Appalachia lived and worked in these mountains. There is a long history of the governments involvement in ""assisting"" the people of Appalachia. Job creation, education, the introduction of coal mining for jobs, the building of dams for cheap electricity, and actually relocating them to remove them from poverty. A lot of falsehoods, myths, and distortions were promoted to support those acts. Later studies and published papers dispelled those stereotypes that unfortunately still follow the people of Appalachia today. Whistler","Vandeventer Shelter

It had been raining all day and as I turned to start back on the trail the sun made its first daily appearance. I took this as a sign and marched on. I found the perfect stealth site just over two miles further north and yes, two miles closer to Damascus. I took this as a sign...

Well, believe it or not, you actually plan and work when taking a day off the trail. Sure, there is plenty of down time to eat and drink... and repeat throughout the day. But, one must resupply, repair and replace worn and broken equipment, and study the trail guide for the next stops and future resupplies. For example(s), the insoles of my boots had worn through after this nearly first 500 miles. I picked up a new pair at Mt. Rogers Outfitters. For the record I could never recommend Mt. Rogers Outfitters highly enough. Next, a buckle on one of the straps that I use for cinching my tent to my backpack broke. The guys at Mt. Rogers Outfitters came up with a fix for that issue and didn't even charge me. Next, I was off to the local grocery store about one mile away for a few odds and ends. My food bag is now fully stocked for the next 100 miles. So, here I am fully restocked, recharged and ready to lay down some north bound miles.

The weather was horrible with winds gusting at 40 and 50 mph. Tree limbs could be heard snapping off trees all night.

More about the ponies...Located at Massie Gap: Rhododendron Trail in Grayson Highlands State Park, herds of ""introduced"" Virginia Highlands Ponies have roamed free and wild along the grassy balds and spruce forests of Wilburn Ridge for more than forty years. Their thick manes blow in the wind as they graze alongside the trails.The ponies are very accustomed to humans and rarely halt their grazing as hikers pass close by. Many locals touch and feed the ponies, though this practice is frowned upon and against park policy. Each year, park officials round up the herd and check for health problems in addition to reducing the herd size if necessary; the excess colts are sold at auction.

A father, ""Boon Dog"", and daughter, ""Boots"", were already set up and had a great fire going. They are southbound section hiking for 3 days. They invited me to join them by their fire and didn't need to ask twice. I fixed my dinner by their fire and enjoyed the warmth of both the fire and their company. Morning came quickly and I knew I had to get up and going, finally listening to myself at 6:00. I was on the trail just before 8:00 with one primary objective in mind. Pizza lay in waiting a short 23.2 miles up the trail. 23.2 miles is ordinarily a great distance, but it seemed like a much shorter distance with pizza as motivation. To explain, Partnership Shelter is located right next to the Mount Rogers Welcome Center. It's known as the only shelter on the AT where you can order and have delivered Pizza Hut pizza. I arrived at 6:30, went to the welcome center where they have a free phone set up along with the menu. I ordered two medium meat lovers, ate one for dinner with the other one planned for breakfast (I love cold pizza).  Speaking of food (a favorite pastime for long distance hikers) I realized a phenomenon regarding my food bag. I call it my hate/love relationship with my food bag. It goes something like this...When you are leaving a town after a resupply, your food bag is packed full. You hate the bag because of the additional weight, but you love the bag because it carries all the food you are going to eat.  As your food bag's content diminishes you love your bag for how light it is which allows you to hike quickly, but you hate your food bag for the lack of food within.  As an aside, I didn't see a single hiker all day. Not a NOBO, SOBO, section hiker, or day hiker...no one!!!

I had thought I'd give the Partnership Shelter a try instead of setting up my tent. All the hikers there were young... early to mid twenties young. I thought I'd be safe with regards to heavy snoring. I should have known better... It was right at 10:30 after staring at the shelter ceiling for two hours when I decided to pitch my tent. It takes me about five minutes to set it up and I'm guessing I was asleep the sixth minute (I probably snored myself to sleep). Truth be told, it's me, I'm a very light sleeper. No fault to those that snore... they are always content.  The snow and rain we had just two days ago made for wet socks and boots. The perfect combination for soft and tender feet. My right little piggy has developed a good sized blister (yep, I stabbed him) while a few of his mates are thinking about joining the party. Crazy how something so small can make for tough miles.  The weather today was what you hike hundreds of miles for... it was perfect. Beautiful, sunny and warm, but with some cool breezes too.  My objective today was to have a short mileage day to allow my dogs the opportunity to recover from the beating they've been through lately. I had planned on stopping at Davis Path campsite, but quickly determined that there was not a level tent site there nor any water; backpack on back and hiked an additional 4 miles.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559593,"Day 37: What an absolutely beautiful day I had today; clear skies, sunny, warm with some cool breezes thrown in for good measure. I realized while hiking along this morning that some of my journaling might sound like whining. My reporting on weather or trail conditions is nothing more than a daily account of what had occurred that day. I'm prepared (I sure as heck should be) to accept whatever the trail throws my way. I'm not going to lie... a good percentage of the time it's miserable. In fact I would venture to say that any thru-hiker would say it is the most difficult thing they have ever done and I for one wouldn't change one minute of it.  Back to today's events...I had hiked 17.5 miles today before I saw anyone. So funny how this can happen. You know there are lots of other crazy fools out there, but you can hike all day and not see anyone. So, as I was hiking over Chestnut Ridge and toward Chestnut Knob Shelter, a hiker was sitting all by himself. I walked over, said hello and introduced myself as Whistler. Without skipping a beat, he asked me, ""How was your pizza?"" My first thought was that perhaps he had followed me through my journal. No, as it turns out his wife had been following my journal and told her husband to say hello if he met me. His trail name is ""Now or Never"". I had seriously thought about spending the night there (in my tent of course), but really needed water and that shelter did not have a source close by. This shelter is apparently an old forest warden's home/station that has since been converted to a hikers shelter. It is all stone construction with four walls and a door which is very unusual. Most shelters are of the three sided ""lean to"" construction. So, off I went just another 1.5 miles to the perfect stealth site and a spring of water just bubbling out of the ground (I think I'll fix me a cup of tea). Finally, I am so appreciative of those that have sent me messages via my guestbook on this site. I enjoy receiving and responding to them as well. I wanted to point out that I'm unable to respond if there is no email entered. Some have chosen to not give an address and that's fine too. I just wanted to make sure that I didn't come across as unappreciative or rude. Whistler","Reed Creek

Seems that a couple of toe nails are thinking about abandoning ship. I've done all I can do in my feeble attempt to save them. I've got them taped on right now in the hopes that the nail beds can firm up. Of course I stubbed my boots into some roots and rocks several times along the way today...OUCH!!! Today was another day of seeing absolutely no northbound hikers. I saw several day, section, and southbound hikers, but not a single northbounder. It's a true mystery... did they get sucked into that gingerbread house out in the middle of the forest? Are they currently hiker stew? Is this a phenomenon unexplained like the Devil's Triangle? Bigfoot? More importantly, am I next? I'll keep you posted. It's turkey hunting season... I crossed paths with two young guys out turkey hunting this morning. They had a lot of questions about my hiking and the AT in particular, and I had a few questions about turkey hunting. They even demonstrated their turkey calls for me as well. Sure was glad I didn't where my turkey feather headdress this morning.  Today was a day of manna from heaven (more commonly known as trail magic).  While coming off the trail to cross VA 623 I noticed a couple standing by a van when I arrived. I said hello and we exchanged a few pleasant remarks. I'm not exactly sure what prompted what happened next, but I was invited to have something to eat. It turns out that she is an avid hiker with a true passion for the AT, having hiked several hundred miles as a section hiker with her husband (Brad) as her ground support. So, she asks if I'd like turkey or ham. I obviously do not care as I would have eaten the tires off their van. Next, granola bars and cheese sticks were handed to me. I felt blessed beyond my comprehension. I asked her what her trail name is to which she replied that she didn't have one. I offered up ""Cornucopia"" as a trail name which she accepted. Yes, the back of the van was full with a bounty of food and drink, but more importantly, ""Cornucopia"" fit her bountiful spirit.  ""Cornucopia"" and I met at the next shelter and had lunch together as well (while I also performed more surgery on my feet... how appetizing that must have been). After lunch I hiked on past her and when I arrived at Suiter Road, Brad was waiting to meet his wife and I was on the receiving end of more trail magic. Juice and popsicles were just what the Dr. ordered.  Now, several hours later and toward the end of my day, trail magic strikes again. As I came to US route 52, a 2016 thru-hiker, ""Pigeon toe"", is just getting ready to pack up his motor home after giving out trail magic all day. ""Pigeon toe"" sees me, calls me over and loads me up. Let's just say that that last 1.5 miles of the day were the toughest because of all the additional weight bestowed upon me by trail angel, ""Pigeon toe"". And now it's time for hiker advice:a place for everything and everything in its place... When thru-hiking, you will save yourself time and aggravation if you place everything in the same place every time. It takes the worrying out of your hiking if you know where everything is.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559944,"Day 38: It got to the point that it was almost not funny anymore. So, I started to think maybe I had it all wrong. What if I was the subject of a cruel hoax? What if someone painted white blazes on trees and I was going in a huge circle? Maybe the other NOBOs were sitting around a fire asking about me. ""Hey, what do you suppose ever happened to that hiker from, where was that again? Oh yea, Nova Scotia I think. Where is that anyway? What was his name again? Whittler? Whiskers? No, no it was Whistler, that's it I'm sure. A nice fellow...handsome too. Maybe he got caught up in that wicked witch gingerbread house thing... you know, he might be hiker stew by now.""  But then it happened... I found a NOBO. ""Will-da-Beast"" was discovered by yours truly just before 2:00 today. I'm not alone after all... I also met ""Dr. J"" on the trail right after I had a light (first lunch) at Jenny Knob Shelter today. ""Dr. J"" is doing a section hike through most of Virginia. We hiked together for about two hours which was nice to talk and hike with someone that hiked at the same pace as me. I convinced him to join me for lunch (second lunch) at Trent's grocery store. Trent's has a solid reputation for a great hiker, double cheeseburger. I woke up this morning thinking about that burger and it didn't disappoint. I had an order of fries, bottle of coke, and a big bag of Fritos corn chips. It wasn't till after I ate every bit of it that I read the calorie count for the Fritos, 160 calories per serving. A serving is 28 chips. 10 servings per bag... 1,600 calories!!! Score!!! I'm pretty sure I got my suggested hiker 6,000 calories for the day.  Today's hike was really nice with limited elevation changes and easy terrain (the feet appreciated that). A lot of PUDS (pointless ups and downs) or as my granddaughter Katy Ellis would say, ""Pointless uppa downs.""  I found a perfect place to set up my tent on a beautiful open grassy field. I have a relatively short day tomorrow so I think I might sleep in a bit. I'm just about 22 miles from Pearisburg where I'm planning to take a room. It's VERY much time for a shower, laundry, real food, and a resupply. I don't want to get there late tomorrow because I'll want a full day there. So, I hope to find a camp site a mile or two out of town and hike in the next morning... maybe for breakfast!!!And now a poem:      The Wood How many miles must I walk  Before I feel worthy of our talk? I've walked amongst you countless days, My hope, my tribute to pay you praise.  The branches strong, the very best Providing refuge for your birds to nest.  The roots dig deep with all their might  To grasp and clutch the soil tight.  Poised there soaring to reach for sky,  The true ambition is the reason why.  The air is pure, the air is clean.  Your thankless purpose that I glean.  And when it's time to fall and go,Enrich the soil that the young may grow.  The time is now, I know I should,Praise you Lord for The Wood.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559998,"Day 39: Having planned a later start today, I didn't get up until 7:00 this morning. I had a big breakfast consisting of two packages of oatmeal and a pack of pop-tarts with my coffee.  I took it slow and easy knowing that I didn't have far to go and that I'd be spending the day tomorrow in Pearisburg. I've got it all planned out; Hardee's for breakfast, Lucky Star Chinese AYCE (all you can eat) for lunch, Pizza Hut for dinner and Dairy Queen for dessert. In between my planned meals there will be shower(s)... 3-4, laundry, shopping/ resupply and the post office.  While hiking today I thought about some of the things I've learned and would like to pass along:1. Bears do not poop in the woods. They poop on the trail. 2. If you meet another thru-hiker and you ask them their trail name and they tell you, but they don't ask for your trail name, put your pack back on your back and keep hiking. If you stay you will have a conversation with one of the latest of a generation of narcissists. They will let you know how great they are and how blessed you are to be in their presence. Thankfully, I have also met many of that same generation whose Mommas have brought them up right.3. Trail Angels love giving as much and perhaps more than hikers enjoy receiving trail magic. 4. Trail Angels really are Angels!!!5. Store brand ""Pop-Tarts"" taste exactly like Kellogg's branded Pop-Tarts and cost far less. 6. Flavor your water, you'll drink a lot more if you do. 7. Sit down whenever you get the chance. 8. If while hiking you hear drumming, the natives are not restless. You are hearing the sound of a male Grouse thumping/beating its wings. It's what they do to impress the chicks...Look for more 'learnings' to follow once I've learned them...Whistler","Stealth camp

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560065,"Day 40: What's that you say? You want to know what a thru-hiker eats?Before I go there...So it appears that as of late, the ATGC (Appalachian Trail Garden Club) has been working evenings as I sleep. Beautiful wild flowers have seemingly arrived almost as though secret gardeners worked through the night to provide a gift of Spring color for us thru-hikers. Trilliums, wild violet, dogwoods, and bloodroot abound as though on a secret schedule that only they know; others to arrive based on a later and less rushed timeline, another future blessing for us wayfarers. So, Guthook (a detailed, map-based smart phone guide) claims I only hiked 1.7 miles today and that is what I will record. But, it was actually 3.5 miles, but who's counting? I am for sure! This was my shortest day yet, and yet, the most relaxing day as well. I'm staying at the Plaza motel for $44 (tax in) and it is perfect. It's clean, the people running it are kind and I would highly recommend it to all those coming up behind me. Oh, another perk, Linda will do your laundry which is included in your nights stay.  I met up with ""Trinity"", "" Hugs"", ""Falls"", and ""Peaches"" this afternoon. We agreed to meet at a local Mexican restaurant for lunch. The food (and beer) were great and the company was even better.  Ok, so Trail Angel Susan (my sister) wants to know what a typical day's ""menu"" for a thru-hiker looks like. Well, besides the gourmet/homemade blessings she sends me along the way... here we go...Breakfast:Pop-tarts (store brand, got these on sale!) - 400 calories. Coffee (delicious, but zero calories). Lunch:Flour tortillas - 2x 80 calories plus pepperoni - 280 calories and cheese at 240 calories. Snacks: Cliff bar at 260 calories, dried fruit and nuts - 170 calories Dinner:Harmony House vegetarian soup mix - 300 calories mixed with Ramen noodles - 380 calories. That comes to 2,190 calories... hmm, no wonder I'm loosing so much weight. Thru-hikers typically burn 4,000-5,000 calories per day. I should rightfully insert that there are some days that those ""Trail Angels"" previously mentioned supplement and contribute added calories. And, once again, it's so sincerely appreciated. The green ""Sea To Summit"" bag in the picture is my food bag. It weighs an estimated 12 lbs and will take me to Dalesville, about 100 miles from here. One final addition to this posting, town visits are for ""cameling up"". We come, we devour, and we leave before they ever knew what hit them... it's what we do... after all, we are thru-hikers.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560231,"Day 41:   I got up at my usual time this morning and actually had to get my bearings. I'm so accustomed to waking up in my tent that I had to orientate myself as to where I was and why was I in a bed. I decided that I ""needed"" to take one last shower (my third since checking in yesterday). Sure glad there isn't a surcharge for all the hot water I used.  I was dressed, packed and out the door by 7:15. Linda, the manager at the Plaza Motel saw me leaving and came outside to say goodbye and to wish me good luck. What a sweetheart. I made my way to the Hardee's to take advantage of one last serving of their egg, bacon and cheese biscuits. When I got back to the trail I remembered something that I failed to mention yesterday. When I slept up at Pearis Ledge, I had an incredible view of the town of Pearisburg. I had this funny feeling watching over this distant town far below me. I likened it to the Grinch looking out over Whoville. The view actually got better... I woke up in the middle of the night to ""answer the call of nature"". When I stepped from my tent I was taken by total surprise. The town lights gave me pause as it looked like I was looking down at stars. Stars above me, stars below me... just beautiful.  So, sometimes the forest isn't really all that pretty. For example, I walked through a huge area that has been devastated by the Gypsy moth. It was actually depressing to walk through the carnage. It's difficult to imagine that an insect could do this much damage. As you can read in the picture posted, the Forest Service had to close a shelter and area camping due to the danger of falling trees, all because of an invasive moth. How this part of the forest ever recovers I'll never know. Tonight I'm camping at The Captains place. The Captain is a gentleman who's property is right on the trail and welcomes hikers to camp on his golf course of a yard. It gets better... you have to cross a creek by way of a zip line to get to his property. So very cool!!! Once you arrive, you are invited to get a soft drink out of the refrigerator on the back porch...as many as you can drink.   There are about 12 of us camped here tonight. And now a poem; I saw her standing there...
The time I saw her standing there, oh, how to meet her, how do I dare? While other fellows thought the same, I could not fault, I could not wain.  To court this girl, I'd do my best.  I'll act on instinct and beat the rest.  If I failed would I be less? It was to be for she said yes.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560424,"Day 42:   Last night while enjoying my third cold soft drink (thank you Captain), I saw ""Acorn"" hobbling along. ""You OK ""Acorn""?"", I asked. ""Yep, it's just that after I take my boots off I feel like a ninety year old man"", he replied. Whew, imagine my relief when I discovered I'm not the only one. I hate to say it but misery does love company.  Here's the deal. Your feet are going to outgrow your boots... no kidding, you will gain at least a shoe size from all this hiking. So, I began this hike taking a size 10, but now I'm at least a size 11; however, I'm still trying to fit into a size 10 boot. It doesn't work!!!  I decided I was going to take action. The next town is Dalesville, which is another four days hike. So, new boots are going to have to wait till I get there. In the meantime, I came up with a plan last night and woke up early to implement ""the plan"". At 4:45 this morning I wrapped all toes with KT tape (an athletic tape). The rest of my plan is that I go commando. No under garments. That's right boys and girls, my feet go naked today... no socks. I realized that I had to make more room in my boots and removing my heavy wool hiking socks from the equation just made sense.  At 6:45, I was fed, packed and pulling myself across the creek via the zip line. The yard was full of tents with many takers of the Captain's generous hospitality. Not a soul was stirring as I'm certain all were in a comfortable sugar coma from all the free sodas the night before.  So, off I go to hike a new day and guess what? It worked!!! I was like a gazelle leaping from rock to rock and boulder to boulder. I was like poetry in motion. If I had tights, I might have auditioned for the ABC (Appalachian Ballet Company). I was unstoppable... at least until about lunch time that is. Then it was back to walking on shards of glass. I'd rather walk on a bed of red hot coals... still, NO PAIN NO MAINE!!! I just can't get to Dalesville fast enough.  Today's terrain was literally a rock and boulder scramble. Jumping stone to stone and boulder to boulder with several 2000 foot ascents. There were no real notable views, just a lot of climbing and walking through more of the Gypsy moth devastation.  It started to rain just as I was coming up to Laurel Creek shelter at about 4:30. My plan had been to hike a few more miles, but staying dry in the shelter won me over. With nobody else here (yet), I may sleep in the shelter and avoid having to set up and take down my tent in the rain. Fingers crossed...Whistler","The Captains place

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560571,"Day 43: Thank you Audie Murphy... Well, I ended up having the shelter to myself last night. If mice were cuddling up in my sleeping bag with me I had no idea as I passed out at 8:00 to the sounds of a babbling creek. I was up early (it's what I do) and hiking by 7:00. The trail was kind to me and especially to my feet, gradual ascents and well graded trails for the most part. I enjoyed my lunch today from the top of a rock outcropping, wide open and expansive while overlooking a deep valley with other unnamed mountains as a backdrop. I watched two beautiful brown eagles soaring overhead looking for there next prey. Gliding effortlessly on unseen currents that gave them an unfair advantage to the unsuspecting. I watched, I'll admit, with pleasure and guilt, hoping to witness their success. Perhaps they weren't hunting at all... maybe they were simply watching a thru-hiker eating his lunch from a rock outcropping.  It rained most of the day, a light rain I should say. I put my rain cover over my pack, but didn't bother with my rain gear. It felt nice, cool and not drenching. I took an afternoon break at Niday Shelter for a snack and an opportunity to step out of the rain. I took my boots off to allow my feet to dry and reapply some new KT tape.  Just five miles past Niday Shelter brought me to a memorial for Audie Murphy. The memorial is on a short side trail and it's not to be missed. Audie Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War ll. Apparently, he died in an airplane crash on this mountainous site. The memorial was surrounded by stones placed there by visitors, as well, other personal affects, most notably were a large number of military dog tags. It was an honor and quite humbling to spend a few moments there. Thank you Audie Murphy for your sacrifice so that I might have the freedoms I enjoy.    Before my poem, a back story... my sister had sent me a text message about a week ago. She was telling me about the moon she was looking at, the same moon as I was... too easy. After seeing Audie Murphy's memorial, I thought what his last text to Pat (his wife) might have said...And now a poem... Murphy's Star Hello my love, do truly try,  To look toward heaven up in the sky.  You know I battled and gave a fight  For all that's just, good and right.  So close to home was not to be,  A tragic flight has taken me.  Do not cry, do not fret. We'll be together, just not yet.  There is a star by the Milky Way,  Exactly which I can not say.  Too many miles stand between;  So many foot steps to be seen.  Yes, I know it's so very far.  But let us find the very same star.  It's up there on this starry night.  If you look you'll find it right.  If dark clouds do block the light,  Please try again night after night.  You will fail, don't fret my dear.  With every step you'll soon be there.  It's worth it to me, it will do no harm. Please try each night till your in my arms. Whistler","Laurel Creek Shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560659,"Day 44: The continental Divide...With yesterday being so full, I never mentioned the fact that I passed the Continental Divide.  I'll come back to that in a moment.  It was a beautiful day today with overcast skies, but no rain which made for comfortable temperatures. I hiked up to a well known rock outcropping called the Dragon's Tooth. It was a difficult climb to say the least, but well worth the side trail. The AT crosses Virginia Route 785 at mile marker 704. I had seen and or read about a store close by, so I made my way to find it. It was quite close and another worthy side trip. I had a pint of Moose Tracks ice cream with a Coke chaser. Now I was ready to hike some more. I'm at the Catawba Shelter and so far I am alone... do I dare attempt another night in a shelter? So back to the Continental Divide... The last place I ever expected to see a sign indicating that I was passing the Continental Divide was here on the AT. Apparently, this marks where waters on the west side of the Sinking Creek mountain flow into the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico while the east side flows into the James River and the Atlantic.  I had a funny thought about two friends and their experience with the Continental Divide...The story of Drip and Drop...Drip and Drop were best of friends, they vowed this to the very end.  They met that long and rainy day And now together all the way.  It's been a long and wild ride, they even worked at the slip and slide. Then one day Drip made a claim, It looks as though it's gonna rain.  Drop agreed, now they're moving fast.  It looked as though their future's cast.  On their way with the force, It looked as though they were off course.  There was a sign, what did it say? I think we may go different ways.  I do not think we decide;  The sign it said, ""Continental Divide"".  Goodbye my friend, it's time to go. It's what we do, go with the flow. Whistler","Stealth camp

The plus to this is not having to setup and take down my tent. This was welcomed in as it rained all night. It was also a bit cold last night as well. I wanted to get an early start today because I had planned a full schedule. I was up at 5:30, dressed in full rain gear and hiking by 7:00. First on my ""to do"" list was to hike up to McAfee Knob. This outcropping is said to be the most photographed location on the AT. When I arrived I was the only one there (no one to take my picture) and it was too foggy anyway. OK, let's hit the next location on my "" to do"" list. Tinker Cliffs was just another 4.5 miles away. The Tinker Cliffs are known for the quarter mile of cliffs with a westerly view. Bet the views are great when it's not FOGGY. Does fog actually serve a practical purpose? Thanks a lot Drip and Drop!!! I stopped in at Lambert's Meadow Shelter for a quick and early lunch and a chance to dry off.  Next item on my master plan was to get into Daleville. I got into town right at 2:30, checked into the Super 8, showered and did laundry. Three Lil Pigs BBQ for dinner is definitely happening. I made a decision while hiking here that I was also going to take a ""Zero"" tomorrow. I need to resupply, get new boots and honestly, I need to give myself a day of rest... especially my feet.

I was cooking along at a brisk pace when I was caught off guard and my heart skipped a beat, or two, or maybe even three. Well, as you can see from the photo... just a momma cow and calf. Great, now I was thinking about hamburgers the rest of the day.  It's true...Three Lil Pigs is great BBQ and highly recommended. As an added bonus, thru-hikers receive a free (huge) banana pudding for dessert.  Even though I was taking a ""Zero"" today, I still started my day early. I made it down to the Super 8 breakfast room at 6:30 and filled up on the early morning offerings.  After breakfast, I was off to the local Kroger for my resupply. I also made a trip to the local outfitter. Unfortunately, I couldn't find boots that felt right. So I decided to try a thin pair of hiking socks instead. I figured that I had been hiking the past three days without socks and my feet had felt much better. My boots still have a couple of hundred miles to give too. I walked all day around town today and they feel great. I guess they will get the ""trail- trial"" tomorrow.  I also purchased a quilt and sleeping bag liner and sent my three season bag home. I know, I know, it's a bit early to be dumping the warmth of my three season bag, but it weighs too much and is way too bulky. It weighs three pounds seven ounces. My new quilt is one pound and the liner is nine ounces, nearly two pounds less and way less volume. I still have my base layer that I can wear on those certain cool/colder nights that can still occur.  I ran into ""Fish"", ""Radio"", and ""Sherlock"" today as well. ""Fish"" was meeting a friend he had worked with in the past and ""Radio"" was running his town errands, so ""Sherlock"" and I had dinner and a beer at Three Lil Pigs (and free banana pudding). I'm planning an early start tomorrow so I'll hit the breakfast downstairs at 6:00 and will be pounding the trail by 7:00.  And now a point to ponder... Knowing that I had to mail my sleeping bag, I asked the Super 8 desk clerk where the post office is in town. She gave me directions which placed it about a mile away. Here I am, having hiked over seven hundred miles and now that I'm in town, a one mile walk seemed to be a great distance. It's funny how ones perspective changes in less than 24 hours.","Daleville

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561097,"Day 47:  Could the forest really have changed this much in just one day? I was up at 5:30 and had boots on the trail by 6:30 and two things really stood out to me as soon as I found myself in the woods this morning. First, as if out of nowhere and just since I've been off the trail for one day, the trees have leafed out. I love that pale green new leaf growth. It feels so fresh, new and alive.  The second thing I noticed right away was all the spider webs crossing the trail. I guess the first hiker in the morning gets to bust through the webs spun by the spiders overnight. It was so annoying to constantly have them in my face. What a waste of time for those spiders... What exactly is it that they are trying to catch anyway? The trail was kind to me today with gradual ascents and descents and virtually no rocks. This made for quick and easier miles.  This section of Virginia will follow the Blue Ridge Parkway for about one hundred miles. It crisscrosses the Parkway numerous times while also being so close you can count the passing cars. The whole time, unbeknownst to those drivers, there are hikers on the unseen AT. I had driven the Blue Ridge Parkway many times over the years and had no idea the AT was literally mere feet from the road.  So about those spiders...Webster the spider Webster the spider went to work each day,to catch a hiker is what they say.  He'd work all day, he'd work all night.  He'd spin his web good and tight.  To catch a hiker, difficult as it seems, It's always been his lifelong dream.  Early one morning when his spinning was done, He prayed for a hiker, Oh Lord, just one.  Along comes a hiker taking great big strides;  Webster knows he's got to run and hide.  The hiker is stuck now and can no longer walk When along comes Webster to have a talk.  I've done it, I've done it, I caught you, your mine!  The hiker looks at him and says there's no time.  Ridiculous hiker, I'll serve you with grog.

I caught a bit of a break this morning as there was a 30 minute break in the rain just as I was breaking camp. It's kind of funny how no matter what you do, you're going to get soaked. Rain just has its way with you. It's going to find what's dry and make it wet... no matter what. At one point I found myself standing under a huge tree and thought how I was hardly getting wet. About 2.5 seconds later I realized that I wasn't getting any closer to Maine either and hiked on. I finally had to quit hiking at 4:00 today. I was tired, cold and soaked to the bone. The first step once I made it to Thunder Hill Shelter was to get out of my wet clothes. The second step was to get hot food in my stomach. Besides the heavy rainfall, there were some tough climbs today as well. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow as it's supposed to be even worse. OK, on three everyone, one, two, three ...

I thought about going back to sleep, but realized that it had stopped raining. I dread taking my tent down while it's raining so that was motivation enough. It was a pretty cold morning as well. Getting dressed was not something I was looking forward to because my clothes were still soaked and cold from the rain yesterday. At one point I had seriously thought about wearing my dry camp clothes, but knew I'd regret it later if I had. So I bit the bullet and changed into those stinky, wet and cold clothes. I had boots on the trail at 6:15 and no idea how many miles I would do today. The weather will help make that decision. As it turned out, the rain was light which made for cool and productive hiking. In fact, today was my highest mileage day to date.  After crossing the James River Foot Bridge (named after William T. Foot ) I met ""Ant Man"" and his friend Mike. ""Ant Man"" was just getting back on the trail after a couple days off with his friend Mike. They both let me know to be on the lookout for trail magic. A short time later I found Mike laying out some soft drinks and beer. See the photo in my photo gallery of Mike being caught red handed.  Toward the very end of a long day of hiking I came across another memorial (see the photo to the left). This was a tough one in that it's for a very young child.

I just couldn't take anymore of this rain. I'm at Brown Mountain Creek Shelter where I stopped for lunch and was shivering so hard that I couldn't stop. The rain let up just as I was thinking about what I should do. I made the decision to set up my tent and climb in. I had to get out of these wet clothes.  So backing up to this morning... it rained like crazy last night and into the morning. At around 6:00 it sounded as though it was slowing down. I jumped into action and packed as quickly as I could. I got back on the trail by 7:00 with big plans that just never developed. At one point I came to a creek that had swollen from the rain so much that I actually paced the shore like an ape looking for a safe way across. I finally realized that I would have to ford the torrential force of this usually calm creek. I had thought about taking my boots off, but why bother, at this point everything was already soaked. When I finally arrived at Brown Mountain Creek Shelter, ""Will-Da-Beast"" was there. I asked him when he arrived and he laughed when he replied, ""Are you kidding me, I got here last night and decided I wasn't hiking in that mess"". I guess that's when I decided I needed to have enough sense to get out of the rain. Hey, I've got plenty of food and there's no shortage of water either.  Today's milestone? I passed the 800 mile mark!!! So, as it is like me, I couldn't stop thinking of Little Ottie Cline Powell from the memorial I passed yesterday. What was that little boy thinking? What was he looking for? How long did they search for him? How difficult it had to be to find his body five months after he was lost. And now a poem...Little Ottie Oh little Ottie, not yet five, So full of dreams and so alive. You ventured off from school they say.  To run? To hide? To skip or play? Was it in you to explore? The warmth and safety you ignore.  They searched the very mountainside That you had chosen to abide.  And when all was given and all lost hope,  How did your mother begin to cope?

It was still raining of course but I felt I had to get moving. I ate, changed (back into my wet clothes), packed my backpack, and waited patiently in my tent for a break in the the rain. When that never occurred, I just crawled out and took the tent down in the pouring rain. The issue with rain isn't hiking in it. That's no big deal. The Problem is when you are having toenails coming off and blisters that need to dry out to heal, but they are swimming in your boots instead. Walking has become painful and you need to be able to walk when you're hiking. I had just made it to the top of Cole Mountain when I ran into two Southern Virginia University students out for a hike. I joked with them about being out there in the nasty weather. They told me that they were supposed to be studying for finals, but hiking in the rain won out. I hobbled down to Hog Camp Gap and saw what I thought must have been their car. I thought that if they came walking down the trail I'd come right out and ask for a ride to a motel. Don't you know that I no sooner turned around and there they were. Kevin and Lauren didn't hesitate to give me that ride. So many thanks to these two special Trail Angels that I believe were sent to assist me in my time of need. I'm at the Budget Inn (that's another story) in Buena Vista for the night and to be honest, possibly two nights. I cut some skin from around one toe and applied Mupirocin ointment for infection and pulled one of those toenails off that's been just hanging on.  I used the blow dryer in my room to dry out my boots, but first had to hand wring out the insoles for how soaked they were. I have already cleaned and dried all my equipment and clothes as well. I'm ready to hike, but need my feet to be just as ready.  The motel is booked solid with hikers that all had enough sense to call it quits. I'm just a bit stubborn and take a bit longer to come to the proper conclusion.  I had been planning on taking a short day and possibly a ""Zero"" on Thursday as I stopped in Rockfish Gap to pick up a resupply Trail Angel Lauren shipped there for me. Now, I'll just swing by, pick up my package and hike on. Whistler","Brown Mountain Creek shelter

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561900,"Day 52: Today was a day for taking action. After breakfast, I found the local pharmacy and put together a foot repair kit; small scissors for cutting and removal of dead skin around blisters, bandages, band-aids, and first aid tape. Next, a trip to Lexington which is a great historic town and one with a fantastic Outfitter. The Maury Express is a three county transit/bus system that took me there for the rate of fifty cents... runs every hour on a continuous loop until 6:00 pm.  Anyway, Walkabout Outfitters is a full service outfitter with a full inventory to meet your/my every need. I decided to go with an Oboz trail runner instead of a boot; lighter, not waterproof (will dry faster when wet ) and a bigger toe box. My boots were a size 10... these are a size 11.5. This really doesn't mean a whole lot as different manufacturers produce according to their size specifications. It's pretty common to have to size up or change styles, i.e., boots to trail runners. In fact, I spoke to one hiker a couple weeks ago that was already on her forth pair. She just can't find what works for her.  The next task at hand was to get a ride back to Hog Camp Gap to take up where I left off yesterday. Aubrey Taylor will pick me up at 7:00 tomorrow morning and I should be back on the trail by 8:00.  It's so typical that the only days I've taken off the trail have been beautiful. Today was no exception. I almost, no, not almost, I did feel guilty for not laying down some miles. In the end I know I have made the right decision to get off the trail and to take care of myself. After all, Katahdin will still be there. Whistler","Budget Inn Buena Vista

As usual, I was up early, dressed and at Hardee's by 6:00 for two biscuits with steak and their bottomless cup of coffee. I made it back to the motel by 6:45 and Aubrey ""Piney"" was already there. I grabbed my pack and trekking poles and jumped into the passenger seat of his 1990, F150. ""Piney"" ended up being exactly what I had imagined from speaking to him over the phone. He is the nicest guy you could ever imagine. In fact, he reminded me of my buddy and neighbor Eric. ""Piney"" is 76 years old and has no interest in not going to work every day... sounds like Eric already... just a salt of the earth kinda guy that really enjoys helping out thru-hikers. In fact, his business card says, ""Helping hikers since 1959"", (the year I was born). He is a great story teller as well, keeping me entertained for the entire ride back to Hog Camp Gap.  Hiker hint... call Aubrey ""Piney"" Taylor at 540-261-6998 or 540-460-3527 if you need a shuttle at a fair price. ""Piney"" covers a long section of the trail including Punchbowl and Salt Log Gap and will go beyond if needed. Call him early... he stays real busy.  About my hike today... it was a really good day with regards to weather (although it's pouring while I'm in my tent right now). Sunny with cool breezes, it was a kind trail for a hiker whose been off trail for a day and a half. The new shoes seem to be working for me as well. I took a couple short breaks, changed the dressing on a couple toes and changed out socks as well. It looks like everything is healing as hoped for.  And now a poem;Feet  Oh, my aching feet.  Step up, step down, and repeat.  The boots they hug the feet too tight.  Perhaps the size is not right.  They pinch and rub and really squeeze.  Perhaps it's time for new ones please.

Whistler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562273,"Day 54: Virginia Blues? Maybe...There are 544 miles of the AT running through Virginia which is nearly one quarter of the trail. They say that thru-hikers get tired of hiking the same state and that there is a feeling of a lack of progress. This has been dubbed ""The Virginia Blues"". I had not felt this way until maybe today. Of the 22 miles hiked today, I would have to say 18 of them were rock scrambles. It was a very difficult day with a couple big climbs and rocky would be an understatement. Three Ridges Mountain is a 4,000 foot summit with steep climbs over three miles that started as soon as I left Harpers Creek this morning. It was difficult for me to find my hiking ""groove"" or the right hiking gear today. I started at 7:00 this morning and didn't finish those 22 miles until 6:30, a real slow one for me.  When I had finally arrived at Paul C. Wolfe Shelter ""Fresh"", ""Karioke"", and ""Maps"" were already there (all three passed me due to how I was dragging). We ate dinner together and I asked them if they wouldn't mind telling me why they were hiking the AT. I let them know that I would be writing their responses in my journal tonight. ""Maps"" is a young guy, probably 24 years old. He has always enjoyed walking, wanted to experience the various landscapes and wants to challenge himself.  ""Fresh"" is 30 years old (hopes to be to Katahdin mid July for his birthday). He had a good paying job as a business analyst but sat in a cubicle every day and wanted more in his life. He's read a lot of adventure books and hiking the AT has always been a dream of his. Finally, he also wanted to challenge himself. ""Karaoke"" is a young man from Germany and just out of high school. He starts sports management school in the fall so he had time to hike the AT. He first learned about it when he had seen a documentary at age twelve and had always wanted to thru-hike as a result. He too said he wanted to challenge himself. My personal observation of the thru-hikers I've met and spent any amount of time with is that thru-hikers tend to be highly motivated (no slackers in the ones still left). They get up early and go to bed early. They hike like they mean it... A quick note to let those that have been following me know that I'm going to take a week off the trail. I'm going to take this week to visit my sister and brother-in-law in Mississippi. They just moved into their new home and to be completely honest, I still have some physical healing to do. A week off the trail will allow me to fully heal my feet and other physical ailments. Hiking twenty plus miles each day will never allow me to fully recover. I hate this, but know I need this. The prize waiting in Maine is just too important to me. I'll keep up with my journal while I'm off the trail with my off trail adventures. Whistler","Harpers Creek Shelter

That was easy...
I thought I'd sleep like a stone last night, but not so. I guess I just had too much on my mind. I woke up at 3:30 and checked on flights to Mobile Alabama... wow, $600 + for a one way ticket.  I looked up car rental locations in Waynesboro and found that Enterprise has a local office. My car is booked for the week.  I hiked the last five miles to Rockfish Gap and another half mile to the Colony Motel for the resupply box my daughter-in-law had shipped there. Once the Enterprise office was open at nine o'clock, I phoned them and they came to pick me up ...that was easy!!!
 The drive to my sister and brother-in-law's house was to be right at 13 hours but I made good time (wink, wink) and made it in twelve including stops. 
 Driving a car felt strange at first. After nearly two months of walking where I needed to go, driving seemed so, so fast. 
 It was also an interesting review or snapshot of my weeks upon weeks of hiking. As I drove south on the highway, I would see signs for all the locations and places I had been. It was as though my life was on rewind...
 Once I got to my sister and brother-in-law's new home I was handed a beer, got the nickel tour of the house, and sat down to the biggest bone-in ribeye steak I had ever seen. It was literally hanging off the plate, served with mushrooms and asparagus with a lemon sauce (I've craved for a real vegetable). 
 Dessert was five of Susan's blueberry muffins I saw on a plate in the kitchen (I think they were supposed to be for breakfast). 
 I believe it was close to two AM when Susan walked me to the guest house. Of course my sister had that refrigerator stocked for my stay (I'll be checking out those interesting beers tomorrow). In the meantime, I think I'll pass out now... goodnight.

Eat, rest, eat, rest, eat, rest...
 Having gone to bed so late, I didn't get up until 8:00 am. Susan and I had coffee together and planned out our day.  I had seen their new home when I had arrived, but not the property. Sitting on thirty acres, the house and guest house face one another with about 150 yards between them. This area is cleared with beautiful oak, pine, magnolias, and some specimen trees scattered through. There are several large fenced paddocks for livestock, stables, and additional out buildings with the remainder of the property being fully wooded. 
 So that plan for the day?  Mostly eat, relax and repeat throughout the day. My brother-in-law Top, has a young man who is sixteen coming to the house to work the property all day. Top has always worked well with young men and is a strong mentor while teaching them life skills. I think this comes from his time in the Marines when he and his fellow marines had to watch over each other for their very survival. Susan baked bread and later I hung all her pictures she's wanted to get up on the walls. 
 When dinner time arrived I found that we would have to have ribeye steaks again because the freezer door had been left open and they had thawed. It was my pleasure to assist with that problem.

It is day 57 of my thru/ hike and on this day of my great adventure, I went shopping with my sister for granite countertops and major appliances. 
 Susan has had enough of the 1980's appliances in her new home, so she took me with her today to research the new ones she would be ordering. Hey, what else am I going to do?  And besides, I had the opportunity to spend time with my sister and the best part is that we ate shrimp Po Boys at a roadside food truck stand. Well, maybe the best part was spending quality time with my sister...
 Tomorrow is looking like a kayak paddle day. Susan is a paddling freak and has a collection of some of the top kayaks produced. She is an avid paddler and competes in some of the major races throughout North America. In fact, I will be her ground support in next year's Yukon river quest which starts in Whitehorse and ends in Dawson City, making it a 444 mile race and known to be the world's longest canoe and kayak race.  
 I myself am a kayak novice which places me in the position of great respect for her abilities in the sport. I will post tomorrow with how our outing has gone. 
 In the meantime, I wanted to give a brief update on my feet and shin splints. I've seen a huge improvement starting yesterday.  I also visited an Outfitter for a different pair of trail runners as the other pair I purchased just didn't feel right. My new shoes are the Altra Lone Peak 3.0 which have a great reputation on the trail; they have a wider toe box and flat sole. The other shoes that I've only hiked in for two days are made by Oboz and they have a rolled side sole that had me constantly rolling my ankles (a future accident waiting to happen).

Susan came over to the guest house this morning with morning coffee for the two of us. We sat and planned our day of kayaking. We needed to move the carrier from her Jeep to Top's vehicle first and then load the two boats we would be paddling.  Once we gathered the paddles, PFDs, safety equipment and snacks we were on our way. The weather was absolutely perfect for a leisurely paddle, barely a ripple on the water and virtually no other activity such as speeding motor boats.  Susan took the opportunity to do some sprints as part of her training regimen. I, on the other hand, took it easy and just enjoyed the peacefulness the water had to offer ( I am not in training for a race). We paddled the length of the lake and after about four hours loaded the boats and headed back to the house. 
 Tomorrow is a work day for us. Susan will work in her vegetable garden, Top is always working on something, and I am going to do some minor carpentry work on Susan's closets.

In fact, I finally ""hit the wall"", staying up way too late while really enjoying my time with Susan and Top. Most nights getting only five or six hours of sleep after playing, eating, drinking, and working all day.  So today I woke up late and took an afternoon nap which is not something I ever do.  I skipped Susan's luncheon that she had put together for their friend Betty at her insistence.  No argument from me, the sleep was amazing.  We did go to the ballgame and sat in the Mercedes Benz sky box that included great food and a relaxing night.  We were home and I was in bed before 10:00. Tomorrow is another ""work"" day, hooking up Susan's stereo, installation of Top's air conditioner in his shop, and bringing the Christmas decorations up to the attic.

What a difference a week makes...
I thought sleeping in my rental car was a good idea, but it was awful. I pulled into the Enterprise parking lot and picked a secluded parking spot.  I pulled my sleeping quilt out of my pack, climbed into the back seat, and found it impossible to get comfortable. I finally fell asleep after one in the morning, but woke up at 3:30 and couldn't get back to sleep. I hiked all day like a zombie.  I kept tripping over my own feet and actually half considered laying down on the trail for a nap.  Speaking of the trail, the manager at Enterprise checked in my rental before they were even open and had one of his associates drive me to the trail head.  I had my Shenandoah National Park permit filed and was hiking by 8:00 AM. Unlike the Great Smokies National Park, SNP does not charge a fee for your permit, but they will fine you if you don't have one. I was so appreciative of the easy conditions the trail offered up today as well. I will tell you that eight days off the trail made for some "" soft"" legs, but the biggest difference I noticed was in my lung capacity.  Twenty miles was still a good first day back and I really didn't want to over do it anyway. 
 While filling out my permit I heard someone call out my name.  I turned around and found ""Flutter"" standing behind me. I was really surprised to see her after my extended leave as I would have thought I'd not see anyone I knew again.  It turns out that she and ""Onion"" had been off the trail because of an ankle injury ""Onion"" sustained. She was a strong hiker, but unfortunately is off the trail for good.  
 I did meet and hiked pretty much all day with ""Scooby"". ""Scooby"" started on March 13th and is making really good time. Not sure I'll be able to continue at his pace as he is six foot six and has some seriously long legs... we'll see how it goes tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I'm still having an issue with shin splints in my right leg.  
 A couple of observations I have made since being gone for over a week is how lush the forest is now.  It has really filled in.  Also, there are butterflies everywhere... you simply can't believe how many of these flying flowers there are... just so beautiful. 
 We have also traded the Blue Ridge Parkway for the Skyline Drive.  In fact, the trail follows Skyline Drive so closely that I crossed it nine times today. 
 Tonight's temperatures are going to be close to freezing... of course I have already sent all my winter gear home... I guess I'll have to snuggle up to a bear.  
 Tomorrow's hiking conditions look somewhat similar (based on my guide book) to today's.

Up early for oatmeal and coffee... I was packed and hiking by 7:00.  I felt great and the trail was kind to me once again... I love the Shenandoah's.  I hiked pretty much all day with ""Scooby"", ""Flutter"", and ""Hodgepodge "". You tend to hike apart and meet up again all day as everyone has their own pace.  We met for lunch at Loft Mountain Campground where I think we all ate too much... couldn't help it, the food was too plentiful and so good.  
 While hiking early this morning, I met Chip and Emily hiking together. They are a father/daughter duo section hiking for a week which is something they do together every year.  What great memories they are making together.  You can see their picture in my photo gallery. 
 A couple of differences from what I've seen on the trail compared to Shenandoah National Park is the unique way finding posts. All way finding signs up to this point have been made of wood, which to be honest, does show its wear over time. The signs here are concrete posts with steel bands and an embossed directory on each one (photo in my gallery). The other difference is the shelters are called huts in SNP. The park is neat, clean, and well organized.  The Loft Mountain Campground was impeccable. The camp store was run like a major concern... bathrooms and showers looked like they belonged to a fine resort.  A real class act and proof that this government agency is making good use of the tax payers dollars.

I was in my tent and sound to sleep by 8:00 last night for being just plain worn out as I was up at 5:00 and on the trail by 6:45. There were a few pretty good climbs, but overall the trail was kind.  I hiked pretty much all day with ""Scooby"" and we both took full advantage of all the park has to offer. SNP has a number of camp grounds throughout the park and the trail skirts right along them.  That of course means FOOD... Today's stops included Lewis Mountain Campground and Cabins.  I had a cold beer to wash down my corn chips.  ""Scooby"" had ice cream and a box of cookies.  Our next stop was eight miles up the trail.  Big Meadows Lodge has what they call a Wayside. Waysides are restaurants that are for tourists and work out pretty well for thru-hikers too. They are also known for their blackberry shakes.  It's a thru-hiker tradition to partake in this shake.  I had mine with an of order fries.  I think I'm actually gaining weight!  While having our dinner at camp tonight, ""Scooby"" and I discovered that another Wayside is just a four mile hike in the morning and they open at 8:00.  We'll be leaving at 6:30 and should be there when they unlock the doors... I see a big breakfast in my future... no Pop-tarts tomorrow.  Unfortunately, the weather forecast is calling for rain for the next several days.

 What a thunderstorm we had last night.  It rained and thundered so violently, it shook the mountain I was camping on. Funny thing though... ""Scooby"" never heard it. The storm broke right at 6:00 and the radar showed that we would have a break for a couple of hours before the next band rolled in. ""Scooby"" and I had boots on the trail at exactly 6:30 and made tracks for the Skyland Wayside. We made the 4.2 miles in 1 hour 37 minutes.  This Wayside is beautiful; a full service restaurant, a fire going in the fireplace, linen tablecloths and napkins, and us walking in like the dredges of the earth. They actually sat us on the far side of the dining room. That's OK... there was a breakfast buffet... they lost money on us. 
 ""Scooby"" wanted to get moving (I think to work off his three full breakfast plates) and left the Wayside at 9:30. I waited another 15 minutes when I saw the rain slow down.  I caught up with him at Byrds Nest #3 Hut where we had lunch (a very light lunch). That's when we decided to pound out another twelve miles to the next and last Wayside in the park. They closed at 5:30 so we really had to bust them out.  Yep, we made it there by 5:00 pm and enjoyed cheeseburgers and fries. 
 About today's hike... not a lot to say really.  It was wet and foggy all day. I felt pretty good about my feet and the new shoes. Sure, they were soaked but not as bad as they have been in the past.  I've got them stuffed with paper towels I got from the Wayside and new dry socks for in the morning. Unfortunately, it looks like rain again tomorrow. 
 I am a bit disappointed that I'll be out of the Shenandoah's soon and have yet to see a bear.  Every squirrel and every chipmunk has me stop dead in my tracks... I just started calling them baby bears.  ""Scooby"" saw one, at least he claims he did.  No picture, no scratches/claw marks leaves it a bit suspect. He did take a picture of where the bear had been... well there you have it.  
 A couple of other things that I've noticed these last couple of days is that the wild flowers are really abundant and varied now.  Splashes of color line the trail... it's just beautiful. And also, I've been seeing a lot of golden finches. I have always loved that bird.

 So, the rest of the story...
 When we, ""Scooby"" and I were making tracks for Elkwallow Wayside yesterday, ""Scooby"" mentions how awful it would be if the Wayside closed at 5:00.  I tell him that my guide says open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 9:00 am -7:30 pm.  We were almost running to get our burger and fries at the last Wayside in the Shenandoah's.  We arrived at 5:00  to a sign that read their hours are 9:00 to 5:30... just made it. The rest of the story is that we were cold and very wet with very limited options for camping anywhere close.  I figured that as a tax payer, they wouldn't mind if we stealth camped behind the Wayside. Actually, ""they"" would mind so the story I came up with was as follows... Hello Mr. Park Ranger.  Yes, we are aware that camping here is not permitted.  But sir, we were so cold and wet that we felt hypothermia coming on and feared for our lives.  We knew it would be understood why we camped illegally. Thank you for your understanding.  Fortunately, the Park Rangers have enough sense to not go out in the rain. 
 The plan for today was to get into Front Royal to the Terrapin Station Hostel where my sister has a drop box waiting. ""Scooby"" agreed that he could use a night inside where it is warm and dry and agreed to hike there with me.  
 We arrived by 1:30, showered and took care of laundry by 3:00...now what do I do?
 I know, let's go through my sisters drop box. Susan's mail drop boxes are something I covet and will run down the trail for (no wonder I get shin splints). So this box had chocolate covered walnuts, dill pickles, gourmet trail mix, Pez dispenser (yes, you read correctly), mini bottle of Glenlivet (I love my sister), prepackaged gourmet dinners with recipe included, bacon jerky (touchdown), macadamia nuts (she sent these because they are high in fat) and various other goodies too numerous to mention.  
 Bear update... as we were starting out this morning ""Scooby"" stops dead in his tracks and points to a bear... nope, I didn't see it as I was too busy looking down at my feet. So, did ""Scooby"" actually see a bear?  No pictures, no scratch/claw marks on him... hmm, a little suspect.
 To end today's post, I feel compelled to mention that hiking through the Shenandoah National Park was a true pleasure. The trails are beautifully maintained, the way finding was clear and easy to follow and the Wayside food options were greatly appreciated.  I, like most thru hikers, will miss the Shannies.

Terrapin Station Hostel ended up being a pretty good place. A bunk, shower, laundry, frozen pizza and pop for thirty bucks. Mike (the owner) also provided us with a free shuttle into the town of Front Royal.  Nobody actually needed a resupply because everyone had pretty much eaten at the Shenandoah Waysides leaving food bags still full. We did accept Mike's recommendation for dinner though.  ""Pave-mint"" is an old converted gas station now run as a pub with great food and a terrific beer selection, just what I needed after the terrible weather we have encountered these last couple of days. On the way home ""Scooby"" asked Mike if he could swing by McDonald's for a Big Mac (his second dinner); I got a vanilla cone. Back at the Hostel, we were all warm and dry while it continued to rain all night. 
 ""Scooby"" and I were up early with big plans for hiking on toward Harpers Ferry. Our goal was to push on and to put down a big miles day.  The challenge was that the trail was in awful condition.  To start, it was obvious that we were no longer in Shenandoah National Park where those trails were groomed and in ideal shape for its visitors. And of course the rains contributed to poor and let's just say unfavorable hiking conditions. Mud the consistency of thick pudding and river/mini lakes on the trail requiring us to hop, skip, jump or just wading through made for slow and dangerous hiking. My primary objective was to remain upright although I failed just once with a slip and fall in the slick mud. Attempts at keeping your shoes/feet dry was futile. It actually got to the point that you marched right through the mess. Honestly, what was going to happen? Once you were soaked you can't get any wetter. It was actually freeing and liberating to wade your way through.  It was also slow going as well, so we didn't get to our destination until just after 8:00. I was so hungry, but also so focused on getting ""there"". The good news is that we only have thirty mile to Harpers Ferry and will get there early Monday. ""Scooby "" had a single room booked for himself at an inn, but was able to call and change it to a double for us to share.  Harpers Ferry is home to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and although not the exact halfway point, it tends to be the psychological halfway point. They will take your picture and give you your new number as a thru- hiker.  I was number 394 when I left Georgia and am anxious to know where I fall now.  The ATC is also where my dear trail angel /Mother-In-Law has a drop box waiting for me.

""Scooby"" and I agreed that we would get a bit of a later start today since we got in so late last night.  So instead of 6:30, we started our hiking at 7:30.  Today's hike would primarily consist of a fourteen mile section called ""The Rollercoaster"". It gets this name because of the constant and repetitive ascents and descents, most of which are extremely steep. This was a very challenging section with virtually no views worth mentioning, but it was made so much more palatable with the 1,000 mile mark at the peak of one of these mountains. 
 Another milestone today was met by our completing Virginia which makes up 544 miles of the AT.  I now have the fourth of fourteen states left safely behind me. 
 One highlight of the day was when we got to mile number 1,002 and hiked a short .1 miles to the Bears Den Hostel. This property is owned and operated by the ATC and is really beautiful. We did stop in for a couple of sodas and chatted with a couple thru-hikers that were staying there.  If we had timed it right I know we would have stayed.  But, we had more miles to go for our daily goal.  When we did arrive at the shelter tonight we were the only ones there. I'm taking my chances that no one else shows (you know how I am about the snoring in the shelters) and am set up in this beautiful shelter. It has a front porch, porch swing and is very clean. We will wake up in the morning and start hiking the nine miles into Harpers Ferry.  I am really looking forward to this additional milestone and especially as it will be a short day of hiking as well.

So I ended up with the shelter to myself and got an amazing night of sleep. We were up at 5:15 and on the trail at 6:30 for our 9.4 mile hike into the historic town and home to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters, Harpers Ferry. What a picturesque little town.  We are staying at Town's Inn directly in the center of town and within walking distance (every place is within walking distance for a thru-hiker) of all local attractions (that's code for restaurants). 
 We arrived at about 10:00 AM and made our first stop the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters. The ATC will take your picture and give you your number that indicates your place in this years ""class"" of thru-hikers. My starting number at Amicalola Falls on March 5th was number 394 and my number today was 216. A side note here is that the folks at the ATC were remarkable. They are so welcoming and friendly and really have a passion for what they do. 
 While at the ATC, I also picked up a mail drop package that my mother-in-law had waiting for me.  There is really nothing better than receiving a package from family and friends... thank you Mom!!!
 We checked into our room and went for lunch, the post office, laundry and resupply for incidentals (that's code for beer).  Oh, by the way, Papa John's delivers...
 My only concern is that our Inn is very close to the Harpers Ferry train station... a VERY active train station. I don't have a copy of the schedule but five have passed in to last two hours.  Will they run all night?  We'll see...

Backing up to yesterday and the heavy train traffic of trains running through Harpers Ferry... They seemed to run all day and night and in both directions but honestly, no big deal as they didn't really disturb my sleeping (I guess they aren't as loud as someone snoring). I have to admit that I had no idea that there was so much train activity in the US. All along the trail and throughout the small towns I have been through I've seen and heard more trains than I had ever expected.  It really is almost comforting and nostalgic to see and to hear them coming and going.   
""Scooby"" and I decided that we would have an early breakfast at the Town's Inn cafe at 7:00 and do the short stint of the AT that circles Harpers Ferry. So, let me try to explain. When we arrived yesterday our main objective was to get to the ATC. We got off the trail at the southern end. The trail could be picked up on the northern end through the town, but would have meant that we ""skipped"" some of the trail.  Even though it is the same distance, we are both committed to not skipping a single ""white blaze"". This a purest approach to hiking the trail, but the approach we both agree on. 
 After the short hike, we went back to the Inn and ordered sandwiches from the coffee/ice cream/bakery/sandwich shop across the street from our Inn. Connie prepared two of the biggest sandwiches I had ever seen. These were placed into our packs and off we went.  The trail was very kind to us with limited ascents, but there were a few good miles of foot bruising rocks that can slow you down.  We stopped at Ed Garvey Shelter to eat those sandwiches at about 1:00 and I felt as though I had been put into a food coma. Thank you Connie!!!  
 The rest of today's hike took us past/through Gathland State Park and the beautiful views of White Rock Cliff. Both of these sites were worthy and timely for a hike break and snack.  One thing about Maryland is that you must camp at a designated camp site. This can be at one of their shelters or state run campgrounds. In other words, no stealth camping which is fine because they do provide really nice facilities for campers and backpackers. Our final destination for the evening was Dahlgren Backpack Campground. This is a Maryland state run campground complete with great tent sites, picnic tables, fire rings, bathrooms with hot showers (a shower two days in a row?). All this for no fee... thank you Maryland... wish we were staying in your state longer, but unfortunately only 41 miles of the AT runs through this state. Rich in civil war history and home to the original Washington Monument (which we will see tomorrow), Maryland is definitely going to have me revisit in the future. 
 Milestone for the day... West Virginia, state number five is safely behind me.

Trail angel Vickie made contact with me this morning via my trail journal guestbook. As a section hiker and self proclaimed trail angel, she graciously offered to meet me and ""Scooby"" with sub sandwiches and other goodies.  Coordinating our meeting was pretty easy because she provides trail magic often and knows where the trail crosses local roads. Vickie brought us Italian subs from her favorite deli, soda, beer, fresh fruit and brownies that she baked this morning. Thank you Vickie for this amazing gift of trail magic and your generosity. 
One of today's highlights was the Washington Monument we stopped at this morning. This stone tower dedicated to the father of our country was built by the villagers/towns people of Boonesboro in 1827.  A large group followed the Stars and Stripes up the mountain on July fourth and started building this impressive monument as part of their independence celebration. Seems a bit more productive than shooting off fireworks and definitely more patriotic than the fighting that takes place between political parties today... It has been restored to its original design and was certified a Maryland and National Monument in 1972.  
 About today's hike... whew!!! It was a tough one for certain. The rocks were stacked on top of rocks, big rocks, little rock's and very pointy rocks.  From what I've read, this is just training for what's to come in Pennsylvania. To top it all off, the heat was oppressive. It remained in the mid eighties all day. It seemed impossible to re-hydrate enough. 
 Another highlight today was the completion of another state.  Maryland has been put safely behind and Pennsylvania miles start getting chipped away at starting tomorrow.

Prior to starting my thru-hike, I asked my daughter-in-laws if I could have something that belongs to my grandchildren to take with me.  My thoughts were to have something that could photobomb the sights along the way.  Sarah provided me with a laminated copy of my favorite picture of my grandson Brantley. Lauren gave me Princess Poppy, which is a shared toy troll/doll belonging to my granddaughters, Blakely and Katy Ellis. It's been fun and helpful in making my journey a little bit inclusive of my grandchildren for sure.  Cross from one state to another, photobomb time.  A national monument, photobomb... Anyway, the photo at the left is another example. 
 We literally stepped over the Maryland/Pennsylvania border last night and pitched our tents.  It's a psycological head game to be able to go ""check"" to  another state down. Now all we have to do is hike the 229 miles that make there way through the Keystone state.  Well, 6:30 this morning was a good time to start. We actually targeted twelve miles by noon, but achieved thirteen miles by noon (such overachievers). We stopped for lunch at the the Rocky Mountain Shelters (yes, plural as there have been twin shelters at each Pennsylvania shelter locations. Snoring and no snoring?). While there I was looking at my guide and noticed that there was a restaurant just over three miles away. ""Scooby"" and I had just finished lunch so it would soon be time for ""second"" lunch. Visions of cold soda, burgers and ice cream messed with our sensibilities. Timbers Restaurant was a short half mile walk along state road 30 and well worth our time and effort. The owner (Wanda) made us feel so welcome. Our Pepsi glasses never went dry. Our food portions were huge and the cost was VERY reasonable. Hiker hint: do not miss this place... charging station, ice cream, great food and even better prices. 
 Tomorrow we will arrive at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Pine Grove had at one time been the actual halfway mark for the trail, but over time the trail has to be moved so the halfway point did as well. Anyway, an old time tradition that exists still is to get a half gallon of ice cream from the general store and consume it in a single sitting. Half way, half gallon... ""Scooby"" has made this challenge one of his goals for his thru-hike. If you complete the challenge you get a commemorative wooden spoon (a tiny wooden spoon... wow! Right?). I'm still on the fence.  I'll let you know which side of that fence I fall on/over tomorrow.

When in Rome...
As I mentioned yesterday, I was pretty sure I wouldn't be taking on the half gallon ice cream challenge.  All I can say is that the heat and the miles hiked helped sway my decision making abilities. It was almost too easy... 
 Our hike into Pine Grove Furnace State Park started at 6:45 this morning.  ""Scooby "" likes for me to take the lead and I find it keeps me moving knowing he's on my tail.  We hit fourteen miles by noon today... now that's the power of ice cream.  When we arrived there was no question as to whether or not I would participate in this tradition. The only decision was what flavor?  I went with Neapolitan and it went down fast. I finished in about twenty minutes and actually beat ""Scooby"". Because ice cream now comes in one and a half quart containers, you are also required to finish a pint container... no problem!!!  Oh, and I got my tiny wooden spoon to prove it.  
 A bit about Pine Grove Furnace State Park...
It is difficult to believe that this now beautiful state park was home to an iron furnace that dumped byproducts/waste into the waters and environment with no consideration to the damage it caused.  Built in the late 18th century using the methods used four hundred years earlier this furnace produced iron for our mechanical/industrial age. Hey... that's progress!!!  
 In addition to the remaining furnace structure there is now a clean pond for swimming, museum and picnic areas. This park is also home to the Appalachian Trail Museum, a must do for hikers of all ages.  I loved a quote of Benton MacKaye (forester, planner and conservationist who's idea created the AT) that I've seen before and once again today...

This weekend is the weekend that Damascus, Virginia holds its annual Trail Days Festival. This three day event draws hikers off the trail and a huge number of alumni there as well. It's been great fun hearing everyone's plans regarding how they were going to get there. Some of those familiar faces have not been seen yesterday or today so it's clear that they've gone south.  I myself can't see going backwards to a place I had been weeks ago and ""Scooby"" agreed. We have discussed possibly coming back next year as alumni.  We'll see how that goes over with our wives...
 ""Scooby"" and I got off at our usual 6:30 starting time with plans for a big miles day. Southern Pennsylvania has been pretty good to us and the weather has really been cooperating. In fact, it never left the fifties today. It was a perfect day for hiking. 
 One of the hiker pleasures is that the trail will actually go straight through or very close to a small town from time to time. When this occurs, you are compelled and drawn in for a visit. Such an occasion presented itself today. The trail meanders through the streets of the quaint town of Boiling Springs. While walking through we saw small children fishing with grandparents along the shore of the town center lake. We saw beautiful public parks and green spaces, band stand and historic buildings with plaques describing/explaining their significance to this proud community. The only thing missing was Norman Rockwell and his easel. We stopped and asked for a suggestion for lunch and were directed to Cafe 101... my oh my... the food was incredible. While there I chatted a bit with a woman and her young daughter, (the husband/ father showed up a bit later). After lunch I asked the woman if she knew of a drug store where I might pick up a knee brace (a twitch developed in my right knee giving me a little concern). Sure she said, it's a few miles away, ""I'll drive you there"".  I was stunned by her gracious and generous response. Anyway, my new friend, Trail Angel Lou, left her husband and daughter at Cafe 101 and shuttled Whistler to the local Rite Aid. The funny thing was that I could tell her husband was accustomed to his wife offering random gifts of kindness from the expression and kind smile on his face.  It was that look of pride and ""sure, that's my wife... isn't she awesome""? I know that look because I wear it all the time when I'm around my wife.  How blessed are we to be among angels???  
 So, back to hiking (this is a trail journal after all).  While hiking today I ran into a young man I had not seen since Damascus. He happens to go by the trail name ""Whistler"". How can this be?  I'm Whistler!!!  Well it's not uncommon to share a trail name.  ""Scooby has learned that there are currently three ""Scooby's"" on the trail. Anyway, ""Whistler Jr."" is a nice young man and I enjoy our bantering as to who is the original/true ""Whistler "" (it's me by the way).

 I awoke this morning and realized that I failed to mention a very different experience while hiking.  We hiked yesterday for nearly thirteen miles through farm fields. We hiked through wheat that was nearly three feet tall. It was beautifully lush and although not ""amber waves of grain"", it was a beautiful green and it did wave in the light breezes of the day. There was corn just coming up in rows that went on for as far as we could see. It was a nice break from the seclusion of the shaded forest we've become so accustomed to.  The surprising thing was how difficult it was to walk that long on flat ground.  I actually couldn't wait to climb another mountain. 
 Our first destination today was the small river town of Duncannon.  We needed to get laundry done, pick up a mail drop, and visit ""The Doyle"" for one of their famous burgers and a cold beer. The Doyle is part of the lost Americana of yesteryear. It was obviously a beautiful building in its day with lots of architectural features you would expect from a turn of the century hotel. Unfortunately, the town of Duncannon has, like so many other small towns, fallen on tough times.  It is extremely depressed and for what ever economy might still exist there, it's not enough to sustain and support such a grand building. It remains a hiker friendly restaurant and ""hotel"", but hiker season is just a few months a year. Rooms are $25-$35 a night which is a good value, but you're not getting much for that. My hope is that it can somehow survive, but in the meantime I'm pleased to have been able to enjoy this traditional AT stop while on my journey. 
 We left Duncannon at 2:30 this afternoon with hopes of adding some miles to the ten it took to get to town. The rocks of Pennsylvania revealed themselves today so we stopped after five miles out. We thought it best to start with fresh legs (and feet) tomorrow. We knew it was coming, but we now know why hikers call it ""Rocksylvania"". These rocks have cutting edges on them. We understand that the worst part of ""Rocksylvania"" will be northern Pennsylvania... can't wait.

We had a great time talking over dinner and honestly thought we would leave in the morning with him still asleep.  Well morning came and ""Downhill"" was up and ready to hike with two old fellows.  The weather was perfect with cloud cover and temperatures in the high fifties and low sixties. The elevations and terrain were perfect for laying down some big miles so the three of us went at it hard. It was a bit rocky early in the day, but clear trails for the better part of the 28 miles we put safely behind us. While crossing over a highway we did spy trail magic up ahead... bananas!!!  Thank you trail angel who ever you are.  
When we finally stopped for the evening, ""Downhill"" ate dinner with us, but decided he was too close to having hiked thirty miles to quit.  He threw his pack on his back and hiked on to get his thirty mile day.  Not me nor ""Scooby ""... we were satisfied with what we achieved not to mention that we were truly done.   So I've had a gentleman that has been following me on Trail Journals who sent a couple messages via the guestbook.  He goes by the trail name 'Rokk' and he let me know that he would be doing a section hike and would try to catch up to us. Well he just now (8:00 pm) found us and made camp here as well.  We will all hike on together tomorrow.

We hike thirteen miles into Port Clinton by 11:30 (""Rokk"" was a bit behind and had not arrived yet). This little sleepy town is home to a pretty large train yard, but it is obviously a bit depressed. The census report on line show a dramatic decrease in population. But, it's a cute little town and one worth visiting if you are hiking or driving through. I understand that coal mining is still a major economic driver for this area and still provides jobs and keeps the trains that run through this town very productive.  AWOL's guide mentions the Peanut Store which to me is code for snacks.  When we entered the store we were in a state of shock.  This store is practically in the middle of nowhere, but was full floor to ceiling with every candy you could ever imagine. We were like kids in a candy store (literally). The clerk, Kate, told us that people will drive from as far as Philadelphia to get their favorite candy. Oh, their best seller is their fresh roasted peanuts. After we satisfied our sweet tooth, we walked next door to the Port Clinton Hotel for lunch.  ""Scooby"" and I ordered our lunch when ""Rokk"" arrived along with another gentleman named Don. Don is in his 70's and met ""Rokk"" when he was offering trail magic. So, ""Rokk""  decides he is going to buy Don lunch to show his appreciation. He doesn't stop there either. He insisted on buying my lunch and ""Scooby's"" as well.  Incidentally, the food at this place is off the charts good. The hamburger is probably one of the best on the trail. ""Rokk's"" two days of hiking with us was over and his wife Peggy was on her way to pick him up. He admits it was tough keeping up with us, but I was personally impressed with how well he did... a real trooper, great trail angel and fun to be around. Thank you ""Rokk"" for spending a couple days on the trail with us. 
 Back to Don...After lunch, Don took us to his car and loaded us up with more trail magic, snacks, drinks, and cheese. We were all set to knock off another thirteen miles. 
 If you've been following my journal you will remember when I broke one of my trekking poles on Blood Mountain. After coming off Blood Mountain you come to Mountain Crossing Outfitters at Neels Gap. The clerk there told me that the manufacturer would warranty my broken pole. My response was why would I do that?  It wasn't defective, I fell and broke it... not their fault. I'm giving this background information to set up this next story. A special treat to myself on this trip was the purchase of a Sea to Summit blow up pillow.  It cost me around $45, but was well worth it for my sleeping comfort. A few weeks ago I noticed it was leaking. Most recently (now), I'm having to blow it up six to eight times a night.  I decided that I needed it replaced by Sea To Summit. All I did was put my head on it each night (what you'd expect, right?). Annie has all the purchase info at home so I asked her to reach out to them. After a number of calls and emails the associate at Sea to Summit, we'll call him Jacob, (because that's his name) sent me an email asking me to take the pillow, inflate the pillow, place the pillow in a basin of water, take a picture of where the bubbles are coming from, and then email the picture of the air bubbles to him.   Not a joke... he was serious.  For the record, he knew I was on the trail as a thru-hiker (highly unlikely that I'd have a basin in my backpack). So, I called again from somewhere along mile number 1,200 on the AT in the middle of nowhere. This time the person that answers the phone, we'll call her Brie, (because that's her name) listens to me (key word is listens) and agrees that they need to get me a new pillow. A short time later I got an email from Jacob... pillow in route.  
 FYI, I'll be off the trail for five days starting Friday to attend my niece's high school graduation. Annie and I are actually honorary Aunt and Uncle to Ashley who we've known and loved before she was born. I'll also have a couple days to see my sons and their families as well. Oh, about ""Scooby"", he's going to hike on for two days and then he too will be off the trail. He and his wife will be taking a five day vacation. I'll come back two days before his return, catch up to where he left off, and will continue with him once he is back. As always, I'll continue to journal while I'm off the trail.

""Scooby "" and I agreed on a 7:00-7:15 departure time after having had hiked so hard and late yesterday. When I woke at 4:00 am to the sound of a heavy rain I just knew it was going to be ugly today. My best defense was to roll over and go back to sleep. When I was up and about, I prepared my instant grits (I hate them), and waited for either the rain to slow/stop or for ""Scooby "" to start making some positive movements. When neither happened I just pulled it together and packed my pack. We were both ready and hit the trail by 7:15. The thirteen miles we needed to do would have and should have been easy, but the the rain made them miserable. Climbing over rocks the size of basketballs and up to the size of a small car is tough enough, but add the element of rain... it's double tough. ""Scooby "" fell first and I followed suit. The rocks are tough enough, but add some rain and they can get crazy slippery. My hands had turned into shriveled prunes and I was loosing feelings in my fingers. I was so cold that my teeth were chattering (and we call this fun). At one point there was a break in the rain and I let ""Scooby"" know that I had to eat something, I needed fuel.  Two minutes after a quick snack it was pouring again.  We finally came to a break in the rocks and I found myself running with ""Scooby"" right on my heels. It felt good to make up some time after the slow crawls over those stinking rocks. At one point we had figured it would be 2:00 before we'd arrive at our B&B, Blue Mountain Summit, but the running we did got us there at 12:30. In our room, hot shower, dressed in warm clothes... we were ready for hiker burgers and beer.

Up at 5:30 even while in a comfortable bed in a clean warm room,  ""Scooby "" and I were ready to hike this morning, but I wasn't going anywhere.  We had a great breakfast at our B&B and washed it all down with plenty of fresh coffee.  I'm waiting on Enterprise to pick me up while ""Scooby "" is ready to hike on. It felt really strange to me to watch him go while I stayed behind.  The good news is that he'll run reconnaissance for me and provide hiker data... not that it really matters because it is what it is.  I just like knowing what's up ahead.  
 I am really excited to know that I'll see my sons and their beautiful families.  Just thinking about them brings real tears to my eyes. My only wish is that I could see Annie as well.  For that, I have to get back on the trail and move my little legs as fast as I can.

I really don't know what to say. I've known this young lady since before she was born and today I'm watching her walk across a stage to accept her high school diploma. How did this happen?  It was an honor to see Ashley accept her just reward for all her hard work, but the greatest honor was to be present as part of her family.  Her father, Steve, is like a brother to me and her mother, Barbie, is so dear to me.  I can remember the Mother's Day at church when they announced Barbie was pregnant. This couple tried to have children for twelve years and had given up hope.  The Lord obviously had big plans for them though and blessed them with Ashley.  Steve and Barbie have been honorary aunt and uncle to our boys. They lead the youth Sunday school class for our oldest son Richard. We've shared so many family celebrations together that being here for Ashley's graduation was so ""natural"".  
 Ashley will be attending Columbia College on a swimming scholarship that she has earned through hard work and perseverance. This, not surprising at all when you know how she was raised. God blessed this couple with this little girl and Annie and I have been blessed to watch her grow into the beautiful person she is today.  We are truly blessed!!!

It was another wonderful day me. I woke up a bit late as the after graduation celebrations continued late at the Sawyer house.  When we were all up Steve made his typical breakfast which is usually enough for the whole neighborhood. After breakfast I said my goodbyes and made off to see my son Brian and his family in North Charleston. Our plan was to grab lunch together, but believe it or not, I wasn't that hungry. I'm not sure if it was because I've not hiked for a couple of days or that I was still full from Steve's huge breakfast.  We went to a local hamburger joint call Sesame's and I skipped the burger and had a salad.  After lunch we went back to their home, hung out and caught up a bit.  I was back on the road and heading for Lexington by mid afternoon. It has been such a blessing to spend this time with my family.

 Am I ever going to miss this time I've had with my family. Today started a bit early as I had made plans to meet with a colleague/friend that I had not seen in the ten years since I had retired. Phil has most recently retired from Publix Supermarkets with he and his wife, Vonnie, building a home here in Lexington. We met this morning over coffee and got as caught up as we could in the one and a half hours we spent together.  
We parted with the promise to see each other over the holidays when Annie and I are back visiting our family.  
 The rest of this glorious day was mostly spent with my son, Richard. We ran a couple errands, had lunch and caught a movie together. Once we got home I started getting my gear together and pack for my early morning departure and the nearly seven hundred mile drive back to Pennsylvania.  As I said, it's been a great visit. My daughter-in-law, Lauren, fed me as if on a personal mission to put some weight back on my bones. She and my granddaughters baked brownies and cookies for me. I did my best to show my appreciation the best way I know how... I ate them like a starving hiker, but left just enough for them.

Knowing that I had a 650 mile drive this morning motivated me to have everything packed and ready to go last night.  I had the pleasure of saying goodnight to my granddaughters and then sat up a bit talking with Richard and Lauren.

I arrived at Enterprise just after 4:00 and they had me back to the trail head just before 5:00.  It's funny how I got off the trail last Thursday with ""Scooby "" in the pouring rain and it looks like it never stopped.  I wanted to get a few miles behind me so I did 5.9 to the Bake Oven Knob Shelter. It was slow going for the rain and some really big rock climbs, slippery wet rock climbs.

 This was one of those days that was so full that I hope I can remember everything. 
 To start, I started early knowing that I wanted to lay down some big miles. I was just about a mile out of camp when I came up on a woman that seemed happy to see me. Her name is ""Energizer"" and apparently she wasn't sure if she was going north on the trail or not. She told me that "" the rocks all looked familiar"".  I'll second that... I assured her that she was indeed going north. 
 The rain this morning made for very difficult hiking especially since I was hiking some of the most difficult terrain I had experienced yet. The climb out of Lehigh gap is a vertical rock and boulder climb that requires two hands and two feet... no place here for trekking poles. This mountain side is a deforested ridge left from the days of zinc smelting from 1898 through 1980. It's not the prettiest mountain but it was a fun challenging climb. 
 My reward for the climb was two fold. The first was trail magic left by Grace, trail name ""Earthling"". Grace is a 2015 through hiker alumni and was out for a day hike.  The second was my first bear sighting.  It had just stopped raining and I had just finished my big climb when I started hiking the ridge. I came up and over a hump and saw the bear on the trail walking towards me. As soon as he saw me he turned and started to run on all fours. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get my phone out fast enough to get a picture. That's when he stopped, turned to face me and got on his hind legs. I swear it looked as though he realized it was just me.  It looked as though he was getting ready to ask, ""Is that you Whistler?  I almost didn't recognize you.""  I got my pictures and he turned and ran off. I was so excited I felt like a child, but I didn't care. The first thing I did was call Annie.  I think she thought I was attacked by the bear.  The next thing I did was send the picture to ""Scooby"".  
  A short time later I met ""Jem"". ""Jem"" is a section hiker that had done well over half the trail and a pleasure to speak with. I sat down where she had been resting and made myself some lunch. When I told her my name she told me she had seen and read my journal. Apparently her mother reads it as well. She sent her mom a text and she replied asking if I had my Granddaughters' troll.  I pulled Princess Poppy out and ""Jem"" took a picture of me with Poppy for her mother. Oh, she also wanted to know where ""Scooby"" was... a small world. 
 Speaking of ""Scooby"", I will be meeting him in Delaware Water Gap tomorrow afternoon.  We will start our hiking together on Friday, but I think we might have to have a couple of beers together and catch up first.

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, it's not that the rocks were so bad because they really are... it's just that they never end.  
It's as though they dig holes and plant the rocks... pointy tips up.  Rumor has it that they sneak out after hikers are sleeping soundly in their tents and file the rocks to make sure they keep their boot penetrating edge.
The good news is that we exit Pennsylvania tomorrow and enter The Garden State. My vision is to cross that border, take my shoes off and hike barefoot to Mount Katahdin. Let's see if my vision comes anywhere close to reality. 
 ""Scooby"" and I caught up together just as planned. I got to meet ""Mrs. Scooby"" as well, as an added bonus. After making a resupply run to Wal-Mart we returned to the ""Church of the Mountain"". This church has as part of their outreach a hiker feed every Thursday night (perfect timing). There had to be forty of us hikers and I promise you that none of us left hungry. After dinner I got word of live jazz at the Lions Head pub next to the church.  Could it get any better?  I sent ""Scooby"" a text of the aforementioned and he was quick to get dressed for the occasion. In all, eight of the usual suspects (thru-hikers) joined us for beers and jazz. A perfect send off as we happily exit Pennsylvania.

The plan was to hike out at 6:00 but it rained all night and right into the morning. When 6:00 came around ""Scooby"" sent me a text that his vote was to wait until 7:00 to decide what to do. My text back was that I was in full support. I had no problem rolling over and going back to sleep. Things did start clearing up by 7:00 so we started packing up and hit the trail at 8:00. Fifteen minutes into our hike we crossed the Kinsman Notch parking lot when a car pulled up. A three time AT hiker  ""Left Field"" jumped out of his car and asked if we were thru-hikers. When we replied with an affirmative he pulled out a couple of cold beers for us. Sure, it was only 8:00 in the morning but beer provides lots of nutrients and is actually considered a breakfast beverage in some countries ( I don't know which countries but I heard this somewhere... I think). Anyway, it's my birthday today and I can do whatever I want. ""Left Field"" did offer us another but we passed because we did have mountains to conquer after all. We did accept the candy bars he offered. Candy bars are actually a breakfast food in some countries.  
 On to our hike... it was tough, real tough. The White Mountains are truly living up to their reputation. The boulder climbs are tough enough but throw in all the standing water, ankle high mud and raised creek levels that require cautious fording, your progress is slow... very slow. I had two slip and falls today with no physical harm but a lot of mud to clean up. The climbs require hand over hand at times and it really tests your physical and mental abilities. There were several times that if not for tree roots to grab onto I'm not sure how forward progress could be made. The low mileage day is evidence of this slow advance through the Whites. Our goal is to do our best and to stay healthy.  The big mile days are just going to have to wait for when conditions are right. We are camped at the Kinsman Pond Shelter tonight. This is a AMC run camp with a caretaker and a $10 fee required for tenting. This is the first year that the AMC is experimenting with giving hikers a fifty percent off card with their first stay at one of their club run sites. It is also good for discounts at their huts for snacks and drinks. It sounds like a good deal so we'll see how it works for us. Our plan for tomorrow if all works as planned is to hike five miles to Franconia Notch and either hitch a ride or call for a shuttle to Lincoln where we can resupply then get back to the trail to add on some more miles. Unfortunately, it looks like rain again tomorrow.

What an absolutely beautiful day we had today, a day made just for hiking. We left the Church of the Mountain at 7:00 am this morning. A bit later than we normally leave because we stayed a bit late at the Lions Head Pub the evening before. The beer was cold and the jazz was hot. Delaware Water Gap sure has a lot of talent for such a small community and the Lions Head is a great little venue to showcace these great musicians. We crossed over the Delaware River and half way across was the Pennsylvania/New Jersey border. That's seven states down and seven more to go. 
 It was simply unbelievable how the terrain changed from one state (Pennsylvania) to another (New Jersey). Sure there were still some rocky areas, but nothing close to the misery of the Pennsylvania rocks. 
 Our hike took us to several beautiful vistas today including Sunfish Pond. This pond is a 44 acre glacier lake formed during the last ice age and was recognized as a national natural landmark in 1970. It is stunningly beautiful and especially so because we just haven't seen too many bodies of water in the mountains thus far. It was difficult to take your eyes off it while hiking it's shore. 
 I also stepped right over a rattlesnake today as well. A short fellow of about two feet. ""Scooby"" saw it just before he too stepped on/over it. 
 We took a break this afternoon on top of Rattlesnake Mountain. The views of the Delaware River Valley and the Poconos Mountains were vast. It's amazing how far you can see when it's not raining or foggy.

My/our vision for this morning was for breakfast in Branchville, New Jersey, but everything except for the local bait shop was closed. I had seriously thought about some shiners on a tortilla, but settled for a cold Pepsi to wash down a couple of Pop tarts I had in my food bag. 
 Our primary goal today was to hike into Unionville which happens to be in New York. Confused yet?  Yep... me too. New Jersey and New York share the area that hugs the AT. This is similar to how North Carolina and Tennessee share the AT... one foot in, one foot out.  Anyway, while in Unionville, New York what else would a thru-hiker be expected to do but eat New York style pizza for dinner. There is a reason why New York has their reputation for good pizza... they actually earn it. 
 Oh, another thing about Unionville... yes, it's a small town, but it's a hiker friendly town. They allow thru-hikers to camp at the local park. All that is required is that you register... you do that at the local grocery store. I love small towns. 
 There seems to be an addition to the ""Whistler""-""Scooby"" north bound train to Mount Katahdin.  ""Train Wreck"" joined us today and was a great addition to our trek.  A terrific guy from Alabama, recently retired from thirty plus years with the railroad, ""Train Wreck"" kept pace with us young fellows. He actually started his thru hike on March 23rd, has only had three zeros and at sixty one years old and is a hiking machine who will challenge us every step of the way...

This is one of those small American towns where ""Old Glory"" flies proudly on every telephone pole and in every yard, and red, white and blue bunting billows below windows along main street as though the parade shall pass at any moment. 
 We ate our pizza on the front porch of the local pizzeria last night. After dinner we walked across the street to our tents in the local park.  We agreed that we would get a late start because we wanted a big breakfast in the morning at the local grocery store called Horler's Store.  This little store was open at 7:00 and we found ourselves standing in line to place our orders. They had genuine New York style bagels and doughnuts that were out of this world. ""Scooby"" ate seven of the doughnuts that were the size of tea saucers. ""Train Wreck"" had just two. I had an everything bagel with egg, cheese and Taylor ham and two filled doughnuts. We each also ordered subs to go in our packs for lunch later.  We all agreed that the subs must have had a pound of meat stacked on the rolls. I love New York!!!
 As I mentioned yesterday, we were in and out of New Jersey and New York all day. We will cross from New Jersey and into New York for the last time tomorrow. 
 Our hike today took us over a boardwalk that takes you over a marsh. This boardwalk is just under a mile long and includes a suspension bridge that takes you over Pochuck Creek. The building of these structures had to be a monumental task and sure made our hiking through that area a pleasure.  Immediately after we finished this section we started our steep, rocky and nearly one thousand foot climb up the ""Stairway To Heaven"".  A great challenge and a great way to work off our lunch.  
 We made it an early and short day today both because we got a late start and because we spent the last half of the day hiking in rain.  The plan for tomorrow is to start early and hike close to 28 miles. Unfortunately, it's looking like rain all day.  I hate when that happens!!!

When we arrived at the Wawayanda Shelter last night it was just the three of us so I thought I'd take my chances in the shelter with ""Train Wreck"". ""Scooby"" decided he'd rather sleep in his tent. My objective was to avoid setting up and taking my tent down in the rain. It rained like crazy and I was happy with my decision. 
 We decided to get an early start so began the day at 6:00. We passed the New Jersey/New York border and have left New Jersey safely behind us. That's eight states down and six to go. Our plan for today was to hike 26 miles, but it just didn't work out.  The hiking today was some of the toughest we've experienced thus far. I especially had a difficult day.  I slipped and fell a couple of times on some of the steep declines.  New York has certainly been challenging to say the least. I'm looking forward to a fresh start in the morning. 
 Today was a big day for mosquitoes as they searched for some trail magic of their own in the form of a ""Whistler"" type 0 blood feast. I finally got to break out the Deet that I have carried with me since Springer Mountain. 
 The highlight of our day had to be the ice cream we got at Bellvalle Farms Creamery. It didn't come as a surprise to us when we learned that this ice cream shop is rated number two in the entire United States according to TripAdvisor. I had a two scoop ice cream sundae while both ""Scooby"" and ""Train Wreck"" had banana splits followed up with a milk shake.

We awoke and sat in our tents to the sounds of heavy rain, but our patience paid off as a break in the precipitation allowed us to make a break for it. 
 To give a bit more information on last night, I was so tired and frustrated that I don't think I could have gone any further. I had taken what could have been a hike ending spill, but managed to hop, jump and land on my feet when I took a misstep on a very steep descent. Fortunately, my hiking partners were both in agreement that we needed to call it quits. Our morning hiking proved that it would have been past 9:00 PM before we would have arrived the night before anyway and validating that we made the correct decision. 
 The hiking itinerary for the the day was to hit the trail at 6:30 and make up the rest as we hiked. An iconic landmark on the trail called the ""lemon squeezer"" was one of our early morning challenges. This is an outcropping of two huge boulders that sit at a precarious angle requiring you to manipulate yourself to pass through. Some hikers actually have to remove their backpack to make it through.  We eventually came to Arden Valley Road in the late morning and recalled that there was a state park two tenths of a mile off the trail and our trail guides indicated that this park has vending machines. When we arrived we found candy, soda, and ice cream vending machines. Wait, it gets better...these machines accept credit cards (I love technology). This ended up being a very lucrative stop for the park. With bellies full we marched right back to the trail head and hit it in a serious manner...that is until we got hungry and started planning our next feeding. Careful consideration and planning went into this collective thought process. As it turns out we discovered that between the three of us we actually have one complete brain. The plan was to hike to Bear Mountain Inn, share a room (split three ways is a pretty good deal), order local New York pizza and enjoy it while sitting in the hotel bar. So, it turns out that our collective brain is somewhere around genius level.  Until tomorrow...

The Bear Mountain Inn is a beautiful and historic property. Built in 1915, it has long been a popular escape for New York City dwellers. The Inn is so nice that the three of us agreed that we wouldn't hang our tents on the furniture in the room to dry them out. Unfortunately, the room did take on the odor of three thru-hikers. This smell can only be compared to that of three wet Saint Bernards. The room might need fumigation and removed from the hotel inventory for a while. 
 The pizza we had delivered help substantiate that New York has the best pizza in the world... hands down!!!
 We left the hotel and made our way back to the trail by 7:00. The trail goes directly through the Bear Mountain Zoo, but we were way to early for their 10:30 AM opening and were forced to take the blue blaze trail around the zoo. We made up for our disappointment by hiking the six miles to the Appalachian deli/convenience store for breakfast and subs to go for lunch. Oh, ice cream sandwiches were squeezed in after breakfast too...
 We met up with a couple of guys again today that we had seen trail running yesterday. We crossed paths with them at a cross road where they were meeting with their friend and shuttle driver. Trail magic flowed our way in the form of Coke and cookies.  
 Lastly, I wanted to mention the stone walls we've seen throughout New York. These old dry stack walls are  throughout the forest where we have been hiking these last several days. I know nothing of their origin, but we all took several guesses all day. Were they built to delineate property lines or perhaps for keeping grazing animals?  Who built them? How did they build them and why?  One suggestion I do have is that Pennsylvania should come see what New York has done with their rocks... perhaps they could learn a thing or two...

We made our plans to start hiking by 6:30 and said our good nights. 
 Morning came and we were on the trail by 6:30 as planned. We hiked about 5 miles and came to another crossroad that had a deli just three tenths of a mile away... time to take a detour. After a breakfast sandwich, coffee and some ice cream, we got back to the trail. We are going to miss the accessibility of great food so close to the trail. In the meantime, we are taking full advantage. 
 We met a member of the class of 2013 AT alumni, trail name ""Story Time"", today. He was out on a day hike and stopped to talk with us about our hike. He was quick to open his pack and share the contents... trail magic!!!  A bit later we had arrived at the Dover Oak. This beautiful tree is estimated to be over three hundred years old. While there, ""Story Time"" showed up to get his car. He came towards us with yet more trail magic. Thank you ""Story Time""... we know you understand how much trail magic means to a thru-hiker.

I knew it was going to be another glorious day when the sun lit up my tent with an early morning glow.  In addition to this, dew levels were down and I got to pack a dry tent... less weight to boot. 
 We left Wiley Shelter this morning at 7:00 (yep, we slept in an additional thirty minutes, yippie) and crossed the New York/Connecticut border 1.5 miles later. We have officially entered New England and put New York safely behind us. Honestly, New York was fantastic to hike through.  The people are wonderful and the food that was accessible to us was amazing. It's a funny thing about how the mountains where we have been hiking are so close to populated areas that you are almost always within earshot of a highway and close to convenience stores, delis and of course New York style pizza.  You really can't help but take advantage of these opportunities because they tend to be rare occurrences, but mean so much to a thru-hiker. 
 One of the local sites we all agreed was a must see was Bulls Bridge. This covered bridge dates back to the eighteen hundreds and has been lovingly maintained. It was well worth the six tenths of a mile off trail to see. The added bonus was the Bull Bridge convenience store where we had our second breakfast, coffee, ice cream and packed our sandwiches for lunch. Like I said, you just can't pass up those opportunities. 
Once we continued on, we hiked along the beautiful Housatonic River for well over a mile.
 We did have a number of big climbs today as well. I think they were exceedingly difficult because of how tired we all are. We keep getting up early and hiking late. Most days have been eleven to twelve hours of hiking anywhere from 22 to 28 miles.  By the end of the day we are dragging ourselves to our planned stopping point. We are making the best of this journey, but I think we are also ready to finish it up.  
 One descent in particular called St. Johns Ledges was exceedingly difficult on its own, but add to this how tired we were and it ends up taking twice as long as it should. ""Scooby"" is getting shin splints, my knees and shins hurt, and ""Train Wreck"" has sore feet (actually we all do). 
 It's time to take a Nero... We'll pull into Salisbury tomorrow where ""Scooby"" and I have a resupply and I also have new shoes waiting on me. We'll check into a hostel, do laundry, take much needed showers, eat some (and eat some more again). The plan is to get a big breakfast on Sunday and put a shorter day, mile wise in.

When I got back to the trail I had hiked a few miles when I came to a forestry road that crossed the AT.  I spotted this guy sitting on a stone wall eating a bag of chocolate donuts when I waved politely and asked if he was okay. I started to hike on when I thought that I should turn back around and introduce myself. This guy's name was ""Scooby"".  If you've read previous postings you would know that my new friend and I have hiked about 650 miles since that chance meeting. Let me stress that it is extremely difficult to find someone you can hike with. Different personalities, hiking speeds and just different thoughts on how to achieve what our common goals are makes for a cautious approach when committing to hiking together. Well, my friend and hiking partner has been fighting serious shin splints for over a week now and has wisely decided to take a zero today (possibly more) and then reducing his daily miles. I told him that I'd take some time off with him, but he selflessly insisted I continue.  ""Scooby"" is going to finish his hike, but unfortunately it appears we won't Summit Mount Katahdin together.  I spoke with him this evening once ""Train Wreck' and I arrived at our planned camp. He is in good spirits... that's just like him, it's who he is. 
 ""Train Wreck"" and I had a big breakfast with ""Scooby"" this morning and I said my goodbyes... it was difficult.  It was like saying goodbye to a brother. So, on the trail by 10:00 which is late for us, we agreed on a short day of thirteen plus miles. A couple of the climbs were really tough. Bear Mountain for one, but Mt. Everett really kicked our butts.  Our plan for tomorrow is to start hiking by 6:00 AM to take advantage of the early light and cooler temperatures.  
Today we exited Connecticut and entered Massachusetts. That's ten states down and four to go. 
We also passed the 1,500 mile mark as well.

 As planned, ""Train Wreck"" and I were hiking at 6:00 AM. We met at the picnic table for coffee, conversation with a couple of other flip-flop thru-hikers and made our way up the trail. The trail ran its way through a beautiful conifer forest a good part of the day. The trail was soft underfoot for all the pine needles. Unfortunately though, the trail conditions were poor at best. Heavy growth hanging over the trail made passage difficult at times.  A lot of washouts tell a story of neglect as well. I know all us thru-hikers appreciate the hard work that trail maintainers do on the trail and we always thank any we meet on the trail. My criticism is simply an observation and a fair comparison to the trails in those states already hiked. We can only assume that the trail club responsible is have some trouble with getting volunteers. 
 I know I've mentioned my personal cravings while hiking in past postings, but lately I simply can't get enough cold Coke cola. We crossed US 7 today and walked to an antique store that had cold sodas today. I sucked down two cokes in about three minutes. The oppressive heat we had today made it impossible to get enough fluids.  It looks like we are forecast to have some cooler temperatures in a of couple days...please...
 We also found ourselves hiking through a swampy forest today that had the mosquitoes and black flies in waiting for our arrival. Our only defense was to attempt to out run them. The problem is that they have wings. It was a losing battle.  Score one for the mosquito/black fly team. 
 
 ""Scooby"" update...
I spoke with ""Scooby"" this afternoon and he is planning on a short hike of thirteen miles tomorrow.  He took a zero yesterday and today to allow his shin splints the opportunity to heal.

 It was another early start this morning with big plans for the day. We obviously plan our day around where we want to end up, but it's what you can do between point ""A"" and point ""Z"" that makes for a memorable hike. I really wanted to get to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin this afternoon for a swim. The cabin is a one hundred year old cabin that is run by the Appalachian Mountain Club or AMC. The hot weather made for ideal swimming conditions that I was not going to miss. ""Train Wreck"" had indicated that he was not interested, so I was going to go and meet up with him later. Well, once we arrived to the side trail to the cabin he quickly changed his mind. The caretaker, Nancy, couldn't have been more welcoming. We went for a swim and ate our lunch there before moving on to our final destination. Earlier in the day we did come across a little stand with soda and snacks for sale. This is exactly what I had been talking about and suggesting while on my hike.  This person has the entrepreneurial spirit that I've been looking for. Soda for one dollar, chips and cookies too. All on the honor system. It was really well done and so welcome after hiking in the heat today. NOBO hikers, turn left on Jerusalem Road mile marker 1540.1, about 150 feet on your right. 
 We hike through the town of Dalton tomorrow where there will likely be mass quantities of food consumed.  We also hope to meet the Cookie Lady tomorrow as well.

Lately, I've been setting my tent up minus the rain fly. We've had warmer evenings and no rain so I've been taking advantage of this opportunity. Another plus is the open views to the night sky, stars and full moon. It's almost like cowboy camping, but you are fully enclosed in a screened tent... no bugs. 
 I didn't start my hiking until about 6:30 this morning (I was moving a bit slow). My first stop was just 4 miles away at the Cookie Lady's house. I knew it would be too early to expect cookies from this woman who is a legend of the trail, but I stopped by just the same.  ""Lucky"", ""2.0"" and ""Lioness"" were tenting on her property so I chatted with them for a bit and filled up on water from the hose bib. No cookies for Whistler, so I was back on the trail and heading to the quaint little town of Dalton, MA. When I arrived I bumped into ""Jukebox"" and we decided to grab lunch at Angelina's sub shop which has been in business since 1958. The subs were fantastic. ""Jukebox"" and I got on a conversation about how close to the end of our hike we were. We discussed that anyone still hiking was 'in for the long haul'.  In other words, no one that has come this far was quitting. Unfortunately, we've seen hikers forced to come off the trail due to an injury. This being a reminder that we are all just one step from being forced off... quite humbling. ""Jukebox"" told me how his dad gave him two letters when he first started on March 13th. The first was to be opened at Springer Mountain (I didn't ask the content of the letter). The second letter was to be opened if he ever thought about quitting.  ""Jukebox"" is looking forward to handing that letter back to his father. 
 My next stop was the town of Cheshire, MA for dinner. I know, crazy right?  The trail actually ran right through these towns... awesome!  Two subs, sodas and ice cream makes for a happy hiker. Oh, and the temperatures were in the low 70's. To top all this off I saw my second bear today. This one was huge. No pictures or claw marks for proof. I heard a huge sound and saw him running away from me, not very graceful at all either. I can only guess that my hiker body odor had him running for cover. 
 So I had a friend ask what a hiker does if he finds he is hiking with someone who is not compatible with him/her? As I have posted before, it's difficult to find the perfect hiking companion. One may be faster/slower, impatient or simply have an over bearing personality or maybe just not a very nice person.  This happens in the world of long distance hiking. One way to separate is to run a bit slow in the morning and to suggest they go on and that you'll catch up; an effective approach that gives both parties a way out. Try this yourself if you are in such a situation, you'll be glad you did and will definitely enjoy your own hike more.

What an incredible day for hiking the AT today. I had stealth camped at the base of Mt. Greylock last night and was ready to take it on after my ""first"" breakfast of oatmeal and coffee. I stopped in at the Mark Noepel Shelter half way up for a quick break and my ""second"" breakfast of Pop Tarts. Continuing on, Mt. Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts (just under 3,500 feet). I'm not sure what got into me, but I found myself practically running up that mountain. My food bag being almost empty certainly helped. When I arrived at the summit I had my ""third"" breakfast at the summit lodge of eggs, hash browns , toast and coffee. Now I was ready for the big descent. I needed to resupply, so I made my way to the Stop and Shop in Willamstown, MA. It was just one half mile off trail, but for some reason miles always seem longer off the trail. When I arrived at the shopping plaza I ran into ""2.0"" and ""Laser Snake"" at the Pappa John's Pizza restaurant. They were running a half price hiker special... well OK then. I never imagined seeing myself sitting down to eat an entire meat lovers pizza before.  Hiker hunger is crazy. 
 I had my resupply shopping completed and was back on the trail by 3:00. I'm tenting at Seth Warner Shelter which is 3 miles inside the Vermont border. That's eleven states down and three to go...

It rained like crazy last night and I was starting to wonder how I'd ever get on the trail. Luck would be with me as there was a break and I was hiking by 6:15. The trail conditions started off pretty good, but then the rain started again. This time there was no stopping. I was soaked to the bone. At first I tried hopping and jumping stone to stone in an attempt to keep my feet somewhat dry. I finally gave up and went stomping through them like my grandson would. He would have loved it... me, not so much. 
 This section of the trail in Vermont is actually part of the Long Trail. The AT follows/shares the Long Trail for 105 of the 273 miles. The Long Trail actually runs all the way to Canada.  
 I finally gave up and pitched my tent at 4:30, crawled in, stripped off my wet clothes and put on some warm dry clothes. Dinner fixed, swallowed down and then it was time for very early bed.  I can hardly wait to put those wet clothes on in the morning.

I slept like the dead last night.  After crawling into my tent I ate two dinners. I just can't get enough food in me.  I'm in a constant state of hunger. I was so tired afterwards that I cleaned myself up (as best as possible) and crawled under my quilt. Ten hours later, it was time to hike again. I can't remember the last time I ever slept ten hours. 
 I've seen bears, lots of dear, turkey, snakes and now I've seen evidence of moose. The ""evidence"" tells me that it was a very large moose.  They have the entire mountain range, but they have to use the trail to do their business. 
 By now those that follow my journal know that I post every day, every day that I have data service that is. Verizon has been fantastic for my entire journey, but it's looking like service may diminish a bit. I'll continue to write my journal and will upload when service is available. 
 The green mountain range is lush and yep green. If the rain thus far is any indication of normal rain fall, I understand why they call them the Green Mountains. The mud covered pretty much of the trail today.  I slipped and fell three times so you can imagine how filthy I was.  It's been over a week since I've done laundry so I'm going to have to get to a town.  A town with a couple restaurants would be good...
 While finishing up my first lunch today I met ""Kazoo"" and ""Milly"". These very young 18 year old twins had recently graduated high school and decided they would hike the long trail. This is their last thing they will do together before heading off to separate universities in the fall. 
 I had the pleasure of meeting Hugh and Jean Joudey today as well. This couple have been the caretakers of Stratton Mountain Lookout Tower for many years (since 1947). It turns out that Hugh has his roots in Nova Scotia so they invited me to sit in their cabin to chat.  That was fine by me as they are a lovely couple and I got to get away from the black flies too...
""Scooby"" update:
I spoke with ""Scooby"" this evening and he is doing great. He took the day off in Dalton to make himself take it easy (actually went to see Wonder Woman).  He will hike again tomorrow, but is trying to keep his miles down.

 As those that have been following me on my journal know, ""Scooby"" had to take some time to allow his shin splints to heal. I attempted to hang with him through that process, but he wouldn't allow it. His concern was that it could take a long time or possibly they might not heal at all. I reluctantly moved on, but stayed in contact. Last night we talked and it looks like ""Scooby"" is on the mend. I've decided to slow down my northerly migration to allow ""Scooby"" to catch up. I pulled a Nero today and will Zero tomorrow. I'll hike out on Tuesday, but will keep my miles down. If all goes well we will meet up in less than a week. 
 Today was a simple 5.3 mile hike to VT 11/30 where I was able to hitch a ride into Manchester. Thank you trail angel Nicki who saw me while heading in the opposite direction, turned around, picked me up and drove ten miles out of her way to deliver me to McDonald's. While there, ""Crispy"" came in and chatted for a bit while we both did some homework. 
 While eating my Egg McMuffins I was working the phone to find a place for the evening. And then I found Terry... Terry picked me up and took me to her home.  I was able to shower and do laundry. When all cleaned up I tried to help out by painting a table for her. We finished up a respectable days work, got cleaned up and went out for dinner. 
 Hiker advice... stop in Manchester... loads of dining and resupply options. It's a very hiker friendly community.

I spent the night in a real house and slept in a real bed last night and will again tonight. Terry had most recently placed her name on a list as a Trail Angel willing to take in thru-hikers. I was her first thru-hiker... I mentioned that I painted a table for her yesterday and this morning I painted her recently renovated bathroom. This was after she prepared a terrific breakfast for me.  She also prepared dinner as thanks for the work I was able to do while here. I guess this falls into the category of ""work for stay"". After I finished painting, I asked Terry for a ride into town where I got lunch (McDonalds never tasted so good), coffee at Starbucks (welcome to civilization Whistler) and to catch a movie. I saw The Mummy with Tom Cruise (don't waste your time or money). I was going to hike out after breakfast, but it's calling for heavy rain and area flooding of streams and creeks. I'm staying with another Trail Angel tomorrow as Terry's place is not available. I hope ""Scooby"" is better off where he is, but I doubt it.  The weather system I'm looking at is covering most of the Eastern Seaboard.

 I wanted to mention one of my favorite daily stops while here in Manchester.  Mrs. Murphy's Donuts has been my favorite place for afternoon coffee and donuts these past three days. It's an old time shop that has been recognized as Vermont's best donut shop. Having opened in 1977, they are celebrating their fortieth anniversary this year.  It was fun seeing all the old timers sitting around drinking coffee and eating donuts while they solved all the worlds problems. 
 Tonight I am staying at Jennifer's home with a young couple from Montreal. Gabriel and Camille are hiking southbound on the Long Trail which was helpful for this Northbound hiker. I was able to glean a bit of information regarding what's coming up.

I was up and about way too early this morning, but I just couldn't sleep anymore. Jen had set the coffee pot up the night before and baked a blueberry walnut coffee cake.  I flipped the switch on the Mr. Coffee and cut a slab of coffee cake off that was about as big as the plate I put it on. A couple of hikers came in late last night and joined me a bit later (I was having seconds). ""Goddess"" and ""Boss"" are mother and daughter and started their hike where they left off last year at Port Clinton.  Jen was up a bit later and was ready to drop us off at the trail head.  But, first we had to make a quick stop at McDonald's for a couple of Egg McMuffins to go... at my request. The weather could not have been better. It never got out of the sixties, no rain, part sun and a nice stiff breeze that kept most bugs at bay. The trail was actually in really good shape today as well, some mud, but not too bad at all.  Some of you out there may not know what today is.  Yes, it's the Summer Solstice, but it's also ""National Hike Naked Day"".  I would have, but I didn't remember until I was in my tent for the evening.  Apparently, no one else remembered either (at least none of those hikers I had seen today). There were several really beautiful views today as well (no nudes, just beautiful mountain views). I was really able to take my time today in order to enjoy them. I actually took my pack off and sat down to admire the views a couple of times as well.  I was done with my miles by 4:00 and had my tent pitched by 4:10.  Remember, I'm trying to do low miles so ""Scooby"" can catch up.  I was bored beyond comprehension.  That only leaves one thing to do...eat.  Okay, dinner prepared and consumed by 6:00.  Now what?  Nothing left to do but hang my food bag and go to bed.

I didn't intend to hike 18.6 miles, it just seemed to happen. I got a good late start this morning knowing that I had an easy day. I finally started at 7:00 and really took my time. Elevations and terrain were favorable too. One of the more interesting sites along the trail today was the ""Rock Gardens of White Cliffs"". These stacked stone cairns are said to have been placed there by gnomes. The picture shown here does little justice as there are hundreds of these stacked cairns, too many to count and too difficult to clearly show in a photo. When 3:00 came around I decided to continue to Rt. 103 where my guide describes Que's Whistle Stop restaurant. Now, in all fairness, Guthook's Guide (AT hiker app) does say that it might be closed. I was willing to take a chance. I hiked the half mile along the 103 and found that it was indeed closed and for sale. I was about to do an about face and hike the half mile back when a car pulled up. I asked if there might be another restaurant close by. ""Why sure there is"". Loretta's is ""just a half mile further up the 103"". Well, as my wife always says, "" In for a penny, in for an pound"". Onward I marched...  when I arrived I ordered an Italian ""grinder"", that's what they call a sub sandwich in this part of the country.  It was really a great sandwich no matter what you want to call it.  I followed that up with a Coke, Gatorade and a pint of ice cream. While I was eating a gentleman named Uwe sat and chatted with me and offered to take me the mile back to the trail head.  This was definitely a worthwhile trip.

I wouldn't have gotten up so early except for feeling rain in the air. It was to have rained last night, but that rain skirted around us.  At around 5:30 I just felt like I needed to get moving. My tent was dry and I didn't want to push my luck.  I was hiking by 6:15 and was in no rush to be anywhere in particular. The rain did find me and did its job well.  I was soaked to the bone in no time flat.  I didn't even bother to put on my rain jacket as it was way to hot for that.   I just took my lumps and hiked on. I did have my sights set on the lodge on top of Mt. Killington. Mt. Killington is the second highest peak in Vermont and home to an exclusive ski resort.  The 2,000 feet climb to the 4,000 plus feet peak was not a very difficult one, but the chair lift is a lot easier I'm sure. Anyway, as I had said earlier, I knew I was hiking a short day because ""Scooby"" and I had made our plans to meet on Saturday. So I spent three hours at this lodge where I had an incredible meal.  I also sat at the bar and enjoyed a local beer while I took in the incredible views. The staff at this very high end establishment were running around setting up for a big wedding that evening.  I had to laugh to myself with the thought that the mother of the bride might have been there and her looking at me wondering when I would be leaving, or possibly wondering if I was one of the groom's guests.  The thought of crashing the wedding did actually occur to me.  Although, I might have stood out...especially when I asked the bride for a dance. 
 When I arrived at Churchill Scott Shelter this evening I ran into ""LILO"" and ""Stitch"". They are a wonderful couple that I've leapfrogged numerous times.  Anyway, they snapped a tent pole while setting up and were really upset and concerned.  Not to worry, ""Whistler"" to the rescue.  I had a piece of tubing for tent pole repairs that I've carried 1,700 miles.  It finally came in handy. 
 ""Scooby"" is just five miles behind me and will meet me where I'm camped tonight first thing in the morning.  We will hike five miles to Mountain Meadows Lodge, grab a bite and make our plans.

Yep, I know, a whole 5.9 miles hiked today.  I can explain the reason for this seemingly pathetic day.  ""Scooby"" met me at the Churchill Scott Shelter at 8:30 this morning as planned and we hiked the couple of miles to the Inn at the Long Trail as planned.  We did laundry and waited for the pub to open at 11:30... as planned. From there we started to make our way to the Mountain Meadows Lodge.  We took a slight detour though.  While on the trail we met ""The Bear"" who was posting a sign for trail magic.  ""The Bear"" had to come off the trail for a blown knee and decided he would offer an act of kindness. Hot dogs and pop makes for happy hikers.  We spent about an hour there and enjoyed hearing his stories as well. 
 After our hot dog snack, we made our way to Mountain Meadows Lodge, checked in, showered and obviously made our plans for the next feeding. With pizza on the way we finalized our plans for the next few days. It's hard to believe that we will be entering New Hampshire this week (state number thirteen) and the much anticipated White Mountains.  From my perspective, I'm really pleased that my hiking buddy is back.

With breakfast included in our room rate, a late departure was predictable. Cereal, orange juice, coffee, fruit salad, yogurt and quiche  demanded our time and attention. Once our breakfast obligations were met we were on the trail by 7:45. 
""Vermud"" was actually kind to us today.  With the most beautiful clear skies, the mud was not bad at all, especially when you consider all the rain we have had recently. There were a couple of big climbs, but I looked at them as training for what's soon to come in the ""Whites"". Actually the entire previous 1,700 miles has been our ""training"" for the ""Whites"".  A couple notable sites today included Thundering Falls and The Lookout. Thundering Falls is the largest waterfall in Vermont that is on the AT. The Lookout is privately owned which hikers are allowed to use. There is a stair type ladder that leads to a railed platform on the roof. The views from this platform are priceless.  I could have sat up there all day. 
 The incentive to move on from The Lookout was ice cream at the On The Edge Farm on Vermont route 12. ""Scooby"" and I polished off a pint each and washed it down with a cold pop.  That was just what the Dr. ordered for our last 2.5 miles of the day.  Tomorrow will take us to the town of Norwich where there are a couple of mail drop boxes waiting me.  More on that tomorrow...

The weather last night was spectacular with clear skies and a refreshing mountain air chill. Stars lit up the sky which called for a no rain fly night for my tent. I laid in my tent staring at the sky above me and realized that the end of my journey is so very close. While hiking you have that time to reflect on what's happened, what's happening and what's going to happen.  I thought back to when I started this dream. I remember counting the miles hiked each day and adding them to the total. Those were the miles that brought me closer to achieving this monumental task. Today I find that I'm subtracting and counting down how many miles are left before Katahdin. Those are the same miles left before I can go home. Home is where Annie is... I've not seen her since March 5th, that first day at Springer when we said our goodbyes. Sure, this all sounds so sentimental, but isn't that all part of the journey?  Here I am typing this journal entry on a smartphone keyboard with one hand and wiping tears with the other. Yep, it's all part of the journey... life's journey. 
 About today's hike... I woke up, started packing up and pulled our food bags out of the tree we hung them on the night before.  As is the routine, I deliver ""Scooby's"" bag to his tent. It's one of those expectations that he always appreciates. He says it's like magic... he wakes up and his food bag is there waiting on him. 
 We hiked for forty five minutes when we came to a creek crossing with a cooler on the other side. Trail magic?   Only one way to find out.  I crossed first while hanging on to the cable strung across to aid with the rapid force of the raised creek.  Yes!!! Soda as trail magic is always welcomed, even at 7:00 AM in the morning.  That sugar rush was truly appreciated with the climb we were getting ready to face as well. The hiking today was really kind to us again.  It was a beautiful walk through conifer forest, deep piled pine needles and limited ""Vermud"" aka Vermont mud. 
 Our destination was the town of Norwich. As I mentioned yesterday, a couple of packages await me. My sister and my son, daughter-in-law and my granddaughters sent Birthday greetings to the hotel where we were booked. 
 My son Richard, his wife Lauren and my precious granddaughters sent me a small backpack size bottle of Irish whiskey that I will enjoy on my actual birthday (June 30th).  The girls also made homemade birthday cards for Grand Pop Whistler.
 A bit more about my sisters method of delivering her gift/ box to me... Susan is an avid baker when she isn't playing doctor. Her flour brand of choice is King Arthur. This storied company has been producing flour since 1790 and is highly regarded in the world of baking. Oh, this company also happens to be headquartered in Norwich.  Anyway, Susan has developed a relationship with Laurie, a customer service representative.  Susan shipped my box filled with hiker goodies to Laurie and Laurie and twelve of her friends delivered it to the Norwich Inn. We gathered in the hotel's pub, ate, drank and of course sang happy birthday to Whistler.  An incredible evening and one which will not soon be forgotten.  
FYI, the Norwich Inn is a beautiful property and one that I would highly recommend. 
 Tomorrow is another big day as we say farewell to Vermont and greet the great state of New Hampshire.

We were up and ready to roll early this morning. We had made our plans last night which included breakfast in Hanover this morning. Crossing the Connecticut river had us leaving Vermont and entering New Hampshire in our first thirty minutes of hiking this morning.  Once in Hanover we were kindly directed by a passerby to Lou's restaurant.  Lou's must have a history that I'm unaware of, but the free doughnut for hikers as a starter to my breakfast certainly got my full attention. I ordered the Red Flannel Hash which is corned beef hash with two poached eggs, potatoes and toast.  It was a perfect start to a perfect start.  A problem did rear its ugly head when I discovered one of my trekking poles was missing its tip.  This required some ""working the smartphone"". I had my REI order done while enjoying my last cup of coffee. Unfortunately, I really needed the new poles ASAP and had to order them via  overnight delivery. A hefty mailing fee made the purchase a painful one, but they will be waiting for me to pick them up tomorrow... they better be.  ""Scooby"" and I hit the trail a bit late because of my trekking pole mishap while knowing that we had to hike twenty five miles.  New Hampshire was proud to give us a small taste of things to come with a few big climbs too. A threat of late afternoon storms just missed us.  We could feel the air changing, see the dark clouds roll in and could hear the thunder. The radar on my phone showed the storm band splitting and going around us... how lucky. Our luck ran out though. Later in the day we still had another hour of hiking to get to our planned camp when another storm brewed.  We were going as quickly as our tired bodies could go, but not fast enough. The skies opened up with high winds, rain and hail just as we reached the top of Smarts Mountain; now that really smarted. We were soaked in no time and freezing cold. All I could do is put my rain jacket on and wait it out (kind of like closing the barn door after the horses got out). When it finally quit I found a small patch of flat ground between two tents already pitched. Seriously, I pitched my tent within inches of these other tents. It's all I could do as the space was so limited.  I crawled in, dried off and put on dry clothes.  I wish they were warm clothes, but those get picked up tomorrow. Susan mailed  them to the Hostel we will be staying at tomorrow. Here I am in my tent, shivering with my winter gear twenty miles further north... misjudged that one by one day... oops!

Ann Marie here, a.k.a., ""the one waiting"".  Bill asked that if there are days without a journal entry from him, that I let you know I have heard from him (via cell phone yesterday morning) and he and ""Scooby"" were enjoying hiking in New Hampshire, especially the weather (so far).  I believe they are staying in a hostel tonight so all of you will be able to 'catch up' with him tonight or tomorrow morning.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for all of the support given Bill by so many of you along his journey; signing his journal guest book, sending him emails and texts, the mailing of drop boxes filled with delicious foods, the many, many ""Trail Angel"" moments, the Sunday updates given by our dear neighbour Sarah in church each week, the list just goes on and on.

I posted my journal for yesterday, but what nobody knows is that I wrote it at 1:30 in the morning. After getting caught in that rain, sleet and hail, I was so wet and cold that all I wanted was to get warm and go to sleep. I eventually woke up and wrote and posted my journal and then went back to sleep. Fast forward to 5:00 AM when I rolled over and went back to sleep. Fast forward to 6:00 AM when I woke up again and realized that I had to get up. It had to be forty degrees if not colder.  ""Scooby"" and I agreed on a 7:00 AM departure so I really needed to get moving.  Oatmeal was cooked and eaten and coffee was being enjoyed while I packed up. We started down Smarts Mountain and ran into ""Acorn"" whom I had not seen for weeks. I was in the lead when I came to a boggy spot on the trail. I stepped on what I thought was a secured bog board, but was actually a floating log.  I ended up in the bog up to my thighs. Yep, it wasn't pretty.  I was covered in mud and I ended up with a two inch gash on one leg. 
I got as clean as I could and hiked on to the next creek where I was able to clean and dress my wound properly.  
 A bit later we had another good climb up Mt Cube. At just 2,900 feet, the views were almost 360 degrees. This was just a tease for what we will start seeing in the coming days while hiking the White Mountains. We met ""Huff and Puff"" while at the summit. When we got around to sharing trail names he recognized me and then ""Scooby"" by association because he follows me on Trail Journals. 
 About five miles later we met Carl the Omelette guy.  Carl is set up directly on the trail with a huge canopy tent and outdoor kitchen. This is his second year making omelettes for hikers. He provides trail magic all hiking season long... every day May through September. He'll make you an omelette or pancakes.  He has coffee, juice, muffins, cookies and bananas. The best part for me was when I walked up he recognized me from Trail Journals too. He was able to recite everything about my hike.  I thanked him for his generosity and for following me on my journey.  Tomorrow is when we actually enter the ""Whites"", specifically Mount Moosilauke which is almost a five thousand foot peak. More on how that goes tomorrow.

We had agreed to make today a short one for a couple of reasons. First, we knew Mt. Moosilauke was going to be a bit of a challenge. At just under 5,000 feet we wanted to get our ""feet"" wet and take our time. We also knew of the bad weather that was expected and planned accordingly. And finally, we really wanted to enjoy the summit as much as possible. The climb up was steep and rocky, but with no serious risks. The summit was absolutely breathtaking. At this elevation you are completely above the tree line with 360 degree views make for an all inspiring experience. From my perspective the reward far out weighs the effort of the climb. The first thing ""Scooby"" and I did as we approached the summit was to ""suit up"". Rain/wind jackets were needed to provide shielding from the intensively high winds and the rain that was just starting to come down. The winds would easily knock you over if you didn't brace yourself against it. The cold rain and wind helped guide our decision to start our long descent on what we knew was the steep side of this intimidating mountain. To top things off the rains intensified to the point that we needed to seek shelter. Fortunately, Beaver Brook Shelter was half way down so we made that our destination. As we arrived at the shelter it really started to pour. ""McFlurry"", ""Sequoia"", ""Laser Snake"", "" Grizzly"" and ""Lobo"" were already in there enjoying what we were seeking, the safety of shelter. Now out of the rain, I put on some warm clothes and made myself lunch. I checked the radar on my phone and it didn't look good. It was only 2:00 in the afternoon and it was looking like we were trapped. An hour later I saw a break coming on the radar and ""Scooby"" agreed that we should make a run for it.  My thoughts were that the rocks couldn't get any wetter. It was very slow going, but that's OK if we get there safely. As steep as it was on the south side coming up, it was twice as steep and difficult on the north side. We took our time and we're so lucky that the rain held off. 
We are stealth camping at Kinsman Notch where we pitched our tents, ate dinner, hung our food bags and crawled into our tents just as the rain started coming down hard again. We must be living right. Anyway, I'm in my tent, warm, safe and dry on the Appalachian Trail. It was a good day, a very good day.

The plan was to hike out at 6:00 but it rained all night and right into the morning. When 6:00 came around ""Scooby"" sent me a text that his vote was to wait until 7:00 to decide what to do. My text back was that I was in full support. I had no problem rolling over and going back to sleep. Things did start clearing up by 7:00 so we started packing up and hit the trail at 8:00. Fifteen minutes into our hike we crossed the Kinsman Notch parking lot when a car pulled up. A three time AT hiker  ""Left Field"" jumped out of his car and asked if we were thru-hikers. When we replied with an affirmative he pulled out a couple of cold beers for us. Sure, it was only 8:00 in the morning but beer provides lots of nutrients and is actually considered a breakfast beverage in some countries ( I don't know which countries but I heard this somewhere... I think). Anyway, it's my birthday today and I can do whatever I want. ""Left Field"" did offer us another but we passed because we did have mountains to conquer after all. We did accept the candy bars he offered. Candy bars are actually a breakfast food in some countries.  
 On to our hike... it was tough, real tough. The White Mountains are truly living up to their reputation. The boulder climbs are tough enough but throw in all the standing water, ankle high mud and raised creek levels that require cautious fording, your progress is slow... very slow. I had two slip and falls today with no physical harm but a lot of mud to clean up. The climbs require hand over hand at times and it really tests your physical and mental abilities. There were several times that if not for tree roots to grab onto I'm not sure how forward progress could be made. The low mileage day is evidence of this slow advance through the Whites. Our goal is to do our best and to stay healthy.  The big mile days are just going to have to wait for when conditions are right. We are camped at the Kinsman Pond Shelter tonight. This is a AMC run camp with a caretaker and a $10 fee required for tenting. This is the first year that the AMC is experimenting with giving hikers a fifty percent off card with their first stay at one of their club run sites. It is also good for discounts at their huts for snacks and drinks. It sounds like a good deal so we'll see how it works for us. Our plan for tomorrow if all works as planned is to hike five miles to Franconia Notch and either hitch a ride or call for a shuttle to Lincoln where we can resupply then get back to the trail to add on some more miles. Unfortunately, it looks like rain again tomorrow.

While researching and planning my thru-hike, I had set some personal goals and had hoped I might enjoy some of those fun and iconic memories that I had read so much about. One of those experiences was realized this morning. The Appalachian Mountain Club or AMC has full jurisdiction over the ""Huts"" and campsites. The ""Huts"" are elaborate structures with a full dining room, bathrooms and bunk rooms for paying guests. When I say paying I mean paying. The rate for a bunk is about $140.00 per night, per person. This could be costly for a thru-hiker so we tend to not stay at the ""Huts"".  But, they are very popular and with reservations required, they tend to fill up. Their are eight of these in the Whites and they can accommodate  anywhere from 40 and some up to 100 people. Your fee also includes breakfast and dinner. So, back to my goal. The ""Croo"" (sounds and means crew but spelled Croo) will allow thru-hikers to finish off the leftovers if you arrive after guests and ""Croo"" have eaten. ""Scooby"", ""Grizzly"", ""Lobo"" and yours truly did just that. We arrived at Lonesome Lake Hut at the perfect time. We had cold cinnamon raisin oatmeal, cold scrambled eggs, blueberry coffee cake and apple juice for breakfast.  The ""Croo"" couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming. Leftovers never tasted so good!!!  
 After breakfast, ""Scooby"" and I got back on the trail with a visit to the town of Lincoln for a food resupply on our agenda. We hiked to Franconia Notch, took a side trail .9 miles to the visitors center and looked for someone who would drive us the 3.5 miles to Lincoln. We were there for about 32 seconds when I asked a gentleman if he would take us to town. ""Why of course, hop in I'd be happy to"".  He got us to the Price Chopper grocery store, but first we wanted to get laundry done. The coin laundry was right next door. As soon as we walked in a man walks in after us and asks if we are thru-hikers. We tell him we are and he offers to take us back to the visitors center after we complete our business. We explained that we still have a couple of hours before we would be ready. No problem he says... trail angel ""Limping Eagle"" was awesome to wait and give us that lift. 
 Finally back on the trail with full stomachs, clean clothes and full food bags, we started up Mt. Lafayette. We were getting a late start so we set a reasonable goal of getting to Liberty Spring Campsite. This would be a good time to mention that this is a 2.9 mile very steep climb up Mt. Lafayette and that we were trying to beat an oncoming severe thunderstorm. We did our best, but we failed... All I can say is that setting up a tent in rain and high winds was never on my wishlist. 
Tomorrow?  We climb the rest of Mt. Lafayette which peaks at 5,260 feet. I'm hoping for a clear morning for some spectacular views.

The rain last night was of biblical proportions. I found that my tent is no longer waterproof evidenced by my having to mop up my tent floor all night. I still got plenty of sleep and ""Scooby"" and I were on the trail at 6:15 and ready to get some miles. Our last couple of days have been pretty unproductive for the rain storms and to be honest, the ""Whites"" are kicking our butts. I'd read how you can pretty much count on reduced miles while hiking through the White Mountains and I'm here to tell you that it's no lie. It's also a psychological brain drain to go from hiking twenty plus miles in a day to half that. You actually start to question if you are physically capable for what lies ahead. If I were hiking alone I'd seriously question myself, but the fact that my hiking partner is dealing with the same demons makes it easier to accept. We have discussed this at length and we agree that we are going to take it easy, try not to get hurt and take those miles as they come. 
 Our major climb today was to the summit of Mt. Lafayette. It was a tough climb and unfortunately for us no payoff in the way of a view.  The summit of 5,260 feet was in a fog this morning leaving nothing for us to see except the trail before us. That's OK though because the challenge of the climb is rewarding. It's tough, but it's supposed to be. You make that climb and hope for a view, but sometimes you just high five each other for your efforts and move on to the next mountain that's waiting for your arrival. 
 That next ""one"" was Mt. Garfield. At 4,500 feet, this mountain has a few tricks of its own. A tough climb with no switch backs which calls for a near vertical climb. The good news was that we received a 360 degree panoramic view above the tree line.
 Next on the hit parade was the South Twin Mountain. This mountain summits at 4,902 feet and too, was a near vertical climb that at times required hand over hand climbing. 
 A couple of highlights for the day included ""Scooby"" and I stopping in at the Galehead Hut for lunch. The AMC issued us both a camp card (we paid $10:00 for it) when we camped at one of their campsites. A benefit of the card is that you get a free bowl of soup and two baked goods which we redeemed today. The next very special highlight for me was that we arrived at Zealand Falls Hut at 7:30 to fill our water bottles before hiking on in hopes of finding a stealth site for our very tired bodies. When we walked in the ""Croo"" greeted us and asked if we wanted dinner. Well, of course we did.  The general ""rule"" is that one or two thru-hikers are able to do a work for stay at a hut. Doing a work for stay means you do some work around the Hut and in return you get leftovers and can sleep in the Hut.  This is one of those experiences I was hoping I could do for no other reason than to have the memory of the experience.  The ""Croo"" of Kate, Amber and Jubilee allowed us to eat first. Dinner was stuffed shells, corn and a big fat slice of chocolate cake. My job assignment was to clean the stove burners and drip trays. In the end, those hard miles we did today paid off...

The work for stay last night also allows for the hiker/worker to sleep on the dining room floor. A pretty good deal since your not having to pitch your tent or sleep in a shelter with a bunch of people snoring. All guests know and are reminded that lights out and quiet time is at 9:30. The fact that ""Scooby"" and I were laying on the floor on our mats and quilts didn't stop a group of four from using headlamps to continue their card game a couple of feet where we lay. When I accepted the fact that they had very little regard for anyone but themselves, I moved out to the covered porch. It was a beautiful night with a sky filled with stars and a bright moon. This was my first ""cowboy"" camping and it couldn't have been better. Thank you rude, obnoxious, card playing people for making me move outside.  It was awesome!!!
We were up early, packed and out of the Hut by 6:10 this morning. Our first eight miles were fast and easy...the rest of the day was a challenge. Mt. Webster was probably the most difficult climb on the entire trail thus far. We would get to a section where you would stand at the bottom, not be able to see to the top, and ask how in the world are you supposed to climb it. The answer is slowly and one step at a time. It was a put your trekking poles away and start a hand over hand climb; challenging, slow, but fun and rewarding.  This was also the first time we had site of Mt. Washington with its summit hidden well above the clouds. Mt. Jackson (another 4K climb) was just as challenging and with equally beautiful views. We achieved what we set out to do today and are camping at Nauman Campsite  which sets us up for an early approach to Mt. Washington. Mt. Washington is a 6,288 summit and the granddaddy of the ""Whites"".  More on that adventure tomorrow. In the meantime, I wanted to journal a bit on the spectacular views I've seen while on this adventure. It's difficult to begin to describe in words what I have seen from some of the highest peaks along the Appalachian Trail. It's equally as difficult to get an accurate and true perspective from photos I've taken as they simply serve as nothing more than an injustice to their enormity and awe inspiring beauty. Some days I hike for hours, get to the summit and see nothing more than my feet on the trail and fog. Other times I'll hike mile upon mile, hour after hour, and summit and all I can say, all I can come up with is Wow!  What else can you say?  The photos are great, but the burning impressions on my brain will always be their and I'll never forget them. And, every time I think of them I'll simply say to myself... Wow!!!

Could there be a better way to spend the Forth of July than with the father of our country?  Well that's what ""Scooby"" and I did, well sort of. I was up at 4:15 this morning with a plan to enjoy my coffee that I'd missed out on the morning before. I had a tough day yesterday with a few stumbles, rolled ankles and slip and falls that I finally attributed to my lack of coffee. I was also hungry all day yesterday and committed to myself that I wasn't going to let that happen again. Two cups of java, one pack of Poptarts and two tortillas filled with pre-cooked bacon and mustard is how I started the day. We left the Nauman Campsite  right at 6:00 and hiked the 6.2 miles to the summit of Mt. Washington. The high winds did their very best to knock us over and every measured step we took was placed with full caution  for fear of getting blown off our feet. In the end it was a far easier ascent than we were lead to believe it was going to be so we took our time at the summit to take it all in. It was 28 degrees with the wind chill factor with sustained winds at 35 miles per hour and gusts over 50 miles per hour. Our winter gear came in handy as we were layered up as if it were the middle of winter. In other words, it was a very calm day on Mt. Washington. Unfortunately, it was also very foggy and clouds drifted in just to make sure we wouldn't happen to get a view. Disappointed?  You could say I was some, but I still enjoyed the climb and made the best of it. 
 We hiked on after we grabbed lunch at the summit snack bar and made our way to the Madison Spring Hut six miles away for a snack before taking on Mt. Madison. Mt. Madison was an entirely different kettle of fish.  At 5,357 feet, this mountain is almost completely above tree line and is a monster to both climb and descend. When we finally made it off Madison we made a mad dash (as best we could with our exhausted bodies) to Osgood tent site. We arrived at 8:30, tired and hungry. Tents pitched, water fetched and hunger satisfied, we crawled (literally) into our tents. It's now 10:30 and all I can say is Happy Forth of July and good night...

When we had arrived at Osgood Tent site last night we discovered a very poor looking location, but it was very late and there were no real options. New Hampshire has very strict rules regarding where you can camp with heavy fines applied if the rules are broken. The Campsite is very small with limited tent spaces that are actually on raised platforms. My only choice was to set up on an already occupied platform that had room for my tent. Well the folks were already in their tent (8:30 at night) and not real happy with me. I tried my best to be a quiet as possible, but I still interrupted them. It happens... not much can be done. This morning I was able to greet them at 4:30 when they got up for their early start... it happens... not much can be done. 
 Since I was up, I fixed myself an early cup of coffee and my first breakfast. ""Scooby"" and I hit the trail at 6:30 with plans to hike the five miles to Pinkman Notch Visitors Center for our second breakfast. As we were hiking we came across several SOBO hikers (South bound hikers) and stopped a few minutes to chat. You see, they started southbound the first week of June in Maine and are just now passing us as we head north. They have information we ""need"" regarding what's ahead for us and we have information that they ""need"". So, we swapped info... We arrived at the Visitors Information Center three minutes after 9:00. It turns out that they stop serving breakfast at 9:00. NO EXCEPTIONS!!!  Even though they had piles of food that they were pulling out of the service case. To top it off lunch, doesn't start until 9:30. No problem for us really as we had chores to attend to while we waited. When they re-opened, we ordered our sandwiches from a great guy and pointed to all the breakfast items on the table behind him and joked how we could have helped him with the leftovers. Don't you know that he did just that. Our plates were piled up. Sometimes just one person can make all the difference in a person's day. 
 Our hike out of Pinkham started with a slow creeping climb up Wildcat mountain which was appropriately named. With several peaks all above 4,000 this mountain was a ""Wildcat"". We decided we needed a break and made our way to the last ""Hut"" of the eight in the AMC's inventory of huts for a snack and break at Carter Notch Hut which was just a short distance more for two crazy tired hikers. Along the way we met a trail volunteer/trail angel by the trail name ""Camo"".  This enthusiastic fella was hiking the trail hanging his new handmade way finding signs when he stopped to talk to us. He pulled out some trail magic (Snickers candy bars) and was so positive, so friendly and so kind at a time ""Scooby"" and I truly needed it. Here we were feeling exhausted and tired but with still so far to go and along comes ""Camo"". His positive attitude gave us that hidden energy ( the Snickers bars helped too...) we needed to finish out our day. Sometimes just one person can make all the difference in a persons day. 
 We arrived at Imp Campsite at exactly 8:00 which made for another very long day. We stopped by to check in with the caretaker and met ""Manny"" who was so kind and welcoming. We felt like we were part of her family. We paid for our sites and walked away and I thought to myself that ""sometimes just one person can make all the difference in a persons day""... I had three of them.

It's kind of funny how fast you can move/hike when you know there's real food and a real bed waiting at the other end. We only had the 8.1 miles to the White Mountains Hostel  and we did them in under four hours. It sure helped knowing that there were no four, five or six thousand foot mountains in the way.  While making our way along this easy portion of the trail we were reminded just how close to the finish we are. Someone had taken sticks and arranged them in the shape of the number 300 ""Scooby"" said that a SOBO must have arranged them to show they had successfully hiked three hundred miles. That's when it hit us...it could have been a NOBO that arranged them to show how many miles were left before Katahdin. 
 Speaking of SOBO's, we are seeing more of them every day. Most of the ones we spoke with started the first week of June making this week their first month anniversary. Lord, please don't let it take me another month to reach Katahdin. ""Scooby"" and I have an arbitrary date of July 23rd, but so much depends on the trail and especially the weather. 
 About the White Mountains Hostel... hikers, you want to stay here. When you first arrive you are required to change into loaner clothes in the dressing room in the garage. From there you are taken to the shower for a great hot shower. While you are doing this your clothes (all your dirty laundry is being washed. There is a freezer of ice cream, soda machine, hiker refrigerator, all you can eat homemade waffles in the morning and the house is spotless. Shuttles are provided for resupply and/or restaurants. It is right off the trail head, .2 miles and highly recommended. 
 Once ""Scooby"" and I arrived and showered, we ordered pizza and cheese bread to share. So since I've arrived at the Hostel I've eaten half of a large pizza, a half order of cheese bread, a pint of ice cream, a Coke, two Powerades,  a whole rotisserie chicken, a bag of corn chips, three beers, a box of ten chocolate Twinkies, four Ding Dongs, a box of Good & Plenty and a cup of coffee.  All this in less than a ten hour period... hiker hunger is a crazy thing.

I got a great night's sleep last night and woke up at my usual time. I made myself go back to sleep as 5:00 AM doesn't work well when you are at a hostel.  When 6:30 came around I could smell the coffee and the all you can eat Snow waffles freshly out of the waffle iron. Four, four is all I could eat... they were huge, crisp and really good, but I could only eat four. We were packed and ready to hit the trail at 8:30... yep a late start for us. So, something I didn't mention yet is that I believe that I broke my little toe. I was walking through the kitchen in my hostel  issued flip flops when I ran my right foot into a brick fireplace hearth. I wanted to scream out, but I managed to just limp away. A couple of hours later my small toe was puffed up and had turned black. The only thing I could do was tape it to his buddy next door, take ibuprofen and Tylenol and hike on. This made for some tough and slow hiking for me today. That was one reason why we decided to quit for the day after just 11.8 miles. The other reason being that we were trying to strategically plan our approach to Mahoosuc Notch which is thought to be the most difficult and/or ""fun"" mile of the entire AT. Mahoosuc Notch is a huge mile long pit of nothing but boulders in various sizes; some the size of cars, making boulder hopping the only way to get through. I have also read that because of its location and lack of sun exposure, snow and ice can sometimes be found in the Notch as well.  There's never a dull moment when hiking the trail...
 We are camping tonight at the Gentian Pond Shelter/Campsite. As indicated in the name, there is a pond and the pond has beavers, lots of beavers, as well, the pond happens to be our water source. Our obvious concern is proper treatment of the water. I chose to filter and boil. ""Scooby"" filtered, treated chemically and boiled. The good news?  The privy is close by.

We got off this morning at 6:15 not that we had an enormously exciting day ahead of us. For one thing, we would cross the border of New Hampshire and Maine just six miles into our day. As we arrived we were just getting ready to take a few pictures with the sign when a couple of SOBO'S arrived as well. Here we were all excited about Maine being our last state while this terrific couple were excited to have completed Maine and their first state. ""Toad"" and ""Birdie"" are newly married and hiking the AT is their Honeymoon. I took their picture at the border sign and they took ""Scooby's"" and mine. 
 The next exciting adventure for the day was the challenge of Mahoosuc Notch, known as the most difficult mile of the trail while at the same time as the most fun. It was certainly challenging that's for sure. But, we had to get there first. The climbs were average, but rain was imminent. We also knew we wanted to take our lunch break before getting to the ""Notch"" to get some rest before tackling it. Full Goose Shelter would be the ideal spot so off we marched. The clouds began to darken while you could just feel the rain in the air. Distant thunder rumbled and we just knew it was time to break out the rain gear. The sky split open and spilled a torrential rain upon us. It wasn't the fact that we were so wet, it was the fact that now the ""Notch"" was going to be. Difficult enough on a dry day, those boulders would now be wet and slippery. To top things off, I fell  into a bog while attempting a jump across it. I ended up with one leg on a big board while the other was in the bog... past my knee. It took all I had to recover myself. I was stuck big time. The bog and I fought like crazy. We both wanted the shoe on my left foot and I wasn't leaving without it. 
I won in the end, but did I ever need a bath. Oh, and my buddy ""Scooby"", he had free entertainment for the day. I think I would have laughed just as hard had the ""shoe"" been on the other foot...his that is. Once at the shelter we ate, rested and talked to some SOBO's about the ""Notch"" since they had just come through it. It was time now to make our way the last 1.5 miles there. Once we arrived at the ""Notch"", trekking poles were folded up and stowed in our packs. This one mile stretch is a boulder field that requires concentration and extreme caution. You literally climb over, around and crawl under boulders the size of small cars. This Notch is so isolated that sun doesn't reach it. It's also really cold in spots... so cold that there is still snow and ice down there. ""Scooby"" tried to make a snowball, but it was too hard packed and more like ice. It took us right at two full hours to make it through that one mile. It was exhilarating and rewarding to complete this section to say the least. We are camped at a stealth site known as ""Bull Branch"" where we will get rest so as to prepare for a major climb in the morning. Mahoosuc Notch has a brother called Mahoosuc Arm. This is a 1,500 foot climb in just over one mile. Very steep... but fun!!!

I was well rested when I woke at 4:00 AM. I made a few edits to my journal first and then grabbed our food bags from the tree we hung them on the night before. The first business at hand was to make my cup of Joe. I absolutely love my early morning coffee while sitting in my tent.  There is something about it that just seems normal when compared to the rest of my crazy day. ""Scooby"" and I were ready and on the trail at 6:15  knowing that our early morning hike was going to start with the Mahoosuc Arm climb. I set a pace that got us through it in good time, but it honestly was not as bad as we had heard or read.  It might have been that it didn't seem so bad because of our ""fresh"" legs or perhaps it was that cup of coffee or those cherry frosted Poptarts that made it feel easy. 
 While coming down Old Speck toward Grafton Notch, some Sunday morning day hikers told us of someone doing trail magic at the parking lot. That got our attention, especially once they mentioned doughnuts and coffee. We started to run down the mountain with high hopes of getting in on that action. When we arrived we met ""NOBO Joe"" at his car that was loaded with beautiful, scrumptious trail magic. ""NOBO Joe"" just finished his thru-hike on July 2nd and wanted to pay forward all the trail magic he had received. It was a real special treat that means so much to us thru-hikers... thank you ""NOBO Joe""!!!
 So far Maine has been a beautiful state with really good trail conditions. We made the mileage we did today because of those conditions and fairly reasonable elevations. You never know what to expect from the trail. What I do know is that tonight I'm camping next to a brook with the cleanest, clearest, and coolest water you could ever imagine. Plus, who doesn't sleep better when next to the sounds of a babbling brook?  So far so good in Maine.

We had such grand plans for the day, but as it turned out, Maine had other plans. I guess our entry into the final State of our journey yesterday was a facade. Look, I'm kidding OK?... thru- hiking is supposed to be difficult, otherwise you can just go for a walk down the sidewalk. But we really did have a couple difficult climbs that just plain wore us out.  Our grand plan was to hike 18 miles, but quit when we found a tent site at 14.6 miles.  We found what might be considered a ""campsite"" and made camp at 5:30. The site was so small that we just barely fit both tents. That's OK though because all we wanted to do was sleep. 
 So what did today look like? We climbed up big mountains and then we climbed down big mountains. Pretty uneventful to be honest. We didn't see a single NOBO, but did see 7-8 SOBO's. 
 That's alright, tomorrow is another day, and another day of hiking gets us closer to Katahdin and most importantly, closer to home.

Wow, did I ever get a good night's sleep. I slept from 7:00 PM till 4:30 AM and was energized for the day. I had actually gotten up to the sound of rain at 3:00 AM and was concerned that it might have been a soaker coming our way. It ended up being a light rain which ended quickly and I went right back to sleep. Here's a story for you...
When ""Scooby"" and I left Gorham and the White Mountains Hostel four days ago our plan was to hitch a ride yesterday into the town of Andover to do another short resupply that would take us the additional two days into Rangeley. But, we discussed changing our plan to go directly to Rangeley which meant we would have to stretch our current food supplies an additional two days. It could be done, but it would be close and to be honest we would be hungry...real hungry. However, we both signed up for the plan and hiked toward this common goal. My food bag was so low and light that I could give you the exact inventory of what was in it. It was hardly enough for the average person and certainly not enough for a hungry hiker. I was going to have a half lunch and half dinner to make it work. Well, don't you know that as we are hiking north three NOBO's that we know are slack packing south for the day and they tell me that ""Snowman"" is at the bottom of Bemis Mountain waiting for me and ""Scooby"" with trail magic. It turns out that ""Snowman"" follows Trail Journals and has been following my journal. We ran down that mountain and when we got to the bottom there he was with a grill fired up and ready to go. Hamburgers, hotdogs, soda, chips and bananas. Here we were thinking how hungry we were and how little food we had left and along comes ""Snowman"". What a blessing!!!  ""Snowman"" has been providing trail magic for some time now and tries to get to the trail head once or twice each week during hiking season. He will keep up with Trail Journals to see who to expect on those days.  Well today was our lucky day.  Thank you ""Snowman""!!!   It's kind of crazy but this happens to hikers all the time. In a time of need the Lord (through his Trail Angels ) does provide. AMEN!!!
And now a poem:
Trail Angel
I made my choice, it's all on me,
you followed along, I did not see. 
I hike each day and do my best,
while you work before me and never rest. 
It's always when I least expect,
You show yourself and earn respect. 
You do not owe me a single thing,
but, here you are with the joy you bring. 
I know not how to ever thank you,
for how you give and for what you do. 
You give me hope, faith and love,
for you're the Trail Angel sent from above.

This morning we had just 4.8 miles to Maine Rt. 4 where we would walk the .3 miles (there is a difference between walking and hiking .3 miles) to the Hiker Hut to pick up our mail drops. I know I can speak for both myself and ""Scooby"" when it comes to praising the support we get from our families.  Unfortunately for me, my wife and I live in Nova Scotia making it logistically difficult for her to support my hike. Fortunately for me my daughter-in-law Lauren lives in South Carolina and has been my lifeline with mailing me my drop boxes. She is the mother of my beautiful granddaughters, works as a pediatrician, volunteers her time at church, runs her household and makes time to help me. I'm also blessed to have my sister Susan's help and support. Susan is a family doctor, wife, runs her household which includes having recently moved to a new home that requires renovations and a lot of her time. But, she also finds time to help make my journey easier and more manageable. I've said it before and I'll say it again, how blessed am I?  ""Scooby"" has his wife Kellee who he counts on for support and she never lets him down. His drop boxes are always at the pre-established location and his needs are always met. The support we get is imperative to a successful thru-hike and so greatly appreciated. 
After we picked up our boxes, we caught a shuttle to our hostel, The Farmhouse Inn. Stacy and her staff run this two hundred plus year old farmhouse that is off the charts charming. Stacy is beyond accommodating, especially with shuttles to town for meals (including an ice cream run). Once checked in, we were shown to our room where we were able to get showered and then off to do our laundry. I've explained what a Nero is in past posts, but let me cover this again. A Nero is a day to recharge, regroup, resupply and reorganize for the miles that lay ahead.  It's an opportunity to chat with other hikers too, but at the end of the day, it's still a work day. A work day with very few miles to show for it, but so very necessary.    
 Our plan is to take the 6:30 shuttle back to the trail head and hopefully get in fifteen miles over some tough climbs including Saddleback Mountain and The Horn. But of course there are thunderstorm warnings for tomorrow.  At least I'm warm, safe and dry tonight...

The Farmhouse Inn provided everything we needed for a respite from the trail. But, all good things must come to an end. ""Scooby"" and I were up at 5:00 and agreed that the rain was not going to stop our forward motion. The weather report was calling for rain all day, but we both really want to get home. The other 15-20 hikers there were planning on a ZERO for the day, but ""Scooby"", myself and ""Crispy"" were ready to go at 6:30 when Stacy agreed to drive us back to the trail head. It was ugly outside, but we had mountains to climb. With it being cold and wet, the only solution was to work up some body heat. Saddleback Mountain was pretty tough, especially the exposed ridge that was fogged in and freezing. The rocky surface was wet and slippery so we moved cautiously, but still made good time. I wanted to take some pictures of the heavy fog but, that would have required me to stop and I wasn't about to do that. We were up and over The Horn and Saddleback Jr. as quickly as we could and lost ""Crispy"" along the way when I finally had to stop to put gloves on. We did catch up with him later at Poplar Ridge Lean-to where we stopped for a quick lunch break. When I say quick, I mean quick. It was way too cold for wet hikers to sit around.  We were shivering and had to get moving again. The rain finally broke while we were doing our last eight miles to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to.  Once there, we all fixed dinner and made for our tents to try to warm up. 
Tomorrow is a big milestone day for us. We will hug the 2,000 mile mark while also getting to the ""less"" than 200 mile to go mark. We talked about this over dinner last night with all of us in a state of disbelief. More on that tomorrow...

We were off to the races (on the trail) at 6:30 this morning. This would be the last full day of climbing the Bigelows of Maine. Tomorrow we will have right at 8 miles of climbs and then things level off for us for a while. But, back to today first... a couple of today's climbs were pretty intense starting with a steep climb up and then back down Spaulding Mountain. South Crocker before lunch and then North Crocker immediately following lunch kept the blood flowing. The best part of the day though was passing the two thousand mile mark. We also now have under two hundred miles to go. When ""Scooby"" and I got to the 2,000 mile mark (according to our GPS on Guthook), we formed the numerals 2,000 out of sticks and took a few pictures in celebration. Speaking of pictures, the photo on this posting is of Princess Poppy and some of the wild mushrooms we see along the way. FYI, I have mentioned Princess Poppy in past postings, but as a reminder, she belongs to my granddaughters. I take pictures while hiking and send them along to help keep them engaged and a part of my hike. Princess Poppy has been a terrific travel companion, especially since she doesn't weigh that much. That being taken care of, we still had six miles to go for the day with four of them real steep with thunderstorms lurking. The thunder would roll along while it shook the entire mountain under our feet. It was time to move and to move up that mountain as fast as we could or risk a soaking. I'm not sure where the energy comes from after a long day of hiking, but you reach down and grab it and you just go.  We won that race fair and square too. We made it to the Campsite and pitched our tents with a couple minutes to spare before that rain. With dinner in its rightful place (my stomach), I spent a bit of time looking at the miles that remain. I'm in my tent planning the end of my hike and I'm in a state of disbelief. Weather permitting, we should summit Mt. Katahdin on July 25th. In the meantime, I am going to do my best to enjoy the rest of this journey.
