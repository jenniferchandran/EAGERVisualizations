Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479844,"I've got 26 months to get ready. I am going to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, from Springer Mt., GA. to Katahdin, Maine. I'm all in.
So there, I've put it out there. Now it's time to set the wheels in motion and start the process of realizing this lifelong dream. 
The plan is to put my professional life as high school journalism teacher/coach and tennis teaching pro on hold for five months, from March 1 to August 1 of 2017.
The time is right, as I will be free from debt and still plenty young enough (turning 57 in April of my journey) to crank out 2,178 miles, up and down mountains, with 25-plus pounds on my back.
The first time I saw an AT thru-hiker, I was 11 years old, traveling the Blue Ridge Parkway with my family. My parents were both school teachers. We spent three consecutive summers camping, traversing the U.S. in 1969, Canada in 1970 and traveling from Nova Scotia to Virginia in 1971.
I have not done much camping since those summers, but it's time for my walk in the woods.

Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482628,"Part of my daily routine now is reading about the adventures of those hearty souls who are on the currently on the AT. Folks like ""Griswold"" and ""Lucky."" They are braving a rough winter.
I now fully realize this crazy adventure is my destiny. And I may start earlier than March 1 to avoid the bubble.
I planned on spending time on the AT in mid-March during our high school spring break, but I am scheduled for neck and hand surgery on Friday, March 6.
I am having disc replacement (c5-c6) and carpal tunnel release. Got to get humpty dumpty back up on the wall. My hands have been bothering me for almost two years now. Numbness, pain. Hope this gets me over the hump and back on a healthy track.
I want to go to Mountain Crossings as soon as possible and begin the process of getting my tent, backpack and sleeping bag. What better place to do my initial shopping and get going. So much to read up on and learn about. I have read Bill Bryson's ""Walk in the Woods"" and Paul Stutzman's ""Hiking Through,"" as well as seen the movie ""Wild.""
My only hiking experience of the last 30 years was a 14-mile trek on the AT Christmas morning, from Humpback Rocks to Waynesboro and back. Good to see the white blazes.

Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483003,"It's 2:02 a.m. and I do not feel like sleep will come tonight.
That's quite all right. It's the perfect time to read Appalachian Trail Journals nd put together an entry myself.
Just 16 hours ago, I had surgery here at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital to have the spinal disc between c5 and c6 removed and replaced with a cadaver bone. All things considered I feel pretty damn good.
Much better, in all likelihood than I will feel two years from now as I trudge the initial steps of my AT thru-hike. If 2017 is anything like 2015, it will be a cold, wet start. I have tremendous respect for those up on the trail now, following their dreams. Your passion for life is inspiring, and I want what you have.
To the person who donated this cadaver bone for my spine, I will be forever grateful, especially as I make my five million steps and venture 2, 178 miles to reach Katahdin, Maine from Springer Mt., Georgia.
According to my surgeon and several other doctors, I am quite lucky that I did not break my neck four years ago and end up paralyzed when I took a horrific fall at Crested Butte Ski Resort in Colorado.
In a white-out, drunk on a few late-morning Bloody Mary's, I made a cocky, ego-driven turn on the concrete-like slope and flipped head over heels and landed on my neck. I went numb from c5-c6 on down. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I laid motionless on the slopes, pondering my life in a wheelchair. I kept telling my girlfriend at the time, Kandie, that I could not feel anything, yet I continued to move my hands, she said. 
Slowly, the feeling returned to my entire body.
I skied in fear for the rest of the week, with no symptoms from my fall. For the next two years, in fact, I had no issues as I enjoyed my obsessively active lifestyle, which included tennis, golf, skiing, biking and, ultimately, a little hiking.
But two years ago, my hands started tingling, weakening and sighly numbing. As I got into biking, the symptoms literally caught fire.
As I type this my fingers burn. I hope that will subside as the swelling from the surgery settles down. If not, I will still maintain an attitude of gratitude, lucky to be able to dream of making my thru-hike.",,Tallahassee Memorial Hospital,"Mar 07, Sat",0
Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486299,"I will turn 55 tomorrow and the time for change grows closer with each passing day. I love my job as the Leon High tennis coach and journalism teacher. Two passions to pursue in a great place that I call home. Very grateful.
Our boys tennis team won yet another district title earlier this week and I am very proud. We will be the conversation if we advance to the state finals, and another very talented team is in the works for next year.
After that, it's time for my walk in the woods. The morph will be on. The bucket list awaits.
I am just under a month out of neck/hand surgery and the recovery has me frustrated. Hands still numb, aching. Hate it. Folks tell me to be patient. I will take what is left. Hoped to bike across America next summer. Don't know if that will pan out.
Ready for the energy level to rise. Got to get back to full speed, whatever that means. May 20 is the day they will cut me loose again for full activity.
Until then, I will just have to Skrap it out.
Loving the AT journal entries. Inspiring. Reading them daily.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Thu",0
Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501869,"The surgeon cut me loose for full activity one month ago and life is good again. Feeling quite blessed, actually.
I have been playing tennis, hiking, biking, running and lifting. Looking forward to being on the trail in 2017. Going to make that dream come true.
For Father's Day, my youngest son got me a hiking book and a gift certificate to the local outfitter.
Bought a Snow Peak Gigapower Lite Max burner. Love it. Cooked my spaghetti dinner on it tonight.
Also hiked 21 miles at nearby Torreya State Park 10 days ago. Felt great to be out there.
Looking forward to section hiking the AT from Neel Gap to Unicoi Gap and beyond with my nephew, Greg, and one of my former tennis players at Leon HS, David Berry, at the end of July and early August.
So it is early in the preparation game and I am having fun putting the pieces of the puzzle together slowly and one step at a time, just like my hike.
Will have to make the big purchases next: sleeping bag, tent, backpack. Will be researching much of the next month. Suggestions are welcome.
Have continued to reach AT journals daily and marvel at the stories. Recently found out that another one of my former tennis players is thru-hiking the AT right. She promises to coach me when she is through. Life is good. So grateful.",,Life is good again,"Jun 22, Mon",0
Skrappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508554,"I used to think golf was stupid. I could not watch it on TV and I certainly did not want anyone to ask me to play. Then, when the overbearing boss on my first job kept asking me to play, I caved in. And one day, I got it. I not only understood the obsession, I became obsessed myself.Well, the exact same thing has happened to me with hiking.After hiking from Springer Mountain to Neels Gap last weekend with my nephew, I totally get the hiking thing. The obsession is stronger than ever.It started last Thursday, when I drove from my home in Tallahassee, Fl. to the Mountain Crossings outfitters. There, I met Jason, who spent almost three hours with me, talking about every piece of gear I would need to complete my journey.I walked out of the store with my Big Agnes tent, summer sleeping bag, Sawyer water filter, titanium pot, spoon, enough food for two days on the trail, a how-to book of the AT and a list of everything I would need for my thru-hike in 2017.I also set up camp just behind Mountain Crossings and awaited the arrival of my nephew, Greg, who was driving in from Charlotte.Over the next 48 hours, we had a blast. We built a fire when he arrived and I showed off my new gear. He even bought me a headlight to add to my collection.My 6 a.m. alarm did not go off, but we broke camp and met our shuttle driver, Sam, on time. He drove us for 90 minutes to the parking lot near the southern terminus at Springer Mt.We were on our way shortly after 9 a.m.The weather was spectacular, nothing like I am sure it will be in March of 2017. I quickly gained tremendous respect for all thru-hikers as I trudged up and down mountains with 25-plus pounds on my back. Greg, an outdoor enthusiast, was great company.Two hours into our hike, I had a blistering headache. I am a coffee addict and had none in our haste to get out of camp. So we stopped by a stream, boiled water, sipped coffee and took pictures.Then we strapped our backpacks on and promptly got lost, briefly. We hiked until 5 p.m., reaching the Gooch Mountain Shelter and I pronounced we were done for the day. I was toast, resting my sore back on the hard shelter floor.Greg would have none of it.""Uncle Kevin, this is kind of soft,"" he said. ""Shelters are for Boy Scouts. I'd feel like we were cheating on this test run if we stayed here.""I could not believe what I was hearing. I'd read countless journals. This is not soft. This is a great first-night destination. You can't be serious, my friend.But youth prevailed. Gooch Gap would be our destination, he said.And so we trudged on and on and on.Finally, we arrived. But we had no water. I had left the trail guide, the AT bible, in my car. We didn't know where water was. No hot meal tonight.But Greg went on a little search and emerged with two smart water bottles full. We built a fire, ate turkey teriyaki out of a bag and talked until we were too tired to talk anymore.More learning at dawn on day 2. The pocket rocket ran out of fuel after we made coffee. No hot oatmeal. Cliff bars for breakfast and we were on our way again.The trail delicacy became tortilla and peanut butter. I ate it like a starved prisoner.I have never had such a deep appreciation of water in my life, especially after eating so much peanut butter, and especially after running out, again.We experienced our first trail magic midway through the second day. White milk jugs left by park rangers filled with fresh water. More tortilla and peanut butter. More mountains.We encountered Blood Mountain. That was a major challenge, but well worth the climb. The shelter was incredible, the views spectacular.As I lay on my back on an enormous rock, close to hitting the way, Greg turned to me and said, ""You want some bad news, Uncle Kevin?""Sure.""You're going to be two years older when you attempt your thru-hike,"" he laughed.Kindly, he offered me the last of the tortilla-peanut butter sandwich and we made out way down Blood Mountain and into Neel Gap.When you can hear the motorcycles, you know you're close. The downhill trek was wonderful. I was amazed at how many folks were out on the trail, some of whom were actually running.When we got to Mountain Crossings, we enjoyed a coke and a Klondike Bar. I took off my shoes and pointed to my swollen big toe on my left foot. I broke it years ago and it can get cranky.""You need to get that thing drained,"" Greg said.""My podiatrist has already x-rayed it,"" I said. ""He doesn't think it will be a problem for my thru-hike.""Said Greg, ""Neck surgeon, chiropractor, podiatrist... how many doctors do you have?""More laughter.We had hiked 31.7 miles and learned a lot.I like my new gear. My ultra-light sleeping mattress (the name I can't recall off hand) feels a little skinny, like a surf board, and will take a little time to get used to. But I trust Jason and I think it will be a wise investment. The Big Agnes tent is a great lightweight purchase, as is the sleeping bag. Happy with the pocket rocket, as well as the hiking pants my brother gave me for Christmas.Greg departed for Charlotte early Sunday morning to get back to his girlfriend, Emma. Me? i didn't have to be to the Atlanta Airport (for my trip to see my parents in New York) until 9 p.m., so.... I decided to hike 5.5 miles to Tesnatee Gap and back.Again, I had more to learn. I did not bring water with me as I slack packed. On my way back, dehydrated, I asked some hikers if they could spare a sip of water. One fella had me reach into the back of his pack and take a large bottle of Aquafina. I was grateful beyond words. I hope to be able to return the favor some day to another fellow hiker. Everyone I met on the trail was encouraging and engaging.I get it now.I'm obsessed.",,Neel Gap,"Aug 04, Tue",0
