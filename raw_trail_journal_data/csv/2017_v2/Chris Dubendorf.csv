Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559967,"Drove down to Georgia with dad and started at the approach trail at Amicalola Falls on April 7. Pack weighed in at 39 lbs. I will be sending some stuff home when I get to a post office. Officially started the AT on the 8th when I got to Springer MtnThere are a lot of hikers out here but I have been able to find a spot to pitch my tent every night so far. The view from the top of blood mountain is worth the climb. Tough climb down thoughGot to neels gap on Tuesday but decided to keep going and camp that night. Glad I did many hikers who stopped and ate there got sick but I did not Very happy with all of my gear choices. Tent sleeping has been very comfortable with two mattress pads inflatable and foam. Tent was worth the price, spacious and condensation free so far. Weather has been great just a sprinkling of rain last night when I got to camp. Camped at Whitley gap shelter which is over a mile off the trail and a bit of a climb too. It was a decent spot but not worth the hike. Called a shuttle found in the guidebook at noon today when I reached hogpen gap. Another hiker, teddy rose was there- I met her yesterday and she camped at low gap shelter which is further up than Whitley gap but she got the sickness and backtracked to hogpen gap for relief. She said the backtrack was the toughest 4 miles she has hiked and she has thru hiked the pacific crest trailThe shuttle took us to a gas station/ dollar store where we could resupply and then to the cabins where I am staying tonight and recharging my batteries. My first trail magic- the shuttle stopped at tesnatee gap which I passed through yesterday. The driver was going to offer water to any hikers there but we only found one guy who was finishing a section. He gave me his remaining stove fuel and sunscreen which I neededHave met a lot of hikers, both section &thru. A few from Germany and one from Canada. A lot of hikers started in pairs or are grouping up but I am enjoying being solo I will continue to post updates when I have good phone signal","Whitley Gap

Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561233,"Crossed into North Carolina this week. So far the fire tower at the top of Albert Mtn near the 100 mile mark has been the highlight. Even though the main floor was closed off, i could climb up three stories and get an amazing view. Today at the inn I talked to somebody who camped under the tower last night and said the sunset & sunrise were great. Some trail magic yesterday morning from a dude who had: orange juice, fruit, homemade cookies, and more on the tailgate of his truck at the base of Albert mountain. Very nice. I had orange juice and a banana- I am quickly learning to avoid things that might spread those filthy hiker germs. He even had buckets for our trash. who wants to haul five days worth of trash up a mountain?A lot of the trail over the past couple of days was charred from a fire last year. It's a new experience for me to see that and what is coming to life there this spring. After a dry first 10 days or so the trail has been getting rain around here. Once again I'm glad I got the gear I did. When it starts to rain I don't need to stop- I can be confident my essentials will stay dry in my backpack and frontpack and my rain jacket is in an outside pocket - easy to get to in case I get cold in the rain. It's a good smell when it starts to rain and it's a very comfortable thing to be in the tent and hear the rain on it. At a budget inn tonight and catching a shuttle back to rock Gap tomorrow morning","Rock Gap

Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562270,"Camping at the ""Fontana Hilton"" so a Quick entry tonight. Starting the Smokies tomorrow! Fontana Dam is a cool spot on the trail. All the tent pads here at the Hilton are concrete! My tent uses stakes so for the fourth night in a row I am sleeping on a grade. I need to start getting to camp earlier for better choices. I think the next town I'll hit is gatlinburg tn. There is a shower here at the shelter but I am going to wait. Today was sunny and I was able to dry my wet gear.","fontana hiltob

Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563329,"Taking a planned zero day that has stretched out far too long. Halfway through the Smokies decided to go into gatlinburg for a resupply and stay overnight while a storm moved through (there were calls for snow too.)  able to do laundry and get a full resupply. Very windy storm on Thursday knocked down trees, knocked out power in town and closed the road back to newfound gap. Here on Saturday morning the road is still closed to get back to the trail and I'm looking for alternate options to get back to the trail like going to the end of the trail and hiking south. 
Trying to coordinate with other stranded hikers to figure out the best way to go
The highlight since my last post has been Clingman's Dome. The highest peak on the Appalachian Trail was a relatively easy climb.  The structure at the peak is pretty cool and the day was very clear so I could see very far. I was surprised how busy it was and handicap accessible too.","Newfound Gap

Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566978,"Ran into a couple of hikers, Mike (shared a room together in Gatlinburg) and Kellen who have kept a similar pace to me since Georgia. Zeroing with them since we got into Damascus, VA yesterday. We split a ride to Abingdon, VA and are sharing a hotel room. Saw the new Alien movie with them today and now watching game 2 of the NHL final as I write. So...really roughing it today. 
Haven't posted here since I was in Gatlinburg so I have a lot to cover to get up to Damascus. 
Left Gatlinburg as soon as the road back to Newfound Gap opened back up. SmokiesRoads had its own twitter account to keep us updated. Split a ride with three other hikers I found on Reddit. It was understandable why the road was closed once we got back to the gap. The same storm that had brought 90 mph gusts and knocked out power in Gatlinburg had left a few inches of snow on the trail in the Smokies. 
 The whole section through the Smokies could not have been over soon enough. Between the wet/cold/windy weather and slippery trail and shelter/not tent restrictions it was nice to drop my permit in the box at the end and leave the Smokies behind. 
 Next up was Hot Springs, NC. This was the first town that the trail walked right into and through. It was nice to be able to resupply, do laundry, eat real food etc without arranging a ride but I would not consider this a ""destination spot"" like I saw suggested on a vlog or two. Maybe I am just bitter because I caught a 24 stomach bug there. Left on a Saturday and got about 2 miles along and saw a tent pad beside the river. Set up camp there and slept off the bug from 2pm Saturday to Sunday morning, Mother's Day. 
Next up was Erwin, TN. I like the way a did this town and will try to do this again if I can. I know from the guide book the trail came out right by a hostel so I camped at a ""stealth"" tent pad 2.5 miles out the night before. In the morning I got up early and saw some cool views of Erwin from the mountain on the way down.  When I got to the hostel (Uncle Johnny's) I had all day (a Friday) to get what I needed from the town.  There were some guys there who thruhiked last year and were offering a ride to Trail Days. Trail Days is a hiker event that takes place in Damascus, VA. I said no thanks. I rented a bicycle from the hostel and rode to town for a resupply at the dollar store and lunch at McDonald's where I could recharge my external battery. Also, mcdoubles hold up very well as hiker food.  Hikerfriends Mike and Kellen happened to walk in and we had a good time catching each other up on our experiences over lunch. There were some other hikers there who had rented a car. They offered us a ride to Trail Days.  We said no thanks. Erwin was a good memory for me. Good weather, good music on a good bike ride and some good experiences In a small town. 
 
  I'm finding a groove where I can resupply for fewer days so I have less to carry but still be confident that I will get to the next resupply opportunity before I run out. Especially when I get moving early and have maximum daylight to work with. Just have to deal with the early morning spider webs that always seem to find your face.  I am less creeped out by spiders now than I was two months ago. 
  When I returned the bike to uncle johnnys I also bought a shower and still had the afternoon to hike about 8 more miles. The next section was slow and rainy.  It would have been nice to be able to stop at Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel but it was closed because they had gone to Trail Days. So when I came out of the woods in Roan Mountain, TN I was happy to walk .3 miles downhill to Mountain Harbor Bed & Breakfast Hostel for a stay. And then I enjoyed their famous breakfast which lived up to its reputation. And then I took a zero there and avoided more rain. Also dried out my gear and resupplied. 
  Got back on the trail and knew there was more rain coming so I hiked to the first shelter. Full and then some- lots of hikers had returned from trail days to the same place so there was a little bit of a bubble. Screw Trail Days. I moved on and got a good spot at a camp site for my tent just before the rain really started coming down. I am starting to get the hang of this. The next town up would be Hampton so I was going to try to use the Erwin Strategy again and camp just outside of town and go in early the next day. Mike and Kellen happened to be hiking by after I had my camp set up and recognized my tent.  They had just done a 22 mile day and were planning to get into town because Kellen had to get to the post office before they closed at 10am Saturday for Memorial Day weekend. I am convinced mail drops are just a pain in the neck and not worth the trouble. They squeezed in their tents where I was and we all went into Hampton, TN the next day. Kellen had to hurry to the post office in the morning but Mike and I were able to take some photos etc on what I think has been the most scenic part of the trail so far. Very cool waterfall. Tomb Raider-esque rock ledge beside the river. 
Hampton was a good resupply- despite a lot of off-trail walking. Stocked up on Mcdoubles and other essentials.  I have been hiking near Mike and Kellen since then. We camped at Vandeventer Shelter which overlooked Lake Watauga. Very cool. The next night Mike and I camped at a stealth site and Kellen stayed about a half mile ahead of us where he had a bear encounter. He was there with two other hikers. A bear climbed a tree and took down the bear bag of a girl who had chosen a bad limb. Kellen said he saw one large bear and two cubs. I have not encountered any bears but this is the third time that somebody in close proximity to me has. Nobody was hurt but the hiker who was headed south had to turn around and resupply on food. 
That brings me to Damascus. I'm finally in Virginia. 
No tick encounters but checking vigilantly
Some lucky trail magic crossing a gravel road at the right time on Memorial Day when a fisherman trying to get cell signal saw me and gave me a cold Pepsi and a handful of candy. He seemed concerned about copperheads.

Chris Dubendorf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572142,"Camping in Maryland tonight. 
Got to Harper's Ferry yesterday around 1:30 and met Mom Dad & Samantha at the econolodge.  Awesome. We had lunch together in historic Harper's Ferry and then explored the town a bit. It is a very neat little town and considered the ""spiritual halfway point of the trail."" Mile 1024. 
Samantha went home and mom & Dad took me to Charles town to resupply at Walmart and then we went to the race track and placed some bets. I didn't hit a single one but still had a good time. We got back to the hotel late but it is luxurious to have a good bed. And a good endless breakfast. 
Mom brought permethrin so I could treat my gear for the first time since I started. We did that after we checked out- I expect this to pay off very soon. Bugs have been very annoying- the family also brought me a mosquito head net that I will be wearing even though it looks ridiculous. 
They dropped me off at the trail near Jefferson Rock this morning. I hiked this section with chuck earlier this year- the only section of the AT I had tried before I started- so I am claiming double credit and not going to worry about the ~2 miles I missed coming out of Damascus, VA due to a wrong turn. 
Some trail magic tonight. Two girls were hanging out by the trail in Gathland State Park and gave me a half frozen bottle of water and a beer. They also reassured me that I am on track to make it to Maine in time. I have been concerned about this more and more. I am definitely ""behind the bubble"" (the crowd of northbound hikers) but that may just be a blessing since I am not dealing with crowdedness at waypoints etc.
I had my picture taken at the AT Office in Harper's Ferry. I am the 1576th NOBO hiker this year. A man there also reassured me about making it to Maine on time. He advised me that they will likely keep Baxter Park open a week past October 15 and that I will have the best chance of getting a permit if I am there on a weekday.  Made me feel better for now anyway. I need to be banking miles now so I can afford to slow a bit when I get to the White mts.  The AT Office is a cool and friendly place I wish I had brought the family while they were with me. 
Shame on me for not posting here since I started Virginia. I met a guy in Luray who said he posts daily. Anyway a quick highlight of Virginia...
Grayson Highlands. It will be hard to top that, my favorite part of the trip so far just ahead of Harper's Ferry. I hiked here with my buddy Mike. The terrain was very rocky. It has a very distinct look from the other parts of the trail in the region. We knew there were going to be ponies which there were. They are very friendly- I guess a lot of hikers feed them so they came right up to us but were disappointed. I didn't know there would be a herd of longhorn cattle. They weren't aggressive and I think I only saw females but the first one I saw did catch me by surprise and false charged me as I crossed a field so I ran and put a big rock in between us. I got through the ""Fatman Squeeze"" a cool cave/tunnel feature there. There is a fenced off section of the park where no camping is allowed for a two or three mile stretch so when I caught up to Mike just before that section we agreed it would be a good place to camp. Our fiend Kellen hiked in a little later. Good guys to camp with. Even though it was an established camp site with a fire ring and log benches etc the rockiness made it hard to find a good spot to pitch a tent. Mike and Kellen's spots were decent but bumpy. I set mine up on a grassy pathway just next to the site that looked like it was wide enough for vehicles but I didn't expect to see any that night. After we ate, hung our bear bags and got in our tents we found out that the path was used by the longhorns. The herd of 20 or 30 came through and my tent was right in their way. Some were less happy than others that hey had to go around me. Also, like the ponies they seemed accustomed to being fed by hikers. In the morning when we were eating breakfast the herd came back through in the other direction. They came up to us trying to get food. Some of them nosed around in the fire ring (we didn't have a fire) as if they have learned that hikers put food scraps in there. They hung around as we took down our tents and packed up. One of them false charges at Kellen. They were harmless but still intimidating. I should also mention that Mike thought he heard a bear next to his tent that night but it was just a pony that laid down next to his tent at midnight, just chillin out. 
I'm having trouble embedding this video but here is a YouTube link, just remove the space between ht tps: 
ht tps://youtu.be/V5kfpvN452EI saw my first bear just south of mcafee knob.  I woke up early to hike in and meet my dad who had come down to hike mcafee knob with me on Father's Day weekend. I woke this bear up- he was in a tree about 25 yards from the trail. He jumped out and ran away.  Since then I have seen about five more not too far from the trail. I saw the first rattlesnake on tinker cliffs the next day. Since then I have seen a few more of those as well and right in the middle of the trail.  Most of the wild life sightings were in Shenandoah national park.
