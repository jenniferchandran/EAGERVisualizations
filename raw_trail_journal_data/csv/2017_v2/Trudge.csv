Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553576,"I've always had thru hiking the AT in the back of my mind since I was a teenager. I'm retiring this year and plan to make the attempt. Busy now researching the hike, obtaining gear, and practicing with it.",,Home,"Jan 02, Mon",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553581,"Wanted to test out some of the new gear I've recently purchased, and the weather forecast was promising. I drove to Thornton Gap in Shenandoah National Park and hiked in to the Pass Mountain shelter, set up my tent, cooked dinner and breakfast, filtered water. Overall, everything worked well, but my feet got cold in the early morning. I'm cursed with cold feet and need to figure something out for that.",,Pass Mountain Hut,"Jan 18, Wed",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553582,"Went to an REI lecture on AT Trip planning, where I heard about this site. The lecture was informative and has gotten me to start making some concrete plans about the start of my hike - the specific start location and date. I will plan out an itinerary for the first couple of weeks of the hike and then see how I need to adjust my expectations.I've just ordered some goose down sock booties to see if they can fix my cold feet at night.",,REI Tysons,"Jan 19, Thu",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555393,"REI at Tysons had another lecture on food and equipment for AT hiking. The speakers were both recent distance hikers on the AT and offered helpful advice. One of the changes I made, as a result, was in my sleeping pad. My first backpack test run was with a Thermarest self inflating pad. It didn't self inflate without having to blow it up and was too difficult to deflate and get back in its sack the next morning. So I bought an inexpensive closed cell pad that rolls up and attaches to the outside of my pack. While bulky, it is still lighter and less hassle than the inflatable pad, and at least as comfortable.For food, I am starting to experiment with various meals that require adding hot water, but dressing them up with adding in extra ingredients like salmon or tuna for dinners, and some craisins into my morning oatmeal. Dressing up these meals this way definitely makes them more palatable and enjoyable.",,REI Tysons,"Jan 24, Tue",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555399,"Drove into Shenandoah National Park to Compton Gap where I started a circuit hike with Jessica. We first hike to see the basalt rock formations and overlooks near the top of Compton Mountain. Then we started a circuit hike that took us on the Dickie Ridge trail to the Hickerson Hollow trail, down some quiet roads and then back up to the AT from Harmony Hollow where we stayed at the Tom Floyd Wayside.The weather was exceptionally pleasant and we had fun reading the log journal entries of previous hikers through the area. This time I did not set up my tent and we slept in our bags on the shelter's floor. It unexpectedly rained overnight, so I was especially glad we had chosen to stay inside the shelter.The food preparations were actually pretty good for dinner and breakfast, enhanced by adding ""extras"" into what came in the basic package that I added hot water to.I also got the first chance to test out the new goose down booties for socks to keep my feet warm. They worked great, but the night was not really cold enough to be a good test. But I'm hopeful that this could work out to be a good solution for my typical cold feet at night.",,Tom Floyd Wayside,"Feb 18, Sat",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555401,"With my friend Ashish, from the Buck Hollow trailhead off of Route 211, we hiked up the Buck Ridge trail, along Skyline Drive and up to the Byrd's Nest #3 hut. During the hike, the temps dropped from 74 degrees at the start to about 50 when we arrived at the shelter. A front had just passed through and the winds were now howling and the temps continued dropping, getting below freezing overnight.Ashish had a new tent he wanted to set up. Since no one else was there and the winds were whipping so much, we decided to set it up inside the shelter. Afterwards, with it being so cold and windy, I decided to do the same thing and set mine up in there too.I experimented more with dinner preparations and again found that taking some effort to spruce them up some helps make them actually taste pretty good.It was dark after we finished having dinner and getting noticeably colder, so we retired to our respective tents pretty quickly. This night turned out to be an excellent test of those goose down booties I had purchased to keep my feet warm. Though the temps got quite cold and below freezing, my feet were perfectly comfortable throughout the night while in the booties.In the morning, it was too cold to wait around for cooking, so we hiked back out via the AT, Meadow Spring trail and the Buck Hollow trail, choosing instead to break our fast at the excellent Northside 29 Diner just north of Warrenton on Route 29 while heading back home.The weather added a bit of excitement to the trip and everything seemed to work quite well for both of us. This was a good test trip and I am gaining more confidence. My next test trip will try to be for more than one overnight. Baby steps.",,Byrds Nest #3,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555570,"Attended another class at REI Tysons where the speaker did a detailed breakdown of gear in your backpack. I pick up a few good tips on some changes I could make to cut down some on pack weight and have ordered a few new items - tent stakes, bear hang line, and fire starting tinder.The class advertised that they would also do a pack shakedown if you brought your packed backpack in, which I did. Unfortunately, that part never happened and I was somewhat disappointed. It would be good to get someone with experience to critique what I am packing. Right now, my base weight is around 23 - 24 pounds. But when I had it packed for about five days with food and water, it gets to about 37 - 38 pounds.Heading out for a couple of nights tomorrow morning where the AT crosses I-66 and will stay at the Manassas Gap and Denton shelters. This will be my first time out for two nights, and I think it will be pretty cold the first night out. It should be a good test, but may also be a rude awakening. We'll see...",,REI Tysons,"Mar 02, Thu",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556999,"Before starting my hike, I wanted to do a two night backpack trip, so I went and hiked about 10 miles with Jessica and Ashish in the G. R. Thompson Wildlife Management Area. Then they headed home while I went to stay at the Manassas Gap shelter that evening. It was quite cold and got down to around freezing overnight.",,Manassas Gap shelter,"Mar 05, Sun",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557000,"When coming out the previous morning to hike, we dropped off my truck where the AT crossed underneath I-66. My hike was to go from Manassas Gap shelter to the Denton shelter, passing my vehicle en route. When I got to my truck, I decided to take a short break and drove to Fox Meadows winery for a few hours (so much for roughing it!), then returned and finished hiking to the Denton shelter. Just before arriving at the shelter, I saw some wild turkeys on the trail.",,Jim and Molly Denton shelter ,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557001,"It rained most of the night at the Denton shelter, but let up at first light. I packed up quickly, skipping breakfast, and hiked back out to my truck to head home. Shortly before finishing, I came across a sign on the trail indicating the start of Mosby's Confederacy territory from the Civil War.Going out for the two night backpacking trip has been a good trial run, even if I did visit the winery. My gear seems to be working OK and I am getting used to carrying my loaded pack. I will still see if it is possible to trim down its weight even more before I start.",,I-66,"Mar 07, Tue",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558044,"I finished packing everything I am taking, minus the food and water. My base weight is 25.0 pounds. An additional 10 pounds or so will be added, depending on how much food and water I need to carry between resupply points.On Monday, I broke down and bought a smaller, ultralight tent - Nemo Hornet 1p - that weighs just over 2 pounds with the footprint. I really like the REI Quarter Dome 2p that I have, but that weighs 4 pounds and I'm sure I will appreciate the weight reduction.Friday morning, Jessica and I will drive down to Daleville, checking in at the HoJo by the trail there. We've arranged a shuttle to leave Jessica's vehicle on the Blue Ridge Parkway so she can hike with me the first day and then she will head out from there while I continue with my hike.I am definitely nervous about how I will do, but I am also ready to get this adventure started. Since backcountry camping like this will be new to me, I just don't know what to expect on whether I will like it. I hope that I fall in love with hiking the AT. But I also know it will be extremely challenging and there will be plenty of bad times too. The first two to three weeks will certainly be a big adjustment as I learn and adapt to life on the trail. At least it looks like the really cold winter weather is past.",,Home,"Mar 29, Wed",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558231,"Jessica is currently driving me down to Daleville, VA where I will start my northbound (NOBO) wraparound hike tomorrow. We're driving through the heavy rains of a nor'easter which is pretty intimidating and I'm glad I'm not hiking today. The weather is expected to be much better tomorrow. Nevertheless, I'm sure I'll have my share of bad weather days.By starting from Daleville, I won't have the traditional hiker pictures on Springer Mountain, nor a finish at Katahdin. My start picture will likely be the in front of the HoJos in Daleville. But it will let me avoid the largest bubble of hikers, cover sections I'm already familiar with as I adjust to a backpacker's life, allow friends to join up with me for sections easily, as well as making the start and finish logistics pretty simple. Also, I will get to see McAfee's Knob and Tinker Cliffs as my rewards as I finish up. Jessica and I have hiked both of those and they are spectacular. Life is short. You never know how long you have. So many of my friends have had their share of significant health setbacks. This is what made me decide to retire earlier and attempt my thru hike now, while I still can. I hope to make the best of this opportunity. It will surely be an adventure.",,"Daleville, VA","Mar 31, Fri",0
Trudge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558504,"My first day's hike went fine, but today was quite humbling. Yesterday, we covered close to 13 miles and made it to Wilson Creek shelter in around 7.5 hours. Afterwards, I was able to fumble through cooking and eating dinner. It got cold as the sun was setting, so we crawled into our sleeping bags while it was still light out.Laying there, I again felt overwhelmed by the thought of continuing to camp out for the next 150+ days and my lack of experience doing so. I didn't sleep well throughout the night as I continued to contemplate the backcountry camping aspect of this adventure. The more I thought about it, the more unnerved I became. I knew I had a last chance to bail out because we were hiking another three miles this morning to Jessica's car, where she was going to depart, while I was supposed to continue on. Instead, I asked if I could ride out with her. I quit today.Well, maybe I haven't quit yet. I know and knew that the backcountry camping is where I lack familiarity. I need to practice it some more and I plan to. I need to be comfortable being out there for multiple nights in a row, in various conditions, and know that I can handle that OK before trying to do it for the whole AT. So for now this is a set back, and a pretty humbling one. I thought it likely I would get off the trail and regroup early on to make adjustments. I just didn't expect it to happen so soon.So for now, this adventure is on hold. I hope I will be willing to try a better effort in the not too distant future.Lastly, I just want to say thanks to all of my friends and family that have offered encouragement and support for doing this adventure. Apologies for all the hoopla for so little.","Daleville, VA
