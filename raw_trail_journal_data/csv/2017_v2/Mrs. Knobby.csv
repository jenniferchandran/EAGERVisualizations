Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482604,"I've been contemplating starting this journal for months. I've actually been writing my thoughts and plans for years. This weekend we are heading to Georgia to the Appalachian Trail Kick-Off, so this may be the perfect time to Kick-Off our journal. I will be posting our weekend events here, and then will post some flashback entries...how we came to know about the AT, what kind of hike we have planned, and what we have been doing to get ready to hike the trail.One week ago I could say we have a tent we've never put up, backpacks we don't know how to pack, a stove we've never lit...and lots of shopping still to do. Obviously we are not experienced hikers. We will not be of those of whom people will say, ""They will be ones to make it!"" Nope. We're out of shape, we are in our 60's, and we have a lot to learn.We sadly have limited time to hike. Dave still farms...central Illinois corn and soybeans...so we have to be home to plant and then to harvest the crops. Bummer! But let's be real...we are going with the expectations we might make it a few days...then maybe a few weeks...and I'd love to be gone a few months if we can!*Quote: ”It’s impossible,” said pride. “It’s risky,” said experience. “It’s pointless,” said reason. “Give it a try,” whispered the heart. – Anonymous",,AT Kick-off,"Mar 02, Mon",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482606,"So this week we are in high-gear preparation phase. I am nearly done shopping. We have been experimenting with our gear. The tent is set up in our basement and we have been packing our backpacks. I am very curious to see what our pack weight will be, and how much we will be having to pare back on our supplies. Today I bought food for a 5 day hike. So what is our plan for the weekend? We will head out Friday morning for a 10 hour drive to Amicalola State Park in Georgia. We will spend Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday attending the various speaker sessions and visiting with the various vendors. Our secondary goal is to hike the Approach Trail. We will climb the steps and hike the 8 miles to the top of Springer Mt. and the beginning of the AT. Depending on the weather, we may begin to hike the trail itself. Yikes! In March? That was never in my plan...to hike in the cold or possibly in the snow. So we'll see.*Quote: ""My goal is to find courage and strength to get through my 1st night.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482640,"I am struggling a bit with the journal. I have written posts over the last few years in preparation for going live with a web journal. So now...where do I start and how do I organize it? These first entries are live time...happening now...regarding the AT Kick-Off weekend we are anticipating. I want to journal about the upcoming days on the mountain, the Kick-Off activities, and then any days that we might spend hiking. Then I guess I will flashback to my earlier thoughts and how this whole thing came to be and what landed us on Springer Mt. to begin with. It's been a long time coming and you will laugh, maybe shudder, and definitely shake your heads at a woman and her dreams...and the poor man she drug alongside her. *Quote: ""It is so easy to romanticize about the hike from my desktop computer or while shopping at REI, but I'm sure reality will hit me that first week on the trail.""BTW, the quotes at the bottom of my posts are all coming from my notebook. My HUGE notebook of everything I've read and know about the Appalachian Trail. So they are not original quotes from myself, but things others have said that I thought were significant.",,Confusion,"Mar 03, Tue",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482893,"Well, we're packed as much as my mind and body can handle. There are a few pieces missing yet, and apparently much that we need to take out because those packs are heavy! I was surprised how much food weighs. We won't need everything that we packed on this preliminary hike, but we want to see what works and what doesn't and decide what we really do need. There will be people at the Kick-Off who will go through our packs and make recommendations for us. We need it, that's for sure!The weather has played havoc with the roads between Illinois and Georgia. But we are hoping that by mid day tomorrow when we will be going through Kentucky and Tennessee, the ice and snow will be cleared off the roads and we will reach Amicalola State Park in good time and in one piece. Speakers start at 7 PM.Last night we stayed with our grandchildren overnight. I was cold in their house and when I went to bed, I did do a little whining about how freezing I was and I had a hard time getting to sleep with my cold nose and hands. I admit I kept thinking, ""This is nothing! Wait till I try to sleep outside in the cold!"" Oh dear.*Quote: ""If you're going to be stupid, you better be tough!""",,Packed!,"Mar 05, Thu",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482957,"We have arrived at the top of Springer Mountain! It wasn't even too bad! Oh wait! That was driving...We had a long drive through some backed up traffic on snow and ice packed roads. We checked into the lodge at Amicalola State Park and went to the Visitors Center and weighed our packs and hiked around a little. We came upon a shelter and found a young man wiping some tears as he had just said goodbye to his loved ones. There are a lot of hikers here who are starting their trek from Georgia to Maine.
To clear things up, we are on a practice hike. we plan to only be here for a few days to learn and test our gear (see first days entry). Then we will return after planting crops.We are heading out now to our first class.*Fact: About 2 to 3 million people walk a portion of the AT every year.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Fri",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483033,"We had our first practice breakfast...poptarts. Yum. Then we listened to a speaker on backpacks which was really helpful. We bought our AT guide book. Whoo hoo! After lunch we headed out to the Approach Trail. Just finding where to go was a challenge. We asked someone how to get to the stairs. He said, ""If you go that way you can climb DOWN the stairs."" Oh, no. Not me. I insist we will climb UP the stairs. It's 604 steps and it was tough. I told myself we would do 50 steps and then rest, which we did. That's a lie! I never made it over 42 steps without stopping to catch my breath. Dave did better and would go ahead and then wait for me. But check out the photo section for today. I was still smiling at the top.We had a good laugh while we were sitting and resting. Dave said, ""We shouldn't have eaten such a big lunch."" I said, ""We only had a little sandwich!"" He said,""Oh, I guess it was the 48 hamburgers we ate before we got here!""When we got back to the lodge he said we should walk to the car to get our hiking poles. What? Walk to the car now? I almost told him to go get them and I would wait right where I was, but then I remembered that this whole thing was MY idea and I quietly followed him to the parking lot.I will try not to write too much every day. I'm still figuring out how to manage this site so PLEASE look at the pictures under PHOTOS! It took me a LONG time to get them uploaded!*Quote: ""All in all, it was about 5 times harder than expected, which is not bad since I told myself it would be 10 times harder than I could expect.""",,The Fun Continues,"Mar 07, Sat",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483076,"Well, I cannot sleep so I will write. Tomorrow is our biggest and final day of this test trip. We have maybe around 7 miles to finish the Approach Trail. With our packs on. We will be heading out in the morning and see how far we can get. The plan is to camp on the trail tomorrow night. After today's hike I can report that I recovered well. My legs are not even stiff or sore. Of course I'm lying in bed right now so I'll see in the morning how I really feel! Dave rolled over in bed tonight and said, ""Can we just forget this whole thing if I promise you a whole month in Florida?"" We both laughed but I think he meant every word!(I have tried repeatedly to get the most current entry to come up first when someone opens the journal but it just will not change. If anyone knows how to do it, please leave me instructions in the guestbook. Thanks!)",,Who Can Sleep??,"Mar 08, Sun",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483226,"What a diet and exercise plan this is! We walked for 7 hours yesterday and went about 7 miles. You could say we are on the SLOW hiking plan. But we were, after all, climbing a mountain.It was the uphill that  killed me. I had to stop and heave air every 50 feet. The downhills hurt my left hip. I guess I liked the flat sections the best! LOL I don't think Dave ever even took a deep breath.The weather could not have been more perfect. My coat and scarf were soon shed  and I hiked in short sleeves all day. The most valuable gear were my hiking poles. They saved me from several falls. So far, I haven't fallen, I haven't cried, I refrained from spitting, and I prayed a lot of ""Help me, Lord!"" I also could not do without my bandana. I'm blowing my nose constantly. There's  nothing glamorous happening out here. Now we are in our tent with a little rain coming down. I am toasty warm in my sleeping bag and slept really good. I was so glad. Until I looked at my phone and it was 12:45 AM. Now I'm in for a long night I'm  afraid. Can't play on my phone as I am supposed to be saving my battery.  All is well and I am still thankful to be out here.*Quote: ""It is OK - perfectly OK - to stand talking to someone while their nose is dripping on their coat. It isn't even worth mentioning.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483323,"I did sleep off and on, hearing the light rain hitting our tent. Thankfully, we were staying dry inside...no leaks! It was still mostly dark outside, but I was feeling anxious about getting packed up for the day. Our stuff was everywhere! If you know my husband, that is not his style! Order, please! That's what he likes. So I started fumbling in the semi-darkness, sorting through things and pulling out what we would need for hiking in the rain. Soon Dave started stirring and we made eye contact. I was thinking he was going to say, ""This is crazy! This is not for us! What are we doing out here in a tent in the rain!"" But he leaned over and gave me a little kiss. And I knew it was going to be a good day. I am welling up with tears now just remembering my relief and love for him for being ""in"" on this wild ride.We walked down to the privy together (real romance!) and saw that there were 5 hikers sleeping in the shelter and 6 tents around the campsites. We apparently were the first ones up. Thankfully, the rain stopped and it was just slightly misty. We got everything packed into our backpacks, put on our rain pants just to stay warm, and headed out to the trail. We had a mile and a half to go to the top of Springer Mountain, where the real AT begins. Then there was another mile to hike to get down to the parking lot where we would get a ride back to the lodge and our car.We had heard it was a steep climb to the top, and I was nervous. I had already learned that uphills were hard for me, and Dave had to constantly stop and wait while I gasped for air. But it wasn't that bad. Not easy, but doable. We got to the top...the rock where it all begins for Northbounders, and ends for Southbounders. There were several hikers up there celebrating and getting ready for their thru-hike to Maine. I was a little jealous (well, a lot jealous) and it was so deflating when people asked us how far we were going, and we lamely said, ""We're going home."" It just felt sad. But we got our picture taken at the plaque, and then we were off to the parking lot. This was the coolest trail of all, so far. All downhill, so that made me happy. It was wet and muddy and full of slippery rocks and roots that you just had to find your way through. It was challenging, but fun and I could keep up with Dave. Yay!We caught a ride (our first hitch) and hit the road for home. We arrived about 10:00 PM, tired and stiff and thoroughly pleased with the whole experience.I have lots more to say and questions to answer, so keep coming back! And thanks for all your prayers!*Quote: ""We're not dead yet!""",,Springer Mountain!,"Mar 10, Tue",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483407,"We got down the mountain roads and onto the interstate. It was around 12:30 PM. And that’s when Dave became mayor of the roads. Dave drives the interstate very seriously. He watches every vehicle, its placement, its speed, its moves…and he talks.“Why is that car moving there?” and “That blue van is speeding up and slowing down, speeding up and slowing down.”“Just relax,” I said. “You don’t need to manage every vehicle on the road.”Dave: “Look at that guy! He needs to make up his mind what he’s doing!”Me: “Don’t worry about it. Just drive!”Dave: “Did you just see that truck pull out to pass? Now he’s gonna go 1 mile an hour faster than that other truck and slow up all the traffic!”I finally said, “YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE WOODS!!”And we both started laughing and looked at each other, knowing no one will ever know what we really went through the last few days. It was hard but it was fun, and there was a lot of laughing together. We need that sometimes.So we are back home and I’m sorting and cleaning our “stuff” while Dave has started a trucking job hauling concrete. Back to reality.Now to answer a question: Are there other people around?Yes, especially this time of year. According to Trail Journals, 167 hikers are starting this month. And that’s just registered hikers on their site. So there are actually many more, and the majority of AT hikers start at Springer Mountain and hike north to Mount Katahdin in Maine. Besides those, there are lots of day hikers and hikers doing sections of the trail. We were on the Approach Trail, and there are fewer hikers there, but still we passed, I mean were passed, by lots of hikers. At our shelter there were about 15 people sleeping in the shelter or in tents. But we heard that on the actual AT, one hiker saw 72 other hikers in one day.Fact: Generally 1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail successfully completes the journey.*Quote: ""People keep asking me how much fun I’m having.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483502,"Let me tell you about some of the people we met at the Kick-Off and on the trail:Sir-Packs-A-Lot – he is a thru-hiker and runs a new hostel called Top of Georgia. AWOL – another past thru-hiker who has written the most used guide for the AT.Miss Janet – woman with a van who drives up and down the trail giving rides and help to hikers.Other speakers and vendors.At Black Gap Shelter and campsite there were:Two college age guys out for a weekend hike.An upper-20’s year old gal who had quit her good job and was thru-hiking alone to Maine.A 40-ish year old man who came in tired and worn and grumpy, laughing with us at his cussing tirade against the 604 stairs and 7 miles of trail he had hiked that day. He sat at the picnic table, loudly proclaiming it almost killed him! He didn’t have much water supply, he said he was doing it against his doctor’s orders, and he put up his tent and went to bed, although we could hear his groaning and moaning for a couple of hours. I’d love to know how far he gets!When I left our tent to go to the privy before bed, there was a 30-ish year old woman sitting alone by a nice fire. We said hello, and then she engaged me in a long conversation. She is German, and talked fast, so I didn’t catch it all. But I did look in amazement when she lifted her pant leg and she had a prosthetic left leg. She told me she was an avid adventurist and had ridden a bike across the US 3 times, along with lots of other feats she rattled off that I didn’t catch. She lost her leg only 15 months ago in a rock climbing accident. Her harness broke and she had a free fall that should have killed her. She was happy to be alive and was trying to be the first person to successfully thru-hike the entire AT with a prosthetic leg. She offered me a swig of her Italian liquor she was drinking, but I politely declined. During our classes, we watched the experts go through a woman’s backpack and advise her on what she needed and what she should leave behind. One of the things the guy pulled out was a camp chair. Too heavy and not necessary, he said. We met this girl later on the trail and her husband was the man who gave us a ride back to the parking lot. He said she had been planning and training for her hike for 2 years. He was unable to go with her as he had a job he couldn’t leave. He also said that she put the camp chair back in her pack. She wasn’t going without it!All along the trail, we met people coming and going, and always there was a quick, “Where are you going? How are you doing? Have a safe hike!” It feels like a community out there, and though there may be a strange one or two along the way, the trail does not feel unsafe, at least from other humans. I found the terrain much more concerning than the people!*Quote: ""Getting to the top of those steps hogged all the brain cells I had allocated for 'Thoughts, Dismal and Dark.' I literally stopped every 15 – 20 steps and sucked in massive amounts of air. At one point, I noticed a pack of cigarettes on the ground, obviously chucked there by a hiker, finally convinced to give up smoking. Or maybe he just died right there and those fell out of his pocket as they lifted his body onto a gurney. Either way, he had given up smoking, I was sure.”",,People We Met,"Mar 12, Thu",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483616,"I’m just sick about it that I don’t have more pictures. How did that happen? Because I didn’t have any pockets for my phone/camera. As soon as I ditched my coat the first day, I had to have Dave carry my phone. Now remember, I was slower than Dave. I was holding him up. He was patient and kind, but sometimes you gotta be smart. And asking for my phone to stop and take pictures didn’t seem like the best idea at the time.So after looking at pictures, reading and studying and preparing for years for this adventure, when I actually got there I didn’t get to document it like I wanted to. We hurried too much and were too nervous about it all to relax and take all the pictures we wanted. So first on my list of things I need is pants with deep pockets in them, that I can get to with a backpack on. This picture is on the Approach Trail from Springer Mountain to the parking lot. You can see how rocky and full of roots it was and we had to pick our way carefully. But it was all downhill, so I was loving it. There are more pictures in the photo section for today.*Quote:  A wise man said, “You know, idiot, you are hiking the Appalachian Mountains.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483693,"Many have asked about what we ate while hiking. I had done all that reading and had carefully shopped for food that we could pack in our backpacks, that wasn't too heavy, and would be easy to fix. The plan was Poptarts and oatmeal for breakfast, wraps with chicken or tuna and cheese for lunch, and noodles, mashed potatoes, or other packaged food we could just add hot water to for dinner. Very easy. Well we never bothered with the oatmeal for breakfast and we ate the Poptarts while resting after hiking awhile. For lunch we had the wraps. The chicken was from a package and was yucky. Smelled and looked a lot like cat food. We wouldn't have eaten it at home, and it wasn't appealing on the trail, either. But that's what we had, so we put that in our tortilla wrap. The cheese had been packed way too far in advance, so I had decided the day before to throw it all out. So we had tortillas with chicken, and some of our snacks of candy bars and snack mix. When we got to our campsite, I was ready to get out our little Jetboil stove and make dinner, but Dave was not into it. He is a minimalist, for sure, and thought it was unnecessary to make anything hot. I was all about pleasing him so he would continue the trip  so once again we just snacked on what we had. So we will revamp our eating plan. Cold cereal with powdered milk in cold water, more Poptarts, and maybe some prepackaged meals that I test before we go out again. If it isn't something we would eat at home, it's not going with us.I'm sure we will be hungry when we get to towns and hot foods are available.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483801,"This is just a list of simple things we learned on our hike:1.We did good at keeping our pack weight down. Mine – 26 pounds. Dave’s – 29 pounds. And we learned a few things we can do to get them a little lighter yet.2.It is OK, and in our case it worked perfectly, to carry your water bladder on the outside of your pack. We had it strapped to one side of Dave’s pack, opposite the tent poles.3.Fill up with water at any good source you come across, as you might not find another good stream before you run out. Drink up at the source also to stay well hydrated.4.Hiking poles were essential pieces of gear for us.5.A scarf or headband for my hair is essential for me.6.A bandana was another essential item while hiking.7.I need to carry my own phone if I want to take pictures while hiking.8.I need pants with pockets so I can carry my phone!9.There often isn’t a signal in the mountains, so you can’t always make calls or update the journal while hiking.10.Rain pants, if clean and dry, are good for sleeping in to keep warm.11.Put the tent on level ground to prevent sliding off the sleeping mat.12.Take waterproof gloves.13.You don’t HAVE to eat hot food while hiking on the trail.14.You CAN poop in the woods if you absolutely HAVE to.15.Don’t say to your hiking partner, “I don’t think you’re going to make it!” I MADE IT JUST FINE!

I guess I was afraid of a little pain??(Don’t worry, it’s just aspirin, Ibuprofen, Aleve and Alka-Seltzer. And I came home with this much, so take that as proof that I’m not a pill addict!)Physically we did great! Better than any of my expectations. Our feet did not hurt. No blisters. Knees held up fine. No twisted ankles. Heartburn under control.

I took that along because we were expecting it might be cold on the mountain in early March. It was beautiful weather, but the scarf did do its job to keep my neck warm and the hair out of my face.Let’s discuss my hair. I don’t have hair suitable for the trail. It’s not “brush-it-back, pony-it-up and it looks great” hair. Cutting it all off is not an option. I’ve been growing it out for months and it almost goes in a pony tail, but it is still straggly and falls into my eyes.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484131,"If you aren't real tech savvy at home, you won't be a whiz at technology in the ""wilderness"" either. There are a lot of gadgets and products out there that hikers can use to stay in touch with home and the outside world, some for safety, some for entertainment. People bring Kindles, or tablets, Ipods, etc. There are GPS systems specifically designed for the trail, cameras that attach to your hiking poles, and on and on. Our form of communication, as well as our camera, is just the cell phone. Because you only get to town and an electrical outlet about every 4 - 5 days, I plan to get an external battery to give me longer charges. I have lots of storage on my phone, so I can download books, movies, and music for long evenings in the tent. Getting a signal on the trail can be difficult. Mostly, the phone will be turned off while hiking, but turned on at the mountain summits or open spaces to check for a signal. There could be a few days when communication will not happen, and journal entries may be delayed for awhile.I'm sure there are hikers out there who have good ideas and suggestions of useful products...sign the guestbook...I'd love to get some help from you!*Fact: The more you carry, the more you will enjoy your camping.          The less you carry, the more you will enjoy your HIKING!",,Can You Hear Me Now?,"Mar 18, Wed",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484237,"I think I've answered about all the questions we've gotten about the trail, except for one: Why on earth would we even think about doing such a thing?So my next journal entries will tell about our journey getting to the trail. If you're interested, keep reading. Otherwise, I will let you know when we get back on the trail for real, next time.Fall, 2010We are thinking about taking the challenge of walking the Appalachian Trail. I have several initial thoughts. First of all, “walking” is a misnomer. The more I study and read, the more I realize this is not an easy walk in the woods, but there is lots of strenuous climbing, lots of navigating over rocky terrain, lots of slippery, treacherous pathways. I wonder if we can physically do it.And there are bears. A lot of people are excited about seeing bears. I am just slightly anxious about the bears. But mice! It sounds like there are lots of mice, and this year I’ve read two mentions of rats in the shelters. I’m extremely anxious about the rodent factor. I will be sleeping in a tent rather than a shelter wherever possible. There are also snakes to consider, but those don’t frighten me as much. So the “wildlife” is a concern.Then there is the weather. I read of snow, and I hate to be cold. Lots of rain, which is obviously wet, and wet clothes and feet do not sound fun. In fact, some people have damaged their feet for life walking the AT. Some complain of heat and humidity during the summer months of the walk, but I tend to enjoy the heat. Dave, on the other hand, does not. I do realize, though, that “enjoying the heat” isn’t considering carrying a pack on my back, fighting dehydration, or not having the luxury of respite air-conditioning at the end of the day, or showers, or decent bathrooms.So the conclusion is that we will start the trek with high hopes and enthusiasm. However, if at any point we find it too hard, too scary, too dangerous, too lonely, or just too crazy, we will make our exit without regrets and our heads held high, with some good stories to tell, I’m sure.The planning and the dreaming have been fun anyway.*Quote: ""There will be plenty of times the trail isn't fun. There will be tough stuff and fun stuff. Good days and bad days. But if it's something you really want to do...almost a passion of sorts, then you have a good chance of getting through it to the end.""",,The Dream,"Mar 19, Thu",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484383,"March 28, 2011I am reading AT journals. Some are more fascinating than others but I am learning from all of them. There are “rules” for walking the trail, it seems. A thru-hiker walks the entire trail. A strict thru-hiker will skip no miles, take no short-cuts, follow every whiteblaze sign. I would normally be a strict thru-hiker. I like things nice and tidy and want to be able to say I did it perfectly. However, as I read journals, it seems that people who are a little more relaxed with their rules have more fun and more experiences. I hope we will last a while on the trail, that we will adjust to the difficulties of walking and sleeping in the woods, and that I will allow myself to be spontaneous and flexible. BUT, truthfully, I am pretty bossy. I like a plan and I like to stick to it. Poor Dave.A common saying on the trail is HYOH, or “Hike Your Own Hike.” No peer pressure. No unnecessary rules. It’s a good concept and hopefully we’ll remember it when we enter the trail culture. I ought to start practicing now!*Quote: ""Determination is a powerful thing!""",,HYOH,"Mar 20, Fri",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484509,"Related to yesterday’s post and the concept of HYOH, I am taking the risk of sharing another quote from my readings of Trail Journals. Now, I have to say, I have been posting quotes in nearly every entry here. Without permission. My apologies. I have no idea who might have originally written them. So if I quote you, any Trail Journal people, I hope you won’t be angry but will take it as a compliment. Here is a quote of someone concerned…OK, a little angry…at hikers who obsess over perfection on the trail. Thank you to whoever wrote it in their journal…I am trying to learn ahead of time how to roll with the flow!""There are a couple of things that annoy me: Weather Nazi and Map Guru. They are usually combined in one but occasionally could be separate. These people listen religiously to their radios and obsess over their elevation profiles on their maps. Now there is nothing wrong with either of these except when they proceed to tell ME all the useless information they have learned. The weather is for some town far away or hundreds of feet lower in elevation, so it is usually wrong. The elevation profiles usually make the climbs and descents seem worse than they really are. I don’t care about the weather report and I don’t care about the elevations! I just hike. If it is raining and steep climbs, then I’ll climb until I’m tired and cold. If it is a beautiful day, then I’ll hike until I’m tired. I just walk; why make it more complicated. It’s about the journey, the people you meet, and the experiences, not about doing 20 miles, day after day. I think that’s stupid.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484769,"FUN FACTS•The trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.•Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the AT every year. •More than 250 three-sided sleeping shelters exist along the trail. •Virginia is home to the most miles of the trail (about 550), while West Virginia Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest. •The total elevation gain of hiking the entire AT is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest 16 times.  Wait! What?? Like climbing Mount Everest 16 times??Here is a picture of me in the summer of 2013. We had just climbed 130 steps to the top of Starved Rock in central Illinois. Yes, I was putting on a little bit of a show with my ragged, worn out look for the picture, but seriously, it was not easy dragging my overweight body up those steps. It did not bode well for climbing the 600+ stairs on the Approach Trail of the AT. Let alone climbing the equivalent of Mount Everest 16 times!So it’s off to the gym and the sidewalk for the next several weeks to get myself in better shape for the upcoming hike. We don’t have the hills or rocks or roots to navigate, but if a lighter pack makes the hike easier, I suppose a lighter body will help too!*Quote: ""At 10 AM I had the thought, ""This is the worst idea you have had in years!""",,Doesn't look good!,"Mar 23, Mon",0

I’ve read many journals where the hiker has dreamed and planned and told everyone they are going, and then there they are back home…either it was too hard, their knees gave out, their feet were blistered or injured, or they got too lonesome. Some just hated it. Some last a few days, some a few weeks, and a very few go all the way. All of our family and friends know about our AT plans. I don’t want to humiliate myself. I want to give myself the option to come home and say it was awful (and I know that in some ways that is sure to be true), and I would never do it again. I want PERMISSION to say that, but I hope and believe that the opposite will be true and it will be a great experience. *Quote: I'm 4 weeks from starting and I'm obsessed with thinking about the AT.

Before heading for home we made a special stop in Hot Springs, NC. I was so excited. My very first steps on the Appalachian Trail. We followed the trail down the Main Street and stopped in at the Bluff Mountain Outfitters and looked around. We would have liked to do some hiking in the immediate area, but I was recovering from a broken foot and we played it safe instead of stupid. You can see those black shoes...the only shoes I could wear all summer. They were definitely not hiking quality. But it was a highlight of my summer. I hope someday we can actually hike through Hot Springs as real hikers.*Quote:You might be a hiker if...you have eaten your weight in ramen.

I have asked myself that many times. It is recommended by those who have done it to know your goals and know your motives. Well, I haven’t been able to figure it out myself why I am so obsessed with the idea of hiking the Appalachian Trail. It is a crazy idea. We are not really the outdoorsy types. We are not in shape physically to expect that we can even do it. We don’t have any of the gear that it will take to do it. I like how I feel in the woods. I think I will like the challenge of it. But I don’t really understand why I am nearly insisting that we try it. But I do know why Dave is doing it. For me. Period. It’s not something he would have ever dreamed up on his own. He is learning a lot about it through my research and incessant talking about it, but I know it is not his desire to pick up and take off for weeks or months, or however long we stick it out. He is simply obliging my desires. And I love him for it. ""The mountains and woods have always been a source of peace, solace, and renewal for me.""

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485481,"There are options for bathrooms on the trail. There are some campgrounds along the way with a real life bathroom a hiker can use. There are hostels, where you might share a bathroom with several other hikers. There are hotels…the expensive ones with nice tiled bathrooms and lovely toilet paper…all you want to use. But more often you will find yourself in a “hiker hotel,” with bathrooms of lesser beauty, and cheaper toilet paper, the kind that tends to fall apart with use.And then there are privies, or outhouses, at most of the shelters along the trail. They are of all styles and types. Check out the photo section for today, 3/28, to see some of the more unique versions of outdoor toileting.And of course, there is the “go in the woods.” As one hiker said, sometimes this is the cleanest and most preferred option over all of the above.

The trail is not about the wildlife, but more about the people and the challenge.*Quote: ""About two tenths of a mile from the shelter we saw a momma bear and her cubs.

Black bears are big raccoons; they’re on a mission from God only to dig through trash. They don’t seem to realize, or at the very least care about, their strength. Watching a 300 lb black bear scamper up a tree because it sees a 130 lb female backpacker in the distance is one of life’s great mysteries.""But to be safe rather than sorry, there are some instructions should you encounter a bear on the trail. A threatened bear displays signs of distress such as pawing at the ground, making noises, or charging. If this occurs, back away slowly from the bear, never turning around or running. Never stare at a bear, but talk in a soft, comforting voice. Slowly change your course of direction. From a distance, yell, wave your arms, or throw sticks at the bear. Never climb a tree. Leave your pack on. Talking, singing, or whistling while hiking will be enough noise to warn a bear of your advance.*Quote: ""The bear isn't after you - he/she is after your food. Bear logic says - as long as YOU have the food it's yours (unless the bear can scare you away from it), but if he/she has the food then it's THEIRS. And they're willing to fight for it. You don't REALLY want to wrestle a bear, do you? If you can scare him off while you still have the food - cool. But once he has the food, don't challenge him, just make plans to pack the trash into town. And get lots of good pictures.""",,Let's Talk Bears,"Mar 30, Mon",0
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485994,"I confess again, that I steal a lot of good writing from Trail Journals I have read. It's about 5 years of past reading that are showing up a lot in my posts.Today it's the mice issue. I don't get it. They are disease-spreading, dirty little creatures that I don't want to sleep with. Here are some mouse entries I made note of:""I was worried about the mice in the shelter...they are in every shelter due to all the food hikers leave out or behind...I am more afraid of the mice than I am the bears...I am always listening for them and never get a good sleep. Someone had written in the shelter log that they had been bitten by one of the mice/rats while sleeping and their finger was bleeding...how can anyone sleep after reading that? That is why I prefer my tent.""""In the shelters, you hang your backpack from metal cables dangling down from the ceiling (food bags are hung outside and high in a tree). Each cable has an upside down tuna can midway down the cable so the mice can't go down any further and get into your pack without falling off directly on you and your sleeping bag down below. Great system, huh? It's not at all unusual, I am told, to find a mouse licking the salt from your face while you sleep. God knows that if you ate a cracker, or something, before you went to bed and dropped any crumbs - you are definitely going DOWN! Forget the bears, and they are definitely around, it's the mice that can be the most frustrating. Most shelters come with a broom to use to sweep out not only the dirt from your boots but more importantly, food crumbs."" ""By far, the most destructive creatures on the AT are small mammals, such as mice, raccoons, and porcupines. Mice are found in abundance in most shelters and cause a lot of havoc with hiker equipment and food supplies. When storing your pack in the shelter, leave it open so that rodents don’t chew holes in it in an attempt to explore its contents. Also, don’t sleep with your head close to the shelter wall as this area tends to be a mouse highway and they have no qualms about running over your face as you sleep.""

The last morning of our trip we hiked at Dogwood Canyon. The trail was listed as 6 miles long. It was a paved, level path through a manicured park. We walked a total of 7 miles, but the last 3 we left the paved trail and hiked through the woods on an unpaved path that was much more challenging. The first ½ mile was a steep climb and hard, but we made it. Afterward we were very proud of ourselves and we both claimed that we weren’t even stiff or sore. But comically, after we stopped for lunch and sat there awhile, we both had trouble getting up and getting going again.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/486489,"One of the big problems, healthwise, on the trail, especially at the beginning, is blisters on the feet. Sometimes BAD blisters. Most people come prepared, with boots or shoes they’ve broken in, and with moleskin or blister bandaids to treat any blisters that do show up. Some hikers wear liner socks under their thicker socks. Let’s just say, blisters are something to deal with on the trail.I broke my foot a couple of years ago. It still sometimes gives me pain. When I bought new hiking boots, I got a blister the very first day I went out for a walk in them. So I was a little worried about my feet on our practice hike last month. I ended up wearing my good pair of walking shoes that I know fit and do not hurt my feet. They were brand new so had good tread on them. People warned me that it is essential to have footwear specifically designed for hiking…boots, or trailrunners. But, here’s the thing, I had zero trouble with my feet. No pain at all and no blisters. No turned ankles or fumbling on the rocks and roots. So what do I do? I think I will start out with the shoes I know I like and if they break down, or let me down in any other way, I will get something better at one of the town stops.

It just depends on the foot the shoe is going on!At Neel's Gap, where many hikers leave the trail after about 30 miles in, there is a tree full of boots, abandoned by disillusioned hikers, or replaced by determined ones.My notes say this:Your #1 MOST important piece of gear – your SHOES! Footwear should provide ankle support, arch support, and good cushioning. Soles should have good, deep tread. The toe box should have adequate room without allowing too much movement for the toes. There should be a sewn-in tongue or collar to keep out debris and dirt.

We made a sudden decision to go to Oak Brook Terrace where there is a large REI store. I had my list and we took off for the day. We arrived at the store about 10:30 AM. Our first venture was into the shoe/boot department. The salesman told us to try out the boots on the rocks around the corner. I took a peek around the corner, saw the “rocks,” and immediately welled up with tears. Why? It just filled me with joy. Such a sap!We moved on to the tents, sleeping bags, mats, water bladders, headlights, and landed finally at the backpacks. Salesman Ron was helping us. He was an experienced backpacker and taught us a lot…and also upsold us on every item he possibly could. He was having a great sales day! By this time it was 1:00, we were all hungry and overwhelmed, and even Ron was ready to see us move on, I think! I wasn’t convinced in his backpack choices and fitting and it was time to go! We stopped at a Subway for a sandwich and then drove further north to Schaumburg where there was another REI store. We met a delightful young salesgirl, also experienced, and she taught us even more. We exchanged our sleeping mats, and bought sleeping bags and backpacks. The gal was unaware that the mummy sleeping bags were able to be zipped together into a large double bag, and we had fun trying it out and seeing her complete surprise and excitement when it was successful. She was very helpful on choosing a backpack that fit us and was much more reasonable than Ron’s options.We got home around 7:30 PM and laid everything out on the dining room table. Oh my. It was a little scary. You can check out the picture under the photo section 4/6/15.From my notes: How much does it cost? It takes a fair amount of money—from $2000 to $9000—to undertake a 2,000 mile, five- to seven-month hike, not counting $1,000 to $3,000 or more for gear. It depends a lot on where you eat and where you sleep. Spending a lot of time in hiker towns can add up the dollars.

Falling off the mountain, hypothermia, lightning, murderers, crazy people...we COULD die, you know.”   “Yeah but...”   “And I think you know that you should think about these things before we do this.

We have been athletic most of our lives - running numerous marathons, triathlons, 1/2 ironmen, ultra-marathons,and backpacking. We each have a Harley motorcycle and have ridden to all 48 states from Germantown, TN (no trailers allowed). At present time we are hiking as much as possible with our packs weighing 25 lbs. in parks with trails near our house. Now...Let's compare that to Dave and I:Dave is 66 and I am 62.

I've gone twice, and yesterday did 6.5 miles of trails there. They look similar to the AT in Georgia and NC. It's up and down, roots and rocks, and under tree cover for shade. I've had some interest from some who might want to hike with me, at least partway. Contact me if you're interested!Right now my biggest concern is leaving my husband Dave home for an extended amount of time. My solution to that problem is that he will come out often to meet up with me...he can be a support and drop a few ""trail magic"" goodies while he's visiting. So far he's been supportive of the plan. *What is Trail Magic?  “Trail magic” is the little acts of kindness that people perform for hikers and is one of the best things happening on the AT. Trail magic is administered by “trail angels,” who are often long-distance hikers themselves. These acts span the whole gamut of good deeds, from free food to shuttle rides, to overnight stays in a private home with a hot shower, a meal, and a bed. Basically, trail magic is any wonderful happening, stroke of luck, or act of kindness on the trail, and can be deliberate or serendipitous.

There are several people who are on my list to possibly join up with me. Some of them won’t have the needed equipment, or want to spend the big bucks for a tent to use for just a few days. If I go with a little bigger tent, I can share my space if I have to.3. I read that a 1 person tent may not be the safest option for a female on the trail. Better not to advertise that I am a female alone in my tent. It may not be a realistic fear, but the thought stuck with me, so I decided ""better safe than sorry.""So I once again exchanged my tent, from 1 person to 2 person.

I will try to do that on the trail as much as I can; at least write and post later if I have to.4. I broke a rule of stopping for a rest. I didn’t stop and look around when I started hiking again.

All was great until I got into that tent and then the struggle began. I spilled a little water on my sleep mat. So I hunted for my towel. Ruschle, ruschle, ruschle. Seemed like I ruschled through that pack for 30 minutes, making a lot of noise. I found the towel and cleaned up as good as I could. Then I found some things that should have been put in my food bag but it was already hung up in the air, so I hid a few things under a log back in the woods. I blew up my mat, laid out my sleeping bag, and tried to climb in. What a fight! My sleeping bag and I need counseling, big time. You may have noticed I carry a bandana. When I walk outside, my nose runs...constantly. Well, here I'm definitely walking outside. I'm blowing my nose all the time in that bandana. When we ate our meals last night, we both had too much water added and it was a little soupy. So my snot rag became my bib. Later, I had to go to the privy one last time. My wet wipes (I brought no T.P.) were up in the bear bag. Uh-huh. Now what? Well, there's always the bandana. That thing is tucked far away now, not to be used again until I can do laundry. Thankfully I have another bandana to hang on my bag for my nose. Then with one big gust of air, and it got cold. Between the cold, the stupid sleeping bag, my back hurting a little and my hip hurting a lot, I got about as much sleep as I do at home. Not much. Tonight I'm sleeping next to a man who is very quiet and hasn't participated much in the shelter community. (They are discussing mice right now. I'm trying not to think about it.)That's the update. I'm doing fine and glad to be here. Thanks for any and all prayers!It was a very good day!Falls - 0Bears - 0And I'm not headed home yet!Ignore the miles section at the top. It's not right. Guess I have to figure that out yet.","Stover Creek Shelter

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526903,"Let's talk about the shelter experience. Oh boy. There was a crowd because rain was expected. There were 6 hikers squeezed into the downstairs and 5 squeezed into the loft. And 2 on the floor and tents all around for people who got there late. There was Mickey, the social director. He says, ""Who brought a banjo?"" He kept all the fun going.There was the young trail buster...everything was GREAT with him. There was the quiet guy in the corner who pretty much stayed wrapped in his bag. There was a gourmet cook, with a chair and a camp tray and all kinds of makings for his supper. He also knew everything about camping and he liked to tell us. There was an older man in the other corner who said he was having leg cramps. About 3 times during the night he moaned out a pitiful, ""Oh, OHHHH."" I felt so sorry for him because he really couldn't move to relieve his pain.Neither could I! I was tucked in tight between two men. Whenever anyone moved in their sleeping bags it made a lot of noise. I was very careful to stay in my space and be as still as I could be. Thankfully the snoring wasn't too bad, and the mice didn't bother me until morning, when they were running around getting into everything. I'm glad I didn't know about them during the night. It did storm for a bit, and it was windy and cold. It was an experience being in the shelter but i certainly prefer my tent.Today was another nice day for hiking. And boy did I hike. Tonight we are in a hostel in Dahlonega. It's nice. There are 24 hikers here, getting out of the cold. What a hard day of hiking today. There were two mountains ... Sassafras and Justus. And it seemed like the rest of the hike was mostly uphill too. The hardest thing for me are the uphills. I have to say it was a long, long day, but I made it!That's it.

The weather again was nice for hiking. We were planning on all camping together for two nights but the prediction is for cold temperatures and lots of wind, so tonight we are back at the hostel and tomorrow night we will be at the mother, Alice's, house.Some have asked how we get to and from the trail each day when we stay off the trail. The way the hostel shuttle, or private shuttler, works is they pick you up at a place the trail comes out to a road. They take you wherever you are wanting to go. In the morning they return you to the same trailhead. That afternoon they will pick you up however far you have hiked for the day. They travel up and down the trail many miles. So you can stay at one place a few nights and not miss or repeat any miles. We see people we've met out on the trail, everybody just doing the best they can. Usually they are passing me and I say, ""I'm pretty slow!""Yesterday one guy replied, ""You might be slow, but you're lapping everybody at home!""Well, right now we are in a vehicle heading for town and a good meal.

And we hiked with day packs instead of our big ones, which made a huge difference.I had heard there were lots of rocks, and there were, but nothing I couldn't handle. I think my legs are getting stronger and even my breathing might have been a little better. I didn't have to stop so often to rest. The views were spectacular. Alice thought maybe I have exercise-induced asthma. She thinks I should see a good pulmonologist and get an inhaler.

There weren't any tears, and there wasn't any blood, but it was a VERY hard day of hiking. We did only 7+ miles but mostly uphill. The last mile was a cruel, steep climb. Here's what it's like to hike for Mrs. Knobby: Go, stop, breathe, blow nose, go, stop, breathe, blow nose, repeat 1000 times. I finally sent Pam on ahead and told her to wait for me after 30 minutes. That worked well the first time, but the second time I needed a pit stop and for that I would need to take my pack off and if I did that I would want to eat lunch. PAM, WHERE ARE YOU?

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527983,"I have time, internet, and lots to tell!First of all, I will go back to the night we were in the Blood Mountain cabin. When we called, they were all booked up, but with the weather report predicting storms they asked around and a man said he would share his cabin with us. Not to scare the worry warts, we left that part out of the story. We wondered who it would be and we were delighted when Living Proof answered the door. He has a very interesting story. He is a brain cancer survivor and he attempted a thru-hike last year but took a bad fall and broke his shoulder. He is back again this year, but was laid up for a few days healing some badly blistered feet. He was so charitable to let us in, thankful that we could share the cost with him, and gave Pam and I each a bedroom of our own and he slept on the couch. I added a picture of him in front of our Raccoon cabin.We saw him again on the trail today. He said he still needs a few days of healing so was going to hole up again in the next town.Then there was Storm and Trooper. He is 38 years old, a weather guru and hiking to Maine. And he's helping along a woman who is...well, let's just say she struggles like I do. But she is a Trooper, indeed. And he is a delightful young man. He goes ahead, drops his backpack, comes back for her pack, takes it ahead, and then comes back to cheer her along up the trail. He is hiking the trail 3x over! And laughing and having a ball all along the way. I was so impressed with him. We camped out two nights and did well. We did 7 miles Tuesday and 11 miles Thursday. Whoa. That's a lot for me at this stage. And the stench! Bad! I desperately needed a shower and laundramat. So the plan for today was to hike to Unicoi Gap and get a ride to Helen, GA. Helen is a unique little tourist town that mimics a German/Swiss town. It was one of the places Pam wanted to see. (I'm conveniently blaming her. )When we got down to the gap, there was Trail Magic! A hiker feast set up in the parking lot...hot dogs, hamburgers, sausage, bacon, all kinds of fruit and sweets, as well as toilet paper, toothpaste, anything a hiker might need. Oh yes, and COLD DRINKS! I had about an inch of water left in my bottle and I was thirsty! Wonderful!We hinted around that we were looking for a ride to Helen, and finally one of the persons serving up food said he could take us when they were done. So we waited there a couple of hours. And then did we ever get a ride! He not only brought us to town, but gave us a thorough tour. Up and down nearly every street. He even invited us to go in and see his church, but seriously all we wanted was shower, laundry, and bed! We were very grateful to him though, as the farther we get up the trail, the fewer shuttles or rides there are to find.So we are in a motel tonight and have finally arranged a ride back to the trail tomorrow, where we will tackle Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain. Still hiking! And tonight, a positive quote!*Quote: I asked him what time it was. He answered, ""Half past awesome and a quarter to paradise.”","Blue Mountain

The driver very happily agreed to pick us up this morning and drive us back to Unicoi Gap. Once we had that all arranged, we said, ""And we'd like to be picked up at Tray Mountain Rd.""Then we got an, ""Oh, ma'am, that's a very bad mountain road."" After a few minutes of telling us the trials and woes of driving up that road, he did agree that he would come.So we started out this morning and hiked up Rocky Top and Tray Mts. We were faster than we thought and now we are waiting on the mountain top for our driver to appear. He thinks it will take him an hour to get up here. Very treacherous! I hope he is exaggerating. This is Pam's last day of hiking. She has to go back to her ""big bad job,"" as she says. Tomorrow she will shuttle back to her car at Amicalola.

Today I hiked with Helen and Eddie from Mississippi. They are short section hikers and we hiked nice and slow. On the uphills, Eddie was out ahead, then Helen, then me. When Helen stopped, I stopped. Eddie had lots of patience. Now he didn't have just one slow woman on his hands, he had another dragging along behind. On the downhills, I took the lead as I like downhills the best. At one point, my water bladder fell out of its pocket, so I had to stop and take off my pack and get re-situated. Along came Eddie, holding up my water filter which had also fallen out of the pocket, unknown to me. I was so thankful that I had gone in front, and that Eddie retrieved the filter for me. I would have been in a world of trouble had I been the last in line and it had been lost. Lesson learned...the filter will always be in its proper zippered spot from now on. I wondered if they felt I was intruding on their hike and I tried to sometimes be out ahead or a little behind to give them their space.

They save me every day from falling.Ok, here's the chapstick story. Day 1 and 2 of the hike were windy and sunny and my lips took a beating. But I was focused on the trail and just trying to get my bearings, so I didn't think about the chapstick in my backpack. By day 3 I had enough sense to get the chapstick out, but by then my lips were chapped like a little kid's who has licked his lips until there is red chap like a mustache. I pulled out the chapstick and lo and behold it was red tinted! Where did that come from? Not good! I put it on but when I covered all the soreness around my lips I looked like a clown with big red clown lips! That's a little too much glamour for the trail. I picked up a good tube of regular chapstick and that dilemma is solved. One of the ladies in the shelter is talking about how many times she has cried on the trail. I can say I have not cried yet.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529781,"Ok. I made it up Albert Mt. On my own. Well, with help of a few trees to pull myself up over the horrid rocks. They were lovely big boulders but no place to put your foot to climb up and over. I'd stand at the base and just study and study and test it out. It was a challenge but I tried to be sure every step was secure before I pushed off. And I did it! Yeah!All day I heard, go to Long Branch Shelter. It's new and the stream of water is really good. Well, yes, the shelter was built in 2012, and the stream was great for getting water, but the tent sites were awful! There were hardly any and those were down steep hills and were either muddy or uneven. Somehow I was first there, and I grabbed the flattest, but dirty one. There was literally one tree limb fit to hang a bear bag, and no one was there to watch me, so for the first time, I attempted to throw a rock over the limb. Pam had done it for us the first two weeks and since then I have been able to play the grandma card and walk around asking if anybody sees a good tree to hang a bear bag, and always some nice guy volunteers to hang mine with his. (For those who might be wondering, it is wise to hang all your food, your toiletries, or anything that has a scent up in a tree so that bears or other critters can't get to them.)I got the rock over on the third try. Not bad. But my bag was too heavy (from fresh resupply) and I couldn't pull it up and it felt like the limb was going to break. Back to Plan A. A nice gentleman hung mine with his on the same tree limb, just at a different spot.Dinner went fine in the shelter until I heard that there was a trail magic cooler of cold drinks back at Mooney Gap. WHAT!! How did I miss that?? Oh a Diet Coke would have been such a treat.A young crowd arrived and moved into the shelter and I was sick and tired of fighting the ridiculous hilly campsite, so I crawled in my tent at 6:15 and I was out. Sound asleep. In the morning the battle continued. Uh oh. Our bear bags were stuck in the tree. It took some real work to untangle them and get them lowered. The poor guy was trying to be nice to me and he almost lost his own bag.Then I visited with a lady who was out hiking with her husband. Yesterday was her first day to join him. She said her legs were sore because she did 17 miles. Well, that depressed me! I couldn't even think of doing 17 miles and I've been out here 3 weeks. I packed up all my stuff, dirty and muddy, and climbed the wretched hill out of that camp. I got just a ways down the trail when I realized I didn't have my glasses on. Oh no! They could only be still in the head netting of the tent or they were on the ground somewhere back at my tent spot. So I stopped right there and had to unpack my pack and pull the tent out. Yes! I could feel them in the tent. But the tent was all zipped up and I had to wrestle with it to get it all right side out, unzipped, and pull the glasses out. I got my pack all loaded again and started out down the trail. But in all the frustration, I didn't see the ""Shelter"" sign which is where I should have turned north. So I walked about 50 yards the wrong way until I caught it and got turned around. And since then I've been doing my thing, hiking up and down hills. Hate the ups, like the downs. My husband says hate is a strong word. Well, today I'm going to stick with hate. It was on a flat spot, though, that I took my first fall. Whammo, I was down. I have no idea what happened. But there was a young girl hiker right behind me and we got my pack off and I got up and I am perfectly fine. She assured me that she fell a few days ago and I could see the scratches and bruise on her leg to prove it. It's true. We all fall down out here sooner or later. A fall without injuries...phew! I was relieved.I've been sitting near the top of this mountain writing. The breeze feels good and I think I'm about to start a long downhill. Things are looking up!It is very tempting to call for a ride back into Franklin. Holiday Inn Express! But so far I'm resisting. I'll let you know...Well, it's not the Holiday Inn, but yes, I'm at the Budget Inn in Franklin. I told myself if there was a ride at the gap, I'd take it, and just as I arrived Ron Haven's free shuttle to the Budget pulled up. And I said YES!!Now for some good news.I passed 100 miles when I got to the top of Albert.And I woke up this morning and my heel did not hurt!

What on earth?! And I mean that literally! But I was too tired to worry about it and just pitched my tent where I wouldn't have to see it. It was a long day of hiking.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530169,"So today I did another 10+ miles. I just don't seem to improve on my speed or my stamina on the climbs. But you've heard all that before...I had one incident this morning that some of my friends will get a kick out of. I was just getting a good start on the hiking when I heard a growl right behind me. Startled, I turned around and it was a big Boxer dog. Well, you know I was scared of it! I hollered at it and it backed off a ways but stood in that attack mode and kept his eyes on me. I heard someone whistling for him then, and I said, ""Call your dog!"" A man came up the trail and said, ""Oh he's friendly! The most he would do is lick you all over."" Well, he wasn't acting friendly and I don't want to be licked by a big, strange Boxer dog! I am at a shelter area tonight in my tent. All the people here I have met on the trail. My tent is on a slant so I am having quite a time getting situated.You may remember that my sleeping bag and I are working on our relationship. It is a Cats Meow 20 degree female bag. So what's the problem? There are about 4 issues. #1. It's so poofy and bulky that shoving it into my pack's special sleeping bag compartment every morning is a monumental and exhausting task. It just takes up so much room! #2. It's so poofy, that even though it has a fancy glow in the dark zipper pull, when you try to zip it up, especially at night in the dark, it catches on extra material at least 3 or 4 times. #3. The hood at the top is never where my head is! Every time I turn over or change position I have to hunt for that hood and pull it around to put my head in. I've given it some stern lectures, to no avail. And #4. The sleeping bag is silky. The sleeping mat is silky. My coat and sleeping pants are silky. All that adds up to slipping and sliding all over the place! It's like peas on a knife...I just can't stay put! Tonight it is especially challenging. I'm in the bag, but right now the zipper is coming right up my middle. Oh well, I'm going to have to make it work. The more I struggle with it the more I'm sliding around the tent. On the positive side, it does keep me warm, so I guess I'll keep it for now. It's still cold at night. And at Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap they were selling sleeping bags for $500. I don't think so. I saw an M and M on the ground today. The story goes that a day hiker saw an M and M on the ground and looked at it and walked on by. A section hiker saw an M and M and picked it up, brushed it off, shrugged his shoulders and ate it. A thru-hiker saw an M and M on the ground, grabbed it up, popped it in his mouth and then looked around for more!","Wayah Bald Campsite

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530281,"It was a nice hike this morning. Everybody was talking ""downhill all the way."" We were heading to the Nantahala Outdoor Center and it was about 6 miles away from the shelter.It wasn't an easy cruisin' downhill. There were some, ""Hey, Babe, how ya gonna get down these rocks?"" thrown in. I did have to slide down one on my bottom. But there was a cool breeze, beautiful scenery, and it was an interesting hike.I stopped and rested on a log and dropped a small piece of cracker on the ground. Then I watched an ant work his hardest at moving that cracker. It was just too big for him, but he did not give up. He'd work, then rest, then work, then rest. And finally it moved! I was rooting for him! It reminded me of myself, working my way through this hike. That little ant inspired me. Tonight I am in a female bunkhouse with 4 bunks in my room.

These are mountains, right? What did I expect?I left the NOC about 2:30 yesterday afternoon and I'm glad I did. I never could have done that climb out of there in one day. So I hiked until about 7 and found a spot to camp and that's what I did. I put up my tent just off the trail but it was almost dark so I didn't expect anyone else to come along. It went OK but it took me a while to fall asleep. Just as I was dozing off, I heard clomp, clomp, clomp. Half asleep, I thought, ""Bear!!"" I yelled, ""HEY!!""And a man's voice came back, ""WHAT!!""He was night hiking! Crazy! On those rocky hills? I think we both scared each other. Today was more of the steep climbing, some on loose rocks. I got to the shelter at 12:30. It is raining on my tent right now. The shelter is full of hikers who do not care about the mice. The mice are out of control! Do not sleep with your mouth open! Or, for me, I'll stick with my tent. I met some ladies who said they are hiking 5 miles in each state all the way to Maine. Why didn't I think of that?? They will do 5 miles x 14 states. That's 70 miles...as they are all 70 years old.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530929,"This is a post I wrote in Franklin that never made the journal. I think it shows the variety of people I met along the way. Bastian is the one on the far right in the picture.Warning! This post contains bad language.I was sitting in the car in Franklin with Bastian, a young man from Berlin, Germany. We were waiting at the PO for a couple people sending packages home. I don't know what I was talking about, but I said, ""What in the world!"" Bastian said, ""Huh?"" I repeated myself, ""What in the world!""Bastian gave me a puzzled look. ""What is that?"" ""Oh,"" I told him, ""that is an expression some people use."" I said it means something like 'isn't that odd?'He said, ""Oh, kind of like, 'what the hell.'""I said, ""Yeah, I guess so.""He then said he is surprised that Americans don't cuss like Europeans do. He said in Germany cussing is just a part of everyday language. Much more common than he was hearing on the trail. He said he was trying to watch his language and not offend people with his words. He said all this in his heavy German accent.I didnt hear a lot of bad language on the trail, but if I did, it was mostly women. You might remember Helen and Eddie, the couple I hiked with a couple of days. Helen had a loud voice and she was funny about it. She would struggle up a big ascent, and then would yell off the mountain, ""I did it!"" If there was a big step up, there'd be a loud,""Humpf!"" And some choice words thrown in. The last night we tented together at a shelter, their tent was a little ways from mine, blocked by a grove of trees. All of a sudden, I'd hear a loud ""Humpf!"" and I'd think, she's sitting down on a log. ""Aaargh!"" She's getting up. Then I heard a loud, ""Oh, sh__! I thought, ""That's my Helen! She's crawling into her tent."" I had to chuckle to myself a little. I hope you are laughing, Helen, if you are reading this.Ok...I am getting a ride this morning to Fontana Dam, another famous stopping place on the AT. It is the stepping point into the Smoky Mountains. I'm glad I get to see it, and I'm glad I won't be making that long climb into the Smokies on a foggy, rainy day. So far, no regrets.I've got 2 or 3 more posts to share, and a couple of quotes, like this:*Quote: ""Here is what it is like to hike: I walk with my head down, looking at my feet and the ground just ahead of them. You have to; the path is seldom (never) smooth. It is full of rocks, and roots, and mud puddles. So my head stays down except for the brief look at the trail just ahead of me every few minutes to see what new surprises are waiting. It takes constant focus on my footing. There could be a family of bears sitting right beside the trail having a picnic, and I wouldn't see them. When I want to take a look around at the beauty surrounding me, I have to find a place with fairly level, stable ground, stop walking completely, plant both trekking poles firmly in the ground, and then raise my head. I do this very often, though. I look around and catch my breath and thank God for all this…for the beauty, and the freedom, and for the opportunity to appreciate them. Then I put my head back down and continue walking.""","Stecoah Gap

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531169,"This is June from Florida. I first met her at the outfitter store at the NOC. She was going through her pack and I was helping her with a shakedown...what to keep and what to leave behind. She had a heavy axe, multiple pieces of rain gear, and all the parts of a water filter except the actual filter!Her plan was to drive to Clingman's Dome in the Smokies and hike south for 200 miles. I didn't want to discourage her but I wondered at her chance of success. I ran into her again at the Fontana Dam Lodge. What a story she told! She arrived at the Dome, attempted to get on the trail, but somehow headed down a dirt road instead. Finally, she saw a sign to the AT, about 20 feet away. She stopped and leaned back a bit to take in the sight, and her pack pulled her backwards and down she went, right on her back. She was unhurt, but stuck! She could not get up! Soon 4 big guys came by and picked her up. She felt wobbly so one of them carried her pack for her and they walked her back to her car. She had hiked .6 miles of the AT and she was done.She had her rental car and she had been exploring the area around the Dam for a few days. This morning I was thinking June and I could have driven her car to Virginia and gotten back on the trail together there. Oh well, I won't look back. Well, I'm sure I will, but for now I made the right decision. Today we are still driving home, after an overnight in KY. It has been a much more pleasant ride than last year when it was Dave who quit. Oooh, I was mad that time. This time I just feel like I made the decision I felt was right at the time.

I don't like the word quitting. I keep reminding myself that I just made the decision that seemed best for me at the time.

No, I actually was able to get pretty good sleep...no Diet Coke, you know.Was it...looking bad? No. After day one I didn't really care anymore how I looked.Was it...staying clean?

We have a couple of weeks of hiking planned, starting with the Grayson Highlands area and then heading north to the Shenandoah park. This trip does not feel like the hike I did in April, where I was concentrated on putting away as many miles as I could and and still survive. Remember? I found out my daily mileage was nothing to brag about. I struggled with the breathing and I ended up going home after 150 miles. I've made some changes in medications and lightened my pack weight. This trip feels more like a vacation...no pressure, just relax and take our time.

He was a good writer and it was interesting. And then BAM! He stops writing! He took me all the way from Springer to the White Mountains...and then he was GONE. Now that's one of my pet peeves. I looked him up on FB and there was a picture of him on Katahdin, so I know he made it. But he didn't bother to write that one last post. Bummer.So then what?

Why was I back? Was I going to get right back into the same struggle I had before? Why can't I just stay home and forget all my crazy ideas?

And yes, I struggled, but all of us were tired and ready for the day's hike to be done by the time we reached the campsite.And right then I put my foot down. Those who can go faster, must go faster!

Oh the woes of hiking..and we do it voluntarily!We left the Thomas Knob Shelter area and headed out for a 5.7 mile hike. The hiking this day was more technical with large rock scrambles that took some thinking and careful climbing to maneuver.  We arrived at Wise Shelter in plenty of time to set up camp and cook our meals. Robyn brought her dog along and he was in doggie heaven eating our leftovers. We were in hiker heaven not having to carry out our leftover food. It was a win-win! We hiked through some new and different terrain with open fields surrounded by mountains. We walked through a cow pasture which was a little scary but the cows ignored us. And we saw the famous ponies. And yes, Nancy let them lick her. Not for me! By the end of the day I had one blister on each foot. My left hip was sore and my heel hurt. But I just plugged along at my own pace and it was a good day. And no more leg cramps, thankfully.There was one young man at the shelter. He came looking around for a place to tent and we told him he could set up near us, but we never saw him again. I guess 5 older women didn't look inviting to him. He'd rather sleep in the shelter with the mice!Its amazing how much you can sweat all day while hiking, and then freeze when the sun goes down and you crawl into your tent.

I met two college age boys who were resting and worn out after their 24 mile hike the day before. I unloaded some granola bars and nuts on them which they grabbed up and I was happy to lighten my load.

And she's quite capable! She has a good hikers body and good stamina. She is a physician and she really watched me and had some thoughts on my breathing difficulties. She insisted it wasn't just that I'm too fat and out of shape, but I'm not sure she wasn't just being nice. So, including me...that's the crew. We worked well together. All for one and one for all. It's a good way to hike. We camped at Old Orchard Shelter, where I sat in a big patch of poison ivy. More on that tomorrow!Quote: When you hike the AT this year and pass through 14 states, notice the lack of border guards, the lack of documentation required to pass from state to state, the freedom to come and go as you wish. Without the sacrifice of many, things could be much different than what they are today. We are all very lucky to live in the USA.","Wise Shelter

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543543,"Hike day 4: Well, we had a change of plans. Nancy's daughter and a friend were bringing a shuttle out to Fox Creek parking area. That was 1.4 miles from our camp site. The heat was rising, and there was a quick unanimous decision to get up early, hike the 1.4 miles, and get on that shuttle back to town! We were dirty and stinky and satisfied with our hike. Nancy's plan was to go on for a couple more days with her new crew and the rest of us went back to Damascus. So the shuttle made a bee line for town...WAIT!! No. The shuttle took us on a 40 minute ride down a curvy, hilly, mountain road. The A/C was blasting cold. I was near the back of the big van. And by the time we were back in town, I was all done. I was feeling car sick. Ugh! But hungry too. So we went to MoJo's and got a burger. But they had so much pepper in the meat that it ruined the hamburger for me. Bummer! And we were sitting out in the hot sun. Now I was also overheated. So...Pam went on the popular Virginia Creeper bike ride and I went back to Hiker's Inn where we had an airstream camper rented for the night.Ok. Imagine this. I've been 3 nights, 4 days in the woods. Sweaty. Stinky. Dirty. The camper is clean and has nice twin beds...and a camper shower. Of course... a camper shower. I got the worst of the funk off but it wasn't much of a relaxing shower, what with trying to wash my hair with one hand while holding the wand with the other. But I got it done and felt much better after a good nap. I know I've been complaining a lot but now it gets good. Really good. We went to Pizza Plus for dinner. It was sooo delicious! Fresh salad and good pizza at a great price. It was wonderful. And then more magic happened. On the drive back to our silver bullet camper, we saw a sign on a little church. It was hymn sing night! It started at 7 and it was 7:05. So we parked the car and went in. They welcomed us...and rightly so. There were 13 of us in the audience and 4 singers in the guest singing group. Oh it was fun! Very southern twangy hymn singing. With every song, the two ladies near the front would look at each other and nod their heads in approval. And if you're my age and older you might remember the funeral home fans we had in church to stay cool. Yes! No air conditioning, but we had those square fans with the wooden handles. It was just a delightful evening. Note: Oh, yes. I was going to tell you about the poison ivy story. There was a rock in the area where we were camping that was a nice sitting spot for eating. It was surrounded by and a little overgrown with green plants. Very pretty and inviting. So I pointed it out to Nancy and she ate her dinner sitting on the rock. The next morning I sat on the rock to eat my breakfast. Another hiker, a middle aged man, was there cooking for himself and he said to me, ""You are aware you are sitting in the middle of poison ivy, aren't you?"" I answered, ""No!"" He said, ""Well you ladies all looked experienced so I figured you would know."" Oh, dear. Sorry, Nancy.Quote: ""Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as though you had chosen it.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543630,"So where are we? And what happened to our hike?Well, phase 1 was over and the next step was to go to the Shenandoah park. But the temperatures were going to be up to 100, there were storms in the forecast, and we heard that tenting was difficult in the park. Apparently the few tent sites are on very slanted ground and that leaves the mouse infested shelters or sleeping in hammocks. So Pam and I discussed our options and chose...Charleston, SC. We arrived Sunday evening and got a hotel right downtown in the middle of the action. Monday was a full day. We took a walking tour first. This is a very popular thing to do, and there were little groups everywhere being led by a guide. I had to chuckle at the poor lady who must have been new on the job. She was walking fast, ahead of her group, papers in her hand, and I could see her mouthing the words as she walked. Practicing. Her group was scurrying along trying to keep up with her. But it had to be about 100 degrees outside, so hurrying was not preferred. I was glad I was not in her group.When we were done with that I was again hot and my feet were killing me. Here's the thing with my feet. There are painful blisters on each foot, the right foot has 3 toes that are bruised at the nail and those nails are sure to fall off. And my left heel has that tendonitis that causes me to limp along like a poor old thing. Poor Pam had to put up with that all day.So I was very unsure about going on the sailing cruise. I did not want to get seasick and there was a lot of walking down to the water. But we stopped and ate and cooled off, and it turned out that the sailing was the highlight of the day.But we weren't done yet! There was shopping to do! The city market was about to close so we hurried through the stalls to see what they had. The usual.Our last stop was for dinner at Hyman's. It was a seafood extravaganza. Our table had little plaques that said Barbara Streisand sat at this table. So did Jimmy Buffet and Judge Wapner. We finally got back to our hotel, where I got cleaned up and collapsed into bed. Sightseeing is every bit as hard as hiking when it's this hot out!Quote: ""My feet are not hurting, they're just saying, 'Hello! I love you!' with every step.""Yeah, right!Note: In case you're wondering what my husband thinks of all this...when I called him he said to have a great girl's trip. He even asked if I had clothes!

It was quite  a drive up to the Springer Mt parking lot, and not without some angst if we were on the right road. Dave dropped us off and he took off for home. We had barely stepped out of the car when a man started in on us...everything he thought we were doing wrong. It was right out of the Walk in the Woods book and movie. We sweetly said thank you for your advice and we headed up the 1 mile trail to the summit and southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. We took a few pictures and headed back down to the parking lot. (I know it's confusing but that's how it's done.) And there was our friendly ""criticizer"" with a cooler of trail magic. I took a juice in a plastic container. Then he says, ""I can't take all your garbage. I guess I can take some of it but not all of it. Well if he had said that earlier I would not have taken a juice that I would have to carry out the container. I could tell him a thing or two about being a trail angel! He was doing it wrong! I finished the drink and snuck that plastic jug in his plastic sack. MINE was going to be part of the ""some"" garbage!I was able to be a trail angel myself today. There was a girl on the trail very sick. She was sitting there beside the trail and told me she had been throwing up and having the runs all day. I thought, ""Lord, have mercy! What a nightmare!""

I was pretty sure it was a mouse, but it was confirmed when Jayne found an acorn in her boot this morning. The mice were happy last night. And today? Jayne and I started out about 8 AM. She moved ahead of me, heading to Gooch Gap. I struggled with lots of uphill, very little water, and sore feet. I was taking a rest, really feeling done in, when I met Journey, also looking done in. We ended up hiking the same pace and stuck together. That pace was take 25 steps and stop. Repeat for what seemed like hours. We were both very thirsty and very tired.

One young man jumped up, grabbed his rope, and said, ""Let's go look!""Perfect. This was starting out well. We walked around a little and I pointed out a good branch. He thought it would not be strong enough to hold all the weight, but I convinced him it was fine. So I tied my rope to a nice sized rock. He tied his rope to a stick. And he started throwing his rope. He tried about 5 times and could not get his rope placed. I said, ""Here, try mine! My rock is heavier and may clear the branch easier."" He threw my rope and it went perfectly. Great! Now I had my rope hung! I attached my bag and I pulled it up. I'm really pretty skilled at getting strong guys to hang my bag!So I got in my tent early and tossed and turned a little until I fell asleep. And then I heard it. Coming through the sticks behind my tent. I hollered, ""Go away, bear!"" Then I could see the outline of the bear right beside my tent. I kept yelling, ""Go away! Go away, bear!"" And I wanted to kick the side of the tent a little but my legs were deep in my sleeping bag. I thought surely the neighboring tenters would hear me. But the bear wasn't being aggressive and wasn't growling or making any noise. Just mosying on through. And I let it go. So then later I woke up. Was all that true? Or just a dream? I've been thinking and thinking about it and I honestly don't know. It seemed very real, I can still remember that bear outline clearly, but was I dreaming it all? I surely wouldnt have just quietly gone back to sleep, would I? I will have to ask the other hikers in the morning if they could hear me yelling. (It's midnight now.)I dreamed the other night that my son Casey decided to build on to the back of their home, which they built new a few years ago. When I went to see it the entire house was being redone. The beautiful kitchen was demolished, 4 new bedrooms were going in on the 3rd story. I was shocked! Now that was a dream. Maybe the bear was too. I think maybe it was. Maybe. Today we hiked a long, difficult downhill, scrambling through more boulder fields. It's hard on the legs and the knees, and could be very easy to fall. Thankfully I have not yet fallen on this trip. We got to Unicoi Gap, paid a guy sitting there in his car to give us a ride to town, where we got 2 rooms in a cheap hotel and got cleaned up, reorganized, and got our laundry done. It feels good. We are in the little town of Helen, GA, which is built as a mock Bavarian town. Very touristy place. We needed two rooms because my husband Dave is on his way right now bringing my 13 year old grandson to hike with me a couple of days. We are still in challenging country and I hope it goes well. He's sure to see Grandma trudging up some very steep mountains. And it isn't pretty!Quote:""I have taken back the position I had at the start of this trip - that you could use the trail as your training ground - HA!!""","Rocky Nob

I tossed and turned, worried about the big climb out of Unicoi Gap. There were a couple of climbs for the day that looked challenging. They were for me, but Ben could have run up and down the mountains a few times while he waited for me. But he didn't. He just tooled along, stopping when I stopped and never once complained about the pace. When I asked him about it he said he likes to go slow. He likes to hear the crunch of his shoes on the trail, and he pointed out trees and bugs that I normally don't see because I have my head down and my eyes on the trail. We pulled off at a nice campsite just before another big climb. It was early but Ben's shoulders were hurting so we had a good excuse! Ben helped set up the tent, built a fire, constructed a bench for us to sit on, went and checked out the water source, and then we tried to make supper.Supper was a fail. My fuel ran out and our hot food was not hot. Bummer!I met Winkle on the trail today. She and I have emailed a couple times through Trailjournals, so it was fun to randomly run into her. She section hiked the entire trail and it took her 10 years. She lives nearby and was out for a day hike. Let me tell you, I would not be choosing to hike out of Unicoi Gap for a lark.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560325,"I'm still shocked when I see my white hair in a mirror. I came out to the trail in 2016, intending to let my hair go natural. It took all last year, but this finally is my natural color, for all the folks at home who have wondered. Anyway, Ben and I put in a huge day yesterday. We ended up hiking 9.4 miles, tackling a very big uphill at the end of the day. Kelly Knob was a steep climb, followed by a .3 mile off-trail path to the Deep Gap Shelter. We were glad we did it because it made today shorter, and we were tired today. Ben had a great second day on the trail. He collected mountain water, he met some cool people, he got a trail name (LOC, pronounced El O Cee), which stands for Lewis or Clark, he got growled at by an unleashed dog, and he found a treasure on the trail. Lying on a log was a small wooden cross which had the AT logo woodburned into it. It was especially exciting because he himself is a woodburner. It was a good Easter momento from the trail. We cooked supper late, hung our bags, and headed into the tent. We heard this morning that mice controlled the shelter all night long. We were snug and happy to be in our tent. This morning we were tired and we had a few miles to hike to where Dave was picking Ben up to head home. For 2 days Ben had talked nonstop, saying he had 2000 stories to tell me. It was so fun to listen to him. But he must have run out of stories, because today he was pretty quiet. And hungry. I told him Grandpa would take him for a McDonald's. So as he hiked behind me, I'd hear, ""Mmmm, a McDonald's hamburger!"" Then, ""Wow, I could eat 2 hamburgers!"" Ben was ready to get back to civilisation.  But he's convinced that he and his best buddy are heading out after college and hiking the whole trail...Georgia to Maine! Be ready, Brock!Dave picked us up and dropped me off at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA. He only asked me once if I wanted to go home with them but he knew the answer would be no, and he was ok with that. He's a good supporter. I showered and crawled in bed and plan to stay here for a zero tomorrow...no miles hiked. I'll resupply and rest my feet and legs. Journey is out hiking now and we will try to meet up in 2 days, ready to head out for the next leg of the trip.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560516,"0.0 miles. That's not exactly true. Yes, no miles on the trail, but miles of walking around these mountain towns should count for something. More hills!I got in bed yesterday mid afternoon and stayed there till morning. And I slept good enough that when I started to wake up in the morning and I moved my legs, I thought, ""What?? What's wrong with my legs?"" And then, ""Oh, yeah, I'm hiking."" If it doesn't hurt here, it hurts there, and if it doesn't hurt there, it hurts somewhere else. But yes, I know, it's my choice, so no complaining!I spent the morning going through my pack, walking to Rite Aid to get a few things, walking to an outfitter store to see what they had, walking back to the outfitter store to return what I bought, and walking back to Rite Aid, same thing.I waited for the noon bus to show up but Journey wasn't on it so I headed down the street to a BBQ place for lunch. Those were some of the best ribs I have ever had. Might have been because I hadn't eaten in 24 hours, but I sure enjoyed them. I walked back to the motel and did all my laundry, which means I sat around in my rain clothes for a couple of hours. Journey arrived mid afternoon. Around 6 we walked a half mile down to Daniel's Steakhouse and had another great meal and then to Ingles grocery to buy food for our next 5 - 6 day trek. Funny for the day: Journey was done shopping and waiting on a bench out front of the grocery store. When I joined her she said she had been watching a vehicle sitting there for a long time. It was two older ladies who must be waiting on someone to come out. About that time another lady arrived and started talking to the two in the SUV. They were laughing and having a great time, so Journey said, ""I'm going to go ask them if they will give us a ride back to the motel when they are ready to go."" I thought, ""Well, ok, I guess you can try that."" Journey approached them and asked for our ride. They said, ""Why sure! We're just up here people watching! All our husbands are dead and we come sit up here in the parking lot in tbe evening to see what's going on!""We climbed in the back seat with all our packages and had a hootin' time with sisters Faye and Joanne.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561219,"I didn't sleep very well last night because I was a bit worked up over the trailjournal site and the fact that my accounts were messed up and my miles were incorrect. If you know me well, you know I am a detail person and I like things to be right. I emailed the webmaster and he assured me we would get it straightened out after the new format comes out in about 2 weeks. So get ready, all of you who write on or read Trailjournals. It's about to undergo a big change. Hope it's user friendly!About 30 minutes into our hike from Dicks Creek it began to rain. A pack cover and a poncho did the trick and we continued on, hiking to Plumorchard Gap Shelter. The shelter was a 3-decker and there were many of us hoping to sleep inside because more rain was expected. I chose the bottom deck...no climbing up ladders for me. However, the second story was not high enough to fully stand up under and it was only minutes until I cracked my head hard on that solid wood platform. Everybody jumped to attention. They said the whole shelter shook.  Amazingly, it didn't hurt that much, but my teeth were definitely jarred and I was glad to find they were still all in place. I had no bump or cut, so all was well. Journey chose the top layer, hoping there might be fewer mice up there. She got all her stuff up there, then came down to cook her supper. She found out she was missing something so up that horrible ladder she had to go again. Seriously, it was completely vertical and the rungs were far apart. She said, ""I'm going up to get my spoon. I'll be down in 2 seconds."" I said loudly, ""Journey! Do not be down in 2 seconds!"" It brought a good laugh to the group.There were a couple of younger people there, but for the most part Journey and I are in a bubble of an older crowd. The Gipper is hiking with Dynamite. She is 71 years old and about 90 pounds...and faithfully practices her yoga. She flies up these mountains with no problem. Amazing. She and The Gipper met on the trail, hike together, cook together, but sleep on the  very opposite ends of the shelter. He was one of the few males in the shelter. Lucky Star is a single gal from Texas and is a free spirit. She sleeps late, takes long lunches, and still beats Journey and me at the end of the day. I really like her a lot. And there's Pam. She's in her 50s and hiking alone. She spent a couple of days off the trail getting a younger female hiker to a hospital for gall bladder surgery and she rescued a young male hiker who had been turned away from a hostel because he was sick. She somehow got him to a hotel. She now says PAM stands for Provider for All Mankind. There's all kinds of good folks out here.  The conversation usually goes, ""What's your name?  Where are you from? How far are you going? Well, be careful! See ya down the trail!""Journey and I look at each other and laugh as we wave goodbye to their backs. The young people out here can hike hard and hike fast.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561222,"No mice. Yeah!However, there was one gal who said last night that she was going to be up early and put in big miles today. Well, I know this...she was up early! At 5:30 her alarm went off and her day started with packing things up, very loudly. Up and down the scary ladder, rustling her things.That went on until everyone else was awake and getting up. By the time Journey and I had our packs on and were heading out at 7:30, she was just deciding to sit down and make a cup of coffee yet before she left. I think she was one of the last to pass us that morning, but I haven't seen her since, so I guess she probably did get her big miles in. As it turned out it was a very long day for me. Pam and Journey had moved out ahead of me. My knees were hurting and I was poking along.  After I passed the GA/NC sign, I stopped to fill up my water bottles out of the stream and I ate my lunch and laid down for a few minutes on my blue tarp (one of my favorite things in my pack, always handy for a quick rest).When I got moving again...oh my. It was a very difficult climb. Very steep and very long and very hard. I came to one spot where two boulders joined and I absolutely could not step high enough to get up it. I threw my poles ahead and climbed up on my knees and somehow hoisted myself and my big pack up those rocks. But once I was up, I was still down! I could not stand up! I had to humbly crawl to the nearest tree and pull myself up that way. Then I had to go back and carefully bend over and pick my poles up off the ground, which is never easy with the pack on. It would have made a good video I'm sure. When I finally hobbled into the shelter I got a big cheer from everybody. Rather than be embarrassed, I said, ""I want that big of a cheer when I finally get to Katahdin!"" They all laughed and cheered some more.They had a place for me to sleep in the shelter, so I had a quick bite to eat and crawled in my sleeping bag, ready for another night of tossing and turning, side, back, side, back. And always trying to keep my head covered in case of mice. Shelters are not my favorite. Those last few difficult miles, I hiked alone and turned on my music for some encouragement. One of the songs that came up was just what I needed:He lovingly guides every footstep,He tenderly cares for me.His strong arms of love are about me,My Savior and Shepherd is He.

Last year when I was in this area there were forest fires burning but I was just ahead of them. It's awful. We've been in it two days so far. Very sad.Our last 2 miles were downhill and seemed to take forever. Journey's knees are a concern and give her lot of pain. Down hills are the worst on the knees. We made it to Beech Gap and we were glad to see some of the rest of our group were there also. We were worn out. I ate a cold supper and got my tent up, hung my food bag, and crawled in.

But lots and lots of heavy rain. My tent did great.  I was dry inside (and I WAS praying that no heavy limb would come crashing down on me.)When I bought food in Hiawassee I picked up a box of Kind bars...Popped, Salted Caramel. Sounded good. Well, I took a bite of one the first morning and it was NOT good. There was no hint of anything salted caramel in there, in my opinion. So I looked at the ingredients: oats, sorghum, millet, amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat...that's food for HORSES! So every morning I've been asking, ""Anyone want a Kind bar? It's Popped Salted Caramel!"" And every morning I have a new victim. No repeaters. Ha!Journey and I stuck together again today. It was a lovely hike with decent terrain, although again we were in burned out woods. You can still smell the fire smell. In the early afternoon we were passed by a group of 5 young boys with their dads. They looked about 10 years old. They were on a backpacking trip for a couple of nights. Looked like 4 of the 5 were having fun. Shortly after they passed us we came up on them at a stream and they were getting water. All of a sudden it started to rain. Everyone, including us, scrambled to get our pack covers and rain gear on. Pretty soon it was pouring down rain. We hiked fast and the rain kept coming until we were splashing in puddles of water and the mud and gushy leaves were coming up over our boots. Soon our socks and feet were soaked. At first it actually felt so good because our feet had been burning up hot from the hiking. And then the sun came out, the rain stopped, and we slogged through slimy mud for the rest of the afternoon. We stopped around 4:30 and we are camped at the same campsites as the young boys. It's 8:45 and their dads already have them quieted down. We boiled up our dehydrated suppers (the sweet and sour pork was delicious,  the au gratin potatoes were a flop) and I went to look for a limb to hang our food bags. A couple of men were also looking and said the problem here was the squirrels! The one guy said a squirrel already destroyed his backpack right in front of him. Well, I hung the bags...too low for a good bear hang and probably just right for squirrels. If our bags are down in the morning and our food is gone, we won't worry because we plan to be in Franklin tomorrow evening.

It wasn't hiking. It was rock climbing. Several times I had to pull myself up by pulling on trees or rocks. It was scary and exhausting. I tried very hard to make sure my foot was planted in a safe spot each time before I pushed off, but in some spots it was a bit iffy. I'm glad that experience is behind me. On top of Albert we crossed the 100 mile marker. And then we had 6.5 miles more to hike. It was thankfully mostly downhill, good for me, but very difficult for Journey as her knee was giving her a lot of pain.

It surely wasn't for lack of courage or determination. Journey is a phenomenally strong woman to accomplish what she did, but this morning her injuries did not allow her to continue her hike. I stayed with her coming down the mountain. We had been following two young gals who were being picked up at the Winding Stairs parking lot. It appeared their little car was full, with 2 older ladies in the front seats and the two younger in the back. The trunk was full of their gear. But when the ladies saw Journey and her condition, they were mercy angels and found a way to get Journey and her pack into that car. So with a few tears and a hug, Journey was on her way back to town. And then...I was alone. It felt a little strange. You should have seen me piddle around, doing anything to delay walking off by myself. I had miles to go to the shelter, all uphill, so I finally got up and got moving. It was slow and long. It reminded me of the little Swiss mountain climber on The Price is Right. How old is that show? He must be a little old man by now. He slowly moves up that mountain, stopping along the way when he hits the right price. I also moved along slowly, stopping sometimes to stretch my legs or rest. I hiked until 7 pm, and had reached the shelter blue blaze path. But the shelter was .3 miles away down a steep trail and I was physically done hiking for the day.

Decade arrived yesterday at the Wayah Tower around 6:00. I had been waiting there for her, and we then continued on to the Wayah Shelter. Out tents were side by side on a small tent site. The paths around the shelter were hilly and steep. Not easy to get around!One of the hardest things of the day is to crawl into the tent in the evening. I try to go in on my knees, but those last 6 inches before the knees hit the tent floor are real groaners. Once I got settled in last night my legs started to feel crampy and very painful. I felt sorry for Decade as I tossed and turned all night. I wondered how I could possibly hike another day!And then we got up to rain. Not a quick spring shower. It was a cold wet day, but we hit the trail in our rain gear and made the best of it. Decade hiked about 8 miles and then caught her ride to her car to return home. I continued another couple of miles and had a record day for this year. Now I'm at the shelter, in my tent, and my legs are aching. The weather has cleared and hopefully the rain is over.

I sat down on the log at the entrance and dropped my bag right behind me. It was covered with a very wet pack cover and I just let it fall back onto the platform. There were several people inside behind me. Suddenly I saw a man all huddled up against the wall, all dressed in black, not saying a word. I got the feeling he was not pleased with all the people stopping in. When I got ready to leave I picked up my pack and of course the floor had gotten a little wet.

There was another girl there making herself a cup of coffee. Her name is Ariana. Later she passed me up, and I saw her again at the next shelter. She was very enthusiastic and friendly. This morning when I was a little more than a mile into my hike, I met her coming towards me. I said, ""What are you doing going the wrong way?""She had climbed that mile-plus to go to the ""Jump Off"" point to see the sunrise! Then she was hiking back to the shelter to get ready for the day. Several hours later she passed me, flying down the trail. Now there's a hiker who is enjoying every moment and the trail is apparently not one bit difficult for her. Don't I wish!One more: I met a young man coming toward me this morning. I noticed right away he had only one arm. We spoke a bit and then exchanged names. His trail name is ""Blessed."" Another man came down the trail and joined our conversation. He asked Blessed how his day was going. He answered, ""It's the best day of my life!"" What an inspiration! There were two especially challenging spots today to get down. I stood at the top and just really was stumped, both times. I ended up taking off my pack and set it down as low as I safely could, then scooted down on my bottom, and reached back and pulled my pack down to me. I made it. Phew!At about one mile to go, I saw a man coming toward me. It was Cousin Chuck! He had driven up from Atlanta and had hiked up to greet me. What a joy! He is one of the most delightful persons I know. We hiked the mile down together, he carrying my heavy pack and me carrying his light day pack. We spent the afternoon enjoying the beautiful NOC (you can call it the N-O-C, or ""the knock""). It's a very cool place, and like last year, I would encourage any families who like adventure to check it out. Things to do for all ages.Chuck and I had lunch together and scouted around a little, and then he headed back to Atlanta. Thank you, Chuck, for a wonderful afternoon!I was tempted to want to stay another day, but I found out no bunks are available tomorrow night, so I hustled around and got my laundry done, my Smoky Mountain Permit bought and printed, and collected Journey's drop box. There was enough there that I didn't have to buy much at all for the next few day's supplies.Did you cstch that? I got my Smokies permit. Last year I did not do that. Last year it was at this point that I was just beginning to flounder. I could see the huge climbs I have in the next couple of days, and I was having my doubts. And two days later, I left the trail. So my plan is to not let that happen this year. I will try to leave here early in the morning and I will somehow climb out of this deep gorge, no matter how long it takes. My next goal is Fontana Dam. So all you pray-ers out there, pray that I have physical strength and mental resolve the next few days!","Wesser Bald Shelter

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562341,"Yesterday was the longest entry, and today will be the shortest. I made it to Swim Bald. It was 6:00 PM and starting to sprinkle. I had 1.6 miles to the shelter. I remember that last year my tent was on a slant by that shelter because the good tent sites there were few. I figured I would not get a good spot so late. 
So I made the decision to stop and put up my tent at a nice little camp site and I will go the extra mile tomorrow.
I remember now why I started thinking of quitting on this climb last year. I cannot tell you how many times I said, ""Oh God,"" today, but I can tell you none of them were in vain. It was a grueling climb. 
Someone said to me today, ""Remember,  75% of the hikers have already left the trail.""  I'm not ready to give up yet!","Nantahala Outdoor Center
",Swim Bald,"Apr 29, Sat",5.80
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562524,"I made the right decision last night. I had a good night in my tent on a nice flat spot. 
I was so leg weary by 6:00, I was absolutely ready to stop. Everyone passing me at that point was encouraging me and urging me on to the shelter. ""You got this!"" ""You're doing great!"" ""Only 1.6 left to go! You can do it!""
Well, I didn't want to! I was ready to stop and that was ok with me. 
After I was all settled in my tent, i heard a man walk by on the trail. He was huffing and puffing, and he muttered, ""Well, this is a nice spot!"" He hesitated, and there were a couple places he could have put his tent, but no...he trudged on to the land of disappointment, I'm sure. Poor guy. This morning when I did get to the shelter, there were people tenting all over in terrible spots. I have to make my own decisions. And I made a good one last night. 
One thing my co-hikers are right about is that I need to eat more. I'm having a terrible time getting food down. I pack my little front pack with food to eat during the day, but when I stop to eat...yuck...I just can't get much down. Fruit snacks. That's the best. But that's not protein or calories to keep me going. You'd think I'd be losing weight, but it doesn't appear that I am. How is that possible??
So...I made it to the 150.8 mile mark...the very spot where I quit last year. I don't know whose idea it was to redo those 150 miles! Oh yeah, that was my idea. Well, I'll tell you what...I'm never doing them again!
I came down those steps at Stecoah Gap and called the Wolf Creek Hostel. I am in a trailer tonight. Got my wash done, showered, and am charging my chargers and phone. The owner here told me his wife would make me a hamburger. Good! I thought I could eat that! My favorite food!  Soon he came back with 2 hamburgers and 2 hot dogs and green beans with ham. Crazy! I got one burger down. The rest is in the fridge,  in case I'm here tomorrow, I can try to eat more! 
What's up for tomorrow? They say rain. And more rain the end of the week. I better get used to it. But since I'm making my own decisions, I might decide to rest my legs tomorrow and head out Tuesday. Don't know yet.
This is a great place in most respects, but the only place to sit is a hard kitchen chair or a HUGE beanbag in the living room. Oh my! Getting out of this beanbag is worse than getting out of my tent! I try to not get out of it when the guy is here. How embarrassing! Picture it! I have to roll out of it to my knees, push myself off the floor and moan and groan and make quite a scene. 
For that reason, I'm heading back to the bed. Big king size bed! Bathroom right next door.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562668,"I made another good decision. I stayed at the Wolf Creek Hostel all day, while the rain poured and the wind howled. The electricity went out early in the day, but not to worry! I was happy napping and catching up with working on my journal pictures, and simply resting. 
Around 3 this afternoon my trailer mate for tonight arrived. I had met her once before out on the trail so we were already familiar with one another. And she's great! But oh dear! She was soaked through and so was every bit of her gear. And we have no electricity...so no washer and dryer, no shower. She said it had poured all day and the winds on the trail were 60 mph. She was hugging trees to stay upright. 
They brought us KFC tonight. Such wonderful hosts. The charge for the rides to and from the trail, bed, shower, laundry, kitchen, TV, WiFi, is $25 a night. And they fed me 2 huge meals plus any food in the kitchen I wanted, and he gave me a pack of wet wipes. So I'll offer him more for that, but I will be surprised if he will want to take it. 
I feel like a slug, sitting in the beanbag chair while she is still sorting and cleaning and packing her bag. She is exhausted and stiff, and feels like I did last night. But I really can't help her with that. I think I'll go in and help her get her sheets on her bed when she's ready. It's the least I can do! And that's what I've done all day...the least I can do!(The new site is obviously different.

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562907,"We woke up with still no electricity, but we (being Roberta, or Bert , and myself) got up and dressed and ready for the trail. 
We called Lonnie that we were ready and soon he showed up with breakfast sandwiches from Bojangles for us. Lonnie was the most generous and thoughtful host, even if we had no power for a day and night. Probably more so, because with the power out he wanted to be sure we were well taken care of. 
He gave us a ride to Stecoah Gap and Bert and I started up the trail. I was on new ground! And it started off with a .6 mile climb called Jacob's Ladder. Remember that story from the Bible? Jacob saw a stairway to Heaven. Uh-huh. It was short, but it was straight up. 
Bert, of course, was ahead of me on the uphill all day, but we landed at Cable Gap Shelter at mile 158.9. My tent is up, I've eaten, my food bag is hung, and I'm writing my journal. But there is no service here, so this will have to be posted whenever I can get a cell signal. 
The big push now is for Fontana Dam, and then into the Smokies.  There's talk of snow coming in the Smokies. Umm, not sure I'm a candidate for sleeping in the snow.","Stecoah Gap
",Cable Gap Shelter,"May 02, Tue",8.50
Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562931,"I had a big fight in my tent last night. I ended up slightly slanted to the side, and between trying to stay in place and being twisted up in my sleeping bag, I don't think I got much sleep. 
The hiking today was the usual...hike uphill all morning to get out of the gap, and then hike downhill all afternoon to the next shelter. There was one spot this afternoon that was seriously scary. There had been a big blowdown of trees and the trail was completely washed out for about 35 or 40 feet. Bert and I were daunted but not out. She took off first and started picking her way through the tree debris. I followed. It was horrendous. I slipped once but caught myself with both hands. It was a moment of, ""What am I doing out here?"" There is a picture but it doesn't truly show the treacherous risky crossing it was.
We made it eventually to Fontana Dam and I am in a spot in the shelter. It's known as the Fontana Hilton because there are real bathrooms with a shower. But the shelter is a shelter, hard floors, side by side sleeping, and mice. And there is a huge loud beer party going on down by the fire. 
There's lots of talk of the Smokies and bad weather. No one is sure of what to do in the next few days. This is a big resort place so I could stay here in Fontana and wait it out...but if that becomes the plan I will move to the Lodge and a little more pleasant atmosphere. If the forecast looks like the weather will clear, I guess I will move on. 
True Confession: I am a little afraid of the Smokies.","Cable Gap Shelter

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563063,"What a night! The partying lasted for hours, the floor was hard, there was a lot of snoring and restless moving about. When hikers roll around, the mats under them can be quite noisy. And it was hot and stuffy in the shelter. I was deep into my sleeping bag so that I could have plenty enough coverage around my head for mouse protection. That means my legs were quite confined in the bottom of the bag. Now my husband and kids know about my history with claustrophobia. Not so much of small spaces but of not being free to move. So in my sleeping bag, I have to never, never, never, NEVER think about my legs not being free to move. But last night when I thought NEVER think about it, of course I THOUGHT ABOUT IT! And it was a panic moment. I had to get out! Get out now! As I scrambled to free myself I was glad that I at least did not have a loud squeaky mat under me so that everyone knew I was freaking out. Of course the girl next to me had to live through my next crazy move. I must have dozed off and suddenly I thought there was a mouse at my head. I grabbed my blow-up pillow and started slamming the floor with it where I thought the mouse was. Pretty soon I realized I was slamming my pillow on my neighbor's feet.  We were lying head to foot so thankfully I wasn't beating her face! Oh my!In the morning I gathered my things and called the resort shuttle to take me to the Lodge! Please! Well, first thing I heard from the driver was that the entire resort was out of power.  Several power lines were knocked down by fallen trees during the early morning wind.I went ahead and got a room, but when I got in there the bathroom was completely dark, there was not enough water to shower anyway, it was cold, and there was nothing to do. I laid down awhile, then walked to the gas station where there was a generator running and I could get a sandwich. There was a lot of talk that the power may be out for a couple of days. So i walked to the office, cancelled my room, and called Lonnie! Yes! The mobile home had power and I could get a ride from Steve and I should go on in and make myself at home. So that's where I am. Back at the trailer and feeling safe and happy. I got my shower, my clothes cleaned, and Lonnie brought me some popcorn to eat. Mmm, so good!The rain is just starting and it's very possible I will lose power here also, but I plan to stay here until this weather pattern has moved on. That may be a few days.Quote: ""There will be times on the trail you need to use two things, and those are your best judgment and your credit card.""","Fontana Hilton Shelter

Mrs. Knobby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563307,"You know what's harder than hiking? Sitting around all day! I was alone all day in the hostel trailer, thankfully with power, but no water. 
As the day wore on I got more and more rattled and doubtful and I guess just stir crazy and lonely. And there's the phone sitting right there, and a ride home is just a phone call away. It works on your mind.
But I found out Dynamite was looking for a place to stay for tonight so we got it arranged that she would join me, but we would have to move to the second Wolf Creek location as the water was not yet on here by 5 pm. 
If you remember, I met Dynamite way back before Franklin and I knew we would make good housemates. However, 10 minutes before I was being picked up the water came back on and yeah!! I didn't have to move. 
Dynamite arrived and we have caught up on all the trail news and suddenly I am no longer thinking of going home...instead we are planning our trek through the Smokies together. It seems I am provided for at each step along the way. 
Now the question is when is it safe to go. It looks like Sunday will be cold but ok to head out, if the trail has been cleared and we can get through. I'm really not interested in any more of those monkey climbs through the blown down trees. I didn't come out here for that much adventure!
We will stay here tomorrow yet for sure and then see what the news is for continuing on. Stay tuned...

But we are warm and dry and we are making the best of it.In fact we are really getting into hiker mode. We went through all our food and made our grocery list, and then we pondered how we might get to Robbinsville, about 10 miles away. Our plan was to head down to the diner and plead our case to anyone who might be going that way. When we got there, the place was nearly empty, except there was a table of guys who were on their lunch break. One of them said he could take us in an hour but couldn't bring us back. So we had lunch while we waited and said we'd figure out something for a ride back.Step #1 was successful.We got our groceries at Ingles and then asked the clerk if she knew of anyone driving back our way. Soon the manager was asking around, and very quickly a kindly lady with a 13 yr old daughter said she would take us! Step #2 accomplished. The whole project went off perfectly. These hiker towns are used to hikers needing rides around and we really appreciated their kindness. Reports of conditions in the mountains are not good. It is snowing and cold. The roads around the park are closed. Tomorrow might be better weather here, but we've been warned by someone who knows the mountains to not try going up until Monday.

This afternoon Dynamite and I took a walk down some beautiful country roads. We saw butterflies (there's a video under the video section if you can find it),  heard a woodpecker, and found an old chimney that has lost its house.

I was so tired last night. I guess 4 days off did a number on me. Many people passed me who were stopping at the same campground I was going to, including my partner Dynamite. 
When I arrived at the campsite it appeared to be deserted. No people. No tents in sight. It was freaky. I felt like it was a Twilight Zone! I admit I fought some tears off. 
Then I saw Dynamite coming towards me and she led me to her tent, where I basically collapsed. After resting I got my tent up and we had something to eat and I crawled into my tent for the night.

I couldnt eat so I didnt have needed calories for fuel. And i was just tired.But there I was in the Smokies with a couple days left to hike to get to Clingman's Dome where I could get off the trail. And I had decided it was time to go home and let my body rest.But I ran into two older gentlemen who were trail maintainers. We visited and they said they were going to the same shelter as I that night. And they were going home today. And my ears perked up. I asked them how they were getting off the mountain the next day and they told me of another trail that would take me down. But they said it was 5 miles downhill to hike. And they said they were fast hikers! Go like lightning! Leaving early! Obviously they didnt want an old, tired and moaning woman holding them back. So they gave me the directions on finding and following 2 different trails to find my way down to Cades Cove. It sounded easy enough. I knew that Cousin Chuck had offered to meet me around the Gatlinburg area and I texted him and voila! I had a ride from the Cades Cove trailhead to Gatlinburg and my husband was on his way to get me!I got up early and headed out and found the trail. It was a nice downhill and I made good time. And soon...here comes Cousin Chuck hiking toward me! It was a good moment!Oh! And when I left the shelter the two old guys were just waking up and they never did pass me until we got right to the end of the trail. Ha!
