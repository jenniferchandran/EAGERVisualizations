Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564564,"Only 9 days left before I embark on this once in a lifetime adventure.  I have tried to think of everything but I am sure there are things that will pop up along the way.  I am excited and nervous at the same time.  So lucky to have the best support team ever, my wife Kathy, my dog Misty, my cat Smokey, my cat BeBe and all my friends. ",,View Entry,"May 14, Sun",0

Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565964,After a slight delay I have finally arrived in Harper's Ferry WV where I am staying at the Teahorse Hostel which is a very nice hostel and many interesting people. Have pack ready and bounce box will go to post office in the morning. Have registered with AT Conservancy as a flip flop hiker and received number 211. Planning to head out as soon as post office opens. The weather calls for rain and thunderstorms for our first day but not to worry that is what rain gear is for!,,Harper's Ferry WV,"May 24, Wed",0
Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566338,Well day 3 and we are moving along pretty good. We have covered a total of 36 Trail miles  and plan to leave Maryland tomorrow and start Pennsylvania! Have had some rain but temps perfect for hiking.  Lots of woods but had some really open field areas today that were beautiful. Was lucky enough to get Trail magic today. After first small river crossing we ran into a nice woman and her husband cooking hotdogs and hamburgers. What a great treat. Ate one of each and boy was it good. Made camp tonight about 5p and looking forward to resupply at Walmart!  Hope pictures uploaded as still trying to figure out how everything works. Until next time! Love to all!,"Pine Knob Shelter

Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566681,"Well have made it thri day 5! Spent most of the day climbing up and there were lots of rocks to make the day interesting. Finally had some sunshine today after 4 days of cloudy, rainy and wet days. We have covered a little over 60 miles so averaging about 12 per day. Not too shabby to start with. The mountain laurel is in full bloom and beautiful.  We will be in Pennsylvania for a while and hope to get to Boiling Springs Friday for bounce box.  So far have been able to call home each night as cell service has been pretty good. Will upload a few pictures from past few days. Love to all!","Deer Lick Shelter

Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566938,"Wow! Day 7 and all is going well. Have hiked in rain every day except day 5 and day7. Weather absolutely beautiful all day and we have made it to first hostel. Finally got a shower and clean clothes! Never knew a shower could feel so good. Mountain laurel is blooming and so beautiful right now. Trail has been moderate for the most part although quite a few climbs thrown in to keep it interesting. Been able to stay in a shelter every night so far and thank goodness as there as been heavy rain and thunderstorms 2-3 nights. Last night at Birch Run we had 14 people crammed into a shelter for 8! So far we have traveled 78.5 miles of trail plus all the side trails and stuff. We are planning to hit Boiling Springs, PA Friday morning to get bounce box and get fuel canister. We will have a 5 mile hike from Alec Kennedy Shelter into Boiling Springs and then 14.6 miles to first available camping/shelter. I have taken pictures but have had trouble uploading them due to signal strength. Will keep trying. Pine Grove Furnace State Park is the place where there is a General Store and they have a Half Gallon Challenge where you see if you can eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. I did it, I ate an entire half gallon of ice cream and it was delicious! Of course I will not need dinner that is for sure! Miss everyone and as technology allows I will follow Facebook to keep up. Happy Trails until next time!","Birch Run Shelter

Ganman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567055,Wow day 8. Weather perfect but last four miles was very difficult. Steep climbs and very rocky trails made for slower going than we would have liked but we made it! We will have an 18 mile day tomorrow whether we like it or not just the way the Trail goes.  Until another time......,"Iron masters Hostel
