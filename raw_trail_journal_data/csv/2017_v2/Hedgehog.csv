Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503332,Originally planned as a 3 day 2 night adventure with my friend from NJ. Due to the rain we lost a day. Decided to do an out and back easy 12 miles (or so I thought) with a night of camping. It was the hardest 13 miles I've done so far and the most worried I've ever been about my hiking partner. Will update more and tell full story in a couple of days.,"Snickers Gap

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/491233,Went for a great training hike today. 11.5 miles RT from trail head south of Pine Knob shelter to a bit north of Pogo Campground and back. Two beautiful vistas at Annapolis Rocks and Black Rock cliffs.,"pine knob shelter

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/491723,"Getting the gear ready. It's like Christmas unwrapping and inspecting all the great stuff. I'll probably forget the little (important) things like a ligher or matches, RX, phone... too distracted with my new tent and backpack! Getting ready to try it all out this weekend...just one night...but it will be my FIRST EVER night backpacking. Wish me luck...deathly afraid of bears!","

You understand weather patterns, knowing when it will rain. You are gentle yet protective of yourself at the same time. You know how to build defenses and protective barriers that discourage negativity. You have close ties to Mother Earth and love planting and gardening. You always tend to land on your feet and go through challenges in a calm, cool, practical way.Let's hope this totem will help guide me on my journey both on the trail and in life.","

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492351,"Well, I did it. My first night. For a girl who was afraid to camp in her own back yard, I'm proud of myself. I did it alone which I think I'm most proud of. I felt physically pushed, and mentally challenged. There's something about being pushed internally...feeling the muscles in your legs getting sore, but pushing up that next hill with a conviction because you know if you slow down at the bottom, the top will never get here. Then, getting to the top and not letting yourself rest...just yet..., because there's still several more miles to go and a sun that is setting.So, I did just about everything you are NOT suppose to do. I didn't get a chance to test or set up ANY of my equipment before hitting the trail (accept my hiking shoes which get lots of use). Trying to figure out the NASA engineering on your tent while racing the sun was interesting. But I figured it out. Strung up my bear bag... Cause as I might have mention that is my fear...bears. Didn't test out my jet boil...too lazy to eat dinner or breakfast for that matter. Cliff bar please. It's amazing how the trail seems to give you what you need. I stressed that I had forgotten ibuprofen and a lighter...I knew I'd forget the little, yet important things. Sure enough, found a lighter on the trail 2 miles in. And ended up not needing the ibuprofen. 
Watched a beautiful sunset from the rocks. One thru-hiker was playing a keytar in the background. I don't think I could have scripted a better end to my day and my first backpacking experience. (See video) Later I Made the acquaintance of three thru hikers at camp. Keytar, Smokes, and ironman. They started the trail in February. Keytar, aptly named for the instrument he carried, played some great little tunes to wind down the evening that blessed us with a Full moon. Comforted by knowing there were 'friends' just up the trail, I settled into my cozy tent and gazed at the floral shadows cast by the moon on my tent. If I had just a bit more courage I would have taken my rain fly off, but for for some reason that thin sheet of fabric made me feel more protected. I slept great, waking only twice. It's interesting the mix of emotions. Guilt for taking time away from family and obligations to do this. Pride in myself for tackling something that truly I was afraid of. Ecstatic that I woke this morning loving the experience. Now wrestling with how to balance all that I want to do in life and still give all that I have to give to those around me. I've felt selfish lately wanting and doing these things. But I know that I will be less of a person to those I love if I don't nourish and feed my soul too.","Dahl Hreen Campsite / South Mountain MD

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492356,"Woke up at 6:30. Beautiful morning. Packed up and hit the trail around 8am. Sad that the short experience was already getting close to ending. I would have loved to see what I could have accomplished had a set out at 8 am heading up the trail to the next destination. But I decided to turn back and head to the car so my husband wouldn't have to pick me up and shuttle me back. I didn't want to inconvenience him. It's amazing the number of people who are interested in you when you have a full pack on. Everyone asks or assumes you are a thru hiker.(couldn't they see how shines new and clean my gear was) I've day hiked the same sections dozens of times with no one talking to you. I guess, like me, they want to hear and experience that great adventure, at least vicariously through others if we can't do it ourselves. But I have to admit, even though this trip was only one night, I felt different, just carrying the pack made me feel different. I guess I felt like I was officially a backpacker now instead of just a hiker. Made it off the trail before noon. I probably won't be back on the AT for most of the month. Work obligations taking me out of town. But I will be leading a short hike into the Grand Canyon for some colleagues May 18th. I'm looking forward to that and then getting back here to the AT.","Annapolis Rocks

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497718,Opted for a quick hike this evening even though rain showers were predicted. Turned out to be a great decisions n since late start and slight rain kept almost everybody off the trail. Only past one person on the way out and no one on the way back. (Since it was past sunset that was no surprise) Had a nice chat with Dan the caretaker at Annapolis...very nice guy. I feel so lucky to be able to just jump out to this amazing trail for a quick 5 miles and a beautiful sunset.we live on a beautiful planet...I hope my children will get to enjoy it as well.,"RT 40 Parking near Greenbrier

Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527517,"Howdy Everyone,Long time, no entries. Been dealing with some health issues, but even more reason to get psyched for the upcoming hiking adventure. Not to worry...starting the AT section hikes next year is still in the agenda... But in the interim is a Grand Canyon rim to rim to rim excursion! 6 friends, 5 days, 4 nights, 45 miles, and 20k feet elevation change! Awesome. Start date is May 14, 2016. Put in for a permit and the gang is going! Had our first group call today to organize. Our group spans the nation from Alaska, California, Vermont, New Jersey, and Maryland! Thanks for all the support and well wishes. The last 6 months have brought significant health challenges, and this trip will be just what the doctor ordered for a full recovery! Cheers everyone to the start of new hiking adventures. Peace,HikingHedgehog~Turn your face towards the sun and let the shadows fall behind you",,prep: Grand Canyon R3,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Hedgehog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528284,"Happy Saturday Everyone,Had a wonderful 6.5 mile hike to Black Rocks Cliffs on the AT with 6 of Natural Resources and Conservation's finest champions. We spanned Maryland, Virginia, Montana, Idaho, and Arizona. I'm so glad I was able to share some of the AT with these special people. I also had to begin getting in the miles in preparation for the Grand Canyon R3 hike next month. Just had surgery last week so was happy to get in 11 miles on the trail this week. Onward and upward!!","prep: Grand Canyon R3
