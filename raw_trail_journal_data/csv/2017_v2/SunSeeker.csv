SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556829,"I am so excited to be returning to the trail. I will be starting my thru-hike on Sunday, April 2, from Atkins, VA hiking north to Mt Katahdin where Mark, my husband, will pick me up and I’ll return to Atkins, VA hiking south to Springer Mountain. Depending on when I reach Mt Katahdin, I will either go directly to Atkins to hike south or return home for a couple weeks before going to Atkins. We have an extended family vacation planned in September that will help determine what I do.Why Atkins? The main reason is that I’ve hiked everything south of Atkins before. In 2009, I hiked from Springer to Damascus, VA and while living in North Carolina I hiked the Damascus to Atkins section. I really liked the Grayson Highlands area and did quite a few overnight trips in this area. So, if for some reason this hike ends early, I will have covered new ground. Atkins also allows for some shorter sections with Trent’s Grocery, Pearisburg, Four Pines Hostel and Daleville nicely spaced for resupply and showers during the beginning of the hike.Hopefully, I will be avoiding the huge bubbles. I love being around other hikers and everything that includes, but not as large as what is hitting the Smokies this week. The snow storm has them stacked up in large numbers right now. I read in someone’s journal that as many as 60 hikers left Fontana Dam on Thursday to enter the park. I’d like to avoid numbers quite that large. The main group leaving Springer will undoubtedly reach me, but the number of hikers should be smaller then what originally started.By starting at mile 544 on April 2, the time constraint of hitting Mt Katahdin before it closes is pretty much eliminated unless I go at quite the snail’s pace. This allows me a little more freedom with my time and pace. I want to keep it about the journey and not the destination.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sat",0
SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556884,"I got off the trail in 2009 for several reasons: my feet were killing me, it stopped being fun and I missed Mark tremendously.I never did really figure out what was going on with my feet. I have an extremely high arch and the front of my foot is very wide although not long enough to be able to wear men’s shoes. I now hike with arch supports and I finally found a pair of boots that gives the front of my foot plenty of space even at the end of the day when my feet are tired and swollen. Last time I hiked in trail runners, but have chosen the La Sportive FC 4.0 GTX Hiking Boots this time. I like the vibram sole which reduces the pounding the front of my foot takes. They feel lighter on my feet then most boots and really give the front of my foot plenty of space while allowing me to lock the heel in place. My feet may very well end up being as sore as last time. I’ll let you know in May.I really need to make sure I hike my own hike and keep the trip about the journey and not the destination. At the beginning of my 2009, I was having a wonderful time. I actually hiked down other trails to see some sights when it was so foggy I couldn’t see any of the sights on the trail. The last couple of weeks I started hiking with another hiker. I really liked hiking with Tanglefoot, but I lost control somewhat of my hike. It started being about the miles, picking up the pace and the final destination. I need to stay in control of my hike. Missing Mark. Oh how I missed him during my 2009 hike. It seemed like I hardly ever had a signal in the towns on my phone and I didn’t’ have texting capabilities. This time if I have a signal on top of a mountain in the middle of the wilderness, I will call home even if it is just to say hello. We can also text to stay in better touch. I can also text other family and friends which will help with the homesickness. Since we live in Ohio instead of Texas this time, he is a lot closer if I just HAVE to see him. Bottom line: I know more about what to expect on a long distance hike and I am, hopefully, mentally tougher.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Sun",0
SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556889,"I need three entries to go live, so I thought I’d talk a little about a few things I hope to do differently.In 2009, I stayed in shelters the majority of the time. There are so many positives about staying around the shelters. They usually have a reliable water source close by, the other hikers that congregate around them in the evening provide some wonderful social interaction, most have privies and when it’s raining they draw me in like bee to honey. However, they aren’t always spaced well for me and I never sleep all that well. Of course, I still plan on using them, but if I get to a shelter early and it’s too far to the next one, I will tent somewhere along the way. Between Awol’s trail guide and Guthook’s phone app, I should be able to look ahead and figure out the likelihood of finding an adequate tent site. The army did teach me to read topographical maps which will also help in this endeavor. I may not have a site with water, but I will plan accordingly.Make my daily mileage about how my body feels that day instead of hitting predetermined location. This sounds like common sense, but I tended to make a plan for stops for the next section while in the preceding town. I then followed that plan. If I got to a shelter early, I’d stop early. If I was exhausted, I’d do the miles anyway as there was a deadline of hitting My Katahdin before it closed. I hope this time to listen to my body more. I’m a planner, this will be easier said than done. But I will try to stay aware.I am doing maildrops again; however, it will only include breakfast and dinners and my dinners will include much more variety. I will buy lunches and snacks in the towns according to what I want at that time. All my dinners in 2009 were just add boiling water and wait. I have some of those, some Lipton sides with ingredients to add and some “homemade” meals. Some of these do require some “cooking”, but I like food and I like variety. And whenever possible, take lunch/dinner from a Subway or some other portable “real” food as I leave town.I’m excited to get this hike going. I am a much more experienced backpacker and I’m ready.",,The Third Entry,"Mar 19, Sun",0
SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558687,"What a beautiful day to start my hike! Mark and Steve dropped me off at the trail head. Steve took some pictures of my departure -- I can't wait to see them. It was really hard to say goodbye to Mark, but hopefully I will see him again over Memorial Day Weekend. The trail today started off fairly flat which was a very nice way to start the day. Usually when I leave town the trail likes to go straight up, so it was a nice surprise. The trail had a little bit of everything today. I went through several open wide pastures that give lovely views of rural Virginia farmland. I saw lovely little farms while dodging some cow patties, but didn't see any actual cows. I did hear them though. In one pasture, I decided to take a break, enjoy the sunshine and check out some birds overhead. The monocular showed them to be vultures that came to circle over where I was sitting. I told them I was still alive and kicking and they flew back to their original location. I walked by babbling brooks and a creek with cascades. I walked under several Rhododendron tunnels and can't wait to see them bloom. I had to go over and through what felt like a dozen stiles. The majority were ladders requiring me to climb up one side and down the other. Those had an opening close to the ground for dogs to duck under. The ladders would be hard for a dog to negotiate. They keep the cows where they belong I guess. I had to climb several mountains and for the most part they were nicely graded with switchbacks. There was only one section coming down that had a lot of rocks to be negotiated. It took awhile for the traffic of I-81 by the trail head to fade away, but when I left that behind I heard many birds. I even saw a few. I saw a squirrel hanging out on the trail that decided I needed to be scolded about something before he scampered off. I saw some pretty wildflowers which made my day as well. I was originally going to stop at Possum Campsite a couple miles before the shelter. It was a very pretty setting, but a little to close to a busy road for me. It was only 3:30 anyway; therefore, I hiked to the shelter. I did fine with the mileage and just struggled a bit with the last climb of the day. I saw a couple hiking southbound that were hiking with a baby. She was carrying the baby in a carrier on her back and he seemed quite happy and content. They started in Catawba and are doing a southbound flip flop. I wished them much success on their journey!The only other hiker I met today was Salesman. Very nice guy that is staying here at the shelter as well. We had dinner and a nice chat about his trip so far. The weather is gorgeous so I decided to tent just a bit away from the shelter. No cables here for my feedbag so I had to string a rope for my food. As always, it took several tries to get the rope over a branch, but success was finally mine. Tomorrow will probably be a shorter day for me. I have the biggest climb of the week and a thunderstorm is predicted for tomorrow evening/night. The first shelter is at 9 miles and the next at 20 miles. I think 20 is a bit much, so 9 it is. If we do get the thunderstorm, I'd like to be in the shelter. We shall see what the day holds and I will see how I feel in the morning. I do hope I get many more days like today.","Atkins, VA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558773,"I slept really well last night. I was off a bit from the shelter and it was extremely quiet and peaceful. I was up and packed and on the trail by 7:30. There are thunderstorms in the forecast and I will be going up and across an open ridge line. The biggest climb of the week is today with a 2000 feet of elevation change. 
I talked to Salesman and Script as I was leaving. Salesman is headed to the next hostel and Script is headed to the next shelter 10 miles from this one. One thing about starting at Atkins is that everyone I see already has their trail legs and soon leave me behind. I just have to do what I can do. Script did say there was a slower group behind me but wasn't sure how far behind. But with the miles Script can do, I'm not sure what slower really means.
The hike started out pretty nice this morning with a nice downhill start. It was fairly warm, but overcast. Definitely a nice way to start the day. I was soon headed up the first upgrade. Salesman passed me and said it was just a bump. It felt like it was bigger then a bump to me! Then some more downhill until I started the 2000 ft climb. It had a lot of steps built in and it was very steep in sections. I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Did you just see that? Script flew past at a very fast clip. I just kept plodding along. About 4 miles to my destination, I walked into the open clearing of Chestnut Ridge. The climbing wasn't as bad from this point forward There were many little birds in the clearing and I enjoyed their company. I love to hear them sing. About 2 miles from my destination is a pretty little pond which is also the water source for the shelter. I stopped to fill up with water and it started to drizzle. I went ahead and put my pack cover on and my rain gear. As I continued my trek, the fog started rolling in as well as getting quite windy. And then the skies opened and buckets started falling. The fog was getting quite dense and I was hoping I didn't just walk right past the shelter. 
And then I saw a four sided shelter with a door!!!! Marvelous shelter. When I walked in Script was still there eating lunch. We talked a bit while he packed up. I got here quite early after only doing a little over nine miles, but this is my home for the night. The shelter has a tin roof and I can barely here myself think it is so loud. But I'm warm and dry and happy. The privy is a three sided affair that I will only visit in between lulls in the rain. I hope there are some lulls anyway. 
So this evening, I will read and relax. Tomorrow has a lot of down, but I will have to tent somewhere tomorrow night. The shelters are about 10 miles apart and 10 isn't enough and 20 is too far. Hopefully the weather is a little better. But I am extremely happy to be here and dry. 
The rain ended in time for me to see a beautiful sunset. I can also see the views from up here on the ridge. Looking south is a wonderful mountain view with the sunset make the clouds very colorful. Looking north is a beautiful valley view, but I don't know what town I'm looking at. Pretty though.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558900,"I did not sleep well last night. The wind was gusting causing the door to bounce open and shut. Once I didn't think any other hikers were going to show up, I looped a rope that was around the door handle and some nails there. Once that was quiet the mice were out. They buried acorns in my boots and chewed a hole in my compactor bag, both noisy and pesty. There was another hiker there with me with a newer Thermarest. It is more comfortable and lighter weight then the old one, but it makes a tremendous amount of noise whenever the sleeper moves. In the morning, she thought I had slept well, but I just said I have a quieter sleeping pad. I packed up early and hit the trail. It was quite foggy and windy up on top of the ridge when I set out. For awhile I would dip down below the fog (would that make it clouds instead of fog) and then climb back up into the fog. It finally cleared up and ended up being another magnificent day. AWOL's guide to the Appalachian Trail showed very little elevation gain today, but it pretty much went up and down all day just in smaller amounts at one time then yesterday. One of the features listed in AWOL's guide to the Appalachian Trail today was the Garden Mountain, rock outcropping at mile 570.5 (mileage is from Springer Mountain in Georgia). However, I saw so many rock outcroppings today I have no idea which he was referencing. So I picked one in the sun and had my morning snack. Rocks were definitely a part of the hike today. They make me walk a bit slower as I have to adjust to step on, over, or around them. Some of the white blazes have been painted brown. What is up with that?!?!? Several times I thought I had somehow gotten on another trail marked with brown blazes. I'd walk a bit further and see a white blaze. Not sure what the brown blazes are for. I've heard of white, blue, pink and yellow blazes, but not brown. I only saw a couple people today. One woman I met at 3:30 or so that was hiking to the shelter I left at 7:30 in the morning. She must be a much faster hiker then me. I saw another woman just out for a day hike with her baby. Great day for a day hike! I saw two other backpackers going the same direction as me, but they were towards the end of their day and we're exhausted and not in the mood for talking. I am at a great campsite tonight, it even has a picnic table. Picnic tables always make me smile. There are pine trees around a nice flowing creek. The babbling creek should make sleeping nice tonight. Hope so anyway. On that note I'm going to hit the sleeping bag.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559067,"I slept so good last night. I was tired after a long day of hiking. I haven't slept that well in a long time. I woke up at 6 and was on the trail by 7. The first part of the day was a pretty ridge walk. I had fresh legs so the hike to the top of the ridge was not too bad. The trail followed the creek with some cascades for awhile. Always nice. I waited till I got to the top to eat breakfast and enjoyed the early morning sun. I had a signal so sent yesterday's? journal to my husband and replied to some messages. Very pleasant start to the day. For some reason my pack was putting pressure on my right hip which it hadn't before. So I stopped once again to figure out what was wrong and I had packed a few things backwards. I changed the arrangement and then it felt fine. Weird how weight needs to be closer to the body. The sounds for the day was mostly traffic. Not very peaceful at all. I thought it odd, but the trail went up to a road. The trail almost always goes down to a road, so this was a bit odd. Then the trail followed the road for quite some time. I detest road walking and would have gladly yellow blazed that section if given the chance. I passed two groups of people standing around work trucks talking and said hi to both. After I walked past, the first group started talking about the thru-hikers starting to appear like we are a migratory species. I guess it is like that for the locals. The next group had a guy who inquired about the condition of my feet and told me to keep following the road. I walked over I-77 and waved at the cars, trucks and RVs. I finally made it to the parking lot where the trail goes back into the woods. Guess what I found in the parking lot. A trashcan?! I consider it my first trail magic as I love to get rid of my trash. It had a sign by it that stated ""Please...No Deer Carcasses. blue barrels provided & maintained by 78 year old lady & 70 year old gentleman"". Well I didn't leave a deer carcass, but thank you for allowing me to lighten my load a bit. I was very happy to be back in the woods and continued on my way. My plan was to get to Helveys Mill Shelter to filter enough water to dry camp about 5 miles further up the trail. I arrived at the shelter around noon and it was 0.3 of a mile off the trail and the water was 0.3 of a mile past the shelter straight down. That added 1.2 miles to my day, but a hiker needs water. While I was there I met four other hikers. Everyone was talking about the horrible storm coming. One couple and their adorable little dog were staying put. The other two were headed to the next shelter. But the theme was the storm coming. I was not sure what I should do. By then it was 1, but that seemed way to early to stop and the next shelter was too far away for me to reach. I decided to just go. I ran into 3 ladies headed south bound and they were talking about the storm as well. They were concerned about me being on the ridge for the night. There are several campsites up there, but they were all very exposed to the weather. I decided to bypass them and eventually headed down off the ridge. I decided to stealth camp down in this little valley and will tent for the evening. I will let you know tomorrow if I regret my decision. Thursday morning: I heard the wind howling last night, but didn't feel it down in this valley. I had some rain, but that's about it. This was a good place to spend the night. To Trent's Grocery today. Snow may have me adjust for the next couple of days.","Laurel Creek Campsite

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559305,"Wow what to say about today... I woke up, threw back my tent fly door and had breakfast in bed. I must have disturbed a turkey when I was getting my feed bag out of the tree, because he gobbled until I left. I had a hard time packing up because I was trying to beat the rain but kept messing things up. Was finally out of there by 8 AM. My destination today was Trent's Grocery for a hamburger, shower and laundry. Day started with an uphill which warmed me up. The weather couldn't decide whether it wanted to rain or be sunny. I took my rain jacket on and off several times and finally just left it on even though I get warm with it on. I had some good views today much like the ones I have everyday. These are to be savored because once the trees leaf out the majority of those will be gone. I saw a blue jay but that was about it for wildlife. As I was dropping down into the valley to head to Trent's, I started seeing different kinds of wildflowers. Oh I forget to tell you yesterday that I saw dogwood's blooming or I thought they were blooming anyway. The bushes and trees in the lower elevations are showing signs of life as well. When I arrived at VA 606, I called for a shuttle, but no one was available to come get me. So I did another half mile road walk. I was able to get a delicious hamburger with fries and a Pepsi; however, she wasn't sure if the showers and laundry we're available. Originally, I had planned to just camp there at the store, but I was the only hiker around and didn't want to camp there by myself. I decided to skip the shower and just head back to find a campsite. I bought a few items and walked the half mile back to the trail. I called Woods Hole Hostel to make a reservation for tomorrow night. They don't take reservations, but he thinks there should be room in the bunkhouse. It's 13 miles up the trail and I look forward to being out of the weather for the night. I found a lovely little campsite by Dismal Creek that I'd love to visit in warmer months. Tonight it is just a refuse for me. There are conflicting weather reports about what is coming tonight. So rain and somewhere between 0 and 2 inches of snow. If I don't feel safe hiking out of here tomorrow, I will just hunker down. I have the equipment, plenty of food and water to be fine. I'd be bored out of my mind, but I'll be fine. It isn't really supposed to get below freezing, so I think hiking out will be fine. The trail tomorrow starts with a tough climb up, but that will help me stay warm. I hope to be at the hostel tomorrow afternoon sometime.","Stealth site north of VA 611

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559405,"It rained on and off last night, but no snow. I tend to wake up early, so I had a leisurely breakfast in bed while reading a book on my phone. It was sure colder this morning then it has been making it hard to leave my cocoon of feathers. When I finally started packing up, there were flurries in the air. I had a decent climb of 2,000 ft at the beginning of the hike taking me up to a higher elevation and I pretty much stay up there for the rest of the day. The higher I climbed the more snow I saw on the sides of the trail. The trail stayed pretty clear at first. I crossed many streams today, many with foot bridges. I thanked the trail maintainers many times today for those bridges. Helped keep my feet nice and dry. I still had to rock hop across several streams and the trail itself turned into a small stream in places, but I managed to keep my feet dry. Like the sign says ""bridges freeze before roads"" or in this case ""before trails"", all the footbridges were already snow covered. A set of boot prints across each bridges let me know someone was just ahead of me. Whoever it was dragged their hiking poles across every bridge. For some reason, I thought that funny. I did find it was best to walk outside of those prints as they were icy and slippery. I was very cautious going across as I didn't want to fall.I was enjoying the walk today even with the colder temps and snow. The rhododendron tunnels were especially pretty with a dusting of snow on their leaves. I passed Wapiti Shelter and was soon passed by two younger hikers starting their days hike from there. They were on a mission and not thrilled by the weather one bit. We didn't say much besides hello. I could hear the wind blowing pretty good and I wasn't looking forward to an exposed ridge walk when I reached the top. Luckily for me, this trail did not stay right on the tippy top of the ridge making the majority of my hike wind free. However, when I reached the top the trail was covered with a couple inches of snow and became very rocky. I took my time negotiating the snowy, rocky trail. I didn't take any snack breaks, but chose to eat bars warmed up inside my jacket when I found myself on easier patches of terrain. It was very beautiful and I did try to appreciate the scenery around me.The miles seemed long today, I guess because I was trying to be more cautious and going slower. I finally reached the exit for the hostel. Just a half a mile down and I do mean down a gravel road to my destination. All I could think while walking down was I'd have to walk back up that tomorrow. I met Cheap Sunglasses out for a stroll and he assured me there was plenty of room at the hostel. I think he is doing a work-for-stay there for a couple weeks. I finally arrived and Neville greeted me and said there was room in the bunk house, but since it was so cold out I could take a shower and hang out in the house for the day. I dumped my pack in the bunk house which is not heated and very, very drafty. I think bunk house guests are usually not allowed to hang out in the house, so I'm very glad this rule was bent for the day. It would have been a miserable day otherwise. The hostel owners ask guests to help out while there...kind of in a communal way. I stacked wood, helped with dinner and breakfast, and did some laundry. We still had plenty of time to just hang out and rest. I didn't mind and enjoyed the presence of those around me. I hadn't really talked to anybody for a couple days. The meals were very good and I met some amazing people. Neville was running the show on her own, because her husband, Michael, was away on a mini-vacation before the hiker season starts in earnest. Besides Neville, I met Gator and his family who were visiting him, Sparkles, Dory, Gap, Doc, Tunes and Nepal (I don't quite have her name right). There was never a dull moment and I enjoyed the afternoon very much. If you like to people watch, this was a prime location. When I decided to stop there to get a respite from the weather, I didn't know the bunk house wasn't heated. It is a converted barn I think. The bathroom was outside in another building, so I stopped drinking anything quite early in the evening. I didn't want to climb out of my sleeping bag, down the ladder from the loft, fight with the stupid door and go outside to use the facilities in the middle of the night. Haha. I said stupid door, because it was large and I had the hardest time closing it all the way. I slept in my sleeping bag and stayed nice and toasty. We bunk house guests were invited back into the house at 6:30 to help with breakfast. I was back there at 6:40 to help. The price of my stay included getting my laundry done. When I do laundry on the trail, I do everything except my rain gear. There are extra clothes to wear while waiting for those so I hung out in my rain pants and loaner fleece. However, I didn't think I was ever going to get my clothes back. Neville just kept saying she'd do them soon. She was stretched a bit thin trying to do everything. I went to bed in my rain pants and loaner fleece. The next morning still no clothes. I was so happy when she asked me to help with laundry as I was finally in control of getting my clothes back. I was able to change into my clothes right before breakfast! Made me very happy. Those who know me well know that I'm an extreme introvert. I like meeting and being around people, but it really saps my energy when it is over such a long period of time. Neville is a special soul and I'm glad I had the experience of meeting her and spending time at the hostel. It was amazing. I left there tired, but also rejuvenated.","Stealth site at Dismal Creek

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559409,"After breakfast at the hostel, we all helped clean up and repacked our packs to once again hit the trail. It was a much later start to the day then normal, but it was a short mileage day with easy terrain ahead. The weather was warming up and it promised to be a magnificent day. So, less difficult then yesterday. The day's walk started with the half mile walk up the gravel road to the trail head. Neville did make a comment that the hostel was called Woods HOLE for a reason. Haha. The trail was still a bit snowy, but the sun was out and things were quickly melting. I played leap frog with Nepal for most of the day. Today was a day for brilliant views. I had a short climb and then walked along a cliff with views to the right almost all day. I took many mini-breaks to enjoy the views and all the birds flying around. I even saw a deer today. Lunch came much earlier today with the late start. I found a nice spot in the woods and Nepal came by and joined me. It was nice to hear about her many adventures including time spent in Scotland, Israel and New Zealand over the past year. During the day, I saw quite a few hawks flying just off the edge of the cliffs. The monocular came in handy watching them soar. I thought about sending the monocular home to save a bit of pack weight, but I enjoy it too much. Definitely a luxury item, but it brings me great enjoyment. I have it in easy reach and whip it out often.I came across a couple locals out enjoying the weather at an outcropping of rocks with a great view. I took another break and enjoyed their company and the view. We saw a large amount of smoke out in the distance and they kept trying to count the mountains to figure out where it was coming from. They never did come to a consensus on that, but they thought it was probably a bush fire. I hope whatever it was that it's contained. It was great meeting them. I came to a blue blazed trail to Angels Rest, a couple large boulders over looking Pearisburg. I met a couple of college kids with their dog and they took a picture of me. I talked with them for awhile and then started the long descent into Pearisburg. It is long and it just kept going down. I kept thinking I'm glad I'm going North and down this mountain instead of up. Then I started wondering what the climb out of Pearisburg is going to be like. I met a section hiker named Base Jumper who was climbing up. He was in no hurry to go up, so another conversation was enjoyed. He told me he got his name when a friend was taking his picture at a ledge, he decided to take a step back and fell off the ledge. What?!?! Luckily for him the drop was only 7 feet or so into a bush with stickers. He was cut up, but okay. His friend looked over the edge to see if he was okay and then named him Base Jumper. I finally came to the road to take me into Pearisburg which meant another road walk, 0.9 miles this time, into town. Just as I started walking a truck drives by and offers me a ride. Woohoo!! I hopped in and between us is a magnificent bear skin that he cured. I couldn't stop touching the thing. It was a short, but incredible ride as he talked about the process of curing the hide. Very nice guy and thanks for the ride!I went to the Hostel and as I walked up they asked if I was there for the beer fest. Hmmmmmm.... I said nope, just to get my mail-drop. Beer fest did not sound like a peaceful time to me although it has great appeal for many hikers. I am staying at a little hotel instead. It works better as well, as my sister, Lynn, is coming for a visit tomorrow. I'm right across from a Food Lion and decided to get dinner from there instead of going to a restaurant. I purchased chicken strips, chips, and salad for dinner and some fruits and cheese for breakfast tomorrow. I don't have the great hiker appetite yet and it worked out fine. I cleaned up, talked to Mark and vegged for the rest of the evening. Somehow my backpack has exploded across the entire room, but I will figure that out tomorrow.","Woods Hole Hostel

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559752,"There is something wrong with my right big toe. It looks like I have a plum stuck on the end of it. I haven't had a blister on it and I haven't injured it in anyway, but it keeps getting worse every day. It doesn't really hurt and I have no idea what is going on with it. My sister, Lynn, is planning on coming down to spend the day and I think the fun day we had planned is going to change to getting the toe looked at. There isn't an urgent care in Pearisburg, but a nearby town has one. We'll see...Ends up I have an infection under my toenail. The nurse practitioner couldn't believe it didn't hurt when she moved the nail around. It was like it was floating. She drained it which seriously hurt! She said it is usually caused by an ingrown toenail and not anything I'd done in the past couple of days. I'd probably just cut my nails to short before starting the trail last week and gotten an ingrown toenail. Never had one before. I asked her if I could keep hiking and she said yes, but I'd need to soak it three or four times a day in a warm Epsom salt solution and keep the hole she put in it super clean. She also said it would take longer to heal if I kept hiking. Well, I just couldn't imagine trying to soak my big toe in my little cook pot or keeping my feet super clean. So even though the weather is looking absolutely fabulous this week, I'm headed back to my sister's home for the week. She doesn't live far and can bring me back next weekend. Really bummed me out, but I know I made the right decision to let it heal. Something that would be a very minor blip in my everyday life normally has brought me to a total standstill.","Pearisburg, VA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560644,"The sunset last night was a wonderful way to end the day. I slept okay last night, but not great. I woke up several times throughout the night. I hope this isn't a trend. I had breakfast in bed again and was welcomed to the morning with a fabulous sunrise. What a great way to start Easter Day. By the way, Happy Easter everyone!   Besides the great sunrise, I met some great hikers today: The father - daughter duo of Grits and Treeline and a couple named Farley and Bird (I don't know if they were a couple, but they were hiking together). I played leapfrog with them several times as they hiked faster, but took lots of breaks. They went 5 miles past my site tonight, so I probably won't see them again. I would have enjoyed getting to know them better, but the ones that started at Springer have way better endurance then me and I usually don't see them again. The trail was tough today. I had to go about 7 miles before I arrived at the first water source of the day. I was very happy to fill up and drank quite a bit right there. There were several hard ups spread out over the day and a couple sections that had a tremendous amount of rocks and boulders. The trail just didn't have many redeeming qualities at all today. Several of the ups seemed especially steep and could have used a few switchbacks. The really steep sections take a lot out of me and I have to stop to catch my breath. If they are more gradual, then I can hike constantly although slowly. It started drizzling on the last four miles. Part of it was very rocky and they can get slick when they get wet. I tried to stay very aware of my foot placements and I made it to my campsite with no problems. It stopped drizzling just as I pulled in to my campsite. Windrock is another great campsite with some great views and another lovely sunset was given. It is a dry campsite like last night's, so water had to be carted up from below.   I have been joined by three hikers tonight, but I'm not sure if they are staying or just enjoying the views. They haven't set up camp, but out enjoying the night sky on the rocks. I went up to watch the sunset with them, but came down as it got dark. I am quite tired tonight and I'm hoping for a better sleep tonight.","Sister's House

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560645,"I forgot to tell you about the tremendous amount of down trees that had to be negotiated yesterday. One of the shelters I passed was actually closed as the number of dead trees in the area are considered a risk. I had a bit of trouble getting over/under some of the large trees lying across the trail. It wasn't a very pretty area with all the dead trees. It will probably stand out even more when the leaves of the live trees come out. The wind howled around Wind Rock last night, but the rocks themselves shielded me from the wind. Crispy, Tumbleweed and Peaches did spend the night in the area as well. I tried sleeping in a bit today, but was still on the trail by 8. I started my day by going south, but I was able to get cell service to send yesterday's journal to Mark and a couple text messages. I didn't go very far south before I realized my mistake and turned in the right direction. The trail was very nice all the way to the War Spur Shelter. I rounded a bend and there was a doe right in the trail about 20 ft from me. I just stopped to watch her and when she finally noticed me, she slowly walked in to the forest. Nice encounter. I caught up with Crispy, Peaches and Tumbleweed at the shelter about 10 for a snack and water fill up. I spent about a half hour with them and had a nice time getting to know them a little. It started to drizzle a bit while we were there and it continued to rain most of the day. Just a gentle rain, so not to horrible. The next section was a hard up for me. While at the shelter, Tumbleweed said that even though she has been out here since February, she still has to take breaks on tough uphill climbs. The breaks are less frequent, but still required. I left the shelter before her and she passed me and I didn't see her take one break. She was probably just being nice. The last .6 of the climb was very steep. It was wider then normal, rocky of course, and had what I call speed bumps (really they divert water away from the trail), because they really slow me down. The fog appeared as I climbed up the mountain. There was supposed to be a view up there called Kelly's Knob. All I saw was fog. I took a short break where the view was supposed to be and then passed a hiker going the other way. I asked him what direction he was headed and he looked at me very strangely. I just wanted to make sure I was traveling the right way. Haha. I was. I then walked down out of the fog to Laurel Creek Shelter for another break. Tumbleweed was still there, but moved out shortly. I filled up with the water I'd need for the night and morning as I was headed to another dry camp. I walked thru some pastures at the end of the day and saw lots of cows in the distance. I do like the change of scenery that pastures give me. I arrived at where I wanted to camp and Trinity, Hugs, and Falls were already set up. I found a spot I liked and set up camp. It stopped raining while I set up my tent. Very nice indeed. Hugs started a wonderful fire and we all had dinner around the fire while a gentle rain fell. Very nice evening visiting with them. I am starting to see more hikers and I think the next shelter is crowded tonight. They told me it was haunted and they were looking forward to spending the night there. I really felt the climb today. I plan on doing a bit shorter day tomorrow and I won't have to lug any water to it!","Wind Rock

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560799,"I knew I had a shorter day today, so I tried to get a later start. My camp mates said they were getting up at 5 and leaving at 6. They were still in there tents at 8 when I left. I had a rough morning though. It is what I call my garbage can days...I am 52, this stuff should have stopped by now for crying out loud. It was a very, very low energy day for me for sure. I thought it was going to be an easy day with just one big uphill to the top of Sinking Creek Mountain in the morning, then down the other side. I was able to fill up with water rather quickly, so I made a quick stop to replenish my supply. I freed some type of bug that has been hitchhiking on my water bladder. I don't know when I picked him up. My filter is running a little slow. I will ask about it at the outfitters in Daleville. I've had it for awhile and I may need to replace the filter on my filter. I think I'll get some backup drops as well. Shortly after I started again, I saw the Keffer Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT in the South. It's over 300 years old. It looked mighty impressive. I would love to see it with leaves. I liked today's guidebook landmarks, because they were definitive and I knew where I was on mileage most of the day. Some times it's just stream, stream, view and I'm never sure which one they are referring. I made the big climb okay today. I had to take a lot of mini-breaks on the way up. Once at the top I saw Bruisers Knob Cairns. For over a mile on top of this mountain are all these rather large rock Cairns. It says they were put there by early farmers for what purpose I have no idea.I passed by Sarver Hollow Shelter, the haunted shelter, but it was 0.4 miles down off the trail and I decided to walk right past it. Then the views! What they really meant by views today was large boulders slanted rather steeply to the right. In most places, if I had fallen I wouldn't have gone to far before being stopped by a tree. A couple would have been a long slide indeed. I am so glad it wasn't raining today. They would have been impossibly slippery for me. It was slow going for me through this area. A couple places, I sat on my butt and scooted or just crawled up some trickier places. The younger hikers just zoom right through. I am not sure at what age a person gets a little more cautious. I must say there were some awesome views off to the right. I wish those types of views showed up on camera better. I did take some breaks on this section to soak in some of the sights. I will admit I was kind of glad when they were finally over. I met an older day hiker towards the end of the boulders that counted 27 north bounders today and it wasn't even 11 o'clock yet. I haven't seen that many people, but I do have more people passing me every day then the first week. Most aren't very chatty, just say thanks when I step to the side and let them pass. Most started in February, but I'm seeing more early March hikers as well. I passed by a survey marker for the Appalachian Trail. Pretty cool. I tried to find one on top of Peter's Mountain that actually said Peter's Mountain, but no luck. Next on today's agenda was the Eastern Continental Divide. There was a sign posted: 1920 to the Gulf and 405 to the Atlantic. Cool. I like signs!For wildlife sighting today, I saw many squirrels and chipmunks. Several squirrels scolded me very loudly as I walked by. I hear a lot more then I actually see. Always fun to see them though. After the divide I headed down to the Niday Shelter. It was down, but for some reason a hard down with lots of boulders and rocks along the way. Right before the shelter I saw a beautiful tree in bloom that had a couple yellowtail swallow butterflies. Or I think that's there name anyway. I stopped to watch them flutter around for a while. One left the tree to check me out, but decided the tree tasted better and returned to the tree. Spring is really here! I am seeing more and more wildflowers, trees with leaves and butterflies. At Niday Shelter, I met Uncle Sunshine. We both had a snack and found we were headed to the same campsite tonight. He is a section hiker that can do huge miles out of the gate. He did 18 yesterday on his first day out. I've never done 18. After a couple miles, I arrived at Craig Creek for the night. It is nestled in a little valley and a nice place to spend the night. There is a creek, but barely. I was able to get water and I didn't have to lug it here which made me happy. I am looking forward to a good night's sleep (hopefully). Tomorrow is another short day, but it has two big climbs for me. One first thing and one later in the day. It is supposed to rain all day as well. I hope my energy level gets better by morning.","Stealth campsite just between Sinking Creek and Ke

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561290,"I actually slept till 6:30 this morning. I woke around 3:30, took me awhile but I fell back to sleep. Slept really hard and had very strange dreams. Felt nice getting some good sleep. I had to make a choice today on mileage between lugging water over the second mountain to camp or just hike a couple miles more and go to Four Pines Hiker Hostel. I am soooo happy I did not decide to lug water today. It was raining when I woke up, so packed my pack as much as possible inside my tent. I was lucky that there was a short pause in the rain to take down a very wet tent and to finish packing. I had some anxiety about the terrain today, because a comment on Guthook's app stated going north bound after Dragon's Tooth was a bit treacherous in the rain. The forecast was for rain. The first hump today was not as bad as I thought it would be. I did meet three hikers that I would hike with most of the day. Gigline, LG and Speck were my guardian angels today. They are all very strong experienced hikers that I enjoyed spending time with. Great people indeed!I saw the Audie Murphy Monument. Very cool. I didn't stay long since it was raining and I got chilled when I stopped for very long. However, I am much more acclimated to the weather this trip then 2009. I was cold most of that trip and have felt quite comfortable this time. My blood is much thicker living in Ohio then when I was living in Texas. Thank goodness.Speck thru-hiked a couple years ago and I asked her about the trail coming down off of Dragon's Tooth. She mentioned rebar steps, but said it wasn't that bad, not very long and actually a lot of fun. Coming down off of Brush Mountain, I hiked behind Gigline for awhile and talked with him. It was really nice to have someone to talk with for awhile. Going down was the only time I could keep up with these guys. I saw a spot today that I would have stayed and chilled for awhile if it was a sunny warm day. A little grassy meadow in the middle of nowhere surrounded with a grove of tulip trees with new leaves. Dogwood trees and a tree with small purple flowers were sprinkled within the grove. It was just one of those spots that just spoke to me. The second climb took me to the Dragons Tooth. I don't even know how to describe the trail thru this section. I was a bit behind the other 3 as they go uphill quicker then I do. I had to climb over this boulder and I had a heck of a time with it, but finally got over it. A short time after that boulder I caught up with LG who was taking a break and I stayed with them the rest of the day. The side trail to the Dragons Tooth was short and it would have looked really cool if it wasn't so foggy. Then we started down, over, up, around some serious rocks and boulders. It was like working our way thru a 3 dimensional maze. Some sections were so steep there was rebar steps provided to assist us. Several parts required me to sit down and just slide down a bit. The sliding down tore a hole in my rain cover. Oops. It wasn't raining at this time, but the rocks we're wet and slippery.   I thought it was challenging and glad to have some other hikers with me as I went thru that part. It took quite awhile and right when I thought it was over there more rocks and boulders in the way. I'm not doing justice on this section. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't lug extra water down off of Dragon's Tooth to camp at a dry site tonight!Oh and Speck said this is what New Hampshire is like, but instead of short sections it last all day. Hmph. I went by many potential spots for views today, but they were mostly fogged in. Only thing to do is say ""wonderful view"" to the wall of white and walk on. We finally made it to the road to the hostel and were picked up quickly and brought in. It is a very interesting place. I got a hot shower (no towels provided), a bed for the night (just a mattress, no sheets or covers) and have meet some more incredible hikers and one Scottish biker going across the US. Great fun.I talked with LG and Gigline about improving my attack of going up mountains. Currently, I take frequent short stops as I go up. Their advice was to just keep walking, take small steps and don't stop for short breaks. It's okay to slow down, just shorten the steps and keep going forward. The reason being that it takes a lot of different muscles to get up a mountain and takes a lot of energy to get those muscles to start moving. So just keep going and keep those muscles active. I will try this method. Completely worn out though and will hopefully be asleep soon.","Stealth campsite on Craig Creek

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561291,"I woke up ready to leave the hostel and get on the trail. Today I will see the infamous McAfee Knob. There is rain in the forecast, but hopefully I get good weather to see this much talked about spot. A bunch of us got an early ride back to the trail-head. It was only a 0.3 mile walk back, but I avoid road walks if at all possible. The area between here and Daleville has a restriction on where hikers are allowed to camp. Either at a shelter or two campsites next to two of the shelters. Not sure why the restrictions exist except that it is a very heavily used area and the authorities are trying to minimize damage. So, I either have a 10.4 mile day or a 16.4 mile day. I am hoping to do a 16.4 mile day so I have a shorter day into town tomorrow. Weather is looking good so far with sunny skies and warmer temps. I am hiking with Gigline, LG and Speck again today. They pull ahead on the uphills again and I usually catch back up again when they take a break. We went thru several stiles and one was a bit narrow. My wide load of a pack almost didn't make it thru that one. We arrived at VA 311 to find a stash of water left for hikers. Woohoo! My filter isn't working quite right, so this is good news for me. I fill up. There are also two porta potties in the parking lot. I passed those up. This is also where the day hikers begin there hike up to the top to see the knob. I see many hikers going up and many coming down and think there is going to be quite a crowd up on top which is a four mile hike. The area has plenty of signs posted, but I still almost took a fire road up instead of the AT. I finally got on track and headed up. There were two shelters on the way up and I bypassed both. I see a deer just off the trail that stops eating to look at me and then just goes back to eating. My presence didn't seem to phase it. About a mile or so from the top I started hearing thunder and seeing dark clouds moving in. Nooooooo!!! I am about two-tenths of a mile from the summit when I meet up with Speck. She said she was going to wait there until the storm passed over as the summit would be a very exposed place to be. I asked where Gigline was and she said he went up ahead. Like me he has the bad fortune of seeing most of the favorite places he has visited along the AT in bad weather. LG is still a bit behind me. I decide to wait with Speck. The rain starts coming down and we duck under a convenient rock ledge to stay dry. Several day hikers duck under as well. Gigline shows up fighting with his bright yellow poncho, but unfortunately didn't make it to see the top before the storm hit. We are all on our phones trying to get a weather report and Speck has a friend giving her weather updates via text. Speck receives a text from LG saying his lunch isn't agreeing with him and will make it shortly. The storm seems to be moving fast, but we just have to wait it out. Speck and I are staying nice and dry while some others aren't as lucky. I'm sure glad I listened to her and stayed there with her. LG finally arrives and seems to be feeling better and ducks under with us. There is much laughter to be had and we all give Gigline a hard time (it's that bright yellow poncho) and continue to wait. There is a young boy with us about 10 or so under the ledge with us. He was talking about being stuck in the rain and we remind him he will have a great adventure to talk about when he gets home. Who else in his class will have a tale of being stuck just below McAfee Knob with four stinky backpackers. He laughed. He seems like a very nice young man and was enjoying his hike up to this point. Finally the storm abates and we load up and move out. We continue the short distance to the top. Not only have the dark clouds disappeared, so have all the people. We have it all to ourselves!!! I just drop my pack and try to take it all in. I am here!!   I have hiked 712 total AT miles to get here! I am loving life. We all do the picture thing and just enjoy the views. We finally load up and start down. It's less then a mile to the shelter and I've decided to take this option as it's a little late for me to make it the additional 6 miles to the next shelter. I really wish there was a place half way between these two shelters, but it is what it is. More rain is predicted for the evening. The others debate and end up staying at this shelter as well. There is much laughter had. I don't know why, but stuff that is just not funny elsewhere is hilarious out here. We had a small fire, ate dinner and hung out. Two young women are doing an overnighter close by and came by for a short visit.   I tried the never stop method of mountain climbing today and I do feel like it was easier in the long run. I was moving really slow at times, but I just kept moving forward. I don't know if I got up the mountain any quicker, but maybe I will get faster over time. LG said two months, I gave him a dirty look. I chose to sleep in the shelter with the others to get a quicker start to the day tomorrow.   What a great adventure I am on! I feel blessed.","Four Pines Hiker Hostel

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561355,"It was just the four of us in the shelter last night and we all wanted to get an early start, so Speck set her alarm for 5:45. We were all up and on the trail by 6:45. I got a few yards down the trail when I realized that I had put my first aid kit on a shelf in the shelter and didn't remember packing it. I checked and didn't see it in my pack. I ran back up to the shelter and retrieved it. It's one of the reasons I like to stay in my tent, I am much more organized and don't leave things behind. If I lose something, it's almost always at a shelter or hostel. I did wake up a bit sore in the quads this morning and my legs just feel a bit fatigued? over all. Luckily there is just one uphill of 800 ft up to Tinker Cliffs today, then mostly down into town. It's never all down or all up. The climb up seemed pretty steep in spots and I had a tough time with it, but I just kept moving. I felt like I had no energy at all, but I made it to the top without eating my last Snickers bar. I try to save my daily Snickers bar for the last climb/push of the day. That jolt of sugar helps give me a little push. There is rain in the forecast for later this afternoon, but we have a sunny, warm morning to enjoy the views from Tinkers Cliff. The views are amazing, some of the best I've enjoyed so far on the trail. To the west are mountains as far as the eye can see and to the east incredible views of what I think is the James River. Everything looks so peaceful and serene, fills so soul with goodness just to take it in. If I didn't have so many miles to hike today, I could have stayed here for hours. Made it to Lambert Meadows Shelter where I found the others. Speck was on her way out as she wants to get to town sooner rather then later. We all say goodbye and she takes off. It was a true pleasure getting to know her the past couple of days. She is a tremendous hiker and person. (Good luck on your John Muir hike later this year!). It is a very warm day today and we all fill up with water. My filter has all but quit, so LG let's me use his Sawyer. It's a very nice filter that I really like, much faster then my current gravity one. Well anything is faster then mine right now, it is barely dripping. The others head out before me and a hiker that tented near the shelter last night stops by. I say hello and ask if he is a thru-hiker. He said yes and this is his third thru-hike. I was like awesome. He seemed a bit down and said he hadn't seen any thru-hiker, only section hikers, since Pearisburg. I let him know quite a few had stayed at this shelter last night and we're headed to town and quite a few were a day behind him as they zeroed at Four Pines yesterday. He said good, maybe he'd catch some in town and that he didn't like hanging with section hikers. Wow. I've never experienced that attitude before. We all have bad days, hopefully that was the case with him. I didn't say much else, just good luck and hiked on. I saw awesome view after awesome view today until I turned one last time on the trail and saw a cement factory down below, I am obviously getting closer to town. The temperature has to be close to 80 today and I'm loving it. I so enjoy the warmer weather more then when it is colder. However, I think I'm the only one that feels that way. We are about a mile or so out of town and I pull out my last Snickers for the last push. LG said he just ate his and Gigline asked if I was going to share. Of course! It was a bit melted and gooey, but it gave us both a bit of energy to get to town.We are almost to town when all of us run out of water. With the warmer temperatures, we really sucked down the water today. As we step out of the woods, we are on the edge of a very busy four lane road. Man was that an assault to the senses! I can't even describe it, but it was harsh. It was a bit hard to get across and running across with a full pack was not fun at all. We stopped at a little store and Gigline treated us to a Gatorade. It felt wonderful to suck that down. We arrived at the hotel checked in and made plans to meet for dinner. They had to go pick up LGs car at Cross Creek and I needed to do laundry and take a very long, hot shower. They treated me to a wonderful dinner at a little Italian place. I probably should have treated them after all they've done for me the past couple of days. I ordered lasagna and it was seriously delicious. Thanks LG and Gigline for a wonderful dinner.

I am still feeling very fatigued. Oh well, there are things to do and relaxing will have to wait. I start pulling stuff from my pack. My tent is still a little damp, so I set it up in the corner of the room. Pull everything else out to let it air out and clean it if necessary. My room always looks like a pack explosion while I'm in town. I met LG and Gigline downstairs for breakfast for a final meal together. LG gave me a bag full of trail snacks, tuna and a couple of bottles of Gatorade. Gigline also gave me some snacks he had as well. These guys just keep on giving. I finally say goodbye as they are headed out today. I can't say enough good things about these two. Wonderful, wonderful people! All my town chores can be accomplished in one general location about a half mile down the road.   I wish Daleville had some sidewalks, I'm not fond of crossing and walking along this busy street. It has wide shoulders, but sidewalks and crosswalks would be nice. They do have a warning sign to let motorist know that backpackers are about, but some of the motorist seem oblivious. It's raining a bit, but things have to get done.   First I go to the UPS store and ship some stuff home. The woman waiting on me is just awesome and my stuff is on the way to Mark. I then go to the outfitters for a few items. I'm the only customer in the store and the two guys working are very helpful as I can't seem to find anything I'm looking to buy. Finally, I just tell them what I want and they retrieve it. They were very patient with me as my brain seemed to be missing. I wanted to get something to carry my phone more securely. I have been carrying it in my side cargo pocket and one fall could take it out. I've already dropped it once and cracked the protective case I have it in. Mark is also going to order me a better case and send it to me in a future maildrop. They give me numerous options and I select a osprey pouch thing that will not only hold my phone, but also my iPod and snacks. I'd probably use my iPod a bit more if it was more convenient to pull out. I also bought a new Sawyer filter (I really liked LGs), a buff (I lost mine somewhere), a new tip for my hiking pole (I lost one somewhere around Dragon's Tooth) and a pair of shorts and shirt to sleep in since I sent my long johns home.Last stop is Kroger's for snacks and lunches as well as some snacks for the room. I obviously don't have my Kroger card with me, but when I ask the cashier uses a store card for me and saves me quite a few dollars. Finally, I'm done spending money. I was going to stop at The Three Lil' Pigs BBQ, but I'm just to exhausted. I decide to just lug all my purchases back to my room and take a nap. I talk to Mark again and decide to take another zero. The forecast is calling for 1 to 2 inches of rain tomorrow as well as another 1 to 2 tomorrow evening. I am also not feeling rested. So I leave the repacking and food sorting until tomorrow and just relax. Pizza Hut is right outside my hotel and I go there to pick up a pizza. The large is $6 cheaper then a medium which seems a bit ludicrous to me, but I get a large. I'll eat the leftovers tomorrow. My taste buds seem really out of whack right now and it taste super sweet. Believe me, I ate it anyway. I spent the rest of the evening just relaxing, catching up on some journaling and tried watching a bit of tv. I kept flipping through the channels, not finding anything I wanted to watch. I finally just turned it off and read a book on my phone. I hope I feel normal by tomorrow.","Daleville, VA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561638,"I didn't really hike 12.9 miles today, but my mileage is off and I wanted to fix it. I slept like a log last night and I must have slept on my face. I think the bags under my eyes have bags of there own. I am feeling more myself today. Thank goodness. Instead of the free breakfast downstairs, I walked to Cracker Barrel over in Troutville. The map from the data book shows the way may be closed due to construction. I ask downstairs and she says it would be open to people walking, but cars have to go on quite the detour. I'm also hoping that the traffic along the way will be much lighter on a Sunday morning. I've been thinking about this breakfast since the beginning of the week when I had a discussion with some other hikers at a shelter. Breakfast is my favorite meal when I get to town. I know that LG or Gigline would have driven me over there yesterday if I had asked, but I really didn't feel up to it then. It was a little over a mile to walk over, but the traffic wasn't too bad and once I hit the construction I had the road to myself. So besides having to dodge the cars getting off and on I-81 and a guy making an illegal U-turn, it wasn't too bad. I ordered a lot and enjoyed every bite and I don't even have my hiker appetite yet. An older lady was watching me in amazement, but man did it taste good. Love me some breakfast!I finished putting my food and pack back together. I mostly just chilled today. Rain sure is coming down hard and there are flood warnings all over the area. I'm glad I decided to just stay in town today. It is supposed to rain thru Tuesday, but it is going to let up some. I have noticed something while out on the trail. The gnats love me. I can be sitting with several other hikers and I'm the only one getting bugged by gnats. Not fair!! I googled it yesterday and read that they are attracted to sweet or fruity smells. I guarantee you that after not taking a shower for days that I do not smell sweet or fruity. I stink like every other backpacker out there. The gnats drive me crazy! I bought some bug spray and I will try spraying my hat to see if that helps. If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know. I have plenty of time to think while out on the trail and have decided to change my hike from a flip-flop to a LASH (long ass section hike). I will just hike from Atkins to Mt Katahdin. I will not be a thru-hiker, but I will have hiked every mile of the trail. I am happy about this decision. Of course, I can change my mind once I get to Mt Katahdin, but I started introducing myself as a lasher late in the week and it fit very well. Tonight I'm just going to stay dry, warm and chill. I'm looking forward to heading out tomorrow and hiking this next section even though I will be heading out in the rain. Hike your own hike and enjoy your time in the woods!!","Daleville, VA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561639,"I woke up ready to get out of town. It's still raining and the forecast is calling for rain thru tomorrow afternoon sometime. Luckily the trail-head was right next to the hotel, so no long road walk. Since it's raining, I wanted to stay in a shelter tonight. So I have a choice between 11.2 (too short) miles and 18.5 miles (too long). I'm not sure where I will end up.The trail went from Daleville to Troutville. This included going under I-81 and crossing a couple other roads. It felt like miles went by before I couldn't hear traffic.The trail today was wet and foggy for the most part today. I started out in my t-shirt and rain jacket and was okay. Once I got to a higher elevation, it was more exposed and the wind was pretty fierce. So I stopped at Fullhardt Knob Shelter at 5 miles to put on my fleece and eat a snack. Smokey was there packing up. He is doing 28 miles days, so he will pass me later and I'm sure I'll never see him again. Nice guy, but very focused. I met up with Onion as I was coming out of the shelter. We said hello and hiked on. The weather was not conducive to chatting. I met a slack packer going southbound who warned me to be careful at the stream crossings and to be ready to get my feet wet. I ended up crossing 5 or 6 very fast moving full creeks. I took my time on each one, tried to take smaller steps and made it across all them with out mishap. I did get wet feet.I arrived at Wilson Creek Shelter at the 11.2 mile mark around 1 o'clock. Floater and Onion were there and I got to talk with them a little. They were waiting on the final member of their group. Onion's pack frame is broken and she was working with Osprey on the phone to get it fixed. She will get a brand new pack when she gets to Waynesboro. She was very excited that they were going to replace her pack no questions asked. They really seemed to be enjoying their hike. It was too early to stop, so I decided to hike on and try to go the 18.2 miles. I crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway 3 times I think. Each crossing had a view, but they were all socked in with fog. Each had a trashcan. I didn't have much trash since I just left town, but I did drop off a few wrappers. The trail pretty much just followed the parkway after I crossed it the first time. I arrived at the Bobletts Gap Shelter about 4:30. Nemo and Spiderman were here. Nemo was debating with himself on whether to go or stay. Spiderman was already settled in. I set up a spot, got water, ate and snuggled in. Nemo ended up staying as well. Another hiker showed up and I said hi, I'm SunSeeker. He said I know you!!! It's LoneStar from the San Antonio Backpacking Meetup Group. We were a couple of the first members of the Meetup Group. We did a couple trips together when I lived in Texas. What a small world. He is out doing a section hike. Short day planned for tomorrow and I'm hoping the weather clears up soon. Nonstop rain sucks.","Daleville, VA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562119,"We didn't have anybody else show up at the shelter last night. LoneStar thought that more would show up, but it was just the four of us. It rained pretty much all night and continues this morning. I found out later that the shelter before ours was packed and had tents around it as well.I was pretty down this morning. There is a reason that my name is SunSeeker. Endless rain really wears on me and it makes me question why I'm out here. I've only been hiking in rain for two days and the forecast is for sunny weather tomorrow. I sure hope so. I was really dreading putting on wet clothes. I did as much as possible from my sleeping bag and changed at the last possible moment. I was ready to walk within 10 minutes of changing clothes. I had to hike up a quarter of a mile to get back to the AT and that warmed me up. It was raining and foggy most of the day, but the rain wasn't as hard as yesterday. At times the trail became a creek itself, but not for super long stretches. I crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway a couple more times, but still no views, just fog. The wind was pretty cold when exposed on a ridge then I'd warm up when I was in a more sheltered part of the trail. I stopped at the first shelter for an early lunch and Nemo was there trying to decide his days agenda. I hung around till I started to get chilled and as I was walking away up walked LoneStar. Nemo told him a campground was in 3 miles that he could call for a shuttle. They had laundry facilities and a grill. The two of them decided to go to the campground as LoneStar's sleeping bag is a little damp from last night. I hiked and talked with LoneStar for the next 3 miles. It was really nice to catch up with him some more. I still think it's pretty wild that I saw him out in the middle of nowhere. The road had a bridge that had a raging creek. I'm so glad there was a bridge as I don't think I could have crossed that one. It would have definitely swept me away.When we got to the road, I continued hiking while they went to the campground. They still planned on making the next shelter where I planned to stay. It was just another 4 miles or so to the shelter and it continues to rain. I was hoping it would stop raining earlier so I could walk my hiking clothes dry. No such luck. Everything is still wet. I didn't have to cross any swollen streams until right before the shelter. So nice wet feet as well.When I arrived at the shelter, there was a pack here, but no owner. About a half hour after I got here, Onion and Floaters friend showed up. Sounds like Onion has injured a tendon or something in her foot and he helped her get to the campground to get shuttled to a hospital. I hope she is okay. Always hard when you hear of someone getting injured. He didn't stay but hiked on.This shelter sleeps twenty and there are quite a few hikers here tonight. Bird and Farley are here and have wet stuff strung up all over. Their sleeping bags and just about everything else they have is wet. Smoky showed up and he had to go to the campground to dry everything out as his pack ended up in one of the creeks. Everyone is looking forward to the sun coming out tomorrow. Tomorrow is a tough hike as there is a very long ascent tomorrow of around 3,000 feet. Oh joy. Not!","Bobletts Gap Shelter

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562120,"I knew I had a hard day ahead of me with several long hard climbs. I woke promptly at 6 and was on the trail by 7. As the sky became visible, I could tell it was going to be a beautiful day. I was very much looking forward to a sunny, warm day. The day's hike started by going straight up Floyd Mountain with about a 2,300 ft ascent. It really was a beautiful morning. I came upon 3 deer just standing in the trail. They don't seem to concerned about me when I'm by myself. As I drew closer they finally took off into the woods. As I climbed higher in elevation I noticed the trees have not completely leafed out. I was passed by Bird and Farley fairly early in the climb. I stopped at a campsite to take off my fleece and use the tree facilities, then started hiking again. I was passed by Bird and Farley again. I must have looked confused because they told me they had to get water. They didn't want to carry much up the first hill. Nemo soon passed just as we approached the first shelter. He ducked into the shelter and I continued the climb. Just past the top of Floyd there was a sign pointing to an overlook. I went to check it out and to have a snack. The sun was shining brightly and I stayed there awhile soaking up some rays.The next mountain in my path today was Apple Orchard Mountain with an additional 1,200 ft climb. I met a man having a picnic up there just enjoying the day. We chatted for awhile and I continued on. At the top was what looked like a Doppler radar thing, but is listed in the guide as a Federal Aviation Admin tower. I then got to go down hill for a bit and encountered a rocky downhill section. I really could have used a nice gentle downhill section. But No!! Among the boulders and rocks is the Guillotine. A huge rock is wedged between two boulders which could fall someday. It looks wedged in there pretty good. LoneStar came up on me as we were approaching the second shelter of the day. We both needed? water and lunch so we ducked in there. Nemo was there having lunch as well. LoneStar and I went down to get water and it was a boxed in spring. LoneStar stuck his bladder down in the box to fill it up and a frog jumped up on the bladder. Too funny. He didn't want to get off either, but he was eventually persuaded to get off. We had lunch and continued on up the trail. We passed the Blue Ridge parkway again and came up on the Thunder Ridge Overlook. An older couple were there and they pointed out everything we were seeing. Very nice. They also let us know that there was a trash can in the parking lot. Sweet! The trail went down for a bit here, then up a bit and then down a bit. Pretty harmless, just miles to cover. I had some nice views and went thru a huge patch of trillium. Those flowers are so pretty. Then came Highcock Knob, the last climb of the day. It was only 800 ft but it went straight up for what seemed forever. I really struggled with this last hill. I passed two guys about a quarter of a mile from the top. They said they were camping the same place I was, so I just said see you there and continued up. It was listed as just a wooded summit, but it was actually quite pretty. I was tired though, so just started down the other side. Why the trail goes up to the very tippy top, just to go down the other side is beyond me. The descent was as steep as the ascent. Finally made it to the tent site. JD arrived shortly after we did. He was at our shelter last night. He thought the climbs were not too bad. To be 19 again. Lol. We all had dinner together and now tucked into our tents. Hiker midnight is upon us.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562413,"I had a choice today of doing 9.3 miles or 18.2 miles with most of the last 9 miles climbing a cumulative 3000 ft.  When I went to bed last night I was going to do the 18.2 with LoneStar.  I woke up about 3 and debated with myself about the mileage.  I decided to take an easy day today and tackle the 3000 ft elevation climb when I'm fresher tomorrow.  My feet are feeling the long days and I don't want to overdo it to fast.  I enjoyed hiking with him, but I'm trying to be smart for me. I went outside my tent around 3 as well to find a tree and I must say the stars were out of this world. Absolutely gorgeous.  I just stood there in awe for awhile, but eventually crawled back into my tent.LoneStar's alarm went off at 5.  He needs two cups of coffee in the morning and two hours to pack up. He wanted to be out by 7.  I crawled out shortly after his alarm and let him know my change of plans and just chat for awhile.  He was out just before 7.Since I only have a little over 9 miles to go, I was planning on a late start, because it is mostly downhill for me today.  I managed a 8:15 departure time.  I'm not any good at just sitting around camp in the morning. Oh well, I will hike slowly today.I had some views of where I've been hiking.  The early morning views had me above the fog.  So I was hiking down into the fog versus hiking up into the clouds today.  I took more time to enjoy the flowers around me and just enjoy the day more then I have been.  The wildflowers are just magnificent this time of year.  I passed a trail named Devil's Marbleyard.  I don't know what that trail has in store for a hiker, but it just has to be worse then the trail coming off Dragon Tooth.  I will need to Google it when I get to town.I had to ford a few streams today, but was able to keep my feet and boots dry. Thank goodness. I am finally getting everything dry from the rain earlier in the day.  I did see some waterfalls coming right down by the trail.  I don't know if they are normally there or just there due to all the rain.  I stopped for a break at the first shelter of the day for a snack.  It is right on Matt's Creek and the shelter had a flash floods warning sign. It looked high enough to stay dry from this past storm which is good because the AT crosses the creek and there is no bridge. There were a lot of butterflies and huge bees buzzing around the shelter, but they left me alone. I hike further down into the valley and things got a little wetter.  I saw a large group of butterflies hanging out on a rock. They were very pretty.  I walked along Matt's Creek for quite awhile and then saw the James River.  I would eventually wind my way down to it.  I saw a turtle in the middle of the trail and stopped to takes it's picture.  He blended in to the trail pretty good.  He should move before he gets stomped on. I started walking along the James River for about a mile of so until I came to the longest footbridge on the trail.  It allowed me to cross this large fast moving river safely.  Very cool bridge.  I went thru two parking lots just on the other side of the bridge, but no trash cans today.  Darn.  Not that I have accumulated much trash since yesterday, but still. Some type of fighter jets were doing manuevers today.  They wouls come roaring over the mountains, make a hard U-turn at the river and then roar back over the mountains. It was like they were using the river for third base or something. I made it to the campsite quite early.  I wish there had been a campsite or shelter somewhere between here and the next shelter, but I don't want to push my feet to 18 miles today.  So here I'll stay.  I rigged a clothes line and hung everything up to dry out. My sleeping bag and other stuff is all a bit damp.  I talked to Nemo, Farley, Bird and Kiwi when they came through. Everyone is headed to that next shelter high in the mountains.  Made me want to go, but I stayed put.  The two section hikers that stayed with us last night were supposed to come here for the night, but I got the feeling they have bailed on their hike. It was pretty hot today and there is rain in the overnight forecast.  I'm set up in the shelter and will read for awhile.  There are thunderstorms in the forecast this evening and tonight.  It was another reason I didn't hike up the mountain today.  It looks like the trail follows the ridgeline at the top and I didn't want to get caught up that high with lighten flashing about.  It is still early and the sky is getting pretty dark. I think I will fix dinner early just in case. Tomorrow is supposed to be another sunny and warm day.  I hope to get an early start to knock out this next climb.  It is the last huge climb before I hit Buena Vista, my next trail town.  It is about 20 miles away and I have numerous options tomorrow for camping for the night and then hike into town Saturday.  I am ready for a shower, laundry and some town food.","Marble Springs Tent Site

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563230,"My shuttle driver was not kidding when she said my second day was going to be tough.  If I had known how tough the climb up Three Ridges Mountain was going to be, I would have made the effort to get up The Priest Mountain yesterday. I woke up and the wind was still howling.  I was hoping to go up and see the sunrise from Spy Rock, but the wind was making it way too cold.  I packed up and started up Priest Mountain. The climb didn't seem too bad and I arrived at the junction for the shelter about 9 AM. I misread the sign and continued on the AT instead of going to the shelter. Since I had made a dry camp last night, I would need water soon. I meant to stop at Priest Shelter to get water, but there was a stream in about 3 miles and I wasn't going to backtrack to the shelter.  On the way down Priest, I found a wonderful large rock crop sitting in the sun out of the wind.  I took a break here for a snack and just soak in some sunshine.  I saw quite a few day hikers going south. There was one large group of about 12 seniors climbing up doing quite a nice job at getting up the mountain. The last man in the line stopped and gave me a frozen Snickers bar.  I thanked him and told him it would help me up the other side.It took a lot longer to get down Priest then I thought it would, but eventually I made it down to the pedestrian suspension bridge crossing the Tye River.  Now to start the 6 mile 3,000 ft ascent of Three Ridges.  It was 2.4 miles to a shelter where I planned to take a break. Just before the shelter, there was a short downhill and I took this opportunity to eat my Snickers.  I was barely moving and had my poles tucked under my arm while I enjoyed my candy bar.  I heard a noise up to my left and there was a bear.  I ate my bar a little faster, but before I could finish and get my camera out, he saw me and took off up the hill.  Great sighting!!  The shelter was off the trail quite a bit, so I decided to hike on. The miles were coming slowly today.  I climbed and I climbed and crossed huge boulder fields like the picture above. It felt like it was taking forever to climb this mountain. There were so many rocks and boulders that it seriously slowed my progress.  It became a day of just getting the miles over.  I saw more day hikers headed south.  When I said the climb was kicking my butt, they said it was going to continue to kick my butt. Humph. I started to see a huge mountain beyond the summit I was trying to climb and I just knew I was going over that.  I saw two more South bounders and asked if I was going up there. They said why yes you are. There was nothing I could do but continue putting one foot in front of the other.  On a good note, the wind had stopped sometime during this climb. There were many switchbacks and I continued to climb. There were some nice views, but I was starting to get worried about time and didn't stop to enjoy them more then a few seconds.  Eventually I hit the summit.  According to my shuttle driver this is the last mountain above 4,000 ft we will climb until Massachusetts.  That doesn't mean there aren't big climbs though, just means that might start lower and not go quite to 4,000 ft.It was still 3 miles to the shelter I wanted to spend the night.  I started down the other side.  It was about 6 PM by the time I made the shelter.  There were 3 section hikers already there: FireWatcher, TalkingBull and Major.  We were soon joined by Wolverine, a young thru-hiker.  FireWatcher had a nice fire going to eat dinner by and for some lively conversation. Great group of guys to spend the evening with after the very long hiking day.","Spy Rock

Wolverine was headed the 21 miles to town, while the rest of us are headed for the next shelter about 5 miles before town.  We were all up and out of the shelter by 7AM.  It was overcast and the wind was back.  The sky looked like rain all day.  I hiked with the 3 section hikers for a little while. It is nice to have someone to talk to once in awhile.  They stopped to get water, but I had plenty and continued to hike.  I crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway a couple times and one had a trash can, so I stopped to dump my trash.  There were several views again today, but the wind continued to blow like crazy and made hanging around the overlooks a little chilly.  No lingering for me today.I had one climb of about 1,000 ft and once again there were lots of rocks, ledges and boulder fields.  The climb was a little tough today as my legs are feeling a little fatigued from yesterday, but like everyday I reached the top by putting one foot in front of the other.  I started down the other side and finally ducked out of the wind.  Thank goodness.  I passed two ladies going up to camp on the top and I advised them not to go up there with the wind and the predicted rain.  TalkingBull said they decided not to go to the top and were looking for a spot below the summit.I reached the shelter pretty early and before the rain. It made me quite happy to not get wet today.  I won't have to put on wet clothes tomorrow morning.  Some slack packer showed up for a short break and then took off again.  FireWatcher and his crew showed up a short time later and before the rains started.  They were happy about that.  The rains have started and I am under a metal roof.  Three inches are predicted overnight and I'm happy to be in the shelter tonight.  I will be hiking into town tomorrow in the rain.  There is a graduation of some kind this weekend and all the hotels have jacked there prices up to the $180 range.

Between the metal roof and the roaring of the rapidly rising creek, the decibel level in the shelter was kind of high.  It was a nice shelter with a large porch and I stayed quite dry.  All the noise drowned all the hiker noise and I slept pretty good for being in a shelter.  Everyone was happy that the shelter was North of Mill Creek.  Yesterday it was a nice little rock hop across, this morning no rocks were even visible. I would not want to cross it this morning. I hiked out with TalkingBull and his group.  It was a five mile hike to Rockfish Gap and Waynesboro, VA.  The rain had mostly stopped as we headed up the trail.  We had to cross many streams with some going mid calf.  Feet and boots are soaked!  Once the boots get soaked through, I no longer care as my boots were already as wet as they can get.  The trail had turned into a creek itself in many places.  We were at the trailhead by 9:15.  A guy showed up quickly and drove me to the hostel.  This is one of the nicest hostels I have ever stayed.  I jumped promptly into the shower and did my laundry in record time!  Awesome.  Then a group of us were promptly taken to the outfitters and post office.  I've never seen a hostel run so smoothly.  When I returned, I was dropped at E&J pub for lunch.  I had a very good burger and fries.  I was still hungry so I ordered a 1/2 pound of shrimp with coleslaw.  The other patrons sitting at the bar with me were giving me some strange looks, but I was hungry!  I walked across the street to Kroger for some snacks and walked the half mile back to the hostel.I spent some time on the phone with Mark, my favorite town activity!  The rest of the afternoon was spent talking with the other 3 hikers here, soaking my feet in some Epson salt and preparing for the next hiking section.  I went to dinner with the other hikers, but I ate a normal size dinner.  Haha.  I'm excited to be entering Shenandoah tomorrow.  It is just over 100 miles and the other hikers are trying to get through in five days.  I'm still quite a bit slower and will take 7 to 8 days to get through. ","Paul Wolfe Shelter

It was raining, extremely windy and cold when I finally arrived at the trailhead.  I'm telling you, if the shuttle driver hadn't taken off so fast, I would have been back in the car and headed back to the hostel.  I saw a group just starting a trip into the park who bailed as soon as they felt the wind, rain and cold.   I put on my rain jacket and headed into the woods.  Once I got into the woods, the trees blocked some of the wind and I warmed up.  The meadows and mountain top views I normally like were my least favorite part today.  The wind was crazy and tried to steal my hat several times.  I passed a couple communication towers and a couple roads.  The trail was fairly easy today with some ups and downs, but nothing to extreme.  If the weather was sunny and warm I would have enjoyed the hike very much.  However, with all the rain the area has had recently, the trail has turned into a muddy mess in many locations and into an actual creek in a couple. I did have a few sections like the picture above that depict the trail as the long green tunnel.  The trees are almost all leafed out now. With less then 8 miles, I hiked a leisurely pace and tried to enjoy the day.  Wolverine passed me, headed to the same shelter.  I saw one guy hiking south and one guy out for a trail run.  I arrived at the shelter and several hikers were already there.  As the night wore on, more and more showed up. It's crazy. The shelter is full with many tents and hammocks set up all around.  There are 3 thru-hikers and  many short section hikers.  I am amazed at how crowded it is.  I hope this isn't an indication of how crowded the huts are all week.  After this shelter, they are called huts thru the Shenandoah's.  I've enjoyed interacting with all the people around the fire, but when I started to get chilly it was time to crawl in my bag and write my journal.  I hope to get an early start tomorrow.","Stanimal's 328 Hostel

It was only 28 degrees and I had a really hard time getting out of the warm feathers that surrounded me. I finally managed to get up and had a couple deer in my campsite while I packed up.  They didn't seem to even notice that they were so close to me. My campsite in the campground was mere feet from the trail and I was headed north in no time.  There were several great views as the trail walked around the campground, but it was to cold to stand around very long. I walked about 3 miles or so and took another side trail to get back to the wayside for a hot breakfast of bacon and eggs.  I love breakfast and yes, I walked an extra mile off trail to get some. I weighed myself at Stanimals and the scale said I lost 15 pounds already. I don't know how accurate the scale was, but everyone else thought it was saying they weighed too much.  I'm trying to take advantage of the waysides to get some calories in me. The whole side trip took about 45 minutes of my day.The hike down to and back up from Ivy Springs was very muddy and wet.  There was even a nice waterfall right on the trail.  I climbed up to the Ivy Creek Overlook to a parking lot with a nice view.  The sun was out and I sat on the rock wall enjoying the view and soaking up some rays.  It still wasn't super warm as I hiked all day with my fleece, but I'll take what I can get.  KJ walked up and joined me for a spell until we decided we needed to get walking.  I was in no rush today knowing I only had 15 miles to do.  I took my time and walked a slow steady pace all day.  I could tell the weekend was over, because I didn't see many day hikers out today.  I didn't see many backpackers while walking either.  I did see the most beautiful blue bird, a indigo bunting maybe.  Simply gorgeous!I was walking on a very nice flat piece of trail with no rocks or roots.  I was looking around and next thing I know I was laying stretched out on the trail. I never did figure out what I tripped over.  HahaI climbed up another mountain and found another sunny rock outcrop with a nice view.  I stopped there for another extended break and up walks KJ again.  I really like sunny rocks with views.  We had about 3 miles to go to the hut as we headed out.  He took off and I kept my slow and steady pace.  The last couple of climbs had some really steep sections, but they didn't last long.  I arrived at the hut to find many hikers already here.  I always wonder why I never see them during the day.  There is a mix of short and long section hikers and thru-hikers.  I love the short section hikers because they like to make fires.  Always nice.  While we were sitting there up walked Steaks, a section hiker I met Saturday night out on his first trip.  Super nice guy.  KJ and I tried to figure out what to hike tomorrow, but came to no conclusion. The first hut is in 12 miles and then Big Meadows is at 20 miles.  To stealth anywhere between the two means lugging water from the hut at 12.  Quite the decision to be made tomorrow.","Loft Mountain Campground

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564035,"I woke up at 5 AM a bit uncomfortable. Not cold exactly, but not toasty either.  Since I was in my tent and wouldn't disturb anybody in the shelter, I got up and packed for the day.  It is now light enough by six to see and that's when I headed out.  Steaks read that sunrise would be really nice on the summit above the shelter, but I was a bit too late and didn't find the spot to watch it from anyway.  The climb up there helped get the blood pumping and warmed me right up.  I did see a couple nice overviews up there, but not where I'd see the sunrise.  It was too cold to linger so I headed back down the other side of the summit.  Within minutes of starting my descent I saw a Barred Owl on a branch right over the trail. It was awesome to see.  He took off when I was just about under him and landed a few trees away.  He just sat there watching my approach and when I got too close took off again.  Although I've heard owls out here, this is the first time I've seen one.  Shortly after that I saw a bear running away from me.  I also saw many deer this morning as well.  I think I like getting on the trail early. The only downside is the first one on the trail in the morning has spider web patrol.  They aren't too bad yet, but I hit a few.  I met some bird watchers today and I described 3 birds, besides the owl, that I saw this morning.  They said I saw an indigo bunting (blue), scarlet tangier (red) and a goldfinch (yellow).  I had a colorful morning. Of course, I saw plenty of other little birds, but those 3 seemed special.  The bird watchers seemed a bit jealous of my sightings.  The trail seemed to parallel Skyline Drive a lot today and I heard traffic most of the day.  Even though the AT doesn't seem to be going to any of the special things that are in the park, I still enjoyed the day's hike.  The woods on either side of the trail today was covered in many different wildflowers.  My favorite is the trilliums.  I met an elderly couple towards the end of the day trying to identify some of the flowers we were seeing.  They had a guide and I hung out with them for awhile trying to identify them.  We did not identify any, but I sure enjoyed their company. I stopped at Lewis Mountain Campsite for lunch and to fill up on water.  It was still quite chilly and I didn't linger too long.  As I was leaving, I saw Lioness and she was the only person from last night I saw.  I saw several day hikers out and about, but no other backpackers.  I started getting tired around mile 18, but I could hear the shower calling my name.  I arrived at the Big Meadows Campground about 5:15 PM and completed my first 20 mile day.  The registration desk was manned and the ranger made the process simple.  Usually they make you go pick a site and come back, but he just gave me a great site off the bat.  Thank goodness.  I didn't want to be walking around anymore.  I set up camp, took a wonderful hot shower, did laundry and ate dinner.  I have been carrying a trail size shampoo and one of those tide pods all week just for today.  I have started eating more and I'm out of stuff for lunch and daily snacks.  The wayside opens at 8 AM tomorrow and I'll be able to resupply for the 3 days that it will take me to reach Front Royal.  Tomorrow is the last nice day weather wise.  The rest of the week, they are predicting rain.  I hope it warms up a bit though.

I met a couple that were out enjoying the birdsong, but they didn't know the names of the other birds I saw.  All the birds are really making my days out here.  I saw many day hikers out today. One couple had to have been in their late ninety's and they were going up mountains with no problem.  However, they did stop and check their blood pressure at the top saying they had to keep track of their numbers.  They weren't even breathing hard and their numbers were good.  What an inspiration to me.  There were many views today as the trail took us around the town of Luray.  I saw the same view just a little bit further north each time.  One spot called the cliffs was my favorite. Sunny out crops of rock always make me happy and this one had a fabulous view of the town.  I made it into Bryds Nest about 6 PM just behind Towelie and just before KJ.  We had dinner together and as we were finishing up a bear just walks up out of the woods.  Took some direct action on our part to get him to leave, but he came back.  Towelie ran him off again, but we are all wondering if he will be back.Steaks just showed up, so it is the four of us tonight and due to the bear and predicted rain, we are all in the shelter.  It's the first shelter in the Shenandoahs that hasn't been packed maybe because everyone else knew about the resident bear.  The mice are pretty active already as well.

It is a very nice shelter with a view of the town below.  We could see the lights from below and would have had a nice view of the sunset if it wasn't so cloudy.The rains started around midnight and we had a loud thunderstorm come in for awhile.  We were up and packing by 6 AM and I was out of the shelter about 7.  It was not raining when I started out and I got one nice view with fog covering the valleys below, but soon after that it was socked in everywhere.  The rains started and I was soon just putting in the days miles.  I entertained myself as I walked the miles and enjoyed the morning even with the poor weather.  There was one last wayside in the park that we all planned to go to for lunch.  It was the closest one to the trail at only 0.1 miles off trail.  When I got there I saw Bri and Sitting Bull again.  They were getting a shuttle to a hostel in Front Royal.  I ordered a cheeseburger, fries and hot tea and asked where could I eat it.  They said outside.  They would not let anyone eat inside, so I sat under an awning between two buildings which made a nice wind tunnel.  I was wet and cold, but needed to eat.  I talked with Bri and Sitting Bull while I ate.  Surly showed up, but he's pretty quiet.  As I was finishing Steaks arrived.  He had tweaked his ankle and had decided to cut his trip a day short.  I don't blame him at all and think he rocked his first ever trip.  KJ and Towelie arrived as I was leaving.  I was getting too cold and needed to get moving.  I've never been happier to encounter a mountain that needed to be climbed.  I was soon warm again and the rain had let up.  I had less then 6 miles to get to the shelter and a long 6 miles it was.  The sky opened up when I was about a half mile from the shelter soaking me thru once again.  There were three hikers here when I got there. A south bounder who has pretty much stayed wrapped up in his sleeping bag and two weekenders, Nick and Ted.  I can't believe they didn't postpone their trip with this weather, but they said it is hard to get it on the schedule.  While I was setting up my spot Towelie arrived cold and wet.  He has decided to set up his tent saying he sleeps better in it.  KJ arrived a short time later.  Jukebox has also joined us.  It is early, but everyone is wrapped up in their sleeping bags and quiet.  Tomorrow I will be leaving Shenandoah and headed to a hostel.  The weather will be like it was when I arrived: raining, cold and windy.  I had some awesome days in the middle though.  I was going to get a room in Front Royal, but once again I have arrived in a town when something is going on and all the rooms are booked.  Not sure what I'll do yet, but I will adapt.  I hope there is room in the hostel.  I called and tried to make a reservation from Waynesboro, but he said it wasn't necessary.  Hopefully, the weather doesn't have it already booked.","Bryds Nest #3

I've not seen one actually move, they just hang out on the trail. I had a bit of trouble finding the turn off for the hostel.  The directions in the book say turn at the Compton Gap Trail, but the sign post said Chester Gap Trail.  It did say it was the last cement post in the park; however, I didn't know it was the last sign post until I reached the end of the park.  I pulled out GutHook and it said I went 0.2 miles to far.  Ugh!  I backtracked and went down the Chester Gap Trail.  It was a half mile walk down that trail that I will have to retrace tomorrow.  I will admit that the Shenandoah cement post with mileage information will be missed as I leave the park.  They even pointed out which way was North and South on the AT.  I arrived at the shelter and Bluebell and Slider were the only other hikers here.  Slider gave me the tour just like he did in Waynesboro.  His long section is complete and he is headed home tomorrow.  The hostel is okay except it isn't near any restaurants.  The owner is taking us to eat at 7 in case any other hikers show up that want to go with us.  We do get a free soda and a personal size pizza as part of the cost of the stay, but that pizza didn't stay with me long.  I did have a long, hot shower and did my laundry.  I was able to find a room in town for tomorrow night.  It isn't anything fancy, but I will be closer to some restaurants and allow me to have a little down time.  Mike, the hostel owner, took us into town at 7 PM to eat.  We went to the PaveMint Bar and Grill.  Great food and had a large beer selection.  Being a Friday night it was very busy.  There wasn't much seating and we were sat at a large table with other people.  There were other hikers at the table and I was able to see KJ and Shoelace again.  I met Shoelace at Stanimals and didn't think I'd see him again.  Fun to catch up with him.","Gravel Springs Hut

I bought stuff to have breakfast in the room, but was still hungry.  I found a diner about a half mile away and went there for a second breakfast.  I had three eggs, bacon, sausage, fried potatoes and toast for just over 5 bucks.  Works for me. Lol. I went back to the room and had one more phone call with Mark and finally checked out at 11.  Called a taxi for a ride back to the trailhead and he was there in less then 5 minutes. The taxis in Front Royal are awesome. I had the same driver I had on Saturday and I tipped him well this time. On Saturday, I hardly had the cash to pay him, but went to the ATM yesterday.  He was a very nice guy.  I met up with Packman and MoonWalker at the trailhead.  I had met them at a hut in the Shenandoahs and they were waiting for a shuttle to their car.  We talked for awhile and then I headed up the trail.  The trail was very muddy in spots today.  In some spots it was a creek running  down the middle of the trail.  I have to slow down in these spots since I tend to slip and slide a lot.  Some places the mud tried to suck the boots right off my feet.  I hiked for the first time in shorts and I will need to get some gaters.  I kept getting pebbles in my shoes.  Not fun. I was definitely hiking thru the long green tunnel for most of the day.  I'm not seeing as many wildflowers, but still saw some.  The highlight of the day for me was hiking thru a meadow on top of a ridge.  There was a bench in the sun up there that was calling my name.  It had a nice open view and I took an extended break.  I emptied the pebbles from my shoes, had a snack and just soaked up the sun. It was windy, but since the temperature was in the 70, I didn't mind it. What a difference the temperature makes when it comes to liking the wind or not.   It was really the only view of the day.  I walked under I66 and listened to that traffic for a ways.  It is always a bit jarring to my senses.  Being a beautiful Sunday afternoon, I saw many day hikers out enjoying the day.  Some want to talk and others just go on there way.  One guy tried to run me off the trail twice.  I was going uphill, so I have the right away.  He was not having it and just about plowed me over.  Then he hit his turn around point and came back.  As soon as I heard him and saw it was him, I just got out of his way.  He was not going to pause for one second. Everyone else was very pleasant.  I only saw 3 backpackers while hiking and they were going southbound.  I arrived at the shelter kind of early and Debbie was setting up.  She is doing a short section and this was her first day.  She is going southbound and when I asked her about stealth sites between here and the next shelter, she said she didn't see any.  I was thinking of trying to go up to the top of this mountain to try and find a spot, but the wind is blowing pretty hard and would be worse up there.  I decided to just stay here.  I had dinner with Debbie and more hikers have come in.  I'm tenting, so if I wake up and want to get an early start I won't desturb anyone.  I went down to the shelter to say hi to the hikers who came in.  They were eating dinner at the picnic table in front. It was only 7:30 and still daylight out, but the mice we're darting everywhere. I've never seen them come out of the shelter and run around by the picnic table while it was still daylight. I'm glad I didn't stay in the shelter. I am feeling good physically.  My feet are doing pretty good. They swell up and ache sometimes, but they don't hurt like they did in 2009.  I'm happy about that.  My big toe that was infected seems to be fine, it goes numb sometimes, but doesn't hurt at all.  The rest of my body seems to be doing okay.  I tried walking faster during the rain last week and it made my shin hurt.  When I went back to my normal gait, it stopped hurting.  If I want to walk faster, I have to increase the rotation and not stretch out my stride.  I want to avoid shin splints that seem to bother so many if I can.  My achilles have been getting tight and I've increased some basic stretches I've been doing and it seems to be helping.  Overall, I am pleased with how I'm doing.  I am trying to listen to my body which is hard to do sometimes when you know there are miles to be hiked.","Front Royal, VA

Today I saw a flower still attached to a small branch in the middle of the trail. It is the flower of the tulip tree.  And now I know.I made it to the campsite that GutHook talked about, but it was dark and muddy and I didn't want to stay there.  I had been seeing lots of campsites along the way and decided to risk finding one a bit ahead that was more pleasing.  I had already filled up with water, so was ready for a dry camping site.  Just 0.2 miles past the original site, I found a sunnier spot on top of Buzzard Hill.  There was supposed to be a view, but everything seems to be blocked by trees and brush; however, I am happy with sunny and not so muddy.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Haha.  I have the picture from yesterday where I started following the WV - VA state line and that will have to do.  I had to cross a busy street and when I looked one way I saw the welcome to Virginia sign and the welcome to West Virginia sign when I looked the other way. That was cool.  For some reason, when I head to town the day's hike becomes like a horse to the barn mentality.  I had to do almost 9 miles plus numerous town miles, so I made myself slow down a bit.  It was really hot and humid today.

The view from here was very nice. Later the armory superintendent ordered red sandstone pillars put under the rock before the rock fell and hurt people living below. The trail then dumped me at the end of old town and I will admit from here until I got on the C&O Canal Towpath, I had a bit of trouble following the trail.  It would show a double blaze, but I'd look every direction trying to find which way I was supposed to go and never seemed to find a blaze.  I always think when there is a double blaze, there should be another blaze within view to show which direction to go. Today, I'd wander around until I found one.  Drove me crazy this morning. I crossed the Potomac River on a different bridge that also takes trains across.  Hikers and bikers have their own side, it's not like we have to walk on the train tracks. The views from the bridge were nice and I was happy no trains came by while I was on the bridge.  I then followed the C&O Canal Towpath for a couple miles.  I had the railroad tracks and a stagnant canal on one side (read loud trains and mosquito breeding ground) and the lovely Potomac River on the other.  The Towpath was quite busy with bicycles and day hikers out on a beautiful Friday morning. I saw a heron hanging out on a boulder jutting out of the water. Cool birds.Although I didn't see a sign, I think I entered Maryland shortly after I left the Towpath.  I've completed 5 of the 14 states that the AT goes through. I'm booking now.  LolI finally started climbing away from Harper's Ferry, but the sounds of US340 would stay with me most of the morning.  The climb out of town was not to bad and I was making good time. I took a side trail to Weverton Cliffs to get one more look at the Potomac River. There was a couple at the rocks when I arrived having a little make out session.  They obviously wanted the place to themselves, but I found a spot away from them to enjoy some sunshine and my morning snack.  The traffic noise was still extremely loud with trucks making a tremendous amount of noise climbing up mountains. I didn't stay long, but I did like the view.  I continued the climb, but I must say it was fairly easy.  Once I reached the top, the trail mostly leveled off.  Around lunchtime, I arrived at the Gathland State Park.  Nifty little park.  It has the unused tomb of a guy named Gath, he was buried elsewhere when he died.  It also has a War Correspondents Memorial and many information signs pertaining to the civil war.  I had planned on having a long lunch break, but I left when all the other backpackers and day hikers left, because one guy hanging out there gave me a bad vibe.  I always go with what my gut feelings are about  people.  Great state park though and I was able to dump my lunch trash and fill up on water.  Always a plus.As I was leaving the state park, I saw some Mountain Laurel blooming.  Most are still in the bud stage, but a few had opened.  The buds remind me of the sugar decorations people used to decorate their birthday cakes with when I was little.  I had another stopping point with a nice view and another couple was there. I found a spot to have my afternoon snack and enjoy more sunshine, but didn't stay long as I wasn't enjoying their conversation.  There was one more stop called Lambs Knoll with a tower.  I was thinking tower I could climb and see nice views, but it was a cell phone tower.  I'm not sure why I was thinking viewing tower. Haha. I arrived at the shelter I wanted to spend the night very early.  In Maryland, the hikers are required to stayed at shelters and designated campsites.  I could have made the next shelter, but I would have had to bypass the Washington Memorial and I want to spend some time there.  So here I am at the Rocky Run Shelter.  Beautiful shelter with nice shiny floors and windows.  It also has several tent spots with benches.  I really like these benches and could get used to them really fast.  The last shelter in Virginia had them as well.  They provide a nice place to sit, filter water, cook dinner and write my journal in comfort.  My tent site has many mountain laurel bushes blooming behind it. This is a very pretty place to spend the night.  I feel like I am walking towards Mark in this section as I will be meeting up with him next Friday. I can't wait to see him!","Harper's Ferry, WV

It was very close to the trail and definitely worth a visit.  I was there kind of early and there was only one other visitor.  I was able to climb to the top and had a great view of the surrounding area.  It was a wonderful way to start the day.  Being a Saturday, I saw many day hikers.  I saw a trail maintainer and he told me the AT to Annapolis Rocks is the section most hiked in Maryland.  It was the section I saw the most hikers.  There was a view point called Black Rock Cliffs that was a mile further then Annapolis Rocks and I chose to go there instead. I climbed up to take in the views and to have lunch.  There were a few other people there who told me the Annapolis viewpoint was super crowded with a much more limited view.  It was much cooler today then yesterday and no sun.  I don't think I will be seeing the sun for a few more days, but hopefully it warms up a bit more.  Rain is coming tomorrow evening as well.  Bummer. I met a thru-hiker today named Energizer who fits this name very well.  We hiked together for awhile and I heard lots of stories. It is nice to have someone to talk to while I walk once in awhile.  I arrived at the shelter and there are a ton of people here.  A boy scout troop, several thru-hikers including some new flip-flopers that started out of Harper's Ferry and many weekenders.  I enjoyed getting to talk to so many different people.  The shelter almost had a party feel to it.  It will probably be a loud night. The boy scouts are doing something ceremonial with speeches being made loudly and the group next to me are chatting around the fire.  I don't think either group has heard of hiker's midnight.  Lol. Short entry today after a 20 mile day followed by quite of bit of social interaction.  It was fun to talk to the hikers just starting out.  They are filled with excitement still.  A good vibe to be around.","Rocky Run Shelter, MD

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565757,"I got going early and did another long day.  Just past the shelter was a short trail to a great overlook where people launch hang gliders. It was pretty early when I got there and I hung out there for awhile with two young ladies.  I stayed until I got chilled and hiked on.The last miles in Maryland were pretty challenging as it was a boulder field going steeply down.  It was slow going.  I was like geez does every state have to throw something at us at the end.  I arrived at the Pen-Mar County Park about 9.  The caretaker was there, he gave me some bottled water and talked my ear off for awhile.  I enjoyed the last view of Maryland while I was there. Great little park.Right after I left the park, I crossed the Mason-Dixon line and entered Pennsylvania!  Six states down.  Woohoo!!!I hiked to the next little park for lunch. I am loving having all these parks along the way.  I have not had to pump water for a while and my trash bag gets emptied once or twice a day.  Frodo and NoPoles was there and Energizer showed up as well.  We took an extra long lunch which was very nice.  I ate my regular lunch and was still hungry and ate some ramen noodles.  A hot lunch hit the spot.  I loaded up with water from the spigot there, because the water source for this shelter is down 0.5 miles past the shelter.The trail wasn't very exciting, but I enjoyed the afternoon.  I saw a tree wearing a pair of sunglasses.  It looked like a happy tree.  The ferns growing along the side of the trail are beautiful.  Everything is so green and beautiful.  I saw a rock wall in the middle of nowhere.  I think having all the other hikers around last night makes my hike during the day more enjoyable.   It has been nice having some other hikers around to talk to in the evenings.  All of us at lunch were going to the same location for the night.  No one was happy that it was 0.3 down a steep side trail, but it is supposed to rain tonight and we all wanted to be in the shelter.  We are here with a section hiker named DragonDaddy.  DragonDaddy is from PA and he gave us some insight into the different towns and what they provide. It's been a fun evening.","Raven Rock Shelter, MD

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566024,"I hit the halfway point of the trail today.  I missed the sign. Bummer.  Good news is the rain never showed up and I even saw the sun for a few minutes. The miles were pretty easy today; however, there were no highlights besides the halfway point.  The trail crossed numerous roads. It is never very far from civilization that's for sure.  I walked thru another park and did the whole get rid of trash,  get water and use the facilities routine.  I will hit another park tomorrow. It is where the traditional half-gallon ice cream challenge takes place, but it isn't open during the week until after memorial day.  I wasn't going to do it, but I feel bad for Frodo and NoPoles because they wanted to.  I was hoping to pick up more snacks, but that's a no-go to. No biggie though.  I will be in Boiling Springs on Wednesday. I wish more of the trail looked like the picture above, but it is a rare treat to have such a nice trail to walk.Physically the trail was fairly easy today, but mentally it was a tough, tough day for me.  I will sleep on it and hopefully feel normal tomorrow. Short entry, but I'm exhausted. Night.","Rocky Mountain Shelter, PA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566025,"I felt more normal this morning. I think it was a combination of the hikers I met at this shelter and a good nights sleep.  There were three hikers, HodgePodge, Moonshine and Jim, and two ridge runners.  They didn't do anything in particular, but they were all super nice and funny.  HodgePodge in particular lifted my spirits with his sense of humor.We all arrived at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store, home of the half gallon ice cream challenge, within minutes of one another.  The sign said closed as we were told it would be, but we were all wishing it was open so we could get something to eat.  We emptied our trash (yes again) and were just hanging out when the owner of the store said she'd open for us in 30 minutes. Woohoo.  We occupied our time by visiting the AT museum just down the road.  Great little museum.  After the 30 minutes we headed back to the store. As it was only 9:30 in the morning and a bit chilly, no one did the ice cream challenge.  I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries instead.  It was a great second breakfast.  The trail was pretty non-eventful today until I hit the rock maze.  They took the trail up, down and around a jumble of rocks.  It was actually pretty fun.  One spot cracked me up because I could see a blaze and a path directly to the blaze, but an arrow pointed me in a different direction that after going up, down and around some more rocks took me to the blaze I originally saw.  Yes, I went thru the complete maze even when there was an easy way to skip ahead.  It's just what AT hikers do.  When it was over, I decided I deserved a snack.  I continued walking slowly while eating my snack when more rock maze appeared.  I put my snack away and continued following the white blazes and arrows.  I never did finish my snack.I arrived just south of the shelter and found Jim and Moonshine setting up.  They said this was a better spot to tent then at the shelter and it had a water source feet away.  Worked for me.  Jim earned the trail name Rooster today, because he carries a stuffed rooster to pose in his pictures.  Two other women were here as well and we had a fire and dinner.  Moonshine ran a bear line that we all used.","Tom Runs Shelter, PA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566373,"It was raining when I woke up; but my phone said it would stop in about an hour, so I snuggled back into my sleeping bag.  When the rain finally stopped, I was the first one moving and decided to go get all the food bags.  However; MoonShine's knot was very elaborate and very tight and I could not get it undone.  I went back to let him know he'd have to undo it.  It was late by my standards, but I still felt bad asking him to get up before he wanted.  Rooster (Jim) started packing up and is headed back south to end his short section.  He asked me to pose with his stuffed rooster and I'm sad I didn't get a picture of it myself.  It was a funny picture. The walk into Boiling Springs was very pleasant.  It went through farm fields  which allowed expansive views of the surrounding area.  It was much different and a nice change from being in the green tunnel.  Moonshine entered town just behind me.  We dropped our packs at the local ATC office and headed to breakfast. We met Squire, Stretch and Remix, a father and two young boys, who are doing a thru-hike and an incredibly nice and interesting family.  I love all the different people I am meeting out here.Boiling Springs is a really quaint and pretty little town.  I wished I was spending the night in this town as it had more to offer then many of the small towns I've been to.  However, the only options was a campground by the busy railroad tracks or a new hostel that is a bit outside of town defeating the purpose of actually experiencing.  Therefore, I did a small resupply and headed out of town.The walk from town took me through more farm fields and over several highways before it finally headed up a mountain.  I saw HoneyStick taking a break and ended up hiking to the shelter with her.  It was really awesome to have someone to talk to for awhile while hiking.  We came to an one of the rare overviews in Pennsylvania and it even had a bench.  The bench was deep enough to sit down with our packs providing a wonderful backrest.  We hung out there taking in the lovely view.  It was still kind of early and we were in no rush.We made the final push to the shelter and found quite a crowd of people there.  It was quite a mix of southbounders, north bounders, flip-floppers, section hikers and repeat offenders (people hiking for the second or more time).  The mix made for interesting dinner conversation and a fun evening.","Alec Kennedy Shelter, PA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566685,"It rained most of the night and was supposed to rain all day.  Last night the southbounders talked about how rocky the last four miles were going to be and tricky due to the rain making the rocks slippery.  Even AWOL's guide said it was difficult.  Taking in this advice, I wanted a somewhat early start as I was thinking the day's hike would take longer then normal.  I packed up a very wet tent and was on the trail by 7:30.  Although it was raining, the temperature was on the warm side.  Warm and rain is way better to hike in then cold and rain.  It wasn't a torrential downpour and I was headed to town, so all was good.  When it's raining like that, it's a rain jacket hood up, head down kind of hiking day.  I was hiking along when I almost ran into a southbounder in the same hiking mode.  We laughed and he told me the descent into town wasn't that bad and it wasn't a boulder field, but rock steps.  I reached a couple of overviews that were socked in with fog.  Bummer. There were two day hikers there taking pictures of the fog which I've done before.  When you work to see something, it is just something you do.  The descent wasn't bad at all.  Mostly steps that were fairly easy to negotiate even though they were wet.  The rain had stopped earlier and the mosquitoes in this area were annoying.  Since I was already soaked, I almost wished the drizzle would start back up to get them to stop buzzing my head.  The trail goes right through town, but lacked white blazes.  This is where GutHook really comes in handy.  It showed me the path to the Doyle, my destination for the night.  I had heard such bad things about the Doyle, but I think it compares pretty well with some of the other hostels I've stayed.  I actually had my own room with a lock and could spread all my gear out to dry.  Its not someplace I'd normally chose to stay, but I'd say the same thing about all the hostels. I think one of the reasons it gets a bad rap is because there are rules.  Some hikers do not like having any restrictions placed on them. There were a couple motels a couple miles away, but I decided staying around all the other hikers was more important.  It would make the wait for Mark more enjoyable.  I can't wait to see him.","Duncannon, PA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566842,"Mark picked me up at the Doyle Hotel on Friday for a weekend away from the trail.  We had a great time just being together.  I will admit that it was 50-50 whether I'd get back on the trail or go home with him on Monday.  I was able to talk through what I was feeling and I decided if any part of me wanted to stay on the trail, I needed to stay and continue my journey north.  He drove me an hour to an REI where I switched out some gear.  We went to Chocolate World in Hershey, PA where I ate lots of chocolate. That was awesome.  I was always asking when we would eat again although by Sunday afternoon I felt like I'd finally eaten enough.  I would eat until I felt full, but the hunger would come back quickly.  Hiker hunger is crazy.  The fitness room at the hotel had a scale and I'm down 20 pounds.  I took a nap every day as well.  It was a great weekend and seriously needed break with Mark.  I loved every minute of it.  Hope we get to do it again before this journey is over.  It will get harder to meet up the further north I get.  If we aren't able to meet up, I will see him at Baxter State Park when I get there.","Duncannon, PA

SunSeeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566843,"Mark dropped me back off at the Doyle Hotel this morning.  Tough goodbye.  So, so hard to watch him drive away.  I figured out which way the trail went and started walking north again.  It was a pretty long road walk through town past many houses,  across two bridges and over some railroad tracks before I finally made it into the woods.  I was told the rocks that Pennsylvania is known for started as soon as I crossed the river today.  The trail went up as I left Duncannon with many switchbacks.  It was a pretty easy climb (I never thought I'd ever say that).  I arrived at a view with several day hikers hanging out, but it was socked in with fog.  They told me they could almost see something. Lol. When I got to the top of the ridge, I entered a boulder field that seriously slowed me down.  I was thinking that if the rest of Pennsylvania is like this, I did not bring enough food.  The rocks were wet and slippery.  I tried to take my time and move deliberately to avoid sliding or falling. I met a couple south bound hikers and they were not happy with the rocks.  The boulders lasted for what seemed a really long time, but it eventually returned to a more normal rocky trail.  What I call the boulder fields require more concentration for me to hike through and really slow me down.  What I call the normal rocky trail is what I've been hiking thru for awhile now especially on top of ridges.  I met three ladies doing a section hike south bound. I met them on Friday at the Doyle while I was waiting for Mark.  They seemed to be enjoying themselves and mentioned the many rocks and boulders they have encountered. They also mentioned some trail magic near the parking lot I'd be crossing in a couple miles.  When I arrived at the parking lot an hour or so later, I saw signs for the trail magic.  A family was having a Memorial Day Picnic and all thru-hikers were welcome. I know I'm not a thru-hiker, but I figured a SLASHer would be welcome.  (SLASHer - super long ass section hiker). What a welcome I was given! The view from the family cabin was amazing as well. This is the best trail magic I've ever encountered.  The family had quite the spread of food and drinks and I was welcomed to have whatever I wanted.  There were several other hikers enjoying themselves when I arrived.  I had a hot dog, hamburger, several different types of salad, tea and a root beer float.  I talked to several members of the family.  They all made me feel very welcome.  What a generous family and I'm a better person for having spent time with them.  I only had three more miles to hike to the shelter once I left the picnic.  They were pretty easy miles and I soon arrived.  I had read that the trail to the water was seriously steep, so I filled up at the last shelter.  The forecast looks pretty good so I wanted to tent.  The area right around the shelter had way to many dead trees, so I'm a bit up the trail.  Windy tonight, but still kind of warm. Hope I sleep well. I feel like my journal entries are getting a bit monotonous.  If there is something you'd like to hear about, let me know.","Duncannon, PA
