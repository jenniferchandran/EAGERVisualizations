Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554035,"I'm lying in my warm soft bed and relishing the comfort. I know it'll change soon. We'll be leaving home in 20 days to begin our journey. Our discussions after dinner these days seem to generally center on one subject. The Appalachian Trail has invaded our lives and is calling us daily. My wife and I are eager to begin but I'm a little fearful too. I turned 60 a few months ago and I wonder how my old body will hold up. I could lie and talk about my conditioning efforts to prepare for this adventure, but my truth is: I'm winging it. We have a three day hike in a week to sort out equipment, packing, food, and pack weight but that's it. See why I'm scared?If you could prepare by reading, I'd be set. I've read countless books about the AT, scrutinized gear reviews, engaged in lengthy conversations with sales people at outfitters, and have been obsessed with hiking. I just haven't done it yet.The details of leaving our home for six months are being crossed off daily. It's almost time to go and we're going to do this!

Fatboy & Ginger will be starting from Georgia the first week of March on our adventure. We are so grateful for each other and our loving relationship. I'm honored every day with the blessing of my beautiful wife. We have reached out to friends for help and they all have responded with generosity and kindness. Our home and pets will be well cared for.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554118,"We spent the evening packaging food for our ""shakedown"" hike next week. It's intimidating trying to figure out what,how much, and how to pack this stuff. Food has always been a very important part of my life. Now I need to consider how much it weighs and how easily it's going to cook! Emotions come into play and differing perceptions of how to complete this surface.This may be a lot more complicated than I thought.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554428,"Our shakedown hike was a success! We spent three nights on the Lone Star Hiking Trail and had a lot of laughs. We carried WAY too much stuff and it was hot. The important thing for us was: we learned a lot about our water filtration and what clothing really is important. It rained very lightly one night so we had a wet tent but nothing else got wet and we were comfortable. We did have one water crossing that wasn't much fun, but we made it without major incident. Fatboy has been wet and muddy before. Ginger made it look easy, but that wasn't really a surprise because she's the athlete! We decided to walk the roads to avoid the water crossing on the return trip and met a very nice lady named Kim. Her car had a paw print sticker that said ""Who Rescued Who?"" so we knew she must be OK. It seems there are a lot of people who are intrigued by seeing people out walking with packs on their backs. We also met a Texas Wildlife Game Warden named Brown. She was very helpful. When we told her we planned to walk a gas line easement to get back to the trail she informed us that we would cross a deer lease if we did that and if caught we would be prosecuted for trespassing. She suggested she give us a ride back to the trail head, which we accepted because we wouldn't be able to access any public land with the remaining daylight. It turns out that she delivered us back to where our truck was parked. That was a good thing because Fatboy had a recurrence of a chronic foot problem that was making walking become increasingly painful. We finished our hike one day early and headed home. We accomplished what we wanted with this hike and are looking forward to starting the AT soon.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554723,"We aren't sleeping well. Visions of hiker meals are dancing in my head. We've spent the last few days exhausting all of the local grocery stores' supplies of dried vegetables and fruit bars. I'd ordered some items from Amazon but I wasn't prepared for the quantity of food required for 125 trail days. We both are committed to eating nutritious meals as much as possible and don't want to have to rely on what we can get from sources on the trail. I found a website called My Yummy Life written by a lady who makes hiker meals for her husband. This was very helpful and included lots of tips and tricks for making meals tasty and easy to prepare. Our kitchen was the assembly line and lots of zip lock baggies have been filled and proportioned into boxes for delivery to friends who've agreed to mail supplies to us. Our meals are almost set!
The details of leaving our home for six months are almost all complete and we are both ready to just get started. We're going to miss our dogs (Cleopatra, Droo, and Pete) and all of our local friends but we both recognize how blessed we are to be able to participate in this experience with each other.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555471,"We had three flights scheduled to get us to family en route to begin our hike. Our earliest flight was at 0530 and was without any trouble. We arrived in Houston on time but the plane nose gear steering mechanism needed repair so we were delayed past the connecting time for our flight to Newark. I have a map so I already know that Newark NJ is NOT between Houston and Akron OH. Airline travel makes for interesting journeys. At the end of the day we arrived in Akron at 2115 instead of the 1345 as per our original schedule. We did have the pleasure of meeting a mother traveling with her 8 month old son, Joseph, and sharing some time playing with him and listening to her story. It was wonderful to be with a young mother who really seemed to enjoy her child and let him be a baby without worrying about everything. He crawled around and played with the straps on our luggage and never became fussy once. She was refreshing.
We spent the next few days celebrating family birthdays and explaining why we were going on our adventure. Most of the people in both of our families don't seem to understand why we would begin a trip like this but they are all very supportive and loving. We're very grateful for that.
We had a day of travel via rental car with an overnight in White Sulfur Springs W Va and a final destination of Dumfries Va. We spent a couple of nights with family and somewhere along the way both started to feel sick. We flew from Washington DC to Atlanta and were met by Josh from the Hiker Hostel. (Here's a hint. If you need to use the restroom in the MARTA, ask before you exit the station. The restrooms are very poorly marked, locked and require an attendant to give you access. You have to pay $3.50 to get back in just to use the facility. It's a bummer but if you have to go, you have to go!)
The Hiker Hostel was really nice and the people were very helpful. We were both feeling quite ill and fortunately had arranged to be in a private cabin. A private bathroom was a benefit for everyone. I can't imagine what a nightmare it would have been for us to be in a communal living situation. We decided we weren't ready to hike the next day so we arranged to stay at the Amicalola Falls Lodge. We arrived at the lodge early in the morning and the staff was very helpful. At this point Ginger was almost curled into a fetal position and exhausted and I could barely stand. The staff made a room available for us and we both fell into a glorious bed and slept most of the next 24 hours.","Corpus Christi, Texas

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555496,"First post from Jen, who has emerged from the delirium of The Flu!After months of dreaming, planning, reading and preparing , we are here at the AT Approach Trail, about 8 miles from Springer Mountain, the official southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. And we did a portion of it yesterday. Twice.Our health test while recovering was to hike down the 600+ steps from Amicalola Falls lodge, leaving our packs at the top. ... which meant we'd eventually have to come back up.At the visitor center, we registered our thru-hike. I am Hiker No. 348 for 2017; Nathan is 349. Then, cheery, seasoned hiker Rachel (AT 2015), with the ATC, handed us that school bus yellow AT Leave No Trace placard I so coveted from online photos. ""Bears are real,"" she shared, and showed us her canister adorned with claw marks from Tray Mountain. I'm glad we splurged on one to carry ourselves. It added some weight, but looks like it'll be worth it. And by packing our double sleeping bag instead of two individual ones in their separate stuff sacks and liners, we banked 2 pounds. At the last weigh-in, without water on board, Nathan's pack was 34 pounds. Mine is 29. We think this is a good place to start.Rachel showed us a parallel path back to the lodge -- sans steps! -- and we concluded that one more night at the lodge would be wise. We will begin tomorrow, Saturday, March 4, 2017, somewhere along the Approach Trail and hike past Springer.In the meantime, the good folks at Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge are taking good care of us and other hikers who file through. The annual AT Kick Off starts this evening but is underway in earnest tomorrow, with many presenters and authors whose names we recognize. I don't believe in coincidences any more, except to at first acknowledge the coincidence, then give credit to a Higher Power whose plans I can't possibly fathom. I sure do get a kick out of watching them unfold ... or looking back and seeing the gift in what might not have felt like it at the time.What am I talking about?We planned to start the trail two days ago. Had I not been so weak and ill that we checked into the lodge, we would have been exposed on the trail when a severe storm blew in with golf ball hail, lightning and 50 mph winds. Never mind the rain that we're sure to see plenty of later.Plus,We'd almost giving up on the Approach Trail and considered a shuttle to Springer, missing out on the Falls experience and walking through that famed arch I've seen in movies and photos and wanted to be a part of. I thought of it like a wedding threshold. Turns out, we could approach The Approach creatively! There, we met a woman traveling the country solo in her RV with a motorized scooter, grateful for parks like this one that are ADA accessible. Nathan took her photo at the Falls. Had we not decided to ""slack-pack"" the Approach Trail flip-flop style, we wouldn't have met Rachel, with her recommendations and affirmations (and a photo of us in the arch, which she took and texted from her personal phone because ours weren't cooperating).And what I always come back to:Nathan, and the experiences that brought us together and the adventures we get to have together. Not just talking and scheming but actually doing. I heard Nathan chatting with sweet Barbara, who got us into a Lodge room in record time before I hurled again. Barbara shared with him that we're doing her bucket list. After a few pleasantries and jokes, Nathan asked, pointedly, ""What if someone takes the bucket away?""We're not going to wait to find out. Today is it.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555560,"I can't sleep. Woke up with the beginning of this Thoreau excerpt on my mind. Sharing the full paragraph here. I think it helps explain why we -- I'm -- here. I shouldn't speak for Nathan, who is sleeping peacefully.From Henry David Thoreau's ""Walden"":""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.""Feels like I'm awaiting this morning like I did Santa as a kid.Jen (at 2:32 am ... 2:42 ... 2:55 ... here's hoping for more sleep ...)","

But we did it. Huffing and puffing, but done! We each picked up a little rock to carry to Khatadin, Maine. There's granite everywhere. It's prettier in nature than in countertops, and it stands out even in the forest. Also spotted today: acorns and what we think are buckeyes. Nathan had his first Go Raw bar. My thoughts: ""Mmmmmmmm ... a full serving of organic, dehydrated fruit with flax seed."" Nathan's: ""It looks like somebody already ate it!"" That kept me laughing nearly to the top of Frosty Mountain.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556369,"From Ginger:We chose to spend our first trail night in the shelter at Black Gap. It was just the two of us in there, and probably a good thing since we sound like the Typhoid Duo, coughing and sniffing and shifting all night long. There was a sea of tents at the campsite. We were both extremely cold all might; we'll likely join the tenters in the future. After reading about mice in shelters and snorers and myriad other commentary about shelter pitfalls, I was reluctant to try a shelter, but this was a large one, and I'm proud of us for giving it a shot. Another reminder of how ""contempt prior to investigation"" could have been limiting!At Black Gap we met two Greenville, S.C., guys section-hiking for the week. They blessed us with their instant coffee packets on their final morning. Coffee for us is like cash to others. One of them has the trail name Cleanshave for now. Not sure if that's the new resident physician or the commercial realtor. I've been calling them The Handsome Twins. Nick, the guy in commercial real estate whose dad was born where I was (Shaw Air Force Base in S.C.), introduced us to his Instagram series: Bad Yoga in Pretty Places. Then they entertained us with poses. The Emery grad trackster was more flexible than he gave himself credit for.Reached Stover Creek Shelter after a short day hiking (just 4.3 miles). Lots of time to claim a tent site and get to know our temporary neighbors. Kentucky Morning, a career Marine, first joined us on site. Followed by fellow sailor Eric and outdoorsy Kate; Sophia the landscape photographer and undergrad; Spencer; MountANDmusic; Big Daddy; and two other married couples!I'm relieved to be hearing other people share their fears about the trail -- that they don't always know what they're doing, that they ""hope"" to get to Maine (some of us hedging it, as if that makes the possibility of not finishing more acceptable), that gear might need to be changed out. Maybe I expected more know-it-alls. I'm grateful for people's vulnerability. We're in it together.","Black Gap Shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556366,"From Fatboy:I hiked too far today. It was very windy on the peaks and I knew we would be too exposed and cold to camp there. We finally made Horse Gap and I was exhausted. It was our longest day yet. By the time we stopped, I was nauseated and not processing information clearly. Set up near a road on an incline. Sophia suggested sleeping there wouldn't be too bad. Her wisdom earned her the trail name ""Sunshine"" because she was definitely blowing sunshine up my skirt. It turned out to be brilliant! We didn't cough as much, which was likely helped by having our heads elevated. Before bed, Jen told me she was going back up the trail for privacy. I was sitting on a log and heard a crashing noise down a steep gully below our campsite. I became fixated on the idea that Jen had fallen and needed my help. I stumbled down the hill and began yelling her name. I got kind of frantic because it was almost dark and I couldn't find her. I scrambled up the hill to get help searching g for her and she was at the tent worried because she couldn't find me. Our new protocol is to repeat directions back to each other so there isn't that confusion. It really works best if we just don't separate beyond visual contact. My imagination goes nuts with the universe of bad things that could happen to her when we're apart.I think I smelled a bear during the night. I didn't hear anything but there was a definite zoo smell that was strong enough to wake me. Another camper who was near us confirmed that he smelled something too. No sightings yet but there's a lot of talk on the trail.","Stover Creek Shelter campsite

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556371,"From Fatboy:We hiked all day with intermittent rain. It wasn't too cold so it was tolerable. Sassafras Mountain wasn't as tough as we were warned. Water didn't turn out to be an issue because there was a military water buffalo at a road crossing. Sweet water tasted really good and it was a welcome change to not have to filter it. We finally made the shelter and it was packed! It was raining pretty hard so everyone was crammed into the table overhang area. We set up our tent on another incline because all the flat areas were already occupied. Another night on the slip and slide. The conversations with hikers are interesting. Tarzan and Kate are here with Sunshine and Spencer. Kentucky Morning aka Pegleg is here as well as Big Baby. The crazy bipolar guy with the psych service dog. An English teacher living in Brazil, Jacob is doing a five day section with his 65 year old dad, Don. The most amazing trail magic happened. A guy showed up, announcing himself as a firefighter, because the shelter was overcrowded!! The stunned looks turned to smiles as the guy explained he began his thru-hike in 2015 and finished last year. He brough in two pizzas and a bunch of 16 oz sodas! I got half a piece of pepperoni pizza and a Mt. Dew! The rain abated a little and we decided to retire. I fell and got covered with mud on the way to the tent. It continues to rain but we're warm and dry. Tomorrow promises to be clear skies. It'll be nice to dry out. We're actively making our shopping list to resupply and upgrade some gear at Neel gap.

It was a bright sunny morning so the hiking was good. We came to a gap and met ""Ray of Sunshine"" at his truck and he had sodas, chips, and tangerines. This is the same angel that brought us pizza last night. He now drives here from Louisville, Kentucky, just to give trail magic. A tangerine and a Mountain Dew never tasted so good! We hiked to the start of the Chatahoochee National Forest. We said goodbye to Jacob and Don and look forward to hearing from Jacob again. We hiked a few more miles and found a really great site (near Dockery Lake Trailhead) with Tarzan, Squirrel, Sunshine, and Hawk Man. These four are the most interesting young people I've ever met. They all are experienced outdoors people and seem wise beyond there years. Tarzan (Eric) crewed on the Alyssa in Galveston and is a wilderness Instructor. Squirrel (Kate) just graduated from Ohio University and has a farming background. Sunshine (Sophia) is only hiking during her spring break from OU. Hawk Man (Spencer) is 23 and has worked at a raptor sanctuary and is also a wilderness Instructor. I'm.grateful for the time we shared.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556373,"From Fatboy:Long brutal day over Blood Mountain. The views were spectacular but the rocks were treacherous. The Blood Mountain Shelter is all stone and stands exposed at the peak (pics and captions coming from Ginger). We signed the log book and it was fun to see entries by familiar names. Descending was more rocks and I fell on and broke a hiking stick and made a small blood donation of my own so I had to come most of the way down with only one stick. That wasn't as much fun as it sounds but I did it. We met a local named Donny who day-hiked part of the way up Blood Mountain just to hang a hammock and read. He was upbeat and positive and made a painful descent seem a lot easier. We finally made Neels Gap around 1600 and at Mountain Crossings immediately found Pegleg and Big Boy (formerly Big Baby). They gifted me with soda and candy. Jen bought dried mangoes for her, more candy for me, and I felt much better. We never had lunch and I was running on fumes. We said goodbye to Sunshine but will probably meet up with some of the others as we continue. Jen rented us a room at Misty Mountain and the manager, Craig, picked us up at Neels Gap. We stopped at a convenience store and I recognized it from a one of my long bike rides. Booger Hollow! Craig waited as we ordered pizzas and went nuts buying snacks and stuff. He delivered us right to the door of the cutest little cabin, did our laundry, and gave us breakfast oatmeal with dried fruit and lots of nuts. It was heavenly to get full, get clean, and get into a soft warm bed with my beautiful wife. The coffee pot is set to go for the morning and I am a happy old man.
From Ginger:
We got our first resupply box courtesy of Mountain Crossings, and Ann in Portland, Texas. Thank you! Loved the feeling inside this cozy outfitter. It's a hiker's dream after days in the woods, plus goodies I'd like off the trail: tees, stickers, car decals. Maybe I'll get to use their online discount when we're home. The owner started stocking those mangoes I bought after meeting the company founder while hiking in Nicaragua. I'm diggin' hearing all these little connection stories.
Also digging how excited Nathan is to be in civilization. He's truly a great sport out here, and now giddy in town. And I'm discovering new things about him. Like how much he enjoys the scent of clean laundry. He buried his nose in our freshly cleaned clothes for at least a minute.","Lance Creek area

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556375,"From Fatboy:Great day. We zeroed at Misty Mountain Inn & Cottages. Craig Griffiths shuttled us around town to resupply and buy new hiking sticks. I've learned that I really need the stability and shock absorbing I get from using the sticks, especially on descents with difficult footing.   We had a great lunch of some kind of Alfredo stuff with black beans and garbanzos and tortillas stuffed with salad. The fresh greens were delicious! Then we had the vital task of napping and reading for the rest of the day. We return to Neel Gap at 0830 so Ginger can get another pair of hiking pants. It's really a shame that some women's gear is so much less utilitarian than men's. Her pockets are so small that they're almost useless. Her clothes cost as much as mine but they aren't the same quality. I hope some manufacturer figures that out and fixes that problem. We're packed and ready for a return to the trail for a 7.8 mile hike to Whitley Gap Shelter. The weather is threatening snow tomorrow night so if we can't get a space in the shelter we will plan on a shuttle back into Blairsville.From Ginger:Also got to meet Inn co-owner Patty Griffiths, who showed us around the main house and shared with us her vision for the place.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556429,"From Fatboy:The hike today was reasonably uneventful. It drizzled and spit snow intermittently all day. We paused at a road crossing and I saw a grandfather with his grandson playing in the snow. We talked for a couple of minutes and the old man said I was living his dream. We get that a lot. Either people are just saying that as a conversation filler or there are a lot of people who forget to live their dreams. We discovered that Whitley Gap Shelter was 1.2 miles off trail and debated the merit of going there. We decided to check it out anyway and passed a multiple of good camping spots on the trail. Each becoming more inviting. We arrived at the shelter to discover that we were alone! Score for team Porter! We decided to put our tent inside the shelter because it was supposed to snow more. We broke the end off our center ridge pole on our tent and I was able to repair it with the multitool I brought on a whim. It really is as good as new after the repair and I finally had the feeling that I could excel at something because repairing things is my hobby.Through the course of the evening we were joined by Just Jim. A through hiker from Pennsylvania who had two solar panels hanging on the back of his pack. I was making coffee and offered him a cup which he, somewhat reluctantly, accepted. I found out later that he was hiking without a stove of any kind. He chose to have a charged cellphone instead of hot food. I really don't understand. Another couple showed up and set up their tent in the shelter also. Veronica (Tequila Sunrise) and her husband Edwin (Happy Feet) are from Florida and are originally from Venezuela. They are really friendly and very interesting to talk to. I took some cold medicine and was able to sleep the whole night through with minimal coughing. That was amazing. We were been serenaded by a group of owls.From Ginger: Those owls literally sounded like monkeys calling to each other! I actually asked Nathan whether he thought it was possible that monkeys were out there! Another guy suspected an animal was sniffing and grunting near his tent ... until he realized that the sounds were someone snoring nearby. I don't think Nathan nor I are sleeping well enough for that yet. I'm definitely warmer, though, since our trip to Walmart. We found individual bag liners there. At the last minute we ditched ours at home, expecting two bodies in one double bag would be warm enough. We couldn't have predicted just how chilly it can be out here.","Misty Mountain Inn, Blairsville

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556430,"From Fatboy:We awoke to a white world at 0800. It was cold and bright and I didn't want to get out of my sleeping bag. We had coffee and breakfast were out of camp fairly early. Our goal was Low Gap Shelter. The hiking today seemed easier. Maybe the terrain was not as severe and maybe I'm becoming healthy again. Being able to breathe is a nice change. We made it to Low Gap Shelter around 1600. It was still wet and quite cold. We met PegLeg at the shelter. It was great to see her as we'd heard that she left the Trail for health reasons. She has a damaged left lower leg with some neuropathy and non-healing wounds that she feared were becoming infected. It seems a zero with wound care was enough to allow her to continue. Our camaraderie with this fluid group is fun and hugely entertaining at times. There are Spring Breakers, section hikers, day hikers, and thru hikers of all age groups and backgrounds. We have our tent on reasonably level ground, we're dry, we're warm and we're together. I'm a grateful man.From Ginger:... and I am a grateful woman. I'm still marveling at Nathan's composure as he repaired the tent yesterday. He's so calm, approaching tasks like that. There's no cursing, no exasperation -- just OK, here's what happened and here's what I do next. One thing follows the other, as if he's just putting on socks then shoes. I think that's acceptance, embodied. No matter the weather or exterior circumstances!I'm also feeling like I'm truly part of the fellowship out here. Not separate from, a rookie that others will dismiss or with something to prove. I just learned the AT motto: ""A footpath for those who seek fellowship in the wilderness."" I really never considered that aspect before our hike. I'd viewed this as a competition between myself and nature. The ultimate physical and psychological challenge. How strong am I REALLY? I think it was the mountain talking when I arrived at this: We are co-existing with nature. Nathan and I are doing this together. And I am doing this with the wilderness. The quicker I can adjust to nature, which I cannot change, the more comfortable I am, and the less this is a challenge. It's another trudge, where we walk with purpose.My growing comfort with the fellowship must be why I leapt at PegLeg to hug her when she came trotting down the trail to Low Gap Shelter. Same for Veronica and Edwin a bit later. I was elated to see them.Post script:We had a campfire, courtesy of Drop Top. (Ginger here with the details, filed away for use soon! The area was soaked, but he explained there is a forest full of dry wood: Just look for branches that have fallen recently and/or might be caught on neighboring trees. Then he demo'd how to use twigs and branches of sizes narrower than a pencil, then wider ... and how to dry larger logs while the fire burns. I didn't remember all this from Girl Scouts!) Drop Top was diligent and very skilled. I was very grateful for the warmth and the fun conversations. There was a hiker from North Ontario who was taking a break to hike before she started grad school. Our Canadian friend began lamenting her difficulties with the measuring system for distances in the USA. Miles, feet, yards and temperature were difficult for her. Drop Top chimed in with the statement: There are only two types of countries in the world. Those who have put a man on the moon and those that use the metric system. Badaboom!","Whitley Gap Shelter

My hands were frozen and I had to retrieve our ice encrusted bear canister from the bear cables before I could even make coffee. At least I didn't fall this time. We had our coffee, ate our breakfast, and packed up our stuff. Ginger takes care of most of the heavy lifting of the process and is gracious enough to not complain. She is my beautiful wife and best friend and I'm grateful every day for her.We decided to make it to Unicoi Gap and I made the silly assumption that we would have an easy day based on the topography shown in our guide book. There were some areas of level, soft trail but there were a lot of rocks. Lots of rocks. We had ups and downs with a constant cold wind that was very uncomfortable while traversing the peaks. We passed Blue Mountain Shelter with only 2.5 miles to Unicoi Gap. I kept trudging and was becoming more uncomfortable but our goal was approaching. We debated calling a shuttle or trying to hitch a ride when we arrived at the parking area. Ginger was looking at the map and I was hobbling along behind her while joking about how fast I was moving. I noticed a car approaching and I waved at it. The driver immediately pulled over and one of the kindest men I've met gave us a ride to Helen. Randy D. Is a trail angel in the finest sense. He shared his time and offered suggestions about restaurants in Helen while delivering us directly to the door of our hotel. The trail magic was just beginning. We were greeted by a gracious staff at the Quality Inn who gave us coffee, fruit, a room on the ground floor, and a hiker discount. They have a free hot breakfast and coffee 24/7, too! One of the staff even offered to give us a ride back to the trail when we were ready. He shared his dreams of hiking the trail and was very interested in our journey.We retired to our room. Ibuprofen, showers, delivery pizza, salad, soft drinks, and a warm soft bed.Perfect.","Low Gap Shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556432,"From Fatboy:An interesting thing seems to happen every time we stay off trail. I can't sleep very well. It's almost as though I have too much stuff around me. We watched TV for a while last evening while eating pizza and salads and I couldn't sleep. Maybe it has something to do with eating enough food for three grown men to survive for a week in one sitting? Ginger slept like a baby, but that always has been her super-power. Our complimentary, hot breakfast of waffles, eggs, biscuits, sausage gravy, fruit juice and limitless coffee was wonderful. We set out to explore Helen with our list of needs. We began by walking 1 1/2 miles to a fly fishing outfitter and found some neat mittens for Ginger. We're still on the hunt for a neck waiter for her. We stopped at Ace Hardware, the Dollar Store, a gun shop and had lunch at a German bakery. Back to the room for a nap.Random trail wisdom.•Don't use dried refried beans as your protein in too many of your meals. The tent will begin to smell like a septic tank.•Don't go overboard with flax meal and chia seeds. Digging cat holes in the woods after frantically searching for some privacy isn't as much fun as you might think.•Don't run out of toilet paper. It is painful for bibliophiles to tear pages from their books.•Always use hand sanitizer. Being on the trail really makes you appreciate the miracle of clean running water and soap.•Never go to bed without enough water to make coffee and breakfast. Filtering water you've just dipped from a stream before coffee is barbaric.•Never go anywhere without your knife and a hat.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557432,From Fatboy:We were packed and ready to go by 0700 this morning and sitting in the hotel breakfast room watching the weather channel. Georgia and a lot of the East is experiencing extreme cold weather (dubbed Severe Storm Stella). It was way too easy to talk myself into staying for a second zero day. Ginger worked on the lobby computer for a while and I went back to bed. The daytime temperatures never exceeded the mid 20's and that's too cold for this South Texan to want to walk in the woods. We did walk about 3 miles in town. We went to the post office to mail our granddaughter's birthday card and yet another visit to the Dollar General. The wind was biting and cold even though the day was very sunny. I continue to suffer from plantar fascitis but these rest days walking without a pack are allowing some healing. I'm experimenting with a foot taping technique I learned of via YouTube so I'm hopeful to have some pain relief. We've arranged for a ride back to Unicoi Gap at 0800 tomorrow and we're ready for some better hiking conditions.,"Quality Inn - Helen

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557433,"From Fatboy:The manager of the Quality Inn, Cary, gave us a ride to Unicoi Gap. It was a pleasure to stay at that inn. Cary is young and enthusiastic and reminds me a lot of my son. The hike North from Unicoi Gap is a long climb followed by a long descent. I felt strong and my foot only hurt a little. The days off and taping really helped. I can't wait to get to Hiawasee to get some KT Tape so I can really tape my right foot correctly. The tape we found in Helen began to burn my skin so I had to remove it.We met a trail angel named LionHeart who had a camp stove in the back of his truck and was making hot chocolate. It was below freezing and the hot beverage was wonderful. He even had fresh fruit. It's amazing how generous and caring these trail angels are. We hiked our first double digit day and ended at Sassafras Gap tenting. The water was listed as 0.2 miles down a steep hill. That was an understatement. It was STEEP! We socialized with the other hikers for a little while and retired before 2000. It was cold and we plan on a short day tomorrow.","Unicoi Gap

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557438,"From Fatboy:Happy St. Patrick's Day!   We made a rookie mistake and brought a water bladder into the tent with us. It leaked about a liter during the night and I thought I was just cold from the ground. I was sleeping (not really much) in a puddle of ice cold water. Ginger had all of her clothes on and my down jacket over it all. We were pretty miserable and dumped a puddle of muddy water out of our tent before we packed up to go. Neither of us was very cheery or talkative.From Ginger:It was so confusing and crushing to be that cold after a couple of warmer nights on the trail. We'd bought bag liners, and I added a base layer for sleeping. Plus I had Nathan's down jacket on top of my own coat. What in the world was wrong?! Temps were even a few degrees higher than they had been! It was my first nearly defeating experience. My body is fine -- no blisters or pain, and no soreness yet that rivals what I get from a Pinnacle workout. (And I truly thank the Pinnacle team at home, Mom and Dad's genes, and God every day for that. I wish I could lend a pain-free foot and knee to Nathan, even if for a few hours!) What gave me comfort that night was something my father-in-law -- my Ohio dad -- assured us when we left them. I'm paraphrasing in quote form, but only a bit. His voice in my head that night was, ""Honey, you just let me know if you need to be picked up. I'll be there. Wherever it is."" I fell asleep alternately praying and imagining I had one of those radios from the TV show ""Alone,"" and I called and said, ""I'm done."" Then wrestled with regretting giving in to the cold.I didn't talk about it with Nathan until the fear and urgency had passed. I was worried we'd comfort each other into bailing. I don't think I'll doubt that again. I know better: We're stronger together. He knows not to quit on a single bad day, and reminded me of that when I was ready to be vulnerable about the rough night. As I type this after those difficult hours that felt like multiple days, I'm so glad we didn't stop. It was only 6 miles to town, and eventually -- after an indulgent two cups of coffee each (Nathan is so good to me), we were able to laugh at the circumstances that set the night in motion. We survived. Score another for Team Porter.Back to Fatboy:Our goal for the day was Dick's Creek Gap. It was cold and windy and muddy with lots of ups and downs. Ginger was able to make a phone call from a peak to arrange a shuttle and reserve the last room at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. We hustled to meet our ride after I estimated a meet time of 1600-1630. The shuttle driver, Bob, was prior Navy and he and I talked the whole ride about our experiences in the Philippines. We picked up another hiker at Unicoi Gap who was hiking with a blonde labradoodle named Yankee. He was a beautiful but very tired pup. We checked in to the Budget Inn and placed all of our wet stuff out to dry in our room. We then walked what seemed like a mile to an AYCE at Daniel's Steak House. The food was wonderful and I even got a senior discount! That's the first benefit to being 60 I've found on this hike yet. We got KT Tape and compression stockings at the pharmacy and Ginger is going to tape my foot up following directions we found on a YouTube video. Back to the room to get ourselves and our clothes clean. We opened our mail we received from Michael S. In Corpus Christi. He and his wife sent us our food AND included a mini bar of good soap, a card, some money to buy dinner, some candy, and laminated cards with the serenity prayer on them. Ginger and I both shared tears of gratitude for the kindness of our friend. We were tired after a full day and grateful for a warm, dry place to sleep.Final word from Ginger on this 24 hours:As Sister B would say, we are blessed beyond measure.","Sassafrass Gap

I bought a new aluminum spoon and some Body Glide. Chafing can become a problem and everything is more irritating when you're walking many miles every day. We were shuttled back to Dick's Creek Gap at 1100 and said goodbye to Bob. The weather was threatening rain and we took a while to get ready to hike. While we were preparing their was a church group setting up a grill and tables with trail magic. The smell of grilled burgers was too enticing to resist so we ate lunch courtesy of angels. Ginger even got another book! Our hike was beautiful, the weather stayed clear but windy and cold at times throughout the day. We paused at Plumorchard Shelter briefly but pushed on to a secluded tenting site near a spring about 2 miles from the North Carolina border. We have the site to ourselves and this is our first tenting night of solitude. My foot is better tonight than it has been at any time on the trail.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557443,"From Fatboy:We crossed the Georgia-North Carolina border today. It was fun but also for me had the feeling of a finish line too. There were lots of hard climbs after that milestone and way more rocks than I enjoyed. Each sharp rock seems to have my name on it with a picture of how many stitches it would take to close my skull back up. We had heard that Muskrat Creek Shelter was something of a palace from a crazy skinny dude who was running on the trail while training for a 100-mile ultra marathon. We heard the Three Stooges and their obnoxious music before we even saw Muskrat Creek Shelter. The Stooges were all getting high and talking really loud. One even was bragging about being so high that he didn't remember climbing Blood Mountain and how he needed a guide to get down.   I try to practice love and tolerance but these boors were too much to take so we refilled our water bottles and pushed on. We ended our day at Deep Gap at Kimsey Creek Trail. We have our solitude again and enjoyed a tasty dinner of ramen noodles and cheese. Our home made dinners are giving us horrendous gas and keeping us way too regular. It isn't an inconvenience to go to the bathroom 3 times a day at home but it sucks to do that when you have to hike off the trail with your little shovel and pack of TP! I had a challenging time hanging the bear can tonight. Either the branches were too high, dead or too skinny. I even lost my rock bag after it got stuck up in a tree. I ended up hanging the bag about 8 feet up on an old downed tree.   My only hope is a bear will be laughing so hard at my ineptitude that he'll have mercy and leave our food alone. We have a warm, dry tent and each other. I'm grateful beyond words.From Ginger:So many photos to load! Sprint is NOT the provider of choice out here. We rarely have cell phone service, so we're getting the off-the-grid experience we expected/hoped for, but I'd like to be able to fire off an occasional text message (Jenny Snyder, we reached your beloved home state!) and post new photos (just wait until I can show you Nathan's outdoor kitchen and some of the things coming out of it!). The visuals will have to wait for another day. Stay tuned.","Mile 76

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557444,"From Fatboy:We had a good hike today. North Carolina is surprising both of us with the frequent water availability. Little streams and springs cross the trail at all elevations. It's easy to not carry a lot of water and having a lighter pack is something that you grow to appreciate quickly. Standing Indian Mountain took us over 5000 feet but wasn't too difficult of a climb. Maybe we're getting a little better at this hiking thing. We stopped at a couple of shelters and found that some friends, (Tarzan, Squirrel, and Hawk) are only 2 days ahead of us. It would be nice to see them again and I'm hopeful we catch them in Franklin. The trail today passed through a lot of areas that were burned in the forest fires last year. Some of the vegetation suffered badly but the rhododendron seems indestructible. We ended our day at Carter Gap Shelter. There was a nice group of people there and we even talked with another guy in recovery. He's walking the trail and his wife is traveling along the route being a trail angel. There is such a diverse group of individuals from all over the world who are doing this strange pilgrimage. This shelter didn't have bear cables or a bear box so we had to hang our food and all aromatic items in a tree. Usually this isn't a problem and I was prepared to do this but I'd lost my rock bag (the little bag you put a rock in and tie to your length of paracord to make a heaving line) so I tried a fist size rock to the line instead. Ginger goes with me to watch and help with this task. At least that's what she says. I think she's just getting some daily comic relief because there are often bouts of swearing and multiple futile tosses that just succeed in tearing dead branches out of trees.   It would be funny to watch but it's damned frustrating and not my favorite activity on sore feet at the end of the day. Back to the fist-sized rock. I tried this rock quite securely to my line and launched it over a suitable branch. I also held on to the other end, which created a perfect length of pendulum for this rock to swing around and smack me right in the face. Ginger was horrified; I was left with a sore face and a bruised ego but no permanent damage. We had a nice camp fire courtesy of Big Jim and retired with the sun to a warm, dry tent. It was amazing to hike today without plantar fasciitis pain. This is good! (Except the rock to the face. I could have done without that.)","Deep Gap

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557445,"From Fatboy:It was nice to be warm enough all night. We didn't have any unexpected events and were packed up and on the trail by 0920. That's the earliest for us yet. The trail through NC continues to be pleasant and has abundant water. Our first miles were gentle and easy. The weather was finally warm enough to hike in shorts for both of us. There were some beautiful vistas and we tried to take photos but realize they will be a poor likeness of our visions. We climbed the entire trail up to Albert Mountain Fire Tower. That was incredibly difficult. There were sections that were literally like rock climbing with a heavy pack and the elevation was near a mile high. I was pausing every few yards just to be able to breathe. Ginger said it was tough for her too even though she's one of the fittest people I've ever met. We met Papa Smurf and Jimmy at the peak and we took a few photos. Papa Smurf is from Niceville, Fl. and is walking from Florida to Canada. He's an inspiration and very interesting to talk with. He understands our recovery and we seem to share ideas and interests about quite a lot and I look forward to seeing him down the trail. Jimmy is a 19 year old from Virginia who's taking some time to hike before he enlists in the Navy. He's painfully young but nice enough. He spent the evening being a nurse for a baby mouse he found beside the shelter. Mice can be a destructive curse in the shelters but he and Ginger didn't see it that way so I stayed out of it as much as possible. We all ended up together in a very new shelter and had an enjoyable evening talking about many things. The water source was a very nice stream that I even had the chance to soak my battered feet in. The water was icy cold but felt very good. There was some brief hail and I felt fortunate to not be hiking or tenting in that weather. Tomorrow we hike about 3 1/2 miles to Rock Gap and a shuttle to Franklin at 1100. I'm really looking forward to getting my body and clothes clean, eating a lot of food, re-supplying, and sleeping in a warm soft bed.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557446,"From Fatboy:The thunderstorms during the night were impressive. It was wonderful to be safely inside a very nice shelter and be dry and warm. Another very significant benefit is: we didn't have to pack and carry a wet tent. That's a major bonus. There was some mouse activity in the shelter but we didn't have any damage. We were back on the trail by 0820 and Ginger was on a mission of divine inspiration. She wanted pizza! Do not attempt to sway her from that goal unless you are prepared to lose the battle. She took off and didn't slow down until we passed the next shelter which was only a few hundred yards from Rock Gap. We waited at Rock Gap for our shuttle to the Budget Inn in Franklin and had the benefit of spending time playing with a beautiful girl Weimaraner. Ginger seemed to temporarily forget pizza and really enjoyed playing with this lovely dog. We miss our three dogs immensely and both of us spend as much time as we can interacting with the dogs we meet on the trail. Our shuttle driver was a hiker legend in Franklin and kept us entertained while educating us on our ride. We checked into a nice room and I immediately collected all of my dirty laundry and took a shower. Ginger ordered our pizza and soon after I felt clean enough to not offend a goat again we were eating pizza and drinking cold sodas. I didn't have ANY clean clothes to put on so Ginger did laundry while I lounged in bed catching up on emails, text messages, and Facebook posts. Did I ever mention that I won the marriage lottery? Ginger is beautiful, strong, sexy, brilliant, and the most generous friend any man could ever wish for. EVER. After clean clothes were available, I dressed and helped fold laundry while Ginger showered. We walked around Franklin, had coffee, and checked out a few stores. I found a sushi restaurant on Yelp and became obsessed with having sushi for dinner. We usually have sushi every Wednesday at home and their menu was enticing. We walked about a mile to the sushi place only to discover a sign saying they were closed every Wednesday in March. I was unhappy but realized that didn't hurt anyone but me and we started the walk back to the inn. We ended up at a pizza type sandwich shop that had wonderful salads and grilled sandwiches. We'll have sushi tomorrow night. We walked back to our room and had coffees and got to bed early because we have to meet the shuttle at 0715 to go to a local church which provides trail magic free breakfasts to through hikers. Life is good.Random trail wisdom:1. Your hike will be safer and less painful if you learn to use trekking poles.2. On any surface other than dry, flat ground, always have three points of contact with the ground. Two feet and one pole or two poles and one foot are preferred. I tried the two poles and one butt a few times and I didn't really like it much. 3. Having ten intact toenails is not an absolute requirement.4. Take your shoes and socks off as often as you can. Dry feet are happy and healthy.5. Take time to enjoy your hike. Today is the last chance you'll ever have to live this day.","Long Branch shelter

We were met with the unmistakable smell of frying bacon when we entered the church. A very friendly group of people met us and directed us through a serving line where we were provided with plates of pancakes and bacon. They also served fresh fruit, fruit juice, coffee, muffins, and homemade apple and pumpkin butter. We were seated at round tables and offered as much food as we could eat. I estimate there were 50 hikers. Each table had envelopes with stationery provided and our pictures were taken as we ate. The lady who seemed to be the organizer told us that this church had been doing this for ten years and there were large banners which were covered with signatures and drawings in crayon for each year hanging on the walls. We were asked to sign the banners and keep them informed of our progress on our hike. Our photos were printed and we were offered the opportunity to address a note to a friend and include our photos and they would provide the postage and take care of mailing our notes. The associate pastor gave a very brief testimony and then sat with our table for his breakfast. I was so moved by the kindness of these people that I had tears in my eyes. They asked that we join them again tomorrow and for as long as we stayed in Franklin. I have never known a town with such a friendly atmosphere. The van delivered us back to our lodging and Ginger and I packed up to check out and move to a Choice Hotel because we get credit toward rewards of free lodging. We walked across town and stopped at a little coffee shop where three seniors were working on puzzles or computers. The lady serving our coffee was delightful and gave us homemade brownies and candy to go with our coffee. More super friendly folks. We shopped at the dollar store for food and other resupply items then began our trek to our next lodging. I completely underestimated how far we had to travel and we seemed to walk for an hour along limited access highways before we checked in to our new room. I was exhausted and my foot pain had returned. We did meet with Papa Smurf again and it was good to see him. We also met with this interesting shuttle driver who is 90 and a WWII vet. He was a great old guy and entertained us with stories of his wife and children. He shuttles hikers around Franklin for free and uses any donations to buy hikers lunches. This town is crazy hiker friendly. We rested in our room for a while, bathed, etc., until time for dinner. We called for a shuttle to take us for sushi and met the lovely Beverly. She says she's a courtesy driver and refuses any payment for her services. She recommended a great Asian buffet which served sushi and made sure we had discount coupons for our dinners. This buffet was next to Wal-Mart and we were able to buy Ginger's favorite protein bars there. We called Beverly and she picked us up and returned us to our hotel. Ginger bought her flowers in Wal-Mart and she seemed very pleased with the token of appreciation.   We plan to return to the trail in the morning but I can't imagine we'll ever find a community as welcoming and kind as Franklin has been.

I think I favored my right foot so much from plantar fasciitis pain that I stressed my left knee. This tape and ibuprofen are making my journey much less painful. Ginger sleeps well no matter where we are. That's her super-power. We had breakfast in our hotel and started a conversation with another hotel guest. He is a boat captain and had a lot of interesting stories about living near the AT and his hiking experiences. Ginger spent a while updating our Trail Journal website and I returned to the room to pack and arrange a shuttle. Our shuttle driver, David, was 90 year old WWII vet and a very interesting man. We took pictures together and he said he would follow our journey. The hike today was very enjoyable and not very strenuous. We met Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet and found we were all planning to stop today at Siler Bald Shelter. When we arrived at the shelter we discovered Pegleg was here.

It's from Emily Dickinson:“Hope is the thing with feathers -That perches in the soul -And sings the tune without the words -And never stops - at all - ...""Another memorable Dickinson one for me starts like this:""There is no frigate like a bookTo take us lands away ...""I first read the Frigate poem in high school.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559720,"Sleeping in a shelter is a challenge. Someone is always snoring or farting or rolling around in their sleeping bag. No one tries to be rude but it's more togetherness than most of us want. Mice are a problem too. They're the permanent residents and we are the transients. Pegleg left a plastic bottle that she'd made tea in standing upright open at her feet in the shelter. I heard this strange thumping noise repeating throughout the night but managed to sleep some. Around 0600 the noise intensified and I had to turn on my headlamp to see what it was. A mouse had gotten into PegLeg's open bottle and was jumping against the inside of the bottle trying to get out. Everyone in the shelter was awake by now and PegLeg started shouting to get rid of it (she's a retired US Marine but is afraid of mice?!) and Ginger (who's the world's biggest bleeding heart for animals) is telling me to let it out and don't hurt it. I tried shaking it out, slinging it out, even bashing the bottle on the table leg, but the damn thing wouldn't come out of the bottle. I eventually just tossed the bottle away from the shelter and laid back down. PegLeg started telling us how she thought she could eat one of us, she called it ass jerky, before she could eat a mouse. I was laughing too much to go back to sleep so we all got up. We said goodbye to PegLeg because she was leaving the trail to go to Jamaica with her family. We had breakfast, packed up, and left the shelter to head North. The trail climbed up from the shelter and we were sweating and out of breath very quickly. Hiking seemed harder today and the elevation hovered around 5000 ft. I guess that saps more strength from me than I realized. We stopped for lunch in a little meadow and I found some wild onions. Ginger tasted then and seemed happy with the idea of eating wild food. She's always interested in learning about the woods and excited with new things. It makes the hard walk worth it to see her joy. We were treated to trail magic near Wayah Bald Tower. Sandals and Snail, a couple from Greenville, SC. had set up in the parking area and had Coke, Gatorade, fruit, and doughnuts. They even brought lawn chairs for us! The treat of sitting in a soft chair with back support is incredible. If you get a donut and a cold drink too it's almost indescribable. We stayed a while and enjoyed the magic. We passed by the tower through an area that was fire damaged. It will take a while for the trail to recover. The shelter we sought was only about a mile away but it was all downhill and was very painful for me. We found a quiet place for our tent, set up, made dinner and retired for the day. Tomorrow we're in a real bed after a real meal and a hot shower. I can't wait.There were two young women in the shelter who had passed us earlier in the day. Bruce Willis (""because I'm a Diehard when making ascents"") and her younger sister, Nemo. The conversation usually includes where you're from and something about who you're hiking with for pairs. Ginger and I have joked for years about our age difference. She's almost 17 years younger and looks even younger than that because she's very athletic and just a very natural beauty who doesn't need makeup. I was looking every bit of my age at this time and Bruce finally asked the question I've been waiting for: Is Ginger my daughter? I laughed and answered that she's my wife. It was hilarious even though Bruce was embarrassed. That was priceless!","Siler Bald shelter, NC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559721,"From Fatboy:It rained a lot during the night. We had our tent set up on a reasonably flat site but there was no vegetation or leaves on the site. The mud splashed up on the side of the tent inside the vestibule and my crocs were full of mud too. That's not really the way I like to start my day but at least it wasn't below freezing. I put on all clean clothes. Clean socks feel amazing when your feet are as battered as mine are. The big struggle is to put knee length compression socks on when you're a stiff, sore 60 year old who's ~6'2"""" tall in a tent that you barely have enough overhead room to sit up in. Ginger learned the hard way to just stay as low as possible to avoid flying elbows. I retrieved the bear canister from the tree. We were influenced to buy a lot of food in Franklin because we were told that the Nantahala Outdoor Center wasn't a good place to resupply. We've been hiking for two days and still can't get all of our food in the can. I'm carrying way too much food! I made coffee and oatmeal as usual while Ginger packed our camp. By now our division of chores is pretty much set and we just get it done. We were on our way as the last people from camp, again. I'm slow in the morning but we always end up at the same place as most everyone else at the end of the day. The early part of our hike today was reasonably easy, not too many rocks and no severe or long elevation changes. Our only issue was rain. We had our rain gear on several times because it would begin to rain. We'd hike a short distance and then the sun would come out and make the rain gear into a sauna suit. I wear a poncho, so it's not too bad, but Ginger wears a full rain suit and steams in the sun. Lunch was at a secluded meadow and very pleasant. We began our last push to Tellico Gap knowing that it was a very long descent. Those are the worst for my feet and knees. I'm taped up to support both knees but it isn't enough. As I tire my knees become more unstable and it's frustrating to not be sure my leg isn't going to buckle every few minutes. Knee braces are in my very near future. We did surprise two turkeys near the trail. They make a lot of noise when they exit an area in a panic. I stumbled in to Tellico Gap and were met by Steve, the owner of Nantahala Mountain Lodge. I'd read about this lodge, which is located in Aquone, and made sure we visited. Steve built the lodge and cabins while living in a tent for several years. He's a thru-hiker and tells a funny story about making the announcement to his pals about hiking the AT during a session with a bottle of scotch. Steve (Wiggie) delivered us to a beautiful log lodge where we were met by Maggie, Steve's wife. We were directed to the mud room to store all of our hiker gear and collect our dirty clothes. No hiker gear or clothing are allowed in the lodge! We were ushered to showers and given clean clothes and socks to wear while in the lodge. This is the most beautiful lodge I've ever seen. There are natural wood tables and cabinets throughout and we discovered they were made by Steve. Our room was gorgeous with a giant rustic bed and beautiful decorating. Maggie washed all of our filthy clothes and informed us that dinner was at 1700. We relaxed in the lodge until dinner. We were served a delicious cream soup, steamed vegetables, yams, and a hearty pulled pork in gravy dish. I drank many glasses of Gatorade and blueberry pie with whipped cream for dessert. We were both quite full but did manage to buy some snacks for later. The hiker hunger is not a myth. I can eat until I feel stuffed and walk across the room and want more food. I know I've lost over 10 pounds in only the first 100 miles! We retired to our room to rest and hopefully let some healing work on my legs. What a wonderful day!From Ginger:The note I made in our guidebook about Nantahala Mountain Lodge is ""cabin and wood as art."" Everything in eyesight is beautifully crafted. It's the kind of dream cabin I can see creating for one's own enjoyment. It's hard to believe they are willing to share it with others! Steve and Maggie have been married more than 46 years, I believe they said. I'm grateful to be around another married couple who clearly work well together and seem to respect each other's strengths. I bet some are quite distinct and others overlap. It really seems to work for them. Steve explained how things would work when we arrived at the lodge, but thankfully Maggie was there to then guide us through it. The process keeps the accommodations fresh and very clean, which is important for other thru-hikers AND non-hiking guests. I was glad Maggie led us to different showers so Nathan and I could clean up simultaneously. It allows you to literally leave the trail world at the door and begin to recover and restore.","Wayah Bald Shelter, NC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559722,"From Fatboy:We took a zero today. This lodge is beautiful and way too comfortable. We arranged for a shuttle to take us to Franklin. Beverly had shuttled us before and said she would be along to pick us up after 1300. It's a 25 minute drive to the town so I thought we might get lunch there and I just snacked. Beverly arrived after 1600 and we were starved. We were delivered to Outdoor 76 for a shoe-fitting for Fatboy. The staff at this store take shoes to a whole new level. Corey worked with me for over an hour and I was fit with the shoes I should have started this trail with. Ginger got new shoes too after witnessing the care and detail that were required for this process. We spent lots of $$ but if the result is walking without pain, it's worth it. We left the store at 1930 and walked a few doors away to a terrific restaurant, accompanied by Rob, a section hiker also staying at Nantahala Mountain Lodge. The food was great and Ginger scored the biggest hit with her Carolina Burger. A half pound burger with pulled pork, cole slaw, and a berry barbecue sauce. She let me taste it and it was delicious. She ate the whole thing and we even had dessert. Rob was kind enough to give us a ride back to our lodging. We didn't get to our room until after 2200 and we were exhausted.","Nantahala Mountain Lodge

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559726,"From Fatboy:We decided to flip flop, slackpack, SOBO (southbound), from Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) to Telico Gap today. We had breakfast at the Lodge and then loaded into the Subaru for a ride to the NOC. The roads in this area are very narrow and tortuous. If you drive them every day this must be normal. If you live in Corpus Christi, Texas, where all of the roads are flat, straight, and wide, it's similar to riding a rollercoaster with other vehicles playing chicken with you all the time. If I said the experience was thrilling and terrifying in equal parts, that would be accurate. We actually had a shuttle driver in Franklin who turned into oncoming traffic from a stop light on a divided highway at night. I was riding shotgun and Ginger was in the back seat. I stated as calmly as possible: Make a U-turn now. The driver made the turn and we all rode down the road happy to still be alive. It made me much less concerned about bears.Our slackpack started on a great note. Our packs weighed about 5# each and we both had brand new, comfortable shoes. The hike was almost all up hill which is much less painful than down hill on my knees. We left the NOC and headed south. That was kind of fun because we met quite a few people that we'd seen on the trail and Fatboy was almost giddy with being able to hike without pain. That lasted until about noon. After a couple of short descents, Fatboy's knees turned to jelly again and his feet returned to pulsating pain with every step. We did ascend Wesser Bald Tower and were treated to spectacular views and a reunion with Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet. Fatboy hobbled down to Telico and Steve drove us back to the lodge.Dinner was excellent and enjoying a hot shower and a soft bed after a painful day hiking was a special treat. Papa Smurf and Henry The Viet Nam Vet are staying at the lodge too now and we all shared stories and fellowship after dinner. The day started on a high, passed through a low, and ended on a high. Kinda like some stretches on this trail through the mountains.From Ginger:I got to reattach my American flag charm -- a gift offered from a Recovery friend's Red Wing boot -- to my new boot. I did it in the car, seated next to Vietnam Vet. Decided that was fitting, since the flag was from a vet who survived the same war.Nathan and I often have different experiences, mentally and or physically, on the trail. Sometimes we don't know it until we're checking in with each other in the evening. I didn't realize he was still suffering, even with the boost from new shoes. I know, however, that my elation showed. I couldn't stop smiling. And, to date, I've had my favorite Trail experience. We climbed a very steep section (remember, going SOBO today) up to what's called the Jumpoff. You don't know you're there until after some hand-over-hand, creative pole digging and lifting, your head pops up and you pull yourself into a view that literally took my breath away. I was already panting, and taking in that vista nearly made me sob. THIS is what I came to see. To be surrounded by. To be inspired by. To witness that God created and it's just waiting there for us to appreciate if we dare. To use the word ""awesome"" or ""amazing"" doesn't cover it. Truly a spiritual moment for me.","NOC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559727,"From Fatboy:We decided to leave the lodge for good this morning and resume our NOBO journey from the NOC. We absolutely enjoyed Maggie and Steve (Wiggy) Bennett and were treated to a wonderful experience staying with them. The lodge is filled with artistic wooden furniture and cabinetry that Steve made and we had quite fun conversations about art, the military, the government and hiking. (From Ginger: We also flipped through the 2016 Hiker Yearbook they had. We found Sandals and Snail in it!) Ginger and I both talked about a return visit with family or on a Harley ride.We had our second breakfast at the NOC restaurant and were joined by Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet. These friends are wonderful companions and we made reservations to be at Fontana the same nights soon. This is the best part of hiking. The people we've met are incredibly friendly and open and I believe we're making some lifelong friends. We shipped our old boots home and started hiking North. Our goal was the first shelter only about 7 miles away but almost a constant climb. IT WAS A CLIMB! Water wasn't available at all of the marked locations but we always had enough. We met lots of hikers who were headed to the same shelter and had fun playing with a couple of happy dogs too! We arrived at our destination after 1700 and we were both exhausted. We set up our tent, prepared dinner, hung the bear can, and were in bed by 2030. Fatboy's feet and knees held up better today so maybe he's going to be ok. This is the hardest physical challenge either of us has ever had but we're doing it together and loving each other more fully in the journey.","NOC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559728,"From Fatboy:We left the shelter after our usual morning routine. The only variation from usual was Ginger went to retrieve the bear can. She'd helped hang the thing the night before and watched me gracefully fall on my ass in the process. I haven't fallen hard or injured myself from the falls yet. I just periodically lose my footing and drop. I don't usually even try to catch myself because I know that's a recipe for a broken wrist with all of the weight I carry in my upper body. The trail resumed climbing. Resumed climbing! Our goal was the next shelter which was 9.1 miles away. We started the day optimistic but it was a tough hike. Only later did we discover that we were hiking ""Jacob's Ladder"" which is one of the more notorious sections of the trail. I'm glad I didn't know it from the beginning because I believe I would have been discouraged.We passed Papa Smurf as he slackpacked SOBO and he was in good spirits and having fun. Later we met Tequila Sunshine alone and she was struggling. This trail identifies and exploits any weakness you have. My feet are less an issue than before but she and I both have knee problems. She was all taped up (just like me) and had knee bands on both legs. The experience of planting your foot only to have your knee buckle is frustrating and becomes quite painful after repeated events as your knees swell and you get tired. Chafing is another constant companion. I started the trail using Vaseline between my thighs but discovered a better alternative in a product called Body Glide. This stuff helps skin slide without irritation and doesn't leave a greasy residue. I use it every day. We paused at a glorious road crossing and were treated to trail magic by Ramble On. He has thru hiked the AT twice (1996 and 2009) and was fun to talk to. He gave us chocolate covered Twinkies. They were delicious and a nauseated Ginger even ate one. I refilled our water supply from a source down an abandoned road a short walk away. It was tempting to camp near the water source because it was flat and secluded with a piped stream which made filling water bottles very easy. We decided to push on the last 2.6 miles but Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet went to camp by the water source. I was almost jealous! We made the rest of the climb (here's where we started Jacob's Ladder) to the shelter and found another tent site on a slope. Our dinner was a delicious combination of bouillon, Stove Top stuffing, summer sausage, and cheddar cheese. It really was quite good and very filling. We placed everything with a scent in the bear can and I tied it to a small tree up-slope from our camp, hoping that if a critter tried to get into it it would roll down hill toward us instead of away from us. I hope it works.","Sassafrass Gap shelter, NC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559729,"From Fatboy:There was a big storm during the night with lots of lightning and rain. Our tent was set on a slope so we spent all night sliding to the bottom and my feet were wet from being pressed against the tent wall. The rain let up around sunrise and we thought about getting up but it started raining hard again and we decided to wait until it quit. That was a great choice! When we awoke again it was sunny but cold. Ginger retrieved the bear can and we began our routine. I started heating water but the fuel canister ran out within a few minutes so we had cool coffee and cold oatmeal. It wasn't ideal but we at least had food. Our destination was only about 6 miles to the next shelter and the terrain was reasonable. I felt stronger than any day before on this journey and we both were busy noticing the signs of impending spring. There were violets and many green plants sprouting along the forest floor as well as a sprinkling of red buds that fell from the oak trees. Spring and the resurgence of plants from winter dormancy has always seemed like a miracle to me and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it anew through my wife's eyes. We discussed how good it would be to spend the night in a shelter on a flat surface and wondered where some of our friends were. We reached Cable Gap Shelter around 1530 and were the only ones there. We were soon joined by Tequila Sunshine, Happy Feet, Papa Smurf, and Viet Nam Vet. These were the friends we were hoping to meet and we all stopped together. That's real trail magic! I made my first campfire with the help of others gathering wood and we had dinner. As we were sitting in the shelter a man came hiking down the trail carrying a red box. If you've been on trail for a few weeks there's no mistaking a pizza box. Our angel was Mustard Seed, a local man who thru-hiked the trail a few years ago and now brings in trail magic as well as supporting a medical mission in Honduras. The pizzas and sodas were delicious and we all had pictures together. I've run out of superlatives to describe the feeling of community on the trail. I'm grateful every day for every kindness from friends and strangers. Tomorrow we hike ~6 miles to Fontana and a shower, bed, and big meals. Life is good.From Ginger:Here is the link to Mustard Seed's site, which will tell you more about his mission:http://www.fobf.org/hikingforhope
One of our travel mates took a tumble. Nathan pounced to take care of the situation: a knee bent sideways and backward as the person slid in the mud. Nathan whipped out the ace wrap we're carrying in the first aid kit, wrapped the knee carefully and suggested the hiker keep that knee elevated overnight. Luckily, it was already hiker midnight. We were all retreating to our beds. Even if it turns out to be more scary than injurious, it could be any one of us, with any step. When people ask what's in his aid kit, as a medical professional, he'll share a few things, then laugh and say that his most effective gear is ""up here,"" tapping at his temple. I was proud of Nathan's reaction and his skill. And, as always, to be with him.","Brown Fork Gap shelter, NC

The sunrise in this area can be delayed depending on which side of the mountain you're camped on. It was still pretty dark so I dawdled in bed. We didn't have a tent to break down or a bear can to get out of a tree so why rush? We were the last people out of camp. Again! We only had a 5.5 mile hike to the Fontana Dam Visitor center and the terrain profile looked fairly easy so we were counting on an easy day. Here's a hint. Don't underestimate Ginger's motivation to get to nachos! She set out in the lead and rarely looked back. She was moving faster than any day on the trail so far and the weather was perfect. We made the trip in less than 3 hours. This particular section brings Fontana Dam into view a long time before you get to it. A LONG TIME.   We met with Tequila Sunshine, Happy Feet, and Viet Nam Vet at the marina and caught the shuttle to the lodge. Check-in was smooth and we moved our stuff to a beautiful room. I checked the hiker box and scored an almost full fuel canister and some cookies. We met Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet in the restaurant and Ginger got her nachos. My burger was delicious and the soda took care of my dehydration from Ginger's forced March. We returned to our room for showers and a nap after buying a few supplies. The afternoon was spent lying in bed and relishing feeling clean, warm, and dry. Dinner was at the lodge restaurant and we were ready for bed by 2130. I'm looking forward to a zero tomorrow. Laundry, food, coffee, naps, and recuperation. My knee support straps arrived and I hope they make the upcoming downhill sections less painful.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559731,"From Fatboy:Lying in bed reading and writing was the order of the day for me. My right foot is battered and every step hurts. I promised Ginger I would follow her anywhere, and I will, but I need rest and time for healing. I've removed all of the KT tape from my knees and right foot to give my skin a break. My skin feels good but without the tape support a lot of the pain from my plantar fasciitis returns. I hobble like a really old man and going down stairs requires very gentle tread. It will get better but it'll take time too. Ginger did our laundry so all of our clothes smell good temporarily. The materials our clothing are made of get clean and dry quickly but also smell funky after any exertion that creates moisture. After this trip I'm going to wear nothing but cotton for a month! I am relishing lying in bed drinking coffee with Ginger. We have a routine of bringing one another coffee in bed every morning when we're at home that I miss on the trail. Like many things (running water, showers, clean sheets, food on real plates, etc.) because we've been without those luxuries we cherish them more now.We said goodbye to our friends Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet. Tequila had developed a foot problem that required medical care so she was traveling to Atlanta. They will return to the trail when she's able but I'm going to miss them. Papa Smurf and Viet Nam Vet are leaving the trail tomorrow. We will keep in touch but the laughter and camaraderie will be missed too.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559732,"From Fatboy:It was raining hard when we woke up. A shuttle driver we met early on in this adventure told us some things that we're trying to live by. He said: Never carry water to water. Never carry food to food. Never leave a town in the rain. We're getting better with his advice about water; we aren't doing well so far with judging food. We always leave town with way too much. We are golden on his advice about rain. It takes virtually nothing more than a heavy dew to convince me to stay in a room with clean sheets, a shower, a flush toilet, and a locking door. I still love my creature comforts! So we stayed another day and were fortunate to have made that choice. It stormed and thundered very heavily until late morning. The power was out in the lodge but we were safe and dry. It also gave me one last chance at a 1/2 pound burger and we were able to ship a box of stuff home that we didn't want to throw away or donate but also didn't want to carry any more.

It was a very pleasant place to rest and restore and it would be nice to come back. We caught the shuttle back to the place we were picked up two days ago and we began climbing. When you're leaving a lake which was formed by damming a river any way you go you must go up. For some reason today seemed like a harder hike than we expected. Maybe our packs were too heavy from extra food or maybe it was something else. We talked to other hikers today and discovered our feelings weren't unique to us. Today was just a hard hike. The weather was beautiful and walking across the dam was a kick. We met a hiker named Foghat who I learned is also 60. When he told me his name I immediately replied Slow Ride. We are products of the same age. He is from New Hampshire and is hiking for his son who was a Marine who died under very unfortunate circumstances not related to the military. Foghat had a small brass cylinder attached to his pack strap which I think had some of his son's ashes inside. I can't imagine the pain of losing my son but I offered my regrets for his loss and we hiked on. We ended our hike after about 7 miles and camped at one of the few approved tenting sites within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The tent site was level for a change which was nice because we're both getting tired of sliding down to the foot of the tent all night. The water source was convenient and they had bear cables. The only thing missing was a privy but we'll make do. Tomorrow will be day two in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and we're restricted to 8 for a thru hiker passage. We've tried to arrange a stay in Gatlinburg, TN, for this coming weekend but everything we've tried has either been fully booked or very expensive.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559735,"From Fatboy:We were out of camp by 0900. We were hiking strong and the terrain was reasonably forgiving. Then it began to rain. And it got cold and windy. And it was miserable. We made it to Mollies Ridge Shelter and found respite from the weather and we decided to stay. The shelter had a tarp rigged to block the wind and it was wonderful to get warm and dry. We had some boillion and tried to warm up. Ginger takes such good care of me. I had hiked without stopping to put on rain gear and I got chilled. Ginger crawled in the sleeping bag and warmed me up and I took a nap. Ginger also hung all of my wet clothes outside after the rain stopped and took the best care of me. I don't know how anyone can do this by themselves. I am so blessed to have Ginger in my life every day.As the day wore on I became less and less enamored with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and their policies. The policy in this park is that thru-hikers must purchase a permit to walk through the park and your transit of the park must be completed within 8 days. You must stay in the shelters or approved tenting area (there's only one in the whole park.) If the shelter is full you can tent next to the shelter. SECTION HIKERS HAVE PRIORITY IN SHELTERS. This last rule can create more difficulties than I really want on this journey. We stopped at Mollies Ridge Shelter early in the day and the shelter gradually filled throughout the afternoon. The weather continued to be windy, wet, and very cold. The togetherness with this group began to cause small conflicts. A woman (shrew) who claimed to be celebrating her 20th anniversary constantly was unpleasant to her husband and generally was a pain in the ass. The topper of the evening was a man who arrived and immediately claimed section hiker status and needed space for 5. This wasn't a popular way to say hello to the group and almost got a rise from me. I didn't engage him in conversation and probably shouldn't. He had an accent that I think I could identify and it certainly wasn't Texan or local. I admit my prejudices and try my best to be tolerant but I hope I don't run in to many more of this type as we travel north. I hope to leave the Smokies as soon as possible. It's an amazing natural resource but I doubt I'll ever hike here again. Their policies create an environment that's a setup for a bad experience.","Birch Spring Gap campground

The ground was covered with several inches of snow and it promised to be a better day. There was a shelter about three miles away that was reported to be an easy hike. As we hiked, the weather warmed enough that the trail slowly became a muddy slush track. My shoes aren't waterproof but I had plastic grocery bags over my socks so I thought I would be ok. The first three miles went well and we stopped to adjust clothing layers and have lunch. When we left there was a gradual climb and the muddy slush kept getting deeper. I sprung a leak in both shoes so I was hiking on cold, wet feet and my spirits began to sink. I don't like to be dirty and I really detest being cold, wet, dirty and hungry. We came to the next shelter and I stripped off my wet socks and the KT Tape that's holding my right foot together. It felt good to have dry feet but any time I'm not taped I can barely walk. We were joined by enough hikers to fill the shelter and we had another fire. I did manage to dry my socks by putting them on a stick and holding them over the fire. Yes, I did burn a big hole in one but I wear two layers of socks anyway so it is still serviceable. I still have trouble staying warm but the weather is supposed to get warmer. We have 27 miles to our next road crossing for resupply and we have about 2 1/2 days of food left so tomorrow we continue north.From Ginger:We were joined by Nick the Ridge Runner for a second night, this time in a new shelter. For some reason, I felt better having him there. He doesn't have the enforcement authority that a park ranger does, but his presence and pointed questions or directions to some was comforting. He clearly cares about people's safety and the welfare of the animals in this park, and the park itself. We learned about privy maintenance and a ""fecal cone."" You can imagine the complications brought on my freezing temps and snow for a typically moldering privy!At Spence Field this night were Shane and Carson again, which was nice. We also got to meet Phoenix (see Billy Mitchell's websites and videos for cancer and Hep C awareness), Tiny Tim, Zeus, etc. They built a terrific fire. I'm going to do that myself one day.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559740,"From Fatboy:We hiked 11.8 miles today. There were some difficult ascents and the trail was frozen in the morning. I covered my taped, double-socked, battered feet with Mylar shopping bags before I put on my frozen, mud-encrusted shoes. The feeling of putting on frozen shoes to walk in frozen slush for many miles is something that must be experienced to fully understand. When you add the entertainment of slipping and sliding, sometimes falling, it makes for an exhausting day. 
We did experience some amazing views and even saw a snow maiden that was made by some hikers. Hikers are overwhelmingly young males so she had very prominent breasts. Ginger posed nicely with her and I have a cute picture to record the memory. 
I had found a hiking stick along the trail that I recognized as belonging to Shane. This stick still had the rubber wristband around it that I knew he'd received as trail magic. I picked it up and Ginger strapped it to the back of my pack with the stick projecting above my head for a couple of feet. It was hilarious-looking and presented a new challenge since I often have to duck anyway to avoid low branches. This lead to conversations with me referring to my ""antenna"" and references to old TV shows like My Favorite Martian. It helped to relieve some of the pain and made the trail miles more fun. The best part was seeing the smile on Shane's face when he was reunited with his hiking staff.
We made it to Silers Bald Shelter by around 1830 and the shelter was full so we set up our tent near the shelter as per the guidelines. I was cold and exhausted but Ginger got our water, set up our sleeping mats, and generally did everything possible to make the night as easy for me as possible. She is a wonderful best friend and wife and I love spending my days with her. This trip would be impossible for me on my own. We ate our Ramen and noodle dish with some kind of fruit and nut mix for dessert and went to bed. Our sleeping bag is a double so we sleep together, is rated for 15 degrees and we have bag liners. We sleep in long johns and fleece and down jackets, with hats too. I was frozen all night. I could only lie flat on my back because of hamstring cramps and I shivered all night. I don't know how cold it was but the ground was frozen. I can verify that the ground was frozen because this shelter doesn't have a privy. Rather, it has a sign pointing down a hill saying ""privy area."" I can attest that, again, unless you've walked down an icy embankment to dig a cathode in the snowy, frozen ground to answer the call of nature you don't understand how joyous an experience it is to start your day. (It's barbaric. I believe the inventor of indoor plumbing and flush toilets should be revered as a saint.)
From Ginger:
The snow maiden was was near Rocky Top. Then at Thunderhead Mountain (5527 feet), we were able to get a rare phone call out! I fell for the first time. Nearly 200 miles in, so I was probably due. It was actually 1.5 times. The miles to Derrick Knob shelter, which we eventually blew past, were spent with a lot of laughter, even though the six miles there seemed like 10. It was the Elusive Derrick and his missing Knob! The portion after that helped with Simon and Garfunkel songs. Nathan was so fun with his rendition of ""The Boxer,"" and I added percussion that cracked us both up. I will be happy to not see mud again for a while ...","Spence Field shelter

There was also the most fun trail magic I've seen to date. We found a tree with grocery bags hanging from the branches and some angel gifted the hikers with candy bars, crackers, donuts, and poptarts. We made it to Clingman's Dome observation tower around 1330 and were kind of resting in the grass before going up. There were lots of non-hikers milling about and they looked so much different from us. They were clean and we're wearing denim and cotton t-shirts. They even looked well fed and smelled good too! I didn't notice anyone staring at us but I wouldn't have blamed them for it. We were muddy, stained, walked with a very obvious painful gait, and smelled really bad. I tried hard not to offend anyone. As Ginger and I approached the tower ramp a lady in a bright chartreuse t-shirt asked me if we were thru hikers. I don't remember my exact response but I think I apologized for my scent. She said it was because we were wearing gaiters over our lower pant legs. I did verify her guess and she asked me what we were doing today. When I told her we were trying to find a way into Gatlinburg she replied that she would take us. Gatlinburg is about 20 miles from Clingman's Dome so this was a significant gift. Ginger and I were both very grateful and I was moved to tears. Without this angel's gift we would have had about another 6 miles of hiking and likely had to hitch hike into Gatlinburg. It turns out that her companion had thru hiked in 2004 and she was hoping to hike some sections after she's fully recovered from her second knee replacement. We were delivered right to the door of our hotel and had some photos with our latest angels. As a parting gift these lovely people gave us their contact information and offered us a ride and a place to stay when we get nearer his property further north in Tennessee. I never imagined I would be treated with such kindness from strangers or that I would be blessed with such a wonderful wife. My life is amazing.
From Ginger:
I have to acknowledge a rocky start to the day. Nathan detects it when I'm quiet, and he gives me the space I need. He never presses. What a partner.
I was having trouble practicing love and tolerance for all the pot-smoking that goes on out here ... and its obvious effect on people's demeanor, actions, conversations. Anyway, we paused on the trail, and I restarted my day. Prayer answered: clearer mind.
We hiked through a bit of mud and a ton of snow uphill. I felt energized by the sun's occasional streams through the dense pines here. This section was truly wooded. And thick. We basically marched up a frozen slalom run. I like the uphills. I imagine my individual muscles working, propelling me forward. It's another workout.
We stopped at what turned out to be false summit No. 1 or 2 (searching for Clingman's Dome), had lunch and were able to make a hotel reservation in Gatlinburg. What a difference a day makes. We were told it would be impossible (or super expensive) to stay in Gatlinburg on Saturday night. And to get a ride from Clingman's Dome. Well, we got to Gatlinburg a day later, so things cleared out, and all I can say about the ride down is that's God's grace. I think I owe the Smokies an apology. They just showed me heaven here on Earth. As if Nathan surviving the night before wasn't generous enough. We are both blessed beyond measure.","Silers Bald shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559743,"From Fatboy:Gatlinburg, Tennessee and staying at the Motel 6. This is a fun little town and everything is fairly easy to walk to or ride public transportation to. Be suspicious of anyone saying this who has just hiked 200 miles to get here. Their perception may be slightly skewed.Today was a lazy day. We had a big breakfast at Flapjacks and went to the Nantahala Outdoor Center outfitters to buy some new socks for Fatboy because he burned a big hole in his other socks while trying to dry them after a day of wading through muddy slush at 5000+ feet elevation. Ginger needed some socks and some new hiking pants because she walked off most of her butt before we left Georgia and her shirts all stretched too. I wonder how that happened? We called multiple people while trying to arrange for a ride back to Clingman's Dome too. Finally we found a man affiliated with the First Baptist Church who gives hikers free transportation back to the trail. You have to love the people of these communities. There are a lot of people who live their faith in very quiet ways without fanfare or expectation. We ate corn dogs for lunch and they were delicious! There can be so much joy in simple food without warning labels or nutrition breakdown information if you just let yourself eat without guilt. We rode a shuttle bus to a real grocery store to restock our food supply. We bought enough food for five days paying extra attention to upping the calorie values of each meal and getting enough vitamins and minerals. Fatboy had a lot of trouble staying warm over the last few days at altitude and we suspect it was partly caused by poor nutrition and dehydration. I hope the all night shivering episodes are a thing of the past.
Ginger was tired after hiking around town and all of the people. It's kind of like sensory overload to be back in crowds when you've become accustomed to the quiet of the trail. Our diet had some really drastic changes over the last few meals. She stayed at the motel and Fatboy went to dinner with Foghat. It was an enjoyable way to spend the evening and we all are beginning to feel a little better after the last few days of skating on the muddy slush slalom course on frozen feet. We decided to spend one more night in Gatlinburg and even upgraded our room to include a Jacuzzi bath tomorrow night. Fatboy can barely wait to soak in a big tub with water jets pounding the soreness from his tired old body. Life is good and indoor plumbing is a miracle.","Motel 6, Gatlinburg, TN

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561023,"From Fatboy:One more day of recovery for Fatboy. A couple of hours in the Jacuzzi and ibuprofen but knees and feet continue to be problematic and make even walking to the bathroom in the hotel room very painful. KT Tape helps a lot with the foot problems but also the adhesive causes skin problems and a lot of itching. Rest and staying clean and applying steroid cream help a lot but prevent me from helping with any of the chores. Ginger is ALWAYS gracious and kind and takes care of everything. Again, I don't know how anyone could accomplish this journey alone. Ginger also took care of mailing things home we don't want to carry and went to the library to use the computer. Fatboy keeps the journal updated every day on his Kindle but Ginger uses a real computer to copy and paste these entries whenever we are in a town with access. The highlight of the day for Fatboy was spending the evening watching TV, sharing the Jacuzzi and going to bed in a clean, warm, dry place.From Ginger:Today's act of kindness from a stranger ...Aboard the trolley, we had more riders staying on the edge of Gatlinburg, so I saw more views of the fire damage. After expressing concern about the toll it took, the trolley driver pointed out to me numerous sites where businesses once stood. Parts of the town were burning on both sides of the main street. And the ones tucked into the streets a bit, removed from the thoroughfare ... those seemed to fare far worse. There is a lot of reconstruction going on. Two women who live and work in Gatlinburg commented on how good the overtime has been for them recently. They also lamented how difficult it's been for their employers to hire enough people: Many folks can't pass a drug test. We keep hearing more and more about heroin and meth use in these small towns. Many of addiction awareness posters and signs for families.Back to the benevolence shown me ... Heading to the library, I was eventually the only person on the trolley. The driver, who'd just been radioed to refuel the vehicle, dropped me at the post office, allowed me to take care of business there while he refueled, then doubled-back to the PO, picked me up and continued on the community center and library! It didn't cost me two trips. And at the trolley stop, an area Baptist minister stopped to check on me. Said he couldn't overlook the hiker attire (he was in line with me at the PO). His relative helps operate the Sevierville shuttle we'll be taking back to the trail tomorrow. Gave me his card in case we need anything before leaving town. Thank goodness either I find the Baptists, or they find me, starting in 1991 with Baylor! Lately, they remind me of our friends Carole and Trent who just moved to Amarillo. Or Joe Cook at home. Just more God winks.","Motel 6, Gatlinburg, TN

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561024,"From Fatboy:We met the 0830 shuttle to Clingman's Dome. The Baptist church of Sevierville provides the free shuttle from the NOC for hikers returning to the trail. This is just another form of trail magic that we are gifted with every day. Foghat was on the same shuttle and we started our hike together. Ginger brought snacks to give to other hikers as trail magic. It's gratifying to be on the giving end of trail magic. The hike from Clingman's Dome to Newfound Gap was about 7 miles and it was almost all down hill. Hard hiking for Fatboy. We did get trail magic from a mother and daughter at Newfound Gap. Mountain Dew to the rescue for Fatboy! We also used the public restrooms at the gap parking area and started our last 3 1/2 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. The trail was wide and generally easy but we still didn't get there early. We're slow because Fatboy can't walk fast downhill and Ginger always stays within sight. There's a big bubble of hikers that has a lot of young people. The area around the shelter has a lot of tents and groups of laughing hikers. We ate dinner and retired. After the sun went down the temperature dropped fast so we really appreciate our warm, dry tent and double sleeping bag. I'm tired but it's good to be back making progress toward our goal.From Ginger:Thru-hikers aren't the only ones milling around at stops in the Smokies. Today, we were surrounded by day hikers and short travelers at Newfound Gap. There's an unmistakable rock wall that draws lots of attention. And we were photographed like wildlife in the area! It cracked me up and made me proud. Just before Newfound Gap, we saw a group on one of Gatlinburg's wildflower pilgrimages. I so want to know what all these flowers are that we're seeing. If we come back to this area, I think that will be on the itinerary. Or I'll get yet another book (once I don't have to carry it every day).Waiting outside the public restrooms, several people stopped to chat about our packs. A couple of them were past thru-hikers, but several were people who knew nothing about it. One guy gasped at the fact that we hiked here from another state. He kept laughing and shaking his head.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561025,"From Fatboy:Our most miles in one day yet. Icewater Spring Shelter to Tricorner Knob Shelter for 12.1 miles. Somehow we got the idea that we would exit the National Park tomorrow but we were wrong, we will need to go 14.8 miles tomorrow and then about 4 miles the next day to get to Standing Bear Farm/Hostel. We have a mail drop there and also some maintenance items from Amazon such as more KT Tape and some spray benzoin to protect my skin from the tape. Our hike today was actually pretty easy. The terrain didn't include a lot of mud or steep altitude changes and we had the bonus of some of the most beautiful scenery yet. We visited Charlie's Bunion, a rock formation that is very close to the trail and offers spectacular visibility and photo opportunities. I climbed the rock and had a nice conversation with some young ladies from Canada who were section hiking as part of a leadership class. They were having a great time and we're a lot of fun to talk to. We made it to Tri-corner Knob by 1730, set up our tent, filtered water, and cooked dinner. There were several section hikers already at the shelter and we had more mature adult conversations than we've had in quite a while. There was even a hiker named Astrid, who was from Austria and was celebrating her birthday. As usual, once the sun started to go down the temperature got quite chilly and uncomfortable for us so we retired to our cozy tent. It was a beautiful day with my best friend.From Ginger:Tenting was crowded at this site, but oh, the morning sunrise!! Nathan caught a terrific photo of it that we'll need to post eventually. We could easily view it from the tent vestibule. How spoiled is that?! All I had to do was lean over Nathan, and I got to watch the sun slowly fill the horizon with orange and yellow rays. It was gorgeous. He even switched places with me in the sleeping bag so I could beam at it rising up. (And I think he got a few more winks in that way!) Once we got to the shelter, as Nathan says, we met some really cool people. We've now met enough enjoyable section hikers to totally eclipse that initial (and likely not typical) group from Mollie's Ridge shelter our first night in the Smokies. Gonna let that experience go now. Of the folks from Tri-corner, there were five women (from Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati and Carolina) who take a trip together every fall and spring. One of them was an extremely experienced hiker, Jennifer. Another actually lived in France when the U.S. military still had bases there. I'd never met someone stationed in France before! I really enjoyed talking with several people in their group that evening. We had things in common to share, but I learned things from them, too -- and not just trail wisdom. Wonderful day out here, all around. And, I have to share this from Fatboy:We haven't seen any bears yet -- and I'm happy to never see one out here. I'd rather see a moose later -- but Fatboy muses aloud (did I already document this?): ""We haven't seen any bears, but I wonder how many bears have seen us?!""","Icewater Spring shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561026,"From Fatboy:We were awake at 0600 but it was still dark and chilly so we slept until about 0700. I wish I could figure out why the sleep after the alarm is so good. We did our usual morning routine with coffee and a hot breakfast. We had a mixture of cheese and bacon grits this morning and I had a big power bar that was 650 calories by itself. It was delicious and provided the fuel I needed for our biggest mileage day yet. We did enjoy some brief conversations with other hikers before leaving the shelter but we were still moving up the trail by 0920. The contour of the hike wasn't generally too severe and we saw some beautiful vistas. The funny thing is that after a couple of days of looking at the gorgeous mountains you get a little jaded to the view. We joked about how our photos likely won't be very interesting because many of them look a lot alike. We have a lot of pictures of Ginger looking at something or standing near something but we may not be able to remember why we took that photo or where it was.We did get 14.8 miles before the sun started to go down and the shelter at Davenport Gap was full so we had to tent. That is our preference anyway as long as we aren't expecting rain. It's much quieter and more private and you don't have to contend with the mice that are at every shelter. Ginger gifted me with the opportunity for a woods style bath! I gathered some clean clothes, soap, my towel, and 2 liters of unfiltered water. I walked to a corner of three trails where I had a clear view in every direction and I stripped naked and washed my body. Being near clean after a couple of days without bathing is one of the best things I've ever experienced. The water was ice cold but I didn't care. It was glorious and one of the best gifts Ginger could ever give me. I hate being dirty. Always!We had dinner and brushed our teeth (another glorious privilege most people take for granted), hung our bear-attracting trash and food in a tree or locked it up in our bear can, and retired to our comfy tent. It was a spectacular but hard day and tomorrow we leave the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Life is very good.From Ginger:Fatboy says I gifted him. He's too generous. I just took care of the usual stuff and allowed him the decency of a bath. I think we'll enjoy more of those outdoors as the weather warms. We did a standing one in the trees on our test hike on the Lone Star Trail in Texas. The time for him was so worth it: Fatboy practically skipped over to me at the tent. And he was smiling. so great to see. It was a wonderful way to the end the day populated with sweet smells of blooming trees, mental tattoo designs (we'll HAVE to memorialize this later!!), a boost from Propel's electrolytes (sans sugar!), the sound of a grouse thrumming, and ideal weather. Nathan also lit up talking to Iron Man about his black-smithing work. We bested yesterday's miles with a new high today of 14.8. I have a feeling we'll pay for it, but life is indeed good!","Tri-Corner Knot shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561027,"From Fatboy:The last shelter at Davenport Gap had metal fencing enclosure. Is the fence there to protect the hikers or to protect the bears? We all likely smell about the same. Our night was spent tenting on a slope so we practiced our slip -n- slide technique one more time. I will never take for granted the privilege of sleeping on a level surface again! The weather was considerably warmer so getting dressed in the morning wasn't as numbing as it has been recently. I'm really going to enjoy having warmer weather for many reasons. We left the Great Smoky Mountains National Park this morning. Our destination was a measly 4 miles away. That's what I thought. My mind wasn't right and that was one of the hardest ""short"" hikes for me yet. We did go through some of the most beautiful wooded areas we've seen yet. There was a big creek with a lot of great camping sites beside it and a larger variety of wildflowers than we've seen anywhere. Ginger is such a joy to be with and her excitement with each new flower she discovered was a joy of its own. We left the forest and walked along an interstate access road and through an underpass to discover the trail going up a steep set of stone stairs. We read that the trail crossed a creek and intersected the road again before we walked about 100 yards up the unmarked gravel road to the Standing Bear Farm Hostel. The second I hit the road I started counting paces. See, I already said my mind wasn't right. When I had counted 100 foot strikes with my right foot and still didn't see any buildings I started to engage in the mental challenge of acting like an adult. Sometimes I'm even successful with that. The hostel did come into view and the first building we saw was a treehouse overhanging a small stream. Ginger was smiling from ear to ear and said she wished we could sleep there. Her joy and good nature are impossible for me to resist so my mental state improved immediately. We approached the entrance to the hostel and asked the man sitting near the office area if there were any private rooms available. He said we could stay in the treehouse and I was almost speechless. Ginger scores again! I sat down near a fire area and Ginger brought me a huge candy bar and a Mountain Dew. Saying I was happy would be a big understatement. She's my best friend and wife for many reasons, not the least of which is her constant kindness and generosity. We moved our packs to the treehouse and checked for our mail. I was happy to find they had received my Amazon order of KT Tape and benzoin spray. Maybe I'll be able to protect my skin enough to continue taping my foot so it doesn't destroy itself over the next 11 states! Where there's a will there's a stubborn farm boy who isn't ready to quit just yet. We were relaxing near the common area at the entrance when I looked up and saw Janet. Janet and Alan were the trail angels who gave us a ride from Clingman's Dome to Gatlinburg. They had stopped at a trail crossing and asked a group of hikers if anyone knew where Fatboy and Ginger were. Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet were among that group and told them where we were and Alan and Janet drove to the hostel to pick us up and take care of us! I never have experienced anything like this before and maybe never will again but I'm sure enjoying it now. Janet and Alan collected us with our dirty laundry(which we washed at Alan's cabin and showered) and took us to dinner at a buffet. I entered a food coma at this point but I do remember them taking us back to the hostel where we found our friends, Tequila Sunshine, Happy Feet, and Foghat. We enjoyed catching up on recent events with our friends and retired to our treehouse a short while later. The futon in the treehouse covered the hatch leading to the ground when converted to a bed so we were in for the night. It was fun being together in a private structure again. We've missed our shared time.","Davenport Gap shelter

We made stops at an outlet mall to buy new underwear for Fatboy. According to the scale at Standing Bear, Fatboy has lost over 16 pounds since starting this journey and his clothes aren't fitting quite the way they should to prevent chafing. It was Easter Sunday so some stores were closed but an Under Armor outlet store was open and Fatboy got better fitting underwear. Alan showed us some interesting features of the area and we bought groceries so Janet could make dinner for us all. Fatboy and Ginger rested in the afternoon and it was very comfortable to lie in bed and read and nap. Janet made burgers, asparagus, sauteed onions, potato salad and cole slaw and everything was delicious. We even had cheese cake and ice cream for dessert. (Ginger opted instead for the fresh strawberries. Yum!) It was a very nice meal with wonderful hosts and we enjoyed sharing our stories from hiking and our lives before the AT.

Packing wasn't as hard as some times in the past and we were ready to get back to the trail. Alan and Janet drove us back to the place we had left the trail and they hiked with us to the peak of Snowbird Mountain. This was a very difficult 4.5 mile climb, but Janet was the first to the peak in spite of two total knee replacements. She is tough! Fatboy was hurting from the climb and the recovery from time away from the trail. It's hard to get back to feeling comfortable with a full pack again but we all made it to the top for a happy trails goodbye. Trail magic doesn't begin to cover the gifts given us from Alan and Janet. They are some of the warmest, most open people we've ever known. We look forward to seeing them again when the opportunity presents.We hiked just short of 10 miles today with intermittent rain showers and some of the hardest elevation changes yet.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561034,"From Fatboy:Ginger's birthday. The weather has been intermittently crappy with occasional periods of deciding to rain just enough to require rain gear and then sweat so much that you're living in a stinky sauna suit. And mud. Not the suck your shoes off mud we experienced in the Smoky Mountains National Park, just enough mud to make touching anything to the ground become filthy. And impossible to find anywhere dry to sit. Ginger seems to love it. She has a perverse streak that can't be explained but she loves me and I'm a very grateful man. We have a little more than 23 miles to go before Hot Springs, NC so we need to make as many miles as we can today. We passed over Mack's Patch. This is a big bald spot on top of a mountain with a panoramic view if it's not raining and you're in the right frame of mind to want to look around. It was and I wasn't, it was cold, wet, and windy and I was in a mood that matched and all I wanted was to get somewhere warm and dry so I could get off my feet and rest my knees. We hiked on. Ginger had the good sense to not talk to me very much. I was having a tantrum time and it would have been impossible to talk me out of it. She's very smart about that and just leaves me alone to stew in my own crap until I'm through. We passed two shelters but hadn't covered enough miles to make Hot Springs after an ""easy day"" tomorrow. This ""easy day"" concept is very interesting to me. Somewhere in the last 200 plus miles of hiking up and down thousands of feet of elevation changes over rocks and sliding through muddy tracks we've decided that anything less than 10 miles is ""easy."" I think my IQ has dropped inversely to the number of miles I've hiked. We eventually found a very beautiful flat and level (usually impossibly elusive) tent site right beside the trail after 14.8 miles. We were both exhausted but managed dinner and the required evening tasks. It was great to lie down and feel safe and warm.From Ginger:
I'm 44 today! And happy birthday to my youngest brother, Matt, who turns the big 4-0 AND my cousin Ranya, who is four years behind Matt! I've always loved that the three of us share the day. Growing up, it was a special year when we were all together to celebrate. Sometimes they joined us from Beirut, other times from France, eventually, we got to visit together in Texas, but never at birthday time. Now, we are all stateside.
Rarely do we have any kind of cell or text or data access out here, but when I checked my phone at the end of the day, there were all kinds of birthday wishes awaiting me. What a wonderful way to end the day. My godmother, Mary Ellen, and her husband, Ashby, Mom and Dad, and my Ohio parents, the boys, Ken from home ... Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet made a song video from the trail, too: ""Feliz cumpleaños a ti ..."" All of you made me grin and tear up.
As Fatboy mentioned, we crossed Mack's Patch today. It's since been renamed Max Patch, and I dubbed it Matt's Patch in honor of Matt's birthday today. Our stay was short-lived up there because rain started rolling in and with it, wind, but I loved it. Reminded me of a place I'd visit with a high school friend in Germany.
Fatboy made we a wonderful birthday dinner once we settled into camp: a big ol' cup of decaf coffee, followed by a big ol' cup of chicken bouillon (did I mention I've been eating meat again out here?!), followed by a tuna packet and two fruits. I have everything I need, and I want everything I have. What a blessed birthday.","Brown Gap, USFS Road 148A

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561048,"From Fatboy:I was awake intermittently several times during the night but really became wide awake at 0330. I was ready to hit a town and get clean, get real food, and sleep in a real bed. It was raining and still dark so I tried to think happy thoughts and wish for a sunny, dry day. I went back to sleep only to be awakened by my alarm at 0630 and the sound of hard rain on our tent. This wasn't really what I had planned but I was determined to make the best of it. The rain lessened enough by 0730 that my fantasies of civilization overcame my good sense and I got dressed to begin my day. Getting dressed in a 2-man tent when you're over 6'1"" tall and can't move a single body part without pain should be an Olympic event. Dodging my flying elbows in this enclosed space is Ginger's first challenge every day. My determination was tested as it started raining while I was stumbling away from the tent with my trusty cat hole shovel and smashed roll of toilet paper. Doing ""your business"" in the woods is barbaric in the best of circumstances; when it's raining too, it's torture. I accomplished the required event and returned to the tent to begin making breakfast. The rain had decreased to light showers so I began heating water for coffee and oatmeal. It started raining hard again so I tried to move this process to the atrium of our tent. I spilled half of the water and scared Ginger when I tried to trim my beard with a lit rocket stove. I eventually had coffee and oatmeal prepared and managed to eat while sitting with my muddy feet protruding from the open tent door. Sounds delightfully comfortable and cozy, right? Yeah, it was just as much fun as it sounds. We broke camp and managed to pack up all of our wet stuff and were out of camp by 0915. No matter when we get up, tenting or from a shelter we don't leave camp until 0915. That's just us. We began our long descent into Hot Springs. We had more than 8 miles of easy day ahead of us.The most memorable part of this last day is how hard and long this ""easy day"" was. It was all down hill. Not the steep down hill where you're always worried about falling on your face but rather, the long subtle declines with lots of switchback that grind your knees up slowly. Another memorable feature of this section is how it teases you. Hot Springs is a tiny town where everybody knows everybody. It's quite pretty and has a couple of really great places to eat, a good outfitter, a dollar store, and a complete cross-section of places to stay. Mayberry 2017. We had reservations for a suite we were sharing with Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet at the fanciest place in town. The teaser is: you can see and hear the town for a long time before you get there and it feels like you have to walk past the town to walk back to it. This is really frustrating when your ""easy day"" is taking 6 hours to complete and you're hungry and sore. We finally crossed the street to enter town and found the AT marked with stones set into the sidewalk instead of white blazes. It was nice to see a town so interested in hikers. We stopped at the first restaurant in town as was recommended by Cash Back, a hiker we talked to a couple of miles ago. He said this diner had the best meatloaf he's ever had. I remember recommendations like that so we just had to eat there. We were there in the middle of the afternoon so the place was almost empty but the server brought us coffee and water quickly and we placed our order. There was a local lady who was leaving as we entered who stopped to talk to Ginger and give us the low-down on the town and get our story too. Ginger attracts good things like an open Coke can attracts bees in spring. It's amazing to watch and even better to be included in because we're together. Our food was delicious and we decided to return to this restaurant another time during our stay. We walked on toward our lodging and met a couple of other friends along the street. I didn't want to socialize much, I was ready for a shower and a bed. We arrived at our rooms and met Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet who had already checked in. Our room was beautiful and included a sitting room with comfortable chairs as well as coffee and tea provided. I was in heaven. We spent the rest of the day cleaning our bodies and feeding our spirits with good friends. We met Foghat for dinner and were back in our bed early. It was a great day.From Ginger:My math was off; I misled Fatboy. I'd said it was just over 8 miles today. Turns out, it was closer to 10. I swear, I need to use the calculator on my phone for even the easiest equation. THAT would actually make carrying the phone more useful many days!I felt strong today, but I have to admit that yesterday, I'd hit a wall between 5 and 6:30. There was a final uphill that I hadn't spotted in our guide. I'm glad it was out of the way when we started today, but yesterday's miles took their toll.We were both looking forward to strolling into a town where the trail is part of Main Street. It turned out to be harder on our feet -- seriously, OUCH -- but it felt ceremonious to walk over AT symbols poured into the concrete here. I'm looking forward to doing this again.

We stayed in an 1800s mansion that had been restored and was now the finest lodging in town. It's VERY nice. Ginger left me resting in bed and walked to do our laundry and explore the town. I spent a long time in the Jacuzzi bath and soaked some pain away and napped. This is a wonderful way to spend your day. We hung all of our wet gear to dry and enjoyed our time with our friends. I eventually wanted to explore the town too so Ginger and I went out to see what was about. This town is really small. As in one cop small. There's quite a bit of hiker related activity and a small local art venue in a coffee shop. I thought Ginger was going to apply for a job because she was smiling so much. It's a really nice little town. We went to the outfitter and I bought smaller shorts. It's the first time I've worn a size 36 waist in 30 years and they weren't tight! It felt good to not always be pulling my pants up. We returned to our rooms and sorted out our gear and food supply. It's always a challenge to decide when you're leaving town, where your next resupply will be, and how much food to carry. We're getting better at this and even found ways to reduce each of our pack weights by several pounds. Every gram that you don't carry counts. We went to the diner for dinner and had a great evening with our good friends, returned to our rooms and went to bed with clean bodies and full spirits. Life is good.
From Ginger:
This is the kind of place I want to come back to when we have more time, and are able to carry things out with us. It's a neat place for gifts and crafts. I imagine ArtiSun Gallery as the kind of venue where Nathan's wood-working would sell. Any time I can talk up what he's done, I do. While our laundry churned at the Wash Tub, I checked out the gallery. Super neat place. Met an interesting couple, Michael and Beth from Sarasota, Fla. They're enjoying a long weekend here, and hope to hike the trail together. We had a good chat, and they gifted me with the mango smoothie I'd bought for lunch. If I recall correctly, Michael remembered Hot Springs as a cool destination worthy of a future visit when he hiked previously. The kind woman behind the counter was a past thru-hiker as well, and she hooked Nathan up later with a ginger drink that I know will make him smile over camp dinners. Oh, the trail and its fascinating people, on and off it.","Mountain Magnolia Inn, Hot Springs, NC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562098,"From Fatboy:We slept until 0830! What a gift to feel rested and not have severe leg and foot pain. We had breakfast at our lodging and then went to the post office. We decided to mail our bear canister home and we filled it with about 5 pounds of other stuff we no longer wanted to carry. It felt good to lose that weight. We returned to check out of our rooms and packed all of our stuff. With food and water we are both carrying between 38 to 40 pounds AFTER we lightened our loads. We are still overloaded but we're getting better. It would be great to get to 30 pounds or less for each of us but we just haven't figured that out yet. We know we could save a few pounds if we bought ultra lite packs but those are around $250 each and we're not quite ready to make that choice. We said our goodbyes to Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet around noon and they hiked off North. I'm sure we'll see them again soon. Ginger went to the library to update this journal and Fatboy went to the various places around town where they stamped our AT Passport. Then Fatboy visited a styling salon and got a much needed haircut and beard trim. It felt really good to be somewhat groomed again. We met after the haircut and went to lunch. It's really hard to resist town food after you've eaten mostly one pot meals for a while. After lunch Ginger completed the journal updates and we decided to hike out of town. It started to rain about this time so we delayed until the rain stopped. The weather was very changeable and we decided to just go. That turned out to be a great choice for us. We did get rained on some but the trail was almost deserted and the rain felt good and kept us cool as we climbed out of town over Lovers Leap Rock. The view from the top was very nice as we looked over the town and the French Broad River.We only hiked a few miles but they were important ones. Our conversation about why we were hiking and how we were managing our schedule and mileage was really good for us both. Fatboy just isn't able to hike the 12 and 14 mile days back to back and still be able to enjoy this adventure. It's just too painful. Fatboy compared how this hike is going to his prior experiences of long distance motorcycle rides. He's ridden his Harley over 1000 miles in one day twice and 972 miles one day on a different occasion. This might be worth something in bragging rights but actually it means nothing but pain and exhaustion during the event. The rides that he recalled that were a lot more fun didn't include any mileage notation but did include sights and memorable locations or events. This is how we decided we were going to approach the AT from now on. Everyone has heard the mantra: Hike your own hike. It's sometimes hard to remember that and why you're actually doing this when you're looking at the maps and trying to figure out resupply locations or mail drop dates. We found a lovely quiet site to tent near a water source and actually had a pleasant evening without much stress. Yes, Fatboy's feet and legs are still sore but it's manageable. Yes, Fatboy lost another rock bag (sock) up in a tree as he was hanging the food out of reach of animals. Yes, it did begin to rain as Fatboy was filtering water and trying to prepare dinner. We also saw a box turtle sitting in the middle of the trail and he pulled everything back in his shell as we passed and we heard a wipporwill as the sun went down. How could you top that? Yes, we had the privilege of spending our day together doing something few people ever attempt and we chose to spend that time being loving and kind to ourselves and to each other. It was a great day!From Ginger:What a relief. If we're going to do this in a more enjoyable way, ""this is not an endurance test."" We'll choose memorable moments over memorable mileage.","Hot Springs, NC

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562100,"From Fatboy:It rained quite a lot during the night but the day started with only clouds and wind. Ginger did the cooking duty for breakfast and served Fatboy coffee and oatmeal IN BED! Talk about being pampered. We broke camp and started hiking around 0915. That's our time and we're sticking to it. There were very few people on the trail and the reduced stress and fun focus of our hike made the journey a pleasure. We did pass a ""boxed spring"" that we were both curious about what that meant. It looked to me like a dam had been built below a spring and a pond formed. It was interesting but the water had a strong sulfur smell. We drank it but it wouldn't be our first choice for a water source. We walked through intermittent strong rain showers but the trail wasn't too muddy in many places. We stopped at Spring Mountain Shelter and used the bear cables to dry our rain fly and tent. I've never seen anyone else hang things from the cables to dry. It worked great but I was very careful to not tangle anything for fear of tearing our tent to shreds. I think this will only be an option on low wind days. We set up our tent on a small rise just past the shelter. We had a dilemma for the first time with this site: we couldn't decide which end was uphill! It was nice to have a level site for a change. We had dinner and talked to the trail maintainer. He's one of those unsung volunteers who work very hard to keep the trail passable and do the maintenance on the shelters and the privies. He even told us he would pack out our trash! These volunteers are the real trail magic for us all. It started to rain soon after dinner so we hung our food on the cables and retired to our warm, dry tent. It was another beautiful day.From Ginger:Thanks to Sweaty Cheddar, the volunteer trail maintainer, for his work on the privy, especially. Both Fatboy and I tried to improve the situation, but after talking with Cheddar, we didn't have the necessary equipment. I didn't get anywhere with the available shovel. Turns out I needed a ""fecal fork."" We're learning way more about wilderness waste-processing (read: moldering privies) than we expected! Who drives an hour and a half every month or two to mix poop and duff and leaves? People who care about the woods and our impact on it. I hope I can be that generous as a trail alum.","Near Pump Gap trail crossing

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562103,"From Fatboy:It began storming last night before sunset. We had lightning strikes all around us with impressive thunder that made us jump inside our tent. It rained ALL night and we were still mostly dry! Our beautiful, flat tent site became a shallow pond and water and mud splashed up inside the vestibules on each side of the tent. My side of the tent was a puddle and my sleeping bag was wet. I was chilly but not to the point of shivering. Let's call it: wet-hiker-brisk morning cold. I ventured to the privy and managed to not fall on the slippery path, but only because I used my trekking poles for the walk. I even managed to get our food bag moved into the vestibule so we could have something to eat even if it never stopped raining. Getting back into the tent after one of these excursions requires a level of athletic flexibility that I don't have but I did my best to keep what was wet as contained as possible. We decided to wait out the rain and I went back to sleep. Why fight nature? We must have both been very tired because we didn't seem to have any trouble napping the morning away. When we both had slept until we couldn't sleep any more Ginger served me coffee in bed. Two mornings in a row of coffee in bed. I'm a very lucky man.We kept waiting for the rain to stop but it never did. It lessened enough eventually that we made the decision to move on in the early afternoon. We decided to go to a hostel that was only a mile away from a trail crossing so we would only have about 6 miles to hike and still be able to be under roof tonight. The terrain of the hike was reasonable and the rain was relatively light so we didn't have the need for a lot of rest stops or clothing layer changes. We arrived at the hostel around 1730 and it was a big relief to know we wouldn't have to tent in the rain again. The hostel didn't have any vacancies but they did arrange for us to stay on the balcony that was under roof next to the hostel office overlooking a creek. I hung our wet tent footprint and rain fly up to dry and Ginger went in search of food. Bananas and apples, cookies (for Fatboy), coffee, pizza, and corn dogs later we were starting to feel a little better. While we were eating we saw Happy Feet enter the hostel store. It's amazing how we seem to keep catching up with our friends and spending nights at the same places. Now it was time for a shower for Fatboy. While I was taming the hiker funk, Ginger made friends with a lady who was staying in one of the cabins. When I stepped out of the men's shower room Ginger told me we had bunks in a cabin with her new friend and her husband. Score again with Ginger magic! We packed everything up and moved to a warm, dry, cabin courtesy of our new friends. Life is good.
From Ginger:
I was all over the place today. This is where it's not only valuable to have a hiking (and life!) partner to motivate you, but also to help rein in my disaster scenarios, focusing on only the next right thing to do. This morning, after we had coffee and sat in a rising tide (OK, puddle) of water in and around the tent, I was a little paralyzed. Fear would have kept me right there in place, not wanting things to get worse. In retrospect, they would have gotten way worse if we didn't start moving.
I'm so glad Nathan remembered that we'd be crossing a road near a hostel listed in AWOL's guide. All we'd have to do is detour a mile off the trail once we got to that road. Five miles on the trail and another one to a dry place. Brilliant. The hostel owner could only offer us tenting under their pavilion or on the office's back porch. They were crazy booked after last night's deluge. With the remaining space available, we'd be exposed, but at least have head cover. Sold. God bless Mary's curiosity about my wet shoes in the shower area! I'd gone there to put on all of my dry clothes -- literally -- before we climbed into our wet sleeping bag with the dry liners and emergency foil blanket, and she struck up a conversation while I was adding layers. I don't know anything about Ginger magic. I do know that when I accept the circumstances I'm in -- no matter what they are or how daunting they may be -- there is always a blessing in the acceptance. Sometimes the blessing is a lesson; today it was a literally a rescue. Innumerable thanks to Mary and her husband, Pete, also known as Chicken and Rooster.
From Fatboy:
More Trail Wisdom ...
- Hike your own hike. Don't allow yourself to get drawn into conversations about mileage or when you started or expect to finish the trail. It's an insidious thought poison that will make you compare what you're doing with whatever someone else SAYS they do. Persistent questions can be answered with nebulous answers. People don't generally care what you say because they're only waiting to tell you what they are doing. Be polite but remember it's ok to not say anything too.
- Pace is important. For a lot of our early hike we were hiking too fast. The difference in the way your feet and legs feel at the end of the day if you aren't pushing yourself is amazing. The extra distance isn't worth the pain.
- Stop to photograph or view anything you're interested in. This may be the only time you'll ever be here or see this. The beauty of the trail is why we're doing this.","Spring Mountain shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562106,"From Fatboy:Some hostels are better than others. It's a complicated business and the hiker community can be difficult to manage. There's a huge diverse population ranging from really young people to some who are pretty well along in age. There's a lot of dope-smoking in some groups and for a few the AT is just one long rolling party. There's a lot of competitive banter between some hikers who feel the need to announce their high mileage pace and also some one upmanship with bad weather endured. Anyone who believes they know what all hikers are like must have been around a different group than I've met. I believe anyone who runs a successful hostel business must have a love of the trail and some sense of the magic that happens every day for a lot of hikers. This isn't a way to make a lot of money easily.We spent the day doing a lot of routine things like drying out all of our gear and washing clothes. Ginger wasn't feeling well so after she shuttled into town to access some funds, she rested. Fatboy washed clothes the old fashioned way. The hostel had some problems with their well, so there wasn't water to use the washing machine. I did find two wash tubs and asked the owner for a bucket. The owner gave me some laundry soap and I dipped water out of the creek, washed our clothes by hand, rinsed them in creek water, and hung them to dry on a paracord clothesline I rigged in front of our cabin. We read books and planned our next day with the idea of a short slackpack as an easy option to rest our bodies.From Ginger:So enjoyed our morning conversation with Chicken and Rooster. I admire their commitment: They are completing the AT in sections and are eight years in. It was interesting to learn about their approach. We'll likely incorporate some of their wisdom and/or recommendations in their completed segments.I'm getting sick again. Not sure if I'm lacking the nutrients I usually get at home, or if it's exposure in the common areas to others who might be sick, or a combination of those and other things. Day started well, ended rough. Hoping sleep helps.","Hemlock Hollow Inn + Hostel

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562107,"From Fatboy:We slept late and enjoyed breakfast in our cabin. Our clothes were still wet because the weather hasn't dried out and it feels wet and muggy most of the time. The owner of the hostel dried our clothes in her dryer and they smelled very fresh. Maybe the secret is creek water rinse? I got a call from my sister who informed me that our father was in the hospital with some cardiac problems. After speaking to her and my father I decided we would still hike today. I couldn't do anything to help the situation with my dad and he said he didn't need me to return to Ohio to be with him. He's surrounded with family who cares for him and I will be able to keep informed of his progress via phone and my sister. We ate lunch and arranged for a ride to the trail to slackpack for our easy day. Five miles should be easy compared to what we've done before. Right? We configured fanny packs for a few necessities and congratulated ourselves on our planning. We estimated our trip at about 3 1/2 hours and set out at a leisurely pace. Every time you leave a hostel or a town you immediately climb up a hill. Some are bigger climbs than others, but you ALWAYS climb! We met some familiar faces on the trail and were generally having our easy day. We were slower than we estimated so we tried to call the hostel to let them know we would be late for our pickup. The difficulty with that plan is that our cell phone provider is SPRINT. Do not begin the AT with SPRINT if you want to actually use your phone to call or text message anyone. It won't work much of anywhere. Our cell phones are really just poor quality cameras that were very expensive and cost a lot of money per month to not be of any use as communication devices about 99% of the time. (Verizon and AT&T seem to be better.) Our final destination for the day was a place called Jones Meadow. It's listed in the bible (Awol's book) so it couldn't be a problem. I was horribly wrong. Our first scheduled pickup time was not going to be reachable. We found ourselves about 2 1/2 miles from our end destination with only an hour to go. I would have been able to walk that distance on a treadmill at home but now I struggle to make more than 1 1/2 miles per hour. I've discovered that I don't walk faster while slackpacking, I only walk easier and without as much pain. We tried to call to let our ride know we were going to be late but couldn't get a cell signal. Again, I love SPRINT¿ When we finally did get a call through our driver had already left to get us. I started to become concerned that our ""easy"" slackpacking day was going to become an adventure. Adventure. Definition: what happens as the result of poor planning. We finally arrived at the landmarks identified by Awol only to notice that there was no meadow or road near the trail. We asked some other hikers who passed if they knew where Jones Meadow was. Even hikers with the guthook GPS app had difficulty deciding how to reach our destination. Around this time I began to feel an awareness of how vulnerable we were and how uncomfortable the coming night might become. We didn't have our tent, sleeping bag, food, stove or a lot of extra warm clothing. We were screwed if we had to spend the night outdoors with only our water filter and a space blanket with some paracord. We eventually found Jones Meadow by exploring a rocky mile of trail three times and hiking several unmarked blue blazed trails. By now the sun was beginning to set and we were three hours after our original pickup time. The good news is: Jones Meadow is right next to some communication towers so we should have cell service. Wrong! SPRINT proved about as useful as two tin cans and a string. We sat in a parking lot and listened to the frogs sing until we started to get cold. There was only one road down the mountain from this site so we began to walk. We were gifted with one of the most beautiful panoramas from the top of the mountain and we were making progress toward being indoors tonight so my spirits improved. We were met a long way down the mountain by our ride and returned to our hostel unharmed but wiser.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565873,"From Fatboy:
Ginger is fully sick.  Her head is full of congestion, she's feverish, her ears are plugged up and she feels really bad.  I don't feel so good myself.  We made the joint decision to go to Greeneville, N.C, for some better food, easier access to transportation, and all of the comforts of a modern hotel.  The situation with my father is still tenuous so we made arrangements to be able to rent a car and travel to Ohio if his condition deteriorated. The hostel owner agreed to shuttle us so we were off trail for a truly decadent zero to recuperate and evaluate our adventure.  Our difficulty with slack-packing yesterday was an unfortunate experience for us and didn't make being sick any more pleasant.
We spent the rest of the day exploring the area near our hotel, eating, recharging electronics, and cleaning our bodies and spirits.  I really appreciated resting my feet and knees because I pushed too hard last evening while trying to find Jones Meadow.  I was very sore and had a lot of difficulty walking even very short distances without a pack.  I thoroughly enjoyed a long hot shower as I always do.","Hemlock Hollow Inn + Hostel

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565874,"From Fatboy:We had breakfast in our hotel.  Biscuits and gravy may not be the healthiest options but they certainly are a treat to me after eating hiker meals for a while.  We decided to walk to Wal-Mart about 2 miles away to see about some better-fitting clothes for Fatboy.  Greenville isn't engineered for pedestrians near our hotel.  We try to stay off of highways and limited access roads but sometimes we have no choice except to walk near them in the grassy right of ways.  Profanity was shouted at us by young men from passing cars twice today.  That's always disturbing to us.  We weren't dirty or carrying packs or dressed in a manner that would make us appear homeless.  No matter what we looked like, is that a reason to treat another human being in such a horrible way?  We were simply walking.  Some towns are a lot friendlier than others; this one doesn't seem to be close enough to the AT to be tolerant of us.  That's a shame.
We completed our shopping for new shirts, lunch, and some basic hiker resupply food items, and returned to our hotel.  Ginger used the business center to update our journal and Fatboy soaked in a hot tub and took a shower.  Resting and restoring our health delays our progress on the trail but we're making the best of it.
The best part of the day was finding out that my father went home from the hospital.  I was able to talk to him on my cell phone (SPRINT does work sometimes) and he's happy to be home.  I'm grateful for the people who work at the Affinity hospital in Massillon, Ohio, for taking such good care of my dad.  He's irreplaceable and knowing he's home safely is my trail magic for today.","Greeneville, North Carolina

Our ride collected us in front of the hotel at 0900.  We were back to the trail a little after 1000 and blue blazed from Jones Meadow to the AT.  It felt good to be making progress North again.  There's a short section of ridge just north of Jones Meadow with an alternate trail designated for use in bad weather.  It was a beautiful but windy day so we decided to find out what it means when the sign says ""bouldering.""  It was a beautiful hike along a ridge with some steep passages over very large rocks with some very high winds.  The scenery was stunning and worth the effort but the winds were a force to contend with.  Ginger, especially, was affected by the winds and had to scurry quickly through some areas.  Fatboy is Fatboy; having more mass made the passages easier because the wind didn't push me around as much.  We finished our day at a shelter but decided to tent.  We crossed the milestone of 300 miles today.  That seems like a damn long way to walk to me.  Dinner was some delicious dried goo with noodles.  It keeps us going but it sure isn't gourmet.  We were zipped in by a little after 2000 having made 11.4 miles on our ""easy day"" back on trail.","Jones Meadow

Mayday!  Another good commie holiday.  I was awake at 0630 but Ginger was snoring away and I didn't have the heart to wake her.  When I woke up again it was beginning to rain and the wind was howling.  We hurriedly moved our stuff into the shelter and took our tent down as quickly as possible.  Then it really started to rain.  We were able to dry the tent and rainfly by hanging them under the eaves in the front of the shelter and waited for the rain to stop.  The sky still looked like rain but we left the shelter at 1040.  This was the beginning of one of those days where you put rain gear on; take rain gear off; on; off, etc.  All day long.  The terrain wasn't too rough but it was tiring to alternate between being wet and cold and being sweaty and hot.  The hardest part of these days is the mental effect.  Distances always seem longer and the hiking is slower because of the hazards of slips and falls.  It wears you down.  We finally made Hogback Ridge Shelter and it finished as a beautiful and sunny day.  We hung our wet gear to dry in the sun and completed the standard chores.  Ginger went to get water while I made coffee.  We had decided to stay in the shelter so we didn't have to set up our tent.  This is a mixed blessing because of dealing with mice and sharing the shelter with other hikers.  We had another dinner of amazing goo and we're ready for bed by 2030.
From Ginger:
Rain, rain, rain today on May Day! Nathan educated me about mayapple plants and they are mentioned in AWOL's guide, so I was looking for them from the start. They look like small umbrellas. Or palm trees. Anyway, now they've blossomed! Mayapple blossoms on May Day. We also saw COUNTLESS tiny salamanders, whose limbs were so minuscule they looked like itty-bitty snakes wriggling through the streams of water on our path. Also saw two brilliant orange -- Harley orange -- salamanders, apple trees and meadows of blackberry bushes. The rain takes its toll mentally, and I made the mistake of asking where we were prematurely. Better not to know that you're still four miles out from where you hoped was just two. Our final stretch into Hogback climbed 514 feet in 1.2 miles. Writing it doesn't look as tough as it felt. I thought for sure it would have been more extreme. I was so glad to reach the shelter. Had really interesting conversations with two section-hiker Coasties and thru-hikers Bambi and Spike. Spike has spent considerable time in the Middle East, and expressed the same admiration of the mountains and potential hiking terrain I've heard previously about Afghanistan. We all agreed that the no-door privy will be especially enjoyable with the sunrise view.  It's just two couples in the shelter tonight and quiet!","Flint Mountain shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566009,"From Fatboy:
The day dawned beautiful but cold.  We both slept well but cold.  Our sleeping bag is rated for 15 degrees plus we use bag liners and we sleep in a double bag but it was still cold.  Getting out of bed in long johns to use the privy when it's this cold isn't a lot of fun but this privy was the luxury spot of the trail.  The privy faced east and there wasn't a door so I got to admire the sunrise as an added bonus.  Ginger brought me coffee so my day began better than anyone else's I've ever met.  My skin started to blister yesterday from the KT Tape so today I'll be hiking without any support for my plantar fasciitis in my right foot.  Our first road crossing was in about 3 miles so I'll know by then if I can continue or if I need to rest and heal.  The trail was beautiful and we enjoyed the scenery and we admired the flowers and small bugs that were active all day.  My foot didn't turn out to be as big an issue as I feared.  It hurts, but then it hurts even when I'm not hiking.  I refuse to let this stop me from enjoying my life and my time with my wife on this adventure. 
The trail crossed a big bald and we paused to admire the views and take a few photos.  It's funny how you can be hiking and see something on another mountain and then find yourself in the middle of what you were admiring a couple of hours later.  We ended our day after ~10 miles just past Big Bald  to spend another night in a shelter.  We had amazing goo again for dinner.  I'm really getting tired of Knorr side dishes mixed with instant mashed potatoes or ramen noodles.  It fills you up and it is filled with calories but the textures and appearance are starting to get really boring.  We have some instant meals arriving from Amazon at our next resupply spot and I'm looking forward to increasing the variety in our meals.  I also ordered some smaller zip-off hiker pants, some support socks, and a new shirt for Ginger.  It'll be just like Christmas! Ginger arranged for our pick up tomorrow at 1500 at a gap that's less than 6 miles away.  Our next cabin is at Cantarrosa Farm and I'm excited.  This place has been highly recommended and they have an apiary too!  I'm really looking forward to biscuits or pancakes with local honey.
There was something of interest during our evening meal.  I set up our stove on the picnic table in front of the shelter and boiled a liter of water to make coffee and rehydrate our goo as usual.  I mixed the goo and wrapped the pot in my fleece jacket to allow more ""cooking"" time while leaving the wrapped pot on the table.  There was another hiker sitting on the opposite side of the table when I stood up.  The table flipped on its side, dumping the hiker on his back and launching our fleece wrapped food pot away from the table.  The hiker was ok and our food never spilled a drop!  No one got up from that table again without warning everyone. From Ginger:Remember how I said last night's final stretch of 1.2 miles felt like an eternity over 500+ feet? Today, over 3 miles and DOWN 735 feet felt like the easiest and fastest stretch yet. I would have sworn it was just 20 minutes that we were on the trail,  and we were already to Sams Gap! There we enjoyed a pit stop from trail angels who brought fresh fruit with other snacks, and we got to wish Spike and Bambi happy trails as they planned to hitch into Erwin ahead of us. For me, today was one of my favorite scenery days. The terrain was extremely varied and had the monstrous, boulderous climb to Big Bald, but I loved it. All the uphills. Big Bald was the only named one, but there should have been others. We had lots of what I call kiss-my-knees climbs. That's how steep it can be. Also walked through a beautiful 10-acre meadow and later laughed at a blue-blaze sign labeled ""Nature Trail"" -- as if we weren't already on one. Walking across Big Bald with Nathan made me so happy. It was WORK getting there, and again, a place we'd never experience just by driving. I loved sharing it with him.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566016,"From Fatboy:We were up earlier than usual after not sleeping much for me.  A down side to sleeping in shelters is: They are colder than tents and you're sleeping in a commune.  If someone coughs, snores, or has one of those atrocious sleep systems that sound like horrible thunder or stampeding elephants every time they move or roll over it wakes me up.  EVERY time until I'm so exhausted that I simply pass out.  Someone had one of those sleeping bags and pads.  I don't care how light, warm, highly rated by the hiking gods, or perfect in every other way those are.  I will never sleep on one and I don't understand how they do.
We had only about six miles to hike and the weather was perfect.  Cool, clear, and dry.  The trail was exceptionally well maintained through this section and we stopped often to admire plants, critters, and scenery.  We arrived at our pickup point 1 1/2 hours early and we're able to call for our ride.  Sometimes even SPRINT works!  One of the highlights of my day was sitting at the roadside watching the butterflies drink water from a tire track.  I showed Ginger how to get the butterflies to crawl on her hand and bask in the sun.  It was beautiful to see her joy in such a simple thing.  We had reservations at Cantarroso Farms for a private cabin and were very happy to discover how nice and quiet the accommodations are.  The owners are hiker friendly and knowledgeable and have dogs, an apiary, and free range chickens.  It was a lot of fun to watch Ginger get her dog time and interact with the chickens.  We went to a great little Italian restaurant and both tried to appease our hiker hunger.  The Wal-Mart was right next door so we did some shopping too.  It was one of the best days on the trail so far.From Ginger:INDEED!","Bald Mountain shelter

We ate real food for breakfast and were excited to start our slackpacking day.  Our plan was to go about 11 miles and the trail profile didn't include any major elevation changes.  I even packed a turkey sandwich for my lunch!  Our host at Cantarosa Farm drove past the trailhead where we would be ending our hike and outlined contingency plans for bad weather (this is the kind of detail that is so important to making slackpacking safe and enjoyable.)  The forecast called for a good chance of rain late in the day so we wanted to get some miles behind us before getting soaked and cold.  The ride up the mountain included views of some pretty waterfalls along the road. We started where we'd been picked up two days ago and we're happy to be going north again.  The walking was easier than any day before and the first 5 miles went very quickly so we stopped for lunch at the No Business Knob Shelter.  My feet were starting to hurt some but they weren't horrible and I just resigned myself to another day of struggling with the hike.  No big deal.  The weather became quite cold and the sky turned dark but we didn't have any significant rain to slow us down.  There was a large tree that had fallen across the trail that presented a very difficult situation.  It was a mess of tangled dead and live tree branches and a main trunk that was over 12"" in diameter.  Ginger could climb above the trail to pass the obstruction but it was way too steep for me and I knew I'd never make it.  She did pass the tree and we worked for about ten minutes breaking branches and clearing brush from the tangle until I could squirm under, over, and through the tree trunks to get past the deadfall.  It was fun and frustrating at the same time.  We hiked on.  As the miles passed my feet began to feel hot and more uncomfortable with each step.  I didn't really know what was happening but I did know the only way I was getting off the mountain was to walk.  Erwin began to appear in the distance from various vantage points and the weather continued to threaten rain so we hurried on.  When we at last reached the trailhead my feet felt like they were burning and I couldn't wait to get back to our cabin. We stopped at Uncle Johnnie's Hostel and got a couple of snacks and called for our ride.  Fortunately the cabin was only about a mile away so our wait was brief and we were back to our cabin quickly.  When I took my socks off I discovered that my feet were very red and they itched like mad.  I immediately took a shower and applied cortisone cream to try to stop the inflammation.  I though I was having a reaction to some new compression socks that I had worn for the first time.  After thinking about it for a while I realised that I'd rubbed camphorated menthol analgesic balm on my feet earlier in the morning and I was having a reaction to the chemicals in the ointment.  I will NEVER do that again.  That was one of the most miserable few miles I've ever walked.  I took some benadryl, we ate dinner, and I was asleep for the night before 2000.  

From Ginger:Happy 35 years to Mike M. at home! Cinco de Mayo is more memorable for me sober, and with a birthday to commemorate! After a homemade, trailmade 35-year marker, I joined Fatboy in the shelter for lunch with Speedy and Yahtze. Speedy went to school at Virginia Tech. Made me excited to get to the Blacksburg area of Virginia. It felt good to do a little trail maintenance for those who would come behind us today, and Nathan made a note of the mile so we could let the local trail group (or Peggy at Cantarosa) know about the fallen tree. Other highlights today: the view of the Nolichucky River from rocky tops, a small brown garter snake (I like these guys!), gentle terrain on the many downhills, a quick stop at Uncle Johnny's hostel, where we bought what will be our first sample of Mountain House dehydrated meals. They're super-light! Also, we did a YouTube channel interview featuring 2017 thru-hikers. We'll have to look that up later. The gentlemen compiling them isn't as far behind in his updates as we are.

Our day began with coffee in bed.  This is one of our rituals that means so much to us.  It just feels so wonderful to lie in bed and have coffee brought to you and spend a few minutes talking and showing our gratitude for the wonderful life we share.  We dressed and were shuttled to Huddle House for breakfast.  That's a real treat, too.  Ginger had never been to this restaurant and I knew she'd like it.  If it has biscuits, gravy, coffee and/or pancakes it's going to be a hit with her and Huddle House is one of the best at those things.  After our feed we walked through Erwin's downtown district because they were having an outdoor festival with lots of crafts vendors and even a petting zoo.  Ginger is one of the most sincere animal lovers I've ever known and baby animals bring out a very child-like joy in her that's a pleasure to experience.  There were bunnies, a goat, calves, and a sow with pigs for her to pet and talk to.  It was a great morning.  We walked to the library and called for our ride.  We made a quick stop at Food Lion and returned to our cabin.  We spent the rest of the day reading and laying about.  The weather was cold and rainy and we both commented several times how grateful we were to be in a warm, dry building.  Dinner included a Stouffer's casserole that said ""Family Size"" on the box.  We must be a complete family because we didn't have any trouble eating all of it!  We went to bed and both slept very well.
From Ginger:
I splurged and bought knitting needles during our Wal-Mart run. I missed that from home.
Never expected to be eating eggs or bacon with my morning starch, but here I am, petting baby chicks and eating unfertilized eggs. The hens at Cantarroso lay white, brown and blue-green ones! So cool to see the entire cycle ... as long as I don't think about it too much!Nell's Cabin is adorable. Mike and Peggy have it outfitted well, like a tiny house. It's best feature, in my opinion, is a composting toilet I'd love to have in our own home. You crank a handle to ""flush,"" which mixes either liquid or solid waste with the compost material below. It's truly odorless. And expensive (I already scoped them out online). Anyway, while we're here, I'm using it as often as possible. It's fun to turn it.","Cantarroso Farm, Erwin, TN

We covered the 9-plus miles all after 12 noon, which helps show just how gentle the terrain is coming out of Erwin!

Nathan tried to fry it for me, but you can't do anything but boil water in our stove set. (He is so good to me!)

I don't know how we made it, but we did. He led us right up to Roan High Knob shelter in what had to be record speed. I literally could not keep up ... but he made me smile.

We won't likely be back here; we're out here to see things you can only walk to; I won't grow if I don't do things that are uncomfortable; we weren't actually late yet ... and it turned out we weren't anyway. ""Breathe in faith, breathe out fear."" We made it!The shelter was pretty cool: a two-story one with a ladder and hatch for upstairs and windows that open out. Also, four whole walls and a door. Where was this place during our snowy days?!I marveled at how Mountain Harbour has evolved as a business, with Mary and her late husband at the helm.

I flopped around on the bed all night.  I always have trouble sleeping in a new place the first night but it doesn't bother me to sleep in our tent because that's ""home"" no matter where we set up camp.  It is strange though to go from sleeping in small bag liners with long johns on to being in a bed that's much larger than your entire tent.  It was glorious to be able to shower and sit in a Jacuzzi tub right in our own private room.  I will be convinced until the day I die that indoor plumbing is one of the greatest inventions of all time!  We even watched a movie.  We're not very big into television but we did enjoy Tom Hanks in ""Bridge of Spies.""  Ginger was particularly interested in the story because she spent her teen years in Germany and remembers some of the landmarks portrayed in the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed being clean and well fed.
Breakfast was everything we wished for and more.  We're both kind of foodies and the dishes we were served rivaled anything we have ever eaten for breakfast anywhere.  I mean ANYWHERE!  We had great conversations with our table companions and completely enjoyed spending about 90 minutes savoring our food and community.  We met Michael, who is planning a thru-hike with his son in 2019 and had a good time talking about hiking and life in general.  He had his car and kindly offered to take us to Dollar General so we could resupply.  Ginger and I have continued to be so blessed by the kindness of the people we meet on or near the trail.  The true trail magic I've found is a renewal of my feeling that people are inherently good and kind.  The saying I heard was: You get what you give.  I think I must not have been giving out very good things for a lot of years but I will do better with that in the future.
From Ginger:
Have to note more ingenuity from Mountain Harbour:
In the vending machine outside, for after-hours, Shannon put in Knorr pasta sides for hungry hikers and protein bars. First time I've seen that. Also, I made of list of what was offered at breakfast. Check out the spread: egg casserole with Perogis and chives, eggs with onions and hashbrowns, eggs with cheese and hashbrowns, sausage links and patties, biscuits, sausage gravy, fresh strawberries and pineapple, roasted potatoes, blueberry pancakes, juice, coffee, monkey bread, breakfast pastries.

I was awake a little after 0600 and made coffee for us in our room.  I slept very well and remembered to be grateful for a warm, dry, bed.  It was already raining.  It's important for me to keep this perspective every day.  The weather forecast was 100% chance of rain with accumulation of 3/4 to 1 inch and temperatures in the 50's.  Too wet and too cold to be comfortable for me so we decided to spend another day off trail.  We hated to leave our lodging at Mountain Harbour Bed and Breakfast but our room wasn't available any longer and we decided it would be fun to experience a different setting anyway.  Ginger arranged for our pickup at the Route 19E road crossing and we were on our way.  As we began hiking toward our rendezvous site, I became aware that my feet and legs hadn't recovered fully from the rush down the mountain that we completed to reach Carver's Gap.  That was another really good reason to rest indoors today and stay warm and dry.  We were picked up by Ann of Roan Mountain Bed and Breakfast and stopped at a little local grocery store for lunch stuff before being delivered to our lodging.  The lady at the register of the grocery told me how the Dollar Store chains were destroying her business because there were so many of them saturating the local area.  I guess it's probably like what happened to many small businesses in these areas when Wal-Mart entered the competition.  I like a bargain as much as anyone but sometimes I forget the real impact of spending patterns on local economies.  
It continued to rain so we decided to take a nap.  That was a great choice and I slept soundly for about an hour.  Maybe I will recover enough to feel strong on the trail tomorrow.  We got takeout dinner and there were several other hikers who arrived during the evening.  They were wet and muddy and I felt kind of guilty for staying warm and dry.  That guilt only lasted a moment as they didn't seem to harbor any resentment or seek any pity.  It was a good evening and we made plans to be shuttled back to Carver's Gap in the morning after breakfast.  It was another beautiful day with my best friend.

I so appreciate how Nathan and I are able to work out our plans together.

We're thoroughly enjoying what these small towns and people have to offer. Really, only the population is small. They are big in so many other ways: like, big-hearted. We overheard Ann helping locate other options for hikers since her place was full; she swerved roadside to pick up a hiker walking to another hostel with groceries.
Roan Mountain is actually Ann's family's house, built on their land in the 1940s. You can see some of the original exterior logs on the outside. The floors look like my place on Hoffman Street. In the common area, she and her husband have displayed black and white photos of the family and house through the years. It still shocks me that folks open their HOMES to strangers and trust us with their personal history. It feels like such a privilege.

Happy Mother's Day!  We mailed gifts to our mothers about a week ago and both felt good about remembering to take care of this detail.  It's easy to get lost in the trail experience and forget that the rest of the world is still living the lives they always did.  I usually have to look at my phone to even know what day of the week it is.  We had a goal of about 12 miles for the day and we left camp at 0910.  That's about normal for us.  We had reasonably easy hiking today.  No huge climbs or descents and we both felt pretty good.  There was a very pretty waterfall that we passed and I enjoyed showing Ginger some new bugs and we took lots of pictures.  We ended up camping on an old logging road near a stream.  It was safe and comfortable and had a good water source.  The only drawback about the site was there wasn't a decent tree to hang our food in within sight.  I finally got our line secured in an old half dead pine tree about 15 feet up but only about 4 feet from the trunk.  The bears could likely get to our food here but at least I was going to make them work for it.  We had a chicken fajita meal with tortillas and some hot sauce I bought at our last resupply.  Our water needs were taken care of and we retired to our tent.  We plan to hike about 15 miles tomorrow and have reservations for a cabin at a highly recommended hostel near the trail.  We'll be up and out earlier tomorrow.  I hear a shower, a good meal, clean clothes, and a soft bed calling me.
From Ginger:
We hit 400 miles today!! We've been going back and forth between North Carolina and Tennessee, but the sign at Doll Flats tells us we are officially leaving N.C. The Appalachians don't recognize state lines, so we were never quite sure which state we were in unless we looked at the guide book. The walk alongside Elk River was especially pretty today. Come summer, these waterways will be fun to dip into.
Today I learned about golden-wing warblers (and saw two cruise by!), spittle bugs -- literally, they create spit, or foam, on a leaf, and saw another little brown snake. Probably a garter. Tiny guy with a pretty pattern. Nathan offered to catch it and let me hold him ... maybe eventually.

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565847,"From Fatboy:We were packed and out of camp by 0810!  The alarm went of at 0600.  Yes, it does take us that long to get on the trail every morning.  I refuse to forgo hot coffee and a hot breakfast.  It's an important reminder for me that our hiking experience may be difficult at times but that's no excuse to not have the things you enjoy.  I didn't sleep very well because I was thinking about how many miles we planned to hike and knew we had a long day of walking. The area we were entering had lots of water sites listed on our maps and we planned on having more food for snacks and lunches because we knew we were going to need the calories.  We hiked, and hiked, and hiked.  There were places where I had a sense of deja vu.  How many mountain views and rhododendron bushes can you see before they generally begin to look alike?  I kept track of our progress with the Guthook app on my phone and Ginger checked off our locations on Awol's guide.  And we hiked.  The final section of our hike passed through areas that were deep green and shaded with a full stream running through the valley.  It was beautiful and cool and had the feel of a spooky movie.  We eventually exited the forest and followed the road that would lead to our cabin.  The final 0.4 miles was walked on pavement.  That sounds like it may be easier than walking a path in the woods but it isn't.  The pavement is hard and each step pounds your aching feet.  Ginger was a good sport about it and never complained but I knew she was hurting too.  We found our hostel and checked in to their best cabin.  This was the place we were told was special by a hiker who had completed this section of the trail in the past.  The cabin was quaint but didn't include any bathroom facilities and the bed was a mattress on a wood bunk frame.  Ginger tried to call a taxi to take us to town so we could eat in a restaurant but there wasn't any cell service either.  The showers were clean and the resupply store had a better than average selection of packaged and frozen foods so we made do.  It was something to laugh about and include in our education about hiker facilities.  We at least had our evening coffees to keep us sane.  It was a good (but tiring) day.From Ginger:We did 14.7 trail miles and 15.1 total. Ouch! This was our highest mileage day yet. The day had several distinct segments, which made it feel even longer. In the morning, we got to chat with a fellow hiker from Roan Mountain B&B. His name is Heel-Toe. We hiked a piece with Solar Fox, who has a camper, which allows him to slack-pack periodically. He hiked in SOCK FEET for a few miles. We played leap frog with two different pairs of gals. The chatter helped pass the long miles. I especially enjoyed a downhill stretch loaded with an aroma I'd describe as lush, fertile and dewy with flowery scents that might be wild rose, honey suckle and/or magnolia. All of it together create a scent I want to roll around in. I inhale deeply and smile in these areas. And try to remember them when I'm dragging ass. Nathan is so patient with me at the end of the day.","Slide Hollow

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565848,"From Fatboy:Sleep was elusive last night.  My legs and feet were screaming at me and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what position I tried to lie in.  There were a couple of hikers who felt the need to abuse a string instrument.  It sounded like a badly out of tune ukulele and a woman was channeling some vintage Cranberries style yodeling as accompaniment in a different key.  It was so bad that we were laughing out loud at intervals but it did help distract us from how badly our legs hurt.  It was cool enough in our cabin that were comfortable with the windows closed to drown out the wailing but I locked the doors just in case.  I've never felt afraid in all of our miles of hiking or all of the places we set up camp but I knew I did not want to meet whoever was making those noises.
I woke up at 0614 and made coffee for us.  Our morning ritual used to involve expensive coffee pods brewed in a space age single cup coffee maker.  Now we're drinking instant granules of whatever single serving variety we can get and we're grateful for that.  The most amazing thing happened during the night.  Both of our legs and feet stopped hurting.  I could walk and even climb and descend stairs without agony.  Lots of ibuprofen probably helped.  We inventoried our supplies and made a list of needs to get us to Damascus and went to the camp store to buy breakfast and do our shopping.  We also were first in line for the wash machine so we only had to wait until the hostel cleared out or 0900 to begin our washing.  I had two Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and egg biscuits and a fruit bar as well as about 4 cups of coffee.  I was still hungry but I knew we were leaving as soon as our laundry was done and our planned section had a really big climb in it.  I didn't want to feel loaded down and was still apprehensive that my legs would return to their screaming at any time.  I found that the store had a bathroom scale.  When I left Texas the last week of February I weighed 234.2 pounds naked, first thing in the morning before breakfast or coffee.  This morning I weighed 214 pounds with my clothes on.  I haven't been this light since I left the military in 1992.  I wouldn't recommend hiking the AT as a weight management regimen.  Join a gym and hire a personal trainer.  It'll cost a lot less, it won't hurt as much, and you'll get to keep all of your toenails.
We left the cabin about 1100 and we're lucky enough to get a ride in the back of a pickup to the trailhead.  That saved us almost half a mile of road walking in the sun and it was a great way to start our day.  The first section of the trail passed near Laurel Falls and included some significant rock stairs and steep scrambles.  It was worth every risked injury to see the falls.  The entire river valley was cool and the air was moist.  It really was quite beautiful and the trail proceeded along a very narrow ridge alongside the river at the edge of some significant cliffs.  The water was crashing over the rocks and made a lot of noise.  I tried to get a photo of Ginger and yelled for her to face me but quickly determined that was a bad idea because I had to yell so loudly that she thought I was alarmed about something.  I did get the photo but the expression on her face wasn't really a smile.  We climbed back to the ridge tops and enjoyed some easy hiking for a while.  Then we began to climb.  We had decided that we were going to have a short day for a couple of reasons.  First, we didn't want to destroy my legs and, second, we needed to avoid camping near Watauga Lake because of bear problems.  Our destination was a little less than 6 miles but included a climb of almost 1000 feet within a couple of miles.  That's something to be wary of with fully supplied packs and sore legs. We did complete the climb and set up camp near a water source in a secluded site with logs for sitting, level ground, and a perfect tree for hanging our food.  It was a score and we were set up by 1800.  We had a special dinner of ramen noodles, mashed potatoes, and cubed Spam.  I added some hot sauce to mine and it really was pretty tasty.  We cleaned up our dishes, hung our bear bag, took care of some hygiene issues and retired to our tent by 1930 to escape the bugs.  Tomorrow we'll easily pass the restricted area with the bear problems.  My legs didn't hurt and it was a great day with my best friend.From Ginger:What a wonderful day! I believe we were both powered by the short day and better nutrition. Loved sharing the falls with Nathan. It's one of our favorite spots so far. FEELING the cool spray was powerful, and getting through that beast of a climb together was a triumph.","Dennis Cove Road + Black Bear Resort

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565865,"From Fatboy:During the night I heard a large animal moving around in the brush near our tent.  I have no idea what it was but the noises woke me and made sleeping soundly during the rest of the night impossible.  I know there are bears in the area but I sure hope that when I see one it's during the daytime.
I woke spontaneously at 0545 and felt rested so I began my morning routine of making coffee and breakfast while Ginger broke down the sleeping pads and began stowing our home.  We were on the trail by 0745 and the weather was beautiful.  Our first major landmark was Watauga Lake and it was in view from the trail for miles before we arrived.  These dammed rivers in Tennessee are spectacular and Watauga was no exception.  We really enjoyed finding the restrooms open and the opportunity to dump our trash.  The lake has a nice recreation area with designated swimming and picnicking facilities.  We sat in the sun at a table and started reviewing our guidebook and my phone app of the trail.  We got hungry for real food so we called a taxi to take us to the dollar store and McDonald's.  We NEVER eat at McDonald's at home but the lure of Big Macs was impossible to ignore today.  Our driver delivered us back to the park and we watched the swimmers and boaters while we ate.  A young woman was sunbathing and had her puppy, Emmy, with her so we had our opportunity to play with a dog for a while.  We really miss our dogs so we take advantage of every chance to play with other hikers dogs we get. The longer we sat at the lake the less we wanted to move.  I soaked my feet in the water and got really relaxed.  We had a short discussion about getting to Damascus and decided we should take advantage of our perfect weather and hike on but we had paused for almost four hours and our muscles weren't happy with our choice.  It was just like starting another morning.  We hiked the northern shore of the lake and eventually crossed the dam.  We took lots of pictures and wondered why we didn't recall mention of this lake or Laurel Falls in any of the trail books we've read.  It was in the 80's with little wind and very humid.  We're used to this type of weather so that wasn't a problem for us.  Some of the other hikers we met were struggling because of the heat.  Our destination was about 8 miles from our lunch spot and the trail had some big climbs for us.  It seemed like we both had a mental let down from pausing so long at the lake and neither of us really enjoyed the afternoon hike much.  The high point of the trail was when Ginger stopped right in the middle of the trail on a climb.  She'd encountered a rather large, shiny black snake (an Indigo?) sunbathing on a bed of leaves to the right of the trail.  I assured her that this was a good snake and tried to get pictures but only managed to get a shot of its tail as it scurried into the brush. We hiked on but with a little extra attention to the snake shapes we found among the roots crossing the trail.  We reached Vandeventer Shelter at about 1845 and set up to sleep in the shelter.  We were exhausted and wanted to do the minimal work required.  We had Mountain House Beef Stroganoff for dinner and it was delicious.  Each if us had a ""2-serving"" pouch and that still wasn't much food.  Our calorie requirements when we're hiking are enormous and it's a challenge to get enough energy some times.  We drink lots of electrolyte drinks but are always almost dehydrated too.  I hung the bear bag and we spent a good evening talking with other hikers.  This was an exceptionally nice group of men and I really enjoyed hearing some of their stories.  It was a hard but fun day.From Ginger:I felt like a regular resident of Hampton, TN, with our stop at Watauga Lake. When we arrived around 10:30, the area was empty but for us and two fisherman kayakers. It was so peaceful. I couldn't believe it wasn't overrun with visitors. By 2:30, when we reluctantly left, it wasn't overrun, but you could tell this was a popular spot. As we hiked on, we learned that the lake is monstrous. There is no shortage of private inlets or of ""beach"" space. What I loved about our little space was that it was right off the trail. I'm glad Nathan is game for respites like this. Hearing trendy country music that I knew the words to, playing with a dog, sitting in the sunshine with Nathan ... we could have been any couple enjoying the outdoors. I forgot about the heavy pack laying nearby. Emmy is a terrier-whippet mix, much like our Pete.Today's nature lesson -- besides the large snake! -- was about a mitten-like leaf: Sassafras! We've been across umpteen mountains and gaps (and campsites and shelters) named for the plant. Now I know what it looks and smells like. A bit like lemon. I like it! Also, it was Toad City at dusk as beautiful views from Vandeventer shelter faded into the night. Pretty funny to watch grown men follow and chase toads with their video cameras. We enjoyed talking with Just Matt and the foursome that included Lucky Rooster. Hoping to see them in Damascus.","Pond Flats tent site

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565867,"From Fatboy:Sleep was elusive last night.  We shared the shelter with 4 other hikers and it was a symphony!  It's all part of the deal but it can be frustrating at times.  I was up by 0545 and dressed to get water from the spring that was down a side trail.  It was WAY DOWN a side trail.  I wore my hiking shoes (instead of my Crocs), my puffy jacket (because the pockets are huge), and took my trekking poles.  All those things were good choices because this was the steepest and most difficult water access I've seen on the trail yet.  It required at least 30 minutes for the round trip and there was even a tent site near the bottom of the side trail.  I did return with a gallon of water so we had enough for our big coffees and a full oatmeal breakfast.  It was worth the trip.
We left camp at 0855 with the destination of a road crossing about 11 miles away.  We planned to find a ride to Damascus, Va. for Trail Days and some much needed recuperation and attention to hygiene.  The lack of access to bathing and clean, dry, clothing isn't just a personal preference for me.  I get rashes that are very uncomfortable and could make it impossible for me to continue on the trail, because of infection, if I stay wet and dirty for too long.  Ginger had a rough afternoon yesterday and didn't want to lead our hike today.  She's really good a setting our pace so that I don't pound my feet to pulp by going too fast on the climbs and flats.  I was in the lead and we hiked with a focus on clean bodies, clean sheets, and good food.  We hiked over 11 miles in 6 1/2 hours.  That's a record pace for us but it should be noted that the last 6 miles was the easiest terrain of any section of the trail we've completed to date.  We paused frequently for water and snacks because the temperature was in the 80's and we had clear skies.  I was soaked with sweat but I guess all of the years I've lived on the South Texas coast were good conditioning for that because it didn't really slow us down.  We didn't have a plan for transportation from the highway crossing to Damascus but thought we'd hitchhike or call a shuttle.  I noticed a couple of cars parked near the trailhead as we exited the woods and a young man stepped out of one of the cars and asked me if we needed a ride to Trail Days.  Ginger and I were offered a ride before we'd even crossed the parking lot!  Trail magic is indisputable.  The two hikers who gave us the ride told us their story.  They are thru hikers who started the trail in Georgia at Amicalola Falls in early March and had left their car there.  They had just returned from picking their car up after they hitchhiked for 2 days needing 11 rides to get back to their car.  Then they decided to go to our particular road crossing to see if anyone needed a ride.  They had literally just pulled into the parking lot!  I'm beginning to think I should play the lottery.  They took us to Damascus and dropped us off in front of the B&B where we had reservations for tomorrow night.  The sign on the door said there was no vacancy so we decided to walk down the street to get something to eat and plan our next move.  We called the B&B just to see if there was a vacancy and left a voice message as we loaded up our packs and started down the sidewalk.  We were less than 50 yards away when my phone rang and the B&B owner notified me that we could have our room a day early.  Our lodging was arranged and we were on our way to hot showers and clean sheets.  I don't always have fortunate occurrences in my life but currently I'm charmed and very grateful.From Ginger:Nathan led us to the highway crossing at a kick ass pace. I'll admit, sometimes I just want to get there. I've had a few mental-struggle days lately. We were there by 3:30, fueled by an on-the-go lunch with a caffeine pill and ibuprofen. And we still stopped for a nature lesson: Today, Nathan pointed out a hickory tree, nut and hull. It'll be easy to remember the tree, with its shaggy, ""hairy"" look.Once we arrived at Dancing Bear B&B, I selected a crocheted hat made by the trail angels of Kempsville Baptist Church. There were numerous BOXES of hats, with varying sizes, shapes and colors. Imagine all the work those ladies put into making these donations. Everywhere I looked, I saw someone wearing one of them. Men and women. Even Princess Bear Cub, our generous driver into Damascus, was wearing a purple one she'd picked up earlier. Also had a fascinating conversation with a church deacon and Sunday school teacher named Bobby. If he led the class locally, I'd have sat in this weekend. Alas, they based in Virginia Beach. With this start to the weekend festivities, I'm glad we came.","Vandeventer shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565868,"From Fatboy:It was wonderful to sleep in a real bed and have a bathroom just steps away.  One of my bigger challenges has been standing upright from lying on the ground first thing in the morning.  My knees don't want to function correctly until I've been awake for a while.  Beds and chairs that are elevated from ground level are a blessing which I will never take for granted again.
I made coffee and served Ginger in bed.  That's my favorite way to wake up and she's always grateful and starts my day with a great smile.  We dressed and walked to the fire department for the fundraiser breakfast featuring biscuits with sausage gravy, sausage, eggs, OJ, and coffee.  It was served in the big garage bays where the trucks are usually parked and we saw some friends we'd passed on the trail.  Foghat showed up!  It was great to see him and reconnect.  He's about 50 miles ahead of us and it's unlikely we'll ever catch up with him after this weekend.  We will see. After breakfast we went to a large tent for foot massages and free socks that were provided by the Kempsville Baptist Church.  This church has been providing trail magic in Damascus for 9 years and they drive 7 1/2 hours to get here.  It felt indescribably good to have my feet massaged with lotion.  I almost fell asleep!  They even gave each of us new Farm to Feet socks which are made of high grade wool and are very comfortable.  The whole experience was a wonderful treat and was very humbling.  I believe that I'm a good man but I've never dedicated that much of myself to the comfort of strangers.  They really are living their convictions and very sincere in their mission.  We then began exploring the vendors' offerings and I spent a lot of time people-watching.  I'll bet that any crowd this size has some free spirits but hikers seem to take it to a new level.  There were lots of tattoos, piercings, beards, men in dresses, and women with buzzed heads, etc.  It was really a freak show and very entertaining.  We continued to see people who we'd crossed paths with and enjoyed many happy reunions and smiling faces.
We enjoyed salads with our lunch.  Eating something that requires a fork is fun because almost all trail food is spoon and bowl style.  It can be delicious but it's almost always lacking texture.  Ginger was on the search for a new pack and had multiple options to choose from.  The vendors are unusually helpful and often are the designers and manufacturers of their unique products.  Her old pack was huge and heavy so it was definitely time for an upgrade in technology.  The hiking industry seems to have benefited from huge advances in fabric technology and offers big advantages in comfort and weight savings.  You can spend a lot of money shaving grams from your load which will improve your comfort with every step.  The trail adventure is difficult enough without being punished by a painful pack or the wrong shoes.  Ginger did buy a new pack and it was fun watching her organize and adjust her load to best meet her needs.  She REALLY enjoys the organizational aspect of hiking and she's also really good at it.  I took my pack to the manufacturer's tent so they could repair the waist belt.  I carry an Osprey pack, which is one of the most popular packs on the trail.  The trouble is: the waist belt adjustment kept slipping because it had a Velcro adjustment that wouldn't hold with big loads under high exertion.  They must have experienced the same issue with many hikers because the service representative understood immediately what the issue was and knew how to fix it.  I left my pack with them and he assured me it would be ready in the morning.  We looked at lots of equipment and talked to a lot of people.  We even had our photo taken for the hiker yearbook.  That'll be fun to see all of the pictures of this strange cross section of humanity in one book.  My legs began to hurt a lot so I went back to the room to get off my feet for a while.  The interesting thing about being off the trail is you still do a lot more walking than most anyone else.  Towns aren't usually designed to be really pedestrian-friendly and often the centers of towns aren't where the desirable stores are located.  We met Foghat for dinner and attended a screening of a documentary movie about a Viet Nam vet who hiked the trail and returned to Viet Nam to find personal closure to his war experiences.  It was a powerful emotional experience for me and I thanked him for sharing his experience.  I've come to believe that wars would never be fought if old men had to do the fighting.
I was exhausted, full, tired, and emotionally drained by this point.  Back to the B&B for some much appreciated rest.  It was a good day.From Ginger:One or both of us greeted nearly every person we've met by name along the trail here in Damascus! Not everyone could make it, and, notably, we both missed Tequila Sunshine and Happy Feet tremendously, but I was surprised by how many people we knew by name here. It's been a heartwarming reunion even with people we only spent a night or two with. I'll be retiring my backpack purchased in 2000 or 2001. My new one from a company called Elemental Horizons weighs next to nothing when empty. I was impressed with the couple's presentation, their testing methods, his engineering and the time they spent with me. It'll take some time adjusting to a new way of packing but the weight change will be worth it. My original pack weighed 5 or 6 pounds empty. That's unheard of these days.","Damascus

We were shuttled back to TN91 about 20 miles south of Damascus to resume our journey and started walking about 1000.  The terrain was easy and we traveled 11.3 miles to end our day at Abingdon Shelter at about 1700.  Spam and mashed potatoes was our dinner and we retired to sleep in the shelter.  We have a short day planned for tomorrow and we'll try to get started early so we can avoid the likelihood of rain tomorrow afternoon.","Damascus, VA - Woodchuck Hostel

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565872,"From Fatboy:We had one of the most peaceful nights in a shelter yet.  There was minimal snoring and no one slept on one of those horribly loud air pads.  It was nice to get a decent rest.  There were reports of bear sightings very close to the shelter but nothing seemed out of place in the morning.  We started our day with coffee and oatmeal with fruit as usual after a long trek down the hill to get water.  The piped spring was way down a steep hill but not as difficult as the water source from Vandeventer Shelter.  We started hiking at 0910 leaving No Name sleeping in the shelter. 
I had discussed the distance from Abingdon Shelter with a hiker last night and told her the distance was 7.1 miles to Woodchuck Hostel.  There's a glitch on the Guthook app that I wasn't aware of.  If something is directly on the trail you get accurate trail mileage.  If a feature (Woodchuck Hostel) isn't directly on trail you get line of sight mileage.  The accurate distance from Abington Shelter to Woodchuck Hostel is closer to 10.5 miles.  I feel badly that I gave her information that was in error of about 50%.  If I meet her again I will definitely make my amends.
The day started overcast and cool but without rain and we knew that was supposed to change so we set out at a faster pace than usual.  The terrain was almost flat and the trail was clear for the most part.  We hiked about 5 miles within the first 2 hours!  The rain started as a light shower and just kept building.  It was eventually pouring rain and the trail was a shallow creek in places.  Ginger's boots are waterproof so her feet stayed dry.  My shoes aren't waterproof and my feet were quickly soaked.  I was very grateful the temperature was warm enough that I wasn't cold as long as we kept moving.  We passed an old unlisted shelter (on Awol's guide) that was constructed using log cabin technique but the structure had developed a significant tilt and wasn't currently being maintained.  We did pass the sign showing the final trail crossing of the state line and we paused for some funny posed photos to commemorate our fourth state.  The trail continued mostly flat until the last mile or so and we were passing the miles quite quickly.  We heard the traffic a long time before we saw the road, as usual, partly because the end of Damascus nearest the northbound trail crossing is right on a sharp turn that requires all of the trucks to shift gears creating lots of truck noise.  It was wonderful to turn the last corner on the trail and see the entrance to town.  It was still raining hard but I felt a lot better knowing I would be in a warm and dry bed tonight.  Ginger was swinging her poles and almost skipping down the trail in this lousy weather and her joy was infectious.  We'd hiked over 10 miles in about 5 hours and my feet and legs were shouting at me in protest.  We checked in with Woodchuck, took showers and arranged for the shuttle to the grocery store at 1700.  Woodchuck gave us discount cards for the grocery store that were a great benefit.  We saved over 20% on our purchases!  This kind of detail of hiker service is what separates the best hostels from many of the other lodging facilities we've stayed with over our journey.  Woodchuck continues to provide one of the best no-frills places we've found on the trail.  We had salads and real bread with mustard for our sandwiches for dinner and retired to our cozy cabin very tired but grateful.  It was a wonderful happy hike today.From Ginger:No Name explained the whole hammock process for me last night. So interesting! I've been wanting to peek into one for months and try to watch folks put them up, but I hadn't actually asked anyone. He walked us through it.

As a kid, I only lived in Virginia for 2.5 years (we lived in Hampton while Dad was stationed at Langley), but until I got to Texas, I thought of Virginia as home.

We decided to stay another day in Damascus. Forecast called for rain -- 80 percent chance. None so far, but I don't second-guess decisions we make with the best information available. If it doesn't rain, we get to enjoy dry feet while walking around Damascus.
This is a sweet town, infinitely walkable, with a beautiful public library. I know because I spent several hours here yesterday and am back with Nathan today to update our journal. I'm so glad these still exist. At home, I appreciate the free book checkouts. On the road, I enjoy seeing how each individual branch is organized, and I'm glad so many offer computer use. There's only so much I want to do via iPhone. Thanks for being so welcoming and accommodating, Damascus Librarians! From what I overhear at the main desk, you are used and appreciated by your local folks, too.
Woodchuck is full for the night, so we'll try our luck over at The Place, run by or out of the Methodist church here. Nathan is breaking in new boots -- waterproof like mine -- and I think it's time for a coffee boost from Mojo's. My treat this time since he's brought me coffee in bed several days in a row.
From Fatboy (evening):
Another rainy day!  Damascus is in a wet weather pattern that's making it very difficult for us to leave.  I'm forced to admit how much I despise cold, wet, gray weather.  Ginger went to the library to post all of my ramblings and her wisdom on our journal and I stayed in our cabin and napped.  At least I wasn't walking around stressing my feet and legs more.  I did buy new hiking shoes after I discovered how much damage my old shoes had accumulated.  The tops were beginning to tear away from the soles on the inside of each shoe near the balls of my feet.  I didn't ask how long these shoes would last when I bought them, but I should have.  I never considered how much stress and damage this journey could cause to my feet and legs.  I'm learning the hard way.  
We moved to The Place (hostel run by the Methodist Church) because Woodchuck had reservations for all of his spaces and we needed to vacate.  The Place has communal bunkrooms where you use your own bedding and sleeping pads.  This is kind of a problem for us because we have a double bag and the bunks are singles.  Ginger kept the bag and I wrapped up in all of my clothes and a sheet the caretaker provided.  The hostel wasn't heated very much so we all sat around in the evening in our jackets and hats.  I am warm enough but I missed sleeping beside my wife.  I'm looking forward to being back in our home (tent) and making progress on the trail tomorrow.

We met No Name here and had a pleasant evening indoors, under the watchful eye of Bayou. He runs a tight ship! Lights out and quiet times are strictly enforced, which is welcome with a large group of varied personalities and routines. There ended up being about 14 people here overnight. The house is 120 years old. I'm grateful people like Bayou have taken their caretaker role so seriously! This place is open only to long-distance AT hikers and Trans-American cyclists. When you agree to stay here, you pledge, while in the house, no drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, no profanity. Coffee doesn't count as an illegal substance, thankfully, and they offered a microwave, so we stayed warm and dry and caffeinated, playing Trivial Pursuit (cards only), reading or knitting (just me!). We took a picture of the church info so we can donate to their funds once home. We'd like to help places like this keep going.","Damascus, VA - Woodchuck Hostel

I didn't sleep much but we were under roof, warm, clean, and dry.  I finally got tired of flopping around in my bunk and got up at 0545 and made instant coffee in the microwave with tap water. It certainly was easier than firing up my stove and boiling spring water that I have to filter.  I remembered to be grateful for small things.  I woke Ginger at 0700 with coffee and she smiled.  That's one of the best parts of my day.  We were out of the hostel by 0900 and began our hike out of Damascus.  The weather was perfect and it was time to go.  We stopped for a big breakfast and we're joined by No Name so we had some good laughs as we prepared to enter the forest again.  My new shoes were feeling ok.  Not great but feeling like they were going to be better after a few trail miles.  There's only one way to find out. 
We stopped a couple of times so I could take my shoes off and rub my feet.  That always feels good but my legs tighten up while I'm sitting, so it's a mixed blessing.  We finished up at Saunders Shelter and called it an early day at about 1645.  I was done!  We had a cup of bouillon and beef stroganoff (and I added sourdough pretzels) for dinner.  It was a lot of salt but it was quite tasty.  
I met a man who was hiking with his two sons.  He was 70 and had injured his foot.  I introduced myself and told him my background and he let me wrap his foot with an ace wrap.  I suggested he rest and elevate his foot as much as possible.  His one son asked me in private if he would be able to complete their section hike.  I offered my professional opinion of his injury but also suggested he would be the only person who could decide how much pain he could tolerate.  If I were 70 and hiking with my two kids it would likely take a very significant injury to make me leave the trail.  How many opportunities can you count on for a gift like spending this kind of time with your kids?  I've been hiking most of this trip with feet and legs that hurt enough that most people would likely have given up long ago.  I wouldn't miss this chance to share this experience with Ginger for anything.  It was a beautiful day with sunny skies.  This is as good as it gets.
From Ginger:
Today the trail was covered with green leaves from all the wind and rain we had. AAAAAAND, we saw quite a few AMERICAN chestnut trees! I now can differentiate them from Chinese chestnuts. Several of the American chestnuts were actual trees, not just saplings or small bushes. The rhododendrons have started blooming finally. Many of the blooms made brief carpets of petals from all the recent wind.
The climb to Saunders shelter was a steep on -- shades of Unaka Mountain, without the stone-crafted steps or blazing sun. I felt terrific. Nathan's breaking in new shoes and says he feels less than terrific right now, but improving.
This shelter area offers many flat, soft tenting spots, some in a small meadow, others under pine tree cover with beds of fallen needles.
Today we also met Kiote, Foxy, Doc and Dexter the dog.
And we watched a guy throw a line for his bear bag with his Croc. Bet we'll be talking about that one for a while. What happens if the Croc gets stuck, like we've seen so many rocks, sticks, bags and socks do?! ","The Place -- Damascus, VA

We were both very tired but happy we had made camp and retired to our tent before the rain started at 2000.From Ginger:Our stop for lunch at Lost Moutain shelter included good conversation, too, not just mileage boasts from folks. That seems to be waning as numbers on the trail wane. Or we're in a mature mini-bubble right now.We expected rain all day and could see the heavy clouds looming much of the day. As we climbed to Buzzard Rock, I kept hoping it would hold off, and it did. I think we both felt like the ascent was rewarding. The boulder formation itself and the view were breath-taking.

We had our usual amazing breakfast and Ginger made coffee for us.  I'm spoiled by her attentiveness but I love it anyway.  We started hiking around 0800 and had some amazing trail sights to pass through.  We continued to see evidence of ponies and eventually cattle too.  The weather cleared and we were gifted with beautiful sunshine as the mist and clouds below our elevation blew away.  The rocky mountain tops and greenery made for a constantly changing view so the miles passed quickly.  We did go through Fatman Squeeze, a famous rock tunnel that the AT goes through.  It's not really a squeeze or maybe I'm not as fat as I was 500 miles ago!  Our planned destination was Massie Gap and a shuttle to the Grayson Store and Inn.  We reached the gap and Dennis, the owner of the inn, picked us up quickly and brought us back to his inn.  We were in for a treat. The general store was filled with eclectic food and hiker resupply staples as well as general everyday stuff the local residents might need.  The restaurant was a treat too.  Our barbecue shredded chicken sandwiches were delicious and we ate other foods until we were fueled enough to climb the stairs to our room.  This place is a gem.  The rooms are very clean and well-decorated and Dennis provides all the services you could want.  We'll be back. After showers and a nap we had dinner from their short-order menu and sampled Dennis' homemade zucchini bread.  Dennis even shared some of his Indian mango pickle and chutney he makes because he loves to cook Indian food.  I bought some more food for our room, and we were set to relax for the night.  Ginger did our laundry and I relaxed in our room.  Life is good and we feel justified in a celebration after hiking 500 miles into Virginia.From Ginger:Hikers call this a near-o: hiking a few miles into a town or resupply spot, then spending the night there and getting back on trail the next day.Our walk before arriving at Dennis' gem in the Grayson Highlands was jam-packed with beauty. We've yet to see ""flat Virginia,"" but I'll take this! Lush green paths around monstrous boulders (it looks like Ireland or Scotland), a bit of rock-climbing before and after Fatman Squeeze, cool breezes without whipping winds ...We walked a bit with Kiote Jayne and shared a shuttle down the mountain.

The trail passed over some meadows where ponies and cattle pasture and through a lot of scrubby brush areas and returned to the forest.  The amazing thing to us is the number of rocky areas.  Virginia was supposed to be flat and easy!  Again, the only easy hikes are in the past.  My feet and legs take a beating while walking on rocks and I tire after only a few miles.  We finished our day at Old Orchard Shelter after a little more than 8 miles.  It was a beautiful sunny day and we decided we both could enjoy stopping before we were in agony from trashing our feet.  We set up our tent in a shaded spot and completed our usual evening routine of getting water, making coffee, and having dinner.  Spam and garlic mashed potatoes was a good choice and really tasted good.  We were treated to a brief thunderstorm with a little rain but decided to stay with our plan of tenting instead of moving into the shelter.  I hope it isn't raining in the morning when we pack up but the positive is this section of Virginia has the nicest privies we've seen yet.  That's always a huge plus for me.  I hung our bear bag and we retired to our tent at 1830 to read and write.  It was a great day.From Ginger:We stopped for lunch at Wise Shelter, where there were TWO privies! Nathan and I could each use one! You're spoiling us, AT! We also checked out the shelter log. Happy Feet left us a note when he came through. That'll pick up your spirits to see!

It was big day with great, long climbs that felt exhilarating to push through. Nathan has been HUUUUNGRY lately. He's dropped a considerable amount of weight. We supplemented his serving of a Mountain House Thai dinner with other fuel, which I hope helps. He and I don't eat the same way off-trail, and we can't eat the same way on-trail.

The alarm didn't wake me at 0600 because I forgot to turn it ON.  We did get up at 0612 and started our usual morning stuff.  The rain stopped some time during the night so our tent was only a little wet and we had breakfast and packed up with only the water dropping from the canopy in the breeze.  We left camp at 0843.  Early for us!  Our plan for the day was to hike to the Mt. Rogers visitor center to get a shuttle at 1430.  We needed to hike 10 miles in a little more than 5 1/2 hours.  That's pushing the pace a little for me and I knew I'd need to be careful to not hyperextend my knees.  The most common way that happens is when I'm hurrying on a descent trail that has loose rocks or mud.  When I do it, I pay the price of really painful and swollen knees.  My patella tendon compression straps help hold things together but it still makes me cuss.  The trail was really nice and we made excellent progress.  We even were met on the AT by some horseback riders who couldn't find their road crossing.  I was able to help because I have the Guthook App on my phone.  The horses were beautiful and the riders thanked us for the assistance.  We saw very few other hikers today but we did see the man who'd given us some trail magic yesterday because he liked Ginger's hair.  He was hiking southbound and we paused briefly to chat.  Ginger was a little uncomfortable with the type of attention she was getting from him and I thought it was a little strange too.  She kept turning around and checking behind us to see if he was following.  Our six stayed clear and we made it to Partnership Shelter and the Mt. Rogers visitor center before 1400.  We made it on time but we were both tired and had sore feet.  The reward was: There are real bathrooms with sinks and soap and vending machines at the visitors center.  It was a joy to wash my face and hands and feel almost human again.  We waited a short while for our shuttle and had fun talking with other hikers who were going to town too.  We made it to the Econolodge in Marion, Va. and settled in to a room with a king bed and all the luxuries I'd been hoping for.  After showers we went to Pizza Hut for salad and pasta (it was delicious) and then walked to Wal-Mart for some necessities like instant coffee packs and sugary snacks for our room tonight.  We plan on a complete zero tomorrow and my feet need the rest.

There's a shelter within sight of the visitor center and we were greeted by trail friends as we neared the shelter.  We also were told that Ginger's admirer from the other day was hiking sections today and had been at the shelter earlier.  That was a little creepy so we decided to get out of the area quickly.  By this time it was about 1500 and we knew the next shelter was about 8 miles away but that was our goal.  This section of trail was quite hilly with several steep climbs and lots of rocky areas.  Lots of rocks.  Lots.  Painful to walk on rocks that we kept recrossing on switchback.  We eventually reached our destination and shared the shelter with some really interesting hikers.  Powder, Snacks, and Greg all had interesting stories and sore feet from the rocks.  I did have the opportunity to soak my feet in a very cold creek while I gathered our water.  That felt wonderful.  We had a small dinner because neither of us was very hungry and we retired when it became dark enough to need headlamps.

We were on our way by 0820.  The call of a lunch buffet at the Barn was a powerful incentive.  The trail leaving the shelter was dramatically different.  There were almost no rocks and the hiking started out quite level and easy.  We arrived at the restaurant at 1055 and settled in for a real food lunch.  The menu wasn't fancy but the salad bar was filled with fresh ingredients and there was hot peach cobbler for dessert and all the sweet tea I wanted.  We finished lunch at about noon and sat on the grass near a fence line in the sun behind the restaurant to relax for a while while our meal settled.  It was glorious to take my shoes and socks off and feel the grass on the soles of my bruised feet.  We were on our way again at 1400 but didn't have a definite destination.  I always vote for places with privies but this section of trail had a longer than usual gap between shelters so I knew we would likely be camping at a place without a privy.  The trail crossed a railroad track and several pastures as well as some interesting marshy places with elevated boardwalks.  Some of the trail had actually been maintained with a mower of some type.  The smell was like freshly cut hay and reminded me of my days living on a farm.  We paused at a camp site where a shelter used to be and a privy remained.  We'd passed a couple of trail signs marking 25% and Quarter Way and recorded the appropriate photos.  I was fooling with my phone when I noted a hostel called the Quarter Way and decided this was an omen so we had to try it.  We were able to phone for reservations so our destination was set.  We had about 8 miles to go at 1500 but we also had the lure of showers and a breakfast tomorrow with cheese grits.  I was stoked and we hiked on.  If someone had told me six months ago that starting an 8 mile hike with a full pack at 1500 was reasonable I would have questioned their sanity.  We're not insane but our perspective has definitely changed!  The last few miles were a real challenge because both of us were very tired and our feet were getting really sore.  The trail included some pretty significant climbs and the required significant descents.  Thankfully there weren't very many tough rock patches.  We tend to hike in silence when we're hurting.  Each of us dealing with the challenge in our own way.  Sometimes it isn't fun but it's always rewarding to feel the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.  The last 0.8 miles was on a newly paved road.  It was smooth but walking on black top after 15 miles on the trail is pretty hard on the legs too.  We finally arrived at Quarter Way Hostel and we're greeted by Chunky and got settled in. The hostel is a renovated farm house and Chunky knows exactly how to make you feel at home.  Showers and then food were appreciated as well as meeting old and new friends.  Cash Back and Tunnel Rat were already here and our reunion was fun.  We relaxed for a while and then retired to our private room when the sun went down.  We'd walked 15.5 miles and enjoyed one of our most beautiful days on the trail yet.
From Ginger:
We had wonderfully soft terrain this morning. No rocks before our stop at The Barn!
En route, we stopped at Lindamood School, a single-room historic schoolhouse. I'll have to examine photos we took with Nathan's phone for the details, but I believe it was built in 1894 and used until the 1930s. I'm in awe that people trust us with using this building. We got to learn about education in that era, from the posted history and rules. A Methodist church in the area supplies the site with special trail magic inside. We almost skipped the school because it was Sunday. Since the adjacent Settlers Museum was closed, we assumed the schoolhouse would be, too. Another hiker shouted to us to go in. So glad we did.

We were packed and hiking by 0815.  I hadn't slept much but GInger slept peacefully all night.  She has the most amazing ability to fall asleep almost anywhere.  I'm envious but also grateful.  I mean, what would be the point in both of us being exhausted from lack of sleep.  
The view looking north from the meadow beside Chestnut Knob Shelter was stunning.  The valley below us was covered with low clouds or mist and the sun was shining with clear rays of beauty on all we could see.  I captured a few photos to help me remember and to share with friends but I know the pictures will never come close to what we really saw.  I guess that's why we're here hiking this trail instead of sitting at home looking at pictures.
Our hearts weren't really in hiking this morning and it was obvious we both wanted to be off the trail again.  I searched on Guthook and found a hostel that offered shuttle service from a near road crossing.  We agreed on this change of plans and our pace increased with the thoughts of showers, food, clean clothes, food, a real bed, and food.  After a brief wait at the road a truck appeared.  More like it splattered into the zone.  This truck had floorboards hanging off it on one side and no tailgate.  The noises coming from the undercarriage made me skeptical it would successfully complete a descent of the mountain but beggars can't be choosers and we hopped aboard.  I was beginning to get an uncomfortable vibe about our lodging plan but decided to attempt positive thoughts.  We rode down the mountain on a gravel road and were delivered to the doorstep of a large old fashioned farm house.  There really wasn't a lot of organization evident anywhere but I continued hoping good things would appear.  We quickly discovered that this was a cash only business and we were short of funds.  We did some quick calculations and decided this hostel just wasn't for us.  There were indications that this was a party place and we didn't come to the trail to party. We don't judge those who do but it just isn't our choice.  We called for a shuttle, made our apologies to the management of the hostel and we're shuttled to Bland, Va., for a stay in an old fashioned motel.  It was clean and the room had a mix of vintage and yard sale furnishings.  I was happy to be in close proximity to several food establishments and have the option of delivery pizza and salad.  This was everything I needed and we were happy to settle for a quiet restful night.","Chestnut Knob shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568613,"From Fatboy:Zero days are usually a lot of fun.  There's the novelty of being in a new place and the luxuries of coffee in bed and exploring the local area.  We walked to what appeared to be the center of Bland and had breakfast in a restaurant located in a gas station.  The food was good with big servings and reasonable prices.  They served some of the biggest, fluffiest pancakes I've ever seen!  We went to the grocery store and bought salad stuff for dinner and we stopped at Dollar General and resupplied our food and also bought a beard trimmer.  I was beginning to look homeless and was badly in need of some grooming.  There was a wonderful lady named Melissy who we'd spoken to briefly at the restaurant who pulled in to the Dollar store parking lot and offered us a ride back to our hotel.  These random acts of kindness happen more often than I would have thought possible and I'm always grateful.  We napped for a while in the afternoon after I mowed my beard and went to Wytheville with Angie (the lady who worked at the front desk of the hotel) and Bubba (the shuttle driver who is married to Angie.)  They were going to Wal-Mart and offered us a ride so I could look for a knee brace.  I may walk funny sometimes but if there's a way for me to patch my legs together so I can keep hiking I'm going to try it.  They dropped us at the Dairy Queen near the hotel and I got some special blizzard they're making that's filled with Reese's peanut butter stuff and candy too.  It was delicious!  Ginger says she's had enough Blizzards for a lifetime and was able to find a fruit alternative and seemed to enjoy that instead.  We finished our day in a quiet room with a comfortable bed.  It was great.","Big Walker Motel -- Bland, VA

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568614,From Fatboy:We had coffee in bed and then walked to Dairy Queen for breakfast.  Not spectacular but filling.  We spoke to Bubba and asked about a ride back to the trail.  He was going to be busy so we were offered a ride by Trina (a lady who works at the hotel.)  We were back hiking by 1100 and the weather couldn't have been more perfect.  It was clear and warm and the hiking was good.  We met a couple of other hikers and had brief conversations.  One man stopped and asked me if I was a veteran.  I sometimes wear a camo baseball cap that has a flag patch.  He thanked me for my service and that always makes me feel good.  I remember the way some of our veterans were treated when they returned from Vietnam and I'm glad those incidents are mostly in the past.  We were also passed by another hiker who was grumbling about the trail markers not being clear enough.  Some people seem to be able to find something to complain about no matter what.  The day continued with wonderful weather and we stopped at a shelter for a lunch break.  The grumbler from this morning was having lunch there also and she continued with her grumbling and negative comments.  The only positive comments she shared were about the hostel we'd avoided two days ago.  Taste is subjective.  Our hike began on a high note today but ended somewhat down.  Ginger developed sore feet and was tired and in pain over the last few miles.  We tried to stop before Jenny Knob Shelter but the water sources were dry and we wouldn't have enough for dinner or coffee.  We finally arrived at Jenny Knob and decided to tent.  The water source was only a trickle but we did have water so we were grateful to have our needs met for the day.  Tomorrow will bring its own challenges but today we were successful and happy.,"Bland, VA

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568615,"From Fatboy:When we went to bed there were only 5 hikers at the shelter but a group of hikers came into the area around Jenny Knob Shelter late in the night.  They had two-way radios and made quite a bit of noise for a little while but I went to sleep soon after and only noticed some snoring later.  I woke at 0515 and stepped out of our tent to find tents everywhere.  I mean everywhere!  There were about a dozen new tents that hadn't been there when I went to bed.  Our late night arrival was a Boy Scout Troop of 11 scouts and 5 leaders from Raleigh, North Carolina.  Ginger and I were out of bed shortly after 0600 and it was entertaining to watch the scouts pack up and get ready to hike.  They were just kids but they had good equipment and mostly seemed to know what they were doing.  I spoke with a couple of the adults to warn them about the scarcity of water on the trail because they were headed south.  They were appreciative of the information and left camp soon after.  We actually started hiking at 0730!  The early wake-up from the scouts had us moving earlier than usual.  We had the goal of Trent's Grocery Store 6 1/2 miles up the trail for lunch.  We arrived at Trent's before noon and had good cheeseburgers with fries for lunch.  We also met up with Cash Back, King Cake, Tunnel Rat, and Red in front of the store.  It was good to see each and Tunnel Rat told us about Dismal Falls and the good tenting in the vicinity.  The way he described it we had to go. We hiked to the Dismal Falls side trail and descended toward the falls.  The area was everything Tunnel Rat described and had the added benefit of a good swimming hole at the falls.  We selected a tent site and made our camp before we walked a short distance to the creek so I could swim.  The water was frigid and the cold on my feet and legs felt really good.  I didn't really swim but I cleaned my body in the cold water and washed out my stinking clothes.  It was glorious!  This was the type of experience I hoped to have on this hike and it was finally happening.  I laid my clothes out on bushes to dry and really enjoyed sitting in the sun in my wet underwear talking with Ginger and other hikers.  We gathered our water and went back to our camp and had coffee and dinner of Spam and garlic mashed potatoes.  Delicious and filling.  We hung our food in a bear bag and retired to our tent to read and write and escape the bugs.  We plan to make it to Woods Hole Hostel tomorrow so we need to rest up for a long day.","Jenny Knob shelter

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568617,"From Fatboy:
It was almost difficult to leave this camp because it was so nice.  The sound of the falls was wonderful and peaceful and this was my all-time favorite camp site.  We needed to move on to accomplish our goal of Woods Hole Hostel about 14 miles away.  We started hiking at 0830 in a beautiful hot summer day.  This is the AT experience I was hoping for.  The trail was marvelous.  This must be the flat Virginia we'd heard about.  There was one climb about 7 miles in that was big.  We gained about 1500 feet in elevation in less than 2 miles.  It was mostly straight up a rocky wash and never excessively difficult.  It was just the grind of putting one foot in front of the other and repeat several thousand times.  The last couple of miles before the road leading to Woods Hole were different.  This section was filled with rough rocky sections that always seem to conspire to bruise your feet and twist your ankles.  Why do we always hit these conditions near the end of our day when we're both exhausted and my knees are weak?  It is what it is.  There were a couple of exceptionally challenging passages that required big steps down on rocks or roots that slowed me to a complete stop.  We've heard from several friends recently about injuries that have forced them to either quit the trail or be laid up for extended periods of time and I don't want to end my adventure that way.  Ginger has a bigger challenge with these obstacles because she's so much shorter than me but she never complains and just figures out how to pass even if it requires sitting down and scooting to be safe.  She continues to amaze me with her sense of adventure and ability to maintain a positive outlook on life and keep smiling.  This is the hardest thing I've ever done, both physically and mentally, and she is always right up front, leading the way.  I'm blessed to have her in my life.
We arrived at Woods Hole a little after 1700.  What a neat place!  We were given an orientation to the rules for staying and were both really impressed by the atmosphere.  We were shown to our room.  Tillie's Room was in the main house and was amazing.  The details made this more of a B&B instead of a hostel and actually the hostel bunkhouse was across the yard.  We asked about bread and smoothies and were surprised to each be given a loaf of freshly baked bread and a large chunk of cheese.  It was delicious and was quickly followed by strawberry smoothies in quart mason jars.  I didn't need or want anything else for dinner and still have enough bread and cheese to make another meal.  We sat on the front porch in vintage rockers and played with the dogs while we ate and talked with other hikers.  This is a wonderful relaxing oasis.
From Ginger:
Nathan's keeping me going these days, as I succumb to foot pain long--familiar to him. It's nothing as bad as plantar fasciitis, but I'm finding the days more challenging, sometimes mentally, sometimes physically. Nathan keeps me laughing much of the day, thankfully. And we're often engaged with talk of our surroundings and nature lessons. I'm grateful we can both walk in silence for stretches. It's those stretches that have been a bit more challenging of late, though. We're both glad to be here.
Woods Hole is about a half-mile off the trail, which I didn't include in our mileage count today. I look at that as trail miles. And the Dismal Falls swimming hole was 0.3 miles off the trail, so we did a bit more than noted, and we're feeling that ""bit.""
The hostel/B&B has a long history associated with the AT. Neville, the founders' granddaughter, compiled a notebook that outlines the hostel history and current services. Her grandmother was a knitter, too!","Dismal Falls

Our night at Woods Hole Hostel was luxurious.  We had a private room that had a ceiling fan and a comfortable queen bed.  I was dehydrated from the hike yesterday and had the worst leg cramps I've ever experienced.  The only way I could get relief was to stand and try to push my hips forward.  I didn't sleep much because of cramping and drinking electrolyte fluids all night but I still enjoyed being here.  Ginger slept as usual although her legs and feet are starting to suffer, too.  We need some recovery time.  When we woke it was almost time for breakfast.  This was part of the real treat of this hostel.  Neville led us into the yard and we joined hands in a circle and she started by instructing us to state our trail names and what we were grateful for today.  She was tearful and apologized for that but it was a moving experience for me.  I've been unable to keep from crying whenever I feel strong emotions ever since I returned from overseas in 1991.  It's sometimes embarrassing but it's part of me and I don't generally dwell on it.  I was tearful too and could only point at Ginger and state that she was my source of gratitude.  Everyone participated and some were sincere while others were funny.  It was all good.  We went to the back of the main house and were served a delicious breakfast alfresco.  It was a morning I will recall very fondly for a long time.  After breakfast I used Neville's sewing machine to make some repairs on our toiletries storage bag and Tunnel Rat's shorts and then it was time to pack and leave.  I noticed a couple packing their car and, after discussing it with Ginger, asked them if they could give us a ride to Pearisburg.  We were planning to go there anyway and we were both still hurting a lot from our hike yesterday.  They graciously agreed to shuttle us and actually delivered us right to the door of the hotel where we planned to stay.  I need a couple of days off my feet or I'm not going to be able to walk without a pack, let alone hike.  We checked in, got a really cheap rate for a basic, clean, room and the lady at the desk offered to do our laundry without us even asking.  The Plaza Hotel is near multiple eating establishment, the post office, a grocery store, and within reasonable walking distance of Wal-Mart and the library.  We had everything we were looking for easily at hand and the weather report for the next 2 days indicated an 80% chance of rain.  I'm not going back in the woods in the rain with cramped legs.  I'm resting and eating while I stay dry and clean.  We spent the afternoon napping, reading, and playing games on our Kindles.  Ginger discovered a Scrabble game that she's playing a lot on her Kindle.  It's fun to see her beat a computer consistently at Scrabble instead of me being her usual victim.  I do win once in a while but she really enjoys this game a lot and it's more like too much thinking for me.  Not really relaxing.  We had dinner at a Mexican restaurant recommended by other hikers and it was really good.  I'm stuffed with fajitas and sweet tea and ready for a really good night's sleep.
An aside from the day:  We were around a married couple who were in the final stages of deciding to divorce.  They weren't really very subtle about their unhappiness and it tended to make the atmosphere tense and uncomfortable for everyone near them.  It made Ginger and I both sad and thoughtful about the choices we all make every day.  I know I wake up every day with the conscious choice to be happy in my marriage and to love and cherish my wife.  I'm not perfect and neither is she but we are as close to perfect together as I could possibly imagine.  I'm blessed.","Woods Hole Hostel

Fatboy & Ginger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568620,"From Fatboy:Oh my!  What a glorious day.  Ginger walked to the gas station before I was awake and brought me coffee in bed.  Does life get any better than this?  
We enjoyed talking about our adventure and reflecting on how interesting this trip has been.  We had breakfast at Hardees.  I can't recall the last time I'd been to this restaurant but I certainly enjoy it now.  There are menu items called ""Aporkalypse"" which have insane calorie contents.  I had a biscuit combo with over 1000 calories and it was delicious.  I know I won't be able to continue eating like this once this hike is complete but I'm enjoying the free pass right now.  I've lost about 10% of my body mass and, other than torn up knees and feet, feel pretty good.  We spent the rest of the day resting.  I took a nap, read and played games on my Kindle.  We went to a Mexican restaurant last night (at Neville's recommendation) located right across the street from our hotel and enjoyed a taste of home.  Usually I avoid Mexican restaurants when we travel because they are generally not up to the standards of the places we go in Texas.  This Virginia version of Mexican food was very good and compares favorably to the real deal from home.  We watched TV and generally stayed off our feet.  It was a great zero-mile day.From Ginger:We're staying at the Plaza Motel, where Linda is taking great care of us. This place was recommended by Cash Back, and he is here for his second visit. The room is basic and very clean. Laundry services were provided free! There's no refrigerator or microwave, but we're OK without them. We're writing postcards in between our other activities. Tomorrow we'll check out another public library. Look out any window or from any direction as you walk outside, and the landscape here is beautiful. We've walked hundreds of miles and I can't get over these mountain views. I'm knitting a cosy for our cookset so Nathan doesn't have to give up his fleece every morning. My pack weight is down so much that I don't mind the extra items. One of these days we need to detail all the things we're carrying. We've tweaked it, of course, since the colder months, but it will be interesting to review them sometime in the future. It's hard to believe how little we need to use out here. ","Pearisburg, VA
