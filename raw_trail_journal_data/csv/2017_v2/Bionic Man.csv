Doesn't seem practical on the trail. Guess we'll find out with this entry. Training going well in the Michigan ice and snow. Lots of outdoors treks. Indoor treadmill sessions on the treadmill on an incline at the local Y. Gear list coming together. Next is food plannning. Love this stuff! Can't wait to be out there!,,View Entry,"Jan 19, Thu",0

Attended an REI sponsored National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) class in Ann Arbor, MI. on Wilderness First Aid. Very professionally delivered, lots of outdoor scenarios in the Michigan cold and snow. Great hands on and classroom. Hope I don't have to use the skills but feel more at ease if I do.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555967,"Flew out of Grand Rapids yesterday to Atlanta. A very kind Navy Buddy and his wife are putting me up and getting me to the Trail tomorrow. Already had ""Trail Magic"" on the way down. After hearing my upcoming Big Adventure story, I had three people offer to pray for me for the next six months. I was touched.! My stay here in Atlanta has been filled with hospitality, camaraderie and lots of Navy stories. Great transition into the hike. I'm getting there! Tomorrow is the day. Excited, a little apprehensive but feeling very positive! It's OK to have butterflies in the stomach, just got to get them all flying in the same direction! ?? ??",,Getting There!,"Mar 09, Thu",0

After hiking up to the start point, Mile 0.0 it was finally, after 25 years of dreaming and planning, finally Go Time! So with a shiver of excitement, I stepped off into my Big Adventure at 11:30am. Very picture perfect day in the high 50s and sunny. Saw wild rhododendrons along the way but trees still bare even down here in the South. The hills were challenging but my training allowed quick recovery at the top of each.Stopped at a very nice campground complete with bear box, privy and an Appalachian Trail Conservancy ""Ridge Runner"" who is paid to take care of the place and enforce Leave no Trace. Dinner of spaghetti and hot chocolate went down well. Breeze and chill into upper30s drove me to hunker down in tent by6:30pm. Enjoyed a audiobook. Lights out at 8:30pm (hikers midnight). Day One a success!","Springer Mountain

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556278,"Started the chilly day with some hot coffee (Starbucks Via) and hot oatmeal. Good for a morning in low 30s. First day of pack up, so took longer than I wanted but I'm sure it'll get quicker. Lots of ups and downs on the trail today. Huff and puff up, quad burn going down. But bionic knees performing flawlessly. Tired at end of day but able to revive overnight. Stopped for a break at Mile 13. I experienced absolute, profound, beautiful silence-no airplanes, cars, wind, water, humans, birds or animals. It was divine! Have not run into many hikers yet. Like I had the AT to myself. Sweet! Rolled into the Shelter site at 3:40pm. Decided to tent. Set up, changed into camp shoes. Had my customary cocktail hour-Powdered Gatorade G2 for rehydration . A Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken pouch dinner was excellent! The hot chocolate topped it off. Another chilly evening so into tent at 6 to listen to audiobook (The Magnolia Story- Chip/Joanna Gaines). Changed clock to DST. Day Two- another good day.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556279,"Heard rain on tent overnight then something that sounded like snow. Whoa! Sure enough we had an inch overnight. Really pretty. Actually warmer than previous mornings, mid 30s. After pulling food out of bear box decided to have a non cook breakfast of caffeinated Crystal Light, nuts, raisins and a granola bar. Worked well. Easier pack out. Beat everyone out of shelter site and on my way by 8:30 am. Hiked the day through a splendidly beautiful landscape. The snow on the trees and ground was magical. Had fog too which made me glad I had all my layers. Snack and lunch breaks have been infrequent,, I just want to hike. I let my stomach dictate, not the clock. Joyously liberating! Called my wife, Susie, from the top of a mountain to check in before decending into next campsite. Great connection. Also made a cabin reservation for following night at Neels Gap (fortuitous because later found out they were all booked when I arrived). Got into Lance Creek Campground at 3. Met some thru hikers, David (I gave him trail name -Goliath), Ben, Google-able and an inspiring young man who is hiking 22 miles per day (number of daily vet suicides currently) to raise money for Vet suicide awareness. AT in 100 days! In tent at 6 after awesome backpacker meal and hot chocolate. Tonight's entertainment-podcasts. I learned something! :-)","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Pack out getting better. Beat everyone out of campsite. They, however, pass me during the day me being the slow and steady hiker that I am. I did get a look back at Springer Mountain as shown in the picture background (tall peak) 24 miles away. Had a breezy, chilly day with lots of ups and downs. Took it as it came and made it into Neels Gap by 2pm. Heard the hostel was booked as well as the Blood Mtn Cabins where I'm staying. Nice to have a bed tonight. Got laundry done while I had a bowl of chili and a pizza and LOTS of Gatorade, Met a couple of thru hikers spending a couple of days here. Washing out all gear and drying things out. Oh and the shower and shave felt fantastic!! Since main store is closed now journaling on outside deck near wifi. Day 4 went well but nice to be inside tonight.","Lance Creek Campground

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556689,"As I relaxed in my warm cabin and heard the rain pelting against the window all night I had my moment of gut check. Looked outside in morning to see snow. Better than a freezing rain! Since lodge didn't open until 8 and didn't serve breakfast I had cold pizza, granola bar and a Via coffee in room. When lodge opened, I made hotel reservation for 3 days down line in Hiawassee, GA. Met Second Chance and Back Again, a couple from Luxembourg who had to stop AT last year and are back trying again. Sent first box order to wife for food to be sent to hotel in three days and off I went. Had my first brush with a Trail Angel. Cathy offered to drive me back to trailhead. Nice lady. Off I went through the only covered portion of the AT at the hostel in Neel Gap, the portal into Day 5. Hiked in 20s, wind chill in teens. However with lighter pack, and getting in shape, it felt good. Passed through one place with no wind and ice and snow on trees. I felt God's beauty and serenity. It felt like He had me in the palm of His hand.Very emotional! Had to shut that down, tears were freezing to my face! Into Shelter area at 4pm and set up tent. In cooking a great lasagna dinner , ran out of gas. Oops! Guess it's non-cook until next resupply. Temp headed down but hunkered down in tent for audiobook and bedtime. Longest hike day so far. Despite extreme conditions, it went well.","Neel Gap

Since no gas had my backup caffeine-caffeinated Crystal Light plus usual assortment of nuts, dried fruit and bars. Have perfected art of getting all tent tidied up, backpack packed and then emerging into cold to take down tent and be on my way by 8:20am. Things move slower in the cold. Cold but clear and sunny during day.My clothing system-shoes, wool socks, low gaiters, merino base long johns, convertible pants, merino base top, fleece, wind/rain jacket with hood, knit hat, gloves. I sweat on ups and cool a bit on downs. Seems to be working except fingertips-cold! Encountered my first Trail Magic. Was 10 miles into my day at Unicoi Gap. Will Webb had set up in the parking lot with chairs, burgers and soft drinks. Bless his heart! Came at a perfect time. Finished the remaining 3miles in the day(longest hiking day so far). In pumping water found out my filter froze. Plan B-Aquamira drops. Met two Brits at tent site (named for a now long gone cheese factory-no remnants). Tea Bag and Big Style. Dropping into low teens overnight so hunkering down. Great sleeping bag helped me through the night.","Low Gap Shelter

Not a lot of sleep in the cold and howling winds . But up at 6 and on way by 8. The Brit boys were still in their tents when I left. Hiked for 5 hours and didn't see another hiker. The AT to myself! Lots of ups and downs today. Like a full day at the gym. Body doing well. Had a second toe left foot ache that I later found to be a blood blister ( treated it later in the evening), Knees doing very well. Some quads and calves aches but surprising myself so far with capacity for hiking long back to back days. Got to Dick's Creek Gap and paid a shuttle to get me 11 miles into Hiawassee and the Holiday Inn Express. Had earlier decided to hike harder, get here earlier and stay two nights. Nice place. Shaved, showered and headed to a nearby buffet. $17, Incl tip. I ate a LOT! Now to a nice night in a bed. Ahhhh!","Cheese Factory Tentsite

Nice night in a bed, and great to enjoy a free breakfast here at the Holiday Inn Express and lots of hot coffee. Today was laundry, gear airing and cleaning., some food resupply shopping to augment the box my wife sent. Who knew that ironing boards make great airing racks for tents? Also found an outfitter with a new glove system. Light wicking inner liner and a Polartec outer layer. She said she just got them in today! Thanks everyone for your prayers. They're working. My old gloves: bye-bye! Average little town but surrounded by lots of scenic hills. Watched Michigan win first March Madness game, Go Blue! The room had a jacuzzi tub. That was a nice afternoon treat! FaceTimed with Navy son and family (wife and 2 grandsons) all decked out in St Patty Day gear! Love technology!! All set for tomorrow takeoff back to trail with a shuttle to pick me up at 7:30am and get me the 11 miles to the trailhead. It's been a wonderful recharge day.","Dick's Creek Gap

Explained that Hiawassee is in a dry county but they were ""three funerals away from changing that"". Old politicos, I guess. On trail at 8 and had it to myself for 3 hrs. Started to rain but with new gloves and my boonie hat, no prob. Mid-morning reflections(when alone and have most energy): 1. Interesting how life's experiences change your perspective-was worried about rain on the trail but after the recent cold I thought the rain was just fine. 2. 90% of life is just getting going and showing up. I had doubts about feet, pack too heavy, can I still go it? It went fine, just need to get out there! 3. Don't worry about things that haven't happened. Most times they don't. Learned that a thousand times out here so far. Crossed NC/GA border mid-afternoon. No walls at border, got over easy! :-) Got into Shelter area at 4:20pm. Nice young man, Candles(birthday on AT start date) sat down and chatted during my crime brûlée dessert. His case, AT is what you do for now after a degree in Philosophy. To bed a little worried about stiff and blistered feet. Guess we'll see what the morning brings.","Dick's Creek Gap (Hiawassee, GA)

On way by 8. Had trail to myself again. The young folks like to sleep in. They give me the trail to myself in the morning and then come racing by late morning. That'll work for me! :-) . Oh and my feet. They are weakest link so far but with moleskin attention, are toughening up and also less stiff after overnight rest. Slowly whipping them into shape. Tolerable. Best hiking yet, up to 60, no clouds, no wind. Tough 3mile climb to 5,435', highest yet. Called for a lunch break. During day met Sherpa (his favorite clothing gear), Crocs(hiking to ME in crocs!!), and Bear Bait( her honey pack exploded in her food sack). Got into Shelter area for tenting at 4:20pm. After a great backpacker chilimac dinner settled in for audiobook and settling down. Young folks had a fire going. So fun to hear the laughter and their talk about all you can eat Chinese buffet in next town. Foot check-very encouraging. Great day!","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557105,"A bit of a chilly, restless night. Can't wait for a little warmer overnights. After another warm breakfast of coffee and oatmeal. (BTW, didn't really run out of gas awhile ago. Discovered my igniter crapped out so use my bic lighter and it works.). Got away at 7:45am. No one stirring in the other 20 tents nor 7 folks in the shelter. Very warm early so stripped down to long sleeve wool top and no hat. Just right. Today's emotional mid-morning reflection: Thank you, Bob, my former boss and now one of my best friends, for the opportunity and mentoring for a successful second career after military service. Because of you I have the wherewithal to do the kinds of things I'm doing now. I luv ya, Bro! (Common expression among the twenty-somethings out here). Had one intense up before the fire tower. 45 degree vertical-lots of sweat in the 68 degree day. Got to fire tower , pics and then moved on. The young folks were stopped for lunch but I got my second wind and blazed a 3mph pace for and hour or so. Mid afternoon I passed the 100 mile mark, another great milestone! Yup and there they came passing. After a long afternon made it to my destination and was immediately met by Trail Angel, David Watters, who took me into Franklin, NC where I had hotel reservations.

Fell into my zero day ritual of laundry, gear clean/air, food resupply trip to nearby grocery, journaling and email catch-up. Very relaxing. Nice day in the 70s but thunderstorm rolling in tonight. Good to be in a room. I first thought I'd picked wrong lodging location on outskirts of town but it worked out. Resupply and restaurants nearby. Went to nearby Willy's BBQ tonight. Great brisket. Info : I was asked about my water system. The pic shows my Platypus(2liter) that fits inside pack with drink tube. The other bottles are useful in camp for cooking water and the smaller for flavored drinks in order not to taint the other containers. I was carrying all filled all day but decided it was not necessary. Regular water sources available along the trail where I filter. The 2 liters weighs 4.4 lbs so I try to limit it to that underway. I've also decided not to look like the other Taliban-looking hikers with beards :-) so I've been shaving every town visit. Ready for a 11 mile day tomorrow.

(the same guy who picked me up two days earlier). He picked me, and another couple of thru-hikers, at the Comfort Inn. This guy does this for free! He's a WWII Army-Air Corps P-38 pilot who flew in and around D-Day! In his 90s and does this shuttling to/from trail and in/around town for food/supplies as a way to give back. Reminds me of my 93yo mother-in-law, Nancy. Inspiring! Every day has a purpose! On trail at 7:55am, great weather. Ended up stripping off layers as day went on. Had trail to self most of day.Got into shelter area for tenting at 3:20pm. Found a sweet tent spot and did the water filtering and dinner thing. Found out that the throw sack I used for getting bear bag line over a tree still had a weighting rock from several days ago that I had been carrying around. Been using provided bear cables since and didn't notice. D'Oh! Pls don't tell anyone out here.

It WILL be a good day. Again had the morning trail to myself. Had a chance to reflect on another pivotal person in my life to get me to this Great Adventure. Thank you to my great friend, Rodney. He started a Boy Scout troop in the mid 90s for his boy, my boys and many others, many of whom made it to Eagle rank. He based the new troop on the Spirit of Good Scouting, He always, based on extensive research and safety/risk analysis, pushed us to new limits. Snow caving, ice climbing, backpacking, canoeing the Betsie River from source to Lake Michigan, winter canoeing the Au Sable until we hit solid ice and had to, Lewis and Clark-like, drag our canoes back upstream to a pull out point. Have used a lot of that training here. I luv ya, Bro! (there's that term again! :-) ) Tough stretch of hiking. Lots of burned out areas from last Fall's fires. Even damage to trail treadway. After 10 hrs on trail made it into shelter area at 6pm. Long, good day! Yummy spaghetti for dinner and into tent by 8pm-dark. Warmest night yet so could skip layers when sleeping.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557660,"Got up and did my usual prep to get out of tent. Started with putting in contacts. Yeah, I know why not glasses? Well, I've been wearing contacts since 1973 and they are what I'm comfortable with. When getting out of tent I noticed a contact lying on tent floor. Oops, guess I didn't get 'er done correctly! The power of prayer- thanks, helps cover for my lack of rigor! I put it in and vowed to be more careful. After a couple of hot coffees (love Starbucks Via) and oatmeals, I was off at 8, first out of campsite. I called, from one of the mountaintops with good cell signal, into the manufacturer, an igniter problem with Jetboil stove and had them ship a new unit to MI when I get back for a bit in Apr. Met new hikers- AT-a-Boy (AT=Appl Trail), Lowtech(Refugee from hi tech industry-in 40s, hmmm), Bozman(A bow hunter), Smokie (loves the Smokie Mtns). Longest day yet, 10hr 40 min. Got to Stecoah Gap and found a side trail with water, flat spot and a place to hang a bear bag, only requirements for a great night and it was.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557665,"Slept well. Nice warm night so could sleep with minimal layers. Out of tent, took down bear bag and treated myself to a head wash and shampoo. Really refreshing. Had a hot coffee and hot oatmeal breakfast and on way by 7:45am. Had a day of solitude, passed only 6 hikers all day. Two familiar faces were Low Tech and AT-a-Boy. Hiked stripped down most of day in short sleeve wool top and no hat (too hot) since it was in the upper 60s. What a contrast to a couple of days ago! Put sunscreen on arms, neck, face and scalp. Found out later it worked, no sunburn! Filled up on water in mid afternoon for last ascent and then long descent into Fontana Dam. Saw dam but then it took another 3 hrs to get down there, an exercise in patience. Finally down to destination at 5:40pm. Got a ride from another trail angel, Mustard Seed, a 2016 thru hiker who is a local fishing guide. Checked into the beautiful Fontana Lodge in the Fontana Village resort. After a quick shave and shower was off to the Lodge's restaurant for a steak and salad. What goes with that? A beer - Dam Beer brewed in Asheville, NC. It was a damn good beer after no alcohol for 16 days! Flopped into a nice soft bed. Great to be here! 164 miles in 16 days. Been a fun/challenging adventure so far.","Stecoah Gap

Other times I'd have a take home box. Not here! Had the usual zero day of finding resupply (food), laundry, a little lunch, journaling, etc. Really a nice resort. The lobby, as you can see, is quite welcoming and cozy. Lots of hikers hanging out here since it's where cell signal is best. Rooms are nice as well. Slow now in off season but lots of cabins, pools, play areas. Also caters to weddings and gatherings. In middle of moving about I lost my phone cord. Argghh! So unlike me. The store (another trip down the hill!) had a replacement. Actually worked out well. New cord lighter and can charge my backup battery and phone at same time. Flex check! Shirt sleeve weather, sprinkling of rain on and off but generally sunny.Ran into Crocs. He is now Sky, since crocs didn't fit properly and so abandoned that idea.Ran into the Brit Boys (Tea Bag and Big Style)in the lodge. Said that cold morning I left them they had to boil water to get stakes out of frozen ground.Left shin is a bit tight, so I used afternoon to ice that and my knees. Ahhh!

Wanted to slam doors and turn up TV in morning. But ... didn't go there. Was showered and ready before restaurant opened so sat in that beautiful lobby and had free coffee. Had internet so read GR Press and emails. What a magical half hour! In restaurant when open to have Hungry Hiker special-2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes, a biscuit, a hash brown patty with dipping ketchup and a big pile of scrambled eggs. Ready for day! The hiker I ate with called city food- weak food. I guess implying backpacking food is - tough food. I like it all! Saw the Fontana Dam -a civil engineering beauty built in 3 yrs. Dropped off permit and was now in Smoky Mtn Natl Park. Sensations- 1. New load of food, heavier, also getting in groove after city. A tough start. 2. Hiking by self with birds singing felt like I was in own personal arboretum . 3. Sweating and struggling up hills and then breeze. Wonder if it's like life where we struggle up and down inclines and declines and then a cool breeze so pure and indescribable washes over us and calls us Hone. I wonder... I was called Home several times today but didn't go. :-) Later in hike, just like book and movie (Walk in the Woods), I had my first hanger-on. Island Poet-missing teeth, needed a haircut, chatty. Said he worked on Mackinac Island in summer scooping horse poo on main drag in return for food.Guess he wiles away off time on AT. Finally told him I didn't talk much and needed my space.

Turns out friends gave him that name as a send off with a t-shirt with that name and a list on back of all the US schools he'lll visit along AT. He's a Brit school teacher on sabbatical. Neat idea! Day was pretty foggy, looked like Jurassic Park. Expected a Velociraptor to come bounding out of the woods at any moment. The knees and left shin didn't like declines too much today. Hate that! Got into Shelter area with about 20 young hikers gathered around fire pit. I tented away from Shelter. Lots of laughter, biggest crown at Shelter yet, 30+. Today's reflection: How grateful I am for my smart, beautiful wife, Susie. She is a fiesty woman but that has kept me on my toes and has made our solid, 41 yr marriage what it is.

Decided that rather than react, I'd respond. Took Motrin last night, did stretching. Decided to wrap that left shin area with a self adhesive gauze from first aid kit and off I went at 8am. Felt better after I was underway. Passed by a bunch of fast young hikers, Tea Bag, Big Style, Wild Thing, Feather and a new guy, Tiger Wiods. Apparently his real life initials are TW, and he is good at disc golf. Nope, he's Caucasian (actually have seen no persons of color on the trail yet). Later saw a good looking young man who, I told him, made me homesick. He had red hair and was sporting a beautiful red beard. Told him it reminded me of my son. Derek, a good looking young man with a red beard. Beautiful day. Took my time and with my sore shin made it a short 7.4 mile day. Got in early and could rest, stretch, elevate. Also had an opportunity to get a place in the Shelter, first time all trip. Got a great spot along wall( only a body on one side that way). Took an early dinner (backpacker beef stroganoff with noodles), then settled into sleeping bag to listen to audio book. Turns out my Shelter neighbor was Papa Choo Choo. He's thru hiking with his wife, Elsa (like in movie Frozen-this lady got so frost bitten in recent cold her fingers tips turned black) and 8th grade granddaughter- home schooled, Spring Dancer (she dances down to springs to fetch all their water). Papa Choo Choo not only puffs up hills but also snores, hence his trail name Thank goodness for earplugs. Sleeping by 9:00pm as was everyone else.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Told wife, Susie later on phone, we'll come back some day. Clingmans Dome named after a Civil War general who explored this area in the 1800s. It is highest point on AT at 6,667'. Stopped for a lunch break mid day and then into destination of Newfound Gap at 3:10pm. Lots of tourists since this is Smokiy Mountain Park and lots of families on spring break. Took 45 minutes but finally hitched a ride (first time I have ever hitchhiked in my life!) with a family from Chicago, Great Midwestern friendliness from Joe (!) and his wife and high school sr son. They dropped me off at Quality Inn in mid town. Shaved and showered and went next door for some ribs and beer. Fresh veggies good too! Amazingly saw Papa Choo Choo and fam and two more of their friends Huckleberry (husband) and Finn (wife). Moved over to their table with my dessert (warm blueberry cobbler with ice cream) and shared stories. Fun! Off to a soft bed. About 207 miles in 21 days. Step by step!","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Also got an exercise ball for feet and shin upon suggestion of a GR massage therapist, Terri. Thx' My trip to Walgreens also included support socks. We'll see if that adds to comfort level out there. A liberating side trip to post office allowed me to ship home gear I haven't used. While waiting for trolley to bring me back into city after post office and food stop, I met a nice young man, Josh.

Off by the usual 8am and was quickly at north boundary of Smokie Mtn National Park. Pls allow me to rant: The allure of Smokie Mtn Natk Park eluded me. Yes it has more conifers than previous parts of AT but ... a $20 permit fee just to walk through, you have to get out in 8 days, you have to stay in shelters(many of which have no privies unlike all previous parts of AT), many tree downs across trail(more than in all previous AT).

I practically ran for 10 minutes across the bald. I was the tallest thing up there!! Oh, sweet Jesus, the tree line. I made it in to the treeline just as a crack of lightning lit up the sky.

Later experienced Maxx Patch, a mountaintop cleared off and never reforested. 4,629' elevation and what a view. For many AT thruhikers, one of best experiences on trail. I enjoyed it, even the strong winds - they cooled me off. Along next part of Trail slipped on mud and landed on left shoulder. Oooh, that!s gonna hurt. It did! Stopped at next steam, filtered water and took some ibuprofen. It helped. Got into Shelter area at 3:50pm. Really had no breaks in day , just grabbed energy bars from my waistband pockets and kept going, Small Shelter So no room, OK with me.

They knew we'd be early (original time was 2:30pm) so they were early. So like that Navy Buddy, Mike, and his wife, Dee. So great to see them. They were kind enough to meet us (on their way to a son's home in PA) and take Cooter to the airport for his departure back to MI. Timing worked great to make his flight. Really going to miss his company. He was a great hiking buddy and a joy to get to know better. A special week! Then it was off to hotel in Johnson City, TN with Mike and Dee. I did a shower, laundry and then we went out for resupply at local grocery and a dinner out to celebrate Dee's birthday. Fun night of BBQ and then a beer in town at the Johnson City Brewing Company. Sat outside on a very pleasant evening. Really a splendid day of friends and camaraderie.","Tentsite

Yuck! Never knew I had that condition! He bandaged and a week later cut the tendon on bottom of toe to straighten it out. This allows calloused bottom of toe to properly contact shoe bottom. A subsequent follow-up showed that ulcer was healing nicely, toe straightened and I'm cleared for a June 15th restart. Also addressing sore left shoulder (a leftover from Apr 4th fall) with an ortho visit and now physical therapy. Think I can lick that as well. Cautious optimism!

Most runners done so they shared electrolyte, water and a banana. That and soon after meeting a nice young famy with three kids on an outing brought my spirits up. One of the young boys talked about seeing a snake and a deer. I praised them for family time getting their kids out in nature. They were curious about, and complimentary of, my hike. Better breezier afternoon with downgrades. However, got drenched the last half hr of day and had to wait out downpour to set up. It did and then the nearby creek called. Decided to strip down (nobody in campsite) and wash clothes and body. Nice! Put clothes back on wet and cooked dinner. Into tent by  6:45pm and changed into dry clothes. What a day!","Campsite

Nice soft treadway but lots of exposed hills. The Good News/Bad News , Part 2! Sunny, hot rest of day. Towards end of day was treated to a curious set of cairns along ridge . Apparently put there by early farmers. Some piles, some neat stacks. I think they were clearing land and ridding it of rocks. Got to shelter area, oh boy. Long 0.4 mi hike down. Nice site though . There with only one other hiker, Red (had red hair from Germany) who was in Shelter overnight. I tented. Chatty but fun to talk with. Warm and breezy so dried out all stuff, finally! Tough water source in thicket. Got enough water but ended up with flea or chigger bites- lots of ankle speckles!

Found out she walks in flip flops because her shoes gave out and her budget doesn't allow for new shoes. But can she hike fast, Wow!

In the afternoon at the top of the big Up was high point for me, literally and figuratively. The Audie Murphy Memorial. Most highly decorated serviceman in WWII. He died near that point in a plane crash in the mountains. Lots of memorabilia left. The term hero is overused these days. He, however, was a real American hero.

Had to scramble back up and had a few choice four letter words for the trail folks and their markings! More almost-technical climbing with iron embedded handholds on rock faces. Yikes!

I shaved, showered (felt great after 6 days).  Hung out chatting with other hikers there, all but one younger.  Bummed beers from Nugget until I could pay him back after a later shuttle run to country store. Got on a later shuttle run for burger-big one, fries, beers and snacks. Commandeered a single bed in the corner. Fans in room kept it pleasant. Place not real clean but functional and what I needed at this point. Hand washed a few things and. with sun, had them dry by nightfall. Lights out at 11. Figuring out tomorrow's plan.

Ate my breakfast purchased previous evening at convenience store and got organized and ready to hike. Overnight came up with a plan. I talked with proprietor, Joe, and asked him to shuttle me up the line to a side trail, the Andy Layne Trail, a 3 miler leading to the AT. He dropped me off at 9:30am and I was in my way. For those extra miles in between I've decided that I'll borrow from my ""bank"" of extra, off trail, wrong turn hiking miles. During day some fun parts, like dangling my feet over the edge of a 1,000' dropoff at The Ledges. Some challenging parts of ridge runnning in the warm sun. A few great views of of Roanoke and Carvin Cove Reservoir.  Could hear city and traffic noises for miles. Finally got into town and hiked along a busy road, through a highway construction zone and up hill to Holiday Inn Express. Walked through front door at 6pm really tired. A very nice place. Shaved and showered and went to closest place to eat- a Crackerbarrel. Great food and service. Finally cooled down in the middle of dinner. 8.5 hr day. Toes did well-moleskin working.

Worked very well. Also caught up on blog. Thanks to those who called my wife worried about no entries. Caught those up throughout the day. Also did a mile walk to shop for snacks, beer, trail food for next couple of days and a Subway lunch to go. Good to stretch the legs. Got all I  needed at Dollar General and a few gas station convenience stores nearby. Dinner was back to Crackerbarrel. Great special-foil wrapped chicken, veggies and potatoes. Like a Boy Scout foil meal. Yum! Great service too from server named Pam, a twice marathoner and very interested in AT stories.

Got to our cozy, well equipped cottage with access to the beach in Hyannis Port that evening. A nice week in residence and a great place to spend my 66th birthday. Ferry out to Nantucket Island for a day long bike ride, a day at Kennedy Museum in Hyannis Port, beach time and always a lot of lobster. A memorable week with our Swiss friends. Food, fun, rest, memories. Then back to Boston and a flight to Va Beach after saying goodbye to my co-hikers. A week in Va Beach with grandsons! Who could ask for more? Quite a fast pace but oh so good! Grandkids are grand! Didn't walk much to continue my feet rest. Then back to Grand Rapids after the latest month away. Nice to be in my own bed. Next up are my doctors appointments for feet and shoulder consults. My next epilogue post will update on those. Thanks for your support, readership and prayers.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574219,"A visit to my podiatrist, including X-rays of both feet, yielded the folowing diagnoses. Acute tendonitis in both feet (at fifth metatarsals-outer edges). Can be cured with rest. In fact, swelling and pain already down after several weeks off the Trail. Doc also built up the outer edges of my insoles to direct pressure/ weight away from outer edges. He also suggested hiking footwear with a stiffer sole. Two toes on my left foot have also developed the hammer toe condition with occasional pain in both. Going back in a couple of weeks to release the tendon in both of those.  Seemed to work well on a previous toe. My visit to my ortho doc re: pain in left shoulder, incl reading a previous MRI, yielded following diagnosis. I have an extensive tear in my rotator cuff, the group of muscles and tendons holding my shoulder joint together. Said tear was likely there long before my Trail fall (I didn't notice it!). Results in a loss of range of motion in arm and a dull ache, especially when I sleep on it. Says it's non-repairable except with a joint replacement. Will try cortisone shots and physical therapy but likely will honor mid-Nov surgery date. Bionic Man adds another bionic joint! :-) Winter time good for recovery while I'm in that typical downtime. Right now getting fired up to go back to trail in 2018. Likely will only do a part of it then and finish in following 1-2 years. Onward!

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575902,"I promised I'd share a few takeaways from my Trail Experience this season. Have they changed my life? I believe so, in subtle ways. A good day is one in which you learn something new about the world or about yourself. Here they are:
Flexibility-Make a plan and adjust as you go. Try new things. 
Positivity-expect that things will work out for the good. Relentless positivity is essential in life! 
Patience-waiting for things and people, accomplishing big tasks in small pieces
People-Enjoying, appreciating, finding the good in people and don't judge by their ""cover'
Humility- Admitting to limitations, Others will be faster 
Challenge- is good, appreciate the struggle for expanding tolerance limits of hot, cold, wet, fatigue
Body - Take care of your body. It's only one you got. Listen to it. Unsolicited comments said I belie my age by 10-15 years
Spiritual journey-believe in guardian angels and the power of prayer. A couple of my face plants on the rocks should have been more disastrous if not for ""intervention""
Awareness-Live in the moment and appreciate and absorb what's around you right now. Listen, look, learn
Reflection- Moments of stillness and quiet are good for reflection on good things in your life.
Simplify - Concentrate on what are the basics you really need on a daily basis in life.
See you next Spring after a Winter of rest, refit and renewal. The goal is to return to the Trail next April 1st . God Bless!","Grand Rapids, Michigan

Scott, was a 2012 thruhiker with trail name “ Possible”  (says with right attitude Anything is  Possible). I had eggs, toast, juice and coffee. The grape juice was actually homemade. He grows the Concord grapes and cans them for juice. Beautiful color and a nice balanced taste. What a treat! After goodbyes was on trail by 8:20am. The first mile or so was like heaven. Beautiful sunny, crisp morning. No wind. Birds were singing. Trail had a slight upgrade and was following a stream. There was a faint hint of woodsmoke in the air. Had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. Got warmer later so layers off, sunscreen and sunglasses on. Met Slow Leak, says name from problem keeping air in mattress and, well, has prostate problems! Also met AT Squared- his initials are AT and he’s hiking the AT. Get it? :-) Got into Shelter area after 9 hrs of hiking. Felt pretty good. Feet holding up well. Found a flat area for tenting and dinner. More good miles today!","Mountain Home Cabbin ( Mile 971.1)

Brother’s trail name is Cropduster. Frequent fragrant flatulance fumigating famously, if you know what I mean! :-o . Did finally encounter Trail Magic midday. A utility box with a variety of things. The Pepsi was oh so good. Carbonation, caffeine and liquid. Thank you Trail Angels! Had rest of day planned. Filter water, go another short distance and tent. Was feeling actually cocky about how good my feet felt and then it happened! I lost my balance on a step up and fell backward downhill. Ouch! Had to extract myself from backpack, restore my orientation and assess. New shoulder a little sore, left calf hit a rock so was tender. Gotta hike on. Limped down Trail a short distance to stream, filtered water and limped to tentsite. Oh Boy!

Miraculously the leg loosened up and worked fine. To be sure I put down additional ibuprofen later in morning. Wow! Good thing because I was hiking the “Rollercoaster”, the part of the Trail with lots of ups and downs and rocks on the trail. Quite tough but the weather was pleasant, sunny, breezy and in the upper 60s. Met Hammers along the way. He’s a Section hiker who, when training for trail, decided to add weight to backpack with hammers, lots of hammers. He added too much weight and sprained his ankle. The unfortunate name stuck.  I finally made it into the AT Center after 10.5 hrs continuous hiking. Pleasant surprises awaited. Lots of nice potable water- no filtering. The hiker cabin was available. No cost, no people (had it to myself). Great way to end day. No tenting (they give you platform beds on which you spread out your mattress and sleeping bag) , nice and quiet inside out of wind and cold.

Think about sun being out- add sunscreen, put on sunglasses, make sure I have cap to protect the scalp. Hot- ensure water going down regularly for hydration. Burning calories- ensure regular snacks going down for nutrition (I’ve been breaking hikes into 2hr segments for snacks, rest, water). Monitor feet, legs, body aches and adjust pack, or gait,  accordingly. Shift pack weight from shoulders to waist or to both evenly. Try to remember to stretch regularly before, during and after hiking. Monitor blazes for any direction change. Step aside for other hikers. Those are the high points.

No more carrying that heavy load.  So I’m going to mail home all the extras -  tent, sleeping bag, etc and use slackpacking bases for the next 100 miles. Nice feeling especially given that I’ve been warned about formidable rock ridges coming up on the Trail. So ... I checked into the Hampton Inn, Pine Grove, PA after a shuttle from Joyce. My new slackpacking base for a couple of days. Found cold beer to go at the diner across the street. Ahh, life is good!","Greenpoint School Rd (Mile 1181.4)

Trees starting to leaf out. Joyce shuttled me to Post Office to ship out the gear I will no longer need due to my slackpacking plan to the end. It was 13.75 lbs of gear. That was a liberating feeling. Oh my, now I won’t have to lug that over the rocks! Also used time to start my research for transportation from Delaware Water Gap to the NY airports.

Was reminded I was in PA dairy farm country. Ah the wafting aroma of manure. All natural! :-)  Met Giddeyup. Had thruhiked in 70s. Now retired in FL and doing AT again in sections. He’s got a new knee, two new shoulders and two repaired achilles. Wow, he’s bionic too! He was slackpacking too. As I was admiring one of the many sweeping views, I captured a hawk in flight (see photo) and heard a distant pack of coyotes howling and barking. A magical moment! A fair amount of rocks on the trail which slowed my pace. Ended up being a 7.5hr day after which Joyce picked me up and gave me a quick tour on way back to hotel. Saw a couple covered bridges; a very large, ornate Hindu country retreat (oddly placed out here in PA);  and downtown Pine Grove. Did a tub soak, laundry and then out to nearby diner. Full multi-course meal with milk shake for under $15!!! I tipped heavy! Also saw a gent eating there with a WW II Vet ball cap on. I walked over and shook his hand.  He said, “Not many of us left!”.

Maybe I could do Dos Equis commercials. “He once hiked 170 miles of the Appalachian Trail without sleeping in a tent or shelter. He is The World’s Most Interesting Man! Stay thirsty, My Friends!” :-) Well it’s true - I will have slackpacked the last 170 miles this year!

Met Peaks,  a young thruhiker from Smokies area in TN near the peaks there. Very steep down at end of day into Pt Clinton, PA. Had called new shuttler/ Filbert B&B owner, Kathy, who was there at same time as me. She took me back to B&B where we discussed shuttle schedule for my stay. She agreed to the pickup points and I then moved jnto room and cleaned up. Kathy was even so kind as to have a friend pick up a case of Yuengling Lager beer. I like this lady already!

Getting along trail nicely, even though rocky, when during a flat spot my boots got tangled in sticks on trail. Down I went but in my downward arc there was a tree that I hit full force with my face. “No, Jesus, No, Jesus, No”, I said not wanting to get knocked off the trail. Blood started dripping from my face like red sweat. I clawed at my backpack for the first aid kit. Put a gauze pad on likely source, started assessing damage (NOLS Wilderness First Aid training kept me calm). Got antiseptic and a bandaid on likely spot then I remembered selfie phone feature and so looked. Also saw a nose divot and bruised lip and chin. Good news: No concussion (hadn’t blacked out since I was yelling at Jesus), no broken nose or orbital bone or neck or jaw or teeth! Took record photos of all, including the tree! Collected and moved on.  Could feel blood oozing from eyebrow wound so stopped and with assistance from passerby hikers put on a gauze and tape bandage. Worked better. Looked worse so I pulled down my cap and pressed on. Eventually got to a flat rock-free trail section and picked up the pace to make up for lost time. Gave advance notice to Kathy and we met at Trailhead at 4:30pm. We both assessed and decided a trip to ER was in order. I cleaned up back at B&B, ate some dinner and she took me to a nice little hospital ER in Palmerton, PA. I was in and out in half hour. Doc decided to superglue my eyebrow back together. Slick!

Knowing rocks were going to increase,  I purposely made this day shorter. All day overcast, in 50s and foggy. No views but great for hiking. For first time I actually passed someone on the AT.

Fields still wet so no weekend farm work for him and instead I got to chat with him up to the trailhead again today. Ran into Iceager at trailhead.  He was very interested in my slackpacking arrangement. Said he'd call Kathy to get details. On way by 8:10. Variety of trail types - rocks on / rocks off.   Then rain started at 10:30 about the time I was encountering Knife Edge. Basically a sheer rock edge that was brutally treacherous, especially in the rain. Sheer terror but luckily I did it with only my light slackpack. Was closely followed by a young woman who announced, “This is not fun”. We both made it. Found out she was a section hiker with trail name, Firecracker. Thought it was because of the cute explosion of freckles across her cheekbones. Nope! She was born on the 4th of July. We high fived, she moved on. A little later was a big up and over a high rock outcropping call Baked Oven Knob. Easy road up, big treacherous rocks going down. Made it and decided to change out my base layer that was soaked and hypothermia was starting to set in. A wool long sleeve base and a fleece did fix the problem. Think rain jacket compromised from many washings.  Yuck! Shorter hiking day - planned that way because I was anticipating the tough parts and so got picked up by Kathy at 3pm.

(No, separate rooms here!) Kathy shuttled me up the mountain and I flew through the first 4.2 miles quickly. Easy terrain and smooth trail. However, I had planned a shorter day because the next 6+ miles were tough. After I hiked over the Lehigh River bridge at Lehigh Gap the Trail went pretty much straight up. For the next hour I was climbing hand over hand straight up and over up Blue Mountain Summit. Tiring but exhiliarating. Sunny warm day so finally I hit rocks in clear weather! I summitted and met southbound thruhiker, trail name Chief Attakullakulla (an influential late 1700s Cherokee Indian leader she admired). Very upbeat mid-40s woman from TN. As I was hiking a little later on other side of the summit looking down on Palmerton, PA (yes, the place they superglued my head back together), a church carillon (in middle of photo) began bursting out hymns that I could distinctly hear up on the mountain. Felt like a mini-reward for having climbed up that crazy summit. Finished up the remaining rocky trail and was at Trailhead by 3pm. Again planned a shorter day knowing about the tough spots. Kathy wasn’t able to shuttle me back to B&B immediately so I used that time at the trailhead to book my transportation back to MI a couple days hence (now that I knew I was going to finish this year’s section on time). Amazing what you can do with a signal, a mobile phone and a credit card! Back at B&B I found Iceager had moved into the B&B and wanted to hike a few days with me. We chatted over dinner there.

Breakfast of scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and toast was fortifying. Since Little Gap close we were on Trail by 7:10am. Hiked and chatted for first two hours then Iceager, a faster hiker, went ahead. Didn't see him rest of day. The weather was nice - sunny, 50s and 60s. Pretty rocky trail today. Actually very boring. Flat, no views, no water features, just endless rocks. Later in day took a side trail for some spring water, just to break up monotony. Cold, pure (after filtering), refreshing! Gave Kathy 1 hr pickup notice at 3:45pm. Just then a major storm moved in. Dark sky told me to get phone, pack and me under wraps. Just in time. Wind bursts, sticks flying, heavy rain hit. Then lightning and thunder. Finally, Trail was not boring! Hiked hard and made it to meeting spot, Wind Gap (yes there was wind!, in time, in pouring rain. Iceager was already there. On way back to B&B Kathy had to drive around downed trees and traffic backups from loss of power to traffic lights. B&B had no power so ... time to improvise. Ordered food delivery from a local place, and broke out a few leftovers to await delivery. Made it in good time (they had power at restaurant) and we moved out onto the porch where there was more light. Sitting there, on the porch, with our great food (my Veal Marsala was the best I’ve ever eaten), we felt like we didn't even mind the power outage. We felt like Big Dogs! I ended my gourmet feast with some Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream. Oh my, who cares about a power outage? The power came back on at 8:45pm as we are prepping for our hiker bedtime hour.

Overcast skies started to rain at 9:30am and really never quit all day. Very boring, rocky  trail again. Then ... it got exciting. I hit Wolf Rocks. Up and over lots of boulders, in the rain. Why not? Then I felt a chill coming on since I was soaked so did the unlayer change out like a couple days previously and felt revived. Pouring rain continued. A little later started feeling hypothermia so hiked harder to warm up. This time on a service road, albeit flooded in spots, that provided an easier trail surface. Then, late in the afternoon,  the downgrade into Delaware Water Gap started. Steep, treacherous path with a water torrent down the middle. Only fell  a couple of times with minor knee scrapes. Lots of out-loud self talk to be careful, don’t slip, focus on foot placement. Tough going, especially 10 hours into my hiking day. At 6pm I finally walked into town to, amazingly, a church carillon playing beautiful music. Morale boost. I was right at the Deer Head Inn, my night’s lodging, but  ... all doors locked and nobody home. What???  Luckily an employee appeared and called owner who was away checking email at library since her internet out due to storm. I sat on porch advancing in hypothermia just as owner appeared. She quickly gave me a room and I hit the shower. Turns out I was able to get Iceager a room in the Inn as well.

Deer Head Inm had two major trees down in backyard, One of homes along Main Street had a huge tree down right on its roof.  Lots of utility line trucks and tree company trucks out on the streets. Great coffee and pastries at the bakery.  Also enjoyed a conversation at breakfast with a bicyclist on long distance ride now in his town stop. Always very interesting stories. Later, after lunch at Sycamore Grille (again!),  I completed last unhiked portion of trail over I-81 bridge over Delaware River. Lots of fast moving traffic and a literal bouncing bridge when large trucks passed. Little scary. Was at trailhead in 35 minutes. Effectively closed the loop to last year’s starting point in NJ. AT mileage changes from year to year. It was 1.5 miles but using shorter distance for math to match up with last year’s stats. It was a Near Zero Day,  A Nero.

Better weather
Ahead of thruhiker bubble – fewer crowds, less resource competing, service providers less burned out
More slackpacking, fewer zero days
No breaks this year – less restart problems but missed home a bit more
Falls – Some last year, one major that tore my left rotator cuff (had shoulder successfully replaced in the off-season), two major this year (no long term damage)
Gentler grades but more rocks
More towns, signal, civilization, fewer dry counties
Same 15 lbs weight loss

Enjoyed journalistic aspect – photos, day story
Enjoyed town people and occasional section hiker (usually older)
Really enjoyed alone time (less sensory assault)

Eeby-Jeeby and Star Lord (thruhikers) had camped there late in the night and were still getting going, Last intense upgrade of the day was in the heat of the afternoon when I was low on water. Got rubbery legs but decided that was from lack of calories. Put down a Snickers bar that gave me a little cotton mouth but did help with energy level. Lots of breaks going up. Amazing nature show on the way up. Heard fluttering about 10’ off side of trail. At first looked like a hawk had entangled its talons in a branch. Instead it had attacked a snake sunning itself on the branch and was holding it down with it’s talons as it pecked at it with its beak. And just like that it flew off with its prey. Wow!

The food was amazing- a perfectly done beef tenderloin, mashed potatoes better than I make them and sautéed spinach that was better than I’ve ever had. A couple of beers and, well, the best birthday dinner you can have alone. But my Navy son actually called during dinner so that phonecall was part of the celebration. (Ironic to have two Navy guys talking on the West Point campus!) A walk down the street to an ice cream shop for dessert and the evening was perfect. It was a great day to take a zero with heat index approaching 100 today.  Recharged and ready to get back out there tomorrow. Onward!","Bear Mountain Inn

First part of today’s hike was over the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Memorial Bridge. A suspension bridge built in 1924. To a civil engineer hiking over a historic bridge early in the morning under clear skies with breezes wafting down the Hudson, this was sheer heaven! Met two GA older section hikers - Pokey Stogey and Sugar Bear. Liked to chat! Lots of very thoughtful birthday wish txts thru day! Passed by a spiritual center at 1pm just as their bells were sending out an interlude. How magical that was drifting through the woods. My birthday treat! Had a chat with Faithful (she) and Renegade (he) . Thruhikers from TX and have been in the trail since Mar from GA. Steady and undaunted by Covid. In fact, they’ve loved having the AT to themselves. All day pretty rocky, lots of ups and downs, pretty warm. Finally at destination. Pitched tent and then saw a hornets nest. Decided I’d try to relocate it. Bad mistake! Got attacked. Ouch!

Made it to the highway at 4:15 then hiked a half mile to a deli that advertised great food and free camping out back. It was perfect. Open grassy area, a hose spigot and great sandwiches and drinks. The Reuben and chips and a couple of chocolate milks were a supper that put a smile on my face. They even had lawn chairs where you could finally sit down on something besides a rock.

A station dedicated solely to the AT! At the end of my hiking day I got picked up by Frank at a little after 2pm and ended up in Kent, CT. On the way in Frank talked about the town, about his hobby of area Native American historical research and a lot of related stuff. Very interesting man. Dropped me off at my lodging (Fife & Drum Inn) for checkin. Nothing spectacular but close to restaurants and shopping conveniences.

Early part of AT went through a guy’s driveway. Odd! He did provide a water spigot for hikers. I thanked him. This part of AT coincides for 100+ miles with the Long Trail (LT). Is said to be the inspiration for the AT which was later conceived in 1921. The LT was also part of the Underground Railroad that slaves hiked to freedom in Canada where it ends. Later in hike came across the 1600 mile mark of the AT. Now a member of the 1600 Mile Club, A little later did cross the MA/VT line. Exciting to be in the 12th AT state (out of 14). Since I was starting with a new shuttler, Charlie,  I planned a short mileage day to allow wiggle room for coordination. Good thing! Things got challenging at the end of the hike and pickup. I stopped, based on my mapping, at what I thought was County Road, the prearranged pickup point. It was actually a high power line service road. Really pickup point was 100 yards up trail. Charlie was busy so he sent another shuttler. The sub shuttler came roaring down the real pickup road. I heard him and raced up to meet him. He didn’t even stop, honk horn or wait. He roared out, the turd! Turns out he’s that kinda guy. Well Charlie ended up making the pickup after all. 4.5 hours after I had finished up my hike. Total exercise in patience.

This next stretch over Glastenbury Mountain has no access points for shuttle pickup. So on the trail then to a shelter area overnight and hike out second day to a shuttle access point. Good to keep up the outdoor skills. Kept weight down by not packing stove (only non cook items and a Subway sandwich for dinner) And no sleep bag, only a silk sleeping sack. Shuttler said 7:30am pickup. Luckily I was ready early because he said he’d be there at 7:10. I didn’t miss a beat and was ready when he showed. He kept my excess gear in trunk for next day hotel checkin. On trail at 8:03am. Uphill at start then a pretty flat day with temps in 70s but a bit humid. Seeing a lot of LT (Long Trail) and local hikers along this stretch. Very uphill at end of day near shelter. Got into shelter area at 3:30. Saw Hailstone and son. Eventually a few other tenters and other hikers using shelter showed up at the site. Had a privy, bear box (to safely store food overnight) and an amazing water source. Mother Nature put a steady source of ice cold water up there in the mountaintop. Of course I filtered it but what a miracle! Started to get chilly so I  ate my sandwich and climbed into my tent by 6. Relax, journal. Good day. It was absolutely quiet up there. A nice change from the room a/c. Was pleased with day and very comfortable being out there “ in the wild”. Farther up the mountaintop was the watch tower which I’ll explore further tomorrow.","VT 9

Got in my silk sack. Curled up in the fetal position and did the best I could at sleep. Did get some. Ate my no cook breakfast in morning. Even packed in a fresh orange to enjoy on the mountaintop. A treat! Packed up and stopped at the watch tower to check out the views. Really could see forever on a crisp,  crystal clear morning. Could see where I’ve been hiking (south) and where I was going to be hiking (north). All beautiful Vermont green mountains. Rest of day a lot of mud, rocks and roots. Tedious and tough on legs. No momentum. Hiked hard all day and was close to the projected time of finishing at 4:30. Finished at 4:22. Waited a half hour for shuttler. Checked into new hotel in Manchester Center, VT. (Hampton Inn). Despite state rules re: Covid quarantining, etc I had no problem checking in since I was coming off the trail . Beautiful new property. A quick cleanup and I was on my way to a close easy,  good review restaurant. Turns out it was perfect. Cold beer, great eats and super service. There was a nearby supermarket (Shaw’s) for a few provisions and then back to the room to sort out and clean my gear.  Tough day but got my outdoor overnight checked off. Got my new base established in Manchester Center. Actually all good! Lots of boxes checked today.","Goddard Shelter

This Hampton really does a nice job at their free breakfast offering despite the Covid restrictions. Hats off! Took a tray and my fruit, rolls, coffee to my room for social distance eating. Quite nice. Was ready for a prearranged shuttle pickup at 6:30am. Actually showed at 7:20. Oh well! On trail at 8:03. 3.8 miles on a steady up to Stratton Mountain and the watch tower. Not a bad climb. The tower views were amazing. Then a face pace for another 3.5 miles down to Stratton Pond. It was lunch time. I had a bench and I had the most amazing setting. The picture almost captures the serenity and beauty I enjoyed. Felt very privileged to be there. The rest of the day was a lot of grinding out the miles. Various levels of trail beds. Some very nice and quick, some rocky, rooty and slow. About when I was worn down I think my Wingman. Bob, put a hiker there along the Trail for me to stop, chat, rest, recharge. It worked. Wonderful young 30-something thruhiker. Mr. President has done the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail and now the AT. He did say the AT is the hardest. He said he got his trail name as he happened upon some girls singing the Marilyn Monroe song Happy Birthday, Mr President sung to JFK. Funny! So I was refreshed and knocked out the rest and was off trail by 6:45. A 10 hr, 45 min , 17.5 mile day in the trail. Whew! The shuttler was late despite our prearrangements but that didn’t take away my ecstasy at having finished my big day. Surprisingly I was not exhausted. Guess I have my trail legs. A quick shave and shower at the hotel and I was off to the same Seasons Restaurant from the previous night to have what I’d been thinking about all hiking day- a rack of bbq ribs and beer. Ta-Da! They provided that with their usual great service. Very productive day! Proud of the accomplishment. About 300 miles down this section and a 100 to go. Onward!","Kelly Stand Road

Ate in room and enjoyed the coffee. Did a morning shave shower and out for a pharmacy run for moleskin and epsom salts for a foot soak. Successful. Also picked up a few lunch things so I wouldn’t have to go out again. Caught up on blogging. Always fun to recount the last several days. Txt’d my shuttler to plan tomorrow’s pickup and hike. He’s on board. Mid afternoon decided that nearby ice cream store would be fun. Mint choc chip in waffle cone as the photo shows. Yum! Stopped and enjoyed warm afternoon sun, and my ice cream, on Hampton’s lovely patio. Soothing! Did manage to find a container to soak feet in salt bath. Thank you, Hampton Housekeeping ladies. Ahhh! Then out to dinner for third night in a row at Seasons Restaurant.  They were very kind and welcoming again! Talked with proprietor. Says he enjoys it and has been doing it for many years.

Lots of fog and cool temps. Wind chill at 53 degrees. 40 degrees diff from several weeks ago. Yikes. The AT actually goes up through one of their ski runs. Hard to imagine a 3’ snow base in a couple of months! Found a warming hut at the top. Had a snack then put on my rain/wind jac and cap. Very foggy at summit as the photo shows. Found my way down and passed several day hikers ( it was Sunday - they come out on weekends). Also passed a day hiker who was a local Vermonter and was a previous AT thruhiker, Moo Shoo. He gave me a couple factoids about VT. Second smallest state population (smallest-Wy). World’s largest granite and marble quarries. Claims their marble is shipped over to Italy for polishing then back to US for sale. Met another thruhiker, Storyteller. He was shirtless. He went over the summit shirtless. Nice young man with a big red beard. Ahh the impetuousness of youth! Charlie and Becca, my shuttlers, showed up just after I was at trailhead. Nice timing. Also carrying two young ladies who just came off trail and were going to stay at Charlie’s hostel. They were Bad Bunny and Zippy. Sisters, SOBO thru hikers. They said they were from everywhere. Their dad is in the Army. Got dropped off in Manchester at my hotel and after cleanup decided on a Thai dinner in town. Spicy duck with stir fry veggies. Yum!

Oh well, was on trail at 7:50 and right into an upgrade. Thing is, with cool temps, I barely break a sweat. Nice hiking! Way up on the ridge I had blue skies above but clouds/ fog below me. Very peaceful. No hikers, no wind, no birds, just quiet. And the rich, alive, wonderful smell of pine trees. Not the dried pine smells I had previously experienced but live pines exuding a luxurious scent.It indeed felt like Christmas. Imagine all the happy memories coursing through me! I smiled a lot. The photo shows pines above and at side of trail.  The photo also shows the boardwalk often placed along the trail. It is as much to protect the sensitive forest floor as it is to keep us hikers out of the mud.   I met a NOBO Section hiker , Quill, who has been at this for 6 years. Says this is her year to finish. She’s a very determined senior hiker like me. You go, Girl! Finished up at 3:30, got shuttled back to the hotel and celebrated a beautiful day with a thin crust pizza and a huge salad takeout from nearby pizzeria. Started working on the next shuttler up the line. Got input from current shuttler, Charlie. Looks like we’re going to work this out, thank you very much. Great scent-filled, uplifting day!

On trail at 6:15am. Temps upper 50s, gentle grades, no sweat (literally! :-) ) . The Vermont trails, as I had mentioned, do a great job routing along flowing water. At times the brooks are gentle and soothing. At times they are rushing and adding excitement and vitality to the air. I couldn’t help but equate the water to the lifeblood of the forest flowing through the brooks and rivers - the arteries. All living things there draw their existence from this precious gift- water. Passed Little Rock Pond. Beautiful setting amidst pine trees. A popular spot but not this morning. Too early. Happened upon a playful cairn garden. Hikers pile up stones in various creative ways. I couldn’t help but think of rocks as Legos for hikers! :-) Since I started early, I was off trail by 11:45 so had all afternoon to relax, tub soak, clean up, catch dinner and get ready for another early morning tomorrow.

Was rewarded with a lunch break spot offering a million dollar view. A pinch me moment- am I really lucky enough to be enjoying this? More hiking along brooks. Last hour of day the rain started. Not predicted but no worries. Put on cap, rain jac, pack cover and phone sleeve. It’s only water. Hiked out at 1:40pm. Charlie and Becca there to take me into my new base- Rutland, VT Hampton Inn. Conveniently located near a couple of restaurants and a supermarket. Restocked drinks and snacks (for evening happy hour - civilzed!!) at store then out to closest eatery.

So had time for this Hampton’s version of its free breakfast in Covid times. The front desk got your order and went into back room to produce it. Pre-packaged egg sandwich for microwave warming in room, bottled juice, coffee, fruit cup. Not to belabor all this food talk but to point out how nimble all the chains are at working in this new pandemic environment. Hats off to them! Shuttler pickup at 7:15. He’s been battling traffic, fog and lots of law enforcement watching speeds. Hiking by 7:45am up to Mt Killington summit. It took 4 hours but there I was at the last 0.2 side spur up. Do I go? Asked other hikers if the vertical climb was worth it? Absolutely. Off I went. Challenging but oh so worth it. My Killington is home to Vermont’s premier mountain ski area. Clear day, infinite views including right down into Rutland where I’m staying. Took time on the way back down to avoid disaster on all the vertical rocks. All good and then back on the AT. Best view for me on the entire AT so far. (Some others might have been better but they always seemed to be fogged in). Up ahead the AT was rerouted to a new alignment. All notes said to go with the old. It’s the same distance as the new alignment. It is now called the Sherburne Trail. I went the old alignment, now a blue blaze trail. It was great and I finished up at US 4 at 3:50pm a few minutes quicker than my projected time. Charlie and Becca there to pick me up and shuttle me back to Rutland. We spent a bit of time in front of the hotel figuring out the upcoming shuttles Charlie is going to provide. It was great to spend a few extra calm moments with them instead of their usual frantic race off to collect another hiker. Good folks! A couple motivating events today.

He was excited not to be shuttling those back roads in his usual sedan. Quick, close-distance shuttle and I was hiking by 8. Hiked through a State Park car camper campground. Saturday. Not many people up yet at 9 am when I went through. Then past Kent Pond (despite the name, it was pretty good size). Simply gorgeous! Had kayakers and stand up paddleboarders enjoying the pond. Met a young man with a bright red beard and an accent. Turns out he was Swiss from Grindelwald, one of the prettiest Swiss Alp towns I’ve visited. Nice chat. Has a VT girlfriend and is hiking for fun until school starts up again. Pretty gentle hiking all day. The incredible new AT thing today was a ladder to help get down one big rock.

Guess he’s covering a lot of hikers. Not a problem. Got out of there before an afternoon rain. Charlie said road was very rough coming to get me. So he was glad he had his new SUV. As we drove back through some really beautiful valleys between the green mountains, Charlie told me all about his ancestors (1800s) owning lots and lots of property. Many cousins live and work in the area to this day. Farming, tree products. Fascinating. While driving, his daughter, Beka, travels with him to take hiker calls and manage schedule as Charlie is driving. Much safer.  :-) It was interesting to hear her wave off other hikers because they had me “under contract” and had to take care of me. We’ve been getting along well. Tried a new dinner plan.

Met several interesting thruhikers today. Red beard (guess why-yup!) . He said he was a GA boy. Very successful career as industrial refrig manager . But as he grew to 300 lbs he and his wife decided on a life style change. Sold everything, bought an RV, left the stress behind and she now supports his thruhiking. He’s much trimmer and happier. Met Cherry. She’s flip-flopppng. Started in middle at Harper’s Ferry. Going north to Mt Katahdan then starts again in middle and goes south. Met an African American young lady - SOBO thruhiker.

A 45 yr old woman NOBO thruhiker who continued through the pandemic because, well, she’s a rebel. They all have a story,They do like my Bionic Man, new joints story as well.

COVID
Hiked during a pandemic. After a Spring / Summer under state at home orders I was so ready to bust out. The AT was shut down initially but mostly reopened by July 15 when I started. It was indeed therapeutic! Other hikers had the same thought and some even ignored the trail moratorium completely. A rugged, rebellious lot these AT hikers are! I practiced masking when off trail in the towns as well as handwashing, distancing and lots of fresh air. I started the trail with a negative Covid test and ended it with a negative test. Locals were very friendly especially when I told them I had been on the trail (essentially I had been quarantining) for awhile. They allowed me, then, into the New England bubble. Most prominently was into the lodging. Although the pandemic added another layer of challenge,  the outcome was successful.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Wed",0
Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631541,"PHYSICAL/ MENTAL 
I trained for several weeks prior to the hike with miles, hills and a weighted backpack. It helped but, truthfully, it took me a week to ten days to really get my trail legs. Tough to replicate AT terrain in flat Michigan. But overall I felt prepared, strong mentally and physically. I did have a few falls and a few scrapes and bruises, all of which I was able to handle with band-aids and tub soaking.  The first 10 days were in a heat wave. Lots of hydration and determination got me through. It bent me but it didn’t break me. Later, cooler weather helped a lot. By the end I had seen a temp range of 50 degrees. 
STRATEGIES
I didn’t want to hike in the dark and I didn’t want to push my knee replacements too hard so I chose to limit each day to 10-13 miles with just a few days outside of this if needed to make plans work. That kept it fun and less work-like. I did, after about 10 days, work into the slackpacking routine. This was key to getting this section complete. Out in the morning with a shuttler, hike all day, then back to my lodging with a shuttler from a pre- arranged trailhead. Carried less weight, slept fewer nights on the ground in varying weather conditions and ate much more exciting food in town. I will look to repeat this strategy for next year’s section.",,View Entry,"Oct 22, Thu",0

Had most of my gear from previous sections. It served me well as in times past. Though I did have a few gear glitches. Didn’t completely clean my Sawyer water filter after last outing. So initially had a constrained output until I could properly backwash in town.  Backpack cover not too waterproof. Holes and old. Not a big deal since I experienced minimal rain. First rainstorm in tent reminded me I should have re-waterproofed. Some drops but luckily not a show stopper. Tent pole shockcords, I found out, were old and stretched. Didn’t snap into place quickly so that added time to setup. Otherwise had all proper gear - thanks to spreadsheets and checklists.

The first 10 days were quite a challenge with heat indexes in the 90s, me not having my trail legs and me carrying a full pack. Ironically, just as I shifted to slackpacking, the temps were more moderate and continued that way. Rain was almost nonexistent- nice! A couple of sprinkley days, a couple of hard rain days (one of which was the Hurricane Isaias aftermath) but that’s all. Overall the terrain wasn’t bad compared to previous parts of the AT. Trail bed, with a few rocky/roots/muddy exceptions, was well maintained and quite nice. There were many beautiful sections of the trail in CT, MA and VT. Pines, green mountains, vistas  and many hidden lakes. Lots of pleasant surprises. With slackpacking goes the shuttler interface. I used the services of 7 shuttlers - Frank, Joe, Pete, Debbie, Dave, Charlie and Joe. All of these folks had unique characters and personalities but added a lot of color to my days. I learned flexibility, patience, gratitude and a lot about their lives, the local environment and the regional history. They certainly enhanced my trail experience!",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Fri",0
Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631573,"AFTERMATHMy last post from the Trail talked about my right foot being swollen and mad at me. Well it was swollen because my second toe was infected. I had treated it over the last several days of the hike sufficiently, I thought, to finish and travel home to MI. Upon my return it was diagnosed as osteomyelitis, commonly referred to as bone infection. I was admitted to the hospital and the medical staff rallied around the problem, pumped me full of antibiotics intravenously and them amputated the top two sections of the toe. The good news is that they stopped the infection from spreading into my foot and, after almost a week in the hospital, I was on my way to a full recovery. Great care, good outcome (minus a bit of one toe) and optimistic about total recovery. No loss of mobility or stability. Could have been a lot worse. Quite an experience! As part of my wind down/recovery I have been cleaning, repairing, replacing and storing gear. Updating my checklists will follow shortly. I’ll be ready for the next section. SUMMARYOther than stubbornness and error in judgement in not treating my toe sooner and properly, this section hike was an uplifting experience. Met lots of great folks, saw a new part of this beautiful country of ours and relieved a part of the Covid stress.ONWARDI’m ready to take on the next, and last, section of my Appalachian Trail experience, 425 miles, next Summer (2021).

Gap Hiking. It’s where you skipped a part of the AT on your thru or section hike due to a variety of circumstances and it bothers your conscience (or at least it does for some of us) so you go back and “hike that gap”. 
Travel opportunities allowed my wife and I to revisit my gap areas in VA, TN and NC. So Day 1 was a 6 miler near Daleville, VA. My faithful shuttler, Homer Witcher, who shuttled me a bunch in 2017 and 2018 shuttled Susie, my wife, and me from the ending parking lot to the start. Really beautiful day, in the lower 30s but light wind. Great day for hiking on the AT, just had to layer up. It was great to have a hiking buddy. A variety of terrain including switchbacks. But we were treated to nice views, especially since the leaves weren’t out yet. Had woods, ridge lines and pastures (complete with grazing cows like a previous Switzerland hiking experience). We only took one energy / water break to take in the views. Otherwise steady enjoyable hiking. Great day with only a slight setback when Susie slipped on leaves and hyperextended a knee. She finished but with a sore knee, a true trooper! We enjoyed a few really quiet spots, not many other hikers and a gorgeous day. Nice first gap hiking day!",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Fri",0

Still part of Trail I skipped on Jun 21, 2017. My wife dropped me off on another gorgeous day - cool but sunny. Since it was a Sat, lots of day hikers. First leg of day was a 4 mile uphill to McAfee’s Knob. My slow steady uphill was rewarded with beautiful views from the Knob. Asked a clean cut young man to take pics. Did a great job and found out he was a Marine Corps Officer candidate starting training in near future. Also chatted with the on-duty Park Ranger, an Army vet who did time in Afghanistan. To go on duty up there he hikes in the 4 mile uphill I had just done. Whew! (and, of course, hikes back down when off duty! Ooh - Rah!) Moved along quickly during the day with minimal water and snack breaks. Another challenging uphill in afternoon to Tinker Cliffs. More great views on a beautiful day and some exhilarating hiking along the sharp cliff drop offs. Felt pretty good all day but did feel my lack of training (was a bit tired) as I finished up the day’s trail gap hiking at Scorched Earth Gap. Unfortunately I then had to hike the 3 mi blue blaze side trail,  Andy Layne Trail, to get to parking lot meeting spot for pickup by my wife. All downhill but an extraordinary number of steps built into the trail. Great weather all day. I was bushed when I finished up at 4:50pm.

This gap hiking was of a short stretch I skipped on June 23, 2017. My wife, Susie, dropped me off after I had gotten straight out of bed, dressed and hit the Trail before coffee and breakfast. Figured I could handle it since it was so short. This part of the Trail is immaculately maintained by the shuttlers, Homer and Theresa Witcher. It was a nice stretch with varied terrain. Unfortunately it runs near I-81 with lots of traffic noise. I did see wildlife, though. A small fawn who, after sizing me up,  ran off into the woods. I texted Susie with a 20 min warning of my finishing up. She drove out from the hotel and, bless her heart, brought me coffee. Really a fantastic start to Easter Sunday.

Set up a shuttle for today’s hike to save Susie the hassle of dropping me off and picking me up. Good choice, lots of narrow switchbacks to get up to the starting point. The nice proprietor of Black Bear Resort, Travis, picked me up from my parked car at Watauga Lake. Travis is retired Navy so we got to tell each other sea stories during the shuttle run.  I skipped this part of the Trail on Apr 27, 2017. Another cool sunny day that got a bit warmer as the day progressed. The hike started along several beautiful, peaceful streams. Flat then a downgrade to Laurel Fork Falls. This part of the Trail is backed up by a blue blaze alternative trail since the lower white blaze trail is very close to the stream and often under water. The steam was down so I got to hike the white blaze trail. Had a major 1800 ft elevation climb during day. Also had a chance to practice filtering water again so took it to ensure I had adequate water. Switchbacks and downhill at end of day. Worked my quads! Only wildlife today was a gray squirrel. Finished up today’s gap hike on schedule in 6 hours. Drive myself back to the hotel in Johnson City, TN to enjoy a dip in the pool and cocktails on the warm, sunny patio with Susie.

This gap hiking section is to cover the Trail I skipped on Mar 27, 2017. We stayed at Fontana Village Resort as our base for this leg of the gap hiking. Quite a bit of history here. The village, in the mid 1940s, originally served as the camp for the workers, and their families,  building the Fontana Dam. It is now a recreational lodging site for visitors enjoying the Fontana Lake and nearby hiking trails. Due to circumstances, we hiked this from North to South. We parked in the middle, near the dam, hiked north to the trailhead and then back south. Susie stopped at the car and I hiked on. Passed a cute family having fun talking about the “ dam” hike along the “dam” trail reveling in using the forbidden word in an acceptable context. In passing I said, OK enough of the “dam” jokes! :-)  I hiked back to the marina parking lot where Susie met me with the car. The latter part of the hike was along the lake. Saw purple and yellow trillium, a unique experience for me. Also saw one of the best shelters along the AT, one dubbed the Fontana Hilton. New construction that includes showers. Didn’t use it since we were staying in the Fontana Village Resort Lodge. So Gap Hiking was completed today. 28.7 miles total. I can now complete the last AT Section hike this year guilt free.

I decided to look for myself and wouldn’t you know it, found an adequate supply so all set for the evening. (Never take your first “No”).

Forgetful, a mid aged thruhiker originally from New Zealand who is a cellist now from NJ. No concerts due to Covid so he decided to hike the trail. His engineer wife is supporting him. Go figure! Saw other day hikers and thruhikers both north and southbound. Down for a bit then a fierce up to Mt Cube (who figures these names out?). Then down again.

(for a return to this beautiful area, for possible hiking with friends and family, etc.). With that in mind,  I stayed another day at the Moose Brook Inn. With thunderstorms overnight and a cloudy, drizzly day it was good to stay put for the day. Tomorrow’s forecast was a bit more promising. Talked with my wife by phone to catch up. Did a leg stretching walk into a convenience store for lunch provisions. Napped. Packed up full backpack. Yikes, it’s heavy! Can’t wait until I can return to more slackpacking but… need access points for shuttlers to extract me. Those seem to be uncommon up here in the Whites. Dinner was another door delivery to avoid walking into town in the rain. I’m a bit worried about starting again tomorrow. Oh boy, am I recovered?  Guess I’m as rested and ready as I can be.

In the morning ate up leftovers and a wide variety of bars, protein, fruit, juice, milk and coffee. Wanted to be fortified. Golden Waldo, my shuttler,  was early for my 7am pickup. Interesting guy. Spends winters in the south (Louisiana), summers in NH. Has trailers for residences in both places. Is 87 yrs old and likes to help out hikers. Had a big ole sturdy van and got me on the trail by 7am. A very unique guy and a big help. Cool,  breezy, sunny day but had lots of sweat on the rough ups and downs. Views were amazing with a few mountain flowers to add beauty to the day amidst the tight legs and fatigue dragging that pack up and down the grades! Passed by lots of NoBos (northbound thru hikers), some SOBOs. Lost a gaiter but some passing hiker alerted me in time to go back to retrieve. Very thoughtful! Fell short of my planned shelter destination but decided that 10 hours was enough for the day. Found a nice stealth site near a nicely flowing brook. Since I fell short for the day decided to save a bit of my planned dinner for later. Also started working the scenarios of how to plan out the upcoming miles within my available food.

Up at 5:30am to pack up interior of tent then, brrr, into the elements. Not too bad, had the right layers. After a light breakfast and cold caffeine in my Crystal Light, I was on the trail at 7:25. Met a SOBO- That Other Guy (said he was in a shelter with lots of Mikes. When he introduced himself as yet another Mile he was dubbed his distinguishing trail name). Got passed by a number of NOBO and some SOBO hikers including a group of nice young Amish men (telltale haircuts). Gentle trail grades then steep up to Mt Success (3565’) Met a young father hiking with his 3.5 yr old daughter. Cute as can be.

Finally onto blue blaze side trail to shelter. Lots of rocks on this trail as well but a downgrade so was tolerable. Got into shelter site at 6:30. Filtered water. Cooked a ramen and tuna pack hot meal. Stored extra food in the bear box provided and crawled into my tent at 8:30.

Lots of ups and downs, 3800’ peaks, vistas and rocks. A beautiful, sunny, breezy day. Came down Fulling Mill Mountain with some steep grades and iron climbing bars like in the photo. Got to and entered Mahoosuc Notch at 5pm. Young hikers there said it would take 1-1.5 hours to get through the Notch, a jumble of house size boulders that you climb over, around, under and through. A daunting feat with a full backpack. I was heading to a campsite on the other end of the Notch for overnight camping. I hiked hard, it was hard, but doable. Then it started getting dark. I figured I was almost to the end so I put on a headlamp and continued hiking. At midnight I got lost. Couldn’t get my bearings. No doubt fatigued, hungry and my phone mapping was not helping in the notch without good signal. Luckily in the middle of that boulder jumble I found a small moss covered flat spot to spend the night. It was too small and tilted to put up the tent so I slept on a ground cloth on my mattress in my bag. Finally settled down and got to sleep at 2:30am. I wasn’t panicking but boy was I tired.

Didn’t feel too bad. Packed up and was on the trail by 7-7:30am. Found trail immediately in the daylight but I think this is where I started to head in the wrong direction. Didn’t check my phone mapping since I figured signal in Notch was still bad. I also wasn’t thinking too clearly at this point. So I believe at this point  I was headed SOBO, the direction I came from the day before! I did stop at a water source and filtered water to rehydrate and eat some breakfast. I met an Outward Bound group of young folks with an adult leader. The leader gave me an extra energy bar since I was running low and wished me luck. I finally made it out of the Notch at 4pm. Turns out that this was the same place I had entered the Notch 23 hours earlier but I didn’t know it at the time. Yikes! I kept hiking thinking my desired campsite was coming up soon. No luck! I was hiking back up Fulling Mill Mountain again! Well, water was running out, food running low, energy running low, daylight running out, phone out of power. Paper maps not useful since I wasn’t sure where I was as a reference point. Decided to find a stealth site to camp on the top of Fulling Mill Mountain. It was a nice moss covered spot. I was tired. I was out of water so went to bed dry and didn’t eat anything since food would have been tough to choke down without water.  I had a bit of cramping and diarrhea at this point. Learned later that those are early signs of dehydration. Despite all of this I was fatigued enough that I did fall asleep pretty fast.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646062,"Slept pretty well with an occasional wake-up to realize I was a bit parched. I was still a bit disoriented . I packed up and headed out,  downhill, at 7:30. No water, no breakfast. Pretty soon I spotted a shelter! That meant water! Cool! Then I realized I was at Full Goose Shelter, a place I had been at a couple of days earlier. The full realization of my being headed in the wrong direction hit me! Very disorienting. Both my wingman Bob and my Guardian Angel, were at my side and working the magic. There was a group of guys there, one with extra food, another with a battery pack and cord compatible with my phone.Things were looking up.  I filtered water and worked hard at rehydrating. Tried to choke down some food. When dehydrated, eating food is not easy. My new best friends headed out but my phone was now at 75% power and I was also getting some energy restored in my body. But still quite depleted. At 9:30am I activated my Personal Locator Emergency Beacon. I got a pretty quick call from the Air Force Emergency Center in Panama City, FL. Apparently they coordinate this system around the world. This contact would have been impossible without a charged phone. My info was eventually passed to the local rescue and law enforcement who, in this case, were the Maine Game Wardens who have oversight for this area of the White Mountains. I then received a call from Sara Miller,  a Maine Game Warden, who was tasked with getting me out. I asked for  a helicopter to extract me. I felt so tired I didn’t think there was any other way to get out. Turns out they only send a helo for life or death cases. Too risky otherwise. Sara said I should start hiking out when I was ready. Yes, back up and over Fulling Mill Mountain for the third time!  I called my wife who was a bit concerned by this time not having heard from me (dead phone) but having heard from the rescue system. I can’t believe she puts up with me overextending myself. A saintly woman! :-)  I was about a half hour into the hike out when I was met by Sara and a colleague, fellow game warden, Mindy. Mindy, God bless her, carried my pack out. That helped a lot. They gave me electrolyte tabs, lots of encouragement and patience as we hiked up the mountain 0.5 miles then down the other side 1.5 miles. At the base of the mountain we were met by four rescue volunteers who, on a Sunday mind you, came out to help in case I needed to be carried out Warms your heart to see this dedication to help us folks in need. They even offered a Gatorade and a banana - very much appreciated. We hiked out a flat side trail that followed a beautiful, peaceful stream. Good for my soul at this point. They were patient enough to let me rest frequently since my energy was still low. Finally, after 4.4 miles we made it to a logging road where yet another volunteer and a full rescue equipment truck and trailer was waiting. Wow! Brings tears to your eyes - kind, caring folks. (I later donated to their local volunteer rescue outfit- I was touched!) . After I profusely thanked them, Wardens and volunteers went on their way and the rescue truck driver drove me 1.5 hours back to a convenience store for some food and beverage for me then to my hotel at 9:30pm. Luckily the front desk was staffed and I got into my room, a hot shower, a cold beer and some food. Lights out at 11:45pm. Long, long day! Think I dodged a bullet today.

She been a great assistance in this year’s hike. She was kind enough to clear her schedule to take me to the Portland airport on short notice, bless her heart. The 1.5 hour trip was through some pretty Maine countryside to the Portland International Jetport. We only missed one turn in spite of our talking and laughing the whole way. The airport’s name is a funny Maine-ism. Yes, like all airports, jets do fly in and out but,  well, it’s different here, so the slightly pretentious name. Oh yeah and no international flights leave or arrive here either, another Maine oddity! We made it in plenty of time. I tipped Marlene well, because she’s a life saver, and said goodbye.

Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646080,"Readers: Thank you for your readership, encouragement and patience. As you can tell from the date it has taken me almost 6 months to unpack this year’s section hike. It certainly didn’t evolve as I had planned. As always, you learn and grow from life’s experiences.  That was certainly the case in 2021. 
In the following blog epilogues, or epiblog as I call them, I’ll try to tie a bow on 2021 with segments on Stats, Covid, Gear, Strategies, Physical/Mental, The Experience and a Summary. 
Stats      AT Section Four Hike Complete 
AT MP 1768.4 - 1917.8 (minus gapped out trail segments). 87.2 miles hikedStates entered - NH, ME
Covid
I had my two vaccination shots so I was protected but still wary. Lingering signs of the pandemic remained.  Masks still required in airports and planes going and coming. Some shuttlers, restaurants and stores still asking for masking. It varied widely. But NH was intent on being over that. One store posted a sign saying masks not required and reminded all of the state motto, Live Free or Die. Guess we’ve seen examples of both throughout this thing! I did remain safe and virus free throughout. 
Gear 
With spreadsheets, lists and prior years’ experience I had all the right gear. Perhaps too much since the pack felt heavy. It weighed out OK, guess I’m just getting older! I found that my Sawyer water filter needed frequent backwashing  since the filtration rate was slowing. Grit in the micromesh filter pores. I bought a new Big Agnes Copperspur Ultralight UL-1 tent this year. I was going to lend my older version of this tent to my son (more on that later) . The new tent was nice and light and had a few new great features. Worked very well. My Osprey Exos 58 backpack had served me well over four years of section hikes. However it got beat up bad this year scrambling up and sliding down vertical rock faces. Some of the fabric and a lot of the mesh had holes. I returned to Osprey for repair. They instead sent me a brand new pack , in kind , at no charge. I was a fan before but now am a total Osprey devotee. Nice gear support.",,View Entry,"Dec 15, Wed",0
Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646083,"Strategies 
Slackpacking. As had been successful the past sections, I was looking to avoid carrying a heavy pack as much as possible by slackpacking. Stay in town, get shuttled to the trail daily with a light pack holding the day’s essentials. This was not as successful this Section because shuttler access points were not as available. So more pack dragging. The cell coverage was very spotty as well making shuttler comms a challenge. 
Avoid night hiking. By planning out distances I was able to do mostly day hiking. One hike got started late, went slower than anticipated and ended with a headlamp. Another case, as previously mentioned , was getting lost and doing some night hiking. Dangerous and it will, in the future, be something than is a last resort. Scary stuff! 
Plan manageable daily mileage. This was tough in retrospect. In previous years , depending on terrain, 10-13 miles per day were doable for me. The level of difficulty in the Whites caught me by surprise. I had dialed it back a bit in my planning but not enough. It’s amazing how robust you feel from your armchair. Way different when you are facing vertical rock faces in person. Yup,  a bit more mountain climbing than hiking in this stretch. 
Plan out long distance schedules. This was probably the biggest glitch in this Section. Did a day by day spreadsheet for 42 days and 424 AT miles. Nope, even with slack built in, I quickly found out it was a non-achievable schedule pressure cooker. The sad part is that I had my son , Derek, and my friend, Bob, built into this schedule for part of the hike - meeting times, flights, lodging, shuttlers all set up. I had to scrap all this when I was not able to meet the schedule even with gapping out sections. I owe them a profound apology! They pivoted nicely with vouchers for cancelled air and with alternate vacation plans  Still it added to the disappointment for all. I’ll plan to dial back on too much hard advance planning in the future. Tends to take the fun out of this AT experience. 
Physical / Mental
I trained pretty hard but always hard to do mountain training in flatland Michigan, even with creativity. A surprising number of sections were more mountain climbing than hiking. Slowed the pace quite a bit. The rocks were treacherous, especially the vertical faces. I suffered a number of falls which drew blood, bruises and bumps. (A precautionary after-hike visit to my ortho specialists confirmed that I did no damage to my artificial joints. I was relieved!) I got pretty good at stopping blood flow on the fly - to avoid wasting time. :-) 
Sometimes my body recovered a bit quicker than my mind during this Section. After a bunch of falls and some night hiking it was tough to get back out there. I added extra zeros to get over those humps. I think my mental toughness was challenged quite a bit on this stretch. In the end my physical exhaustion was the show stopper. Luckily my mental state was still there to listen to my body and call it off for the year. A tough decision but a correct one in retrospect.",,View Entry,"Dec 16, Thu",0
Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/646094,"The ExperienceThe Weather. Mother Nature was very kind in the Section. Cool, sunny, breezy was the norm. A little rain but not much. Made for pleasant hiking especially when a lot of climbs brought out the sweat which the breezes cooled off. The Humility. This Section, as much or more than others,  was indeed humbling. Just when you are feeling mighty,  you do a face plant and have to unbuckle and crawl out from under a heavy backpack. Placing every step carefully yet still have knee, shin and elbow scrapes from falls on the rocks. Patching up the bleeding quickly while watching darkness setting in. Definitely humbling.  The Vistas. With a lot of the summits above tree line the vistas were sweeping. After struggling to get to those summits they were all the sweeter. Really beautiful part of the trail while being the most challenging. The Area Outside the Comfort Zone. Do something every day that scares you. It’s why I do this. Challenge myself to do something new and see some place different. Some of that was very uncomfortable. However, I expanded my horizons, learned from my experience and learned a lot about myself. The People. As in previous Sections I was constantly awed by the kindness and generosity of people I met on the trail, in the towns and at restaurants and the lodging.  Very heartwarming especially those who provided of their time and talent in my rescue off the mountain. It always restores my faith in people. And finally, I am immensely grateful for the shuttlers who, with their life stories and their support of the hikers, always enhance my trail experience. Summary“That which does not kill us makes us stronger”, Friedrich Nietzsche.I didn’t achieve the planned mileage because of the White Mountain ruggedness.

Side Trail to Hut 1.1 hiking miles
This year’s Section 5 starts with filling in last year’s gaps. The approach this year is to shorten distances in these very formidable White Mountains and stay in huts in this section. Less weight to carry - no tent, cook stove or food since the huts house and feed hikers. Had my free breakfast at Woodstock Inn and Marlene picked me up for a short shuttle ride to the trailhead.  Hiking by 8:40. Had a rocky climb up right away. A bit humid so lots of sweat immediately. Passed some older SOBO (southbound) hikers - MTS and Lucky (said he’d been lucky for 10 years - didn’t ask backstory). Stopped at a campsite for more water then finally got to the top of the uphill, after 3 miles, onto Franconia Ridge. Ahh - flat! Well - kinda. Gradual upgrade with peaks- Little Haystack, Mt Lincoln and then ultimately Mt Lafayette, the highest at 5,260’. Rain on and off during day meant raincoat, pack cover and phone protector on and off as well. Really magnificent scenery but I couldn’t really enjoy it totally since on my first day out I was getting my trail legs and struggling a bit. Later in the day a fierce wind howled over the ridge. Rain, fog, sleet and at times, sun. I struggled to maintain footing at times. Exhilarating and exhausting all at once. At one point I slipped on a flat wet rock with no body damage but one of my trekking poles broke. Dang! Tried a repair right there on the howling mountain. A bit of duct tape and, nope … didn’t work. So I put the broken tip in my pocket. (Leave no trace (trash)) and extended the broken pole to roughly match the good pole length and off I went. Finally summited Mt Lafayette late in the afternoon then down a mile to the Greenleaf Hut (non AT mileage- darn!). In the photo the hut is downhill 1,000’ elevation in the dark spot on the lower left. Arrived at the hut at 6:30 after 10 hours of hiking. They had already served dinner but saved me some food. A wonderful meal with frosted chocolate cake for dessert. Who could ask for more? I was assigned a bunk in a whole bunk area to myself. Was nice for spreading out wet gear to dry.

Did morning prep, got my hair presentable and had my first cup of coffee by time the Croo sang their wake-up song at 6:30 to get all to breakfast at 7. Very ample- scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon, oatmeal, pancakes, juice. Brushed teeth, packed up and off by 8. First up to the Mt Lafayette summit, in 1.5 hours, then onward on the AT. Very foggy. The piles of rocks, called cairns (shown in photo), are helpful in the low visibility conditions for wayfinding. Was mostly downhill until Mt Garfield (these are called the Presidentials part of White Mountains, as you can see from the peaks named mostly after presidents). Along the way leapfrogged with two women who had stayed at the hut. They were great moral support during a tough hiking day. Lindsey and Ashley were friends from  Peace Corps time in Jordan over 15 years ago. Turns out Ashley lives in Ann Arbor, MI. Lindsey in Salem, MA. Still close long distance friends. We shared our struggles all day. I believe I didn’t get enough hydration so had intestinal and muscle cramps. Lesson learned. Lulu and Shushu, as they were nicknamed, went ahead and had the Croo hold some food for me. I finally struggled into the hut at 8:30. Another hiker guest gave me some salt tabs.

Slept very soundly overnight despite a nearby snoring woman in our full bunk room. Earplugs really helped. Popped up pretty refreshed, innerds included, and decided to sponge bath at the restroom sink. Felt great. Breakfast places set for 19. Usual hearty fare. Sat across from a couple of recent college grad fit young men who apparently have signed up for US Navy Seal training. They were gratuitous enough to listen to all my Navy stories. Quads still a bit stiff but overall body on mend. Called home and caught up. Best cell coverage was outside on their very rudimentary helicopter pad. (see photo) . Caught up on journaling. Chatted with Ashley about my next section of hiking off Mt Washington. She was familiar with that section and warned of very rugged conditions. Food for thought. Had a light bowl of soup for lunch ( addl cost-$2). Just what the body needed. The hut sold trekking poles! Leki brand, my favorite, so bought a pair. Back to a two full pole guy! :-) . Listened to one of my Audible books and that relaxed me into a hour and a half nap. More recovery! I tried to make a reservation at the next hut to get back on my previous schedule. Nope, all full so decided to hike out a side trail tomorrow with Lindsey and Ashley and take the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club) shuttle to next stop. During day met an adult camp counselor with the AMC system who, with another assistant, was leading a group of a dozen 15-16 year olds . They were energetic but well behaved and you could tell they were learning about teamwork and respect and, of course, nature. Pretty impressive. Got a pre dinner  presentation on how the hut supplies itself.  Fresh food packed in / some trash packed out by Croo members on 35-80 lb backpacks over a 4.6 mile side trail , pre season supplies and some post season trash out by helicopter, well water treated with a bit of chlorine, composting toilets that have to be stirred every now and then (ugh!), propane for cooking (propane in by helicopter) , solar panels for electricity.

Sounded like a travelogue with all of us discussing places around the world we’ve been and want to go. Made the hike go fast and we arrived in 3.5 hours in plenty of time for the shuttle. They were going in the opposite direction so I helped them find a shuttler from my AT White Blaze list of shuttlers. We had plenty of time to exchange phone numbers, emails and selfies. We promised to stay in touch after having bonded in a short time. My on time shuttle got me to the AMC Highland Center in time for lunch but early for check in. Turns out rooms ready early so after lunch I checked in by 2:30. Met a couple of great guys at checkin so we promised to meet up for dinner. Nice room with a queen and a two bed bunk (the grandboys would love them! ) . Smallest private room available. Well worth it considering rate includes dinner and breakfast and the privacy compared to the bunk room alternative. Used next bit of time to cancel hut at top of mountain to avoid treacherous mountain top and downhill hiking. Added a day in current location. Planning to take shuttle back during current extended stay to hike part of trail I skipped in last couple of days. Gap hiking part of gap hiking! What? :-) Did sink laundry. Called home. Dinner buffet at 6:30. Really a nice menu including beef tenderloin, stuffed mushrooms and strawberry shortcake. Also had wine by the glass available (a nice Pinot Noir on list). Sat down with the guys from checkin. Turns out they were brothers out training for a future hike in Switzerland. One of the brothers did a 2018 AT thruhike . Trail name - No Doubt. His best saying “Don’t quit on a bad day!” Had great dinner conversation amongst us retirees about careers, retirement and how we are all blessed to be able to do the things we do. Fun dinner. Returned to a cool dry room where most of laundry was already mostly dry. A great catch up and planning day.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Fri",0

Beautiful timber construction. A nice place to land!  Room cool, dark and quiet. Gentle mountain breezes were delightful. Enjoyed the full breakfast spread before jumping into scheduling mode - setting up shuttler for  tomorrow’s hike and working out the next couple of days lodging. Decided to skip the over the top of Mt Wahingtion route. Lots of steep rocks and rain threat. So cancelled a hut on the mountaintop (they were kind enough to to give me a credit despite non cancel policy) . Settled into contacting home, blogging, and audiobook catchup. A restorative day. Had a really great evening. In the open dining room decided to sit at a table with a lone woman diner. She later said she was glad someone sat down at her table so she didn’t have to look at her phone all through dinner. She was waiting for her daughter to arrive by bus from Cambridge, MA for a next day 20+ mile hike. Very fit woman who has five kids, lives in Ithaca, NY and operates a small travel planning business for high end groups on sailing cruises. She loves to travel so this allows her to meld work and play. Very nice dinner conversation trading life stories. Fun! She had to dash off to pick up her daughter at the bus station. Me - I grabbed another round of gourmet Swedish meatballs, zucchini fritters and salad and another glass of Pinot Noir. I then wandered down the hall to a conference room where a retired astrophysicist professor gave a talk on stars, planets and light pollution. Fascinating . He regularly partners with AMC for these kind of talks often using college students for the educational program. Then back to the room for final prep for tomorrow’s hike and lights out at 10.

Zealand Side Trail  2.5 hiking miles 
Early day today. Due to early pickup by shuttler (I wanted to get an early start anyway) I was first one into breakfast line at 6. Did quick breakfast and was packed up and meeting shuttler at 6:30. The game plan was to hike up a side trail and jump back in the AT for a 7.5 mile stretch than I had missed the previous days. Worked out great . Gorgeous day. The side trail was relatively easy and so did the 2.5 miles in a little over an hour. Sweet! Then onto the AT which had a gentle grade and mostly rock free for quite a stretch . Also a number of bog boardwalks which are flat. Clear sailing. Had snacks along the way and enjoyed a great confidence building hike all day. Only bummer was a slip on the rocks where I skinned a knuckle. A band aid stopped the blood leak with minimal delay. This was when my red bandanna came in handy to sop up the blood flow, so I could apply the dressing. When I emerged into the parking lot near Rt 302 (Crawford Notch) I had done the whole 10 miles (incl side trail) in about 7 hours. Way better than my first couple of days out. I was met by an older woman, very fit, who offered me a soft drink and a ride back to the Highland Center . A true Trail Angel. She thruhiked the AT in 2014 and still wants to give back to the hiking community. She was hiking the AT with her daughter so her Trail name was Mama Bear. Really a kind, caring woman and a real help to me. I didn’t have to hitchhike the 4 miles from the trailhead back to the Highland Center. I finished early enough for a nap, then cleanup. Excitement at the Center in the late afternoon was a helicopter aeromed training event on the lawn outside my window. The chopper came and went a couple of times. While watching the helicopter crew do their thing, I met two brothers, Matt and Dave, who were there for hiking a variety of trails for a couple of days. Ended up joining them for part of dinner. Dave, a child psychologist, Matt a financial planner. It was uncanny how similar he was to my planner, Ray. Personable, smart, optimistic, energetic. Chatting with those guys was a great way to enjoy my last glass of wine post dinner. The people you meet and the life stories they tell. The hikers I’ve been chatting with are also kind enough to ask about and listen to my life story. Restores your faith in people. A great cut of genuine folks out here.

First cup of Joe from lobby at 5:45. Love this Highland Center! Down to breakfast at 7 since no rush before 9am shuttle bus.  Was fortunate to be joined by Steve, from Chicago. There with a group of five friends and family from around the country who meet annually for a couple days of hiking. Small world- Steve has a daughter in Grand Rapids a couple miles from our condo. Visits regularly. Later got to visit with another of his group, a former Navy E-2 pilot. Fun guy. Earned trail name, Nose Dive, after falling into his pack after a couple of glasses of wine on a dehydrated stomach. He also elaborated on his new Tesla purchase. A big car guy! Sounded awesome, and expensive!  The group hopped off at a trailhead and I continued on to Pinkham Notch and my lodging for the night,  Joe Dodge Lodge,  (named after a long time AMC director). I was early for checkin so just decided to hike part of AT to the Mountain Auto Road  (goes to the top of Mt Washington). I hiked 2 miles of the AT uphill to the auto road. It was good to keep the trail legs tuned. Then 2 miles over same part of AT back down. Felt good. A few sprinkles but really opened up after I got back to Lodge. Just in time. Ended up getting 2-3 inches overnight. Glad I was in for the night. Lodge was a different concept. Individual rooms (with beds) and washrooms down the hall. Food served in another building. Dinner snd breakfast were included just like the huts. Cozy, very clean and confortable. Lounges at both ends of the building provided sitting space and coffee in the morning. Dinner was quite nice. Parmesan encrusted haddock, fresh baked bread and fixings including apple pie. Unfortunately this property is on National Forest Land , so no alcohol served.

Rain all night. A bit humid in room so kept fan going in absence of a/c. Up at 5:45 to drink lots of water then a cup of coffee in the lounge. On the way to breakfast noticed clouds clearing. Gonna be a good day! Breakfast was a bit bland but it’s fuel so down it went. On trail by 7am and enjoyed a bit of flat trail along a pretty stream. Then up, up for 3 miles. Lots of sweat, lots of slippery rocks from previous day’s rain and yes a few slips and falls. Got to practice my dressing skills on one fall to stop the bleeding on an elbow. Ugh! Hydration and nourishment were the challenges of the day. After 6 hours finally made it to the first high point. 2,000’ in two miles. Later up and over Wildcat Mountain, another 400’ and then down to Carter Notch Hut. Had a short rain shower but mostly breezy during the day and upper 70s. Made it into the hut at 5:30pm. Time to wash up and be in place for the 6pm dinner. This hut a bit different than previous ones. Dining in one building, bunks in a couple others and bathrooms in yet another building. As the photo shows, all the complex down in a notch and spread out. Dinner was very ample. Hearty lentil soup, a nice fresh salad, roasted asparagus, a vegetarian enchilada and rice entree and chocolate cake for dessert. Very filling. Not bad for being out in the woods! Had a table of 10 adults and a table with a seven person girls camp group incl 2 young adult leaders. Well behaved and they clapped with joy when asparagus was announced as part of menu. What? Surprisingly there was cell service so caught up with home after dinner. Prepped for bed and when 9:30 (quiet hour) rolled around the girls in the bunk room next door went silent. I had a bunk room to myself. What a luxury! Ibuprofen down and lights out. Tough day, a tough 5.9 miles, got banged up but slow and steady got it done.

Fitful night’s sleep. Too cool then too hot. Guess I was a bit overtired. And it gets light at 4:40. Tough to keep sleeping then. Up at 5:45 to washroom then down to dining hall to grab a first cup of coffee. Then back up to bunkhouse. Somewhat inconvenient especially since buildings are separated by rocky trails. My stiff trail legs not happy this early in day! :-/ Breakfast at 7. Curiously our table folks sat in same places as last night’s dinner. My immediate table mates were two boyfriend/ girlfriend couples. On second marriages and, well, outdoors is their new commonality. Again interesting to hear their stories. One lady’s interest, besides outdoors, is her horse. Heard a lot about her horse! On trail by 7:50 and did the first big 1500’ uphill for the day in 2.5 hours. Sunny, warm and humid day. I sweated as usual, fell a couple of times as usual (no blood these times) and enjoyed green mountain vistas often. Got into the shelter at 5:45 after a 10 hour day. This shelter had a caretaker. Caleb was a young black man who was very welcoming. It cost $10 to stay but was a very nice, well cared for location. Had a privvy, a bear box for safe overnight storage of food, an ice cold water source and a 12 person shelter. I rinsed the sweat from my face and head, rinsed out my sweaty shirt and put it back on and felt refreshed. Caleb was nice enough to boil some water for my chicken gumbo backpacker meal. I gambled that I could get hot water and have not carried my stove (to avoid the weight). Spicy, filling and great way to end the day at sunset. Settled into the shelter which I had to myself. What a luxury! Or so I thought. That changed in the middle of the night. More about that in the next posting. Another tough day but no major falls and got into the shelter at a decent hour.

Happy Birthday, Bionic Man! Great day to be alive and active. But, whew, what a night. I was settled in at 9 and in a deep sleep when a group of three hikers rolled in at 11:15pm. Yikes, how inconsiderate! For 1.5 hours they talked, cooked their dinner,  flashed their headlamps and then settled into the shelter. I did at one point ask what was going on. They said they were in late from hiking and would be settling down shortly. After that it took awhile for me to settle down. Not much sleep. Sunrise was early so I did my usual 5:45 am wake-up. They slept through it but at one point the adult in the group woke up and moved out into the woods in a hammock. We exchanged morning pleasantries. I decided not to go off on him. Nothing to be gained in that. I prepped, ate my breakfast and was off at 6:30 without them stirring. Oh well, life goes on. And for the first 3 hours I had the usual climb. Seems that the trail is set up where you sleep low (usual location of water) and , therefore, hike down in and then up and out. Passed a lot of hikers all day. Why do they all seem so fresh and fast?  It’s my third day out and I’m beat. Feeling my 71 years today. :-o  A bird (as shown in photo) landed close during one of my rest stops and perked me up. I got to a water stream about 3.5 miles from my destination and drank a lot. Heard from several hikers that the rest of the trail out was flat and beautiful. True story! There were a few sprinkles and some thunder but not much of what was predicted. Finally got cell service about 0.5 miles from US 2 so I contacted the shuttler, Golden Waldo, to give him my location. Apparently, based on a call a couple of weeks ago, he waited there at US 2 and then left even though my schedule was a guess. Oh well, told him I’d be out soon and so he did return to the trailhead. He was a shuttler I used once last year. He thruhiked the AT in 1986 and used the Golden Waldo trail name. He’s 87 and still hauling hikers around, bless his heart! We were on our way to my Bethel, ME B&B by 4:15. Got dropped off and met by John the proprietor who gave an extensive briefing. I was exhausted but tried to listen. Cleaned up and walked a few blocks to Sud’s Pub - a Cheers sorta place in the basement of an inn. Cold beer and some ribs and things were awwwright! Finally had cell service and some time so caught up on all the day’s birthday greetings. A warm feeling having all the friends and family reach out. Thanks,     All !

After a nice night’s sleep in a real bed, for a change, awoke with a start to a text ping at 7. Just in time for my 7:30 scheduled B&B breakfast. Really lovingly prepared food by Jeanette, the wife of the B&B team. After breakfast moved to the sitting room, This place is a lovely heritage structure so a sitting/ living room is part of the deal. Had a long conversation with Bob and Dana Fox. He 93, she a bit younger. Both spry. They told stories of their Maine cottage for summer use - off the grid. She’s a historian and birder lecturer so were in the Bethel area making the circuit. They listened and were interested in my story. Left me with their card and asked that I stay in touch. Heart warming . Headed to laundromat to clean up gear. While in wash cycle I headed up the street to the bank ATM for a withdrawal. Then back down for the laundry dry cycle and back to B&B to drop off clean clothes. It was then that I discovered my wallet was missing. OMG! Scoured room, retraced steps, revisited bank and let them know where I was staying in town. A moment of panic, no doubt. After revisiting the laundromat I received a call from the B&B proprietor that the bank called to say the wallet was turned in to the bank. Wow! Sigh of relief. Turns out it had fallen out of my shallow pocketed pants along the street. Someone found it. Saw my withdrawal slip and returned the wallet to the bank. Only interesting twist is that they removed all the cash in it first, Guess they took their finders fee right then. Oh well. Still better than trying to replace all my cards and ID out here. Bought lunch at the local grocery and celebrated the wallet return on the B&B porch with nice breezes. Yikes! Lesson learned!! Hook in your wallet more securely! Spent the afternoon recovering and journaling. Also set up shuttler for my last bit of gap hiking leftover from last year in Mahoosic Notch. Ziggy is going to shuttle me out to the trailhead on Sunday morning. Later in the evening I went out to a nice restaurant nearby, Brian’s. Very popular so no walkins without a reservation. But they did fit me in as a single at the bar. Very fortuitous. A guy sat next to me who, at first, was a bit standoffish. I didn’t push but eventually we struck up a conversation. He is the owner of an electrical services company and needed a break so his staff sent him off on a 3.5 week motorcycle trip through New England and perhaps out West. They told him not to call that they could handle it. It’s the most time he’s had off in ages. His separated wife still involved with business, strangely. His 19 year old son involved as well.

Here to hear 6th grade daughter’s piano recital at the end of a 3 week music camp.Yikes!  Sounds like she rules heavy over her daughter’s upbringing. Another couple struck up a conversation over common points of being scout leaders and a military (Marine Corps for him) background. Trip out later before the day turned too hot to the hardware store for more duct tape and to grocery for next couple of days hiking provisions. Caught up on blogs then out to nearby different, intriguing restaurant, Le Mu Eats, for lunch. Chef Owner grew up with Laotian heritage where “little pig” is a term of endearment. That translated into French is Le Mu. Chef Sayveppa “Sav” Sengsavang was hard at work at the grill. Notice, in the photo, the slips of paper orders above the grill - old style. Cook it and move the slips down the line. Later researched that he was a contestant on Food Network’s Supermarket Stakeout in Feb 2021. Celebrity Sighting! Had a gourmet BLT and delish Thai Tea. Amazing fare for this little town.  Very busy, popular place. Spent afternoon prepping for tomorrow’s hike. Stripping down weight. Downloading additional trail maps. Resting out of the day’s heat. For dinner decided to try Cho Sun, an Asian restaurant.  Heard good things about food. Was directed, as a single without a reservation, to the bar. A rather dingy place.

Had my usual gourmet breakfast and perfectly brewed coffee at the B&B’s 7:30am seating. Impeccable as always. Interesting breakfast crowd this time included a family from Madrid, Spain. The global map in the breakfast area has pins showing homes of guests from around the world. Was ready for pickup at 9am by the young man shuttling me, Ziggy. His trail name from a prior year AT thruhike. The goal was to get me back to the side trailhead from which I was extracted last year by the state rescuers. There appeared to be two ways to get there - one of which was shorter. Turns out this was one over back gravel roads which  had deep cross drainage cuts only passable with high wheel clearance. We were in a sedan - a no go, Had to turn around and go the long way around. Got a lot a conversation in with Ziggy by time he finally got me to the trailhead at 11:45. The demon here is the Mahoosic Notch. This is the place in which I got disoriented last year and which knocked me off the trail,  and where I was saved by the Maine Game Warden rescuers. Needless to say I had a high degree of angst going back in. I hiked the 2.5 mile side trail and entered the Notch at 1:20pm. The Notch is a mile long jumble of big boulders through with, over which snd under which you climb. Some spots are so tight you have to take off your pack and wiggle through. A surreal rock jungle gym. The surreal aura is compounded by the very cool air . The source is from snow below the boulder field which is still remaining  from the winter season. At one point I even saw my breath. Well this year I was rested, nourished, hydrated and so got through successfully in 4 hours. That’s a lot slower than other usual hikers but I conquered it by 5:20, gathered water before I left the Notch and found the tentsite on the end of the Notch. I was the first in the site so tucked myself in a nice corner and decompressed from the day. What a feeling of relief. Set up my tent , exchanged my boots for crocs and dove into my dinner of meats. cheeses, fruit and crackers. All no -cook so I didn’t have to lug a stove along, unnecessary weight. During that time a couple other hikers wandered in and set up. One of those was Sleepy from FL is a NOBO thruhiker. Not much conversation. We were both a bit tired from the day.  I decided to jump into the tent at 7. Way early but it allowed me to stretch out, relax and journal before dark. It felt great.

Overnight I heard some latecomers into the site. They apparently love fires so I caught whiffs of a campfire. Actually quite pleasant. I didn’t bring a sleeping bag, again to save weight. It worked out just fine with a silk sleep sack. I did add a fleece to my upper body as the night got cooler but the temps were very moderate. A good night’s sleep with the help of earplugs to mask the regular wind gusts. Turns out those were signals that the rain was coming. Sure enough, right when I was going to emerge from the tent and start prep for the day we were hit with a downpour. Imagine the dilemma of feeling quite cozy and comfortable right where I was in the tent yet knowing I needed to get started on a long day of hiking. I did get out of the tent during lulls on the rain to take down my bear bag (hung in tree to keep food from critters) and put on boots, etc. Ate in the tent, including caffeinated Crystal Light (boy that helped with my attitude when I was climbing throughout the morning!) and did other pack up inside and so when a rain lull came at 7:45 I jumped out, took down the tent, final packed and was on the trail at 8am. It started to rain again but I hiked on. It actually kept me cool. So instead of sweaty and hot and wet I was sweaty and cool and wet! :-) I was up Mahoosuc Arm in a couple of hours. The views as shown in the photo were awesome! Then the part up to Old Speck Mountain, the part they don’t talk about, came next. Hand over hand exposed rock face climbing in gusty winds. Not for the feint of heart! Reached a trail juncture that was the last cell signal before descending so checked in with the shuttler to estimate the time to hike the last 3.5 miles. Ziggy said it would take 3 hours. It ended up taking me 5 hours. Lots of downhill, wet rocks. Had to go slow to avoid slips and falls. My energy level also lowers as the day wears on. But I dug into that reserve they say you always have deep within. Was later met on the way down by Bubble Gum and Day 1 , two young section hikers from CT. They had arranged for a shuttle from Ziggy as well. Day 1, a young black man who was very talkative, hung with me and talked and walked me down. Very, very considerate young man. On the way he did discover wild blueberries for the first time in his life. He asked if those were OK to eat. I said go for it! The joy he got from that first experience was a wonder to behold. I finally made it to the Grafton Notch trailhead parking lot at 8pm. 12 hour hiking day. Felt every bit of it. Whew! Ziggy got me to my Bethel, ME B&B and then took the two hikers to Gorham, NH which is also his home. I was back in town too late for restaurants so I walked down to the 24 hour convenience store / gas station to pick up some beer and snacks. Drank a full Gatorade on the way back as I staggered up the hill to the B&B. Just sat there grubby, boots still on and savored the food and drink. Some flow of life returning to my body. Things never taste better than a reward like that after a major endeavor. Finally after that I did jump into the shower, then ibuprofen, then bed. Tired, achy, stiff. What a day! What a long day!  What a proud day to have conquered the demons that had been plaguing me for a year. Not sure about the remaining 266 miles of the AT. But,  for now, feeling damn good!

Again it took me 4 1/2 months to process this year’s section experience. In this and the following epilogue I’ll try to tie a bow on 2022’s Section Five with segments on Stats, Gear, Strategies, Physical/ Mental, The Experience and a Summary.
Stats: 
AT Section Five Complete.                                   AT MP 1917.8 - 1927.1 plus hiking of  previously gapped sections
AT Miles 52.9, Side Trail Miles 14.2 = Total 67.1 Miles hiked.
States: NH, ME
Gear: 
Backpack - My new manufacturer- furnished pack was a replacement (no cost) for the irreparable previous one. The new Osprey Exos 58 was identical to the previous and worked (and looked :-) ) great! Trekking poles - As noted in my blog, one of my original poles was broken in a fall. I replaced with new set of Leki Makalu Lite poles, the only available at the AMC huts. These worked splendidly and were very reasonably priced. 
Strategies: 
Using the AMC huts was a good choice to cut down on pack weight (no tent, no food, no cook gear) - a great relief in this rugged section. The huts were a good alternative to tenting, the only other choice due to minimal trailheads and therefore no slackpacking here. With no more huts northbound I’ll be looking into yet other new strategies to get this AT Hike completed - safely!",,View Entry,"Dec 07, Wed",0
Bionic Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/659541,"Physical / Mental: 
Had to start anew with regaining my trail legs / stamina, even with my training in flatland Michigan. Even with a lighter pack it was still tough with my advancing age. (Ugh! Tough admission!) . At times I dug deep for that hidden reserve. Luckily I always found it!Some falls with scraped and skinned elbows, shins and knees but less that previous years. I tried to maintain a slower, more cautious pace. The slow pace over tough terrain led to long exhausting days and low mileage. A real exercise in patience. Other hikers, I have heard, have had the same experience over this part of the trail. Mentally I tried to stay positive. not rush the experience and enjoy the moment. Had to balance this with a schedule at huts for a set dinner service time. I learned from a fellow hiker not to quit on a bad day. I didn’t quit and pressed on. 
The Experience: 
It was another really challenging section but, most importantly, I was able to revisit the Mahoosuc section and conquer that part of the AT said to be the toughest. I didn’t accomplish all of the mileage I had planned but I conquered a few demons and I finished safely. The weather was great, the vistas were breathtaking and the people I met on and off the trail were kind and memorable. It was a beautiful part of our country. 
Summary: 
I felt a renewed sense of confidence after conquering “ The Notch”, Also, after dialing down the mileage and the pack weight, the White Mountains were a bit more enjoyable.
With only 266 miles left I am confident I’ll finish this epic AT quest. Maybe a couple more years,  a couple more sections. Stay tuned! Thanks for your readership! Onward!",,View Entry,"Dec 08, Thu",0
