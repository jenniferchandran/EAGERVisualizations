Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578121,"Wilma and I have been planning this trip on the Appalachian Trail for about a year.  Although we live in different locations, we get together on occasion to talk about and plan our walk in the woods. We have been both working on getting in shape, lightening our backpacks to 25 lbs and no more, and sharing our excitement.  This is a hike we might have taken in our 20's when we were younger, but now we finally have the time to make it happen.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578407,"we hate to admit it but our kids were right, the pack was much heavier the anticipated. So we have a new plan, we passed a women's spa on the way....Just kidding.  We are going to lighten our load, and do day hikes the next few days...then add in an over night the next week. So that is today.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578518,"We spent the evening at the top of Powell Mountain vista point. We were all alone, or so we thought. In the middle of the night I thought I heard a man coughing...then Paulie thought someone or something was standing by her hammock. She felt something on the underside of her hammock. After hours and hours of frozen meditation on the possibilities for action, calmly (ha!) recognizing no smell of bear, or skunk or the Appalachian maniac (doesn't actually exist....) she risked everything. She turned on a light and asked me to check if anyone or thing was under the hammock. There was nothing I could see. We were both freaked out so she abandoned the hammock for my most amazing fortress of a tent.  We stayed up playing cards for awhile then finally slept a bit.  The sun slowly lit the sky with amazing color.  We went to the overlook and enjoyed the breeze, the color and the fact of surviving whatever visited last night. We ate breakfast, and hiked back down (ah sweet mystery of backpacking at last we found you) to Dick's Creek Gap. Tomorrow we will start at Tray Gap and hike to Unicoi with lighter packs and a somewhat new plan. We are nothing if not adaptable, thoughtful nature ladies. More ahead.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578521,"oops!  Almost forgot we met two angels named Lost and Sanford who shared conversation, tips and water so we could cook lunch. We reciprocated by taking their trash. Super nice.  Hope to meet again some year.And I  can't forget to always be grateful for my sweet man, Terry- aka Fred (I'm Wilma). He picked us up and continues to support our dream at each turn. Live him. Yes Willis- that makes you Barney.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578608,"Great night sleep in the long long trailer. Sunshine morning with cool breezes. Breakfast and then we're off. Fred drops us at Tray Gap not far from appalachian campground. Start walk with photo and then Betty is off like a shot! She's had 10 hours of sleep and I am just waking up. The walk planned is fairly low key, our packs are considerably lighter and the weather is much cooler. I couldn't be happier. Every curve in the trail offers a new chance for wilderment- bewildered by beauty. A tiny waterfall, a moss covered tree trunk that looks like green velvet. Birdsong and the merry breezes. It sounds hokey I know, but this is just so incredibly rich in all that lays before us. We meet Amber Alert at the junction to Rocky Mountain trail. She has taken the high road coming up from Unicoi. We consider taking that same road for the views, but opt for sticking to the trail thoroughly planned the night before by Betty and Fred. My strength is keeping us headed in the right direction. Betty is directionally challenged. I am planning challenged. We are a perfect match for our adventure. One thing still puzzles. Her affection for her jet boil. Every time she cooks she waxes poetic about how fab it is. I like it too. And she cooks so no grand problema. I love my part as her assistant in this. 
Lunch in the middle of the trail- no choice, no relatively flat space other than the trail. We continue to wind our way up and down and around the trail. We meet some people from Austin and offer them trail names- Rand and McNally because of their confusion about where they are and where they are going. They liked them and accepted our choice. We arrive at our destination at Unicoi without needing to refill water, without need for sherpas or paramedics. 
We are pleased with the choice for today, our happy trail adventure and look forward to more tomorrow. Fred arrives to pick us up and return us to the home base camp for showers, nap and dinner. Can't wait for tomorrow's walk in the woods.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578675,"We started out our hike at 10:30. Seems to be our hiking time. So the trail begins with a hike up Wildcat mountain. Didn't really want to go that way but we couldn't find the round about. We were glad we went up Wildcat mountain because the view was worth the price of admission! We then reached Tesnatee gap where we ascended the Cow Rock mountain. Georgia AT is up a mountain, down a mountain, up a mountain down a mountain...you get the idea. Once at the top of Cow Rock mountain, it's a ridgeline walk that offers large vista views, plenty of shaded trails. We met a Korean hiking club that was doing the same hike in reverse and Wilma got to practice her Korean. We met an older gentleman who was training for a hike in Maine, and he wanted to join the GATC hiking group. You have to be able to hike 6 miles a day comfortably if you want to join them. We reach the top of Wolf Laurel Top and breathe in the awesome view, and breathe. Oxygen- good. Then it's a bit of a downhill until we ascend Levelland Mountain. We start betting on guessing our correct end time. Whoever loses buys the beer. It's around 5 pm and I start worrying about sunset and hoping we get off the mountain before dark. On the way down Levelland we meet a group of young folks who have been hiking since Woody gap. They were looking for a place to camp. We reach Neel gap just as the sun is setting. Fred is there to pick us up. We love Fred. We go back to the trailer, eat a fine breakfast dinner Fred has prepared, pop in a movie, and fall promptly asleep. Today is zero day, no hiking just washing clothes, relaxing, and choosing our next hike. And that beer. Neither of us won the bet so we buy our own beer today.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578702,"Day off today. Laundry, planning, lunch with Fred.
Nap for me (Wilma) who didn't sleep so well. Mapping and plotting for Betty and Fred. Remember I keep us on track. I don't decide the track. I know my strength. 
We visit Helen GA. A quaint pseudo Bavarian town already celebrating Octoberfest. Drive to Ruby Falls in Unicoi State Park. Really pretty park, falls, river. Didn't walk to falls because I submarined that by thoughtlessly wearing flip flops. Didn't think a hike was in the plan. I'll do better next time. Betty missing her family but is catching up by phone. We're both doing well this evening. Ready for the next hike. Fred and Betty have Thursday night football to look forward to and I have a good book. G'night all. Until tomorrow.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578777,"Today we walked into the black forest of Hansel and Gretl. There were knotted trees, tangled roots and lots of boulders. We started our journey at the Bryce Reece Memorial Park. From there we decided to take the Freeman trail around the mountain instead of the AT up the mountain. We thought it would be easier. It was in that it wasn't straight up, it wasn't in terms of knarled trees, boulders and roots. I had to climb under 3 trees. Wilma was able to make it around them. This part of the trail was about 2 miles. We found a nice campsite to break out the ever popular jet boil for an ok lunch. We journeyed on thru any easy,beautiful path of trees and flowers. There were many squirrels out today. When we got to Jarred gap we turned right to go to Winfield Scott Lake. We were meeting Fred there. We waited patiently for our ride,and he waited patiently to pick us up, at a different location. GREAT SCOTT! After an hour we finally met each other. We met a lot of great folks, mostly from the south. One couple went to far and missed the Freeman trail and had to double back. We met two guys who were scouting the trail for his friend that worked for gaft to see how the damage was and what trees needed to be worked on (lots). Near the end of the journey we met a family of 5 or 6. The dad had a toddler on his back, brave man. Tomorrow we do Woody gap to jarred gap, maybe. B etty is crashing her toes, don't know how they will be in the morning.","

Dick's Creek Gap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578834,"Today was a little bittersweet day. Our last day this year on the AT. One very full week. Our senses are over loaded with all that we saw, felt, heard. We all know these beautiful places are there in our heads, but the up close and personal is something our hearts will hold forever. 
Start this morning at Woody gap was so cool and breezy. Lots more hikers on the trail- Saturday or proximity to Atlanta? No clue but as we reached the 1 mile mark, top of the hill with panoramic view, the numbers of hikers decreased dramatically. Ah! Trail from here mostly fast walkers. Saw a guy with just running shorts and a hydration vest making time, others with a quick hi and on their way. 
We did meet one guy who took a bit more time. The trail was narrow so we squeezed to one side and let him know ""we are passable"".
Later passed him and then even further on he approached to pass us and said, "" Ah! The passables!"" Maybe a secondary trail name there. 
We resemble that remark in both definitions. No problem. John Muir said we should saunter, not hike. Wilma and Betty embrace this advice. 
Passed so many downed trees today. More than any other day. The size of them is mind boggling, imagining them cracking in the wind and falling to the ground. The force of the storm (hurricane Irma) along this portion of the trail must have been something fierce. It's hard to see. But then you pass another that has been down for many years and the circle of life along this trail softens the blow. A bit. 
Along the trail someone has cleared a tree and surprisingly created a little chair complete with back and footstool. We are so grateful and amazed at the dedication of the people who maintain this trail. And so two slightly older ladies close out an adventure together that didn't go exactly as planned, but was still incredibly worthy and hopefully only the beginning of more sauntering together in the time we have to share. Wilma and Betty, signing off.","Woody Gap
