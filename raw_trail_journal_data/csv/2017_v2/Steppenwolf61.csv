Steppenwolf61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557109,"Well, I leave for Atlanta tomorrow to meet up with my friend Mark C. from work, grab dinner, and crash at his house overnight before being dropped off at the Amicalola Falls State Park to check-in for my final night before hitting the approach trail to the Appalachian Trail on Friday, March 24. It's been over a year of preparation and months of exercise to get myself as prepared as possible for my extended section hike of the trail. I feel relatively in shape although still recovering from a nasty cold of two weeks ago, so I will be taking it slow the first few days of my hike as hopefully this old body readjusts to the weight of my pack and the ascents and descents of the trail. When I started seriously thinking of attempting this hike I was planning to start on March first as Highlander58 had done in 2016, but decided earlier this year that a March 24th start made more sense. Based on the YouTube videos that I watched from last week of Hikerfeet (""Dirty Bunny"") and others, I'm glad I did as they encountered a week of extremely cold weather and plenty of snow.So I leave tomorrow with mixed feelings of excitement and worry as I prepare to meet this new challenge in my life. I suppose I should thank my previous employer for making this all possible by eliminating my job in January of this year. If I had still been working then I would not have been able to take off the 35 days or so that I plan to hike this section. People have asked me if I was hiking the entire trail and I have explained that I prefer to stay married and believe my wife is being quite kind in allowing me this time away. I leave wondering if I even want to be away from here this long, but journeys taken can reveal a lot of truths some of which I will uncover during my hike. Others that I already know. Stay tuned to see if I can handle what should be the ""heaviest"" pack on the trail. God Bless!!","Cincinnati, OH

Steppenwolf61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557356,"I spent yesterday driving to Atlanta and having the good fortune of my good friend, Mark Crosslin, volunteer to be my shuttle driver for the next two days. Having shared dinner at PF Changs, we retired to his lovely home for the evening. Thursday began with a hearty breakfast at Loretta's Country Kitchen where Mark graciously bought my meal for my 61st birthday. After a few quick stops, we then drove to Amicalola Falls State Park for lunch. Mark dropped me off at the Visitor center where I signed in and then gathered some pics at the stone arch signifying the start of the 8.8 mile approach trail to Springer Mountain, which is the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Mark said his goodbyes and off I ventured to complete the 1,100 odd foot ascent of Amicalola Falls without my 42 lb. backpack. The day was sunny and warm at about 58 degrees. It took me about the first 1/4 mile to acclimate to the rapid ascent, but I soon completed my first mile. Tomorrow begins my section hike where I will ascend another 2,000 feet or so and eventually walk about 11 miles. Thanks for all the words of encouragement, and thank to Mark for his help and generosity. I am anxious now to begin my hike and test my mettle against whatever Mother Nature plans to throw at me. See you all in the woods!!!","Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge

Steppenwolf61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558172,"Left the lodge at 8:00 am after grabbing a hot breakfast at the lodge. I began my hike full of doubt in my ability and an anxious excitement for what I would experience. It was a bit cold and windy which was a precursor to what I would contend with on the 8.8 mile approach trail to the official southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain at 3,782 feet, and I was starting at 2,642 feet. My first obstacle was Frosty Mountain which tops out at 3,884 ft. and gave me my first taste of ascending a mountain. While I was fresh from the lodge it didn't take long for me to pause often to catch my breath before ascending another 20 - 30 feet.I was alone at the time and still a bit embarrassed by how much effort it took to get over the top of Frosty. And as I would soon find out, any ascent is quickly followed by a descent which took me to Nimblewill Gap down at 3,100 ft. Conditions were cold and foggy, with a strong breeze from the windward side of the trail. The fog gave the landscape a mystical feel, especially walking by myself.After what seemed to be a never ending ascent of Springer Mountain, I finally arrived at it's 3,782 ft. peak, and very windy conditions and a drop in temperature forced me to seek some protection from the wind at the shelter located there. Since it was only 12:30, I continued down the mountain in search of Stover Creek Shelter. It took 4.5 hours to complete my 7.8 mile approach.Stover Creek was 2.8 miles further north as I proceed down Springer under a brightening sky. About 2 PM I finally came to my first creek and decided to collect water for the first time. I finally approached Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30. So on my first actual day on the trail I figured out how collect, filter and drink water out of a creek, but I also learned my first valuable lesson of the trail; never walk away from your tent as you set it up without staking it to the ground. I was walking up to the shelter from my campsite when everyone began yelling that my tent was blowing away down the hill. Pretty funny, but I could have damaged my tent on the first night. I met three brothers and their nephew from Wisconsin, but didn't hold it against them since I am a Buckeye fan. They were very funny and it was great to meet them.I grabbed something to eat and settled into my tent after collecting more water after my 11.6 mile day walking from 8:00 until 3:30.   ","Amilcalola Falls Approach Trail
