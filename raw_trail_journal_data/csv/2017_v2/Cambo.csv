So I'm at it again, for at least the next 30-45 days. A return to the AT where, nearly two years ago now, I started off on a hike for the ages. I invite anyone who wishes to follow again to relive my adventures in a new year, a new hike, new characters, and what will ultimately be a new adventure. Your support, as always, will not go unnoticed, and will be greatly appreciated.
After a somewhat bumpy start to 2017, I decided to take advantage of my hiking itch and spend some time on what ultimately became the AT. Even though many hours were spent researching other trails such as the Florida Trail and the Great Enchantment Trail, the AT eventually became the logical choice after being delayed a month waiting for car repairs to be completed. With the previous experience under my belt, I decided time on a trail that taught me so much about myself, only this time knowing what to expect along the way, would me by next course of action before potentially attempting the PCT later this Spring. I say potentially in that my plane ticket has been purchased, I spent time on the phone with my old AT buddy, General Burnsides - picking his brain after his 2016 PCT thru-hike (and also chatting to Moosehead in the process as well), and 30-45 days on the AT will provide sufficient time getting in the best mental and physical shape possible. However, I'm open to the possibility of feeling ""nyeh"" after the next month plus, that this round in the woods was sufficient, or, as several of this new year's crop of thru-hikers have suggested - why stop if I make it that far? The AT has always, and does so after today, hold a special place in my heart and it continues to nudge me gently, whispering in my ears in the process, ""What do you say?"" For now, however, a point in southern Virginia remains the exit point this time around, still nearly 520 miles away.
I send to a big thanks to my old high school friend, Brandie Wheeler, and her husband, Shayne, for hosting me for a day before I was due to bus out of Evansville, IN. Brandon's father has been kind enough to watch my vehicle during this time, a gesture no amount of thanks can show show how grateful I am. After a day of catching up, good laughs, and solid company, Brandie saw me off at the bus station for my 8-hour ride to follow. Being a 7pm departure, I knew I was in for a restless evening, which unfortunately was proven accurate. I met my first thru-hikers in Nashville and, after reaching Atlanta at 3am, spent the next seven hours chatting about my past hike, and offering him any advice to the questions he had. Eventually he was off and i was left to fight the physical and mental stress that accompanies an extended period of no sleep. At 11am i made my way to the MARTA station and began heading to North Atlanta where a shuttle to the Hiker Hostel in Dohlanega, GA was due to pick me up at 1pm. This is, of course, after I boarded the wrong train and ended up closer to east Atlanta. However, with plenty of time to spare, I made it to my destination, and was able to score some Chic-fil-A in the process. The kind words from the manager had signaled the return of the kind of kindness only found in a place like this.
At 1pm I crammed into a bus with eight other, mainly quiet hikers. Brothers from New Jersey, a couple from Michigan, friends from Ohio. After an hour ride and a quick stop at a Walmart, we arrived at the Hiker Hostel which, as I had previously heard, was the nicest hostel on the trail. Point proven. Hand-built by the owners, thru hikers of a decade ago, it's built on a slice of Georgia perfection, nestled just outside the shadow of Springer Mountain, overlooking mountains to the east. A super relaxing stay in a clean, welcoming, beautiful place, I couldn't have asked for a better evening - mainly for the comfortable bed calling my name. A shower, chatting with hikers, a breakfast of eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, grits, and coffee, and a shuttle to the trail head. What more could you ask for? Cheers to the awesome staff that has devoted the past decade giving back so much to the trail.
Exiting the shuttle at 9:30am, I originally planned to head north from the parking lot, a mile north of Springer, not worrying about the 2-mile round trip to the summit. However, being such a beautiful morning, I made the trip and was able to grab a view pictures and enjoy the view I wasn't provided two years ago. The next few hours were spent hiking solo - music in, my muscles strong, and legs relearning the terrain. With only a couple hours of music time so far, I'd like to report I'll be much happier with my selection, having had plenty of time to update it - no John Denver anymore, for one example. Just after noon, I entered an open field draped in sunlight - the location of my first trail-dump. Sitting nearby were Purple Pony and ""just Sarah."" Purple Pony is from southern Indiana and, as her husband maintains their farm, will be attempting a hopeful thru-hike. Sarah is 21, from Michigan and, with her beautiful husky, Odin, will also be attempting a thru-hike except for the places her dog cannot go - the Smokies, for one. If he doesn't go, she doesn't go. The bond between them is undeniable after spending the remainder of the day hiking with her while he dashed across the trail, chasing what-nots and what-have-yous, but always stopping to catch her eye before going too far. Caught in an early void I'm an otherwise busy time for hopeful hikers, we stayed together and enjoyed the company the comes with learning about someone new - reason for hiking, brief family history, and pre-trail lives. Eager to scoop up whatever advice I could give, I provided my share of such as well. We pushed at a slow, though steady speed, over what will eventually be viewed as minor hills. Stopping at potable water tank left by he Army that uses the area for training, we relaxed and waved hello and soldiers drove by - the red cross of the medics painted on the side of one.
Once over the really only butt-kicker of the day, ""Kiss my ass"" Sassafras Mountain, the remainder of the early evening would descend relatively downhill until reaching Gooch Mountain Shelter just before 6pm. As the last arrivals, much of the shelter and surrounding camping spots were claimed by the two dozen or so hikers there. After a quick dinner of hydrated rice, crackers, nutri grain bars, and a honey bun, a ridge runner suggested a stealth site on a low ridge some ~200 yards away. ""Just Sarah,"" Oden, and I made our way over and enjoyed the last couple hours of evening in a nice area by ourselves, continuing our chats until hiker midnight of 9pm arrived. It's currently just after 9:30pm, ""just Sarah is snoring, and I'm wrapping up the first entry of what couldn't have been a better day to start another walk in the woods. A good introduction back into the woods, and the culture that comes with it. Feelings will change as the aches, soreness, and the endless starving most surely return. For now, a bright moon fills a star-studded sky overheard, the air is crisp and cool, and aside from the dreaded enemy resonating from the tent nearby, today was an enjoyable one, and I was quickly reminded of what makes this a special place.","Springer Mountain

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624642,"Day 02: Gooch Mountain Shelter, GA to Blood Mountain Shelter, GA - 13.2 miles:
Awake at 6am after a sleepless night consisting of a rotation between freezing and drenched in sweat, I was glad when my alarm chimed for the start of my second day. With my gear packed and my first deuce out of the way, I made my way ~200 yards to grab Sarah's food bags stored near the shelter, Odin keeping company at my side.
Just before 7:30am, we strolled outta camp, the goal of reaching the old stone shelter perched atop the rocky outcroppings of Blood Mountain. Another cloudless day promised a beautiful sunset at the completion of the day. After the first five miles, Sarah, Odin, and I reached Woody Gap where a few hikers sat enjoying not only the first trail magic of their season, but also their lives. It was a pleasure watching passing hikers thank the trail angels - one, a 2016 thru-hiker - from nearby Dalohnega. I enjoyed a banana and two cans of Mt. Dew. Sarah polished off two bags of Doritos and a Mt. Dew, and Odin continued playing what has become a game of using his large, soft eyes and innocent stare as a way to score rations from any hiker who falls victim. Chips, Star Bursts, donuts, ice cubes, and even a can of chicken and Spam I found in a nearby bathroom - the dog has made quite the killing in his three days on the trail so far.
After another ~4 miles we reached Lance Creek, a special place to me due to it being the location I received my trail name of from Rock Boat nearly two years ago. It made me recall his Forest Gump impressions, and I missed him at that moment. The remaining ~5 miles of the day would be a series of ups and downs, gradually leading up to the climb up Blood Mountain. With just under a mile from its summit, Sarah and I reached a side trail promising water. After following it for nearly 10 minutes, we decided it was a path to nowhere before returning to the AT and gambling a water source was just ahead. With only just over a liter between us, it was a setback when we discovered we had lost the bet. With evening approaching, aching legs, and Odin unable to keep himself from falling asleep within moments of stopping, we decided to reach the shelter and endure an evening of little water.
After reaching the summit and finding a place to pitch our tents, we were able to enjoy a great evening under the stars after first watching the sun disappear behind a ridge to the west. As we sat on an exposed rock cramming in mouthfuls of junk food, hunkering from the cold wind in the few warm items we have, we were joined by three people originally from Venezuela. On their way across the country, their first stop was to Blood Mountain to enjoy the soft yellows, oranges, and pinks spreading out before us. Immediately attracted to us due to the help of Odin's ""feed me"" game, they talked of seizing life and adventure. As they offered us a dish of rice, plantains, and tomatoes, I listened as their accents flowed and danced like the star-studded sky above. At 8:30pm, Sarah and I said we unfortunately needed sleep and, arousing Odin from his warm spot in an indention in the outcroppings, we parted ways. As we left, Coco, Eduardo, and D told me I'd always be one of their pantas - or bros. Though only one of many brief relationships that occur on the trail, they wont be forgotten anytime soon.
It's now 9:30pm as I wrap this journal up. Sarah just updated me on the approaching weather, and it now makes sense why this mountaintop is empty, save a half dozen or so people. Storms should be rolling in within a few hours, a complete contrast from the clear skies above. At ~4,400ft, this night has the potential to get pretty hairy.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624643,"Day 03: Blood Mountain, GA to Low Gap Shelter, GA - 13.9 miles:
Mother Nature put on a good show in northern Georgia last night. After a few light hours of sleep, the first raindrops began knocking at my rainfly at 2am. By 3am, she unleashed a couple hours of pouring rain, 30-40mph gusts of wind screamed up the sides of the mountain and onto the lonely souls atop, lightning lit up the sky seemingly just beyond my rain-fly, and a chorus of thunder bent on crumbling the foundation of Blood Mountain.
As the wind funneled into the side of my tent, the rain-fly was nearly useless as it sat flush against my tent, allowing a slow, but steady mist of water through. The west side of my tent nearly caved in from the pounding wind, but I was able to keep it up by opening my tent door, opposite the wall, and angle my trekking poles between it and the ground outside. This cut my already one-man tent in half, leaving my body twisted around the poles for the next few hours. I used my pack liner to cover the exterior of my pack, my rain jacket covered the upper part of my sleeping bag, and my pack cover held its own on the lower half. Although a sizable puddle formed beneath my sleeping pad, and my tent all but soaked, I was fortunately able to stay dry, along with the majority of my gear. After a sleepless night on her end, Sarah and I were up and determined to get off of Blood and were moving by 7am.
An hour later we reached the friendly confines of Mountain Crossings nestled in Neels Gap, in the shadow of Blood Mountain. I entered and immediately saw a friendly face, now working there as she waits for her PCT thru-hike later this Spring - Star Crunch. After a quick hug, we jumped into catching up. She gave me a discount on a pillow I purchased to hopefully help with my lack of sleep. Even after nearly two years, she knows the way to my heart after giving me a Coke for free. Appreciate you, Star Crunch, and best wishes in your upcoming trek. After a quick snack of Funions, Lays, and two Star Crunch snacks, I wandered over to the sad sight that is the bathrooms for the outfitter and attached hiker hostel - a row of yellow porta potties. After adding my share to the growing collection, I was able to look back and admire the artwork of previous hikers - a variety of colors ranging from burnt umber to Dijon Mustard yellow. I also noticed work left at sharp angles compared to the seat and wondered at what force something must exit the human body in order to create it.
After just over an hour of recouping from he night before, Sarah, Odin, me, and a about a dozen other hikers made our way back into the mist and high winds of the mountains that would last the rest of the day. The remainder of the day would consist of relatively minor ups and downs, and groups of hikers playing tag as we flip-flopped one another on the trail. Odin continued being Odin and is fun to have around, as he provides entertainment running all over the nearby woods, easily doubling the miles we have walked each day. At 12:45pm, the clouds finally broke for the day, and the winds subsided just enough to allow us to break in a sunny patch along an overlook. With tent gear spread along the ground drying, we lounged in the unusually warm March sun and relaxed. Just over an hour later we were able to motivate ourselves to get back to it.
A minute later, we rounded a bend where the trail briefly opens up to exposed flat rocks as it begins its drop toward the next gap and Wildcat Mountain beyond. An older gentlemen named Andy, though youthful in character and heart, standing with a few other people, asked us if we were thru-hikers as soon as we approached. After we confirmed we were, he said he needed to talk to us. He then presented Sarah with a hand-carved oak walking staff as a gift. He explained that he makes several each season, and gives them as random forms of trail magic in hopes the hikers will travel with them to Maine or, at minimum, as far as they're able to go. All he asks is for the hiker to occasionally update their Instagram with their whereabouts. Having been without twerking poles and co soldering getting some, Sarah was surprised and very appreciative. As she chatted with Andy, I chatted with a friend of his who is spending the year in northern Georgia. Having always wanted to learn about the hiker community, he hopes to get out to the trail as much as he can over the next month to meet hikers. I fielded questions for him and told him he was most definitely in the right place.
Sassafras seems to get a meaner rep than Wildcat Mountain, but Wildcat is one of the few that stuck with me from my previous hike. Though both are eventually seen as mere bumps in the long run, they represent some of the first decent ascents in Georgia. Though easier than my original climb, Sarah and I summited and enjoyed a much-needed drink of water. Knowing this was the last decent climb of the day, the remainder of the afternoon was more gradual ups and downs as the trail gradually descended towards Low Gap Shelter. With high winds rushing over the summits and drowning out most other noises, I spent most of the afternoon listening to my music. We eventually began our final one-mile descent into Low Gap Shelter, arriving at camp just before 6pm. With plenty of hikers hulled up at the Mountain Crossings Hostel the previous night due to the storm, the area was dotted with a patchwork of tents - greens, blues, reds, and yellows. Fortunately we found an area large enough for our two tents nearest the trail, and not lower down in the gap near the shelter.
We sat near the shelter to scarf down dinner - more crackers, tuna fish, and chocolate for me, along with a bite of cheese and summer sausage offered by Sarah. Odin won't touch his Kibbles unless flavor is added to it - most likely due to all the handouts he receives from hikers - so Sarah mixed it with tuna fish, and I tossed in some peanut butter crackers. This pleased Odin, and we were deemed worthy in his eyes for another evening. We then joined a group of ~10 hikers around a campfire, with names like Peanut, 2.0, Pyro, and Tank - chatting about the day, the next, or food.
With the valley already beginning to darken for the evening, Sarah and I made our way to our spots and set up our tents in order to escape a little of the cold wind that began funneling down from above. The moon is nearly full tonight, illuminating the surrounding woods in an eerie light, casting long shadows -day at night. It's, once again, about 9:30pm as I'm wrapping this entry up. So far my feet are good, legs are good, mind is good. Something is obviously not good with Odin, though, as he lets out a few barks at bumps in the night, most likely irritating some sleeping hikers.
Cold weather is soon approaching as Sunday calls for potential snow and a few days with highs in the 20's-30's, and lows in the teens. Me and my gear will most likely be put to the test.","Blood Mountain Shelter

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624644,"Day 04: Low Gap Shelter, GA to Unicoe Gap, GA - 9.7 miles:
The night brought temps in the upper-20's, which left me tossing and turning, searching for warmth, but never finding it. I stuffed the lower part of my sleeping bag into the plastic liner inside of my pack which at least saved me from cold feet. At some point later in the morning, I did fall asleep, eventually popping my head outta my mummy sleeping bag to notice it was well past the start of sunrise. At 6:45am, the cold air bit at my skin, slowing my progress and desire to exit my tent. After a quick trip for a deuce in the nearby woods, Odin in support, Sarah and I hit the trail just before 8am.
The morning brought a relatively easy stretch, consisting of small ups and downs, but remaining at relatively the same elevation over several miles. Passing Poplar Stamp campsite, I remembered two years ago when Rock Boat, Star Crunch, Airlock, and me shared the spot. The going was pretty easy, allowing me the time to meander off the sides of the trail to snap pictures of icicles, some up to a foot long, hanging off the sides of wet, moss-covered rocks. Tightly packed thin slivers of ice also coated patches of dirt stretching along the trail, Mother Nature's way of teasing me with what appeared to be blooming onions, minus the delicious fried part.
After a few hours of hiking to music and chatting about the trail, we reached Blue Mountain Shelter just before 12pm. Sitting just off the side of the trail, Sarah scarfed down an assortment of snacks, sharing with me a bite of a Cliff Bar and Slim Jim in the process. I decided to pass on lunch and was instead petting Odin who was lying on the trail in front of me. After looking at the trail guide and weather forecast, we noticed rain and potential snow tonight. After just drying out the day before after the storm atop Blood Mountain, we had no desire to push our gear's limits again. The weather over the next several days brings temperatures in the 20s-30s, with lows in the teens. Having been uncomfortable last night in only the upper 20s, we decided to try and avoid at least one of those nights by going into town. We decided to hike another 2.5 miles down into Unicoe Gap and hitchhike into Hiawassee, GA since I was going to need a food supply anyways.
We quickly reached Unicoe Gap where we had the surprise of two different groups, set up near one another, offering trail magic - hamburgers, hotdogs, fruit, drinks, toiletries, light reading material, etc. One of the groups consisted of teenagers and their leader from a church in southern Georgia. Within seconds I was given a plate with a hot burger on it and pointed in the direction of the condiments. Some ketchup and mustard, a slice of cheese, a sprinkle of pickles. Perfect. Odin, using his soft eyes and raising a single paw, conned me into a couple pieces of it. I should know better by now. I grabbed a picture of the group and, before attempting to hitchhike, was asked by the leader what we wanted their church to pray for in our journeys. They had a signup sheet signed by hikers, most involved success or no injuries. I told him simply, ""A daily reminder of what's really important."" After plenty of thanks, we heading to the opposite side of the parking area, some 30 yards away.
I encouraged Sarah to stick out her thumb and attempt to land her first hitchhike. Though a little nervous, she stood valiantly as a handful of cars passed quickly. No luck. Eventually a taxi appeared and I remembered the driver from two years ago, having given me a ride into Hiawassee, GA. Though bit of a strange cat, I chatted with him about a lift for the three of us, along with another hiker, who had initially called for his service. He informed us that the majority of hotels in Hiawassee we're already full and he'd prefer not to take us into town, only for us to be stranded with a room. Having Odin in tow, it can be a bit trickier of a process when it comes to hitchhiking and finding a place to stay. After a series of calls into the town of Helen, about as equally far from the trail in the opposite direction, Sarah was able to find what I can only assume was one of the last options to stay that also allowed dogs.
We returned to the other side of the parking area in order to try and land a vehicle now heading west. After only about 10 seconds, I was able to land the first vehicle I attempted. Our driver, Ryan, and his daughter, McKala, were more than happy to take us down into Helen. Ryan said he'd noticed the dog sitting by the road, so I guess Odin has his perks after all. After a 20-minute ride down out of the mountains, we slowly rolled into what I'd consider the Gatlinburg of Georgia. Long ago Helen embraced its German heritage and capitalized by creating a German-themed tourist trap of a town. The sidewalks were packed with civilians walking mindlessly between gift shops, toy stores, a variety of eateries, a beer garden, photo shops, all more than eager to take their money.
Sarah, Odin, and me walked into our room at the Helendorf River Inn, one of the several hotels designed in a corny German design. Even the Wendy's next door was built to appear German. The whole town fails to pull it off because it has tried too hard. However, it was a typical weekend and the sidewalks were busy with the throngs, so maybe they're on to something. Regardless, the town is a bit cooler, if only in a funky way, compared to Hiawassee on the other side of the mountains. Our room was a bit outdated, but would definitely be more comfortable than what some hikers will deal with overnight on the trail. We quickly took showers, spread out gear a cross every square inch of the room, and then walked across the small downtown to Betty's Country Store in order to take care of a quick resupply. For me, it'd be a few packs of Tuna, a can of sardines, a couple rice sides, and chocolate bars - enough to get me to at least Franklin, NC. I also snagged a bag of kettle chips and a 6-pack of Hofbrau beer in order to blend in with the locals. Had there not been so many people, plus Odin waiting back in the hotel room, we probably could've made a meal out of the free cheese and chips and salsa samples.
We then walked back across town, through the shuffling crowds and German music playing over some hidden speakers, and made our way into the Wendy's next to the hotel. A simple spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and a Coke for me - the hiker hunger has yet to really kick in. Sarah would make do with a backnator. We returned to the room to find Odin in good spirits, happy after his hour-long nap. The remainder of the evening was spent eating, chatting, washing our clothes in the sink, and overall being sluggish. It's closing in on 11pm and, with the time change overnight, will haven't done myself any favors in the sleep department.
We'll return to the woods tomorrow, climbing towards Tray Mountain as soon as our feet hit the ground. The next few days calls for cold days, and colder nights, but will gradually rebound to more Spring-like towards the end of next week. Until then, hikers hike. A few more bites of my kettle chips and sips of my Hofbrau, and I will work on sleep. Sarah is out, snoring nearby in her bed, Odin curled in a furry ball next to her. Here's to the last bit of warmth for days to come.","Low Gap Shelter

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624645,"Day 05: Unicoe Gap, GA to Deep Gap Shelter, GA - 13.1 miles:
A decent night of sleep at the Helendorf Inn. Despite it still being dark out, my mind was awake at 6am, so I just busied myself online until I finally woke Sarah at 7:30am. We grabbed a quick breakfast - cereal, yogurt, a bagel, and coffee for me - before returning to the room to finish packing and make our way onto the main street of Helen. With it being Sunday, plus the addition of crumby weather overnight, we were planning for a decent walk and wait before we'd find a ride back into the mountains. As we were crossing the street to go snap a few cheesy pictures of the town, a man in a large white truck stopped and asked if we were heading to the trail. Just like that we were heading back to Unicoe Gap with a man named Kit and his two friendly dogs. Over the course of the windy road, Odin laid down by my feet in the backseat, gripping my shoes with his paws.
Kit is a veteran and now retired from the personal protection line of work. He lives in an Airstream trailer at the base of a small mountain, complete with some land - his dream. His outlook on life was refreshing and it was a joy chatting with him during our 20-minute return to the trail head. Waiting at the trail head were a dozen or so hikers looking to get into either Helen or Hiawasee. Kit simply unloaded us, told half a dozen or so to climb in, and he was zipping back down the mountain. He really helped what could've been a time-consuming event, and I'm truly grateful.
By 10am, the three of us were climbing out of Unicoe Gap and into the snow-covered mountains above. With fog hugging the peaks, the day would ultimately be a head-down-and-go kinda day. With no views to be had, plus the biting cold that would set in if stagnant too long, go is what we did. A foot-wide path of mud was the only thing to ruin the scenic hike through the snow-covered slopes, the trees bent over under the weight. As we walked, the sound of crunching snow filled the otherwise still mountains - life put on pause overnight. We soon passed the Cheese(cake) Factory where I first got to know the likes of General Burnsides and Moosehead. The fallen snow made the site appear smaller than I remember, and much more somber as well.
As we approached Tray Gap, several figures began to appear from the depths of the fog. I first noticed some locals, standing around a mud-covered Jeep, accessing what under the hood needed repairing after being damaged during a mud run minutes before. I then noticed an older gentleman, Lion Hearted, standing by the bed of his truck. In the back he had a variety of snacks, handkerchiefs, and drinks. However, we'd heard about him nearly an hour before, as good things spread quickly along the trail, and knew he was offering hot chocolate and coffee. With hands close to freezing, Sarah and I eagerly accepted our steaming cups of hot chocolate, quickly relishing the taste as it sank slowly into our cores, heating us from within. After a much briefer stay than we would've preferred, Sarah, Odin, and me had miles to cover so had to get going. We said our thanks and crossed the dirt road junction, now nothing more than deep pools of mud the color of the hot chocolate we had just enjoyed.
We quickly began climbing the south side of Tray Mountain. With no views to be had at the top, we had nothing to look forwards to and instead chatted and entertained one another to help pass the climb. Odin also helped pull his load on the day. After sleeping for around 15 hours, he was both well-rested and a fan of the snow. He spent the day running up and down the trail and zigzagging among the brush lining the sides, his nose always buried just under the snow. As Sarah lead the way, both of us listening to our respective music, I passed the time by watching Odin and his antics: digging holes in the trail, popping his head out of the snow, a bit resting on the end of his black nose, and his coming and going between Sarah and I when we walked at a distance.
Passing by Swag of the Bluegrass and Sassafras Gap, we finally reached Addis Gap - the spot of the epic Easter trail magic feast of two years ago. Today, there were no colorful signs advertising bacon or any other form of deliciousness. Instead, only a lonely snow-covered gravel road leading down half a mile into a gap where only memories remain. The final leg of the day consisted of a climb up and over Kelly Knob and down into Deep Gap. I remember Kelly Knob not getting the credit she deserves, but I'm pretty sure she reminds each hiker that crosses over. The last time I did it was after two hours of stuffing myself with endless amounts of food and, after a few beers, was nearly drunk in the process. Today, however, was a sober reminder that she's a tough little climb in any circumstance. We strolled into the Deep Gap Shelter where we met several hikers we've seen at camps over the past couple days. Tents were set up, food was enjoyed in a communal style, a trip to the privy was executed safely and with no mishaps, and socializing was had by all.
As the evening approached and the final hikers strolled in, the total number topped out at close to 40 hikers here which is insane. I chatted with a few cool people a while, but then kinda drifted back and enjoyed from afar - grabbing some pictures, watching different groups interact, and the overall performance that is camp life. Watching people both meet for the first time and reconnect after a couple days apart never gets old. It's a community out here unlike any other. One, for now anyways, I'm happy to have been welcomed back into. With cold temps setting in tonight and over the next several days, tomorrow will be a short few miles into the Top of Georgia Hostel as a way to be sluggish and be indoors for at least one of those nights. After that, North Carolina awaits.","Unicoe Gap

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624646,"Day 06: Deep Gap, GA to Dick's Creek Gap, GA - 3.4 miles:
The fifth night brought temps in the low-20's. Needless to say, no sleep was had as I shifted all night like a plump grub in my sleeping bag. Having pitched my tent beneath the bear lines, I found it a a nice welcome when the earliest of risers began lowering their bags, losing the battle of trying to remain quiet in the process. I also found humor in the fact that most of the ~40 hikers went through with the extra chore of hanging their bags while I used mine to comfortably prop my legs on overnight. The cold air bit as soon as I emerged from my tent. The mud from yesterday's section frozen to my shoes; the laces frozen vertically at attention. Cramming my feet into them, I knew it was only a little time til my body heat would thaw them out. After a few minutes of warming my hands around a small fire built by a group of college students from Iowa, it was time to cover the few miles down into Dick's Creek Gap.
The day would only be a short walk, less than 3.5 miles, but consisted of first climbing over a couple smaller climbs before dropping down into warmer temps in the valley below protected from the winds. Along the ridge the wind howled, forcing me to pull my balaclava over my face, my warm breath causing light ice to form along my mustache. The snow and trail had frozen overnight, making the going easier than the sloppy conditions of the day before which, at one point, had caused me to go turtle-up after both feet slipped from under me. The path was covered in tiny fractured pieces of snow and ice, giving the appearance of millions of toenails scattered along the trail.
As the trail descended lower, the snow all but disappeared and the trail returned to easy going. We reached the hardtop of Dick's Creek Gap and made our way half a mile west to the sharp incline leading to the friendly confines of the Top of Georgia Hiking Center operated by triple crowner, Sir Packs Alot, and an assortment of staff and volunteers. At 10:30am, the place was bustling with activity as the days new hikers arrived, and the previous night's were setting out. After a brief introduction and handing over $25/ea - which includes a bunk, shower, and shuttle into Hiawasee - Sarah, Odin, and me were taken into the section of the hostel referred to as the Wolf Den. The small room housed eight bunks where outcasts, misfits, and hikers with dogs are sent. Another unit holds two dozen or so more next door where everyone has access to a small kitchen and bathroom. After nesting out our gear in our respective bunks, grabbing a shower, relaxing in nurse scrubs which are provided, and having my laundry cleaned and returned to me, we caught a 1pm shuttle down into Hiawasee. Having just resupplied in Helen with enough food to reach Franklin, NC, my goal was just to grab a bite to eat.
After being released at the rendezvous point of an Ingles supermarket, the dozen or so of us in the shuttle scattered in all directions, determined to accomplish his or her series of chores, the order of importance differing as much as each hiker. Some headed east to an all-you-can-eat buffet, and others west to a couple of local outfitters and fast-food chains. Per Odin's request, Sarah and I made our way to a Subway, making brief stops at two small outfitters. Sarah purchased a new sleeping pad and I purchased shoe adhesive for when my shoes, without fail, will one day begin to fall apart. We reached Subway where we camped out in a booth for two hours, Odin calmly napping on the floor. Sarah and I came up with the idea of playing Odin off as a service dog (with no disrespect to those who actually benefit from them) which fortunately allowed him to hang out in Subway and venture through Ingles without any issues. As a well-trained dog, all he needs is the occasional snack to keep him happy, and no one will question his obedience.
On our way back to Ingles, I saw Sir Packs Alot pushing a grocery cart down the sidewalk between Ingles and an auto shop. One of the hostel shuttles was having wheels replaced, and he was working on a large restock of goods for the hostel. I broke off from Sarah and Odin to give him a hand. With us being unable to access the van for some time still, we instead chatted for 10 minutes about the hostel and the trail. Every hiker has their own opinion about anything and everything trail-related. I was left indifferent about this hostel during it's first year of operation during my 2015 hike, but this time around it has grown on me.
After returning to the hostel just after 4:30pm, the rest of the evening would consist of lounging around, chatting with other hikers, and overall avoiding the cold outside. All hostels have their own unique atmosphere and character, but both provide the opportunity for hikers to meet and reconnect. My bunk-room alone has a cast of unique characters: a younger guy from Alaska, Iceberg, can jam on a guitar, and his service dog. Two older gentlemen, cousins, from Maine. A mother, Courageous, along with her two sons, aged eight and 10. Along with being a mother of five kids, trekking the AT with two of them, she's also in the process of recovering from a rare cancer of the blood. With the help of a variety of meds, she said she's feeling great, a complete 180 from this time last year, and is in overall great spirits. A great example of a powerful woman. There's also Shades and Lioness who I've flip-flopped with a couple times so far. Shades seems to always being wearing his sunglasses which leads to his name. Lioness is 18 and fresh out of high school. She has a head running wild with dreads, a glimpse of the free spirit I'm sure rests inside. She's using he AT as a ""gap year"" in order to hopefully find direction before she enters college this Fall.
As the evening closed to an end, I drifted in and out of the larger bunk-room, observing hikers busy in their own ways: Shades playing Monopoly on the floor with the two kids and another hiker, a couple other hikers using the kitchen to cook massive meals with food purchased in town, another creating a makeshift wind-block for her stove, and finally another helping an older lady with a gear shakedown. The older woman is the hold-on-to-everything type and, I believe, is a first time hiker. She has been hiking with paper files so far - one paper telling her how to use her stove, another how to set up her tent, for example.
Lights were off at 9pm and, within minutes, the first snorer sounded off. Within another 10 minutes, Sarah began her nightly soundtrack. At some point in the night the small room reached its climax when Courageous, though more subtle, joined in. Nights like last night, when a small room prevents a light breeze from taking away a small percentage of the sound, I sit there suffering through an internal battle. Should I jab my eyes out or should I simply quit the trail? Snorers might be the end of me. Tomorrow brings a last-minute zero in order to avoid a night of cold. The day will be utilized lounging, probably bring bored, socializing with other hikers with the same idea, and hopefully being able to upload the remainder of my photos so far. Back on trail by Wednesday to suffer through what's expected to be the coldest of the nights to come.","Deep Gap Shelter

Today would be a red-eyed kinda day. After another sleepless night, tossing and turning, and listening to music in an attempt to drain out the noise of multiple snorers. Again, I was happy when 7am rolled around, knowing I could get up and return to the main lobby area to have some cereal and coffee. Sitting at the picnic-like tables in the lobby, I enjoyed a bowl of honey oats, complimented with a hot coffee, while Sir Packs Alot gave his morning speech of his 10 golden rules of hiking the AT. Like any self-help book or bit of advice, everyone has their own opinion. His was generally accurate and applied to what the overall new hiker will one day experience in their months of hiking ahead. One point I found particularly interesting, while pointing at a hand-painted map of the AT on a nearby wall, he showed the point where 50% of the class of 2016 thru-hikers quit, close to 1,500 people. It was 1/8th into the trail at ~300 miles.
In what would be a slow, quiet morning in the lobby, I was able to spend close to two hours on the computer uploading my pics on the slowest computer ever. Happy to have that out of the way, the next couple of hours consisted of more lounging around and socializing with fellow hikers. At 1pm, Sarah, Odin and me climbed back into the shuttle to return down the mountains onto Hiawassee. On the way down I chatted with Tumbleweed who is hiking with his sister Moxie. Tumbleweed is from Hutchinson, KS and is very familiar with a nearby town I use to call home a little over a decade ago. With no chores to do, we simply chose to go in as a way to get out of the hostel. In reality, we did nothing more in town than more sitting, this time at McDonald's. We also dropped into a thrift store and outfitter, but nothing was needed, nor purchased. The main street through town was reduced into a one-lane road for a section due to a vehicle that was nearly wrapped around an electric pole. No one seemed to be injured, but we couldn't come up with a possible scenario as to how the truck ended up wrapped around at such an angle.
After downing a chicken sandwich, large fries, and a couple Coke's at the golden arches, we made our way back to the Ingles supermarket where we sat at a row of tables near the front of the store. The shuttle returned at 4:20pm sharp, and we we're soon on our way back into the mountains. As we headed back up, the mountains gradually rose around us, the top third of the highest peaks still capped in snow.
It's now mid-evening and I'm enjoying the last few minutes of the lobby being open, relaxing on a couch among other hikers chatting, catching up online, or, like Sarah, reading nearby. Ropeburn is discussing the deliciousness of raw milk and living as close to off-the-grid as possible with Tumbleweed and Moxie.A soft fire crackles, filling the room with the faint smell of burning wood. Tomorrow brings another cold day and even colder night. With temps expected to drop close to the single digits, tomorrow night will make tonight seem like a lifetime ago.
The goal tomorrow is to at least reach Muskrat Creek Shelter, only ~11 miles away, but we may shoot for Standing Indian Shelter, closer to ~16 miles if our legs rebound nicely from being off them for nearly two days. With another round of weather setting in Friday night, the goal is to reach Franklin, NC in order to avoid it. It's felt a bit slower than anticipated due to the slow-up for weather, but tomorrow brings North Carolina and into the mountains beyond.","Dick's Creek Gap (Top of Georgia Hiking Center)

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624648,"Day 08: Dick's Creek Gap, GA to Deep Gap, NC - 15.8 miles:
Last night brought no sleep again. The hostel messed up by overbooking two hikers, thus Sarah (now known as Toepick) and I had to double on bunk. This put me inches away from her snoring instead of what has been several feet, divided by the thin mesh of our tents. With no way to drain out the noise, I put in my iPod and listened to an audio book, Hatchet, that randomly made it on during my music addition before beginning the trail. I would later finish the book during the early morning of today's hike. Up at 7am, I returned to the lobby for another quick bowl of cereal and couple cups of coffee. With the outside temps only in the upper-teens, Sir Packs Alot shared with the hikers that he coldest temp at the hostel to date was on May 1, 2015 when temps hit -26 degrees. Already two months into my hike that year, somewhere in Virginia at the time, I must've been fortunate enough to have missed out on it. After a few goodbyes with hikers I'd befriended over he past nearly two days, I finished repacking my gear, purchased some earplugs (which tonight will be the fort trial run), and jumped on the shuttle form the quick lift back to Dick's Creek Gap.
By 9:15am, Sir Packs Alot dropped off the ~10 of us hikers, and returned to the hostel down the road, leaving us standing in the parking lot shivering in the cold, knowing the only thing we could do to warm up was to walk back into the snow-capped mountains above. The morning miles passed by quickly and were actually quite beautiful despite the frigid wind blowing up and over the ridges we were crossing. The sky was a deep blue and the sun shown brightly in a sky void of clouds. The contrast between the sparkling white snow we made our way over and through against the blue of the sky was the best we could've hoped for in a day where the temps wouldn't break out of the 20's. The rhododendrons hung shriveled in clumps, the weight of the snow-turned-ice weighing them down. The trail was packed down and hardened by the handful of brave hikers that had broken the trail over the past couple days, giving the appearance that someone had pulled a sled through the fresh snow, leaving a small impression behind.
Toepick, Odin and me stopped for an early lunch in a small clearing of sunlight, hidden from the wind, and were joined by Shades who had the same idea. We had just passed over a small mountain to the south that still showed the scorched scars of fires that swept the area during the 2016 hiking season. The flames had been relatively small, only blackening the lowest foot of the rhododendrons and small trees in the area. After our quick break, we returned to moving in order to thaw out our quickly freezing extremities. Moments later we passed a NoBo hiker Shades knew who was heading south. We asked him what he was doing and he said he was backtracking ~11 miles from Muskrat Creek Shelter to Dick's Creek Gap because last night he'd almost frozen and didn't want to do it again. We were heading about ~5 miles past that point, and tonight will be the coldest night, with lows expected to topple into the single digits.
We reached the GA/NC border after ~9 miles into the day, marked simply by a small piece of wood nailed to a tree, next to a random piece of pipe that the tree has grown around and become part of over what I assume has been many years. As we were leaving the spot, I heard a hike arriving at the spot just before I rounded a corner and was out of view. I returned to meet and help Wild Thing, an Englishman, get a picture of his first milestone. A few miles later we reached Muskrat Creek Shelter where Tumbleweed, Moxie, and Shades were each planning to stay for the night. With it being only 3pm, Toepick and I decided to put in a few more miles since all there was to do otherwise would be to fight off the cold.
A few hundred yards after leaving the shelter, the snow on and along the trail became deep, 4-6 inches, and closer to a foot deep in areas where drift had formed. I feel bad for the hikers who would've had to break the trail in gear not equipped for doing so, but I remain thankful for them, insuring our time wasn't drastically slowed in the process. My trekking poles sunk in a third of the way in some spots and, poor Odin, despite enjoying the heck out of the snow, found himself post-holing for a decent little stretch. It definitely made for an enjoyable hike - something I didn't experience a couple of years ago. The temperatures should gradually rebound starting with a balmy ~40 degrees tomorrow, so the snow should work its way off in a matter of days. A couple of views overlooked green pastures and farms a couple thousand feet below, bathed in what appeared to be warm sunlight, making me feel like I was in another completely different world.
Toepick, Odin and me finally reached a gap in the shadow of the 5,000+ foot Standing Indian Mountain, a mile away from Standing Indian Shelter, but decided to pull up short and bank on the gap having less wind than the shelter a couple hundred vertical feet above. We strolled into a camping ever just west of the gap, already with four tents and their occupants closed in for the day in order to avoid the cold as best they could. It was only 4:45pm. We reconnected with Ewin and Malcolm, two cool Scottish guys we've flip-flopped with over the past several days. They're shooting to take their first zero in Franklin, NC and are excited the day they plan to reach there will be St. Patty's Day. They were sharing a tent since they figured the temps tonight will be too cold to endure without the extra heat.
Toepick and I have decided the same thing since we both failed to stay warm a couple times already when temps were only in the upper-20's. I set up my tent where Odin is comfortably calling home for the night. Toepick and I are wearing everything we have and I, as I wrap up this journal just before 9pm, can tell it will have not made a difference. My fingers are closing in on being numb during the half hour it's taken me to conclude this update. Toepick is already snoring next to me so let's hope my earplugs work. The next ~10 hours will be no joke as the temps continue to quickly drop. I only managed to grab a few pictures today because the cold killed my fully-charged camera battery within the first couple hours of hiking. As a precaution, I've stuffed my phone, iPod, camera, and eventually my tablet into the bottom of my sleeping bag in hopes my body heat will keep them from experiencing potential death by cold.
Stay warm, and here's to hoping the sun's warmth returns soon enough.","Dick's Creek Gap (Top of Georgia Hiking Center)

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624649,"Day 09: Deep Gap, NC to Long Branch Shelter, NC - 17.2 miles:
A miserable night last night. Doubling up in a tent did nothing in battling the cold. Toepick was able to sleep through most of the night, as was evident by her snoring, and so did Odin in my tent next door. I, on the other hand, tossed and turned between every position possible in a mummy sleeping bag, but was unable to find warmth. Around 4am I noticed my toes were numb, but there was nothing I could do about it except wait til movement in the morning. The morning was ridiculously cold, having to climb out of what little warmth my sleeping bag provided, and out into the cold to begin packing up gear. Even Odin was reduced to a curled-up ball on Toepick's sleeping pad as we packed our gear. We watched as the sunlight ever so slowly worked its way down the mountain behind us, but it never quite reached us in the deep gap we had camped in just below the 5,000+ foot Standing Indian Mountain to our east. Wearing everything I had, plus two pairs of socks on my hands, we set off to begin our ascent up Standing Indian Mountain.
Fortunately it was well-graded and the climb went smoothly until we reached the summit, offering a scenic view back towards the south, part of Hiawasee just visible beyond a far mountain. After snapping a few pictures, we continued on since the frigid air bit through our layers, despite another perfectly clear day. The day consisted of a steady rotation between walking over the ice-hardened shoe prints of other hikers, pushing our way through areas of snow drift, skating over frozen sections of trail where water normally crossed, and slipping our way along muddy sections. Depending what side of each mountain we found ourselves on, the trail condition could change in moments.
We took our first break and had lunch at Carter Gap Shelter. Positioned in an area with little wind, it was refreshing to finally feel the warmth of the sun for the first time in the past few days. I took a quick trip to the privy, taking pride in the fact that I didn't cause the ever-growing pile of excrement, gradually growing upwards towards the toilet seat, to topple over. I instead landed my addition carefully on top, topping it off with a little piece of toilet paper - a flag, if you will. With it already being 1:30pm, we weren't able to break long and soon returned to the trail, determined to give ourselves the option of reaching Long Branch Shelter, still ~10 miles away. After leaving Carter Gap, the trail meandered through several miles of mountainsides burnt from last year's fires, the blackened remains of trees standing out in stark contrast against the white snow. The twisting, outreached remains of rhododendron branches remained, but were void of their green leaves. Around another couple bends in the trail, these same rhododendrons, untouched by fire, grew with the grade of the mountains, standing at 45-degree angles to the trail, reaching over and forming tunnels that we passed under. The never-ending battle of finding their own little spot in the sun.
Aside from the trail conditions determined on slowing our progress, we were able to still make good time, arriving at Betty Creek Campsite in what seemed no time at all. Wild Thing was posted up for the evening and, after briefly chatting with him, continued on. We only had ~5 miles to cover, but three of those miles consisted of a climb up and over Mt. Albert, before a gradual decline would lead us to our goal for the day. The climb up Mt. Albert was steady, the trail gradually winding its way up and around towards the summit. With the mountain rising a few hundred vertical feet just to our left, and dropping off just as much to our right, we had to take our time crossing ice-covered patches along the way. As we climbed higher and the trail became steeper, we broke off pieces of foot-long icicles and sucked on them for water, too stubborn to stop and drink from the half-frozen bottles in our packs.
After a final steep push over the final quarter mile, we finally reached the fire tower that not only marked the summit of Mt. Albert, but also the 100-mile mark of the AT. Being only 4:30pm, we knew we had plenty of time to cover the remaining ~2.5 miles so we let ourselves enjoy a break, enjoying the beautiful 360-degree view from atop the tower, before the cold finally set in and forced us to get moving. Just over a mile later we encountered our first SoBo hikers, Rabbit, Happy Pants, and Duchess, nearing the 100 miles remaining point of their journey, which had started in August of 2016. Having already experienced what they're closing in on, I'm sure they're feeling the bitter sweetness of it all. We congratulated and wished them well before we finished our last leg into camp.
This shelter is nestled on a ridge just off the trail, which unfortunately means another frigid morning tomorrow seeing as though we'll be on the west side of the mountain. Seven hikers are calling this shelter home for the night - four downstairs, and three on an upstairs loft. After chatting and joking together during dinner, we all quickly got into our sleeping bags as the last light of the day began to fade, bringing with it the coldness of the night. Toepick and I are lying in an L-shape in one of the bottom corners, Odin sleeping snugly in the space between us and the corner of the shelter. Although it'll be another cold night, we have the assurance this time of our gear remaining dry and not freezing.
Tonight will drop into the low-20's, but should rebound to be another decent day tomorrow as the weather gradually improves. The goal is to do ~10 miles into Franklin, NC and stay in a cheap motel for the night since the forecast calls for rain. I'm looking forwards to taking a warm shower and thawing from the inside out in what has been a difficult stretch of cold weather. The Smokies loom in ~50 miles so this will also be the last real opportunity to enter a town until after completing that section.
Off to sleep for now. Hoping Odin will let me cuddle with him if the night gets too cold again. In nine days since beginning, I've experienced warm 60-degree days, a wild thunderstorm atop Blood Mountain, trekking through foot-deep snowdrifts, and temperatures in the single digits. It's safe to assume a fair amount of hikers that started around the same time may have seen their hikes come to an early end. I wouldn't change it for anything, though, save maybe the cold. Ya, most definitely the cold.","Deep Gap

Despite temps dropping back into the low-20s last night, it ended up being one of my first comfortable nights on the trail. By stuffing my plastic packliner into my sleeping bag, the heat trapped in was enough to keep my legs and feet happy. I wore the remainder of my layers and zipper up my sleeping bag so only my nose and mouth were visible. By putting my electronics in with me, I was able to make sure the cold wouldn't drain any additional battery life. I woke at 6am, but remained zipped in my cocoon until just after 7am when Toepick and Odin joined me. Not wanting to wake the rest of the hikers snoring, we sat quietly talking until the Scottish guys upstairs began moving. I started the morning off by scarfing down the remainder of my snacks devoted as ""breakfast"" material, brushed my teeth, and took a trip to the privy. Odin joined me momentarily, walking in and catching me with my pants around my knees, before strolling away. I capped off the large mountain of crap with my own addition, the consistency that of a Wendy's frosty.
With only 7.2 miles to cover before reaching Winding Stair Gap, Toepick, Odin and me got the trail at 8:45am and, aside from brief water breaks, averaged 3mph, reaching the gap by 11:15am. On the way we passed a trail maintenance crew improving the trail using a variety of tools including shovels, crowbars, and pick axes. We also hiked over a stretch of mountain, just north of Wallace Gap, completely destroyed by last year's fires. Exposed rocks, normally covered in vegetation, dotted the slopes. Other than small patches of snow, the slopes were void of life, and instead replaced by a variety of browns, blacks, and grays. However, nature has a way of forgetting and overcoming hardships, and will surely rebound as Spring approaches.
Reaching Winding Stair Gap at 11:15am, Toepick placed a quick call and had a shuttle on its way almost immediately. Within half an hour an old rickety van pulled up, a ""Budget Inn"" decal in one window. The three of us, plus one other hiker who planned to hike on but only made it ~5 miles before her body told her no and was returning to the motel, climbed in and were soon zipping down the mountains towards town 10 miles away. The driver assured me the hissing of the wind in the passenger door next to me ""makes it sound open, but won't move."" Twenty minutes later we pulled into the unimpressive parking lot surrounded by the L-shape motel itself. We were given a pathetic room with even sadder beds and a poor excuse for a bathroom. After the past couple days of freezing temps, it would make for a great home for the night.
After a quick round of showers, finally able to thaw out our cores, we got busy doing our town chores. With laundry going, we made our way up the sharp hill leading into the downtown and to Outdoor 76, a large outfitter/brewery combo. I was surprised to see the brewery part had expanded over the past two years, now with a full bar, large TV, a shuffleboard, darts, and an area to host live music - a big improvement from the closet-like confines I was expecting to see. I made sure to text General Burnsides and update him of the new setup. Toepick purchased some Crocks, shorts, and a t-shirt before making her way across the street for some frozen yogurt and returning to the motel to collect our laundry. I remained behind and enjoyed two local IPA's. With constantly being dehydrated, I was probably a beer away from stumbling out. After mindlessly passing through a bookstore on the way back to the motel, I met back up with Toepick and we decided on a Mexican restaurant I had visited during my last time in town.
Two baskets of chips and salsa and a large fajita dish later, I had reached my limit. Toepick enjoyed a plate of a variety of burritos, smothered in cheese and other forms of deliciousness. With food babies on board, we momentarily regretted what we had done, knowing we still had to resupply our food and cover the half-mile walk back to the motel. After a quick trip through Dollar General, we both agreed we had gotten too much, but would appreciate it 48 hours from now. We returned to find a much livelier and happy Odin, caught mid-stretch on one of the beds as we walked in, after having napped for the past several hours. The big guy hikes hard, and sleeps even harder.
It's now just after 8pm, our food packs are re-stuffed with crappy goodness, I have a liter of Coke chilling in the fridge, and two soft, pillows beneath my head. Odin is back to sleeping and Toepick has been watching a variety of house hunting shows, occasionally chiming in at the lameness of the people on it. The heat is set on high so no numb toes to worry about tonight. Tomorrow we'll be up at 7am and picked up by a local church that provides a free pancake breakfast for hikers, and eventually return to the trail sometime after. The weather will be returning to the 50's and 60's soon, with lows in the 30's and 40's, a far cry from the past handful of days. Looking forwards to being able to hike in as few articles of clothing as possible again.","Long Branch Shelter

I ended last night watching the last half hour or so of Varsity Blues. A classic. We all know the two words used to describe Coach Kilmer in the final halftime speech. I think I'm going to refer to every mountain as Kilmer from now on. Though I'd toss and turn like usual, I actually enjoyed a decent night's sleep until my alarm sounded at 7am.
At 7:15am sharp, the local First Baptist Church dropped by in a white van, corralled a handful of hungry hikers in, and deposited us at their church doors a few blocks away. Having experienced this process before, I knew what to expect, and enjoyed watching the new hikers being greeted by friendly faces and offered their share of all-you-can-eat pancakes, bacon, strawberries, grapes, coffee, and OJ. We were specifically told that ""If we left hungry, it was our own faults."" Toepick and I sat at a table with some of the hosts and chatted about the trail. They took a picture of us, asked us to write a brief message with it, and will mail it to whoever we chose so a loved one knew we were doing well at the ~110-mile mark. In between downing 5 pancakes and two handfuls of bacon, I was able to find my name on the Class of 2015 banner hanging on a nearby wall. No more than a gut-busting hour later, we were wished well and returned to our motel.
With the first shuttle returning to the trail at 9am, we had no desire to quickly pack, and instead lounged around until 11am digesting our breakfast and mindlessly watching TV. Toepick returned with a go-box stuffed with pancakes, bacon, and hard-boiled eggs for Odin, but we were disappointed when he seemed to be above such a meal. After downing the bacon and a couple small bites of pancakes, the rest would remain sitting on the floor until we threw it away as we were leaving. I'm sure he regrets not having those extra pancakes and eggs now.
After being dropped off at Winding Stair Gap, we had nothing else to do but return upwards into the mountains above. The positive was the highs reached into the 50s and, despite a brisk wind all day, it was rather comfortable. As we climbed ~1,300ft in five miles, the first thing I noticed was the lack of snow. Aside from a few small pockets on the northern slopes of the mountains, the past two days all but erased what we had been pushing through over the past few days. We had returned to a different world once again.
After reaching Snowbird Gap, I remembered being there two years ago with General Burnsides and Moosehead, the three of us running up the steep bald to look for a view that's never come due to the fog. Instead we took a picture that would make a legit album cover, if only any of us could really sing. With blue skies today, I was eager to run back up and see what I had missed out on. As Toepick sunbathed in a patch of grass below, Odin and I were off to the races, quickly making our way up a few hundred feet in the span of ~200 yards. The view from atop Siler Bald was one of the best so far, offering a killer 360-degree view of mountains in all directions. The colors ranged from a darker blue to lighter blue the closer they got to the horizon. It eventually got to a point where it was difficult to determine where the mountains ended and the sky began. I grabbed a few pictures, including a couple of Odin, lying on his tummy looking into the distance, that just might prove animals do enjoy views as humans do.
After sprinting back down the bald into Snowbird Gap, getting completely crushed in my footrace with Odin, Toepick and I ended up lounging in the grass for nearly an hour until gray clouds rolled in, blocking the sun and bringing with it a cold breeze. Using it as a sign to get moving, we were back at it just before 2pm. We only went a few hundred yards when Toepick had to pull off dormant emergency bathroom break. With my legs chomping at the bit, I told her I was going to go at my pace and I'd see her at some point later in the day. I made sure she kept Odin so he wouldn't follow me down the mountain. That'd be the last time I saw them for the day as the terrain became pretty tough, though I managed to average close to 3mph for the remainder of the day.
As I pressed on, my legs pumping like pistons for the first time, I passed eight hikers that had passed us during our lunch break in Snowbird Gap. Once I passed Namaste, a girl who I can tell already puts in higher mileages than some guys at this point, I knew I'd be solo hiking the remainder of the day. When you know the time of day and distance to next shelter(s), it can be easy to know if many, or any, hikers will still be out. I reached Wayah Bald at 3:45pm and, had it not been for the stone tower sitting atop the summit, I would've thought it was a totally different place. Walking down a road that leads to the tower, an avenue of burnt, destroyed trees lined both sides. Where normally trees might obscure views to the valleys below, they were now easy to see through the skeleton-like remnants left behind. I remember enjoying trail magic inside the tower two years ago - hot dogs and fruit, to be exact - now, just a puddle of standing water covers the floor; a spray painting of ""Jesus saves"" adorns one wall. During the same fogged-in day that prevented the views at Siler Bald, I was now able to climb the stone steps and enjoy yet another breathtaking 360-degree view. I was able to see Standing Indian Mountain, where I stood three mornings ago in single digit temps, now 10 miles away as the crow flies. I was able to see a small sliver of Franklin, nestled in the valley several miles away. Towards the northwest, I was able to see the faint outline of the Smokies as they rose into and became part of the clouds above, now only ~40 trail miles away at my current location.
After leaving Wayah Bald, I descended easily just over a mile to Wayah Bald Shelter. With it only being 4:30pm and the shelter and campsites nearly full, I decided to push on. With my legs still pushing me along strongly, I rode the wave until I'd covered five more miles and had reached Cold Spring Shelter. A few older gentlemen already filled the shelter, but were enjoying a large fire as I arrived. I quickly dropped my pack and made my way to the nearby privy. Priorities. I then limped another hundred yards up the trail until I reached a ridge sitting just above the trail. I remember staying here with General Burnsides, Moosehead, Rock Boat, and Tick Tock - all of our friendships still in their infancy stages at the time. Although the wind is rushing up and over the mountain behind me and blowing off into the nothingness of the dropoff ~20ft from my tent, it's worth the chillier night to be able to experience an excellent sunrise tomorrow, if the weather is nice.
I quickly set up my tent, fighting the wind in the process, and crawled in to escape it. A quick dinner of crackers, an oatmeal cream pie, and a stick of jerky, and my day was complete. Tomorrow brings an 11.7-mile day, dominantly downhill into the Nontahala Outdoor Center (NOC), ending with a 2,500ft descent in the final five miles. I hope to make it by early afternoon and then be able to enjoy a relaxing evening by a campsite along some rushing rapids. The next day will be a nearly mirror image of tomorrow, only ascending out of the NOC instead, the first extended climb of the trail. After that, it's only a couple more days until I reach Fontana Dam and the gateway to the Smokies.","Winding Stair Gap

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624652,"Day 12: Cold Spring Shelter, NC to the NOC, NC - 11.7 miles:
Very little sleep again due to the angle of my rain fly to the slope behind my tent. Cold air rushed up and in through the gap between it and my tent, leaving me shivering for most of the night. It may not have been like the cold of last week, but a night spent shivering is as bad as any. I waited as long as I could in the morning for the sun to rise, but also wanted to get moving so I could reach the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) by early afternoon to enjoy lunch and relax before tomorrow's big climb out of the deep gorge cut by the river over millennia. With my hands instantly in pain due to the cold, I worked as quickly as I could, which was slow, to break camp and get to hiking. The sun finally appeared about 10 minutes before I got the trail, but it's take a while to feel it's warmth. Another morning wearing multiple layers, my balaclava, and a beanie.
With just under 12 miles to the NOC, I was familiar with the stretch from my first hike, and knew I could maintain a decent pace. With music in, the morning miles passed quickly, pausing several times to grab pictures, enjoy a summit view atop Rocky Bald, and an observation tower. Though I could've easily wasted away more time enjoying the rolling mountains in the sunshine atop the tower, I knew I was only 4 miles from the NOC, resting in a valley ~2,500 vertical feet below me. For the next mile or so, the trail ran along one of the thinnest ridges on the trail, a buffer zone of only a few feet on either side of the trail before a fall of hundreds of feet. This area, too, had been left scorched from the previous year's fires, and the faint smell of smoke still lingered in the now warming air. The ridge reached its climax at ""the jump-off,"" a rocky point at the end of a ridge, a lone tree sticking out, where the trail takes a sharp turn, nearly 180-degrees before dropping lower.
Covering good time as the thought of a Coke and real food tempted me, the previous morning's breakfast baby acquired at the church in Franklin now a distant memory, I passed by eight hikers who were obviously not as hungry as myself. At 1:30pm, I descended from the final ridge and exited the woods on near an intersection of two roads, the NOC located around the junction. The NOC consists of several buildings, all catering to the outdoor enthusiast, as well as the tourists passing through. A large outfitter with a large selection of anything a hiker or kayaker could want sits to the right. To the left, across from the outfitter is a restaurant, End of the River, which was calling my name. Across the street from the restaurant is a general store, offering a small selection of goods, mainly to passing hikers or motorists, the prices hiked up, of course. It was my first stop, of eventually a couple, to grab a Coke. With it in hand, I went I to the restaurant where I'd kill the next hour putting the roaring lion in my stomach to rest.
I enjoyed an overpriced appetizer and lunch of chips and salsa and a chili-cheese burger and fries, conveniently dubbed the ""Mile Post 134."" The current mileage is closer to 137, though, so, along with lowering the prices of their food, updating the name would be my only other suggestion. The meal was still delicious and satisfying. A couple of TV's were playing the Louisville-Michigan game, but I only took a few glances. Even March Madness, along with any real form of everyday entertainment or social media, takes a backseat when hiking; it's just simply not important. I made my way outside where a handful of other hikers lounged and chatted in the sun. I lost my layered clothes for the first time in days, enjoying the warm sun against my skin. It was nice to see the slight bulges of leg muscles now present.
Within minutes, I noticed a familiar object working its way down the ridge in front of me - Odin. Behind him was Toepick, having crushed it and made 17 miles by 3pm. Odin was happy to see me and came right to me. Toepick played it cool, but she was happy to see me again too. It had only been 24 hours since we split, but the trail has a way of making time seem much longer. I accompanied them both to the general store to grab some snacks, then we lounged in the sun on a picnic table next to the rapids that flow through the NOC. We chatted, watched kayakers navigate the course through the rapids, and overall just relaxed. With a ~6 mile climb out of the gorge tomorrow, resting was the only goal needing accomplished for the remainder of the day.
We both spent a little time in the outfitter, printing our Smokey Mountain thru-hiker permits in the process, while I drank Coke nearly the entire time. Courageous, the mother hiking with two kids, called Toepick from across the river so we went to say hello. Having left the Top of Georgia the day before us, she informed us that both she and one of her sons had been sick and had spent nearly the entire past week off the trail. Now, however, they were feeling good and would be rejoining tomorrow. She invited us to a cabin she was renting and said her family made too much food and we needed to come help take care of it. We agreed. We first walked down along the river to a secluded campsite not listed in the guidebook, and that few hikers know of unless heard by word-of-mouth. I camped here with General Burnsides and Moosehead , and remember falling asleep to the sound of rapids just below the campsite.
After camp was set, we returned to Courageous' cabin with her two sons, a handful of hikers, and eventually a hoard of Wisconsin students spending their spring break biking in the area. As they made a massive feast of spaghetti, we enjoyed a seemingly endless supply of chili, pecan cake, and cookies so graciously offered by Courageous. She ended up giving a ton of it to the college students who, after putting in ~80 miles in the saddle today, had acquired a hunger equal to that of a thru-hiker. We eventually made our way back to camp as the sun began slipping behind the mountain to the west of the gorge. We spent ~20 minutes sitting on a log chatting, Odin asleep in a variety of weird positions behind us, before making our way to our tents.
While Toepick is in her typical setup, I've decided to half-cowboy camp. Using a slight depression in the ground, I simply staked my rain-fly, held up by my trekking poles, and am sleeping in the natural bowl beneath. I like to think it'll save me precious minutes in the morning as we break camp, especially if cold, but Toepick is probably right in that I should've just set up my tent as usual. For now, as I wrap up this journal, the plump pile of leaves I'm bedded down on feels comfortable. Hoping for a restful night.
With this being the last real spot to potentially charge my gadgets for some time, possibly a week or more as I make my way towards, through, and out of the Smokies, I will do my best to conserve what battery life I have. The best way to do so will be to condense my entries a bit. Sorry, guys, no poop details
Thanks to everyone for the ongoing support. As always, it's much appreciated. Time to climb.","Cold Spring Shelter

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624653,"Day 13: The NOC, NC to Brown Fork Gap Shelter, NC - 15.8 miles:
Last night brought a restful night, tucked in the leafy bowl beneath my rain-fly. I woke at 6am, still beneath a blanket of stars, and decided to get up instead of tossing for another hour or more. I quietly packed my things so as not to wake Toepick sleeping inner tent nearby, and headed for a bathroom a few hundred yards away. The air was cold and my rain-fly had frosted over during the night. When I reached the bathroom, I hung my rainfly over a stall door and allowed a small heater near the ceiling work its magic. While it dried, I sat in another stall, confident that no one else in the NOC would be awake to come bother me. I cashed a quick check, the last of the chili cheese burger from yesterday, and then ate some pop tarts while still sitting on the toilet. In normal life, I avoid deucing in public restrooms at all cost, but now the warmth of the bathroom outweighed the grossness of it.
I returned to an outdoor patio bar-like restaurant, still closed until warmer weather settles in, where I stashed my phone to charge overnight. Using a few stacked chairs, I was able to hide it up in the beams of the roof, not having to worry anyone would find it. I swapped it for my tablet, only to find out later the cold negated an hour and a half of charging time, leaving me with less than I would've desired.
Toepick and Odin soon joined me at the bathrooms and we rotated going in and out to take care of our remaining morning chores. I made small chat with a couple railroad workers, as they started up the roaring engines of some kind of railroad vehicle that does who knows what, and were soon rolling east along the tracks. We returned to the riverside at the NOC, the water noticeably more shallow than the previous day, in order to kill half an hour to charge gadgets. I crossed the river to the River's End restaurant, and went in to grab a coffee. Overpriced, of course, but the wonders it'd do in warming me up was worth it.
We eventually began the eight-mile climb that'd take us from 1,771ft to 5,062ft atop Cheoah Bald. The climb was actually not as bad as I remembered, and we were able to maintain a 2.5mph pace. I had to stop every 10-20 minutes to pee due to the coffee and a liter and a half of water intake before getting started, but it provided me mini breaks along the way. After a half-hour lunch atop a peak six miles in, we hit the high point for the day at Cheoah Bald and enjoyed a view, though dreary and under a low ceilings of battleship-gray clouds. Toepick suffered through stiff ""everything"" as she called it and immediately collapsed on her back upon reaching the summit. Soon enough, though, and with 10 miles still to cover, we got moving.
The next several miles of ups and downs weren't particularly demanding, but made harder due to soar ankles from the constant twisting over rocks and roots. Some days will be good, some bad, but it's a soreness that will always remain until hiking has ceased. As the miles rolled on, we grew thirsty and tired, but pushed on. I carried only a half liter of water all day out of stubbornness of not wanting the weight. Odin was able to curb a little of his thirst by eating mouthfuls of snow in the very few remaining patches that appeared throughout the day.
We reached Stechoa Gap at 4:45pm, the site of an epic trail magic feast two years ago. I longed for it to be waiting there for me again all day, but it wouldn't be this time around. We sat at empty picnic tables for 45min, procrastinating over the climb we knew was just ahead - Jacob's Ladder. Having ate my weight in food just before taking it on a couple years ago, I remember it going on forever as I tried not to throw up my food on the way up. Without any food in me this time, I was hopeful it wouldn't be as bad the second time around. As we rounded a small mountain and began dropping towards a small gap, a 600ft wall grew steadily ahead of us. As we got to its base, all that was visible was a series of tight switchbacks rising high to the point of becoming a singularity. Up it is. After a minute into the climb, Toepick allowed me to pass and climb at my own pace, Odin coming with me to wait at the peak. Within 10 minutes of hard climbing, some stretches at 45-degree angles, and with Odin's hot breath on the back of my legs during the entire climb, we finally crested the top. I waited a couple minutes, but decided to move on to the shelter nearby, mainly because Odin was thirsty and I had no water for either of us.
During the gradual descent towards the shelter, I misread a wooden sign, confusing the direction of the shelter as .1 miles north instead of ahead of me, off the trail. Onward we went, and on, and on, before I finally decided I had missed it. Returning back towards the sign, now a mere slug working my way back uphill, I reached the sign and discovered my mistake. I felt bad for Odin who had trustingly followed along, and soon found myself feeling bad for Toepick who had returned back down the trail looking for us, assuming we were waiting somewhere or had fallen off the side of a mountain. I quickly got my phone and called her to update her of my mistake. She was understandably upset upon returning, but eventually realized it was a simple mistake and that I wouldn't let anything happen to Odin. It's a privilege to know Odin has accepted me into his former one-man wolf pack, now having grown by one, and that he feels comfortable taking off with me ahead of Toepick at times.
Within a half-hour of reaching the shelter, I had eaten, brushed my teeth, and got horizontal in order to journal and try to get some rest. My aching ankles definitely need it. Tonight and tomorrow call for rain, but fortunately we're in a shelter and can avoid having our tents soaked. If the rain holds off long enough tomorrow, we may be able to beat it to Fontana Lake, now only 12.8 miles away.
The shelter is full with five hikers, and another three are camped nearby. An older gentleman who's been sleeping since I arrived at 6:30pm is already snoring, promising what'll most likely be sleepless night ahead. For now, being off my feet is what's important. This'll have to do.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), NC

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624654,"Day 14: Brown Fork Gap Shelter, NC to Fontana Lake, NC - 10.6 miles:
I woke at some point last night to the feeling of a tongue rolling across my forehead. Still somewhere trapped in sleep, my initial thought was what the heck is Toepick doing? When I came to enough, I realized it was just Odin, giving me a little love after returning from a midnight trip to the bathroom.
A few hours later, I tossed as the earliest of risers began packing up and hitting the trail, over an hour and a half before sunrise. The next thing I knew I woke to my watch already reading 7:30am. Dammit. Toepick was already awake, but still lying in her sleeping bag. We managed to quickly get to our morning chores, downing poptarts for breakfast, brushing teeth, checking out the local privy, and packing up. We were hiking by 8:45am, the goal of reaching Fontana Lake, only ~12 miles away. When looking at an elevation profile of the AT, one golden rule to remember is this: not all ups have a down, but almost all downs have an up. The morning would pass along simply enough, climbing where the guide showed downs, simply enjoying music and hiking in silence.
Toepick suffered through another day of stiff muscles and sore feet, earning her trail name in the process, as she tripped, stumbled, and fell several times throughout the day. The sun eventually appeared in the early afternoon, just in time for our climb of ~700ft to the top of a ridge that would eventually lead us into Fontana Lake. With the temps only in the 60s, Toepick complained that she was struggling, and Odin obviously was as he walked slowly, rested often, and his tongue dangled from his mouth all day. I, being from the South, barely broke a sweat and appreciated the weather - a far cry from the extreme cold of a week ago.
As we crested the ridge, Fontana Lake came into view a couple thousand vertical feet below us. It's dark blue waters stood out against the otherwise brown and grey backdrop of trees yet to change into their finest colors. One thing was obvious, the water level was very low. Running around the edge of the lake was a brown strip of exposed land, typically hidden beneath the water, that seemed to be nearly ~20ft in length. A few boats dotted the lake, but otherwise remained silent and empty, still a month or more away from the busy season. We meandered along the ridge for what seemed forever, wondering if the trail would ever begin heading down. The Smokies rose high to the north, even Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the trail, made a couple appearances in the distance as we danced through the trees.
Eventually the trail did cut down, but it took just shy of two hours to finally exit the woods at a parking lot near a boat launch. A restroom stood off to the right, a couple signs advertising using a phone on a wall to call for a shuttle, simply by dialing zero. I instantly hailed a shuttle into Fontana Village, a large touristy, summer camp-like compound that sits eerily empty at this time of year. I then spent $1.25 for a can of Coke that normally I'd scoff at in the real world. However, the light burning of the carbonation down my throat was too much to resist. The shuttle arrived soon after and we were whisked away the three miles into Fontana Village and deposited at the Fontana Resort. Toepick had to pick up a package, and I went hunting for power outlets. With no luck on my end, we soon returned outside in order to catch the shuttle down a hill a couple hundred yards to the general store.
After combing the isles through the limited selection, though everything a hiker could want, I emptied my modest resupply onto the counter as the beep, beep, beep of the barcodes being scanned filled the air. With an old school computer system, it didn't show you the price of each item, leaving me sweating as I waited in anticipation. When the clerk said $51, a little part of me died inside. It was the most I'd ever dropped on such crap - some candy bars, spam, chips, two cokes - just enough junk to get me through the Smokies. I went outside and joined a handful of other hikers wasting away the afternoon on the porch, snacking, drinking beer, and charging their electronics. Toepick and Odin would join, and we'd spent nearly two hours there ourselves.
As we chatted and drifted into food comas, an unfortunate event happened for one hiker, a Boston native named Scout. He received a phone call from family telling him his grandfather had died. He was visibly upset for a while, and the few hikers around did their best to keep him positive. Toepick has decided not to go through the Smokies, and instead will be renting a car for five days to provide some trail magic at Newfound Gap. She offered to drive Scout all the way to nearly Washington DC so that he could then make his way to his grandfather's funeral in Boston. He graciously accepted. We then made a last-minute decision to stay in a nearby B&B/hostel for the night. Although I didn't need it, the draw of a shower, laundry, and ability to fully charge my gear was enough for me to agree. Although the B&B/hostel was only five minutes away in a straight line, it took nearly half an hour to reach it due to having to drive around a series of mountains we had trekked over earlier in the day. The B&B/hostel was even located within three miles of a road crossing Toepick and I had stopped at around noon to enjoy a little trail magic. Someone had left a Gatorade and Mellow Yellow sitting on a sign near the trail head, and we were fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time.
As we zipped around hairpin turns winding their way through green valleys, I couldn't help but watch out the window at all the photo opportunities in this place lost in time. Old barns seemingly held up by splinters, cows and donkeys, a drum barrel standing just off the road with a sign reading ""boiled peanuts"" nailed above, and old tractors to name a few. Our host, Cynthia, and her husband, Jeff, moved into the home a few years ago after retiring after having grown up in Canada. Cynthia is a retired veterinarian and their home has four or five hounds running around, seemingly multiplying each time I rounded a corner as I strolled the grounds grabbing pictures. Jeff seems to be a bit of a carpenter and stood working outside with a table saw, the sound of the blades slicing through wood drifting up through our upstairs window.
Toepick, Scout, Odin, and me are sharing an upstairs room with three beds and a shower. We all took turns showering, I'm adorned in a soft robe as my few clothes finish in the laundry, my food has been distributed and calculated for the week ahead, and I'm enjoying a Catawba Firewater IPA offered to me by Scout. The mountains are alive with the sound of rolling thunder outside as a storm rolls through, the lights occasionally flickering off after a lightning strike. Tonight we stay dry and clean, before that is all ruined tomorrow as I head off into the Smokies. Toepick plans to do me a huge solid by delivering half of my food to Newfound Gap on Friday, reducing my food weight by half. With tomorrow bringing a ~16 mile day, all of it climbing up into the Smokies, the lack of weight will be greatly appreciated.
It's currently 9pm and Toepick just returned with the laundry. I guess it's time I get back into my own clothes so I don't keep dirty grandpa'ing it. Tomorrow I climb, and climb, and climb.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624655,"Day 15: Fontana Dam, NC to Spence Field Shelter, NC - 18.5 miles:
Last night I fell asleep to the sound of rain, and the occasional clap of thunder. I scored a mini fan in a closet next to my bed, something that has always helped me sleep, and sleep I did. I would wake many times throughout the night, but fall asleep almost immediately each time. Toepick, Scout, Odin, and me soon made our way downstairs to a breakfast spread we weren't expecting. On a table before us were six varieties of cereal, milk, OJ, coffee, mixed fruit, yogurt, cornbread, banana nut bread, three varieties of local honey, four varieties of jam, bagels, and lox. I tried a little of everything, save the bread, in order to enjoy more of the other delicacies.
After stuffing myself to the brim, knowing I'd be hungry again in an hour, we finished packing our gear and were soon shuttled back towards Fontana. With Toepick renting a car for the next several days, including taking Scout to northern Virginia today, I would be the first dropped off, back at the marina with the restrooms where we ended the day before. I said bye to Scout, have Toepick a hug, and Odin a kiss on the head. I'm sure he'll miss me as much as I'll miss him while passing through the Smokies. I also thanked Jeff for his hospitality before he returned to his car to take the others into Fontana Village where they would hang out until Enterprise picked them up around noon.
After a quick deuce in the restroom, my second of the morning, I put in my music to begin the long day I knew awaited. By now it was already 9:45am; I hoped my legs would kick into gear quickly because the Smokies rose up above the surrounding terrain in around two miles. I made a quick stop at the Fontana Hilton to grab a couple pictures of views I didn't have a couple years ago. I passed the restroom where General Burnsides, Moosehead, Tick Tock, and me spent what seemed like hours talking and joking with one another during my original hike. Moosehead and I had even helped shave one another's neck hair so we'd look fresh for the Smokies. No such luxury this time around. Minutes later I was making my way across the Fontana Dam - the blue water to my right, now a greenish brown upclose, and the dam dropping hundreds of feet to my left. A few vehicles sat at it's base, appearing like colorful ants from my vantage point above. I took turns zigzagging across the top of the dam, enjoying the drastically different views offered on each side.
After a few minutes up a side road leading up into the woods, I finally reached the little metal bin where I was to insert the permit I purchased back to the NOC. The permits help with keeping track of attendance, as well as monitoring who's in the backcountry for safety reasons. AT hikers are required to carry a copy of their permit with them at all times in case a ranger asks to see it, as well as eventually leave it in another metal bin once reaching the northern boundary of the park. Thru-hikers are given eight days to pass through the 70-mile stretch of trail, but for most it's not an issue. I'm planning to more or less mirror my '15 hike through the Smokies, exiting at some point on the fifth day.
With my head down and music going, I entered a zone, riding the wave of feeling good for as long as it'd carry me. At noon, I went up a side trail, thinking it was the AT, and found myself standing below Shuckstack fire tower, standing around 100ft high atop Shuckstack Mountain. Happy that my tunnel vision led me here, I climbed the steep staircase, instantly freezing as the cold wind hit me once I was above treeline. Fortunately the top was enclosed in sheet metal and glass windows, a gradual ""fwap fwap"" as the wind shook the loose pieces of metal around me. To the north I could see the blue hue of the Smokies rising before me, their tops hidden behind a small blanket of white clouds. To the south, now in a valley far below, parts of Fontana Lake glistened in the sun. I could even see parts of Fontana Village, knowing that, if Enterprise was on time, Toepick, Odin, Scout, and a third hiker would now be crowding into a vehicle with some poor Enterprise employee. Seeing that Toepick and Scout at least enjoyed showers last night, it could've been worse. Just before I continued on, I enjoyed another bagel and lox I had wrapped in my pack and carried from Creekside Paradise on the AT this morning.
Two hours of climbing later, I reached Mollies Ridge Shelter. Eight hikers were already bedding down for the day at 2:30pm. This wasn't an option for me and, after a brief 30-second break, pushed on. Continuing to climb for another three miles, I'd reach Russell Field Shelter at 3:30pm. With the constant flux between sweating and then freezing once the cold air hit my wet body, I ducked into the shelter to escape the wind for a bit. I quickly downed a pack of M&M's, a Snickers, a Twix, and a Kit-Kat in front of me few day-hikers who appeared to be in their teens. The smell of pot lingered in the still air of the shelter, and it was obvious I was cramping their style. Within 15 minutes I was back on the trail, determined to reach Spence Field Shelter before calling it a day. Just under an hour later, I had covered another three miles, and it was only 4:30pm. Though I've preferred to utilize the daylight so far, today I was happy with shutting it down early. Having covered 18.5 miles up into the Smokies in seven hours, there's a fine line between pushing too hard and enjoying an accomplishment. I chose the latter.
I quickly down a dinner of spam, tuna, pepperoni, and a slice of cheese, brushed my teeth, and have since been horizontal for the past hour. Since leaving Fontana Lake this morning, I passed 44 hikers today. A handful have and will trickle in before the evening is over, but it was nice to get a feel for what kind of bubble I'm in. It means I will have to do either faster or bigger miles in order to land a spot in the shelters. Though I prefer to camp and avoid the cramped, dirty, potentially germ-filled environments that can lead to wiping out hikers, the major plus is staying warmer at night. A few faces I know include: Lucky Penny, Already Stinky, Goat, Divinci, and 82. 82's name precedes him most places he goes because anyone who starts the trail with 82lbs will be remembered.
A quick thanks to two people for new gear I've really appreciated so far, but are easy to overlook. Thank you, Holly, for the Crochs. One of my best additions. Other than protecting my feet from unseen ouchies at night, they've proven quite comfortable, and some might say stylish. Thank you, Mom, for the trekking poles at Christmas. I've hardly noticed they're there, but they've saved me from a few falls already, as well as having provided lightweight drumsticks during my on-trail drum sessions.
For day one up and into the Smokies, I couldn't have asked for a better day. Although the weather can change quickly up here, the forecast tentatively calls for similar conditions over the next couple days - cold, but at least partly sunny and dry. Here's to that holding true for as long as possible, and to even stronger legs. Tomorrow I continue to climb.","Fontana Lake, NC

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624656,"Day 16: Spence Field Shelter, NC to Newfound Gap, TN/NC - 23.9 miles:
At some point nine miles before Spence Field Shelter, I crossed into Tennessee for the first time. For the next couple hundred miles, I will crisscross between Tennessee and North Carolina as the AT follows along border. After the Roan Highlands of northeast Tennessee, I will exit North Carolina for the last time as the trail cuts towards southwest Virginia. Despite another night of shifting, unable to find comfort, I guess it's safe to assume I found sleep somewhere due to lack of any real exhaustion.
Up at 7:30am, morning chores accomplished, I procrastinated in the shelter, avoiding the cold of the morning outside. I watched a couple of hikers cooking their breakfast on a fire beneath a stone chimney on one side of the shelter, the smoke catching the rays of the morning sun as it raised and found its way out of overhead cracks in the ceiling. Eventually I decided it was time to get moving, the only way to work off the stiffness that sets in, practically aging me 50 years, between the periods of hiking.
I was the first hiker to leave the shelter, wishing the others well as I limped off, and wouldn't see any of them again for the remainder of the day. Spence Field is named so due it being an expanse of short-to-medium length grasses with few trees within the otherwise wooded coverage of the surrounding mountains. With the cold instantly freezing my hands, I knew the trail would eventually continue to climb as it made its way towards Clingmans Dome, now 17 trail miles away. Like yesterday, today would be another day of ups and downs, gradually ascending upwards in the process. I joked in my head that if you were to trip and fall in this section of the Smokies, you would most likely roll upwards. The first peaks I would top were Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountain, both topped in shorts grasses, low bushes, or rock outcroppings with few trees, offering great 180-degree views of the mountains to the east, south, and west. Now an hour after sunrise, it didn't offer quite the magic you might experience as the first shafts of sunlight light the mountains in a glow of orange fire, but it'd make for a close second.
I reached Derrick Knob Shelter in six miles, ducking in behind the tarps used to protect some of the shelters from wind entering the otherwise open fronts, I took a quick break to down some water and a few pieces of chocolate. I chatted with a hiker, packing up and getting a late start, who told me they were planning only seven miles for the day. I would pass their daily goal within the next two and a half hours, wishing to myself that I could feel accomplishment in that few miles. However, because I can't, onward I'd continue. I would would pass another 26 hikers today, a total of 70 over the past two days, which helps to show the Smokies are awfully crowded. Half of today's count were located at Silvers Bald Shelter, sitting around in the sun just outside the entrance of the shelter, mentally preparing themselves for the approaching climb up Clingmans Dome, still 1,200 vertical feet above. The beautiful, big, blue skies were all the motivation I needed to keep powering on, only stopping for a minute to stretch my legs, before continuing.
Two miles later I reached Double Spring Gap Shelter to find it empty. Again I tucked in to escape the cool breeze that'd blow all day, to enjoy a much-needed drink of water. Today's stretch would only being a couple opportunities to find water, and I'd cover it all on only two liters. Continuing up Mt. Buckley, the peak just south of Clingmans Dome, my pace drastically slowed, or at least felt like it, as each step up the steep slopes seemed labored. The summit was topped with several spruce trees, filling the air with the scent of Christmas, something I've always enjoyed in the higher elevations. After cresting the summit, I stumbled upon two turkeys walking north along the trail. Though aware of my presence, they reacted calmly and cooly, slowly and silently merging off beneath the coverage of thick brush.
Within a half-mile later, I finally summited the highest peak on the AT, Clingmans Dome, topping out at 6,667ft. Among the spruce and dead trees around the summit, sticking up towards the blue sky like broken teeth, the Clingmans Dome tower rises above all else. A long, spiraling ramp winds up and around to the observation deck above. From the top I could see the highest point east of the Mississippi, Mt. Mitchell, roughly 70 miles away as the crow flies. To the southeast, several fingers of Fontana Lake were still visible. To the west, resting at the foot of the Smokies, parts of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. Ask sat in the sun and downed a lunch of summer sausage, spam, and chocolate, I chatted with a '12 thru-hiker who is revisiting parts of the AT before a cruise at the start of April. He offered me a ride into Gatlinburg should I make it to Newfound Gap, but with plans to only reach Mt. Collins Shelter in another three miles, I thanked him and continued on. Within a half-mile later, his words sank in, gripping me,and I was unable to shake it. I made up my mind that I'd shoot for Newfound Gap and head down into Gatlinburg. With music in and cruising, willing my tired legs to get me seven more miles.
Up and over Mt. Love and Mt. Collins, my legs strained and my mouth grew dry as I downed the last of my water atop Clingmans Dome, assuming I was only going three more miles to the Mt. Collins Shelter. At 5:30pm, I exited the trail into the large parking lot at Newfound Gap, bustling with tourists enjoying the views from the gap, the road to Clingmans Dome still closed for another week. I limped to a patch of grass in the center of the commotion and collapsed for a few minutes as my legs and feet screamed at me after the 23.9 miles I asked of them today. As I was reserving a room at the Motel 6 in Gatlinburg, a man approached a hiker standing near me and offered us both a ride into town. A fan of the book, A Walk In the Woods, by Bill Bryson, he was taking pictures of where the AT enters and exits the gap, and had noticed us amidst the constant coming and going of vehicles. Soon enough we were zipping down the winding roads towards Gatlinburg below.
As we neared the place I'd be staying, I spotted Toepick sitting in a window of Cici's Pizza. After dropping my stuff in my room, I met up with her and we'd spend the next 45 minutes catching each other up on the past two days, finishing off an unhealthy amount of pizza, and drinking an even unhealthier amount of Coke in the process. As I wrap up this journal, my stomach isn't feeling too hot; I'm hoping it's just the overload of crappy pizza and nothing more serious. Toepick, having returned from taking Scout into northern Virginia, had spent some time at Newfound Gap today offering trail magic to hikers as they passed through. She is splitting a room with a female hiker, whose name I've I already forgotten, that she met while offering trail magic. After eating, we returned to the motel in a green Kia she has reserved until Monday. I went back to her room, just a few doors down from my own, and was greeted by Odin who appeared happy to see me again. I hung out for a little over an hour, the three of us chatting about our trail experiences so far. Odin has developed a limp, an unknown injury to his front right paw. Toepick will keep an eye on it through the weekend, taking him to the vet on Monday if necessary.
Having ended the day several miles ahead of my intended goal, and having originally planned to not meet Toepick at Newfound Gap until late morning tomorrow, I won't be in as big of a hurry to return to the trail tomorrow morning. With a return ride already cemented, we plan to sleep in a little, if possible, and return to Newfound Gap by 10-11am. This should still allow me to hopefully cover my mileage goal by tomorrow evening. For now, it's nearing 11:30pm, I've showered, though still smell, and have updated myself with happenings in the sports world. Hopefully sleep finds me soon, and with it the dreams of the soft curves and firm peak of Clingmans Dome.","Spence Field Shelter, NC

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624657,"Day 17: Newfound Gap, TN/NC to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, TN/NC - 16.1 miles:
Sleep wouldn't quite find me last night. After a late journal and mindlessly watching TV in order to help tune out the constant throbbing in my feet, it was close to 1:30am when I finally tried for sleep. I'd toss and turn, asking my feet to let me sleep, but before I knew it, 7am rolled around and my body was wanting to get up like it was still on the trail. A little after 8am, Toepick texted to say they were up and wanted breakfast. We hopped into the Kia rental only to cover a couple blocks til we reached the Breakfast Camp. Like everything in the Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge area, everything is created for tourists to notice, file in like cattle, hand over their money, and leave feeling as though they had a genuine experience.
The Breakfast Camp was no different; from the moment you walk in, you feel as though you're transported back into the 1800's, and damn if you aren't a hungry cowboy or cowgirl. The walk from the parking lot helped you work up quite the appetite after all. We met two other hikers waiting in line, and all got a table together. Over chilled glasses of water, and hot mugs of coffee, we chatted trail life until our platters of food arrive. My breakfast was no joke: two eggs sunny-side up, grits, potatoes, a hearty biscuit, some kinda corn mush, a steak slathered in sauteed mushrooms, gravy, and a nearly two-inch thick pancake slathered in butter, all served in a giant cast iron skillet. Eating everything and inching towards that ""I hate my life"" feeling, I knew I'd appreciate the extra calories in the hours to come.
I would then travel with Toepick and Odin to Sevierville, over a half hour away, through the congested streets of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The sidewalks teamed with tourists herding in and out of countless t-shirt and souvenir shops, eateries, museums, mini golf courses, and even more t-shirt and souvenir shops. Having been a couple thousand vertical feet higher over the last few weeks now, it was strange to feel the warmth of the sun this early in the morning, already climbing in the 60s, and to see trees blooming and green grass. All is still asleep in the mountains, and all the colors, noises, people, and quick movement of cars was a bit overwhelming to the senses. We finally reached a Little Caesars where Toepick purchased six pizzas, and we were gone almost as soon as we'd arrived, back through the gauntlet of t-shirt and souvenir shops, food of all kinds, the Titanic, and the constant exchange of money, noise, movement, everything fast.
We returned up to Newfound Gap, views now obstructed with a low, blowing fog, but the gap and nearly every pull-off into the Smokies packed with tourists - some enjoying a stroll along a flowing river, some gawking at the mountains overhead, others eating lunch in patches of sun. With tourists walking this way and that, some of the more adventurous ones heading into and out of the AT to the north, I said a quick goodbye to Toepick and Odin, and was back heading north at 12:45pm. Toepick would remain at the gap for the remainder of the afternoon, eager to share trail magic with any who appeared from the south. I really wanted a Coke I knew was stashed in the back of the Kia, but I remained strong. Odin was still showing signs of some kinda foot injury, favoring it all night and this morning, but Toepick will monitor it over the upcoming weekend. I hope he gets back to himself soon and that it's nothing serious.
The trail was relatively well-graded and worn from the thousands of day, weekend, and thru-hikers who pass between Newfound Gap to Charlie's Bunion each year. With music in again, I would spend the first hour and a half passing slower hikers, the past two weeks having given me my mountain legs, as they huffed and puffed their way along. The first three miles took me up 1,000ft, past Icewater Spring Shelter, and to Charlie's Bunion. The fog melted away and the sun shown through within 20 minutes of me reaching Charlie's Bunion. Having not had a view two years ago, it really felt like the AT has spoiled me this time through, gifting me with the nice weather and great views I missed last time, her way of thanking me for returning. I stood for a couple minutes on that sharp rock outcropping that I Charlie's Bunion, parts of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge once again visible far below, and grabbed a few pictures. With the late start, though, I had miles to cover before evening fell.
The remainder of the afternoon would shift between moments of sun and grand views, and a wall of blowing fog that made it seem as though the small strip of land I was walking over was all there was and ever would be. Passing the Sawteeth and Bradley's View, one offered a view, one didn't. The tourists stop at Charlie's Bunion and the trail returned to its more natural, rugged state. I would briefly catch up with ""Just Kevin"", now having flip-flopped with him over the past week, chatting briefly each time. After a few minutes of catching up, I would return to my pace, and he was soon far behind. I wouldn't see another hiker until hours later, within 20 minutes of reaching my goal for the day.
What I did see, however, were mountains full of life, the kind you normally don't notice because it's not of the crawling, biting, flying, or killing kind. While climbing up and over Mt Sequoyah and Mt Chapman, I noticed and watched for the different kinds and colors of moss covering the trunks of both standing and fallen trees lining the trail. All the greens- lime, Kelly, forest, and Hunter - were there to enjoy. Wrapped around downed logs, draped from rock faces, and covering the forest floor, the mosses played no favorites. Other than the richness of a blue sky and the blinding white of snow, it's been the only other visual stimulus so far.
As I rounded a corner of the trail, I noticed there familiar hikers up ahead who I hadn't yet met, but knew through Toepick sharing. Enter Momma Bear, Little Foot, and Double Barrel. Momma Bear appears to be in her upper 20s or lower 30s, good for her age, regardless, and is thru-hiking with her five year old son, Little Foot. Even after nearly 12 miles on the day, I could tell Little Foot still had a reservoir of energy that adult hikers seem to lack, or are unwilling to tap into. Toepick had told me he was running and playing with Odin during yesterday's trail magic, and I now could see what she meant. I exchanged a few comments with them, but felt kinda bad having told them, from my guesstimation at my pace, that I believed the shelter was no more than 20 minutes away. A few bends in the trail and a hill later, I was relieved to know I was accurate.
My relief with having reached 16.1 miles in just under six hours was short-lived when I realized the shelter and few campsites around were already full by yet another bubble I've caught up to. I sat off to the side alone, downing a 500-calorie honey bun and drinking my first water since breakfast, mindlessly listening to all the different banter and conversations, hearing just noise and no actual words. I was more focused on finding a place to get horizontal. As nice as the Smokies have been this time through, this is why my goal has been to get through them as quickly as possible, so I can get back to camping wherever, and not having to worry about reaching a mandatory shelter before other hikers. I found an area down a sharp slope that'll work; it has to. The spot is too small and slanted to set up my tent, but it does come with a free log that I've used as a side/back brace to keep me from rolling down the mountain into oblivion. By staking he corners of my rain-fly into the mountainside and holding it up with my trekking poles, I've created a shelter. Though open on the bottoms, it will hopefully help by keeping out 10% of the cold. I'll take what I can get.
Tomorrow will be a day as difficult as the climb up into the Smokies two days ago. However, this time it'll be in reverse as I drop out of them. If I can hit my goal tomorrow, it will have me dropping nearly 5,000ft in elevation over a span of 17.5 miles. As I wrap up this journal in my little shelter on a mountainside, my back shoved up against this log I hope doesn't fail me overnight, my feet are once again throbbing, preventing comfort from finding me. Whether I reach my goal tomorrow or not, one thing I'm certain about is it will be hell on my feet and knees tomorrow night.","Newfound Gap TN/NC

The log held true last night and I lived to see another day, having not rolled off into the darken abyss as I slept. Despite the usual tossing and turning, I know I slept in the early morning hours because I had a series of dreams, my first since beginning my hike. At some point in the night I shifted, hitting a trekking pole in the process, causing my rainfly to collapse in on me. Other than that, I remained warm as I listened to the wind howling through the trees above me, happy that it wasn't blowing below because my trekking poles wouldn't have withstood the beating.
In the morning I downed a thousand calories worth of pop tarts and a honey bun. I then utilized the fallen log that held me in place overnight as a poop-log, taking care of business while still beneath the cover of my rain-fly. After packing up, I climbed back up the mountainside to the shelter where the majority of hikers were slowly packing and heading out. I stood in front of the fireplace listening to the crackle of an early morning fire, the heat warming my numb fingers. I watched as Double Barrel, who's been hiking with Mama Bear and Little Foot, live up to his trail name by stuffing two bear canisters into his 75L pack, barely able to close the top, and part of me died inside for him. Little Foot shuffled to get his trekking poles, along with his mom's and Double Barrel's which were taller than him, and clumsily returned with them.
I set off at 8:30am, into the fog blanketing the peaks, and was eventually closing in on and passing hikers that started before me. Within the first couple miles, as I climbed Mt. Guyot, a dull pain developed in my left leg, running from my hip, through my knee, and down to my foot. I did my best to not favor the leg, for that usually only makes things worse, but it caused me to have to catch my breath several times throughout the morning as a sharper pain occasionally appeared. The pain would subside a bit as the day rolled on, but would remain the entire time and cause the descent put of the mountains to be a bit more difficult than it otherwise should've been. My guess is a pinched nerve due to sleeping in an exaggerated bowl-shaped position throughout the night, curving at the hips in the process.
At one point in the morning, a fighter jet of some kind flew over, the roar of the engine filling and ricocheting off the valley walls to the west. Believing the Russians and North Koreans would soon follow, falling slowly beanth the canopy of parachutes, I thought about running off to recruit hikers for a Red Dawn-esque resistance. Minutes later, as the roaring intensified and returned, I was sure the pilot was looking for a lowly hiker to release his napalm on. Either my mind simply ran wild or the pilot found another hiker, but I was ultimately spared and continued on.
The day would pass in a blur as I averaged 3mph, stopping only once for 20 minutes to eat a small lunch and chug some water. I noticed the first signs of grouse, or fool hens, the sound of a drum coming from the brush nearby, slowly gaining in speed. I knew better than to go searching for it. They're known as being dumb and, instead of taking flight like most birds, will hide until you're nearly on top of them before shooting up in a burst of commotion, sounding like a helicopter in the process. I would continue downhill for another few miles, passing by (Bill) Cosby('s) Knob Shelter at the halfway mark. A little over an hour later I reached the Great Smoky Mountains National Park northern boundary and turned in my permit copy, completing my trek through the Smokies in four days, officially smoking the Smokies in the process.
After passing a small road and climbing a small hill back I to the woods, I stumbled across trail magic a hundred feet or so in. Two styrofoam coolers sat on the ground and were stuffed with Coke, PBR, chips, and chocolates. I quickly downed a bag of Lays chips and a Coke, leaving the trash in a bag tied in a tree. After considering what I knew would be a smaller number of hikers to reach that point today, I grabbed another Coke, stuffing it in my pants pocket, and hiked on. Two miles later, the sound of humming traffic filled the warm air as I neared I-40. I began dropping towards the interstate, following along the low, though steady flow, of a creek that dropped into the larger Pigeon River below. The trail meandered along the creek as it gradually dropped down the mountain, forming small pools that, a couple months from now, would be a treat to rest and cool off in.
I exited the woods onto a bridge spanning the Pigeon River. I paused to snap a picture of a rafting guide, sitting in his raft below the bridge, instructing three people on what to expect in their ride ahead. A moment later a father and son stopped in their vehicle behind me, asked if I needed anything, but I assured them I was near the conclusion of my day. I passed under I-40, vehicles whizzing by between Knoxville, TN and Asheville, NC, and made my way to a steeply-graded staircase leading back into the woods on the opposite side of the interstate. A mile later after paralleling a couple hundred feet above the interstate, the trail crosses a gravel road that leads to Standing Bear Hostel, I popular spot for hikers to drop into post-Smokies. With camping, a bunkhouse, private rooms, a decent resupply selection, and a place to purchase and enjoy beer, the hostel offers anything a hiker could want, whether staying or simply dropping in.
I ended up arriving at 2:30pm, an hour and a half before Toepick and Odin were due to pick me up, so I enjoyed the time being lazy, chatting with hikers I hadn't met before, and downing three Coke's. My feet and knees began throbbing as soon as I stopped moving and are still doing so as I wrap up this entry at 10:30pm, eight hours after finishing hiking for the day. Toepick and Odin arrived at 4:30pm, Odin still limping on his paw, but looking a bit stronger. I showed them around the hostel, but we were soon gone, heading towards Newport, TN, around 20 minutes down I-40. Another Motel 6 is home for the night. Having filled up on food at a nearby Ruby Tuesday - a burger with onion rings, bacon, cheese, and BBQ sauce, and a couple trips to the garden bar - I'm back to feeling regular again. Although my original goal was to reach Hot Springs, NC, another two and a half to three days away, before my next zero, I've instead decided to utilize one tomorrow. After cruising through the Smokies in four days, plus the addition of today's leg pain, I think it'd be wisest to take a step back. It'll also help give Odin another day to bounce back from his paw injury.
Hoping tomorrow brings as little physical activity as possible. Will be back at it on Monday.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, TN/NC

I woke at 7am, unable to sleep in even on a zero day. With Toepick and Odin still sleeping in their bed, I went about watching my favorite movie that I've been wanting to see soon after beginning my hike, For Love of the Game, with Kevin Costner. I was able to squeeze in about an hour of it before Toepick was up and wanting to set out for breakfast. I plan to finish the remainder of it tonight.
By 10am we found ourselves sitting at a table in Cracker Barrel, surrounded by locals in their Sunday best, fresh out of church. We both played the game that comes on every table, where you try to see how few golf tees you can end up with which, according to the rules, determines how smart or idiotic you are. We both concluded the trail has turned our brains into mush. We were soon fork-deep in eggs, pork chops, hash browns, grits, biscuits and gravy, fried apples, and French toast. With belt buckle loosened, I waddled out and took my spot in the passenger seat as Toepick drove us an hour away to Max Patch, a large bald mountaintop just outside of the Smokies that allows for 360-degree views. We will be hiking over it tomorrow when we return to the trail, but with no guarantee of a view then, we took advantage of the good weather today.
As we zipped along I-40, we sang to country music, and I introduced Toepick to Home Free, a dominantly a capella country band that cover a lot of your favorites. She's hooked now as well. We reached where the AT crosses a gravel road near the base of Max Patch after half an hour of winding our way up the mountain, hitting every bump and pothole in the process. Before climbing to he bald top, we walked a couple hundred feet into the woods along the AT and dropped off the remaining trail magic from Toepick's stockpile over the past several days: Coke (I kept two), Mt Dew, chips, crackers, brownies, and bananas. At a small Creek crossing, we left the food under a rhododendron bush and placed the soda cans in the water, allowing them to chill. Our timing couldn't have been better as half a dozen or so hikers soon passed by as we left to go climb up.
The top of Max Patch was bustling with activity, as far as mountaintops go, with tourists aimlessly walking around, taking photos of mountains in the distance. The Smokies rose just to the south, the tops hidden behind low hanging grey clouds. Isolated pockets of rain temporarily dotted the horizon in nearly every direction at some point during the afternoon, but Max Patch remained sunny and warm, though with a constant, stiff wind. Several hikers dropped their packs and enjoyed the view, and one, named Booty, serenaded Toepick and I with his miniature guitar. After close to two hours we finally made our way back down the steep incline and returned to Newport.
We returned at 4pm and, as we sat in the parking lot chatting, noticed a building nearby with a lot of activity. After using Google maps, we discovered it was a small four-screen theater. Out of curiosity I checked the movie listings and noticed the next round began at 5pm and, more importantly, only cost $5 for a ticket. With a limited selection, and after watching a movie trailer, I decided to go see The Shack. Toepick stayed behind and utilized the time by watching crappy TV and napping. Along with seven other people, I sat in the darkness of the small auditorium for two hours and enjoyed a fine film. My only critique would've been trying to bite off more than it could chew, topic wise, but overall a solid flick. Oh, and Tim McGraw should narrate more. He's dreamy.
Tomorrow I'll return to the trail, along with Toepick and Odin who've enjoyed several days off as I trekked through the Smokies, and will continue north.","Newport, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624660,"Day 20: Standing Bear Hostel, TN to Roaring Fork Shelter, NC - 15.2 miles:
I finally fell asleep in the early AM after finishing For Love of the Game. I would do the usual overnight shuffle, but sleep would find me. Toepick was up and out by 7am, heading an hour back to Gatlinburg to pick up a hiker wanting to go to Standing Bear Hostel she had promised a ride. I was up and moving by 7:30am, hanging out with Odin as I slowly repacked my gear, and was nearly packed when they returned just before 9am. Once we were ready we headed to the nearby McDonald's so I could get a breakfast sandwich after skipping dinner last night. A bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit with a Coke never tasted so good. Toepick downed a yogurt and breakfast burrito, and then we were zipping eastward along I-40, back into the mountains.
We returned to Standing Bear Hostel around 10am where Toepick dropped Odin and I off before she headed back to Newport to detail her rental car, removing a ton of Odin's hair, so she wouldn't be charged extra for the cleaning fee. In what would take nearly two hours to complete and return, I hung out at the hostel with Odin, chatting with hikers, enjoying a couple more chilled Coke's, and overall just keeping Odin out of trouble. He continued his quest to score free food from hikers, but the process seems to be gradually becoming more difficult as the hiker hunger takes control of hikers and they're less likely to toss him something. He also seemed determined to catch a rooster and chicken that occasionally appeared from the bushes surrounding the central hub area of the hostel. I weighed myself and realized I had put on five pounds of the eleven I've lost so far in the 24 hours since I'd last been there. It won't last long though.
I chatted off and on with Mama Bear, Little Foot, and Double Barrel. At one point Mama Bear asked Double Barrel to watch Little Foot as she went off to work on resupplying and repacking their gear. Within minutes Little Foot was in a small Creek that runs through the center of the hostel, boots and all, throwing and retrieving a pink soccer ball, and would eventually prolong their set-off time due to having to wait for them to dry. Double Barrel joked that his mother would never trust him to watch her son again. Half of the hikers set off towards the trail around 10:30am while the other half settled in to enjoy the day off. After having to wait around for so long, I was tempted to stay myself in order to avoid having to push hard with a half day, but knew it was just my feet talking. Just before noon Toepick arrived, we prepped our gear, and off we were, beginning with a four-and-a-half mile climb out of the hostel.
The going was slow and steady, me falling in behind Toepick and Odin, who quickly seemed to shake off his limp by running up and down the trail, quickly tiring himself in the heat of the early afternoon. We reached Painter Branch, a small campsite next to a calm-flowing creek, halfway up the climb where Toepick needed to stop for water. She found a bottle of moonshine sitting near the water. We initially had no interest in it, but then reconsidered. It seems to make sense that it's bad luck to turn down trail magic, whether it's a Coke, a burger, a ride, or moonshine. We both took two shots, the clear liquid burning as it traveled down our throats, instantly causing our body temps to rise. I juggled the idea of enjoying a few more sips to take the edge off today's hike, but reconsidered when I thought about the possibility of losing my clothes and partaking in National Hike Naked Day three months too early.
Within the next mile it began to lightly rain as the skies turned grey with clouds, and the surrounding mountains fell behind curtains of distant rain. Fortunately it wasn't heavy rain, but instead the kid that helps to cool you off as you hike. Toepick soon stopped again for her and Odin's water break, my only fluid intake being the moonshine, and I decided I was gonna go at my pace for the day. Having been off the last several days, it may take a bit for their six hiking legs to return. At 2pm, as Odin made his way back towards Toepick after initially trying to keep up with me, I turned and was gone. Half an hour later I reached the summit of Snowbird Mountain. A strange, alien spaceship-like building, in actuality an FFA tower, sits atop the summit and has several signs warning prosecution in a federal court of law if you do X, Y, or Z within the small fence that surrounds the building. I walked around he perimeter of the fence, instead taking in the 360-degree view of near and distant mountains alike, shrouded in the grey veils of rain. Looking back towards the Smokies, I could tell it wouldn't have been an enjoyable day there. As I looked towards Max Patch, where Toepick, Odin, and I lounged in the sun the previous afternoon, I was glad to know we had gone early as the day ahead didn't look very promising.
As I headed down the north side of Snowbird I hit a groove, averaging 3mph, and would maintain it the remainder of the afternoon. An hour later I lowered into Deep Gap where I breaked for lunch. Another hiker I didn't know sat just off the trail with the same idea, quietly eating, reading, and letting his dogs air out. After quickly stuffing jerky, chocolate, and nutri grain bars into my mouth, I was up and gone in 20 minutes. With six miles left to go until Max Patch, I powered my way up and down several smaller mountains, Max Patch seeming to always slip behind the next one, hiding from me. I eventually began passing hikers that had left an hour and a half or more before me this morning. As they slowly chugged their way up the mountains, I cruised by knowing I wasn't planning on stopping until atop Max Patch.
At 5pm, I finally crested the summit, having followed a series of wooden posts, a white blaze on each, winding me up and around to the summit. I reached the top just in time to catch a local man chatting with a hiker, Pilgrim, and warning him about staying on the summit. Although the evening had returned to being pleasant, the summit now bathed in evening sun peering through the clouds, weather is supposedly in the forecast overnight. I considered the idea of staying in the bald expanse myself, enjoying both an unobscured sunset and sunrise, but with rain possibly coming, it'd be one of the last places I'd want to be caught. With the next shelter only two miles away, as well as lower in elevation, I knew hiking as hard as I did to end up short of 15 miles would seem like a disappointment to me. Down I went, back into the treeline, to cover the final two easy miles into Roaring Fork Shelter.
At 6:15pm I reached the shelter, already full with the other hikers who left Standing Bear Hostel earlier in the morning, and who I didn't have the chance to catch. I was fortunate enough to score a perfectly flat earthen tent platform, but will end up wet if or when it rains tonight. Can't win them all, but it's important to be appreciative of what you do have. Several of the hikers I passed stumbled in over an hour later, and will be pitching their tents on the remaining unlevel, slanted ground.
I once again have no signal at this location so I'll have to wait and find a high point tomorrow before posting. My goal tomorrow will either be another ~15 miles to a shelter just outside of Hot Springs, NC, or push it ~18 miles into town. I would still find a place to camp, avoiding having to pay to stay somewhere again, but the thought of access to a Coke or real meal might be enough motivation to get me there. Regardless of where I end up, the terrain brings two back-to-back ~1,000ft climbs, before gradually descending towards town.
It's 8:15pm as I'm wrapping this up. My feet are sore, my leg is still bothersome, and several dogs - hounds, perhaps - are annoyingly barking from some distant place. However, the camp is quiet, I have a shelter over my head and water readily available, and I'm 15 miles ahead of where I was this morning. Onward.","Standing Bear Hostel, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624661,"Day 21: Roaring Fork Shelter, NC to Hot Springs, NC - 17.9 miles:
Within half an hour of wrapping up last night's entry, I heard a familiar jingling of a dog collar, along with the heavy breaths of Odin walking past my tent. A headlamp passed soon after. I eventually motivated myself to get up and confirm it was him and Toepick. I stumbled over in the direction of the shelter, some 30 yards away, to find Toepick standing, looking for level ground to pitch her tent. When Odin saw me he jumped up, placing his paws on my shoulders and nearly knocking me over, his face briefly flashing a bright red in the light of my headlamp. He was rough and tumble with me, having missed me since earlier in the day. I concluded today that although Toepick is his human who he loves and respects, I'm like his frat brother.
I lead them back over to my tent and down a small hill to a flat spot I noticed earlier in the evening, and most likely the last flat spot in the area. I sat petting Odin as he slept in a bed of soft leaves, waiting for Toepick to prepare the tent. When she was done, I said g'night to them both and returned to my tent. With earplugs in, I eventually fell into a brief, though deep sleep, waking at some point to the sound of rain bouncing off my rainfly. The rain created a comforting white noise, and I spent the remainder of the overnight hours drifting in and out of sleep as they rain fell harder. Although the bottom of my tent would be covered in mud in the morning due to splash from the rain, I remained dry and comfortable.
Up just after 7am, I began the slow process of packing up, eating junk for breakfast, brushing my teeth, and pouring out the previous night's pee-bottle, all from the warm confines of my tent. With nothing left to do, I exited into the cool morning air, packed up my tent, and went to the shelter to kill time before Toepick was ready to leave. Although I always give her plenty of warning before setting off, 30-45 minutes usually, she always finds a way to get us behind schedule. At 8:45am we finally set off into the thick fog hugging the valley floor and surrounding mountains, determined to cover 18 miles into Hot Springs, NC.
Today's trek would be the kind that tests your mental toughness. No, it wasn't the coldest day, or the rainiest, or the muddiest, or even the most difficult terrain, but it had just enough of each to make it the least enjoyable day so far. The fog stripped us of any potential views, the mud was slick enough to cause downhills to be slow and steady, the rain was just hard and cold enough to reach your bones, and the terrain was just rugged enough to make me feel every bit of 18 miles on my feet upon completion. At one point in the first couple of miles a tree fell and cracked right on the trail, 20 feet in front of us, five seconds before we would've been standing where it landed. The tree was small enough where it wouldn't have killed us, but it would've most likely taken us to the ground, big ""WTF's?"" coming from our mouths afterward. It was just that kinda day.
We pushed our way up and over both Walnut and Bluff Mountains, the only real climbs for the day, before taking a lunch break. With no desire to eat what was in my food bag, I ended up giving half of what I took out to Odin - pepperoni, beef sticks, and half of my tuna. Any day where there's the possibility of eating regular food, the crap I carry just becomes even more crappier. It was nice to have a furry garbage disposal with me. After lunch, we'd spend the majority of the final 11 miles dropping ~3,000ft towards Hot Springs, an occasional small mountain in between making the process seem futile. At exactly 2:05pm, the sun broke through the clouds, finally drenching everything in its warm light. Most of the fog burned away, except along the summit of Bluff Mountain, now rising high behind us. As the temperature warmed and the uphills continued, the pace dropped to a painstakingly slow speed. With no desire to bust out the miles I knew I was capable of doing, I remained behind Toepick and Odin who, through the returned pain in his right leg, hobbled on three legs for the majority of the day.
We finally crested Deer Park Mountain and began winding our way down a ridge when Hot Springs came into view. Tucked in a green valley by a bend in the French Broad River, the trail descends quickly, giving the appearance you're dropping right in on top of the small town. A motorcycle could be heard breaking the still air above, but otherwise the town seemed sleepy from atop the ridge. We winded our way down, the buildings, homes, trees, and everything that makes a town a town, gradually coming into sharper focus. The process was agonizingly slow as Toepick, Odin, and me limped our aching feet downwards. We finally exited the woods at 4:45pm in a small gravel parking lot, right next to home for the night, the Laughing Heart Hostel.
We quickly entered, paid our dues, hung our tents on lines to dry, took showers, and adorned ""town clothes"" from a stockpile. I scored the only things in my size, nurse scrubs, black bottoms and a green top. Comfortability at its finest. We put Odin in a room to sleep while we left, and slowly hobbled our way downtown to the Spring Creek Tavern for dinner. Several other hikers sat at tables on an outside patio overlooking the creek below. A few locals stood fishing before giving up and skipping rocks instead. Toepick and I joined Tank and Peace Walker, a French woman, at a table and enjoyed one another company while we waited for our meals. Unable to decide what would hit the spot, I ordered a water, Coke, and Coors Light to accompany my fried chicken sandwich and fries. Although I felt human again after eating, I was easily nowhere near feeling full.
We made our way back towards the hostel, stopping in Dollar General to resupply, although the selection was quite limited. Needing 4-5 days of food for the next stretch, I purchased what few items I could as a non-stove user: cookies, breakfast bars, and crackers. Little variety, but it'll have to get me to Erwin, TN in around ~70 miles from here. Back at the hostel, hikers relaxed and enjoyed their own versions of entertainment: one was eating a pizza while watching a movie on a TV older than me, a second sat relaxing on his bunk, several were chatting, another played with a black cat, and others still were cracking open a 12-pack of beer.
As it closes in on 10pm, I'm sitting alone in my room, Odin asleep on the floor nearby, the low hum of the AC in the background. Toepick just came in with our clean laundry, and returned outside to see what the supposed hiker karaoke was all about. She just returned to grab her phone, telling me it was ""gettin' lit"", whatever that means. The younger generation and their vocabulary. Odin is mid-dream, his feet slightly moving, perhaps as he chases a rabbit or female dog, or is running up and down the AT as has become his life over the past few weeks.
Today wraps up 21 days on the trail so far. To toss out a comparison, this past Fall I thru-hiked the Natchez Trace, 460 miles between Nashville, TN and Natchez, MS. I completed it in exactly 21 days. As of tonight, I've completed 273 miles of the AT. This really helps to put in perspective the difference between mileages accomplished when road-walking vs a trail such as the AT.
Tomorrow will be a nearo of some sort out of town. With aching feet, I'm in no hurry to leave. I instead will be enjoying breakfast at a local diner, dropping by the library to see if I'm able to upload pictures or not, and then eventually wandering back into the mountains. Tonight, though, I rest easy feeling appreciative as I close in on another 300 miles of a trail as special as this one.","Roaring Fork Shelter, NC

I woke just after 7am after less than five hours of sleep. With original plans of hiking out, I had chores to take care of and soon set off to begin the process. My first stop was to head a few hundred yards, as the crow flies, to the Smoky Mountain Diner, made more complicated due to having to navigate a steep staircase down the side of a hill, passing within 20-30ft of someone's backdoor, before reaching the road the diner was located on. The morning promised a great day ahead, a light fog still snaking it's way through the valley above the French Broad River. The sky was cloudless, ranging from near white around the rising sun to a brilliant, confident sky blue in the opposite direction.
With Toepick in tow, we entered the diner, seated ourselves in an over-sized booth in the back, and chatted as we waited for our food to arrive, sleep still heavy in our eyes. After what seemed an excessive amount of time, our plates of food arrived - French toast and yogurt for Toepick, four eggs, crispy bacon, sausage, hash browns, grits, and what seemed like an entire loaf of toast for me. After feeling satisfyingly full, we made our way back up the hill to the hostel. Toepick would spend the morning waiting for a veterinarian to drop in and check on the condition of Odin; I would pack my gear before making my way back into the small downtown area, passing a small hotel, the post office, a lonely gas station, and an outfitter before reaching the small town library. For a small donation, I was told most people donate $1, but I gave $3 due to the length of time I expected to spend, I was shown into a small computer room with half a dozen computers. Over the next two hours I would lightly edit photos I've taken over the past couple weeks and post them to Facebook. My news feed would quickly and steadily blow up by the liking of every other picture from my twin brother, Ryan, a lot like a crazy ex girlfriend might.
Upon completion I walked back into the sunny afternoon and met Toepick and Odin who had walked down from the hostel to go to the post office. Toepick updated me of the vet's visit: she found no breaks, sprains, tears, etc, and contributed his limping to nothing more to soreness like all hikers experience. Confident it shouldn't mess with his ability to go on, Toepick feels confident in moving forward with him. Deciding we were once again hungry, we walked to the nearby Hillbilly Market and ordered some reasonably priced subs where lack of meat wasn't an issue. We walked back to the hostel where we'd relax in the heat of the sun, enjoying our sandwiches, and chatting with other hikers who were enjoying a nice day of rest as well. After lunch I stumbled across a hacky sack in the yard and a handful of us would spend over an hour playing a pathetic version of something resembling the game. With shirts off, the sun felt good on our bodies that have otherwise been traveling within a sea of trees over the past several weeks.
As the afternoon gradually transitioned into evening, the mountains to the east glowing in warm oranges and reds with the setting sun, we all decided we were once again hungry. This evening we were treated to a fried feast thanks to the Laughing Heart Hostel. With the sound of crackling oil and the scent of fried catfish and frog legs filling the air, it pulled Toepick and I back up the hill to the hostel after we quickly ran down to the Dollar General to grab a few things for the evening, food for Odin, and a liter each of Coke and Sprite for me. The Coke has since been enjoyed, and the Sprite will help jump-start me in the morning. Along with the fried deliciousness, we enjoyed baked beans, coleslaw, and a variety of cookies.
As darkness fell, a decent congregation of hikers still outside lounging on picnic tables and chairs, the hostel caretaker brought out a karaoke machine for any hiker brave enough to partake it. Toepick kicked it off, and a steady stream has followed suit, but it lacks the enthusiasm of last night's karaoke session that lasted until 2am. There was a fair share of alcohol enjoyed last night, which contributed to its success. I was up until 2am myself, but in my room enjoying a book. After originally planning to read to hopefully grow tired, I ended up reading all of Heaven is for Real, and really enjoyed it.
So, in the end, today became another unplanned zero. I didn't expect my time at the library to take as long as it did, but I'm happy to offer some pictures for followers to enjoy and get a small glimpse into the world of thru-hiking. The next couple days should bring rain, the large weather system making its way across the country, but weather is simply part of the journey, and I've had a decent taste of it so far. Tomorrow will either bring weak legs or fresh legs, but it'll be onward and upward back into the mountains, heading towards Erwin, TN, ~70 miles away.","Laughing Heart Hostel (Hot Springs, NC)

The day began at 7am after waking from a fitful sleep with my stomach hurting. My initial thought was I was sick, and staying in hiker-filled hostels had caught up with me. I exited my bunk only to find all three bathrooms were occupied with showering hikers. With nothing to do to take my mind off the roaring and tumbling happening deep in my stomach, I had myself a coffee. Not the smartest move, I know, but I figured I'd go big since it was inevitable. Finally a door opened, a hiker exited, and in one move I was in, door closed, and sitting on a toilet freshly warmed by the steam of the hiker's shower. The next few moments were pure bliss as I filled the volume of the toilet to the point I began looking for something to switch over to and finish. Ok, not really, but one can dream. It would happen once more within the next hour, but on a much less grander scale. A big crisis was averted and, fortunately, I was not sick and instead simply cleaned out from the fried catfish and frog legs last night. Phew.
A couple hours later Toepick, Odin, and me finally motivated ourselves enough to slowly get moving across the still sleepy town of Hot Springs, and back into the mountains on the far side. The trail crossed the French Broad River before cutting into the woods and running within feet of the rushing water for half a mile or so. It then began cutting up and, through a series of switchbacks, had us back on a ridge overlooking the town. With it taking us an hour to cover the distance to this point, I decided I wouldn't be able to reach my goal of ~20 miles without taking until 7pm to do so. Toepick and I looked at the guide and came to a compromise. With a nine-mile gap between shelters, at 11 and 20 miles in, she wanted to do the first while I wanted the second. With rain/storms in the forecast, we decided to shoot for a hostel located ~16 miles in, thus Cambo's 2017 Hostel Tour continues. At 11am I would break off from the two of them and hike at my own pace for the day.
Forty-five minutes later I caught up with Tank who had passed us as Toepick and I were discussing the day's plan, excessively sweating or ""detoxing"" as he'd later tell me. I would use Tank as my pace car all day, staying within 20-30 yards behind him, but holding pace. The terrain would lead us mainly up, up onto the tops of mountains and ridges shrouded in fog, a steady wind blowing through the trees all day, occasionally pushing my pack and making me walk at an angle. Tank and I cruised until reaching Spring Mountain Shelter around 2pm. We briefly shut it down to grab a quick lunch - two fruity pebbles breakfast bars for me. Another hiker arrived, a strange character, who seemed to enjoy bragging about his large calves and hiking speed. To each his own, but as he headed off I couldn't help but think he needs to watch that cockiness. If the AT hears him, she just might have something to say about it.
A few miles later Tank and I reached Allen Gap, a small highway running east-west between Tennessee and North Carolina. A few handmade signs advertised Mom's Store about a hundred yards off the trail. I remembered peering through the dirty glass of the run-down looking building two years ago, brokenhearted that it was then closed, knowing chilled Coke's waited just inside. Today, however, it was open and Tank and I spent 45 minutes sitting in two old, dusty chairs, chatting with the owner, and commenting on some of the old advertising - Marlboro signs and the like from the 80's or 90's - that may be worth a little something today. ""What the fuuuuuuuuuu........ck"" I quietly thought inside when I read a small paper advertising a can of Coke would cost me $1.25. I did as any smart person might and purchased two.
Back on the trail Tank and I crested a ridge just above Allen Gap, and I noticed a small campsite tucked beneath some rhododendron that I remembered fondly. Two years ago, several of us cowboy camped in a pile together in the spot while Tick Tock read to us from a book a friend of hers had written after completing the PCT, Thru-Hiking Will Break Your Heart, by Carrot Quinn. All I remember about the book was that I had enjoyed it, the combination of the authors words and Tick Rocks voice softly lulled me to sleep. My mom would give me this same book as a Christmas gift this past year - small world. No more than a mile and a half later, Tank and I reached Log Cabin Rd, my ending point for the day. He would continue another three miles to the shelter while I would trek .7 down a road, through some farmland with grazing cows, and a house with a dozen or so barking dogs nestled up against the road.
I reached Hemlock Hollow Inn and Paint Creek Cafe just before 5pm with a small group of other hikers I'd stayed with at the Laughing Heart Hostel, all with the same plan to hopefully miss out on a night of rain and storms. A small office/common area is stocked with basic resupply options, junk food mainly, coffee, drinks, and a freezer stuffed with pizza, burgers and the like. I was taken to a small cabin by the kind hostel caretaker - a simple bed, wooden table and chairs, a mini fridge, and a microwave. A small bathroom/shower-house stood nearby. Within minutes I was taking a shower, quickly scrubbing myself so I'd stay under five minutes. A sign next to he shower said anything over five minutes would cause the next person to have to wait for 20 minutes for hot water to return. No one wants or should be that guy.
I've been in the common area since around 6pm, using WiFi in order to journal and catch up on stuff. Just before 7pm Toepick and Odin arrive. Toepick, almost instantly, dived into a warm pizza. Odin went to begging from others, but with no luck. It's now just after 7:30pm, but it's time for me to head back to my cabin, where no signal exists. Perfect. Tomorrow, rain or shine, it's back into the mountains.","Laughing Heart Hostel (Hot Springs, NC)

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624664,"Day 24: Hemlock Hollow Inn & Paint Creek Cafe, TN to Flint Mountain Shelter, TN - 17.3 miles:
Not a wink of sleep last night. I gave up trying at 6:30am, packing up my gear and walking over to the store/communal area of the hostel. I walked in and was welcomed with the smell of hot coffee, and would enjoy two cups, along with two bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches, as I waited for Toepick to arrive. At 8:30am she was ready, and we loaded our gear into the back of a truck and were slowly returned to the trail-head .7 miles away. After a nice of rain, the morning looked promising as patches of blue sky could be seen overhead, the sun already warming the morning air. We hit the trail at 8:45am and immediately began climbing our way up ~5 miles to the ridge we'd follow for the remainder of the day.
Within 20 minutes of climbing, I noticed the sun and blue sky had disappeared, replaced by low hanging grey clouds. The wind picked up and added a coolness to the morning. I happened to glance over my shoulder at the mountains behind me and noticed they, too, had disappeared behind a wall of fog. A minute later I glanced again and noticed the grey wall was much closer, extending from the sky above to the ground below, and was closing fast. I quickly dropped my gear, put on my rain jacket, and enclosed my pack in its rain cover. I glanced again and noticed the wall was nearly on top of me, trees I had just passed were now completely hidden. Fearing the approaching fog was, like in the second Hunger Games, a poisonous gas tributes must run from to survive, I closed my eyes and released a small whimper as it engulfed me. It may not have been poisonous gas, but it brought along with it a wall of cold rain. I thought about yelling ahead to Toepick where the rain and fog had yet to reach, but figured, screw it.
The rain would last nearly an hour, soaking me, the trail, and everything around in the process. When it let up, I was left dripping, nearly frozen, violated, and with not so much as a phone call afterwards. Along with the overnight rain, the trail was reduced to a series of mud holes, standing pools of water, and even flowing streams over certain stretches of trail. The day would rotate between periods of thick and light rolling fog, occasionally clearing, but all beneath a low ceiling of grey clouds. The sun would only appear twice today, lasting no more than a minute each time. Toepick quickly adopted the ""f it"" mentality, walking through puddles and mud, not seeming to care, but I would follow behind as I rock-hopped to avoid fully soaking my shoes and socks.
The first quick break came after three miles when we reached Little Laurel Shelter. Toepick only stopped for a moment to check the guide, but I would linger a few extra minutes to down a few snacks before catching back up with her. Several opportunities for views were missed today due to the always present fog including: Jones Meadow, Whiterock Cliff, Blackstack Cliffs, and a stretch of exposed ridge line trail. A wooden sign marks where the AT heads up towards the ridge line or, if bad weather is eminent, offers a side trail. Previous hikers, using sharpies, wrote the following for each trail option: for the exposed ridge line trail, ""bouldering, harder, view"", and for the bad weather trail, ""original AT route, easier, no shame."" We of course stuck to the current AT route and were soon crossing a thin, rocky ridge line, walls of fog blocking the nearly 360-degree views. I remembered crossing this ridge line two years ago with Burnsides and Moosehead, stopping to chat with some trail maintainers who were installing a plaque on a rock, commemorating Howard McDonald, a master trail builder. The plaque looked as new as the day they installed it nearly two years ago now. The mike-and-a-half stretch slowed us down as we navigated a series of boulders and rock scrambles, slowed by the slick rocks and blowing wind. Odin would occasionally run ahead and top a high boulder, looking down on us from above. I was able to grab a picture of him with a goofy grin on his face.
Our next checkpoint was the Jerry Cabin Shelter, 10 miles in, where we'd stop for lunch. As Toepick and I jammed in some food and water, Odin slept in a little ball on the ground. The remainder of the day was similar to the first half: more fog, more mud, more trail. I grabbed a picture of the gravestone of Howard C. Bassett who, in 1968, hiked the AT. After his death in 1987, his ashes were placed on this little spot of the trail. We hiked over Big Butt Mountain, too, which is saying something, I guess.
At 5:15pm Toepick, Odin, and me strolled into the Flint Mountain Shelter where most of the same company from last night's shelter were already relaxing, eating, or doing camp chores. Only four people are sharing the shelter tonight which is a nice treat and ensures plenty of wiggle room. Two guys are on one elevated platform, and Toepick and I are on the other, Odin tucked warmly in between us on his sleeping pad. It's just after 7:00pm as I wrap this entry up, and every hiker is already bedded down for the night. It's still light out, and I can just see the top of a mountain we'll have to start up in the morning, standing a few hundred vertical feet overhead. Odin just had a quick dream, his feet running in place.
Although it'll be a cool night, with lows expected to be in the mid-to-upper 30's, I'm fortunate to be dry and warm after a cold and wet day. Having both Toepick and Odin between me and the shelter entrance, aka any visiting bears, is also a rather comforting thought. Until tomorrow.","Hemlock Hollow Inn & Paint Creek Cafe, TN

I woke this morning to another cold, foggy, and wet morning. It wasn't raining, but the plop...plop...plop of water hitting the ground from the overhead trees filled the otherwise silent air. I quickly had my gear packed, cashed a check in the tiny privy on site, and, with Toepick still in her sleeping bag, I told I was going to hike on at my own pace today. With the terrain profile showing mainly inclines for the day, we decided to shoot for the same ending location, but otherwise do our own thing in between.
At 8:45am I headed out, saying bye to Toepick and Odin, still on his sleeping pad, and headed off. The rain from the previous day messed up my iPod and I was unable to listen to music for the first several hours. It didn't get wet exactly, but the touchscreen wouldn't register my finger, preventing me from both accessing music and turning it off. I figured it'd just run til it died. The first three miles of trail were flat or gradual inclines/declines, and the going was quick and easy. Four older gentleman who stayed at the shelter with us left half an hour to an hour before me, and I would gradually catch them as the morning unfolded.
After crossing over a road, the trail went up and rounded it's way uphill through someone's green pasture. Within another mile I entered a valley with a creek running down the center of it, gradually going higher and further up the valley, disappearing in the dense fog that defined the morning. A couple roosters called as I walked through the woods behind people's homes. An old cemetery sat at the crest of a small hill, a small black fence surrounding two headstones, a light green moss covering one of them. Although a small creek, the water rushed down quickly, climaxing in a ~20ft waterfall, or series of small cascades, about halfway up the valley. I spent a few minutes watching the water tumble over and pass beneath the small rocks I was standing on before returning to climbing.
As I reached the back end of the valley, a large wall of earth rose higher into the fog above. I remembered this section, and knew I'd have to climb until I began walking along an old barbed wire fence which would tell me I was nearing the summit of Lick Rock Mountain. Eventually the fence came into view, often times being my only guide as the trail ran parallel with it, disappearing into the fog ahead. I reached Hogback Ridge Gap Shelter around noon, about seven miles into the day. Having covered that distance in just over three hours, I treated myself to a ~40 minute lunch break. As I was slowly packing up, a hiker I was with said that Scarecrow, a hiker ahead of, texted him off trail magic about three miles ahead where I-26 passes through Sam's Gap. That was all I needed to kick it back into gear. As I took off, I sent up a quick prayer, asking for nothing more than the sun to appear today. I imagined it shooting up into the abyss like one of those tubes at the bank, and landing in the to-do pile.
Forty minutes later, I had covered the 2.7 miles into the gap and, as I exited the woods, noticed a handwritten sign advertising trail magic to my left, up a 45-degree angled street. From my angle, I could see a truck parked, but no activity around it. Not knowing if the sign was old, from earlier this morning...yesterday...last year, I decided it was worth a quick climb to look. Parked next to a small cemetery near the crest of the hill was Scarecrow and Tin Man (the names being a coincidence) and a trail angel, Quiet Paul, busy scrambling eggs and cooking potatoes, a mixture between hashbrowns and German potatoes. I quickly joined them, a Coke acquired from a cooler nearby, and waited as he cooked up my healthy portion of eggs. Toepick arrived within minutes and caught me by surprised for I figured she'd be a couple hours behind me all day. With my earlier lunch and her running through the downhills, she had been able to close the gap and catch me. She joined me and we were soon enjoying eggs and potatoes together. Quiet Paul even scrambled up four eggs for Odin, the way he likes them. As we sat and enjoyed this unexpected treat, the sun appeared for the first time in over two days, and would shine strong and beautiful for the rest of the day.
Feeling content with our eggs and potatoes, we made our way down the steep incline, passing under I-26 in the process, where we met Mrs. Scarecrow, Scarecrow's wife, doing her own version of trail magic. We soon collapsed on the ground along their car and were offered PB&J sandwiches, Oreo's, chips, fruit, and a variety of sodas. Although they were Pepsi drinkers - no one's perfect - I wasn't picky today and happily enjoyed my second soda. We chatted for a while about a variety of things. I told Scarecrow he should look up Negan from The Walking Dead. I'm telling ya, give the guy a wooden baseball bat with some barbed wire around it and a couple skulls to smash, and he's a close second. If the afternoon couldn't get any better, a vehicle soon pulled up across the street and began unloading coolers and bags of food.
Enter Steven and Sheron from nearby Asheville, NC. Steve came over and offered their trail magic. Not wanting to be rude to the Scarecrow's, I figured I'd at least saunter over and check on the Coke availability. Steven quickly had a store-brand Coke in my hand, and Sheron followed right after with a sandwich she had already made. The bread was soft - something a good friend has gradually helped me appreciate - the turkey was rich, the lettuce crisp, the tomato juicy, and cheese cheesy, and the mayo Duke's. The Duke's mayo really took the sandwich to another level. So much so that I had to have a second. A third would follow not long after. I'd also have some chips, cookies, a second soda, and would pack out a third soda, chips, and three cuties as I left.
Not to get ahead of myself, Toepick, Odin, and me wouldn't leave the company of Steven and Sheron for close to three hours. We sat in their camping chairs along the side of the road, a stone's throw from the humming vehicles on I-26, and got lost in good conversation. From sports, to math, to geography trivia, to hiking, to bumper stickers, to movie quotes, we covered the basics of a little of life's essentials. We thanked them several times over, and although Steven said we were the ones busting our asses each day, Toepick countered and summed it up best with: Although we're hiking, we're hiking for ourselves. You give for others. They had us each sign their register they've had ever since they began helping hikers a couple years ago. I briefly flipped to 2015 and saw that Rock Boat had enjoyed some of Sheron's famous banana pudding. Small world. Steven and Sheron, wherever y'all are tonight, it was a genuine and perfect way to spend a few hours with y'all. I'll enjoy the soda, chips, and cuties tomorrow. For now, here's to y'all.
A little after 5pm, Steven and Sheron had to leave. Although we were their only real visitors on the day, a few other hikers already stuffed from the other two trail magic sessions quickly grabbing a snack and moving on, they both agreed I now hold their record for the most consumed by a single hiker. Guys, it's an honor. Toepick and I decided to cut our 18-mile goal down to around 14, and make it to a campsite in around four miles, just before 7pm. With eggs, potatoes, two bags of chips, cookies, Oreo's, a Gatorade, three sandwiches, and four sodas consumed, I loosened my belt buckle, threw on my pack, and head back into the mountains with Toepick and Odin, the thoughts of how perfect an afternoon it had been. To make things better, my iPod began working again so I was able to listen to music again and get lost in my food coma-induced thoughts.
We soon reached a large meadow, overlooking Big Bald and a row of houses dotting the ridge to the east. All the homes were a reminder that we're not always as ""out there"" as we sometimes feel. I commented to Toepick that Big Bald, Erwin's version of Hot Spring's Max Patch, looked awfully close. At six trail miles from our current location, it was a bit more than we planned to do before nightfall, but we'd keep the option open. After four miles we reached Low Gap and checked the guide. It was 6:45pm and it was still 2.7 miles to the summit. With beautiful, clear skies,I wanted a sunset at the summit. With a pretty rigorous climb, I didn't know if it was possible, but was game to try. Toepick agreed, and, after telling her I'd stop at the summit, off I went at my own pace.
The trail seemed to meander in every direction other than where the summit loomed overhead. I covered the first half of the stretch quickly, but eventually tired over the last mile as the terrain grew steeper and more rugged. I felt like I could see the shadow of sunset out of the corners of my eyes, telling me to give it up. The shadows of trees grew longer, and the mountainside turned a dark orange, hinting that my time was about up. I began jogging during one flat stretch, spooking a deer in the process, before I reached the final push below the grassy summit. My legs reached the jello-like feeling for the first time out here and, had Bill Cosby stuck a spoon in them, I would've been done. I powered on until I left the trees behind and only grass was ahead of me as I circled my way to the summit.
I reached the summit with ~10 minutes to spare, and my legs grew week either from having just busted out the climb, or the view before me. I've seen sunsets through Mississippi pines, over the flat wheat fields of Kansas, through Indiana corn, behind city skylines while drinking a beer, but tonight was one of the best. I stood alone atop Big Bald, knowing I was the only one seeing the sunset from this particular spot. I don't have the words to describe how good I felt, nor will my eventually pictures due it justice, but the few minutes I had alone were special. It was a damn near perfect day.
After standing atop the exposed bald for half an hour, it began to grow dark and the wind had me nearly frozen. I decided to head up the trail in order to find a place to camp outside of the wind. It took me longer than I'd hoped, for the north side of the mountain was too steep, causing me to continue up another bald a couple hundred vertical feet lower. As I neared the crest of the other bald, I turned back to see Toepick's silhouette atop Big Bald. I waved my headlamp in her direction to show her where I was going, and hope she'd follow me and understand I was trying to find a place sheltered from the wind. It'd take close to half a mile later, but I'd find us a nice spot out of the wind, the wind blowing over the small trees above us instead. While she stood atop Big Bald, seeing me waving my headlamp over a quarter-mile ahead of her, I'm sure she had a string of words together, but all I could hear over the howling wind was ""Dumbass!"" Well, it was almost a damn near perfect day at least.","Flint Mountain Shelter, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624666,"Day 26: Big Stamp, TN to Erwin, TN - 17.4 miles:
Up and shuffling in my tent just before 7am, I was set on covering the ~17.5 miles into Erwin, TN. Toepick quickly packed up in silence and hit the trail as I was folding up my tent. I found a spot slightly downhill from where I camped, among a field of large boulders, and dropped out all the trail magic from the previous afternoon into a nice little cat-hole. By 7:45am I was on the trail and heading on. Within a couple hundred yards, the trail opened up as I crossed a small grassy bald, offering my last grand view until I neared Erwin in the afternoon. To the east the sun was in the process of transitioning from orange to a bright yellow, lighting up a cloudless sky. A thick fog hung low in the valley below like a lake of clouds, a few of the tallest mountains rising out like thick tree-covered islands.
The first several miles would consist of two sharp declines that, by looking at the guide, had me worried for my knees. However, I'd quickly find they weren't as dramatic as the guide suggested, making the going easy. The first seven miles passed quickly as I zoned out, listened to music, and enjoyed the occasional view of the cloud-lake. A couple hours later I reached a small stream and stopped to drink half a liter and top of my water bottles. As I did so, I heard a familiar voice drifting over from a nearby road. As I crested a small hill up to the road, I saw the back of Tank standing in a small group with a table and camping chairs, the tell-tale sign of trail magic. I approached and introduced myself to Bear Bags, a 2016 thru-hiker, and his wife Mrs. Bags, along with their dog Porkchop. For the next hour and a half I would slowly slip into a late morning food coma, my second in the last 12 hours.
Bear Bags will begin culinary school this upcoming Fall. Today, I was able to enjoy a simple meal prepared with talent and love only an aspiring chef can create. With a hot plate consisting of potatoes, green peppers, onions, and ground beef in one hand, and an ice cold Yuengling in the other, I knew I would remain firmly planted in my chair for the immediate future. With the sun shining down and warming my skin, I would chat with Tank, Tin Man, Moonshine, Space Jam, and the Bags' as bagels with cream cheese, chips, and donuts were passed around freely. Toepick and Odin would also arrive and would enjoy their share of magic as well. After receiving a little food himself, Odin would fall asleep on the ground next to my chair.
With it already nearing noon and still having 11 miles to cover, I motivated myself to return to the trail. With a full belly tossing with potatoes and beer, sweat dripped from my eyelids as I huffed my way up and out of the gap. Passing Tank, Toepick, Moonshine, and Space Jam in the process, the miles passed quickly as the trail remained relatively flat as it meandered in and out of valleys along the long ridge line leading down into Erwin. The sun beat down on me as I wandered my way around mountains, occasionally passing through darkened tunnels of rhododendrons, momentarily finding relief in their shade. Just over an hour and a half later I reached No Business Knob Shelter where I treated myself to a 10-minute water break after making good time. As the only one who could maintain my speed, Space Jam and I chatted a bit before continuing on together.
With six miles remaining, we crushed them out, stopping only once to enjoy one of my favorite views on the trail. Within two miles of Erwin, a small edge of the ridge offers a view of the mountains above, a rushing river below, and the towns of Erwin and Unicoi spread across the valley floor below. Two years ago Safari took one of my favorite pictures of the trail, with me sitting atop a small pine tree on the edge of a cliff, at this spot. I was happy to see the tree was still standing, and has not yet toppled over the edge. With no hikers around to take my picture in the tree again, I simply grabbed a shot of the tree and view, moving on quickly down the mountain afterward. Within 20 minutes I was exiting the woods and strolling up to Uncle Johnny's Hostel. At 3:15pm, it was a good feeling knowing I had crushed out just shy of 18 miles in seven and a half hours, less time when counting the time spent at the trail magic.
After speaking with the hostel caretaker, I reserved the last cabin, basically a small room with a bunk bed, small TV that plays only VHS tapes, a microwave, and a mini fridge. Unsure if Toepick planned to stay at the hostel, I reserved it anyway since dogs weren't allowed to stay in the bunkhouse. I threw my gear in the small room and immediately went to take a hot shower in a separate shower house. With nothing more than a bottle of conditioner and a used bar of soap, I made it work. I spent the next hour sitting in a swing on the front porch, occasionally petting a dog of unknown age, but assumed to be approximately 15-17 years old, named Jerry Garcia. Having previously hiked the AT himself, he has since been a fixture at the hostel and can be found sleeping on an old dirty couch each night in the bunkhouse. I can currently see him from my top bunk position, his legs sprawled across the couch and some hiker's pack.
When Toepick, Odin, and Tank arrived, I showed them to the small cabin and we decided to go in on it together. However, later in the evening the caretaker told Tank he'd have to leave and go to the bunkhouse since three adults and a dog in one little cabin is a little much. There's a reason this trail is also known as the nickle-and-dime trail. Not wanting to make Tank leave, I packed up my gear and would join the other hikers in the bunkhouse instead, leaving the two of them and Odin to enjoy the comfier confines of the small room. I was pretty set on enjoying Camp Nowhere on VHS, so I'm pretty bummed out about that.
Between 5:30pm-8pm, a group of hikers were shuttled into Unicoi to eat dinner at one of two places, a Mexican or Italian restaurant, and resupply at a Walmart. Everyone chose to eat Mexican. As a dozen or so of us sat around a few tables, NASCAR playing in the background, the banter grew louder, especially when the alcohol arrived. I zoned out, unable to focus or take much interest in any one conversation so, after downing two glasses of Coke, I put down a $5 bill and left, walking over to Walmart instead. I'd roam every aisle, looking for something new to try on the trail, but ultimately failing in the process. Needing enough food for five or six days, I purchased what seems like a ridiculously heavy amount of food - candy bars, beef jerky, beef sticks, breakfast bars, tuna, as well as a bag of kettle chips and saltine crackers to snack on later.
At 8pm, with the last of the day's light fading behind the mountains in the west, we were shuttled back to the hostel, singing along to Elton John's Tiny Dancer and Rocket Man in the process. It's now nearing 11pm - some hikers are sleeping or attempting to, and others are outside drinking beer and chatting loudly. A moth repeatedly bounces off a light near my head. Jerry Garcia just moved and resettled himself on his couch, his first movement in over an hour. Tin Man is on his phone in the top bunk across from me, most likely fed up with the crappy WiFi signal. Tank is outside telling stories, dropping plenty of f-bombs in the process.
The weather tomorrow calls for rain all day, and the next week in general seems poor - more rain and even a chance of snow. Not again. Depending how the weather is in the morning, I will be considering another zero, as are several hikers. Time will tell. For now, I'll wrap this entry up and hope none of the 10 hikers sharing this room snore. It's good to have dreams.","Big Stamp, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624667,"Day 27: Erwin, TN - 0.0 miles:
Last night brought a rough night of trying to sleep, a battle I would ultimately lose. The bunkhouse grew increasingly hotter; stripping my layers off and lying on my bunk with no sleeping back didn't even work. At 4am, worried my tossing was keeping others up, I took my sleeping bag onto the outdoor patio and curled up in a hammock. I drifted in and out of sleep over the next three hours, a light breeze gently rocking me, and the sound of the Nolichucky River filling the air. I woke just after sunrise in order to really do nothing other than relax for the day.
At 8:30am half a dozen or so hikers climbed into a shuttle and were taken to a Huddle House for breakfast - three eggs, hash browns, bacon, grits, and toast for me. Toepick, Tank, and Sugar enjoyed their own version of a perfect breakfast; Tin Man sat alone at the counter top. After downing breakfast I waddled over next door to a gas station and got me a 32oz of Pepsi in hopes it'd last me a while. Polishing it off during the short ride back to the hostel, I would get another can of Pepsi from a vending machine and finally feel satisfied.
The remainder of the morning and afternoon hours were spent being lazy and doing the least amount of physical activity as possible. I mainly hung with Toepick, Odin, and Tank in their private cabin as a way to escape the endless trail banter that takes place in the bunk house. By early afternoon the clouds finally opened up, unleashing a torrent of hard, fat, cold rain that would remain until late afternoon. A few cold, soaked hikers would stumble in during this time, looking miserable and wanting nothing more than a warm bed. The hostel was quickly at capacity, and several of the hikers would have to tent or hammock camp on the property, paying $17.50 to do so, of course. As the rain fell, the three of us passed an hour playing a phone app version of Heads Up Charades. Odin slept silently on the bed nearby, having practically not moved since arriving at the hostel yesterday evening.
I escaped to enjoy another shower, going through the routine of a shower twice - shampoo, rinse, conditioner, rinse, soap, rinse, repeat. The hiker smell is almost permanent and won't begin to fade for at least a week or two of normal bathing post-hike. I mentally feel clean, though, and that's what's important. At 5:30pm nearly two dozen hikers squeezed into two shuttles and made our way back into Erwin, the same routine each night, to Walmart and your selection of Mexican or Italian for dinner. At least half of the bunch chose Italian this time, and we'd all cram into two tables. Fried cheese sticks, garlic knots, garlic bread, massive stromboli's, pizza, salad, and a variety of pasta flowed between hikers.
Upon completion of dinner, I sauntered over to Walmart with an hour to kill, but with nothing needed. I mindlessly wandered almost every aisle, looking at food I couldn't carry with me on trail and, unfortunately, the pathetic food I'm forced to carry. I checked out the colorful flowers of the outdoor center, still a few weeks away from noticing any real color changes at the higher elevations. A small Trolls balloon with Poppie, Creek, and Guy Diamond sat at the end of an aisle. I thought it'd be fun to strap one to my pack, but couldn't justify the weight-to-laugh ratio. Eventually the hour passed and we returned to he hostel just before nightfall.
Tomorrow brings a return to the trail despite potentially crumby weather, both tomorrow and the week ahead. Tomorrow is all uphill as I'll climb out of Erwin and eventually enter the Roan Highlands area of northeast Tennessee. Shelters are only located at four and 17 miles in, so I'll either need to shoot for the 17 or end up camping somewhere in between. With enough food to comfortably last me five or six days, my legs will most definitely feel the burn that follows a zero, but I will find my groove soon enough. Toepick is tentatively planning to get a late start and only cover four miles to the first shelter so our hiking days together are most likely over. If so, I will miss her company, and especially the love from my moon-howling-buddy-in-arms, Odin. Just over 200 miles remaining for me.","Uncle Johnny's Hostel (Erwin, TN)

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624668,"Day 28: Erwin, TN to Iron Mountain Gap, TN - 20.2 miles:
At 10pm last night, standing in the bunkhouse of Uncle Johnny's, a handful of hikers listening to music, reading, or chatting, I knew I wouldn't be able to get a good night's sleep just like the prior night. With Toepick more or less confirming we were done hiking together, there was no reason for me to wait until the next day to get moving. Having told her and Odin bye an hour before, I decided to pack up my gear and cover four miles to the next shelter where I hoped few hikers would be, and I might get some sleep as a result. At 10:30pm I set out into the night, the light of my headlamp illuminating the trail before me. The four miles would pass quickly as adrenaline coursed through my body. Had it not been for the roaring Nolichucky River, running parallel with the AT for close to half the distance to the shelter, I probably would've heard it running through my veins.
With sweat dripping from my forehead and my breath turning into fog as I panted my way uphill, I reached Curley Maple Gap Shelter just as my watch hit midnight. I quickly shined my light into the shelter and found two hikers sleeping, looking like fat grubs inside their sleeping bags. I made my way about 50ft away from the shelter to unpack what I'd need for sleeping in the shelter, hoping the distance would prevent them from hearing me. However, as I returned to the shelter and attempted to hang my pack on a chord hanging from the ceiling, it snapped and made a loud thunk noise. Fail. One of the hikers woke up, but didn't seem upset, and bkefly chatted with me - who I was, where I came from, weather forecast, etc.. Within a few minutes I was lying in my sleeping bag, my body covered in sweat, trying to shelter from the coolness of the night beginning to set in. Although I would only get close to six hours of sleep, it was deep enough to leave me feeling refreshed when I woke at 7am. After a sloppy morning deuce, due to the Italian food from the previous evening, I was back on the trail by 7:45am.
Although it rained a little during the early morning hours, the morning was partly cloudy, and would gradually transition into a sunny, clear day as the day rolled along. As I reached Beauty Spot, an exposed ridge of short grass and few trees, I exchanged a few jabbing comments with Scarecrow, Stitch, and Smiles as they were calmly slack-packing south. Scarecrow asked why I was sweating so much, lightly punching me in the shoulder as he passed. I grabbed a few pictures of the surrounding mountains along the exposed ridge, but the cold wind forced me to continue on into the trees despite the sunny sky. The trail would then skirt along Red Fork Road before beginning its rise up Unaka Mountain, the high point of the day. Close to two-thirds of the way up, as I neared the spruce forest atop the summit, I stumbled across one decorated just off the trail. A family commemorates a loved one who died in his early 20's by decorating a spruce tree with a variety of colorful ornaments. With the smell of Christmas filling the air, it seemed to fit.
A few hundred yards later after passing through the thickest stretch of spruce forest, the sun almost blocked out entirely, I found a small patch of soft grass where the sun found its way through. I sat in the small patch of warmth, the wind gently blowing through the spruce trees overhead, but blocked down low where I sat, and rested as I ate lunch. The only thing that ruined the moment was the thought and taste of the crap I once again had to shove in for calories - tuna, beef sticks, beef jerky, M&M's, and a Cliff Bar. With only three miles to go before I'd reach Cherry Gap Shelter, my goal of 17 miles for the day, I was entertaining the idea of getting their early, posting up in the sun, and passing the day away by reading or snoozing. However, as I reached the shelter in what seemed no time at all, my legs felt good and I chose to continue on.
Around an hour later as I approached Iron Mountain Gap, I met a man named Doug, aka ""Hiker Finder"", who, like his name suggests, was walking up the trail to see if he could find any hikers. He told me there was trail magic up ahead so I gladly slowed my pace, fully prepared to enjoy some unexpected treats. When I reached the road, I noticed a white van that Robert Bird has become known for. A large Casper decal adorns each side, along with the words ""The friendly AT van"". They opened the back of the van which housed a carpeted floor and full couch, along with lawn chairs, and a couple coolers. I was given a Coke, a hard-boiled egg with salt, and told to sit in one of the chairs and relax. As I did we delved a little into sports, politics, and the trail. Other than another hiker, Hawkeye, who was slack-packing another four miles to the Greasy Creek Friendly, I told Rob and Doug I'd be the only one passing that point today.
Rob would go on to tell me of his history with owning/running a hostel in Massachusetts, known as the Bird Cage, for a dozen years before closing his doors in 2012 and moving to Unicoi, TN in order to be around the AT. Since then he has regularly provided trail magic in a series of road-crossings, occasionally inviting hikers to stay at his place, grab a hot shower, and enjoy some real food. The best thing about it? It only costs a little work around his home and some conversation. With my plans for the remainder of the after still up in the air, but having already passed my goal for the day, I told him if his offer was available to me, I'd gladly accept. Soon enough I was sitting on the couch in the back of the van as we dropped out of the mountains into Unicoi.
Rob welcomed me into his home and has made me feel like family as soon as I entered. Upon entering, I noticed an entire wall devoted to the AT - summit pictures and dozens of hiker pictures and thank-you notes he's held on to over the years. He also told me he is a quarter Native American which helped explain the Native American decor seen in almost every direction - plates, dream-catchers, pictures, statues, and the like. I was able to enjoy a hot shower, given some clothes to lounge in, and a cold PBR. To hold up my end of the bargain, I cleaned all of his windows, something done last Spring by another hiker. We chatted the afternoon away before heading into Unicoi to enjoy dinner at a local diner. I enjoyed a half-pound burger, curly fries, and a tub of Coke; Rob enjoyed a club sandwich and fries. He also picked up the ticket which was beyond unnecessary, but greatly appreciated.
We've since returned to his home where he currently sits flipping between Fox News and wrestling. I'm mindlessly watching as I sit next to him on his couch, journaling. It may or may not be biting off more than I can chew, given the terrain, but tomorrow, with the help of Rob, I will be shooting for 30 miles up and over the Roan Highlands. He will help by taking me north to Highway 19 where I will then slack-pack 30 miles south back to the gap I met him in today. He'll pick me up and house me again tomorrow evening. The thought of having another place to stay after what should be a rainy day will hopefully be the motivation I need to cover the distance needed. Two years ago I hiked 23 of those miles in one day which ended up with me nearly freezing in a hailstorm atop one of the several exposed balds. It's doable, but will definitely be a head-down-and-go kinda day. The Roan Highlands are no joke, with Roan Mountain being the final 6,000-footer until hikers reach the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
For now, it's nearing 10pm and sleep is calling me. Hoping to be on the trail by 6:30-7am in order to get the miles in. Tomorrow may bring a lot of rain and sweat, but tonight my belly is full and a soft bed awaits.","Uncle Johnny's Hostel (Erwin, TN)

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624669,"Day 29. US 19E, TN to Iron Mountain Gap, TN - 30.8 miles:
Mr. Bird knocked on the bedroom door at 5:30am to make sure I was awake. I slept half the night, but had been tossing since early morning and was anticipating the alarm clock. I joined Mr. Bird at his small wooden kitchen table where we sipped on hot cups of coffee. I also downed a bagel and honey bun despite not feeling particularly hungry. With the sky still dark, a small sliver of light just forming in the east, we made our way some ~45 minutes to the AT trail-head at US 19E, about halfway between Roan Mountain, TN and Elk Park, NC. At 7:15am, Mr. Bird dropped me off at the trail-head, and told me to do my best maintaining 3mph all day so we'd have time to drive into Johnson City, TN tonight to enjoy all-you-can-eat wings at Hooters. I set off carrying no more than 5lbs - a nano puff jacket, two pairs of socks, a beanie, a balaclava, a liter of water, cell phone, camera, iPod, two honey buns, beef jerky, and a pack of a dozen or so fun-sized pieces of chocolate. I could've carried half of what I did, but with potential weather approaching during the day, I choose to be safe with a few extra pieces of warm clothing.
The first five miles led me up into the Roan Highlands, heading south instead of north today, towards Hump Mountain. As the sun broke the horizon to the east, the bright sun like a ball of fire against the blue sky, I knew it was nothing more than a tease. After three miles I reached Doll Flats, a campsite sitting on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, the last time, in fact, NoBo hikers will be in North Carolina. The morning was warm as I passed through a clearing drenched in sunlight, a farm sitting in the valley directly below with two horses munching on grass in a pasture. It was at Doll Flats where, two years ago, I stumbled into camp nearly frozen after a 23-mile day that ended in hiking through a hailstorm atop Hump Mountain, now standing overhead. Putting on all of my layers, immediately passing out in my sleeping bag for a few hours, and a two liter of Coke pulled me out of that difficult experience.
A couple miles later I exited the treeline and on to the exposed grassy ridge that led up to the summit of Hump Mountain, still over half a mile away. I could see a few hikers making their way down in my direction. I also noticed the sky had already taken on a light grey, the sun behind the clouds where it'd remain the rest of the day. As I made my way up and over the summit, I enjoyed the 360-degree views of mountains rising in every direction, the largest being Roan Mountain, its summit still ~12 trail miles away. As I made my way down Hump Mountain, I gradually passed a total of half a dozen hikers slowly climbing their way up and eventually out of the Roan Highlands, their goal to escape the approaching weather. As I made my way into a deep gap between Hump and Little Hump Mountains, I remembered the wind tunnel this gap had been two years ago. As I passed through then, I had been unable to hear my voice even at screaming levels, the force of the wind taking the noise as soon as it left my mouth. Today, however, in the calm morning, the gap remained quiet. I would pass only a few more NoBo hikers during the morning hours, but would remain more or less along in the Highlands until I neared its southern terminus.
Once up and over Little Hump Mountain, I crested a hill and saw the red siding of Over Mountain Shelter, a red barn converted into a large shelter for hikers, sitting in a small clearing at the start of a valley, the valley walls stretching out and away in front of the shelter. Having to maintain speed throughout the day, I had to be picky with where and how I chose to use my limited breaks. I continued on, back into the woods leading up and away behind the shelter towards the south. I soon arrived at and was passing Stan Murray Shelter, sitting empty in the late morning. Some hiker of yesteryear had crossed at Stan and replaced with Bill. Although I found this kinda rude, I would hope whoever the shelter had been dedicated to would've found humor in the situation as well. Continuing on, I was soon hiking up and down the camel hump-like mountains of Grassy Ridge Bald, Jane Bald, and Round Bald, the three of them seemingly blending together to form one giant bald. It was during this stretch that first noticed the wind had picked up, the force of it causing me to walk bent over and at sharp angles to the trail, almost as if it was trying to blow me over and off the mountains.
Around noon, I dropped down into Carver's Gap, escaping the whipping wind, down to a road and parking lot where tourists and day/weekend hikers park before setting off. With the summit of Roan Mountain now just under two trail miles away, the mountain rose like a great wall before me, the detail of its features becoming clearer with each step. A sign along the road told me I had come 14.8 miles so far, but had 16 remaining on the day. Having kept pace for half the day, I decided to duck right back into the woods and begin the climb versus dropping in the parking lot to search for trail magic that most likely wasn't there on a day like today. With grey clouds building towards the south, shrouding mountains in a grey haze in the process, I could tell my time was running out. After ~20 minutes of well-graded switchbacks up the north side of Roan Mountain, I reached the blue-blazed trail leading up to the Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT, still hidden from view by a thick wall of spruce trees. With no real desire to stop for lunch, I decided used to push on instead, making my way towards the steeper, south side of the mountain. I didn't quite remember, but was soon reminded, that Roan Mountain must be the lovechild of the two people who created switchbacks.
Just under three miles south of and below the summit, I came across Bubbles who I had gotten to know a little as we chatted and helped with a couple chores together at Uncle Johnny's Hostel. We briefly caught up and, after telling me she was potentially juggling options in regards to getting off trail tomorrow should weather arrive, I passed along Mr. Bird's phone number and suggested she give him a call if she needed anything. She gave me a sour apple sucker as we parted. Just as we were ending our chat, the rain began to fall. Several minutes later a loud thunder rumbles overhead and echoed through the mountains. The rain, though lighter, would fall for the better part of an hour, but the increased winds whipping along Roan Mountain would quickly dry me off afterwards.
I eventually climbed up and over a much smaller mountain, Little Rock Knob, and reached Clyde Smith Shelter. I sat on the ground at the blue-blazed trail leading to the shelter, allowing myself to rest since I knew I was good on time. Knowing I only had six miles remaining until I returned to Iron Mountain Gap, I texted Mr. Bird to inform him I'd be there by 5pm. I drank a little water, having only downed a liter over the first 25 miles, and ate two fun-sized Almond Joy's, my only food for the day. Two miles later I reached Greasy Creek Gap where a side trail leads half a mile off to the Greasy Creek Friendly. I remember staying there with Burnsides as he regained his strength from a sickness he had, and spending a lazy afternoon watching Armageddon together.
Now, with only four miles remaining, my body kicked into a quicker gear, knowing that the finish line and a cold soda were nearby. When Unaka Mountain came into view, and then a curve of a road soon after, I knew I was only minutes away. At 4:30pm, having maintained just under a 3.5mph pace for just over nine hours, I strolled back into Iron Mountain Gap and found Mr. Bird sitting in his white van waiting for me. In the back sat Booty who, if you checked out my pictures, is the guitar player atop Max Patch. He will be staying both tonight and tomorrow during a zero. Although this area lucked out with weather today, tomorrow again calls for rain, and much lower temperatures. Booty, a 2016 thru-hiker, plans to skip the ~31 mile section I did today, having already did it last year. He'll instead continue north at US 19E with me on Friday. As I stood at the back of the van downing two hard-boiled eggs and a strawberry-flavored soda, Booty sat on the couch in the back, strumming on his guitar. Mr. Bird, having once been in a band, is quite the guitarist himself and helped give pointers.
We were soon rolling down out of the mountains, Booty softly playing in the back. After hot showers and a change of clothes, we were back in the van heading towards Johnson City, TN. We'd spend the next hour enjoying endless amounts of breasts and thighs - whatever they'd put on our plate. Booty and I got the unlimited boneless wings, and split a pitcher of beer. I ended up downing 31 wings, one for each mile completed, and several handfuls of fries. With bellies stuffed to the max, we waddled back out and into the van to return to Mr. Bird's, both Booty and I nearly falling asleep on the short drive back. Any time you can leave a restaurant feeling full and that you got to first base is a win in my book.
So now it's just after 10:30pm. Booty is lying in a bed next to mine, journaling and messing on his phone, Mr. Bird is in the living room catching up on the pathetic state of our politics, and I'm quickly getting this complete so I can shoot for sleep. Although my feet are sore and my belly large, 51 miles are quickly behind me, the bed is soft, my clothes are currently spinning in the dryer, and tomorrow Booty and I will rest up and prepare for the next stretch.

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624670,"Day 30: Unicoi, TN - 0.0 miles:
After confirming with the Bird last night that we all planned to sleep in tomorrow, both Booty and I were up just after 7am, our bodies too accustomed to waking with the sunrise. The Bird had his coffeemaker set to begin brewing at 7am so we each grabbed a hot cup and sat on the couch to watch the previous day's sports highlights. We'd flip back and forth between sports and a movie, Rush, which, as far as a movie about racing goes, was pretty good. Bird's friend, Doug, would make an early morning appearance, softly knocking on the door, joining us for coffee, and eventually returning to his home across the street as the Bird still slept. At 9am, the Bird joined us, still in his robe, completely content with enjoying a zero day with hikers doing as hikers do - nothing.
We'd eventually finish both the movie and baseball highlights, as both the Bird and Booty are Orioles and Red Sox fans respectively, and would begin on another movie, The Mist. As the movie carried on and the members of the small town began turning on themselves, I lost interest. I spent half an hour using a roller to roll out sore leg muscles and, under the guidance of the Bird, would go through a series of full body stretches to loosen tightened muscles. Afterwards, I asked the Bird to use his laptop to edit and post pictures. The editing process took nearly an hour and a half in which the Bird prepared Booty and I a tasty, filling lunch consisting of a hodgepodge of leftovers and hard-boiled eggs. Upon completion of editing, the process of uploading them to Facebook would take a few slow hours. Fortunately, we were doing nothing - the Bird back to politics on TV and Booty talking on the phone with someone from back home, or strumming on a guitar.
The day would pass quickly, the way a weekend might for someone off work. Although some might view hikers as freely frolicking through the woods in the nude, it's actually quite the opposite. Although we enjoy killer views and unforgettable moments at times, those come after a lot of hard work, often many miles and mundane hours of pain, sweat, hunger, thirst, and chaffed undercarriages. The hours would pass too quickly as I mindlessly watched the sad state of foreign affairs on TV, talked with my mom on the phone, and regularly glanced outside as the wind and rain whipped outside for most of the day, the thermometer outside barely breaking 40 degrees.
Before I knew it the evening had arrived, the last of the gray day beginning to fade. Just after 7pm we braved the cold by climbing into the Casper van to drive into nearby Erwin to grab some Chinese for dinner. We ordered to go and, as the food was being prepared, Booty and I walked the aisles of the small Family Dollar next door. I grabbed a two-liter of Coke, gum, two Snickers bars, and a can of Folgers coffee to replace what Booty and I have consumed so far. Climbing back into the cold van, Booty in front with the Bird and me in back on the couch, we returned to the Bird's home and would enjoy our meals in the warmth of his kitchen.
As it nears 10pm, the Bird remains abreast on foreign affairs, recently updating us on the US unleashing 50+ Tomahawk missiles in Syria, Booty is lying in the fetal position on his bed as he messes on his phone, and I'm curled under the warm Native American print blanket on my bed. Although the weather tentatively calls for dry weather tomorrow, the highs should only just creep into the 40's, easily only in the 30's at higher elevations. The low will most likely be sub-freezing. The Bird has dropped comments trying to get Booty and I to reconsider one more zero to let the cold pass. We simply told him we'd let him know in the morning. With the terrain becoming noticeably more chill as we return to the trail, we're confident we can reach ~20 miles even with starting by 9-10am. We'll most likely be up around 7am or so again and will reassess, making a game time decision then.
For now, as a light rain falls outside, I'm in the warmth of the home of one of the kindest trail angels I've had the pleasure of meeting. Not all hikers are quite as fortunate as Booty and I are tonight, many most surely shivering it out in the mountains, and knowing that reminds me to always appreciate the simple pleasures offered to me. That, Mr. Bird, you can be sure of.","Unicoe, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624671,"Day 31: US 19E to Kincora Hiking Hostel (Hampton, TN) - 24.7 miles:
I was up at 6:55am for an early morning deuce. My watch alarm sounded at 7am as I was sitting on the toilet. After finishing I went and sat at the kitchen table to enjoy a hot cup of coffee. Half an hour later Booty would join me, followed by the Bird at 8am. Doug would return and we'd all enjoy coffee, chat, and Booty and I had some cereal. The morning hours would pass quickly as we more or less lolly gagged and dilly dallied. With the outside thermometer reading 31 degrees, Booty and I juggled the idea of zeroing again for we knew it'd be colder a couple thousand feet higher. However, we knew it'd be a dry and mostly sunny day, and decided we needed to get back on trail.
We climbed into the Bird's can and were standing at the trail-head along US 19E by 11am. As we climbed out of the backdoor, we were greeted by the cold air funneling through the gap. ""Zero...zero...zero"" Booty repeated to himself as he stepped out into the wind. After a quick goodbye to Doug and a couple of hugs with the Bird, I scampered across the road to the trail on the other side, quickly retreating into the woods to pee for what seemed the hundredth time after two cups of coffee, a can of Mt. Dew, and half a liter of water. I would need to stop and pee every 20 minutes or so until close to 4pm. As Booty and I began climbing two miles back into the mountains, my pack felt doubled in weight after cruising two days ago during my 31-mile slack-pack. It would take close to two hours before my pack returned to what felt normal.
Near the top of the first climb, the forest opened up to a few hundred yards of exposed ridge line. Towering above towards the south stood the Roan Highlands, the top halves of the mountains blanketed in white. I crossed paths with hikers who spent the previous day in the mountains, thawing out from rain, hail, and snow. As I stood in the green grass of the exposed ridge, the warm sun on my skin, I stared above at the frozen mountains, feeling good about my decision to slack-pack the stretch to beat the storm.
I'd use Booty as my pace car throughout the day, hanging back 100-200ft so he could still hike his own hike. As we approached Isaac's cemetery, a turkey hidden just off the trail shot up from the brush, the thumping of its wings breaking the otherwise still air. The trail skirts along one end of the cemetery, a chain link fence the only divider. A statue of Jesus, its weathered back to the trail, stood within arm's length of the trail just inside the fence, watching over two graves. We soon walked up upon Sugar and Tin Man, both unsure of their destination for the day, but we'd spend a little time walking together. After suggestions from two passing day hikers, we all took a blue-blazed trail a tenth of a mile to Jones Falls. The crisp, cold water cascaded down a series of large rocks, appearing over the highest ledge some ~100ft above. After grabbing a few pictures, I spent an unnecessary amount of time attempting to climb slick rocks to a higher vantage point, ignoring the signs warning visitors not to climb them. Halfway up, stuck on a slippery ledge, I finally lunged for a lone rhododendron bush, hoping it wouldn't rip out of the rock and send me sliding down. Fortunately it held and as I scurried my way to the flat ground above, Booty and Sugar walked up, having used a side trail I didn't notice. Shit, I thought.
Booty, Sugar, and me would hike together for a few miles, along a gently flowing river, by the 400-mile point marked by sticks, and along several small streams, babbling softly as we crossed over each. Eventually Booty and I, maintaining a 3mph pace, would pull ahead and not see Sugar until the evening. Using certain points as checkpoints, we'd first reach Mountaineer Falls and Mountaineer Shelter which told us we were a third of the way done. We next reached a park-quality bench placed on the side of the trail, overlooking more snow-capped peaks, as we sat together taking a break. Next it was Hardcore Cascades which, although it was a series of small cascades, was far from hardcore. Onward to Moreland Gap Shelter where, at just under 19 miles in, we knew we had six miles remaining. After a quick break, stretch, and scarfing down a Snickers bar and two fun-sized Almond Joys, my only food for the day, we were quickly back at it in order to escape the wind howling up and directly into the open side of the west-facing shelter.
The final six miles consisted of a few camel humps and ridge running before finally dropping down towards Dennis Cover Road. As we walked, the sun beginning it's final push downwards in the west, I watched Booty walk for close to half an hour with his hands raised to about the height of his shoulders. Onward he walked in this motion. I finally shouted from behind that if he was praying, he should throw in a good word for me. I'm not sure if it was praying he was doing, but, if so, he must've had a lot to say. There's plenty to be thankful for out here after all.
After quickly dropping down into a rocky valley, the trail crisscrossing the valley floor from side to side, the air grew chilly and the light grew darker. The sun shown on the treetops above, but we dropped deeper and deeper into the valley. Eventually the trees thinned and a green pasture appeared. As I rounded a corner, an old barn stood just off the trail, beams of sunlight bleeding through the cracks of the stacked logs. Another couple hundred yards on the trail exits onto Dennis Cove Rd where a white sign on an electric pole advertises Kincora Hiking Hostel a quarter mile up the road. Kincora is the home and hostel of AT legend Bob Peoples. A prominent feature in the AT community for decades, he's been awarded a variety of awards including 2000 Maintainer of the Year and 2016 Silver Service Award for his continued service and maintenance of the trail in this area.
In an old bunkhouse just off the main house, complete with a common area with a couch and two chairs, a full kitchen, and an upstairs loft with a dozen or so bunks, around 10-12 hikers will call it home tonight. Booty and I picked out our bunks, several hostel cats seemingly appearing and disappearing from within the walls, and hit physical and mental comas. As we began to unpack our stuff, we both found ourselves unwilling to move as the exhaustion from the day caught up to us. We eventually grabbed our food bags, went downstairs into the common area, and were about to dive into our crappy food when a guy told us his friend would be happy to run us down the mountain into Hampton, TN. More specifically, there's a McDonald's in Hampton. An hour later four of us crammed into a small car and winded our way down the sharp curves leading into town.
Within half an hour I was enjoying the food coma that comes after downing a Big Mac, two McChickens, a large fry, and a few large Coke's. It was the icing on the cake after a 25-mile day. Upon returning to the hostel, I walked in to find Sugar sitting on a couch slowly shoveling summer sausage into his mouth. I could tell part of his soul died when he heard he had just missed his opportunity to get I on some golden arches. Fortunately tomorrow brings a few options in regards to getting into Hampton, including a side trail that leads hikers just over a mile to McDonald's or Subway. I have a feeling Sugar will be alright. Tomorrow brings a pointless climb up and down a single large mountain before reaching Lake Watauga. After skirting a corner of the lake and crossing a dam, the trail will climb to the top of a ridge, known by a series of names including the Damascus Highway, Tennessee Turnpike, etc for its relative ease leading into Damascus, VA.
Even with a zero yesterday, putting in 75 miles in the past three days of hiking has gotten to my feet. My tentative plan is to back off mileage wise, maybe ~20 miles a day max, but the approaching ridge line might tempt me into more. With only ~125 miles remaining til my tentative exit point, I'm well ahead of my planned ending day and have room to play with. Right now it's just after 11:45pm, I'm sitting on a recliner digesting my food as I wrap up this entry. Booty, Sugar, and three others have been chatting and joking for the past hour and a half. Today marks the completion of a month on the trail, and it's been a good month. Sitting here listening to banter, I find myself thinking of Tennessee whiskey. For now, it may not be the newest, cleanest, or warmest hostel, but tonight it might just be the friendliest.","US 19E

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624672,"Day 32: Kincora Hiking Hostel, TN to Iron Mountain Shelter, TN - 24.5 miles:
Our group didn't shoot for sleep until nearly 1am last night, after both hiker midnight and actual midnight. I climbed into my bed on the bottom of an old worn bunk, happy to have at least scored a wool blanket to lay between myself and the battered mattress. Within a few minutes one of the hostel cats, a light orange one, joined me. It crawled under my sleeping bag and nested next to my hip, softly purring against my right hip. It let me pet him for half an hour or so, tilting and pushing it's head into my hands the way cats do, before disappearing. After a very restful night, though shortened due to staying up late, I woke this morning with the cat again purring at my hip. I assume it returned at some point in the night and I let it back into my bag, but the heaviness of sleep kept me oblivious. When I woke and began moving just after 7:30am, the cat jumped up to the vacant top bunk above me and would sit warming itself in the early morning sunlight until I left just over an hour later. As I was leaving Bob Peoples was just beginning to hand out assignments to volunteers and volunteer hikers alike during a major renovation of the hostel today including the installation of new showers, new wood flooring, and new carpeting. Sugar and Supertramp were still asleep when I left, and Booty stayed behind to help with the renovation, mainly because it involved a free lunch. He was undecided if he was zeroing again, or wouldn't the trail after half a day of work.
I set off into the cold morning alone and would remain so for the majority of the day. After returning to the trail, it gradually dropped into a deep gorge, walls of large sharp-slanted rocks rising above on both sides. The trail turned intonation series of rock scrambles as it dropped deeper, eventually reaching Laurel Falls, one of the nicer falls on the trail. Continuing into the gorge, it briefly narrows to a point where the trail skirts around a rock wall jutting out into the flowing water, the rush of water only a foot or two below and to the side of my feet. The trail continued in the gorge until it reaches a point where the AT cuts right and goes up what appears to be the vertical wall of a mountain, or continues straight as a blue-blazed trail, the distance to US 321 via the blue-blazed trail only being a mile long, nearly five miles shorter than going up and over. However, with the white blaze of the AT leading me to the right, I would begin what appears to be one of the most pointless six miles of trail, literally going up and immediately back down a single mountain. It does offer the first tree-obscured views of Lake Watauga below, but is otherwise very forgettable.
After climbing down the other side, I finally reached US 321 that I knew ran directly in to Hampton, TN. Although I knew most of the terrain today would be relatively chill, the climb over Pond Flats Mountain and the thought of climbing the ridge out of Lake Watauga left me feeling hungry. I soon had my thumb out and in 20 minutes was picked up by an employee of nearby Boots Off Hostel. When he rolled down his window, i immediately noticed his Packers beanie which made him alright in my books without having said a word. When I asked for a lift to McDonald's, he said that's exactly where he was bringing a Sobo hiker who was sitting next to him. Fifteen minutes later the Sobo hiker and I were sitting at a table with breakfast. For me it was a sausage and egg biscuit, a bacon and eggs biscuit, two hash browns, and a Coke. The Sobo hiker, who's name I've forgotten, told me he's been hiking since July 4th of last year, but has been taking his time by visiting a lot of hostels and movie theaters. He guessed he'd be done sometime in May, 10+ months after beginning.
As I finished off my breakfast, my phone and tablet charging in a seat next to me, I stood to throw my trash away and noticed the lunch/dinner menu was now active. My immediate thought was that I'd be doing myself a major disservice by not taking advantage of lunch. I soon had a McChicken, a McDouble, and a large fry. I'd down the McDouble and fries, but would pack out the McChicken to enjoy for dinner later. After spending just over an hour there, I decided I needed to return to the trail and make something of the day, now clear and nearing 60 degrees. With my thumb back out, it'd take just under 15 minutes before a small white pickup pulled over, a young husband, wife, and their child, and happily offered me a ride back to the trail-head. I climbed in the bed of the truck and enjoyed a quick, chilly ride back tongue trail.
The trail would wind its way around several inlets of the small western corner of Watauga Lake, passing Watauga Lake Shelter in the process which seems to regularly be closed due to bear activity in the Spring. I'd quickly pass half a dozen hikers I'd never seen, but that'd be the most I'd see for the rest of the day. I reached Watauga Dam and imagined myself, like two years ago, crossing over it with Burnsides, Moosehead, Safari, and Rock Boat as we were filmed by a drone zipping around overhead. Today, however, I walked along by myself, admiring the lake glistening to one side, Pond Flats Mountain rising up on the far side, and the rockfaces rising on either side of the dam. Knowing I was close to reaching the Damascus Highway, the relatively flat ridge line running from Lake Watauga to Damascus, VA, I powered up the climb to the top, sweat dripping down my forehead and off my eyebrows.
Other than an older woman I'd pass hours later, near the end of my day, the only other hiker I'd see would be Freight Train, a 40-year-old from Texas who I've flip-flopped with since leaving Erwin, TN, but never having really chatted with. He did his best to keep my pace for around half an hour as we chatted and got to know each other's basics, but he ultimately had to back off to his pace, and that'd be it for my day's interaction. Close to 18 miles in I reached Vandeventer Shelter where I took my first break for the day. I spent 15 minutes checking my guide, drinking water, and sitting on a rock outcropping a few feet behind the shelter that offers a solid view of the lake below, and a few large mountains in the distance. A sign posted at the shelter told me I had just under seven miles to reach the next shelter on Iron Mountain. With it only being 3:15pm, I knew I could reach it by 5:30pm so back to the trail I returned.
Just over two hours later I reached the shelter where a NoBo and two Sobo hikers were sitting on a wooden bench, chatting and eating their versions of dinner. I quickly dropped my pack and dug out my cooler, slightly flattened McChicken and was happy with my decision to pack it out. Coupled with a handful of beef jerky, it made for a decent dinner despite not feeling very hungry. Another NoBo hiker would show, bringing tonight's shelter count to five. Two of them, however, are tenting, leaving me ample room to spread out in the six-person shelter. Lying in my sleeping bag and beginning my journal at 6pm, the sun still over an hour and a half away from setting, it'll be a treat to have all my chores completed before nightfall for once. However, I can't win them all, as is evident with one of the hikers in the shelter already in a sleeping coma, snoring loudly for half an hour. I should have known better because the only shelters that don't have at least one snorer is an empty shelter.
I can feel my bones vibrating with each deep, bass-like rumble. Part of my soul dies with each one. I could always go set up my tent 100ft away...make that 200...but I'm too stubborn and physically tired. I'll instead suffer and hate my life through the night. Actually, before dark settles in, I'm going to go find a nice secluded place to dig a cat hole and imagine this guy's face as I release what equals out to be four greasy McDonald's sandwiches. That'll at least help me feel better about the situation.","Kincora Hiking Hostel (Hampton, TN)

The snoring finally got the better of me last night and I caved. At around 1am and without a wink of sleep, the ungodly sound next to me only seemed to get louder with time. In the rare moments that it subsided the girl he was with chimed in with her own unique version of snoring. A third person also joined in, one of the two hikers camping, though it was subtle and at a distance. I crawled out of my sleeping bag, gathered a few things in my arms, and walked ~50 yards up the trail until I found a downed log to cowboy camp next to. I prefer having something to sleep against so I can enjoy the false sense of security it provides from at least one direction. With a nearly full moon lighting the terrain almost as brightly as the day, I was able to move around and settle myself without the help of my headlamp. I fell asleep almost immediately and enjoyed a deep, though not long enough, rest drenched in the moonlight of my last night in Tennessee.
In the morning I returned to the shelter to pack my gear and take care of my morning chores, making sure to make as much noise as possible. Most hiking gear seems to be made with the loudest material known to man so it wasn't a difficult process. I then wandered up the mountainside behind the shelter, returning to my car hole from the previous evening. I dug down until I found last night's massacre and proceeded to add another thick, rich round to it. I'm sure the snoring guy from last night had no idea he was on my mind as I crapped ~30 yards behind the shelter, but oh was he ever. Damn snorers.
I hit the trail at 8am determined to get another 20-25 miles in on the day. The sky was clear and the temperature was already quickly closing in on yesterday's high. My light rain jacket wouldn't last long into the day as the temperature would wise to between 70-75 degrees, sweat pouring freely at times. I reached the monument of Nick Grindstaff, a former resident of the mountain or area I assumed. A little east-facing stone wall with a plaque sits at the head of a concrete grave at the top of a small mountain.
A half a mile later I pulled up and, finding there was cell signal, I sat in the crunchy leaves lining the trail and called my mom. Today is her birthday and I wanted to make sure I was able to touch base early in case I couldn't find signal for the rest of the day. We chatted briefly, exchanging our plans for the day, and that was it. Click. She returning to her birthday breakfast, and me returning to hiking. Once again, though, happy birthday, Mom, love you.
At around five miles in the trail exits the wooded ridge, crosses a quiet road, and meanders its way into a treeless green pasture. Climbing the gradual hill through the pasture, ridges rose in all directions, and the warmth of the morning sun beat down from the brilliant blue sky above. A few hundred yards ahead, just crossing over a small ridge and out of view, was Freight Train. As his name implies, today was his day and, after passing me earlier when I was on the phone, I wouldn't see him in the trail for the rest of the day. I made my way through the pasture and along cow trails beaten into the hillside over the years, but no cows were to be seen.
With miles to put in and relatively tame terrain to do it on, my head was dropped and music was in for most of the day. I'd spend the day winding my way up and down the many camel humps of the ridge leading towards Virginia. Every so often I could see two towering mountains towards the northeast, one with a grassy bald on its southern face, one blanketed in forest. Having covered the stretch a couple of times so far, I knew I'd be covering this stretch a day or two out of Damascus, the forested one being Mt. Rogers, the highest point in Virginia, and just on the other side the Grayson Highlands, my favorite section of the trail.
Other than a quick stop at a small pipe flowing with water just off the trail, I'd average 3mph for the entire day, breaking only at Abingdon Gap Shelter for half an hour to eat lunch. Tired of my food and experiencing my first tunnel vision-like craving for Coke, I pouted on the inside as I shoved beef sticks, a Snicker's bar, and a Cliff bar into my mouth, well beyond them tasting good anymore. After chatting with a hiker that started around two weeks before me, providing tips to him on the approaching section, he went back to smoking pot and me crying on the inside that my food sucked. As I was packing up to leave, three NoBo hikers that were slack-packing, Engine, Caboose, and Jam, arrived. Having passed then earlier in the morning, I had assumed they were day-hikers, but has been moving at a clip that made it difficult to pass. It made sense now they were slacking and so for the remainder of the afternoon, I joined at the pack of their train and used them as my pace care. Jam is Japanese and acquired his name for jamming to music as he hikes. He takes it to another level by using an external speaker and providing music to anyone within ~100ft. His favorite to play when moving uphill is Eye of the Tiger, which he did twice while I was with them.
At 3:30pm we reached the Tennessee-Virginia border, a simple wooden sign standing just off the trail marked the milestone. A previous hiker appropriately wrote ""Jeep Grand"" on another sign informing people they were entering/exiting the Cherokee National Forest. Well played. From this point we had three and half miles to town, and we double-timed it over the final stretch, knowing it was all downhill from this point. We exited the trail between the yards of two homes, reaching Water Street at 4:45pm. With my craving for Coke to it's max, I said goodbye to the other three after a series of photos at a wooden sign welcoming hikers to Damascus, making my way towards the quickest place to get my hands on a Coke -- Dollar General.
A few children played on a jungle gym in a small park, a couple people slowly biked by on the famous Creeper Trail, and cars passed through the quiet downtown strip of town - a far cry from what the town will be like in just over a month from now. Damascus is known as Trail Town, USA for the thousands of people who converge on this sleepy Virginia town every May for Trail Days. All the top vendors, the who's-who of the AT, thru-hikers of every year, all arrive to spend a couple days escaping from the rigors of trail life to enjoy and celebrate in the awesomeness of the AT community. Today, though, it was clearly a typical Sunday afternoon. A lawnmower could be heard several blocks away, a few cars revved their engines as they passed through the small downtown, and a few hikers hobbled around from store-to-outfitter-to-restaurant.
After leaving Dollar General with a plastic bag containing a liter of Coke, a half gallon of OJ, and a can of Sprite, I made my way across the street to Bobo McFarland's, one of the few eateries in town. An hour later after consuming a club sandwich with chips, fries, and at least three refills of Coke, my day-long craving had been met. Now all I wanted was to rest so I made my way to the south side of town to Woodchuck Hostel. As I was signing in and paying for my stay, I saw Freight Train already relaxing in his bed, having beaten me by a couple hours. I grabbed a free bed next to his, one of three in a shared room on the first floor, and we caught up on the day.
We both originally planned to zero tomorrow, but he has since changed his mind and will utilize tomorrow by slack-packing ~20 miles between Damascus and the Grayson Highlands. He asked me to join, but I told him I'd let him know how I felt in the morning. After ~100 miles in the previous four hiking days, my dogs are barking a bit. However, with the opportunity to slack-pack another twenty miles, it might be too good to pass up. TBD in the AM. I also spent a portion of the evening chatting with a thru-hiker from my year who not only proposed to his now wife on McAfee's Knob during the hike, but also created a bun in the oven during the final 100-mile stretch of the trail. Now, as he held his son who conveniently has the initials A.T., he told me how his wife and him try to give back to the trail as much as he can. He will be returning to Trail Days this year as a vendor, selling hand-made wooden statues of the final sign, seen in thousands of summit photos, and will donate a dollar of each purchase to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.
It's now just after 11pm and the hostel is dark and quiet. It took me a while to conclude my journal since I dropped my tablet on the floor earlier, and it now refuses to turn on. I must now journal on my phone, which is made more difficult due to my suffering from sausage fingers syndrome. At least I'm down to my last few. Time for bed. Fingers crossed for no snorers.","Iron Mountain Shelter, TN

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624674,"Day 34: Whitetop Mountain, VA to Damascus, VA - 20.6 miles:
A decent night's sleep due to no snoring from Freight Train or another hiker that shared the room. I would begin tossing just after 5am, though, and eventually wake at 6am when Woodchuck began moving around in the kitchen outside of my door. Freight Train was sitting in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee when I entered. We sat at the table together and were treated to a great breakfast from Woodchuck which included cereal, hard-boiled eggs, bananas, and all-you-can-eat blueberry waffles. As we ate, chatted, and pushed back the sleep, Woodchuck worked away providing an endless flow of fresh, hot blueberries. As 7am approached, Freight Train and I stuffed our few pieces of gear needed for the day in to borrowed slack-packs, loaded into Woodchuck's van, and were heading towards the mountains in the light blue-grey of pre-dawn.
A few minutes before 8am, after winding our way up and just below the summit of Whitetop Mountain, Woodchuck dropped us off on a gravel road where the AT crosses before skirting the summit, dropping down the other side, and again rising towards Mt. [Aaron] Rodgers. We stepped out of the van to a 180-degree view of the mountains of Tennessee to the south, having already hiked over a slice of them to reach this point. We thanked Woodchuck before quickly hitting the trail, nearly 21 miles of trail between me and another Coke in Damascus. We skirted around the mountain, first through an exposed stretch and then back into a light forest. No more than 10 minutes later we exited the cover of the forest into a large grassy bald that covers the southern half of the mountain. We climbed atop an outcropping of rocks, known as Buzzard Rock, and enjoyed a 360-degree view of rolling mountains in one direction, ridges and valleys in the opposite direction, and the forested summit of Whitetop Mountain behind us. Having visited this area a couple times before, I knew it'd be our only real view for the day, before dropping into the valleys and covered mountains below on our way back to town. After a couple of minutes of taking it in, Freight Train and I began making our way down back beneath treeline. Freight Train, like yesterday, had track to lay today and he disappeared from sight in only a couple of minutes, not to be seen again until I reached town hours later.
With music in, I'd quickly find my 3mph pace, the weight of my slack-pack almost unnoticeable, as I worked my way down from Whitetop. It wasn't long before I stumbled across of boy scouts as they say on the side of the trail gulping down water. It was early in the morning, but the temperature was mild and they were heading up the mountain I was cruising down. I spoke with them long enough to learn they were closing in on the halfway point of their 50-mile hike in order.to earn their 50-mile badge.
On the morning would go. Crunch, crunch, crunch of the leaves under foot. Tap, tap, tap of my trekking poles over rocks and roots determine to slow my progress. The sun climbed higher, the temperature grew warmer, and on I hiked. The first change of pace came when I reached the Creeper Trail, the second thing Damascus is known for other than being the home of Trail Days. The Creeper Trail is a ridiculously well-graded biking/running/walking path, running ~30 miles between Whitetop Mountain and Abingdon, VA, following the path of an old railroad, once used to haul lumber from the mountains. The AT essentially becomes part of the Creeper Trail at two points, once just outside the north end of Damascus, and the second time several miles outside of town, where I currently found myself. With the path so flat and free of obstructions, it was difficult to fight the urge of wanting to move faster. Unable to simply keeping moving at my 3mph pace, I picked up my trekking poles and began running. Carrying so little weight, it was nice to lightly run, feeling the new sensations that come with moving quickly. Anything other than slowly lumbering myself up and down mountains under the weight of my normal pack was a nice change. I'd run for close to half a mile before the trail cut back into the woods, continuing its winding and gentle inclines and declines around valleys and creeks.
Continuing on I'd pass two places that brought up found memories. One, a tall stand of thick pines just off the trail was the location of one of my favorite campsites two years ago - cowboy camping in a bed of soft pine needles as the wind cut through the pines above. Spilling my alcohol while cooking and nearly setting my gear on fire also made for a good laugh. The second, within a few miles later, was a small, dark pond where the AT wrapped around it on three sides. I remember Burnsides, Moosehead, Safari, and me trying to bet the other to swim across it, knowing a huge snapping turtle was basking on a downed log nearby. We all failed that day; even though no snapper was present today, I would've failed again if bet.
With just under four miles remaining until reaching Damascus, the last little climb of the day was up and over Iron Mountain. As a mere bump in comparison to other mountains, it would've normally been smooth sailing into town. However, over the last couple days of increased temperatures and more body sweat, my body's salt buildup has equaled chaffing in my buttocks region. I huffed and puffed my way up and over, walking with my legs spread slightly more apart than usual, trying to prevent any additional rubbing than is already necessary for w guy with a bigger butt. At 1:45pm, I exited the woods and returned to the Creeper Trail, running parallel to a creek that'd lead me into Damascus. I made my way directly into a Subway, purchased a Coke, and downed it before refilling it and exiting.
I exited the Subway and made my way across town, returning to the Woodchuck Hostel. On my way back I counted six churches in this small town, two more than the total selection of eateries. A lawnmower purred in the distance of some unseen overgrown yard, shuttle vans zipped by carrying passengers and bikes to/from the Creeper Trail, a few hikers mingled around the small downtown, and I chatted with the only cop I've seen in Damascus as we walked down the sidewalk together. He wished me well on my hike, unknowing to the fact I'll soon be concluding mine, and I asked if I could hold his gun in return. He said no. Joke.
I briefly returned to the hostel to get out of my salt-covered clothes, briefly running them through the sink and hanging them on a close-line to dry. With a sleeveless gray t-shirt being the only thing in my size, I threw it on and returned downtown, back to Bobo McFarland's. I'd sit there in some kind of wasted state, downing another club sandwich, chips, and three Cokes. The lunch atmosphere was quiet, the voices of waitresses and golf on TV the only things passing through the otherwise nearly vacant restaurant. I briefly chatted with my waitress, Bonnie, who also owns one of the hostels in town, the Broken Fiddle Hostel. I swing by after finishing with lunch, only to find four hikers I hadn't met before playing cornhole in the yard. A fifth, a girl, Pudge, sat on the ground watching, a cold beer in her hands. I looked around the hostel and said a quick hello before heading back across town to the hostel I've called home for the previous two days.
When I arrived I saw Freight Train sitting in a wooden rocking chair on the small front porch. I would join him and we'd spend the next couple hours chatting about the trail, football (he's a Cowgirls fan), and making tentative plans for the next few days. He'll be meeting a friend in Marion, VA on Saturday and, like me, can easily put in miles and be well passed there come Saturday. Instead we've decided to take our feet off the pedal, average around ~15 miles a day over the next few days, and end up in Marion together where I'm scheduled to return to Indiana on Monday. As we chatted, we were joined by a couple of Hostel cats, Andy and Fat Cat and a couple of dogs, all looking for a little attention. As the evening set in, Booty returned from the store with an armload of food. Within a couple hours he had prepared a feast that easily fed 10 hikers, asking nothing in return. With a spread consisting of grilled chicken with Ritz crackers sprinkled over, grilled cucumber and squash, broccoli smothered in cheese, salad, and sweet potatoes, the hostel ate very well tonight. As conversation flowed freely and belt buckles were loosened, Booty, Bubbles, Jedi, Freight Train, Woodchuck, and a couple others sat with me in the backyard of the hostel as the surrounding mountains glowed a fiery red as the sun set. With homes being in California, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Texas, we all found happiness on two picnic tables in Damascus, Virginia.
After dinner hikers gradually disappeared to chat or spend time on their electronics, catching up with family, news, etc, but I'd spend the next hour cleaning all the dishes left behind in the kitchen. It was the least I could do to give back. Following a quick shower, I've seen been wrapping up this entry. Booty is asleep in the loft above my room, and either Freight Train or the hiker next to him is in the beginning stages of snoring, but I can't determine which through the darkness. I can say for certain, though, Freight Train has dropped some decent farts, whether he's aware of them or not.
Tomorrow, Freight Train and I will be shuttled back to the top of Whitetop Mountain where we'll continue north. We'll be standing in the Grayson Highlands within a couple hours of starting, my favorite section of the trail. Here's to reaching 500 miles and hopefully attracting some cute wild ponies in the process.","Whitetop Mountain, VA

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624675,"Day 35: Whitetop Mountain, VA to The Scales, VA - 14.9 miles:
I found myself sitting next to a small cascading stream just before exiting the treeline as the trail skirted Mt. Rogers, thinking about how great of a day it was, and of the nice things to come. I dipped my head beneath the clear surface of a small pool of water, letting the rejuvenating water run down my face. As I did so, Freight Train passed by and we'd continue our way towards Grayson Highlands.
Earlier in the morning we had both woke, along with the majority of hikers, at or just after 6am. Another round of breakfast was enjoyed by all. More steaming blueberry pancakes, hot coffee, crisp OJ, sliced bananas, hard-boiled eggs, and cereal. Well, the only person to eat cereal was Booty who made a serious dent in his around-the-world tour of cereals. Having a bowl of each, he successfully downed five or six of the 10 or so offered by Woodchuck. Knowing we only had a relatively chill 15 miles to cover, Freight Train and I relaxed and waited around the hostel until 9am when Woodchuck would shuttle us the ~45 minutes back to the top of Whitetop Mountain. As we waited, Freight Train and I had the opportunity to weigh our packs on an old school scale at the hostel. Freight Train's rang in at 36lbs, and mine a little less at 28lbs. Seeing that my pack held enough food to get me the final four days of my hike, I felt pretty good about the total.
On the way to Whitetop Mountain, Freight Train asked Chuck if he could quickly.pull over so he could pee - it must've been the coffee. This is something I'd expect myself to do, and not 40 year old Freight Train. I held my bladder up the bumpy gravel road of Whitetop and, after a quick and appreciative goodbye to Chuck, was peeing along the trail within a few yards in. Freight Train made his plan clear from the start: the goal would be to not sweat or breathe heavily all day. If we did, we'd slow down. Having pushed big miles over the past week, we both decided to back off and enjoy the next few days. He'll be meeting a friend in Marion, VA on Saturday and I'll be wrapping my journey up then. Although we could've knocked out the distance in two days, we'll instead spread it over four.
Enjoying a pace that hovered around 2mph for most of the day, we were able to enjoy the forests around us, take in the views as they came, and enjoy conversation. We dropped off the north side of Whitetop Mountain, down into Elk Park, a gap with a road followed by a large grassy hill that rises quickly towards Mt. Rogers behind. Normally home to a lot of cows, today the exposed field was empty, save the many cow patties and permanent footpaths created over the years. The sky was big and blue, and the sun shown bright. It was obvious the Grayson Highlands, still a few miles ahead, would be a treat.
As the water ran down my face, it's coolness sending goosebumps down my back, I joined back with Freight Train as we closed in on Mt. Rogers, the highest point in Virginia. As we skirted around the mountain, the trees transitioned into a type of fur, the smell of Christmas blowing through the air. When we reached the blue blazed trail that leads half a mile to the summit, I asked Freight Train if he wanted to go up, despite not having a view. Having decided the AT doesn't cross the high point of each state it passes through, he decided it wouldn't matter too much so on we continued. A couple hundred yards later we passed Thomas Knob Shelter, a lone hiker we didn't know sitting in the doorway.
The trail gradually becomes easier and wider as it passes through Grayson Highlands State Park due to the number of visitors. I peered through the surrounding trees and brush as we hiked, trying to spot any of the wild ponies or steers that roam the highlands, but with no luck. We eventually crested a series of Rocky outcroppings to the top of the plateau-like terrain that is Grayson Highlands. 360-degree views were.enjoyed of the mountains towering in all directions, a series of thin ridges and valleys further into Virginia, and the top of Mt. Rogers rising behind us. As we sat resting in the sun and taking pictures, I spotted a few ponies over a quarter mile away, the flicks of their tails catching the sun just right and making it possible to see in the otherwise rocky, shrub-covered distance. Freight Train decided he would bushwack to them because his wife would've been upset knowing he didn't attempt to get a picture with one.
Off we were across the highlands, off the well-beaten path of the AT, instead following the paths created by the ponies themselves. Over a quarter mile later, through stick-like bushes that stuck and cut our legs, over one stream, and crawling beneath a barbed wire fence, we reached the group of five ponies, well hidden from the site of most hikers. We easily approached a white and reddish one who was far more interested in munching on the moist grass at its feet to care about us. We pet it, took a few pictures with it, and parted ways to get back to our gear we had left back along the trail.
After downing a quick snack and some water, we began hiking through the many outcroppings and dead trees that dotted the area. A young man soon stopped us and, having thru-hiked in 2010 himself, asked if we'd like some cookies. Um.....Of course. We both took two chocolate chip cookies, said thanks, and continued on, now much happier as the taste of chocolate filled out mouths. Soon after, we both successfully fit through a tight path between a series of downed boulders, Fatman Squeeze, which was refreshing seeing as though towns usually have a way of fattening hikers up.
With the sun beating down from a cloudless sky, the temperature easily topped off around 75 degrees which feels hotter when hiking. We gradually dropped off the plateau area, down towards Wise Shelter, nestled in a valley below. As I approached the shelter, I noticed the back end of a pony standing by the open side of a shelter, but couldn't see it's head. As I walked behind the pony and around the shelter, I realized it was simply standing there, slowly shifting its weight on its back legs, but otherwise not moving. After petting it and grabbing a couple pictures, I styled its hair, making it look pretty darn Trump-esque. Freight Train originally planned to stop at this shelter for the day, despite not being 3pm yet, but I suggested he come with me to a much sweeter spot, the scales, only five miles farther. We continued several more miles, chatting about a variety of things, trail related and not. He shared with me that after September 11, 2001, he joined the Navy and would spend several tours in Iraq on a bomb squad diffusing/removing bombs (see the movie, The Hurt Locker, for the general idea.)
We soon stopped at our last water source before the shelter, still a mile and a half away, where I'd continue on while Freight Train filtered his water. Just around a couple corners I stumbled across another half dozen or so ponies, one being a baby. I spent over 20 minutes trying unsuccessfully to play with the baby, but was able to grab a few pictures instead. I then continued up a rocky path in the direction of the AT, determined to cover the final mile and a quarter and be done for the day. Within 100 yards later, I instantly knew I had missed a turnoff and was instead hiking down a gravel road I knew would definitely lead to the stable. However, not wanting to cut trail as much as possible, I cut up and began bushwhacking my way up the side of Stone Mountain where I knew the trail rain along the top.
Twenty minutes later and still no trail. No sign of the trail. A lot of grass, bushes, low trees, another half dozen ponies in the distance, and me standing a few inches deep in a wet bog. Dammit. Such a good day, and now my socks and shoes are soaked. I was too stubborn to bushwhack back down to the road and instead continued following animal paths, heading in every direction at least twice, before finally just catching the silhouette of a hiker as he crested a small ridge a couple hundred yards away. Following the animal trails in the general direction of where the hiker had been ultimately did the trick, and I soon found myself back on the trail descending into the large fenced-in area of the corral. Freight Train, sitting in what little shade a lone sign offered, said he had done the same thing as me and missed the turnoff. He had stuck with the road, though, and had beaten me. Knowing I wasn't the only one made me feel a bit better.
With the sun still out and the air warm, I quickly ditched my shoes for my bare feet in order to let them dry. Within minutes a hiker named Willie, camping in a tent behind his old beat-up Nissan truck and wearing a ""Hiker Trash"" ball cap, asked if we'd like a beer. We quickly made our way over, enjoying the amazing feeling of soft grass beneath our feet, and enjoyed a refreshing PBR as we chatted.
At just before 5pm, we.had plenty of time to find some level ground, set up camp, eat, and chat, all before the sun began setting. As we chatted, stagnant gray clouds formed overhead, dropping an occasional fat drop on us as we sat in the grass outside our tents. The sun was still out and most of the sky blue which made for a cool contrast. It's now nearing 9pm and the world is dark. Freight Train is tossing in his tent nearby, a pony is trotting just outside the corral fence, and creatures of the night are playing their songs. A low rumble of thunder is echoing in the west and could possibly make for a a wet night ahead.
With ~38 miles remaining until Marion, VA, we plan to do a similar, relaxed hike tomorrow of around ~16 miles. We plan to be up and out much earlier than we need to be, but it'll simply allow us more time to cover the miles and/or relax at the end of the day. For now, here's to another epic day in the Grayson Highlands - definitely a stretch of trail I'd recommend to anyone.","Whitetop Mountain, VA

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624676,"Day 36: The Scales, VA to mile 526.2 campsite, VA - 20.5 miles:
I woke last night to the sound of rain plopping against my rain-fly. Fortunately my gear and tent remained dry in the process. The light wind of the early morning also dried off my rain-fly and tent, preventing me from having to carry wet gear for the day. With plans not to begin the trail til 8am, Freight Train and I began slowly moving, packing, eating, and stretching soon after 6:30am. With fog creeping in and masking the distant ridges our elevated position overlooked, slowly at first and then faster, it looked like a bad day ahead. However, with the weather forecast promising sunny skies and highs around 70 degrees again, we knew it was only time.
Pushing out of the Scales right at 8am, we climbed up and over a small ridge blanketed in fog before descended four miles to the Fox Creek below. Immediately after reaching the creek the trail climbed a mile and a half, up and over a small mountain. Once reaching the summit we realized we had covered ground faster than expected, and mentally tried to slow ourselves from that point on. A couple miles later we reached Comers Creek, a series of small cascades flowing briskly beneath a wooden bridge. We joined two women who were doing a small section, taking a break to sunbathe in the sun-drenched rocky banks of the small creek. I dunked my head into the refreshing water, and sat on a rock facing the sun
Freight Train and I chatted with one of the women, Tangle, and her Puggle dog she happened to call Puggle several times. I don't know, maybe his name was Puggle. Freight Train and I both had water from the creek which I later found out the guide book suggests not doing. I guess we'll find out soon enough if that was a bad decision. Seeing as though I haven't filtered any of my water since beginning the trail, I'm not super worried. As we relaxed we drank water from the potentially germ-infested water, Puggle chomped at the air as a Monarch butterfly fluttered by, and Freight Train and I chatted with Tangle. Eventually Freight Train chimed in that we should hit the trail or he'd fall asleep. Back at it we went.
At 2:30pm, even after trying to go at a comfortable pace, we had reached Trimpi Shelter. We sat in the empty shelter discussing the guidebook, both agreeing it was too early to shut it down despite hitting our goal. We decided to continue another three and a half miles to a campsite about a third of the way up a ridge we have to climb in the morning. Continuing on from the shelter, the trail passed along easy terrain including an open pasture, now drenched in the heat of the afternoon sun, offering views of ridges rising behind, the south fork of the Holston River, flowing swiftly and clear, and a super flat one-mile stretch that was like walking along the top of a dam wrapped around the side of a forest-covered ridge.
Soon after I thought I smelled fire smoke, but wasn't confident. Moments later we crested a rise in the trail and saw two gentlemen, out for a few days of hiking, sitting by a fire in the middle of the campsite we were aiming for. Shutting it down after 20.5 miles, it was only 4:30pm, leaving Freight Train and I a little lost at how we did so much without really feeling as though we did. After introducing ourselves to the two gentlemen, I was able to experience how small the world can be.
One of the men, having previously thru-hiked in 1998 and now living in Denver, was from Indy at the time of his hike. The other man, out getting a feel for the trail to see if he'd ever want to entertain the idea of a thru-hike, has been a firefighter in Indy for the past 17 years. He's also cousins with Indianapolis Colts tight end, Jack Doyle, also a former Hilltopper alum who I met once during a homecoming game. The four of us literally sat on the pine needle-covered ground around the fire for two and a half hours rotating between chatting about trail life, or staring silently into the flames the way only a fire makes people do. It was another great day of hiking, and another perfect evening enjoying the opportunity I've had over the past month.
I have no signal tonight to post, and instead will at some point tomorrow. It's currently 7:45pm and everyone is in their tents, having called it an early evening at 7pm. The three others are in their tents on a small rise just above me. One of them, I can tell, is already well into sleep due to the snoring resonating from the inside of his yellow tent. I, on the other hand, am bedded down in a little bowl between two small logs, having decided to cowboy camp and enjoy a beautiful evening which calls for clear skies. There will still be close to 30-45 minutes of daylight once I've concluded this journal, in which I'll quietly lay in my sleeping bag atop a bed of leaves, watching the tops of the pine trees softly sway in the gentle breeze above. The light blue will gradually fade from the sky, only to be replaced by the darkness of night, and I'll have a front row seat.
With only ~18 miles remaining until I'm finished, Freight Train and I will most likely discuss options on how to divvy up the next two days, ending for sure on Friday. If my final miles are anything like the previous few days, I'll be happy. I couldn't have asked for easier miles, more awesome scenery, or better company to finish down the homestretch with.","The Scales, VA
","526.2 campsite, VA","Apr 12, Wed",20.50
Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624677,"Day 37: Mile 526.2 to Chatfield Shelter - 13.2 miles:
After a star-studded night beneath the pines of the campsite, the moon glaring from above like a spotlight, I'd wiggle my way out of my sleeping bag at 7am. Freight Train, in what I assume was an attempt to impress me that he wasn't as old and slow as his 40 years of age suggests, was already nearly halfway packed up. With plans to not break camp til 8am again, we decided the earlier we leave, the slower we could go in order to grab an 11am shuttle into Marion, VA from the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center, only six miles ahead. I downed a small breakfast of two honey buns, knowing real food was in my immediate future, and we were on the trail by 7:30am.
Once again the miles passed swiftly underfoot as we chatted, our legs loosening with every step. Just after 9:30am we reached Partnership Shelter, a two-story beauty complete with a shower sitting a few hundred yards behind the visitor center. With no one around, we quickly checked it out and headed to the visitor center where we'd wait an hour and a half for the shuttle to arrive. During this time I took a deuce, lounged in the mid-morning sun, and chatted with a kind woman named Syliva who volunteered at the visitor center. Freight Train inquired about the possibility of leaving our packs somewhere so we wouldn't have to take them to town with us. She handed him the keys to her van and told us to throw them in the back. I know it sounds like a small gesture, simply throwing your stuff in someone's vehicle, but, to a thru-hiker, having the opportunity to not lug around 25-35lbs is a luxury.
The shuttle arrived at 11:15am and, paying the super reasonable fee of 50 cents a ride, climbed in as the only two passengers. Soon we were winding down the mountain roads into the small though bustling town of Marion, VA. We were dropped in front of Walmart at 11:30am and told simply to be there at 2pm if we wanted to return to the trail. With priorities set with Freight Train, eating being the only thing we wanted, we made our way across the sunbathed parking lot to Sonic. We each had a burger with tots, plus a Coke for me and a shake for him. With it only being 12pm and obvious the meal had simply curbed our hunger, we decided to head down the road to what the shuttle driver described as ""the best restaurant in the county,"" Mi Puerto.
Having become used to the outdoors as our only environment over the past month, we asked to sit on the outdoor patio despite the heat of the sun. Air-conditioning and the endless noise of a busy restaurant becomes a bit overwhelming to hikers over time, and is something they instead must be eased back in to. We sat sprawled out on two chairs a piece, letting the heat of the sun further cook our already bronzed skin. Well, save anything beneath our shirts, pants, shoes, watches, beards, and odd trekking pole strap lines across the top of our hands which remain a no-man's-land of sorts, only seen out of need or by accident. After downing two baskets of chips and salsa, we enjoyed our second lunches, along with more Coke for me and a beer for Freight Train. After finishing we both agreed we were now stuffed, and hiking later this afternoon would either be great with the extra energy, or a complete disaster, though most likely falling somewhere in between.
With food taken care of and it only being 1pm, we walked back towards Walmart, the mission simply to kill time. We walked into Walmart and slowly completed a lap around the store. ""Well, that only took three minutes,"" I said to Freight Train. We tried a new method by buying a couple of things - an iced coffee for us both, plus a Pepsi to pack out for later - and went to sit outside. We spent a few minutes sitting on racks used to display plants before deciding to walk over to Subway to grab a sandwich to pack out for dinner. We slowly crossed the parking lot once again and entered to a long line at Subway. Reaching for my phone to check any messages I may have received, I noticed my phone was nowhere to be found. I said something along the lines of ""shit"" to Freight Train, and headed back over to Walmart. He would buy my sandwich for me - one of his favorites - which I'd later discover was quite tasty.
Returning to Walmart and finding the racks empty, I figured it served me right that it was jacked. I went inside and asked a lady if a phone had been returned. She checked the customer service counter and fortunately it appeared from behind the counter. Whether it was returned by an employee or customer, I silently thanked them in my head. Freight Train returned soon after with our sandwiches, and we still had close to 20 minutes to wait outside for the shuttle.
During this time, however, we were treated to a show you'd expect to see at Walmart. A lady and man, I assume husband and wife, headed into Walmart bickering loudly at one another for a reason no one was able to decipher. A few minutes later they returned outside, the man carrying a 24-pack of Walmart brand Coke (trust me, I know the real stuff when I see it.) They were just behind the first car in the row, blocking what would've been a perfect view, when the man threw down the box of soda, sending them rolling, fizzing, and pouring out in every direction, a young child ducking for cover and the cement quickly becoming stained in its sugary goodness. The couple then returned inside, the Coke still sitting all over the parking lot like the scene in Twister when the sensors are rolling all over the road, before returning with three more 24-packs of soda. A cop car appeared with its lights flashing, the officer quickly exiting his vehicle to speak with the couple. As this happened we began loading onto our newly arrived shuttle, leaving me only to stare out the window in curiosity. Not in regards to what their argument was over, not if one or both of them were going to jail, but instead what a damn shame it was to watch that poor liquid gold slowly evaporating under the intensity of the sun. A damn shame indeed.
We returned to the visitor center by 2:30pm and, after quickly using the bathroom, topping off on water, and packing our food for later, we were back on the trail, our goal being only four or five more miles to a camping spot. The terrain proved easy going, though extremely rocky, over the first four miles, the toughest park being sure not to go too fast so we wouldn't throw up our Mexican food and tots in the heat of the afternoon. Within no time we reached a small forest road, our four-mile checkpoint, and, despite a nice grassy area to camp in just off the road, I insisted we move on another mile, mile and a half to the top of Glade Mountain. Sure, we'd risk not finding a suitable camping spot due to the rocks we'd been clanking over all day, but it'd at least insure us that tomorrow's stretch would be all down hill to I-81. Up we went to the top of Glade Mountain, and on we went along the length of its summit, finding no suitable campsites in the process.
We were soon joined by another hiker, a near lookalike of Andrew Luck, who's name I've forgotten. I asked him if he'd ever been told that before, to which he replied by asking who Andrew Luck was. The poor guy is from Vermont so aside from giving our country maple syrup and beautiful landscapes, there isn't much else going on up there. I showed him a picture and he sorta agreed with me, his only feedback was their noses were a little different. He hiked with us for another mile and a half, talking about his job working for Darn Tough in Vermont, now the best-selling socks for hikers. When we reached Chatfield Shelter near 5:30pm, he wanted to find a place with more campsite options and continued on, but shaking my hand and wishing me well before doing so.
I joined a handful of hikers at a picnic table, enjoyed my spicy Italian sub and Pepsi, and took care of my routine chores. Freight Train did his version of the same before joining in with the conversations as well. Two hikers here are Belgian, another two are American citizens, but have been living in Jordan for the past couple years assisting with Iraqi refugees, and another hiker spent the evening downing seven McDonald's cheeseburgers and an OJ with two small vodka bottles poured in for added flavor.
Just before 8pm we all silently agreed we were tired, making our way to our sleeping quarters for the night. One hiker is under a tarp on a small rise just behind and above the shelter, one is in their tent ~20 yards away, four are in the shelter, and Freight Train and I are cowboy camping just in front and off to the side of the shelter. This is Freight Train's first time cowboy camping. He asked me to walk him through it, being his first time and all, and I insisted he'd like it. Verdict is out til the morning.
Tomorrow brings an easy, almost entirely downhill stretch to I-81 and The Barn, a favorite eatery to hikers that sits just off a side road paralleling the interstate. The group of us here plan to enjoy a breakfast together - what should ultimately be my last meal on the trail. In what has been a good run, my time has quickly come to an end, much quicker than I would have imagined when standing on Springer Mountain in Georgia 36 days ago.
I lowered my phone for a moment as I was journaling, immediately overcome by the vast darkness around me. The stillness. The ceiling of stars twinkling above. The quiet roar of a plane passing to the west, and the silent, majestic flights of three almost unseen satellites skirting across the heavens. Tonight, looking up at the stars, the sound of the October Sky theme song playing quietly from my headphones, I feel as small now as I did as a child. And now, as I type these words, I cry. Not of a broken heart, of failure, or of longing, but a few simple tears in the quiet darkness of a mountainside in southern Virginia. This may not have been a thru-hike, instead a brief return over the first quarter of a trail that will forever hold a special place in my heart. Tears for the trail, for the cold nights and hot days, for the awful food, for the mountains, for the trail angels, for the undeserved kindness, for the many brief friendships, and for Odin. This feeling - it's in the stars, it's in everyone, and it's amazing.
I haven't been hiking against new hikers, I haven't been hiking against weekend warriors or section hikers, and I haven't been hiking against thru-hikers. I've been hiking against time, against the future, against age, and even when you think about it, against ending. And tomorrow, I think I might be able to use these achy old feet just one more time to push the sun back up in the sky and give you one more day of Cambo.
As always, I thank you all for following along, and for the support. I hope you will one more time tomorrow as well.","526.2 campsite, VA

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624678,"Day 38: Chatfield Shelter, VA to I-81, VA - 5.0 miles:
Sleep didn't come easy last night. Not due to lack of comfort or gas, but simply the thought of it being my last night in the woods. Around midnight I finally turned off my music and would begin what has become a typical night of tossing and turning over the past month plus. Removing my glasses, the blanket of stars transitioning into a giant out-of-focus smudge, I'd allow sleep to slowly overtake me as the sounds of a babbling creek flowed nearby.
Freight Train, having been a little hesitant in trying cowboy-camping for the first time, was awake and packing by 6:30am. I immediately asked him how he enjoyed his first time, to which he replied in a positive manner. I'm sure he'll be spending several more tent-less nights on the trail as he continues on his journey. Quickly packing and skipping breakfast since we knew The Barn was only five miles away, we were soon hiking down and through a shaded valley, the sun yet to crest the small mountains above. We'd follow along a shallow creek, crossing over it several times as we continued the gradual descent over the first couple miles. The morning was slightly cool and our fingers were numb as we we gripped our trekking poles, clinking and clanking over the many small rocks that lined the trail.
We soon arrived at the Lindamood School and Settlers Museum, tucked in a small valley along VA 615. The valley was drenched in the early morning sun and we were able to warm up as we entered and approached the old schoolhouse, still standing since the mid-1800's. I knew a local church used the schoolhouse as a trail magic cache and was happy to reach it. Despite being a cool piece of history, my stomach was turning due to skipping breakfast, and I was banking on a cooler of soda. I walked in and glanced behind the door, finding several tubs of items desired by hikers: toiletries galore, snacks, and, as I'd hoped, a cool of cold soda. Freight Train opened the cooler and, floating in water amidst many Pepsi cans was one single can of Coke. I took this as a sign from the AT, a thank you of sorts, for returning and enjoying her for a bit once more.
With only just under three miles remaining, we continued through two small grassy fields before climbing up and over a series of small hills. After reaching the top of the last one, we were treated to a view overlooking a lush green valley, running from southwest to northeast, a steady hum of traffic rising from I-81 below, a large ridge rising on the western side of the valley. We dropped down, admiring what seemed to be perfect farms, what you might expect to see in a calendar. The red wood of a barn standing atop a lush rolling hill, the green of a ridge rising behind, all held together beneath the deep blue of the sky above.
Crossing over the middle fork of the Holston River, we noticed a railroad track, as well as the deep whistle of a train still somewhere out of sight, but gradually growing louder. We reached the railroad tracks, the tracks vibrating and lightly snapping, boxcars rounding a bend several hundred yards away. Within 30 seconds of us crossing the tracks, the train was thundering by, the conductor releasing a few extras blows of the whistle as we stood within a few feet of the tracks. It would take nearly five minutes for the train to completely pass, Freight Train and I gradually climbing a small rise in the opposite side of the tracks in the process.
Within 20 minutes later we were walking into The Barn, a favorite eatery of hikers, sitting on a side road at a junction where the AT crosses over I-81 before continuing up and northward along the opposite ridge. We sat at a booth in the corner of the almost empty restaurant, one thru-hiker the only other customer, finishing up the last of his coffee as we arrived. Minutes later Van Grizzle, the Andrew Luck doppelganger, appeared and I asked him to join us. Freight Train and I enjoyed a similar breakfast of two eggs, two pieces of bacon, two pieces of sausage, two pancakes, grits, and a biscuit.
Complemented with what seemed to be endless amounts of hot coffee, it was an all-around solid conclusion to my brief hike as we chatted, laughed, and thickened up. Van Grizzle was soon back to the trail, while Freight Train called a shuttle drive from Marion whom was recommended to us by two people the day before. Another 15 minutes after placing the call and we were being returned to Marion, VA by Jim Sparks, a kind gentlemen who's called Marion home for 40 years and has been shuttling hikers free of charge for years.
Freight Train and I originally planned to stay at the Economy Lodge, but once finding out they didn't provide on-site laundry, we instead went across the street to Travel Inn. Although we sacrificed an included breakfast, we decided laundry was higher on our list of priorities. Entering room 65 in the corner of where the building L's, we concluded it was nothing to write home about, but would be a very enjoyable home for our time here. Clothes were quickly discarded and thrown into the laundry, showers taken, Freight Train shaved his head after driving him crazy, having become one centimeter long over the last couple weeks, before setting off to walk to Walmart nearby.
We passed through a couple quaint neighborhoods, every house appearing to be the home of a professional landscaper, driveways and flowerbeds filled with the brilliant reds, yellows, pinks, and oranges of tulips, the trees freshly bloomed, still a couple weeks ahead of the higher elevations. We roamed the rows of Walmart, Freight Train gathering a cart of enough snacks to reach Bland, VA, still a few days ahead, and me rounding up enough travel-sized toiletries to help in my transition of returning to a human again. We momentarily returned to the motel with our goods before immediately walking back to Sonic. We enjoyed our burger and chicken sandwiches, tots, and the beauty of the day as we sat on the outside patio watching traffic zoom along in one one of the busiest small towns I've ever seen. It's almost as if everyone is out driving, but with nowhere exactly to be.
We have since returned to our motel where we've been vegging out for the past few hours. The TV has been running since we returned, the most I've seen in over a month, rotating between baseball, rugby, the weather channel, Cops Live, and a series of outdoor-related shows. Although we've both actively been watching, it's remained mainly a way to fill the quiet room as we split a six-pack of beer, peanut butter pretzels, and chat as things come up. One hiker we last saw in Damascus recent arrived and was chatting with us in the parking lot just outside our room. Two locals rolled up in their car and told him to come get the Walmart buggy he left in their driveway. He replied that he'd be there soon, and they countered with him coming now or they'd contact the law. Such silliness. I told him he better get moving because it's smart for hikers not to piss off the locals. He headed off.
It's now nearing 6pm and Freight and I will eventually head back out to enjoy a lighter meal of some sort. When tomorrow arrives, Freight Train will eventually be meeting up with two friends from eastern Virginia who traveled here to spend a couple days hiking with him, and will gradually continue his journey north. I will be figuring something out in regards to how I'll spend the weekend, my bus ride back to Indiana not beginning until Monday afternoon. So that's that, another much-to-quick adventure comes to an end. Despite returning to Indiana and continuing in a direction that has yet to reveal itself to me, my heart will remain in the mountains of this special trail. I've met a handful of special people that I plan to continue to follow and support, offering tips and advice if/when needed.
In conclusion, I'll simply quote a summary I can only wish were my own words, but are instead those of author and PCT thru-hiker, Erin Miller, in her her book ""Hikertrash: Life on the Pacific Crest Trail"" that best describe why myself and many other aspiring hikers are drawn to life on the trail:
""Whether they admit it or not, every single hiker is searching for something. We're all pilgrims searching for something, searching for our place, for a sense of being, for a way to rectify the past, for a means to right wrongs, for consolation, for closure, for meaning, for purpose, for something bigger than ourselves. You don't hike this far, spend this much time in the present, this much time in your own head and not realize you're searching for answers to questions you never even realized you'd asked.""","Chatfield Shelter, VA

Cambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624679,"Day 39: VA 42, VA to I-81 (Marion, VA) - 12.1 miles:
Well, you're never finished until you're finished. It was either the trail or Freight Train that called me back after assuming I was finished yesterday. With plans to slack-pack from 12 miles north, back to I-81, I decided I'd tag along for one more go. We were both up at 6am after similar nights of tossing, despite having no plans until at least late morning. We'd spend the morning vegging on our beds, flipping between sports, weather, and old movies on TV, and lightly snacking as we waited for his friends, traveling from the Virginia Beach, VA area, to spend a couple of days with him on the trail. Arriving close to an hour early, we were caught off guard and unprepared when his friends, who I've dubbed Fancy Pants, Pink Panther, and Baby Gravy, arrived in their impressive black Ford Raptor, towing an equally flashy black camper they had just purchased and picked up on their way to western Virginia.
Fancy Pants, named so because he likes fancy things (truck, camper, watch, etc) served with Freight Train a little over a decade ago. Now a Senior Chief in the US Navy he's served nine tours of duty, his tenth approaching within the next year. With his nearly-full sleeves, his arms were covered in a variety of rich colors, tattoos I'm sure each come with a story. His muscular arms gently held their tiny four-month old son, dubbed Baby Gravy for obvious reasons. As a four-month old, Baby Gravy didn't add much conversationally, a few whimpers and outbursts, but was cute and added a new dynamic to the trail. Pink Panther, named so for her calf-high pink socks and cruising speed for someone who recently gave birth, is Fancy Pants' wife and herself a lover of running, hiking, and all-around competitiveness. Also along for the ride were their two beautiful dogs, Harley and Gunner.
Quickly packing our stuff in order to get to the trail, Freight Train and I were worried we'd both forgotten something, anything, but would later discover we had successfully packed everything. Climbing into Fancy Pants and Pink Panther's vehicle, we began the nearly hour-long drive north to VA 42, a quiet road only 12 trail miles away. The road consisted of many hairpin turns, turning back on ourselves many times as we winded along over ridges, farms in view one second and gone the next. We finally reached the bottom of the ridge, passing small farms with cows huddled together, hundreds of flies hovering in their faces.
At 11:30am Freight Train, Pink Panther, and me began climbing our way back over the ridges we had just driven over, Fancy Pants disappearing to drop off the new camper, park at The Barn along I-81, and eventually hike north with Baby Gravy and the dogs until meeting us in a few hours. The terrain would consist of a couple of climbs, followed be a series of minor camel-humps, gradually lowering as we'd approach I-81. The first few miles would pass through what's considered ""average"" for the AT - twists, turns, and minor bumps through leaf and pine-covered forests, occasionally exiting into brief stretches of cattle fields. With sweat dropping from our brows, we climbed up and over Walker Mountain, the biggest climb of the day, our legs churning us forward as we cruised at 3mph. As we hiked, I'd remain dominantly silent as Freight Train and Pink Panther chatted, catching up over nearly a decade - their lives, how Freight Train met his wife, mutual friends, their dogs, and the trail.
We then descended two miles into a gap between Walker Mountain and our next and last real climb for the day, Little Brushy Mountain. We took a quick break in the gap, everyone downing a Cliff Bar and some water, before continuing on. Ten minutes later and with Freight Train leading, we discovered we had taken the wrong trail and were instead following the Crawfish Trail. Feeling the urge to show a former Sailor how to properly navigate on land, ten minutes later and with me leading, we found ourselves still lost in the thick coverage of the rhododendron-filled gap. It was Pink Panther that happened to catch the almost barely visible trail we had started on, leading us back to where we had taken a break, where I easily spotted the AT, hidden from my view earlier by Freight Train.
Returning to the correct trail, we were soon up and over Little Brushy Mountain, the last decent climb now behind us. Not long after, and despite what I calculated to be a few miles off from where it should've been, we reached a small wooden sign nailed to a tree informing hikers they have reached the one-quarter way point, Georgia now 547 miles behind, and Maine still 1,641 miles ahead. On a small piece of notepaper above the sign, a hiker wrote simply and accurately, ""Remember these times and don't take them for granted. Last one to finish wins!""
Another mile down the trail the sound of barks broke the otherwise hot, still air of the afternoon. Harley and Gunner, both seemingly identical to me, came springing down the trail and up to Pink Panther, me moving just out of the way in time. A hundred yards along Fancy Pants was crouched over the trail actively changing Baby Gravy's diaper as I walked up. Having a fit after not wanting a bottle, Pink Panther picked him up and walked a hundred feet down the trail to take care of her motherly duties, returning after a few minutes with a happier, though gassier, Baby Gravy. With everyone good to go, we'd push along seven deep - Freight Train, Pink Panther, Fancy Pants, Harley, Gunner, Baby Gravy riding along quietly, and myself.
After a few final series of open pastures nestled beneath large rolling ridges, the gray of rain clouds building towards the west, we exited from the trail a stone's throw from the I-81 overpass, our riding waiting a few hundred road-yards away. I briefly entered a gas station to grab Freight Train and I a Diet Coke and Coke respectively, meeting them at the vehicle as they packed up their gear. Just after 4pm and within 10 minutes of us finishing, the clouds opened up and the first rain in over a week, save a light rain during our night at The Scales, fell. The timing couldn't have been better. Off we were down I-81, quickly covering the ~10 miles back into Marion.
Returning me to the Travel Inn, I would purchase a room for the next two nights where I'll be until my bus ride back to Indiana on Monday afternoon. I thanked Pink Panther and Fancy Pants for the ride and conversation during the day. I may only have known them briefly, but any friends of Freight Train must be good people, as they most definitely were. In what could've been an awkward goodbye to Freight Train , a fist bump, a hug, a few strokes of one another's beards, or perhaps a soft kiss, we instead settled for a gentlemen's handshake. Wishing one another well, our trailship concluded as quickly as it had begun and lived. I have a good feeling Freight Train will do well over the remaining three-fourths of trail. Be safe, my friend, and find your version of enjoyment every day.
Over the past few hours I've been a hermit in my room, unwilling to walk somewhere for food or even move unless necessary. Unfortunately, however, I've been on the move almost constantly with showering, washing my laundry in the sink, and continuous trips to the bathroom. After having Pizza Hut deliver me some wings, fries, breadsticks, and a two-liter of Diet Pepsi, which I politely, though matter-of-factly asked them to return and get for me after forgetting it, my overall health, though minor, has dropped. I can only hope the quick intake of greasy food has simply shocked my system, but for now I wrap up this final entry, I promise this time, with several quick sprints to the bathroom having taken place since I began. Tomorrow, Easter, will hopefully provide me a day of rest as I transition into returning to life off the trail. For those hikers continuing the grind north, or south: do so with clear minds, steady feet, and open hearts. It's been a pleasure.","VA 42, VA
