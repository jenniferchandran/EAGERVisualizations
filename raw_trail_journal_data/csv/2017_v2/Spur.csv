Spur,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555888,"I start my Appalachian Trail thru-hike in 16 days. What an insane sentence to write.If you told me a year ago that this was the next chapter of my life, my mind would be blown. In the winter of 2016, I moved across the country to California to support my then-husband during his PhD program. Unfortunately, he left me for another person not long after I arrived. In a city where I knew very few people and had yet to settle into a new career path, I woke up most days and fell asleep most most nights with the same nagging question: ""What the hell should I do with my life now?""Hands down, the best thing about my move to California is the passion I developed for being in nature. I don't come from an outdoorsy family, and access to the wilderness isn't quite the same in the Midwest. I started hiking regularly as soon as I moved to California, and before long, a rigorous trek became an essential part of my week. When everything else felt in disarray, hiking kept me centered. It kept me moving forward. It gave me time to breathe, reflect, and push my boundaries.My friend Gina, a frequent doer of crazy things, mentioned almost as an afterthought that I could hike the Appalachian Trail. Yeah right, I thought. Wasn't it, like, a super intense commitment? Sure, it would be a fun adventure, but I couldn't take so much time ""off"" from my life...right? I mean, who does that.... But the seed was planted. As other potential future plans (ex. ""Is now a good time to get my MFA??"") diminished in their luster and likelihood, my Google search history filled with AT related topics. Hiking turned into camping turned into backpacking. In late fall, I finally pulled the trigger on this mammoth undertaking. Most Northbound AT hikers start in Georgia between mid-March and mid-April, leaving my only a handful of months to build my gear inventory and do a TON of planning. It was a challenge I eagerly accepted.So here we are. I start my AT thru-hike in 16 days. 2190 miles across 14 states, 6 months from Georgia to Maine. I plan to write a couple more posts before I start the hike, including information about the AT and the gear I plan to carry for those who are interested. For now, this quick introduction will do. I needed to get this journal up and running. It already feels more real. Cheers!",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Tue",0
Spur,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555890,"I had my final backpacking trip in California this past weekend before I head east to start the Trail. I hiked and camped at Anthony Chabot Regional Park, one of my favorite destinations in the Bay Area. I couldn't have asked for a more gorgeous place to train.","

Spur,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555963,"M AT registration certificate has arrived in the mail at my parents' house! They will be graciously taking care of my cats and stowing my belongings while I am on the trail.Registering your thru-hike is optional but it helps to manage the influx of hikers and spread us out. It's an unofficial census of sorts. Based on the registration website, I'll be starting during a slight lull at the end of March (right in the middle of the suggested starting window).","

Spur,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557430,"Today will be my first day on the trail! I flew into Atlanta yesterday afternoon and spent the night at The Hikers Hostel (fantastic place, including a pickup from the train, a comfy bed, and warm breakfast to kick off the day). Most of the anxiety I had about my trip melted away over the course of the hours I spent with great company around a fire pit.
My pack is hovering around 40 pounds with food and water, not a bad place to start. I plan to shed some gear and make replacements along the way, hopefully I can get down to the mid-30's before long.
I'm all dressed and ready to go, still having a hard time believing this is really my life. There is nowhere else in the world I would rather be.
Cheers!","Amicalola Falls State Park

Spur,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558250,"8 days in and many, many more to go. I couldn't have asked for a better start to the adventure. I'm averaging about 10 miles a day and starting to feel my ""hiking body"" take shape. The pack is resting more comfortably on my frame, my shoulders are holstering the weight with less strain, and my calves are already beasts. My feet are holding up as well as can be expected. No blisters yet (some hikers are already lancing blisters daily) but I've got some chafed skin on the tops of my toes to tend to. I've had the pleasure of sharing most of my days and camping every night with phenomenal company. Engaging conversation helps the miles roll by, and every night at our campsite, we further settle into the comfort of our organically formed community. We don't necessarily expect to travel as a group for the long haul (and often spend days leap frogging each other as we hike) but I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know everyone's story and having each other's backs as we grapple with the early challenges of the trek. It's hard to believe I've only known these people for a matter of days. I had a pack shakedown at Mountain Crossings (Neel Gap) and dropped over 3 lbs of gear, which no joke makes a difference. Still working on not over packing my food and lightening my water load (1 L is 2.2 Lbs which adds up fast!). My pack weight is currently about 37lbs with 4 days of food and 2 liters of water. I expect to slim it down further as I go, but this is a fine place to start. There are too many ""firsts"" to count but some favorites are hiking 8 miles in 3 hours, hanging my bag without assistance (I trained with a canister), hitching in the back of a pickup truck, and staying asleep for more than an hour at a time during crazy storms. I've been keeping to my goal of personal journaling and working on some form of creative writing every night. I'm an actor and writer by trade and have fallen out of practice at continually generating material. Whether it's outlining a scene of a play, brainstorming a short film concept, writing a poem, or just stream of conscious rambling, this has already been a fulfilling pursuit and I damn well better keep it up. No editing, no self-censoring, just creating. I'm also reading IT, a book I've wanted to chomp into since I was a little kid. A perfect book to read by headlamp in the middle of a downpour.Oh, and I have a Trail Name! Spur, given to me by Banana Man. On an emotional level it resonates with the garbage year of divorce that spurred me to take back control over my life and set off on this journey. On a more literal level, I have a heel spur (google image search the little bastard) on my left foot that requires orthotics to manage and may cause me to get a cortisone shot along the way. It is empowering to know that I have a raptor talon growing off my bone and I'm still living this dream to its fullest. Talk to ya later!","Tray Mountain Shelter
