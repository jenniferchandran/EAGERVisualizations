Timber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542206,"I have been off the Camino de Santiago Trail for just over a week now and have made my way back to Colorado. It is now time to reflect back at the time spent on the trail and determine my best course of action for planning the AT. Things I carried and I didn't use on the Camino will be of primary use on the AT. At this point, I need to research tents, stoves and food options. My plan is to begin by accomplishing two weeks of the trail every year and slowly increase the time as my life allows in the near future. I will be able to reuse the sleeping bag, backpack, and other smaller items from the last hike. I am currently on track to hike out of Springer Mt next Spring. Over the next week, I will start creating the list of items I still need to obtain. Does anyone have suggestions for lightweight tents? Thanks for following along. See you on the trail.",,"Recovery is over, time to start planning","Jul 15, Fri",0
Timber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542915,"After walking the Camino Francis, I have discovered weak areas in my body. The first is my left arm because of a physical impairment and the other is the upper back. The weight of my Camino pack was 25lbs. My planning factor for the AT is 50lbs. It may be a little more or a little less. That has created a plan for me to work toward physically. More to come.","Recovery is over, time to start planning

Timber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543003,"“The old school of thought would have you believe that you'd be a fool to take on nature without arming yourself with every conceivable measure of safety and comfort under the sun. But that isn't what being in nature is all about. Rather, it's about feeling free, unbounded, shedding the distractions and barriers of our civilization—not bringing them with us.”
