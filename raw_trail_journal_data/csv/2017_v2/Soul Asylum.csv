Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437044,Well after many months of investigating all different types of gear and purchasing gear and equipment I think I am finally ready to take to the trail for three days to do a trial run to see how I make out and to witness the hiking experience to try to find out if it is something I can do. It is my extreme desire to do a thru-hike of the AT in the next year or two.     I have spent numerous hours on line and in Eastern Mountain Sports contemplating every piece of gear and equipment out there to fit my own personal needs. Due to back trouble and a small frame I need to carry as light a pack as I can possibly muster. I think I have made good choices and I can't wait to get out on the trail to check it all out.    I have a two and a half day hike planned for the Long Trail in Vermont in September to give it a go. I AM READY!!!!,,View Entry,"Aug 15, Thu",0
Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437108,Its Sunday September 15th and my buddy and I are off to the Long Trail Inn in Vermont to begin our two and a half day trial hike. I am very excited to be trying out my new gear and to experience the trai firsthand. The Inn is remarkable and highly recommended. An excellent starting off point. Dinner in the pub and lots of friendly conversation from fellow hikers. Tomorrow we hit the trail.,,Long Trail Inn,"Sep 15, Sun",0
Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437109,"Up and off early. We got a shuttle to the trailhead and were entertained by Gramps on a cool, damp morning. It was an awesome day, everything I expected and more. shortly after our hike began my buddy RSP had some difficulties and after a considerable conference he decided it best to trun back and we would meet sometime tomorrow back at the Inn. After just two miles I was on my own which gave me just a little pause. I had never been out in the wilderness like this before, never camped out even. But I was prepared. I had read everything a person could read, had plenty of food and water and had packed well. I had the pages I needed from the Long Trail guide book. 
It was 13.1 miles to the shelter. Good thing I had done some trial hikes on the Finger Lakes Trail back home. My back held up fine as the trail wasn't too grueling. It was beautiful being in the woods and climbing up and down rocky terrain. The trail was wet and slippery in places especially on the decents. The rain abated and the day was gorgeous. There was a tricky ford over Gould Brook when I had to decide whether or not to ignore the trail detour. Im glad I did, there were many entries in the register at the shelter regarding those who had a boring walk along the road. An hour after arriving at the shelter I was joined by a couple who were flip flopping and they were very generous and gracious in there company and we enjoyed a peaceful night. I slept fitfully and was awake early. I got to experience my first packaged pouch meal which was surprising good. Overall a great day on the trail. Tomorrow it's over Killington-should be a real test.",,Governor Clement Shelter,"Sep 16, Mon",13.10
Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437111,"Awoke early and had a breakfast of Huevos Rancheros soup--too much water. The trail today was incredible, much cooler and very windy and the climbing began early. On and off with the wind shell and gloves. Missed a turn early and had to backtrack to find my way. Lots of climbing today and Killington was a treat. The decents are very difficult on the quads, but overall my body is holding up well. Lots of rocky terrain, bog bridges, and a muddy trail. Met a few flip floppers along the way, but overall not too many people on the trail. I don't mind hiking alone, you can move at your own pace and not worry about going too slow or too fast. Overall it was a greuling day, lots of climbing and the trail was a challenge, and I feel I was rushing too much to get back to the Inn and my buddy. Several times I had to tell myself to slow down and be careful. Each step had to be carefull placed in most places. A sprained ankle alone would be a very difficult situation. Very rewarding couple of days overall.",,Long Trail Inn,"Sep 17, Tue",10.60
Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437112,"I was very happy with my gear-my sleeping bag and pad were excellent. It was 30 degrees and I was plenty warm sleeping. My pack was efficient but my shoulders were very sore, perhaps it just needs an adjustment to the shoulder straps. Was not able to try out my tent. Made a couple of rookie mistakes-I did not properly treat my water at the first stop of the day. I did not have anything to measure water with and added far too much to my breakfast which became soup. Other than that all was well. My clothing was excellent and I was very please with everything. My hiking shoes performed well, no blisters or problems. Just a few more odds and ends and I will be ready for the AT.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Wed",0
Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437159,"My fiance and I took a trip to Franconia State Park in New Hampshire for a quiet four day mini vacation and the trip wouldn't be complete without a hiking adventure. We chose the Flume Gorge and the Lonesome Lake Trail and both were spectacular. The hike up to Lonesome Lake with the autumn leaves in full bloom was breathtaking and exhilarating. The lake was serene with the mountains in the distance. We had coffee and a snack in the Lonesome Lake Hut and got to chat with the ""croo"" about their duties as caretakers of the hut. They were all very personable, encouraging, and informative and a couple were AT thru-hikers who shared some of their experiences. Overall a great day and a fairly easy hike without a heavy backpack.

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/438188,"While running a half marathon this past weekend and the suffering it imposed upon me, I could only marvel and shake my head at the thought I had during training of running a full marathon and the pain that would induce. You see I once ran full marathons but I was much younger then, and not as tired and exhausted as I am now. Around the eight mile mark I came to my senses and the thought seemed improbale if not downright impossible. Of course you run half marathons much differently than full ones but upon finishing I could not have run another mile.     What's this all have to do with hiking the AT? It's all about father time. You wonder what your body is now capable of and what it can do for you now. And for how long. And a lot of things about running can translate into cross training for hiking. Running helps to build endurance, teaches you to suffer pain, to perservere, to endure hardships, exposure to the elements-rain, snow, sleet, hail, lightening, blisters, body aches, broken toenails, etc. It promotes mental toughness.     I hope these things will help me along the trail. I will be 56 next spring. For certain it is a good age to go for a long walk. But there are always doubts, especially when you used to run full marathons and now your just happy to complete a half. After all who wants half of anything? I like the full moon; I don't want a half a piece of apple pie, I wouldn't walk my baby half way home. You get the picture. I don't want to walk halfway to Mt. Katadin.    The pain from the marathon seemed appropriate. Almost welcoming. I ran mostly for the motivation of my hometown and the events that happened there in April of this year. I suffered for those who lost their lives and limbs just for being supportive family members and friends of the running community. Just like my own daughter was there to support me this weekend you need to be reminded sometimes how blessed we are to enjoy the simple things in life and not take anything for granted.     The running community is extremely supportive of one another and the comraderie is very evident and encouraging among competitors, volunteers, and supportors. It is similar to what I have found from the hiking community. When I pass fellow hikers along the trail there is usually an ""enjoy your hike"" or some other kind greeting. The shelters are full of companionship and a sense of community. Trail angels appear like road race volunteers to make your day a little brighter and easier.     I don't know how far I will get on the AT. Half way, all the way? In a way it doesn't even matter. What is important is that I try.","

When he finished one of the guests asked him, ""what's it all mean?"" Beethoven then said, ""this is what it means."" and he played the entire piece again. Some things are so profound they cannot be explained in words. Such is the beauty of music.    To stand in the forest and look around, to stand on a mountain top and look down, to stand in a gap and look up, to sit on a bald and comtemplate your surroundings, to see a sunrise, a sunset, a rainbow. To walk through a meadow, beside farmlands, to stand beside a river or a stream. To look out onto a lake surrounded only by wilderness. To see a bear, a moose, a deer, or a grouse. To follow a trail that leads to much more than a mountain in Maine.    What's it all mean? Well, some things are just too profound to be explained in words. Such is the beauty of nature, of life.","

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/439510,"The not knowing whether or not I will be able to hike out next spring is the hardest part of all. My business is up for sale and must sell first before I can take to the trail. It is a good possibility but far from certain. It is very frustrating making plans, buying equipment, gear, supplies, clothing, etc. and not knowing for sure what is going to happen.        
I am extremely burned out from work and unsure how I will react if I have to face another stressful year in business. I honestly don’t know if I can do it. I have been following Canyoncat’s trailjournal and I can seriously relate to his on again off again hike for next year. He is being told he can not take a leave from his job to hike next year. I am totally sick for him and know how he must feel. Your dreams are right there in front of you and so far from your grasp. And you are powerless to do anything about it.         
You read about other people’s hikes and you want to blaze down your own trail. You want to escape from the world of everyday stress and the commotion and chaos of the working life and the demands and pursuits of those difficult pressure filled days of managing personnel, customers, orders, deliveries, inventory and all of the things that go into running a business, and govern the situations of everyday life in the fast lane.         
I’m sure the trail will offer all of the challenges and then some that we can and can’t imagine. One set of stress will be traded for another. Everyday life will be exchanged for trail life. Nothing worth anything comes easy or without a price. Nothing is certain. We have before us our hopes and dreams. The trail will always be there waiting for us. We just have to find a way to get there and take the first step.","

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443418,"Its official, my business has been sold. After 34½ it is hard to explain the many emotions that I feel. Relief and thankfulness are the first that come to mind. My AT hike is on!!    Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “What lies behind us, and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” That has been a theme of mine for a long time and that is the theme for my AT hike. How true that is, and it emphasizes the importance of the mental aspect for a successful thru-hike.     My plans have now been finalized. I will fly to Atlanta on March 24th and spend the night at the Hiker Hostel and then begin my hike the following day at either Amicalola Falls or Springer Mountain. I am now focused on clearing my schedule for the next couple of weeks so I can begin my hike. I can’t wait to meet all of my fellow hikers, trail angels, and town’s people along the way.     Although this has been a dream of mine for many, many years, in a way I never thought this day would really come. It always seemed kind of remote, almost like a fantasy never to be realized, like sailing across the ocean, or climbing Mount Everest.    I would like to thank all of my family, friends, and loved ones who will miss me while I am gone, and I look forward to your support and encouragement along the way. I will keep you in my heart while I am gone. I have read everything there is to read, and I have researched everything under the sun and moon. I have enjoyed reading the trail journals of those who have already begun, and I have been in contact with many others who are starting soon. I have especially enjoyed Animal’s posts as he has some awesome insights and ideas for us beginners.    I am both excited and anxious. I have never backpacked before, and I have spent most of my life indoors. My previous idea of camping was always the Holiday Inn. Even though I have often lacked confidence and self assurance I am hopeful of success. I won’t kid you or myself, I want more than anything from this trip to make it all the way to Mount Katahdin. That is my goal. I have always been more motivated by the fear of failure than by the idea of success. I don’t know why, I guess it is just in my own DNA. However, the possibility of failure is no reason not to begin in the first place. Indeed, the only people who never fail are those who never try.     We will never know what tomorrow will bring, so it is imperative to do everything we can to achieve our dreams while we are able. I just turned 56, my health will never be better. I just had eye surgery and all seems well, I have 20/20 vision again-one reading eye and one long distance eye, weird huh? A couple of nagging issues from my bike accident from last year but my main concern for this hike was the compression fractures in my back, and they have healed well. I am a little concerned with my weight, I am trying to put on some pounds without success. Most of my training has been running, biking and stretching. I will throw in a few hikes in the last couple of weeks. Mentally and emotionally I am getting myself ready for what the trail will dish up.    And so it is off to Georgia later this month for the adventure of a lifetime. Peace and harmony to all and I hope to see you out on the trail.  –Soul Asylum.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Sat",0

""How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard,""- Winnie the Pooh
There are a bunch of people who will miss me and I am grateful for them all. No one will miss me more than my fiance. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I could mean so much to someone.
""Peace is not something you wish for, Its something you make, something you do, something you are, And something you give away."" 
My business partner sent this quote to me sometime last summer when things were particularly difficult for me at the time. This quote made me realize that peace wouldn't find me, I had to find it.
""It is silly not to hope, besides I think it is a sin.""
""Let him think that I am more man than I am and it will be so.""
both- Hemingway Old Man And The Sea.
Favorite author, enough said.
""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and to see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."" -Thoreau
What more can anyone say before such and adventure.
""It's not how much you can take, it's how you take it."" -David Pirner
""Imagine all the people, living life in peace"" -John Lennon

I was unable to hike out of Hiawassee for two straight days so I made an appointment with a podiatrist in Blairsville and after x-rays and an exam he told me I have small partial tears in my achilles tendon and I need to take 3-6 weeks off. What?Words cannot describe my disappointment. I am currently home and will seek a second opinion locally and I am NOT giving up on my AT hike this year. I know doctors are want to be extra conservative in their prognosis but I am motivated to do everything in my power to get back out on the trail as soon as possible. I am sure this injury is my own fault by pushing through too many miles at the beginning but I felt fine and never seemed to be overdoing it. It is my nature to be competitive and I have always liked to push myself and I was always hiking within my ability and never felt I was pushing myself beyond my capabilities. I suppose my achilles felt otherwise. I would like to thank everyone for their support and I vow to get back on the trail as soon as I can.

Took my sweet time today no big hurry. Couple of sharp pains today in my left knee after traversing some large boulders and doing some rock hopping up and down but it calmed down and didn't bother me again. Came into Cable Gap Shelter area with the shakes from hunger, and very tired and weary. I guess living on oatmeal bars, PB crackers and ramon/Mountain House meals is taking a toll. But still have not experienced the ""hiker hunger"" yet and eating normally so far. Some crawling on all fours twice today. And again had to carry a lot of water as the sources were scarce. There were eight tents up, two in the shelter, one in a hammock and two cowboy campers last night, fourteen people in all, the most I have seen in camp since I have been back out.In some ways it's hard to believe I'm out here in the wilderness, having never really spent any time outdoors or in a tent. There was once when I was about ten that my Dad took me camping in Canada with some friends of his over a long weekend. We never did it again, not sure if he liked it or not.

Tried to convince them to go off trail no luck. I will admit to being scared. When they wouldn't leave the trail I backed up and kept watch. A few minutes later Bumble came along and together we went down the trail. The bears were slightly off trail and as we passed I stopped to take a picture of the cub. Big mistake. Mommy bear gave me a false charge. From about 15 feet away she gave me a false charge about five feet towards me, then stopped. It gave me a good scare. Note to self: Do not take picture of cub when momma bear is right there. Thanks Bumble for helping me through my first up close bear encounter. Saw tons more scat but no more bears.It started pouring rain early afternoon and I pulled into Mollie's Ridge Shelter intending to stay.

Everyone was out early and I got my earliest start yet at 6:45.Highlight of the day was Max Patch, a Bald where I had lunch. It was a beautiful spot and devoid of trees on top of this mountain. Very unusual and gorgeous. Man-A-Live showed up and we talked and ate. He started talking about a huge day and even considering making it into Hot Springs that day.(33 miles-he made it too) That got me to thinking that I could do more than the planned 16, after all it was only 1PM and we had already done 14 miles. So I decided then to try for Walnut Mountain Shelter at mile 20 for the day. They were difficult miles, most of the day was uphill and Walnut Mountain really had me struggling to make it. I finally straggled in at about 4PM. I hike for an hour and a half with Arch Angel and Motown but they finally left me in their dust. At the Shelter Man-A-Live, Arch Angel and Motown confirmed their desire to try for Hot Springs, an epic day. Ah the beauty of youth!I put up my tent but we got a forecast of torrential rain and high winds so I later took it down and decided to take my chances in the 1938 built shelter, a relic. It turned out to be a good decision because the rain really came down overnight. A group of youth section hikers fresh out of college filled out the shelter. An older man in a bivy tent ended up drenched and came into the shelter huddled in his sleeping bag in the middle of the night.I realize I am abusing my body and need a day off.

Walked a mile and a half to Route 58 which leads back to Damascus and decided I felt so bad I would hitch back into town and get into a bed. After an hour and no luck hitching-even after Serena came along and all but flagged down a car I decided to just get hiking. Not a real wise choice. I was very weak and finally after not moving for quite some time got violenty sick on the trail. It actually made me feel good enough to move and somehow I coaxed my body into Thomas Knob Shelter after 12.2 miles. An epic effort for me. Not a drop of food today and no ramon-about the only thing I dared eat so I traded Dos Equis a Mountain House for a ramon so I could at least eat something. Thank you Dos Equis. I got it down and went to bed.I was woken up by an animal chewing on my tent and after punching whatever it was I looked out of my tent to see I was surrounded by the Gratson Highland ponies grazing on the landscape. Ooops sorry guys!. These ponies have no fear of people and like to sample the hikers.My most difficult day ever on the trail.,"Lost Mountain Shelter

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460177,"Good night's sleep. Got back on my game plan by doing a big day to the Hurrican Creek Campground. Not sure how I managed on so little food but again I could not get much food down, but I did feel significantly better. What made it so easy was the terrain, which was all either flat or downhill. The rocks ascending Mount Rogers did supply some frustration and challenge and I managed to twist my ankle but all was well in the long run. Saw a couple of more ponies today which are cute.  I am only 28 miles from Atkins, VA and my nest drop but I have contacted my sister who is coming home for my parents 60th wedding annivsery party and will be driving right by the Relax Inn in Atkins the day after I arrive there so its just too much for me to pass up. I am very weak and have lost 14lbs and the temptation to come home is just too great. I need to put on some weight and figure out how to keep it on. Hopefully I can do that and come back with my sister when they return or figure out my situation while I am home. Had dinner at the campground and had the place mostly to myself. Just took it easy here and took advangtage of clean restrooms and surroundings.","Thomas Knob Shelter

I was tired and sore and weak and still feeling somewhat ill. Likely a lack of food and nutrition.I took my time and walked within myself. The last two miles were tough but I got to the shelter by 3PM. Lots of hikers here and I claimed my spot in the shelter because there is no tenting allowed here. Met lots of people I have never met before but have read about in registers. The shelter filled up fast and more were coming in so I took my stuff out of the shelter and set up my tent in a place which will not upset the envoronment, taking my chances.Saw a huge black snake on the trail today in the striking pose. Good conversation at the shelter and I stayed up talking much later than I usually do. A big diversity of hikers here from all walks of life.","Hurricane Creek Campground

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460184,"Weird day today. First half of the hike was uninspiring, walking through foggy, dead forests. Never seen so many trees on the ground, rotting dead. The trail also was very rocky and hard to follow. The second half of the day was much better although I still had no energy and felt very weak. The second half the forest was more alive and we had more open spaces, open fields and stream crossings. Got some real nice trail magic at the Lindamood School, fruit-apples, bananas, soda and chips just what I needed to pick me up and get me to town. Walking under some power lines that were hissing very loudly and making a great fuss I wasted no time in getting under and away from them.

But there was one thing that had been bothering me and troubling me ever since I left Pearisburg. It was the .4 tenths of a mile I had skipped heading out of town. There wasn't a day or even an hour where it didn't naw at me.    So when I got back to my car I drove South instead of North towards home, kinda just like I always knew I would. It took me an hour to get to Pearisburg and I found the spot where I had first come into town, parked my car, grabbed my poles and hiked the four tenth's of a mile up to Cross Road and then just turned around and hiked back to my car.    There! It was done. Every inch of the trail-and then some,from Springer Mountain, GA to Daleville, VA. And I felt a lot better for having done it.

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477074,"Back on the AT and had a nice day of hiking! Not too strenuous for the first day back. The trail was in very good shape. Lots of boulder fields where I had to climb up and down, around and under large rocks and boulders. In many places it was hard to figure out where the trail went because you would come to a boulder field and I would just stop and look around to where I had to go next. Usually 542 trail miles gave you a sense of the right direction and I would walk a ways and see a blaze or have to stop and turn around to see the correct way to go. Not a sense of being deep in the wilderness today, just kinda feeling you were fairly close to civilization. Made 9 miles by noon after starting at 8:30 and had lunch at a picnic table at Lamberts Meadow camping area. The highlight of the day was Tinker Rock Cliffs where I walked on huge rocks and two steps to my right was 1000 feet straight down. Very daunting. My back held up well today with the 34 lb. pack as I had to carry water all day today as the streams were barely a trickle. I hiked for 2 weeks on the Finger Lakes Trail without a scratch and one day on the AT and it drew blood. Typical.A few sprinkles this AM but nothing serious and the sun was out most of the day. Arrived at the shelter at 3:15 after 7 hours of hiking and set up my tent but it soon began to downpour so I took my tent down and got comfy in the shelter. Pilgrim and Mel showed up around dusk and the three of us talked and got ready for bed. My body was sore and I worried about sleep so I was agreeable to some hits off the pipe to help me out there.

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477076,"Decent sleep overall. Very challenging day today. Wow. Got lost once and thought I was lost another time. First time I had not seen a blaze in quite some time and after falling down a steep hill I knew I was off trail. Second time I had not seen a blaze for a while so I turned around and started walking back but soon saw a blaze on a northbound tree. You get to these boulder scrambles and you have no initial idea where the trail goes. The trail was frustrating this AM as it was not well blazed.The first highlight of the day was McAfee Knob. Amazing view one of the best so far on the trail The second highlight was the Dragon's Tooth. the .7 to Dragon's tooth took me 35 minutes-a lot of time and was the most dangerous half mile so far on the trail. Very taxing. I just had to put my poles away and climb. Rebar was pounded in to the rock in a couple of places and it was fun but also worrying. You would come to a rock wall and just look around. Straight up was the route. You had little 4 inch shelves on the rock you had to climb up onto and balance there before finding the next shelf, all the while your pack is pulling you backward. A ten to fifteen foot fall onto solid rock would spell disaster. Saw several day hikers out to conquer the Tooth.   
Very tired getting to the shelter which was .3 miles off trail and water another .2. UGH! Not very good tent sites so I was in the shelter again alone tonight. My shoulders ache where my pack rests and my legs are a little sore. Have to see if I can keep up this pace for another four days into Pearisburg? Actual miles 17.4 edited for total.

Hard day with lots of climbs. 1600 feet to the Audie Murphy Memorial which was very nice. Passed a large group of senior citizen day hikers along the way. Almost got lost just after the memorial- the trail is not marked at all for about a mile and a half along a wide corridor in the woods, not really a trail, and then all of a sudden the trail turns into the woods. There was a cairn along the trail and after I passed it I stopped and thought about the cairn so I went back and sure enough noticed the trail turning into the woods. Whew! Without blazes along the way you could walk a long ways before realizing your miss.   No energy today at all. Lousy night's sleep and a lame breakfast of cherios contributing to the situation. Had a couple of miles on Sinking Creek Mountain where you walked on the side of a ridge crest of boulders at a 45 degree angle-very taxing trail and ambiguous markings trying to follow the trail. Really it was fun once you knew you were on the trail. It is interesting to think along the way how the trail was routed and how they were able to get through some of these mountain obstacles. It has to be something like a maze puzzle and you wonder how many times they came to a dead end and had to backtrack and reroute the trail.   Sarver's Hollow Shelter was .4 off the trail-farther than you like after a long hard day and 350 feet steep downhill also. Then in the morning you gotta do it over to get back to the trail.   Set up my tent and got water and here we go again more rain during dinner so once again I took my tent down and set up in the shelter. Shark bait showed up and I had an enjoyable time sharing the shelter with this SOBO, fresh out of college and really enjoying his thru-hike.   I realize I am doing too many miles just coming back on the trail and I am hoping my body can keep up this pace that I have set, but I will do my best to maintain. 6 days of food is about the max I can carry so we will just have to see. I have been trying to baby my feet but with these boulders and the rock hopping it's not so easy to do.","Pickle Branch Shelter

They just need to get used to the hard sleeping surfaces and likely they will be fine just as I am planning to come off the trail. Luckily most days I still have the energy and drive to hike and the lack of sleep doesn't seem to be effecting me.   Thunder was rumbling early but I left at 7:50 hoping for the best. Rain, rain, and downpours today for six straight hours. I was drenched. Made 12.2 by 12:40 and stopped for lunch, took off my wet clothes and shoes and tried to stay warm while eating. Enjoyed conversation with a former thru-hiker and SharkBait who showed up shortly after me. Somehow I missed the Keefer Oak in the downpour. How do you miss an 18 foot round oak tree? When I stopped and looked at my map I realized it was .4 back and I debated turning around but couldn't bring myself to do it. I guess my head was down with the hard rain and I walked right past it. Everyone said it was right in the middle of the trail! You actually had to walk around it! UGH!    Long hard miles today, especially near the end. The last three miles were extremely tedious over sharp pointed rocks. Almost fell a dozen times. A miracle I made it unscathed. I was very glad to reach the shelter and at one point a big tree was down and it took me a good minute to find the trail again.   I was so tired I went for water without settling in the shelter first. I took off my shoes and put on my camp shoes, tied my hiking shoes to my pack and hiked down to the water source, quite a ways away. Clearly not thinking straight! Got water and returned and got set up, started to read and went to get my shoes to air out my wet orthotics and they were missing! What? OMG I remembered they were tied to my pack. I rushed down the trail to the water source but could only find one shoe! Unbelievable! Finally after slowly retracing my steps I found my other shoe. What was I thinking? OK another lesson learned!   I have a large full blown blister, impossible to avoid in all this rain and with wet feet all day. Originally I was planning a shorter day at a campsite but the rain drove me farther to the shelter. Three SOBO's- Arbor, Twinkle, and Scuttlebut showed up after dinner and were excellent company. Well after dark around 9PM two more SOBO's-The Kidd, and Wolfburger showed up with hilarious stories of going off trail for chilidogs, riding back in the bed of a truck in thundering rain, and finally losing dinner after being dropped off. The most amazing fact though for me was how they navigated that rock field in the dark. I have no idea how they pulled that feat off!? I'll admit I am afraid of hiking in the dark-at least alone. But that was some seriously amazing hiking for sure.   They got set up in the shelter, ate again, and everyone settled down while Scuttlebutt kept up their nightly routine of reading aloud two chapters of Lord Of The Rings, before bed. It was the first two chapters of book two and I thoroughly enjoyed being part of their nightly routine. The shelter smelled like a men's locker after a football game but it was well worth it.

The trail today was mostly good, I was relieved that it was not too rocky.    Just a half hour in it started to pour again and I was drenched in no time. UGH! The rain let up after an hour or so and after that just sprinkled. If it is just raining you don't really even notice or care-unless it's very cold, but if it pours down that is another story. The temperature dropped and the wind blew hard so I had to add my wind shell to keep off the chill.    I fell hard on a large root that was covered with leaves and I was down before I knew what happened. No discernible damage that I could tell, just a little covered in mud. Then shortly after that on a creek crossing I lost my balance while on some rocks that gave way and I fell in the creek-just my feet, not my whole body. I was very upset with myself and should have taken more patience in crossing.  I didn't bother with lunch today as there was no shelter to get out of the rain and I didn't think I could stomach another peanut butter sandwich on a dry bagel so I just had a snack and that left me with little energy this afternoon.   Arrived at the shelter at 2:30 and the gang from last night was here. I got set up in the shelter again as the rain had set in. Later a West Virginia trail maintainer came in and explained the trail reroute and the location of the water source which I was unable to find due to the reroute covering up the blue blazes to the water source. Seems they are getting complaints about the trail reroute being hard to follow. Killed the afternoon reading and journaling and trying to keep warm.   Around dusk two weary section hikers around my age-Antler and Yeddie came in through the gloom and the fog.   Couple of characters for sure. Antler and I chatted it up while Yeddie did some serious complaining about all things trail related and was soon in bed with several difficulties.  OK my left knee became swollen and very sore.

Complete turnaround and Antler, Yeddie, and I milled around talking and waiting out the pouring rain. I only had 6.8 miles to Pearisburg so I was in no real hurry. The privy here and in other places in Virginia was basically just a toilet seat out in the open, you were lucky if there were a couple of sides for a bit of privacy but no roof. Since it was pouring down rain, it was not a particularly pleasant experience taking care of that business of the day.   Antler and Yeddie were in for the taking a zero due to the weather and were surprised when I packed up in the downpour and said my goodbyes. They had some natural plant life to enjoy and were free to share but I declined and headed off to town and that DQ Flamethrower and a large Sundae I had been dreaming about for two days, not to mention a shower, but that could wait.    Made town by 1PM, had lunch, checked into a Motel which was absolutely filthy and had a shower. It is absolutely unbelievable how us hikers put up with the most atrocious rooms you can imagine. It is a room I never, ever, would stay in if I was not hiking. Most shelters are cleaner than some of the motel rooms we stay in. There was no other choice in town so I asked to move into another room but the house maid told me most rooms were like this.   Did laundry and got into clean clothes which was real nice and settled in the room to watch some football as it was Sunday. Had dinner out-forgettable and not a great choice, but decent in it's own perversely gluttonous way.   Made some phone calls home and caught up on all things local, including the news that my ""own nominated uncle"" had passed away, which brought to life and mind the fragile and precious reality of life.

I purposely thought about getting here on the weekend so I could watch football during my down day.   They did move me into a different room today which was marginally better and had a better bed so I was grateful for that.    Lots of time to think, whether out on the trail or here on a boring rest day of my life and my current situation and what is next for me.

Not so. I was confused and a little antsy and not really thinking clearly with the expected storm as there were already high winds. I got on trail and hiked a good mile before realizing I should have dropped my pack, hiked down instead of up the trail and found the place where I got off the trail on Sunday. UGH! I did not at this point want to backtrack. I looked at my map and could see my error. I missed .4 tenths of a mile of the trail. Damn!!   Nothing to do except carry on but it bugged me all day. I did not want to miss any of the trail.    Very windy today especially up on Angel's Rest(beautiful views) at the top of the mountain but I made it to the hostel before the rains and after stopping at Doc's Knob shelter for a snack around 2:30. Both my back and knee were quite sore, I wasn't that worried about my back but the knee was concerning.

After considering a slack pack decided against it. I was concerned about my knee giving out and worried if it locked up or became difficult to hike I would not have my tent or sleeping bag and would be unable to take shelter so that scared me enough to dismiss the idea.   Two estimated inches of rain overnight left the trail a virtual river. My knee is swollen and very sore but I pressed on and made the Wapiti Shelter at noon. Strider was here and we ate lunch and got out of our wet hiking shoes. There was a couple of stream crossings that were overflowing the banks and impossible to cross without just walking through them. The first I changed into my Vibrafeet but since the trail was a river and my feet were soaked anyway I just waded through them carefully trying not to fall in. In some places there was a foot of water on the trail and it really slowed me down.   After leaving the Wapiti Shelter I missed the trail turn into the woods and walked a good half mile out of my way before turning around and refinding the trail. Losing your way is unsettling and frustrating.   I knew I would reach the road crossing around 3:30 so I considered going another 6.5 miles to the next shelter but my blister became quite sore so I figured I would just find a place to pitch the tent somewhere along the trail or at Trent's Grocery if I wanted to go a half mile off trail.   At the road crossing I met up again with Antler and Yeddie, my own version of Bryson and Katz. There car was parked on the road and when they offered me a lift to Trent's I jumped at the chance for a burger. After eating and chilling I stayed with Antler and Katz and together we headed up the trail looking for a site to pitch our tents. Something I ate did not agree with me and soon enough I was sprinting for the woods.   Anyway we found a real nice site and just as we got there it started to rain so we quickly set up our tents and cooked dinner, then sat around smoking and enjoying some wine. Antler and Yeddie came prepared and were great company.   As I left them and went into my tent for the night I could hear the easy banter of conversation between these two longtime friends.

Got out onto the trail around 8:15 and did some fairly easy miles this morning. There was an uphill road walk for about a mile over Route 77 and another dirt road walk for about a half of a mile before the trail went back into the woods. On the bridge over Rt. 77 I stopped and watched traffic flying along at 70MPH and had to chuckle at myself walking along at a blazing 3MPH! I would take about seven hours to hike seventeen miles today and those cars and trucks were doing the same mileage in about twenty minutes. It is so awesome to out of ""Life in the fast lane.""   Stopped at Laurel Creek around noon and as I was having lunch Lightflight and Puddin came by. I was shocked to see them as they had left before me and I had not seen them along the trail. They took a wrong turn and got lost. For once it wasn't me. In fact when they left I noticed they took the left at the Y where I had come in on the right. I even put a branch down to direct me back the correct way, but I just assumed they came in from the left so didn't say anything. And I felt a little intimidated saying something th ""thru-hikers"". They almost always know the way where I sometimes get crossed up.   Got to my intended destination Jenkins Shelter around 2PM and Lightflight and Puddin were just packing up ready to push out. There were bear activity poster warnings up everywhere which gave me pause so I fetched water and had a snack while I considered my options. My knee was improved today but I didn't want to push it too hard. What to do? After some thought I decided to move on. The bear warnings did not thrill me and I didn't want to risk being here alone. I did not know if anyone was behind me.   Off I went and for the next three miles I had a 1600 foot climb which was steep and really kicked my butt. Had to stop on two occasions to rest, and I was carrying a lot of water as I wasn't sure where I would camp. There was a Davis campsite listed in my guidebook but it was a half mile off trail and the water souce was iffy, but with all this rain I figured it would be running fine.    As I finally reached the summit there was a plentiful forrest of fir trees and lots of soft even ground to pitch a tent. I thought why go a half mile off trail now and again in the morning so I found a good spot and put my tent up.    It's much harder to relax without a shelter. There is no place to set up, no place to sit and get comfortable. Your tent is the only option. But I made do and read in my tent until dinner time. After dinner I was snug in my tent but the wind began to blow a full fledged gale. As I looked out and around me there were trees down everywhere. What was I thinking? I wondered if I should have taken my chances with the bears. I worried all night that a tree would come down on me as the wind never relented all night. I did not get much sleep.   On the bright side my knee held up fine and even seemed a bit better and I never seriously had to consider going into Bland. But I would sure try to baby it and attempt to coax it to Atkins.

We made the shelter by 4PM and soon after Lonestrider, a 27 yr. old SOBO came in and made it a trio.   It was forecast to be in the low 30's tonight so I wanted to set up my tent but there were no decent sites and it began raining around dinner time so I set up again in the shelter. Rain continued throughout the night and didn't stop until about 5:30 the next morning. Since it was so cold we were in our bags by 6:30 but we had a great night and the three of us talked, laughed, and told stories until 9:30 when we drifted off to sleep.    Lonestrider was excellent company and was on a shoestring budget but he was having a grand time and in no hurry for his hike to end. He was indeed having the time of his life. He told one interesting story of a huge bear in New Jersey who stole his food bag and the ordeal getting to the nest town without food. The trail provided as it usually does but he was not happy about it, especially carrying out the trash the bear left behind after eating his food! Another jem was his longing for moon pies which he planned to indulge in tomorrow in Atkins. He was shocked that I had never had one and Sunshine and I both vowed to have one in his honor tomorrow.","Stealth Campsite

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477860,"Slept fairly well for a change despite getting up twice for a potty break. UGH the 56 year old prostate! The last break at 3AM was the end of my night's sleep but I was in good spirits as Atkins awaited and seemed like nothing more than a formality now.   Lonestrider said his farewell at 8:15 and Sunshine and I soon followed him out. We thought that we had seen the last of him but we came upon him at 10:20 during a snack break and again shortly after noon on his lunch break. He was kinda shocked to see us to say the least and he proudly told us that we hiked fast enough to be thru-hikers!!   Quite a compliment from someone who had just walked 1400 miles.   We enjoyed our time with Lonestrider again and both Sunshine and I gave him some money to help him out on his hike. As he left after lunch he came back to us and asked us for our e-mails and gave us his and he proclaimed that he wanted to thank us again upon his completion of his hike. What a nice guy he is and I pray for his safety and success.   My knee kept popping and snapping in pain off and on throughout the day and I was sure glad today was the end of this section hike. Sunshine set a rapid pace and for a while I struggled to keep up with him but I was determined to do so.    We made Atkins just before 2PM and Lonestrider was at the gas station in a disappointed mood as they were out of moon pies. I told him to check the Sunoco Station down the hill on his way to the trail. Sunshine and went to the Barn for a big lunch and as we were finishing I noticed Lonestrider walking up the hill. It was a good distance for him with a full pack but it could only mean one thing!. He came into the restaurant with a big smile on his face and presented us each with a Moon Pie!! We cancelled our dessert order and toasted Lonestrider by eating his present. I will certainly be rooting for him and will check on him in a month to see that he was able to finish.   Sunshine and I said our goodbyes, he really helped out my hike in the last two days, and I checked into the Motel and called my sister who was planning to pick me up in the morning.    I am thrilled to have reached Atkins in my time frame. 191 more miles in the bank. It was a challenging amount of miles just coming back to the AT without a lot of practice miles and you cannot duplicate the elevation changes from back home.   I am bound and determined to finish the whole trail as a section hike in the coming years, hopefully in two sections. We will have to see.   One last note. After I showered in the Motel this morning I noticed a mouse running across the room and into a hole. Strange how I never saw one mouse in the shelters during my two weeks back on the trail but as soon as I check into a room there one is right in front of my eyes!   Oh well thank you all who reads this and thank you for your support.

That four tenth's of a mile that I missed leaving Pearisburg had been gnawing at me and bothering me every single day and not more than an hour went by when I didn't think about what I would do about it.    So when I got to my car I got in and headed South instead of North and an hour later I was in Pearisburg again. I parked the car, grabbed my trekking poles and hiked the four tenth's up the hill to the Cross Road where I had picked up the trail heading out of town, then hiked on back down the hill to my car. There! Now it was all done, Springer Mountain, Georgia to Daleville, Virginia, every single inch of it and then some.    I didn't feel silly at all, in fact I felt quite content and the ride home was much easier on my mind, with lots of great memories to take along with me.","Home

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477862,"191 more miles on the AT this fall brings my total to 725, exactly 33% of the total trail. Just a little disappointing I wasn't able to complete a thru-hike in one year, but hey, I'm still proud of the 725 I was able to do this year. It's still a decent accomplishment. Only those who never try can never fail.   The wilderness is beautiful this time of the year. A fair amount of rain amounted to blisters and sore knees but overall things went very well. Not as many hikers out this time of the year but those I came in contact with were very friendly and supportive, as always.   Hopefully I can complete the trail, perhaps in two more section hikes of similar distances. We will have to see what the future holds.   There is a lot of time to think and pray out there. I tried my best to be true to myself and to hold on to what I believe. The rigors of a stressful working life can numb your senses but the peace and quiet of the woods, the way it touches and graces your heart and soul, and the beauty that your eyes take in, still remains seared in my memory, and I can touch it all through you.   I can fully understand why people come out here after a transcendent transition in their lives. For some of us there are holes to fill in our hearts and souls, and walking up and down mountains all day tends to fill those holes, like sand running through an hourglass, passing like time, while losing our mind, if only for a minute, or an hour, or a day, only to be turned over again to start the process anew.   In the end though, there is no place to escape for what troubles us or confronts us. None of this can take it away. We can only hope it will bring to us an understanding of what lies ahead, and behind, and how we will begin to deal with it all.   And that is the two emotions that all others can be directly related to and funneled into-Love and Fear. Really, it all comes down to them.    I thank the animals of the forest and the people I met along the trail for sharing the experience with me, and also those at home who followed me with thoughts and prayers. I carried you along with me in thought every step (approximately 1,657,500 of them) along the way.    Peace and harmony to all.","Atkins, VA

Earlier we had briefly lost the trail in Maryland on a very rocky unmarked section after following a SOBO who had to be bush whacking and asking if she was on trail.

The third was the half gallon challenge at Pine Grove a Furnace State Park. You have to eat a half gallon of ice cream in an hour, -- if you choose to partake. It is a hiker tradition. I thought I would easily do it but at 11:00am it was not so easy. The flavors were not to my liking either but wining aside I did it and got my wooden souvenir spoon. Then I had a bacon cheeseburger and was not feeling to well. We hiked out-Yep uphill and trudged another eleven miles to our stealth campsite under very hot and humid conditions. The bugs are horrendous, the little knats fly around your eyes sometimes entering into your eyeballs. As they fly around your eyes, your eyes focus on them like a camera lens trying to find your source and you can't see the trail clearly because your eyes focus on the knats right in front of your face snd not at the trail at your feet. Very frustrating. You spend previous energy swatting at bugs instead of using your trekking poles to assist your hiking. Snd you say things you shouldn't!!!Both Off Center and I were exhausted snd he is hurting with awful blisters. We may slow down tomorrow and take a short day, we're both pushing a lot of miles lately and need a break soon.

You sweat profusely snd your shirt and shorts get soaked. You try to clean up in camp as best as you can so you can sleep in relative comfort but your clothes take on an odor and when you put them on in the morning you yearn for the day they are clean again. I try to rinse out my socks and shirt whenever possible and hope they dry by morning. The other variable is rain. You hate to set up or tear down in the rain as your tent gets wet inside if you set up or take down in the rain and weights a lot more to carry.

Half my retirement taken from me. My life's work gone up in smoke like a chimney fire. I'm jaded now in ways I wish I wasn't. But again the Silver Lining. I have my health, my family, and I'm working on my faith. Overall I'm doing ok. I've made mistakes, on this adventure I'm working on forgiveness, healing, perseverance, faith, and courage just to name s few. I'm getting there, one step at a time, one day at a time. When will I be home Dad? I don't know, I just hope I will know when I get there.","RPH Shslter

At the bottom-whew-it was 4 easy miles along the Housatonic River which was beautiful and how I had pictured Conneticuit in my mind from the books I had read. I walked and chatted with Mr. Clean for a while then pushed on which buoyed my spirits. There was a bypass recommended for the Guinea Brook which I ignored snd crossed without issue. Then an 8 mile slog of ups and downs to a campsite that was dry of water, surprising as Conneticuit water has been plentiful. I have learned to carry at least a liter with me at all times especially near day's end. Thought about pushing on as there was is a large group of young men here but Snarf snd I had agreed to end our day here so I kept my word. Snarf had to pick up a mail drop in Cornwall Bridge.

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547984,"I slept well and was off by 7AM. When I got up to pee I remembered that I had a mostly full pack of M&M's in my hiking shorts so not wanting a mouse or a chipmuck to chew through my tent I placed the pack outside of my tent and not to my surprise they were gone in the morning.The first climb up Baldpate West was steep and got my heart going. Up West peak was all sheer rock, no footholds or handholds just hunched over climbing and keeping center of gravity low. The climb down was very steep and hard on my knee, there were ladders and even a rappelling rope to assist. I needed to zig zag to get down the rock faces safely with the slant of the mountain. Arrived at the Lean To at 9:30 for a quick drink and a bathroom break and to apply some Icy Hot to my knee. When I peed I was stunned to see blood again. I was in shock. WTH?? Seriously?? How is this possible? Why? Only one thought entered my head: This is it. It's done. How can I go on knowing any moment I could have another situation with kidney stones out here in the remotest section of the trail ahead of me? I packed up headed out, devastated. I called Pine Ellis for a pickup at the top of the mountain and headed for the road four and a half miles away over fairly easy ground. I got emotional at first and then very pissed off. Inside I was confused and and dismayed and way beyond empty inside. This must be what it is like to lose the World Series or Super Bowl. I feel defeated. It will be difficult to find the ""Silver Lining"" in this. Dreams live in the recesses of our mind and we think through hard work, perserverance and dedication we will succeed. Then they are extinguished in and instant like a light being turned out. The fears I have carried for over 1300 miles seem to be coming to fruition. I had one goal this year to finish the trail and it doesn't appear that will happen now and it feels like a failure. I will try to figure out what is going on when I get home with my doctors but I may have to finish this another time. It's not the end of the world but it is extremely disappointing, I cannot even express it in words. I appreciate all the thoughts and prayers I have received and I hope it can sustain me until I can finally hope to realize my dream of touching that sign on Katahdin at sometime in the near future.","Baldpate Lean To

Soul Asylum,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580902,"I have not added any journal entries since I had to stop last year in Andover, Maine.  I just want to add that I finished the final 257 miles from Andover to Katahdin from July 6 to July 26 of this year.  It was difficult starting back up in Maine but I felt great over the entire rest of the hike.  Maine was absolutely beautiful, although very wet and muddy.  Vermont does not know what mud is compared to Maine this year.  
I hope to update my daily journal over the winter as I had quite an adventure. I met many good and friendly hikers and excellent hostel owners and trail angels and am very thankful for their fellowship and support.  
Best of luck to all the hikers this year.  I hope to tackle the Long Trail in July.  Peace to all and thank you for your support!",,Mount Katahdin,"Jul 26, Wed",257
