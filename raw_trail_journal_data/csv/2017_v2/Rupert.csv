Rupert,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520270,"I did my first solo overnighter this last weekend in the Hatfield Wilderness in Oregon. I am glad it rains here in Oregon so often so I can be prepared for the worst, and hope for the best. I definitely learned some things I need to improve on. My pack was incredibly heavy on the 2nd day due to the rain and having to pack many things wet. I am trying to find better methods of keeping more things dry. The biggest problem I discovered during the hike is the lack of strength in my knees. Turns out there is such thing as ""Hiker's Knees"". Because of this, I have joined the local gym for a month, and will be riding the bike there every day that I am not hiking.",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Tue",0
Rupert,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553987,"The Osprey atmos AG 65 backpack feels great when carrying a 30-35 lb total load. Anything below 25# and I'd recommend a lighter backpack.    Used a Osprey Volt 75 last year, but the straps felt very hard and the balance of gravity was harder to get in the sweet spot. I plan on leaving in early March from Springer. I hiked the Approach Trail last April and would highly recommend it to anyone currently debating who has never been to Amicalola before.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Tue",0
Rupert,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555007,"Since the beginning of Feb. I have been staying in Asheville, NC hiking around in order to get back into shape. I cancelled my '16 thru-hike plans when I realized I would like more experience to feel comfortable. I definitely have that experience now. Unfortunately, about 10 days ago I stupidly descended a mountain too quickly and tweaked a ligament in my left knee. I tried hiking through it a couple times this week but that has not helped it work out so I have decided to let it rest for as long as I feel fit, or for the next 7 days, whichever comes first. Going up-hill does not bother it at all,however as soon as I start going downhill it is very excruciating. Did the uphills the last 2 days twice as fast as going down. I really hope this week of rest helps it. I am very thankful for my friend Emily who is flying out from Kansas to drop me off at Springer and then driving my car back to my parent's. We plan on going to Amicalola Falls and walking to the top, then driving around to Springer.","

Rupert,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555210,"According to the interwebs, I've developed patellar tendonitis from my shakedown hikes in WNC. Since we already paid for Emily's flight to ATL to come get my car on Thursday, I have to decide by Wednesday night if I'll be starting at Springer on Thursday or going back to Kansas until my knee can heal completely. If I have to do the latter, I can definitely still start NOBO somewhere north of the smokies in a month or so, and just do a flip-flop, returning to the spot I start at and going SOBO to finish the rest of the trail. I haven't hiked in 6 days now and have 3 more to let it rest. Super bummed. This is why I believe one needs to do what they want to while they can...tomorrow is never promised.","
