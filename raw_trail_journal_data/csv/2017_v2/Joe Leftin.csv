Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557884,"That’s it. Today is the day. A tent will now be home. I now rise and fall with the sun. Oatmeal and ramen become the mainstays of my diet. To say I am excited doesn’t really cut it. Kudos to those in my life who learned the news of my impending adventure and instantly gave support. I certainly felt the love, and I am grateful. Now, to the task at hand….I am sure a whole lot of pain and misery await. I am also sure the breathtaking moments will more than make up for it. Plus, “pain is temporary and chicks dig scars.” So to answer the million dollar question…..why? The answer is real simple. To hike makes me feel more alive than anything I have ever done. To stand at the top of a mountain, out of breath from the climb, heart pumping in my chest, and soak in the beauty of this magnificent earth. That feeling. That is why. So the next 6 or so months will be spent chasing that feeling everyday. Bliss, indeed. “So be your name Buxbaum, Bixby, or Bray, or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O’Shay. You’re off to great places.

Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558989,"If the first day was measure of all the days yet to come on this adventure I am in for an incredible walk. I began today at the visitor center at Amicalola Falls State park and walked through the stone arch as so many before me have. The steps up the falls, all 622 of them, were not as bad as those online claim. The trail itself, and the falls, make the trip worth it. I stopped for lunch at the summit of Frosty Mountain. My heel was sore, and I needed to rest. At that point I was actually a touch worried it would not allow me to make it all the way to Springer. The rest, some muscle floss recovery, and a couple of advil more than brought me back. It was at lunch, as I was preparing to leave, that I met Murph. He walked up, clad in new Zpacks gear, and we chatted for a few minutes. As we finished, he turned and begain walking the wrong way down the trail. I called after him to no avail. I suspected he would figure it out eventually, and I would see him down the trail. It turns out that happened sooner than I expected. Only a few minutes later I came across him on a forest road. We hiked the rest of the day together, and camped next to one another near Springer Mountain Shelter. The climb up Springer wasn't bad at all, even for this fat and out of shape 41 year old. The reward was the first white blaze and the official start of the trail. Plus, the view of course. I setup camp and wondered around meeting folks. There were a few section hikers, but it seems most of us are headed to Maine. I ventured back to the terminus to watch the sunset, and oh what a sight it was to behold. It turned the sky numerous shades of red and orange and continued to light the sky long after the sun had dipped behind the mountains. It is precisely these moments that make all the planning and effort worth it. Such a fitting end and beginning to an epic adventure.

Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558991,"A short day mileage wise, but certainly a good one. I took my sweet time breaking down camp this morning. Part of this was because a short day was planned, I am still inefficient at breaking down camp as well. I didn't leave camp until almost noon. Today's hike began with a significant downhill, but the grade was not steep and the first two miles were covered in under an hour. I took a quick break at Stover Creek Shelter (2.8) to stretch and apply some body glide. My lower back is definitely chafing. I will assess at Mountain Crossings and see what's up. I fear a pack change may be necessary. Oh, I forgot to mention I met Mountain Squid. It is always cool to meet those who do so much to support the trail. Kudos to you Mountain Squid. Sorry I will not get to see you at Trail Days. I hiked with Murph again today. We took a break and watered up at Long Creek, a gorgeous creek with a beautiful little waterfall. A short while later, just after the climb up Hawk Mountain began we came across another bigger waterfall. We took some pics and continued the climb. I realize there are bigger, steeper, and longer climbs to come, but Hawk Mountain kicked my ass. The steepest sections are near the top, and I needed to stop several times to catch my breath. Murph was great about waiting for me, although part of me wished he would leave me behind so I could suffer in private. I certainly miss my headphones/music on climbs. I left without the proper adapter for my phone. I can't wait to get a new one at Mountain Crossings. I arrived at Hawk Mountain campsites worn out and ready to get my pack off. Setting up camp was a breeze, and in no time I was hydrating, snacking, and getting my recovery done. The voodoo/muscle floss, and roller stick had me right in no time. Kudos to Early Riser 77 and his you tube channel for the info. I don't know where I would be without it right now. I met another thru-hiker named Jessica, who is already having blister problems. Ouch! I also met Chicken, who is from the U.K. and is trying to get to New York before his visa expires in 3 months. At that pace I doubt I will see him again. I built a small crappy fire with Murph and chatted with him over dinner. Chili ramen with chicken may become a trail favorite for me. I am gonna try and get an earlier start tomorrow. Murph and I plan to cover the 8.4 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter as there is rain in the forecast for tomorrow night. I hope there is space for us.

Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559003,"I am just settling in for the night on another glorious day. The hiking today was tough (I sense a theme), but the Georgia mountains are prettier than I expected. I hiked again with Murph today, but I am not sure how much longer I will be calling him that. I suggested his trail name be ""Story"" because he has a story for everything. He wants to sleep on it. Stay tuned. Murph and I spent the day flip flopping with a couple of Germans, Johannis and Brick. Brick moves pretty fast, but Johannis is out of shape like me so he joined Murph and I the last couple of miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter. The shelter is crowded tonight as rain is expected. I could have had a spot there, but but decided to tent. I am not sure how well I would have slept in such a crowded space. My mom posed an interesting question to me via text today. She asked if the trail has been what I expected? I believe that it has to this point. The entire experience is still so new. I have only goine 15.8 miles. I have gotten a touch better at setting up and breaking down camp each day, but I imagine I will be better still in 3 more days. #gettingbettereveryday (Thanks SR)I do find I am drawn to the rhythm of trail life. I wake up and have coffee. I read a little, and do my morning stretches. Breakfast follows, and then I break camp. I hike for a couple of hours, and take a little break. I hike a little longer, and then take a longer break to eat lunch, and relax for a while. I then try and push to the day's stopping point. I take breaks as needed, but the lure of the next camp and taking my pack off for the day is too strong to resist. I am worn out when I arrive. Water is always first priority upon arrival. I fill everything, and usually linger at the source to drink up while I am there. I then pitch my tent, and begin unpacking. I do my end of day recovery. I get into my camp clothes, and fix dinner. My appetite is normal for me, which is to say big. I am scared to see what I can do once ""hiker hunger"" strikes. I finish dinner with a cup of mint tea. Hikers retire soon after dark, and in this time I find myself back in my tent. I read. I journal. Before too long I yawn. My eyes get heavy so I turn off my head lamp and go to sleep. Wake up. Repeat. This rhythm is so different from my prior life, which had no rhythm to speak of. Each day was different. I woke up at different times. I ate at different times. I went to sleep at different times. Each day required a new plan, a new way of doing things. Already, only 3 days in, there is a certain comfort in knowing how the day will unfold. The plan is to head to Lance Creek to camp tomorrow. This will leave another 7.2 to Neel Gap and my first resupply. I am not sure if I will take a full zero there, or hike out after my resupply. Stay tuned. ""Just Be...And Enjoy!""See you down the trail, Joe","Hawk Mountain Campsites

Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559303,"If the Lord created a finer day for hiking that today I sure would like to see it. The weather was perfect. Last night's rain took all the humidity with it and left partly cloudy skies with a warm spring sun. The good Lord even saw fit to throw in a nice cool breeze from time to time. Thank you Lord. Amen!About last night's rain... It was a good course on trail management for us newbies. The rain didn't start until after hiker midnight so my tent had long been set up, and my bear bag hung. I had even finished my journaling for the night, and settled in with John Kennedy Toole's ""Confederancy of Dunces"". It is not my first time through, but if a book ever deserved another read it might be this one. I sure do love me some Ignatius. Anyway, the rain began as a light shower, but grew stronger. I could see the lightning light up my tent, but the resulting thunder sounded a ways off. The rain kept up for a few hours, but had stopped by morning. My tent was wet, as were my footprint and rain fly. I was able to dry them completely the next day during my lunch break at Woody Gap. I am now hunkered down again in my tent dry and comfy. First rain test passed with flying colors. My guess is that is won't always be this easy. I did receive my first ""trail magic"" today at Woody Gap. A guy name ""Lyric"" had chocolate pudding and Dr. Pepper. The ensuing sugar rush made the next climb the easiest of the day, and perhaps of the trail so far. Kudos to you ""Lyric"". Today's hiking was the easiest day so far, but was by no means without its steep climbs. The climbs are becoming easier as I have improved my breath and become more efficient in my movements. Slow and steady definitely wins these races. Tomorrow holds the biggest climb yet, Blood Mountain. The name is even ominous. Murph and I plan to rise at 5:00am to catch the sunrise at Jarrard Gap before climbing Blood. Hopefully we will be eating pizza, and drinking beer by tomorrow afternoon. Until then.....""Just Be...And Enjoy!""See you down the trail, Joe","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Joe Leftin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559368,"What an incredible day. My 5:00am alarm went offr, and I was up instantly. I had a mountain to climb, and the sooner I got it done the sooner I could get to Neel Gap. Murph and I were the first ones out of Lance Creek, and we hoped to make it up to Jarrard Gap to see the sun come up. We didn't quite make it, but it was probably for the best. It was a chilly morning, and Jarrard Gap was like a wind tunnel. I stopped to admire the view, and have a Clif bar. I was cold by the time I was finished. The trail continued along the ridge line with the wind really howling at times. Murph and I stopped at the Slaughter Creek trail junction right at the base of the Blood Mountain climb. Will, who is hiking with his Dad, and was camped near us at Lance Creek, came by at that point. We chatted for a few, and I told him about the plan to try and get a cabin down at Neel Gap. He then continued on in front of us. The climb up Blood Mountain was long, but not horribly steep. Murph and I made it to the summit by 11:30. We had covered 4.8 miles and had climbed over 2500 feet all before noon. Not too bad for this out of shape 41 year old. To make things better, Will had called down to Blood Mountain Cabins and secured us one of the last remaining cabins. Kudos to Will. We admired the views from the top of Blood Mountain for a bit, but the pull of pizza, beer, and a hot shower were too much. The descent down Blood Mountain to Neel Gap was steep and very crowded with day hikers. It wasn't until about half-way down that I realized it was a Saturday. I was glad our early start put us on the summit before before the crowds arrived. I also chuckled at myself for not knowing what day of the week it was. I knew it was day 5. That is what was important. We arrived at Neel Gap just before 1:00 checked out Mountain Crossings, and had a pizza. We got checked into our cabin and showered. Will and I hitched down to the store to get some food and beer. When we got back to the cabin Will's Dad had arrived. The four of us spent the rest of the night chatting about the trail, those of us on it, and gear. Will and his dad, Kinsman, are from New Hampshire, and had lots of great info and stories about their adventures in the White Mountains. I had a bit of a stomach issue (too much pizza), and got to be early. I spent the first 20 minutes in bed trying to convince myself I didn't have Norovirus, but I was finally able to get to sleep. It has been a glorious hike thus far. I have only 2 regrets. 1. Wear sunscreen. 2. Wear even more sunscreen. ""Just Be...And Enjoy!""See you down the trail, Joe","Lance Creek
