Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556876,"This will be my first time hiking The Appalachian Trail as a thru hiker, well any Trail actually. I've never hiked more than 5.25 miles in one day, and that was on level terrain. I am hoping I can do this! I am taking my son's dog, Tundra, with me. I am nervous, excited, and somewhat over whelmed by the magnitude of the preparations. I have been reading everything I can get my hands on about equipment, the Trail, and autobiographies of previous thru hikers. I have most of my equipment bought but question several choices I've made. I have packed and repacked my backpack a dozen or more times. My pack weighs 37ish pounds. I would like to get it to 30 before I head out. So I'll be unpacking and repacking a few more times before I'm through.","

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556877,"My last shipment of dehydrated food came yesterday so I spent the day filling my 12 supply boxes. These are boxes two of my daughters (Rachel and Janet) will ship to me about every other week. Each box holds food for 6 days, toiletries, and seasonal clothes as needed. I plan to visit a town once a week to sleep in a hostel or hotel (if a dog friendly place can be found), shower, do laundary, buy food, and charge my phone and portable chargers. Well that's the plan any way. We'll see how that turns out.","

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556878,"So, I got Tundra, my dog (she'll be mine for awhile), all packed up today. She has an orange saddle pack that carries her food, treats, and collapsible dish. She weighs 58 lbs so I'm trying to keep her pack around 10-12 lbs. She has a coat for cold days and a sweat shirt for cold nights and if it's really cold she' can wear both, with the rest of us! Still waiting on her tennis shoe/boots to be delivered. I bought her some mitten/boots but they were huge. It's been interesting trying to size her paws as she's a tall dog but she has narrow paws. If I get the shoes to fit her width then the length is too short. Hoping this next pair fit! I also got her a really good quality blanket to sleep with and her coat will double as her ground cloth, as it's rain resistant on one side and fleecy or wooly on the other. I had thoughts of making her a sleeping bag but already feeling weighed down. Tundra also got a new leash and collar. Thursday, we went to the vet and got caught up on all her vaccinations, heart worm meds and flea and tick meds. They even trimmed her nails! So, Tundra is ready to hit the trail in style! She looks forward to the hike and meeting everyone out their! Don't worry though if your not a dog lover we understand and will use good trail etiquette!","

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558004,"Sunday Tundra and I hiked 3 miles at Patuxent Wild Life Research Center. It was cold, 47* but on the bright side I got to try out my new fleece hat and cowl neck warmer both bought at Mac Dill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida, both kept me toasty! Tundra tried out her coat too! 
On Monday, we hiked 5.25 miles at the same location. It was beautiful out, 70ish! There were many people out walking, running, photographing and just absorbing the rays! Funny how different one day can make. As we hiked, we saw 69 frogs, no joke! It was enteresting to try and avoid stepping on them as they were everywhere on this 1 mile stretch by Cash Lake. They were so cute too giving each other piggy back rides! Planned on hiking 7 miles on Tuesday but could barely walk when I got out of bed. Went to a podiatrist and he diagnosed my heel pain as ""Plantar fasciitis"". I leave on Saturday for Georgia so he most graciously shot me up with some cortisone, gave me (suggested I buy from him) a $45 insert for my boots and gave me information on exercises. All in all, it was a great day, which is code for: I'd rather been hiking instead. Since I was laid up all day I got my photos to upload, put in my Gear List, and added my Mail Drops to my journal. Getting closer everyday!","

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558830,"Drove down from where I live to Virginia on Friday to catch a ride with daughter, son in law, and their baby Joel. Left their house Saturday morning and drove all day. Made a few stops along the way for baby or for last minute supplies. Got to hotel at 1:30 in the morning. Slept in then went to Waffle House for breakfast. Then drove to Amicalola Falls State Park. Signed in, I am the 1490th person to start a through hike this year, from Springer Mt. Weighed backpack, it weighed in at 40 lbs., got another shake down to see what else I could leave out, I donated a few food items to the hikers box. Then we drove to the Springer Mountain parking lot off Forest Service road 42. It was a long trip ending with a 6.6 mile bumpy, windy, gravel road to start. I was relieved to get on the trail. Started around 1:30 and it took me 2 hours to go south .9 miles to Springer Mountain and back to the same parking lot. Then proceeded north to Stover Creek Shelter, which is 2.8 miles from Springer Mountain. Total 3.7 miles for first day, I was hoping to do more but with late start, not to mention I was exhausted (hiking up mountains is so much harder than I imagined). Got to shelter around 4:30, put up tent and cooked the heaviest thing in my pack (a MRE taco dinner), then promptly went to sleep!","Springer Mountain, parking lot on Forest Service R

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558832,"Woke up to rain. Waited hoping it would stop but at 9:00 I ditched that idea and started packing up wet tent. Signed the shelter journal then headed out around 10:30. It went from drizzle to torrential down pour many times throughout the day. At 3:30 I reached Hawk mountain campground and proceed to set up wet tent. Everything was soaked, clothes, tent, sleeping bag (only damp), then I noticed the ground was oozing water under my tent so the floor stayed wet all night. I inflated my sleeping pad and sat on it while I stripped out of wet clothes, it was cold but I washed up the best I could with baby wipes, then put on damp but clean under clothes. Then crawled into sleeping bag, grateful that I up graded it, because down will keep you warm even wet, and remembered that my big sister insisted that I buy an emergency blanket. Thanks sis, I wrapped it around my legs and torso. Took vitamins and Aleve pm, ate a Kind bar and promptly went to sleep by 4 in the afternoon, to the sound of rain. Slept on and off trying to keep Tundra covered, I put on her sweat shirt and covered her with her blanket but with floor wet it was hard keeping her warm (but she wasn't shivering).","Stover Creek Shelter

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558835,"Woke up at 4am. Forced myself to put on wet clothes and started packing things up, thinking it would be daylight soon. At 5am decided to eat tuna on crackers because the day before I only ate a protein bar and a Kind bar. I have no appetite yet. Then laid down on sleeping pad to rest for a minute while waiting for daylight but started hearing things that go bump in the night and realized I just sounded the dinner bell for any animal within smelling distance. Prayed for Gods protection again and because it is eerie in the woods alone asked God to send me a companion that hiked at my speed of 1/2-1 mile per hour! Sat back up and started journaling in my half drenched journal. I will probably throw it away and just print my blog out when I go home. Anyway daylight finally made an appearance at about 7am, so I unzipped my tent and starting packing everything away. It still takes me almost an hour for this chore. Was on the trail by 7:50 with a much heavier pack! I was into the first mountain and it was hard, when I happened upon an elderly woman who had been resting on some gigantic rocks. We started conversing back and forth when I asked her her trail name. She said ""Knobby"" and I couldn't believe it because I had been following her blog and we had emailed each other because we were starting a few days apart. I went a day late, she a day early and voila we met. I said, ""Knobby it's me Journey"" I asked about her hiking companion she came with and she said she hikes 15 miles a day and she told her to go on with out her. When I mentioned praying that morning that God would send me Companion, she answered that she had just prayed the same thing while resting and there I was! God is good! We hiked all day long together and it's been great, or as great as it can be when your using muscles that you haven't used in forever. We went up three mountains and they were tough. Worst part though was running out of water just after lunch. It wasn't until 5pm when we got to Cooper's Gap that we were rescued. There was a big Army water tank and while getting our fill, Ron Brown, an AT transporter drove up and told us that another big storm was headed our way, tomorrow. We asked if he could take us into Dahlonega he said he could take us to Woody Gap where we would have a better chance of a ride into town. We jumped in and as we rode he called ahead and got us a second ride. He also told us which hotel would take a dog and we called ahead and got a reservation. So we are taking a zero day tomorrow (a zero day is when you hike zero miles). We ate McDonalds because it was the nearest to our hotel, showered, and tomorrow we will hit the laundromat, store, bank, etc...","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558905,"My first, but certainly not last, zero day was spent doing maintenance on several things. First we unpacked our backpacks and hung tents, sleeping bags, etc. up to dry. Then, Knobby and I went to the laundry mat and was greeted warmly by Brad the owner who is a very pleasant and helpful person. We got food at Moe's and ate it in the laundry facility, while waiting for clothes to dry. Came back and uploaded pictures to my blog. Still trying to put more on but the site can be temperamental at times so moved onto blogging. Watching the weather channel and convinced that we should stay here until Friday. Made my blog as an icon on my phone which saves me from typing the web address every time I want to access it. For those of you who are following me you can down load the blog as an icon too. Just pull up my blog and click the square at the bottom of the page or hold it down, then click ""add to home screen"". Good luck!

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559035,"Well we woke up this morning and Knobby suggested we try our luck back on the trail. I agreed and she called and got Dixie to come and pick us up at the Motel Inn. The ride back was hysterical as Dixie shared many stories with us on the 40 minute drive back to Copper's Gap. We got a late start (got on the trail around 11:20) but we Made the best of it. We felt great our packs were lighter and our bodies rested. The weather threw a lot at us. We had rain, sleet, sun, wind, but we dressed for it. We reached Gooch Mountain Shelter at around 3:00 and ate our lunch. I had tuna salad on a tortilla shell. After refilling our water bottles we pushed on to Gooch Gap. Got here around 5:00 and set up our tents and cooked dinner (I used my pocket rocket for the first time). We hung bear bags, then crawled in our sleeping bags. It's supposed to be a cold night and very windy, around 34*, I think. Will be asleep at 8:00 and hope to be warm.

Occasionally it would warm up, so I would take off my backpack and take off my coat, then around the next turn ""bam"" the wind would return and I'd freeze until I stopped and took off my backpack and put coat back on. Crazy day for sure.We left Gooch Gap at 9:30 and planned to eat lunch at Woody Gap (3.5 miles away) but when we arrived there at 2:00 it was too windy. I was freezing. Couldn't think of anything except ""we have to get out of here"". We continued to walk on but it was getting hard because we needed calories. At almost the top of Ramrock we stopped and eat, right on the trail, on some big rocks. Then walked on until 5:00. When we came to a camp ground at Dockery Lake Trail and called it a day. Snug in my sleeping bag, just wish the wind would die down. Good night!","Gooch Gap

They spring up from the dead leaves in the forest, beauty amongst all the dead. It's amazing! I can only capture a fragment of the vastness. The flowers are popping up all throughout the woods! Simply a gorgeous world God has created!
Knobby and I decided to hike only 2.7 miles today knowing that tomorrow will be a hard climb up Blood Mountain.","Dockery Lake Trail

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559618,"I knew it would be hard and Blood Mountain did not disappoint! We started early around 8:30 and it took me until 12 noon to get to the summit, there I had lunch, took some pictures and rested, hoping Knobby would soon turn up. Then about 12:30 I headed down, having not seen Knobby yet. Got lost following three younger adults but we found our way back. The way down was 2 1/2 miles of treacherous and hard terrain. My knees and feet were hurting pretty bad when I finally got to Neels Gap. I bought a pizza and coke to celebrate making it through! I had a resupply box waiting for me at the Walasi-Yi Center. Knobby made it down shortly after I did, she stayed at the hostel, I camped behind the hostel. I was disappointed that they no longer offered campers showers due to the drought and their laundry was broken. Oh well, I washed up back at camp the best I could. That night 4 Christian men were having a camp fire and I joined them for a brief moment of sharing. Was in bed by 8:30.","Jarred

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559621,"Today we left Neel's Gap around 9am. I had a newly stocked, heavy pack. We hiked up and down three medium sized mountains but they were almost as hard as Blood Mt. We stopped at a spring to get water and eat lunch around 1pm. While at the spring, I decided to do my laundry because my pack wasn't quite heavy enough yet, so I thought I'd add wet laundry to it! Knobby got a good rest. We then hiked to the top of Cow Rock Mountain and decided to set up camp. Watched a beautiful sunset. 
P.S. I did my laundry in a gallon size ziplock bag with 2 drops of soap and walked far away from the stream before draining my water. Did not rinse clothes as they were not soapy. Hung clothes over branches to dry but they were still damp when I packed them back up.","Neels Gap

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559777,"This has been another very long, hard day. I love my friend, Knobby's quote that she obtained last year on the trail, ""What part of hiking up mountains did you not understand?"". I ask myself that many times a day. I guess I thought it would have an easy day in there somewhere but I have a feeling that's a negitory. We woke today at 7am to a pleasant day. Got on the trail by 8:30 and preceded down Cowrock Mountain. We hiked up and down several mountains, some with inclines at 60-70 degrees, it was intense. The descent was just as hairy. Brutal on the toes and knees. Stopped for water at Hogpen Gap. The picture is of me getting water!We stopped for lunch around 2pm. Then continued on until 5pm. We are at Low Gap Shelter tonight and there are maybe 30-40 people here. My pack is still to heavy. I have to make some adjustments in my shipments as I am unable to eat food fast enough, and carring it is hard. Thank you to all who have left messages. I don't have enough battery to answer you all, I hope you understand.","Cowrock Mountain
",Low Gap Shelter,"Apr 11, Tue",6.50
Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560013,"Well, the day started off fairly easy but I got a little bit of a late start because I wanted cocoa for breakfast and that meant I needed to get more water for the Trail and then decided to use the privy before heading out. So, got on the trail at 9am and the day started off beautifully! The trail meandered through the forest and around mountain sides, not to up and not to down but just right! I covered 4.3 miles by 12 noon and stopped for lunch. After lunch it all went down hill, or I should say up, and up Blue Mountain. The elevation wasn't even the challenging part. It was rock slide after rock slide. I lost count after 7. They were long stretches of rocks piled on top of rocks, some stretches as long as 100 feet or more. Anyway, it took the rest of the afternoon to go that 3 miles. Several times Tundra laid down and wouldn't go on. I'd give her water, let her rest and then forced her up knowing we'd be safer amongst other hikers.At one of the springs, I stopped and while filling my bottles I decided to let Tundra off her leash so she could get water farther down the way. She slowly goes and gets some water and then before I know it she was halfway down the mountain side. I called and called to deaf ears. Just then two young people came down the trail and I asked if they would call ""Tundra"" for me. They politely obliged and she came right back because she's all about meeting new people and getting a rub down! But I did have to wonder where she mustered up all that energy? Shortly after that it started to rain. It was just what I needed! It was refreshing and helped energize me for the last half mile. As I pass the water source for the shelter I refill yet again and then climb the last hill huffing and puffing. I started setting up my tent in the drizzle thinking I might be eating a cold dinner tonight but it soon stops and the sun came out and I made dinner (Chicken and Dumplings). I worried about Knobby as I hadn't seen her since lunch, then I get ""Trail Mail"", a person comes and lets me know she has stopped for the night back a ways. I say a prayer for her safety as I crawl in for the night.","Low Gap Shelter
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",7.30
Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560014,"This was a repeat of yesterday's rock slides but on the descent. It was hard on the toes and knees. I thank the Lord my knees took turns hurting. I don't know what I'll do if the day comes when they both hurt at the same time. By the way, my plantar fasciitis hasn't been too much of an issue yet. My heel hurts mildly after 4 miles if there's a lot of down hills. Other than that it's my knees that have given me cause to worry. So it was a short but painful day today. Knobby came in to Blue Mt shelter area at around 8:30am and proceeded on while I yet again went south, back down the steep hill to fetch more water. I got on the trail at 9:00. We suffered as we raced down the mountain. We were trying to catch a shuttle that picks people up at 11:00am, at Unicoi Gap and takes them into Hiawassee, Ga. We had 2ish hours to get 2.4 miles. We both were in pain and at one point Knobby was hurting so bad that she laid down right on the trail side. We gave it our best try but we didn't make the shuttle. So when we reached the parking lot, Knobby in the lead, we collapsed in the grass, rested and then start trying to find a way into a city. We had no working phones as our batteries were dead but another hiker let me charge up my phone enough to make several calls. Called several Motel, hotels, Inn's, trying to find one that offered shuttle service, took dogs, and wasn't too pricey. Also called several shuttle service individuals to see who could help us, to no avail. Why is it we exhaust our own capacity before we pray? But as my battery life dwendled down to 1% again and I felt helpless I prayed out loud ""Lord, you know we are too older women who are stuck out here in this Gap with no way to get to town and we ask you to provide a way so that we can get to a hotel so that Knobby can meet her husband and grandson tonight"". I kid you not, as soon as I finished that prayer a young female hiker, who was resting her feet before continuing on, said ""Hey maybe that guy over there in the rental car could give you guys a ride, he's just waiting on his sister"". She proceeds to call him over and asks for us. We join the conversation explaining our need and our willingness to pay for his serves and he accepts. Praise the Lord! We were saved! As we drove to Helen, a little Alpine touristy town, he calls the hotel (that he stayed in the night before to recover from sickness) and makes sure they have rooms and took dogs. Wow! He did make it back, met his sister and they continued their hike.
He drives us to Quality Inn! We get checked in, showered up, and on our way to and from the laundry mat, we are! Life is good and God is great! I'm resting up for a few days to let my knees heal. Also, made arrangements for Tundra to go home. The last two days have shown me that this is too hard on her. It's been hard on me too, a dog on the trail is like having a toddler to look after. Plus, I can't stay at most hotels or hostels or get rides. I'm going to miss my sweet Tundra! But it's best for both of us!","Blue Mountain Shelter

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560046,"Stayed up pretty late last night doing maintenance on my blog. Fixed two days that were actually one, fixed mileage, named and journaled each picture, added more pictures, added pictures to correct dates, blogged the last two days, etc... So scout around a little if you want. Send me a text if I need to fixed something else. I tend to be terrible at tenses, I go from past, to present, to future tense all in the same paragraph. Auto correct messes me up sometimes too! So taking a few days off as I wait for my son-in-law, James, to come pick up Tundra and take her back to Virginia. James is a real life saver, I don't know what I would have done if he couldn't have come. Then Monday, my daughter, Janet (and possibly James), will take her the rest of the way to Maryland. My knees will certainly appreciate the rest. Took Tundra out at 9:00 for quick walk. Then ate breakfast at the Hotel's buffet. We then walked to the city park and walked leisurely throughout. Tundra smelled every tree, shrub, flower, rock, and you name it, until she had her fill! Met Knobby's husband walking by the park. He called me by my name, not trail name, I was surprised and a little confused at how he knew my name, then he introduced himself and I was immediately releaved. We had a nice chat and after taking the dog back to hotel, we walked back down town and grabbed a bite to eat at a barbecue place, right on the water. It was nice swapping stories back and forth. What a beautiful day it was, I am glad the weather is good for Knobby and her grandson. I'm missing the trail already and can't wait to be back on the trail again (cue music).

We were waiting for James, my son-in-law, to pick up Tundra for me. Got a ride with Knobbies husband to Unicoi Gap thinking it would save James some time but it didn't. After Tundra was picked up at 5:30 I headed up the trail. Rocky Mountain was tough and it took me until 7pm to get to the top. I decided to pitch my tent and call it a night. I was a little freaked out because I was all alone. I missed Tundra. I missed my solar lantern. I missed Knobby. I was in my tent by 7:30 ready to sleep. I kept hearing something sniffing about my tent. Then I'm snuggled deep in my sleeping bag when all of a sudden a bright light flooded my tent. My mind went to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", when Richard Draffus was sitting in his truck and this bright light shines down from the sky. I couldn't look at first, scared half out of my mind. Finally I look up and my phone, which was in the upper, corner pocket of the tent was getting a message that I had an update and was shining oh so brightly.

It was a tough start to the day! I told Bananas and Rachelle to go on ahead without me. It took me 6 hours to go the 6 miles to Dicks Creek Gap and they hiked it in half that time. Powell Mountain wasn't horrible but seemed unending. Then there was Snake Mountain, not bad at all but I was getting tired by then. When I got to Dicks Creek Gap who just happened to be there but my buddy, Ron, who Knobby and I met back at Cooper Gap, and several times since then. He gave me a free ride into Hiawassee. Knobby hiked with her grandson over the weekend to Dicks Creek Gap, while I was resting my knees and waiting for Tundra to be picked up. Then I started a day later than them and hiked through today and joined her at the Budget Inn. I got a much needed shower, did laundry, then Knobby and I went to Daniel's Steak House for dinner! It was delicious, just what the doctor ordered! On the way back to the hotel, we stopped at Ingles Grocery Store for supplies. It'll be about 5 days before we hit another town. While waiting for Knobby to finish her shopping I was watching cars come and go. I noticed that one car came and just sat there. People stopped and chatted with the elderly ladies (maybe in their 70's). So when Knobby came out of the store, she came over and sat down beside me and I asked her, ""Should I go over and asked those 2 ladies if they're going in our direction?"" She didn't object so over I went. I explained that we were 2 old broads hiking the AT, and inquired if they were going our way, as we were pooped out, and had groceries to cart. Also, I asked if they were waiting for someone. They responded, "" No, we aren't waiting for anyone, we just come up here and sit in the parking lot to watch people!"" They then gave us a ride! Thank you, Jo Ann and Fay! We got back to the hotel and worked on getting our packs repacked and ready for tomorrow We'll be leaving tomorrow morning, at 9am, on the hotel's shuttle to Dicks Creek Gap, to continue on up the trail.

So went to laundry room and dried a shirt I hand washed in the sink, as it was overlooked when I did my laundry yesterday. While waiting I popped into the small Outfitters at the Budget Inn. I wanted to up grade my poncho to a water proof jacket. I found one and put my poncho in the hickers box. Hiker boxes are at every hotel, hostel, etc., to give and take equipment and food as needed. I always peruse through the box and today I found a small tarp perfect for my tent entryway. We arrived at Dick's Creek Gap at 10:00 and headed north. We weren't on the trail a half hour before the rain started in, I was mighty happy in my new light weight rain jacket! It was a delightful leisurely day, not too demanding and we were only going 4 1/2 miles due to the late start. We arrived at Plumorchard at around 2:30. I was ecstatic because it was to be my first shelter experience. The shelter was new and accommodated up to14 people, we ended up with 11 for the night. It's a three story building, closed in on three sides. I stayed on the third floor because shelters are notorious for their mice, and I wanted to be the last stop for them. I can't say I slept very well between listening for mice and hearing a chorus of snoring. 
Met several new hikers around my age. Dynamite, a 71 year old lady, who is small in stature but big in character. She is in great shape, very into yoga and hiking. She hangs with the Gipper, an older man, with bad knees. Lucky Stars (from Texas) is a woman a little younger than me who might be looking for husband number four! Then there's PAM (Protector for all Mankind), a 55 year old lady who came by her name because she has left the trail to help fellow hikers in need a few times.

So to keep from switching places with anyone I just got up early with them. Knobby and I left for the trail around 7:15, the others early risers were still at the shelter for hours. Pam caught up with us and we hiked for quite a while together. Then on a long, steady incline Knobby had to rest and told us to go on. Pam and I hiked on crossing the Ga/NC border and on through the next two mountains. It was like North Carolina telling us ""Take that you Yankees"". Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald were by far harder than Blood Mountain! Just before the shelter we came to a spring and Pam suggested we soak our feet as we got our water! It was refreshing and very cold, my feet were numb within minutes! We arrived at Muskrat Creek Shelter around 4:00 greeted by Dynamite, the Gripper, and Lucky Stars (who chose to tent camp, evidently she didn't get any sleep the night before either), and a new guy named Jeff. It was like coming home and Pam and I claimed the last three spots, as it only slept 6. We told Knobby we'd save a spot for her if we made it in time. Shortly after we got there another guy came in, saw there were no openings and tented with Lucky Stars. I was happy to see Knobby and she arrived to everyone cheering for her! Everyone got in bed fairly early, like 7:30. It would turn out to be another restless night for me. Luckily, no mice made any appearances either shelter nights.","Plumorchard Shelter

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561278,"Slept in until 7:30, everyone was tired from the lack of sleep for two nights, on the trail by 8:40. It was a long day but steady day. We had a nice easy hike all morning and Knobby and I stayed close together. Standing Indian Mountain ended up not being as challenging to climb as we had first feared. But the day was long. As we were on the descent my knees started really bothering me. We hiked on for two an a half more miles before we finally found our camp spot at Beech Gap. I was in a great deal of pain as I set up my tent and made dinner. Lucky Stars came over when she arrived and ate with us. Knobby got the bear bag rope ready and after we ate Lucky Stars and I hung the bags. Just as I got to my tent it started raining! Phew! I was so glad to be snug in my sleeping bag as the rain came down! I slept somewhat restless that night as I decided to rub my aching legs down with Ben Gay that night and all I could think about was ""I just basted myself for the Bears"". Earlier that day or the day before I heard a story about a guy who went to sleep with coconut sun tanning oil on and a bear ripped open his tent to get at the yummy treat. The bear didn't hurt the guy but the authorities had to put the bear down but they got the wrong bear so they had to find and shoot the right bear. So because some idiot wore sun tanning lotion to bed two bears died! I was feeling like quite the ""idiot"" that night. Next morning I read the Ben Gay tube it said vanishing scent! I wonder...","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561279,"In the morning, we found out that Pam, Dyamite and the Gipper also stayed at Beech Gap only on the other side. They all took off early because that were doing a 12+ mile day. Knobby and I decided to hike to just before Albert Mountain, knowing it would be a hard mountain to get over. When we got up our tents were wet. We hung them up while we packed away everything else but still ended up packing them away wet. Ugh! The day wasn't too hard but my knees are a constant struggle. I been taking Aleve and about 8 vitamins a day to help. I've learned to use my hiking poles to lower myself down over steps and such to ease the pounding of descents. Also, if I bend my knees slightly while walking it helps a little.
For two days now we've hiked through the burned forest that happened last summer. It's so sad to see all the chard trees. You can still smell the burned wood. We stopped at Carter Gap Shelter for lunch it was nice. It's a new structure but only sleeps 8. Loved the broom someone made. We are passed several times a day but none so cute as a group of boys (8-11 years old), they call themselves the Green Brier Patch kids. They were adorable! Traveling at about 3 miles an hour, they marched right by us. Later in the day it started to rain and we caught up to them as they were getting on rain gear. We got ours out and on too and they were gone! As we came into Betty Creek Gap we could hear them long before we saw them. They were having a blast exploring the creek and forest. We set about getting our tents up in a cute little Mountain Laurel grove. As soon as my tent was up I laid in it for awhile just too tired and achy to care I was on hard ground. Then I blew up mattress pad and got sleeping bag situated, took some Aleve and laid down. I almost fell asleep but got dinner in me fast and then crashed by 4 pm. Slept all night as the rain came down!","Beech Gap

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561282,"We got up at 6:30 with the sun. Packed up quickly and got right on the trail by 7:20. We had an easy start as the trail meandered through the forest and around mountain sides. We got to Albert Mountain base by 10:40 and spent the next 1 1/2 hours climbing .3 miles up to 5250' summit. To say it was hard would be an understatement. It was mountain climbing, not mountain hiking. Several parts had us throwing our hiking poles forward as we pushed or pulled ourselves over boulders. It was a challenge for us ""mature"" ladies for sure! When we reached the top there was a Fire Tower. It was very tall. I climbed three flights up but the wind was so strong and I was so scared I couldn't go the last flight. I took pictures and scurried down. Knobby ate lunch while I climbed then we started the 6.1 mile descent to Rock Gap. Shortly after leaving the fire tower we came to the 100 mile marker, marked by someone with stones in the shape of 100! We took pictures then hiked fast. We covered 2 miles in the first hour but then we had to slow down. I phoned the Budget Inn and made arrangements for pick up at Rock Gap at 5:00. We had 3 1/2 hours to do 4.1 miles. As the clock ticked down we scurried to get there but my left knee was screaming, then my right foot was shooting pain, then my left heel's Plantar Fasciitis flared up! I was a hot mess! I prayed over and over for God to give me strength, determination and perseverance as I hobbled step by step down the mountain. I cried hysterically and uncontrollably several times but then scolded myself (out loud, mind you) to get a grip because I couldn't see the trail with tears in my eyes. I taped up my knee with athletic tape to give it more stability and strength. I grunted and moaned a lot as the pain was almost unbearable but continued on. I prayed for God to send me an angel to help me. At two different times guys offered to carry my back pack down the rest of the way but I turned them down. I was thinking unless you are carrying me with it, it really doesn't help me because my pack wasn't bothering me in the least. Finally, the last 500 feet I allowed a guy to carry it. Knobby even asked if I wanted to stay at the Long Branch shelter as we were passing it but I said no let's keep going. I knew I had to get down off the mountain and quick because I was out of food, toilet paper, baby wipes, clean clothes and longed for a shower and any food not dehydrated. Well after 3 1/2 long, excruciating hours I finally made it down with 4 minutes to spare. I told Knobby ""See, I knew we could do it). I had to joke or break down sobbing, I chose the former. We had a van full of 6 smelly hikers, it was quite a trip! Got to our rooms and collapsed, then we ordered pizza and got showers. Will go to Angel Urgent Care tomorrow. Maybe this is the angel he chose to send???","Betty Creek Gap

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561429,"It was so good to sleep in doors as the rain has been non stop here! Slept in until 8:30 which was wonderful! When I got up I immediately took my laundry to the laundry room and got it started so I could get dressed for the day. Usually while doing laundry hikers wear their rain gear but I have an extra pair of shorts now that I put on with my rain coat. You can see a thru-hiker a mile away and sometimes smell them too! When I went back to switch my clothes to the dryer, my neighbor next door (also a hiker) noticed I was limping and asked if he could take a look. He told me he was a doctor and I said let me switch my laundry around first, so I could think about it, as it was a little odd. Knobby and I agreed he must be a chiropractor so when I came back I let him take a look. He adjusted it and it really did help. Thank you Lord for having our paths cross! I decided that my Air Force boots might be hurting my feet, actually I think someone else mentioned it to me yesterday. So I went on the Budget Inn shuttle to the Outfitters Store and bought a new pair of boots. Hopefully my feet pain will magically disappear! Also got new trekking poles as I've been using broken poles for two weeks now and have blisters on my thumbs as a result. Occasionally my poles would giggle loose, unlock and collapse while I was hiking. That could seriously be a hazard on the mountain terrain we hike on. Then the shuttle dropped a few of us off at a diner for lunch. I joined Dynamite and Grippers for hamburgers. We walked back to the Budget Inn but we stopped in at a smaller Outfitters Store and I bought a new knee brace. The Chiropractor recommended a certain kind and I'm trying everything I can to insure I don't go home! Hope the new gear helps! Came back to room and laid out wet tent and gear so it could dry. At 4:00 the shuttle made its daily run to Walmart for food and stuff. I bought five days worth of food but I'm not super happy with my choices. Good thing I will get another resupply box at the next stop.Came back to room and started packing everything up, food, tent, clean clothes, etc... Haven't really rested my leg much today so now I sit with a cold water blader on knee and foot. Well, it's late and I must get to bed. Had fun talking to my granddaughter, Kaitlyn, my sister and all my children (except Jessica, as she's not where there's cell service). Next time I hope to do less running around and more face-timing with grand babies! Love and miss you all!","Rock Gap

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561540,"Another day off! Knobby and I, went to breakfast with Dynamite and Gipper. As we were eating and watching the weather we all decided to take another day off, as it was going to rain all day again. We will leave at 9am on the shuttle back to Rock Gap and continue our journey.After breakfast, I went to the Outfitters Store and got a UPS box to mail some stuff home. While there I asked if they had a scale so I could weigh my backpack. They did. I also bought another food bag, this one water proof, a buff, and sock liners. Then went back to room and filled box. Walked back to the Outfitters, this time with my fully loaded backpack, and mailed my box. I then weighed myself, my pack, and my fanny pack. I was pretty excited as I've lost another 10lbs, 20lbs total since January, and I've gotten my backpack weight down to 26.8lbs. I started with a 40lb pack. My fanny pack weighs 3.4lbs. I will be carrying about 4lbs. of water. So, pack will weigh 30.8 with 2 liters of water.Walked to post office and mailed a letter, then walked to the ""Mixer"" and had a coke and ate a taco. Went back to room and got to talk to Jessica. Then the 4 of us went to dinner at the Hiker's Brewery. I had texted Pam earlier and asked her where she was, and as we were sitting there she called me and asked where we were. Then 5 minutes later Pam and Lucky Stars walked in. We had a fun time playing catch up and then we went outside to order food from a food truck. Got a couple good pictures of all of us. Hope we see them again on down the line but they're 11 miles ahead of us so time will tell. We walked back to the hotel and are ready for bed. Hope my knee and foot don't give me trouble tomorrow.","Budget Inn

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561653,"Well, I didn't get very far today. Instead of going to clinic today, I decided to test out my new boots and poles and see if they would be enough. They weren't. Woke up around 7:30, got a shower, packed up, took shuttle to Rock Gap. There are two exits for Franklin, Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap. Between the two gaps there is a 3.7 mile stretch. So I knew I could try out my rested knees and feet to see how they'd do without being stranded if things went south. There was about a mile of up, a mile of straight, and then a mile of down. I managed the first two ok but I definitely struggled a lot on the down. So as I was hiking I was running scenarios through my head. Do I go home? Do I try to go to the VA clinic here in Franklin? Do I go to Angel Care Urgent Clinic? Do I go to the ER at the hospital? Should I go to the hostel? Back to Budget Inn? Well, after I got to Winding Stair Gap, Betty Crocker and Butter Bear, two women, around 30-40, I met while hiking today had a ride with close family friends (of Betty's) and were just getting backpacks in the trunk of the car. They saw me and asked if I had a ride and when I said I didn't the 71 year old lady, who was driving, said come on we'll give you a ride to town. Then we all went out to eat at ""Boilers Steakhouse"", which was awesome! The two ladies that drove from Ashville to help out Betty Crocker were so sweet, and one of them paid for all of us. Then they took me to the Budget Hotel. The hotel was full but they had room in the hostel across the street, so that is where I am for the night. Butter Bear will be here later too but is running errands with Betty Crocker right now. I called the Foot Clinic and the VA clinic when I got here, both were closed but will go to one of them tomorrow.","Rock Gap

I am going to fly home Friday and rest and recuperate and possibly return after Memorial Day. During that time I will try and see a few specialist to determine if my left knee needs surgery, a new brace or just rest. Pretty certain my right foot has a stress fracture and I think it just needs time to heal. I will go back to my podiatrist and have him make a mold of my foot for better Plantar F. inserts. If I don't make it back this year then I'll try next year. Thanks to all of you who read my blog and sent encouraging words. I will miss the AT.","Winding Stair Gap

Journey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562234,"Sitting at the airport, flight delayed. Typed my whole blog already then swiped the wrong way and deleted it. Having one of those days. But I wanted to tell you a crazy story that happened yesterday.Butter Bear(BB) and I walked to downtown Franklin yesterday and had fun going in and out of cute little shops. She needed some items from the 76 Hikers store so we spent quite a few minutes there. Then we decided to get coffee and cookies from a shop around the corner. We were at the register and the owner was asking us a hundred questions about our AT adventure. She rang me up for 2 cookies and a coffee, $8 and change, I give her a $20, and got change. Then she rings BB up, who got 3 cookies and coffee, owner says that'll be $13 and change. We look at each other, then she asks about the $5 difference. Just then I glance down at the money I got back from my $20 and I'm short a $5. The owner fixes hers and mine and we all had a good laugh about it. Honest mistake! I was juggling several bags now from different shops and I was trying to consolidate them when I look down and saw I was holding a $43 pillow from the 76 Hikers store, the same one I bought at REI, it's only about 3""x2"" big, anyway I was so embarrassed and again we all laughed! What's going on here??? Anyway, we made a mad dash back to the store before the police came to haul me away! The guy at the store was grateful and although my airport adventure is somewhat irritating, I'm glad I'm here and not behind bars!","Franklin
