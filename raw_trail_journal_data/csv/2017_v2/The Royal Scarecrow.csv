The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555624,"Hi, my name is Jeff. I am going to use this journal to record my “Thru-hike” of the Appalachian Trail in 2017. I haven't written. A journal in over 20 years so please forgive me if I get wordy or long winded. Hopefully these will get better as my hike progresses. This first post is about how my journey began.In May of 2016, Amy and I visited Hungry Mother State Park in Southwest Virginia. During our time there, we went to a small town called Damascus and traveled on the Virginia Creeper Trail, an old railroad bed that has been converted into a 34 mile bicycle and hiking trail. It crosses the Appalachian Trail several times and we saw a lot of backpackers hiking the ""AT"". It turns out we missed a backpacker's festival called ""Trail Days"" by just 2 days. The festival is mainly centered around a subset of backpackers known a ""Thru-hikers"". These are people who are trying to hike the entire ""AT"" (or some other long distance trail like the Pacific Crest Trail - ""PCT"" or Continental Divide Trail - ""CDT"") in a single year. Apparently about 2000 people a year try to Thru-hike the 2100 mile Appalachian Trail - ""AT"" each year, but only about 500 people actually complete the journey. Most of these hikers start at Springer Mountain in Georgia and hike towards Mt. Katahdin in Maine. These folks are referred to as North Bounders or NOBOs. However, some people hike from Maine to Georgia (South Bounders or SOBOs) and a few will start in the middle hike to Maine then transport back to the middle and then hike to Georgia (this is known as a Flip-flop.)I have always loved hiking, camping and anything outdoor related but I have never been backpacking. Amy and I started talking about the possibility of me doing something like hiking the AT one day. We had been planning a trip to Canada for the summer of 2017 but it turns out that neither of us we as excited about it as we should have been. Anyway, we both read a few books and blogs and then watched a movie or two about long distance hikes. Before long we decided that Canada could wait and now would be a great time for me attempt an AT thru hike. I had retired at a fairly young age, the kids had just moved out of the house, I had quit smoking a few years back and gotten myself into what I felt was pretty good shape so it just seemed like the timing was perfect. Amy, who always has my back, was on board and very encouraging and even seemed to be excited about meeting me at stops along the trail for visits and to help resupply me.Ultimately, I decided that doing a NOBO thru hike of the AT is something that I really wanted to do. Many people talk about going on amazing adventures but very few get the chance and even fewer people take advantage of the opportunity when it presents itself. I am not going to let this opening pass me by.",,My first preparation journal,"Dec 05, Mon",0
The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555625,"So jump foward to early June of 2016, I had been researching backpacking equipment for a couple weeks and thought I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to buy for my backpacking set up. It just so happened that a REI (Recreational Equipment Inc) opened in Virginia Beach just as I was ready to buy my gear. Timing couldn't be more perfect! Amy and I jumped in the car and head to the store. If you have never been to a REI, and you do anything outdoor related, you owe it to yourself to check this place out! It has an awesome selection and they seem to hire people with lots of outdoor activity experience. As Amy and I are looking at packs a nice young lady comes over and offers to help us. Packs come in a huge range of sizes, styles and weights and have to be custom fit to each person. She tells us that she can do that for us right there. It turns out that she just thru hiked the AT in 2015 and is giving a class on AT backpacking in a few weeks. Awesome! Amy and I pick her brain about every piece of gear we can think of and about how the logistics of a thru hike work and she spends a few hours patiently answering every question. I tell her what equipment I plan to buy and she comments that the gear I chose is good but I may want to try to get items that are a bit lighter. I feel like I am in pretty good shape and would rather be more comfortable and carry a few more ounces here and there. I get a nice big comfortable pack, sleeping bag and pad. Some big sturdy boots, and lots of warm clothes. She politely smiles and says that everyone hikes different and that I should always ""Hike my own hike."" A phase I will come to hear a lot in the coming months. I don't bother to weigh anything, I figure if it all fits in the pack, I will be fine......",,Let's get some gear!!!,"Dec 10, Sat",0
The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555626,"Fast forward to July 2016. I have everything I think I need for backpacking. Nice big sturdy pack, (It's only a few pounds more but its so comfortable and big enough for anything I want to carry), a nice thick warm sleeping bag, (A few pounds more than some of the others but I want to be comfortable right), a thick large inflatable sleeping pad (only 8 ounces more than the smaller one but comfort comes 1st right)' Anyone noticing a pattern here????? Yeah but I am in pretty good shape for my age so a little more weight shouldn't be an issue right? Well I set up my camp in the backyard a few times and I think I am ready to do a field trial. I want to make sure that I like everything I bought before I set out for 5 months on the AT. I decide to go to Crabtree Falls and spend a few nights on the Appalachian Trail.I drive the 5 hours to the Crabtree Falls parking lot arriving around 1 pm, jump out, throw on my pack with a smile on my face and start heading up the 3.5 mile hill towards the AT. It's a nice warm day and it doesn't take long before I am soaked in sweat and breathing hard but I am truly enjoying the challenge and the falls are beautiful. It takes me about 2 hours to reach the AT intersection and it's time for me to decide which way to go. South to Spy Rock or North to The Priest shelter. I decide to hike north to The Priest and do Spy Rock the next day. I make it to the Priest Shelter, passing a few other day hikers heading south along the way. It only takes about an hour. Just before I get there I notice the outside of my left knee is getting a little sore. There are 4 people at the shelter when I arrive. Three are recent college grads and one is a thru hiker who's trail name is PBS. (His shirt has Public Broadcasting System logo on it) I share some of my homemade venison jerky and dehydrated fruit and we all sit and chat for about an hour. PBS heads north and the college grads invite me to hike up to the overlook near Priest. It's early so I tag along. The foliage is very thick so the view isn't all that good but it was a nice hike. I leave them and hike back to Priest shelter. It's still only about 5 pm and it's kind of buggy at this shelter so I decide to head over to Spy Rock and set up camp there. My knee is still a bit sore but I figure I will just suck it up and hike through it.By the time I reach Spy Rock my knee is hurting so bad that I am moving real slow and limping. There are plenty of places to pitch my tent but I realize there is no water source nearby and i only had one bottle left. So I check my AWOL guide and see that the Seeley Woodworth shelter wasn't too far and had a reliable water source. I decide to march on as I want to be near a shelter so I can meet other people and set up my tent there. I have never been backpacking so I just want to be near others that can help if I screw things up. I get there about about 7 pm and there are about 9 people hanging around the shelter. It is a 6 person shelter and full but several hammocks and tents are set up around it. I find a spot nearby and setup my tent then head over to the table near the shelter for dinner. While I am boiling my water I talk to the others there. Three ladies are there from Florida. They said that one of them went through some personal trouble then saw the movie ""Wild"" and decided they need to do a week long hike on the AT so she could ""find herself"". One lady named Shelly said she chose the trail name Mary Ott cause she her next night out would be at the Marriott and her friend would have to ""find herself"" on the way back to the car tomorrow. Another guy named Steve was a thru hiker that didn't speak much and 4 others where section hikers that weren't very friendly didn't even respond to me when I said hi. So Shelly, her friends and I talk until dark then I realize I didn't hang my bear bag. Shelly tells me I can use there bear line and helps me hang my bag. I thank them and turn in for the night. The next morning everyone is up about the same time, eating or backing up. The section hikers are their normal unfriendly selves and don't speak to the rest of us at all but leave before the rest of us. The ladies, Steve and I eat our breakfast and say goodbyes. As we get ready to leave camp we notice that the section hikers left 5 water bottles behind by accident and have been gone too long for us to catch up to them. Isn't karma amazing? My left knee seems ok at first but quickly begins to hurt again. I saw a few nice campsites along the Crabtree Falls and decide to head back that way just in case it gets worse. It turns out to be the right decision. Within 30 minutes I am limping hard. The more I proceed downhill the more it hurts and then the right knee starts up. About halfway back to the car I stop at a campsite and eat lunch while trying to decide what to do next. I actually setup my tent and laid down for a couple hours then decided to pack it all up and head home.By the time I get back to my car I am moving at a snails pace and have tears in my eyes from the pain in both knees. Maybe this adventure is just not something that I am physically capable of achieving.......",,Maybe I'm not as ready as I think I am!,"Dec 16, Fri",0
The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555629,"OK so now it's August. It only took about 2 days for my knee pain to disappear and I decide that I am not ready to throw in the towel just yet. I go the doctor and he checks me out says everything looks good and says I might want to try take an anti-inflammatory and some glucosamine. I also do some research and find that my issue is most likely an IT band problem. (It's a large ligament that connects the upper hip to the knee area.) I learn that it's usually caused by trying to do too much too fast and can be fixed using some stretching technics. I also take everything back to REI and LL Bean (just love their return policies! ) and start over with my gear weight in mind this time. Now my pack is less than 30 lbs including all winter clothes and food for 4 days and water. I also start exercising all lot more. I am determined to lose 20 lbs before November. My Fitness Pal and Mapmyfitness are awesome apps to help track workouts and calorie intake and output! Amy and I have also discussed doing a camp hosting gig for a few years so I go on the Virginia State Parks volunteer website and see that Douthat SP in the Allegheny mountains has an opening for November. So I sign up. Basically Camp Hosts help monitor the campground and do light cleanup or maintenance (about 30 hours a week) in exchange for a free camp site for the month. I figure it will give me a great opportunity to hike the mountains everyday and test out my new gear. My goal to strengthen my legs to a point where I can do 20 miles a day.So that's the plan, tune in to my next post to see how it turns out.",,Nor quitting just yet!,"Jan 13, Fri",0
The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555628,"Things went great in September and October with my workouts and I got down to 155 lbs and felt awesome. I was running 5 miles with no issues and my upper body hadn't been this fit since I was in my 20s. Between the glucosamine and some anti-inflammatories, I am virtually pain free. I am also trying to finishing all the odd projects around home that I have been putting off for unknown reasons. I had mixed emotions when preparing to leave for Douthat State Park. Amy and I had never been apart for more than 2 weeks at a time and it felt strange leaving for fun and not work. The good news is that she worked out her schedule so that she could come to visit at least once and maybe twice while I was there and the park office said that I could leave for a few days around Thanksgiving so we would see each other then too. But since it is 5 hours from our home I still felt a bit guilty that Amy would have to make the trip there and back alone. Also my hunting season at home so far had been unsuccessful and leaving when things were just ramping up was weighing on me. Fortunately the state park is surrounded by national forests and the season would open while I was there. In the meantime I had also been stock piling some ""hiking"" food. I got some freezes dried meals from Walmart, and hit some sales for ramen noodles, nutragrain bars, pop tarts and a few other items. I also started dehydrating all kinds of food like jerky and fruits at home. Hiking food is food that is high in calories, weighs as little as possible, is shelf stable, and easy to prepare with just boiling water or doesn't require any prep at all. Calories per ounce is how most long distance hikers decide on food choices. There is really no need to take more than 4 days worth of food at any time in most cases when on the AT as there are many towns that are close to the trail or right on the trail where I can resupply. But many of these locations are expensive and have poor selections and when I am burning 7000 calories a day I will be spending a lot on food. So Amy is going to be sending me food and supply boxes at certain places to cut costs and add variety. This is done by sending packages to either post offices or hostels along the trail ahead of time that will hold them until I get there. Some hikers send all their packages to themselves before they head out. Obviously this takes some serious planning and many assumptions on their part. I have no idea what I will want to eat half way through my hike so I am very grateful to have Amy's support. So I bought some things that I think I will like to try out at Douthat. I plan to set up my gear a couple times, eat and sleep outdoors when there too so I can get a feel for what works and what doesn't. And of course I want to hike as much as I can every day to prepare my body for the upcoming adventure.....",,Still training and tweaking gear,"Jan 23, Mon",0
The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555933,"The first day on the trail was great. Late and chilly start but everything worked out fine. I went from Springer to Hightower Gap. About 10.5 miles easy miles. And my beautiful wife was there to pick me up like planned. It was pretty crowded about 30 people on the trail. But it was still very easy to separate yourself if you wanted some alone time as everyone was spread out nicely. Some of the other hikers I met were Magic Mick, Bing Ninja, Trek, Explicit, Rictic and his wife (cant remember her trail name), Chris and his dad Mike, CJ and Brian, Grumpy, Goforth, John, Jim, Dooley, Kango?, and a few others who's names I don't remember. I passed by most of them quickly since I was not carrying much weight and only got to speak briefly with each. But most seems very nice.

The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555934,"Arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park last night! Just barely beat a thunderstorm with some hail. Amy, Bella and I are all snuggled into a great cabin. The real fun starts in just a few hours! I've been up since 2:30 am. I'm way too excited to sleep. So Bella and I went for a walk in the dark across the street and found the arch at the entrance to the approach trail behind the visitor center. It's a 8.5 mile trail that leads to the southern terminus of the AT on top of Springer Mountain in GA. Around 8 am Amy is going to drive me a point about 2/3 the way down that trail and I am going to begin my journey. For the next 5 days she is going to bring me to the trail then pick me up at a road crossing 10 or 12 miles further down the trail and take me back to the cabin, then take me to where I left off the next morning and so forth. Since I won't be sleeping or eating breakfast and dinner on the trail these 5 days, I will be leaving most of my gear / supplies at the cabin while I hike. This is called slackpacking. Some purist thru hikers frown upon it but it's how I want to start so that I can spend a little more time with Amy and attend the AT Kickoff Party here at Amicalola this weekend. I have already met quite a few hikers that have completed the thru hike before and several will be here this weekend, along with some legends in the hiking community, vendors, food, seminars and of course other people that are getting ready to start their thru hikes too. Slackpacking will also give my legs time to adjust to hiking mountains again. A lot of people, around 25% of the 2000+ hikers that attempt a thru hike on the AT each year, give up within the first 50 miles. Many times its because they try to push themselves too hard, too far or carry too much weight at first. I know I can hike 20 miles with a full pack no problem because I have already done it several times, but doing that day in and day out for days, weeks and months on end is very different and it's easy to injury yourself and end your trip quickly if you don't pace yourself properly. Anyway I will post some more pics and a video or 2 in a day or so.",,Morning Jitters,"Mar 02, Thu",0

Hightower Gap (mile marker 8.6) to Woody Gap 
(Mile marker 20.8) 
The weather was really nice for hiking again . Amy dropped me off at 9 am and it was about 32 degrees and windy out but the sun was shining and I had a decent climb right away so I warmed up almost immediately. I passed a lot of hikers that were just waking up and packing up camp. The first ones I saw were Magic Mick and Bling Ninja. They seemed to be moving slow but in great spirits. About halfway through the day I stopped at Gooch Mountain Shelter for lunch and met a section hiker named 6 mile. He was from Detroit and was an avid Ironman competition guy. He had already done many of the northern states and had a conference in Atlanta so he figured it would be a great time for the GA section. While we chatted at the shelter another older gentleman wandered up. His trail name was JW which was advertised in giant letters on the front of his shirt. And something happened that I never would have guessed would happen on the trail. JW actually stands for Jehova Witness and yeah you guessed it, he was there to witness to everyone on the trail. He started trying to convince us that his religion had the greatest app ever made and that downloading it would most likely save our eternal souls. I tried to change the subject a few times but to no avail. After a few minutes 6 mile and I packed up and politely started to head out. Then I realized that I had saw some trash in the corner of the shelter and wanted to carry it out since I was slackpacking. Well JW started asking about upcoming water sources and road crossings so I took out my Guthook app and told him what it said. About 10 minutes later I headed out again. 6 mile and I got along really well and I wanted to catch up and hike with him awhile so I turned on the afterburners. It was about 4.5 miles to Woody Gap but I figured I would catch him in about 2 miles. It took me more than 3 to finally meet back with him, this dude can really move. We hiked and chatted the rest of the way to Woody and he kept up with me easily. I was seriously impressed. We separated at Woody Gap since Amy was there to meet me and bumped into Trek again in the parking lot. Trek is on his 9th AT thru hike. And offered up a lot of good advice. Then Amy and I came back to Amicalola and went up to the lodge to see some friends we made at the Southern Ruck. We saw Tinman, Nimbus, Wingheart, Greybeard and a few others that were just setting up their booths and starting to sell stuff. Tinman was actually sharing a booth with AWOL (David Miller) who is the author of a book and the most popular guidebook on the AT. (Like 20k copies a year ! ) Tinman and I get along great so I told them to come by the cabin for a drink when they finished up. We browsed the booths for a bit longer then headed back to the cabin just as they were walking up. 
At the Soruck I introduced Tinman to Crown Royal Regal Apple and he was hooked and very pleased to learn I had brought more. We all sat, drank, and chatted for several hours until well past hiker midnight (generally hiker midnight is about 8pm in March and 9 pm in the summer) but I decided to take zero mile day on Saturday to enjoy the festivities so I didn't mind at all.","Hightower Gap

We went up to the lodge just to chat with other hikers and check out gear. I hung out at the tent city campsite next to our cabin and met some great people! Big thanks to Peace Seeker and his wife Jennifer for the great chili and blackberry cobbler! And thanks to Odie for organizing the event. Then we turned in early so I could attempt a big mile day to make up for the zero.","

Woody Gap to Tensatee Gap.So for my last day of slackpacking I thought I should make it count and do some crazy miles.Blood mountain is so beautiful!   Lots of tourists on the weekends especially when the weather is perfect for a day hike! I hiked a good bit from Blood to Neels Gap with Bowler, Matt, Ricola, Grasshopper and Cricket. We all stopped at a hiker feed put on by Wildfire (2016 thruhiker) at Neels Gap. Mountain Crossings was very cool. The big tree with the boots hanging from it is where many hikers quit the trail and throw their boots up as a last gesture. Then I pushed on for awhile alone. The terrain wasn't bad but you head cold was getting worse. But I was still loving every minute.   I wanted to go to Hogpen Gap but I hit another hiker feed at Tensatee and ran out of steam. Big thanks to those 2 cool guys fed me well and kept me company until Amy picked me up. We went back to the cabin, I ate a plate of leftovers and crashed so hard!","Woody Gap

The Royal Scarecrow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555938,"Monday, March 6, 2017Tensatee gap to Blue Mountain ShelterAbout 13 miles.Today is the day Amy drops me off and leaves to go back home. It's also my first day wearing ""my big boy pack"" . The climb from Tensatee gap to Hogpen gap is a crazy steep 1 mile up and down, so Amy takes pity on me and let's me slack pack on last time since the parking lots are only about 1/4 mile apart. Then we say our goodbyes for the next 6 - 8 weeks or so, and I watch her drive off. It's a very weird feeling watching someone you have spent so much time with leave for what you know will be an extended time. We will still communicate most days but for the last 4 or 5 years I have seen her almost every day. I will miss the way her hair smells and the warmth of her body next to me each night. I will miss the mornings when I impatiently wait for her to wake up so I can ramble on about whatever crazy crap that happens to be stirring in my head. I will miss everything about her. But she is going to visit me a few times during my hike and I know she will be there when this journey is over and I can only hope that looking forward to seeing her again will be enough to sustain me.      The rest of the day goes great. My legs hold up fantastic and I am still passing several hikers during the day even though I am definitely slower than when I slack packed. I even see a few hikers that I ran into on previous days. When I arrive at Blue Mountain Shelter its only about 2 or 3 pm but there is a group of about 10 others already there but I don't know any of them . They are a great bunch and immediately make me feel welcome.   We all sit around a fire and laugh about the crazy nothings of life and cook and eat our random dinners. A few more stragglers hike in and fall right into the mix. JW (who has totally calmed down the religious banter and is actually a good guy) and Raven are among them. I hiked a good portion of the morning with Raven and she is a very good conversationalist. Around 6:30 it's like an alarm goes off and everyone retreats instinctively to their tents, hammocks or shelter and it dead quiet by 7:30 pm. I am very glad I decided to tent camp that night as my cold kept me up hacking and coughing for all but about 2 or 3 hours. I won't stay in the shelters while I have this cold. It does make the hiking tougher for sure and I don't want to spread it. Since I can't sleep, I am the 1st one up and gone in the morning.","Tensaree Gap

Head cold beat me down again today and it turned out to be a hard 11 mile day. The terrain wasn't bad I just seemed to lack energy and spirit. I needed a little break so I decided to stay at ToG and get shower. Top of Georgia is super clean, nice and organized. Bob broke his rules and agreed to let me tent out back since I was sick and gave me a price break too. They did my laundry for 5 bucks and gave me some scrubs to wear in the mean time which I wore when I took the free shuttle to Hiawassee and ate a a AYCE cafeteria that was a good deal for the money. Came back and hung out with some of the hikers from Blue Mountain in the bunk room while they organized their food supplies. It was actually much more entertaining than you would think.

ToG is very nice and I think it's a fair deal and Bob is definitely trying hard to keep everyone happy and educated on how to be a successful thru hiker. Breakfast was cold cereal and milk. Delicious and free! And I drank several free coffees as well. He shuttled a few of us at 8 am back to Dicks Creek and we headed out. Most stayed and waited for the 9 am. I hiked alone for most the day but passed several others as usual. The day really seemed to drag on until I hit the GA line. That was an awesome moral booster, for about a half mile. Then I got my ass handed to me by every hill up to Muskrat Creek. North Carolina was by far 3 times harder than anything GA had. About 35 hikers all congregated around Muskrat Creek Shelter. We were all rewarded with an amazingly beautiful sunset.Great freaking day. I feel I am starting to earn this adventure.Someone tries to give me the trail name ""Scarecrow"" since my pack doesn't have a brain and Legs calls me ""Royal"" because I gave her some of my regal apple to sooth a bad cough she had. I tell them I will consider them both. Lots of great people around the fire and cooking table. Great conversations going around. Darwin and Legs are probably the 2 most charismatic hikers that I have met. And they have some great adventures under their belt for their age. Good Witch and her group roll in about 5. She is a seriously funny girl. As is Thread and PopPop. I turn in around 8 pm. As I close my eyes I think ""One state down! Thirteen to go!""","Top of Georgia Hostel
