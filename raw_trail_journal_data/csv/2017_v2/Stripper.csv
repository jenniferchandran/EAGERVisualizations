Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555764,"It is that time of year again when I begin the countdown to my hike. I am planning on doing Harper's Ferry to Gorham, NH this summer. I will have Mama Bear and Sherpa with me part of the time and then they will leave the trail and I will continue on. This summer's hike will not be like any other hike because I had Bariatric surgery in December and I have lost 40 pounds since then. I am working on losing 20-30 more before I head out on May 21. It will be hard in the beginning to figure out how many calories I need to eat, how to manage my protein intake and also water intake since my stomach is now so small. It will be an adventure either way.",,75 Days and counting!,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555765,"This has always been an issue. I am constantly changing my hiking gear out and going lighter each time. I have my base weight down to about 15 pounds, which I'm really good with. I am right at 20 pounds with 5 days worth of food and water. I'm excited to be heading out soon. I will miss my husband and dogs, but I'm ready to hike.",,Gear Selection,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555766,"I am working on getting all the food together that I will need. I have to have 50 grams of protein each and every day and trying to get that without carrying 50 pounds of food will be challenging, but I am very confident that I will be able to get what I need done. I am going to take tuna for lunch and also freeze dried chicken in order to get as much as I need. It will be a challenge, but one that I'm looking forward to.",,Food Prep,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556028,"I received my new Thermarest Neo Air last night and I already know for a fact that Mama Bear isn't gonna want to sleep next to me in the shelters (if I don't hammock) because it is very crinkly! It will be somewhat noisy, but for the first time in years I can lie on my stomach, with my head on the mattress and my toes stay on the pad. I am VERY excited about that! I will be working on weighing everything and getting a ballpark on what my base weight is. It should be less than 20 pounds. And I'm excited about that!!",,Gear (again),"Mar 10, Fri",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556150,"I'm working on how to work out a good schedule to hike with Mama Bear and then jump up to hike with Mrs. Joy as well. I think I have a good plan to accomplish both, but it will take some doing. My summer would be way more enjoyable if I am able to work out hiking with both. I will be able clean up some small sections that I have skipped for one reason or another. I'm excited about this summer's hike because at the end of it I will make my annual trip to my son's house and I will have a new grand baby when I get there!",,Working on schedules,"Mar 11, Sat",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556190,"I have added the most important pieces of my gear. I have been collecting/buying gear for many years and I think I have a good and very lightweight combination now. As the years have passed, the osteoarthritis has gotten much worse, so I am excited to be in a hammock and off the ground. I will add the weight up later, but I think I'm down to about 15 pounds base weight, which I am extremely happy about.",,Gear Added,"Mar 12, Sun",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556405,"We will be hitting the trail in Harper's Ferry on May 20th and I am stoked! I am so excited to be hiking this summer--I cannot even begin to put it into words! My pack weight is down and I have lost about 45 pounds, so I should be able to hike longer without pain. I'm still working on the logistics on the hike, but i'm getting it together and that makes me very excited! I love the planning almost as much as I love the hike itself. Even though I will be hiking this section for the third time, I know it will not be the same. Every time on the trail it is totally different and that is part of what keeps me going back.","

Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556406,"We will hit the trail on May 20th and I cannot wait. I am so excited this year because I have lost right at 45 pounds now. My base weight is about 15 pounds too, so I should be able to hike much longer without pain for the first time in years. I am still working on the logistics of the hike and that is almost as exciting to me as the hike itself. Even though I will be hiking the same sections I have hiked twice before I know that it will not be the same. The trail is always different and speaks to me in different ways. The people are never the same, except for Karey and Heidi. I am so ready to hike!","

Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559548,I have now dropped 50 pounds since Dec of 2016 and I have been working out almost every single day. I am more ready to hike than I ever have been. I cannot wait to hit the trail! I have the majority of my food drops done and ready to go; although I still have to label them and get them shipped out. I honestly believe that this year will be my best hiking year yet! I have been so very blessed this year so far and I cannot wait to see what God has in store for the rest!,,Getting it done!,"Apr 10, Mon",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561218,"In just 4 weeks (I know it's so gonna fly by) I will be back on the trail that I love. I will be with friends that I love while missing my loved ones at home. I am ready to head out again to recharge my batteries, so to speak, find my place in light of God's word, become a better person, and to just ""be still"" so I can know that He is God.",,Only four more weeks to go before I hit the trail!,"Apr 22, Sat",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564594,I am so blessed to be a mother and grandmother and thankful for all my children.  I am so excited to be able to go hiking.  I am just about ready.  I still have to finalize my schedule for the second half of my hike and get those mail drops done and in the mail.  I fly out of here on Saturday and hit the trail that night.  I said goodbye to my church family tonight and will get to have dinner with my daughter and grandson on Tuesday.  Then my husband is taking a few days off so we can have time together and then I'm off!  I'm excited and ready.,,View Entry,"May 14, Sun",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577633,"I had some technical difficulties this past summer with my journal--and I just now figured out what happened!  This summer we hiked from Harpers Ferry to Port Clinton and had an absolute ball!  For me personally, this was the absolute best summer of hiking!  I dropped right at 75 pounds before I hit the trail and now have lost a total of 90 pounds.  We hiked about 10 miles per day, which was very nice for us.  We are seriously considering going back to New Hampshire and Maine in 2018, which could complete the AT for me. I did upload some photos so you could see what a great time we did have!",,View Entry,"Sep 13, Wed",0
