Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551913,"I would like to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY! to my husband, Mike. He is my best friend who I and our kids can always count on in rain, snow, wind and blistering heat to fix endless tires, pull cars out of snow banks (in Ohio), put up shelves, get cars out of impound (LOL), play endless card games, get us free hotels rooms, move furniture and just be there for us. He is never in a bad mood (how can that be). If we succeed in this upcoming adventure (hiking the ATO it will be because of him and his constant CHEERING AND ENCOURAGEMENT and probably dragging me up those mountains! Thank you Mike and Happy Birthday!PLUS I would like to give a big Shout Out to Patagonia - They are donating 100% of black Friday profits ""to the environment"" . Rose Marcario, Patagonia President and CEO writes, ""Much of the insanity around Black Friday is about getting the right gifts for children, but she argues that the best gift we can give our kids is a healthy planet."" YEAH! Plus their coats are awesome.Peace Everyone!","

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552000,"Hello Everyone!I need to change my status to ""Pre-Hike"" or ""Getting Ready"". 2017 is fast approaching with so much to do. My husband and I are practicing and researching. Next week we are visiting our daughters in Georgia and are going to hike the approach train at Amicalola Falls. We have been there several times - only doing the steps. Living in flat West Texas its hard to find many hills (of course there are not mountains) steep enough to adequately practice. We have hiked Quitaque many times - some successful - some NOT so successful (sometimes leaving with the attitude of I HATE HIKING - NEVER AGAIN!! *!#!* etc...)My husband is very athletic - he doesn't need to practice or get ready. He could leave tomorrow and fly right on through those 2000+ miles. Its me that needs a lot of work - I'm a constant tripper, shoe laces untier, sitting on cactus, stabbing myself with my hiking poles, spilling water, doubting Thomas, tired sorta hiker. The real point of this journal entry - Please pray for Gatlinburg, the beautiful Smoky Mountains. - the wildlife, firefighters, emergency teams, citizens, and policemen. RAIN! RAIN! RAIN! Thank you!Peace be with you.","

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552031,Our daughter and her husband bought a new house over the summer and we are headed over to Atlanta to help them finish their basement. Since we are only going to be 2 hours away from Amicalola Falls the wife and I will do the approach trail while there. Can't wait to climb all those stairs.,"

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552482,"""We Came, We Saw, We kicked its Ass""...(from Ghostbusters).. or did that mountain kick ours. Sunday, December 11th - we hiked the approach trail that leads to the BEGINNING of the Appalachian Trial - 7.3 mile one way. It was cold out but it was a wonderful practice hike. Practice is the key word. We need a lot of practice (or I do). Due to a late start we only made it about 5 miles up. It started to rain and we didn't want to take the chance that we didn't get back before dark.The uphills were tiring and the down hills were slippery (with all the wet leaves) and hard on my knees (we both forgot our poles). BUT I know what I need for equipment and what I need more practice on. My husband write his entry - his thoughts will probably be totally different than mine. He is very optimistic. He is ready. He can't wait. Me I'm a little hesitant. My current mantra is ""What could go Right! What could go Right!.
One of my beautiful daughters recently told a co-worker about our plans to hike the trail in the spring...her friends response was ""that's a terrible ideal, do they know people get killed out there"". LOL
SIDE NOTE: A couple of years ago I hid a quarter in a sign on the approach trail. Guess what - it was still there. If any one needs a quarter you can find it. BUT I'm not telling you which sign.
Merry Christmas!
Peace be with You!","

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553286,"Hello,This is Mike here and I have to tell you I am getting tired of think about all the gear. I believe my wife and I are overthinking it so I am done.   What about the rest of you, do you feel the same way? Only thing I know is that I can't wait to be thrown into the fire and get started. Like we all do in our lives we will adapt to our surroundings. We completed a nice 8 mile practice hike on Monday at a state park here in Texas and its was great. We are thinking about changing our start date because my wife hikes better in the cold than the heat, but we will see.",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Sat",0

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554976,"Well still counting days and still thinking about starting earlier. Went out for a 10 mile overnight in Cap Rock Canyon (Texas) and it went pretty well. During the night we heard a pack of coyotes singing 3 or 4 times and it was awesome. As I said we are thinking about starting 8th or 9th of March instead of the 22nd. Wife does better in cooler weather.Just read Giggles TJ and his knees couldn't take the first week and he headed home, which makes me wonder if mine will. My knees are not the best from years of construction work. (cement, flooring, roofing...etc) I guess I will find out soon enough.Called where you sign in for a thur hike at(Amicalola falls) and they said there are 152 already signed in and on the trail. She said the crowd is about to hit.Wish everyone the best","

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555794,"Well we got sick of trying to decide, so we jumped in the truck and drove over to our daughters house in Atlanta (17 Hours) and decide to start the AT March 8 instead of the 22nd, which is tomorrow. Going to drive up and register today. Having read so many TJ of hikers that are out there now it just motivates you more and more. Looks like we got a couple nice days to start but have rain coming in this weekend. Too all the hikers starting on the 22nd that we have talked to you will catch us we are in no hurry. Good luck to all!!","

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556093,"How to describe day 1, it was like the first day of school everyone has new stuff and pictures are taken. Our son-in-law Tim drove us to the parking lot atop springer and hiked out to the begin of the AT (.9 miles) and then back to the parking lot to grab our gear and away we went. We hiked for about 2 hours before we even saw another hiker, then the herd passed us which was fine with us. Day 1 is pretty easy and everyone is in a great mood. We stopped for the night at Hawk Mt campsite, total miles with the beginning overlap was 8.3.Funny story: About a 2 miles into the hike Feather took off her pack and set it on the edge of the trail and the pack fell backwards and rolled down the side of a hill about 25 feet. She was laughing and said she knew it would eventually stop.","Springer Mt

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556095,"When you lay down in your tent for the night you usually plan your next day and where you are going to camp, well things don't always work out. We wanted to make it to Gooch Mt Shelter, but see there was this Mountain named Sassafras that laughed at us and said I don't think so. It is true Sassafras will kick your ass and it did ours and several others. We made it to Justus Creek and camped there for the night. About 2am we got our first powerful thunder and heavy rain display and it pretty much ended any good sleep. We have all our gear in the tent so nothing got wet except tent cover. In the morning several hikers had a lot of wet stuff and were hiking in wet gear so we were lucky.","Hawk Mt Campstie

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556098,"When we weighed our packs at the beginning my weigh was 40 (UGH) and Feather's was 25. My wife (Feather) is 5'6"" and has a small frame, so we were worried about the 25lbs. Our gut said both our packs were to heavy, but we pushed on and like always your gut is right. On day 3 the pack was really starting to slow her down so since this is HYOH (hike your own hike) and some miracle we got one bar of service on our phone we had Tim pick us up at Gooch Gap on Friday night. We will go through our packs and re-evaluate. After being out there 3 days we look at items in the pack and laugh and say why in the hell did I think I needed that. We will be back out there tomorrow hopefully a lot lighter.For everyone that's getting ready to start look at everything and ask yourself if you REALLY need it.Good luck to all","Justus Creek

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556290,"After taking out the steaks, beer and kitchen sink from our backpacks we ran out to where we left off (Gooouch) and did a quick 3.6 miles over to Woody Gap today to see if our adjustments helped. (We then hiked the 3.6 back to Gouch to our ride) Temps were cold at first but turned out great and our adjustments seem to pay dividends. Only saw a few hikers and everyone was talking about getting out of the cold for the next 2-3 days. A ridge runner at Gouch was informing all of the bitter cold nights coming. We will be back on the trail on Friday morning and hope to see everyone out there. Be Safe!!!!","Gooch

Roof & Feather (subject to change),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558549,"Wanted to update this for anyone following us. I (Roof)knew the hardest part of the trail for me would be the mental part and it was. We made it to Hiawassee (DCG) and I was so bored. Anyone reading this is probably like are you crazy how can you be bored, well all you do is hike, eat and hopefully sleep. See I love to work and be busy and the trail is just the opposite. Don't get me wrong the people on the trail are awesome and we were really impress with the younger hikers and their politeness and the respect they showed to us. We met some great couples out there as well and wish everyone success in their own hikes. We are still following several people thur their post and are jealous every time we read them, but the trail will be there for years to come and maybe we can take another crack at it. Feather is ready to go back and start where we left off every time she reads these post. Good Luck to all.","
