Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562738,"Last night was the windiest night ever. I'm really glad it wasn't raining because the wind was blowing the fly straight into the side of the tent. We would have been soaked. But we weren't!
We did have a hard time getting out of bed. We both kept thinking the wind would calm down a bit, but it never did, and like most mornings, having to go to the bathroom drew us out of our tent. We didn't get in the trail until around 10, but we had decided to do a shorter day anyway, so we had about six and a half miles to go. It's tough planning miles based on where you want to stop and resupply. Sometimes it means doing shorter days than you'd like, sometimes you do longer ones. In the Smokies, it's based mostly on where the shelters are. Today we had a choice of 6.5 miles or a little over 12 miles, with nowhere to stop in between. The late start made it easier to choose.
Pretty easy day. Finished listening to the Graveyard Book today. I've been reading and listening to more books than I was anticipating. I've finished reading Cujo, I'm halfway through a book I picked up in a hiker box, and I finished listening to Life of Pi and Graveyard Book. Definitely digging the audio books more than music on easy days. I appreciate Disney soundtracks on days where I really need to get up hills though. 
Today was a first for us. We saw someone quit the trail. Some people we were traveling with have quit, but we always found out via text. Today, a man we just met yesterday told us he was kidding himself if he thought he could make it to Maine, and he started the 11 mile hike back to Fontana Dam. It was weird seeing him go. He started with a group of eight strangers, and they were keeping pace with each other the whole way. One by one they dropped out. He was the last one. You know going into this that 75% of people don't finish, but it's different when you actually start seeing it happen.","Molly Ridge Shelter

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548119,"So this is actually happening!When I told my wife I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail, she looked at me like I was crazy. Rightfully so. A bit of craziness is practically a prerequisite for attempting something like a thru-hike, and I probably have more than the requisite amount of it. Then she asked if I just planned on leaving her alone for five months. That didn't sound good to either of us, but she had never even camped overnight before, never mind doing any long distance hiking!Later that week, I came home to several things: A copy of Appalachian Trials, an Appalachian Trail guidebook, a list of potential dates we could move back to Connecticut to make the trip happen, and my personal favorite, a wife who had her mind set on doing whatever was necessary to be ready to join me on this crazy adventure. Luckiest.Guy.Ever.Since then, we've been saving, and hiking, and going to the gym, and hiking, and lurking on Trail Journals (and WhiteBlaze, the AT subreddit, Appalachian Trials, etc.)...oh ya, and hiking. Are we going to be ready for the trail? Absolutely not. Are we doing it anyway? Damn straight!Look out Katahdin! We're comin' to getcha! (Slowly...but we'll get there. Don't wait up, just leave the light on.)",,View Entry,"Sep 08, Thu",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548194,"The majority of our gear arrived the other day! We can finally start doing our practice hikes with an appropriate amount of weight. I am simultaneously excited and dreading our first outings with all this extra weight. I wouldn't exactly say the training hikes have been easy without it, so we'll see how it goes...First up is Murphy Ranch! It has a stretch that's got 500+ steps, so I figured it would be good practice for our first day of hiking, since we'll be taking the approach trail from Amicalola Falls. Wish us luck!",,Gear Arrival,"Sep 09, Fri",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548261,"Today we decided to do a practice hike at Murphy's Ranch. It's only a 4.25 mile loop, but it features a giant staircase right near the end with 500+ steps. Not quite as much as Amicalola Falls, but we figured it'd be a good introduction at least. I decided to hike it with my pack, tent, sleeping bag and pad, just to start getting used to the weight. My pack was super difficult to adjust though. It was one of those ""But this fit perfectly in the store!"" type of deals. I'll probably go back and see if they can help me with the adjustment, because I just couldn't get the hip belt to fit correctly for the life of me. Other than that, it actually felt pretty good! (Good, of course, being relative, because I actually wanted to die the majority of the time we were going up the stairs). On the bright side, we had done this same hike several months ago, and this time around it was much easier for both of us. It's pretty hard to get a sense of fitness progression with hiking, since each hike is so different. Am I getting stronger, or does this hike happen to be less strenuous? Going back and doing a hike we had done in the past really hammered in that we weren't wasting our time with all the practice hikes, and we really have grown. That felt pretty awesome. (Awesome, of course, being relative, because I still wanted to die the majority of the time we were going up the stairs...)Now we just need to pick up some remaining odds and ends, and next time we go out we can both be fully geared up with what we plan on taking with us to start the hike. It feels more real every day!",,Murphy's Ranch,"Sep 10, Sat",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549436,"I finally finished a practice hike with the full weight of my gear on my back! We did the Bridge to Nowhere, which is about 11 miles round trip. I learned several important lessons today:1. We have wild tarantulas on the trails in California. I did not know that.2. After seeing a wild tarantula, everything that moves out of the corner of your eye is definitely, 150%, also a wild tarantula. Probably hunting you. 3. My hip bones stick out too much. I need to adjust my hip belt so I don't end hikes with welts on my hips.4. I found a way to adjust my bag so apparently my right shoulder and right knee carry all the weight. At least that's what the post-hike soreness in those areas would imply. Must look into that...5. I'm much too white to not bring sunscreen. At least I was this morning. Now I'm much too red to not bring sunscreen.Other than that, good times! A bit dusty and super hot, but what can you do? Afterward we went to a cafe and got fancy burgers and milkshakes, because what's the use in burning calories if you don't plan on replacing them immediately?",,Bridge to Nowhere,"Sep 24, Sat",11
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551303,"We weren't really feeling like driving very far for a hike this week, so we ended up going back to Murphy's Ranch. Lazy? Probably. But at least it was also unoriginal!

Last time I was here, I did a half weight pack for the ""Staircase of Death"" (as all the graffiti on the road kept calling it). This time I decided to go for the full weight. I added a 10 pound weight to simulate the food. Then I tried eating the weight to simulate hiker hunger. I think I'm ready. 

Not only was the staircase a bit easier, but the pack felt WAAAAAAY better. Last time I took it out, it rubbed my hip bones raw, and in my novice ignorance, I assumed I was just a misshapen human being. Luckily, there's an REI near my apartment, so I went in for an expert's opinion. They informed that I am, in fact, a misshapen human being. But they also said that it was ok! I can just wear the hip belt lower than it's supposed to be worn, and that's totally cool! I imagine this will be the first in a long line of mind blowing ""...but that's not how the box said to use it!"" moments for me. 

Overall, a success. I want to do these stairs one more time before we move back east, and I want to be able to do the entire thing without stopping. Then I'll know I'm really ready. You know, other than the whole hiking in the rain for weeks, rock scrambles, months of ramen, fording rivers, losing toenails, getting eaten by bugs, not showering, twisted ankles and overwhelming humidity. But how hard could that be?",,Back to Murphy's!,"Nov 08, Tue",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551418,"Rebecca and I took our full weight packs out camping this weekend! We stayed at the West Fork Trail Campground. It's about a 5.3 mile hike to the site (a lot of downhill) then 5.3 back (a lot of wishing for the power of teleportation). 
We weren't anticipating how early it gets dark in the woods. We showed up to camp around 4, and by 5 it was pitch black. Campfires also aren't allowed right now, and I think those accounted for about 99% of all post-dusk entertainment on my previous camping trips. Especially when bugs are around, as we account for 99% of their post-dusk entertainment too. And food. 
We stumbled across a ladybug meeting ground on the way to camp! There were thousands of them just lying around on rocks and fallen trees. I'm not sure what the occasion was. My guess was a ladybug orgy, but when I asked one of them, being a lady, she refused to either confirm or deny. 
This outing was our first attempt at bear bagging. It went...well...as one would expect a first attempt to go, I guess. I did the thing. It wasn't pretty. And it certainly wasn't quick. We didn't get eaten though, and I'll consider that a success. How do people keep their rope from getting tangled from one day to the next? Mine is already a mess.
This outing was also our first time setting up our tent outside, or sleeping on our sleeping pads and in our bags. The tent set-up went pretty well, other than figuring out where all the stakes go. We're pretty sure it came with extras, just not sure how many. Not that the stakes even wanted to go into the ground. I thought New England was bad with the rockiness, but this dirt was impossible to find a spot to put a stake. It was either pushing straight into a rock, or pushing into sand and it pulled itself out a second later. California is dry. Fun fact. Bet ya'll didn't know that. But ya, the dirt here is not moist. 
The sleeping went pretty poorly. Not uncomfortable, just a lot of fidgeting, and for those of you who have slept on Thermarests, you know they're not the quietest while fidgeting. Rebecca and I will either need to learn to sleep without moving a ton, or learn to turn that crinkling into white noise we can both ignore, otherwise sleep is only going to happen in times of exhaustion - which luckily(?) we'll have a lot of, I'm sure! 
My knee was acting up a lot on this hike. I'm a little worried now. I'm going to get it checked out. There were times I hardly felt it, but others where I couldn't even hobble. Rough times. Also, my shoulders are killing me from all the weight I put on my trekking poles as a result of my knee being weak. But maybe I'll have jacked shoulders soon. That'd be nice.",,West Fork Trail Camping,"Nov 13, Sun",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552396,"I haven't updated in a while, and that's mostly because...I haven't done any practice hikes in a while. After my last entry, I decided seeing a doctor about my knee while I still have insurance would probably be a good plan. Turns out, I was right! They took a look and referred me to physical therapy immediately.The physical therapist had me walk the treadmill, took some videos, had me bring in my full pack so she could see how I walk with the weight, and a bunch of other interesting exercises. Turns out my knee pain is most likely because my glutes aren't super fit (or in technical terms, my ass is weak). Well...that's a bit of an understatement. Apparently without realizing it, I've spent my whole life using muscles other than my glutes at every opportunity. My doctor had me do a bunch of exercises that work glutes AND another muscle, and in every exercise the other muscle was doing all the work. She actually seemed pretty skeptical after doing all the exercises and saying I felt nothing in my glutes, so she got out the electrodes that measure when a muscle activates. She put one on my glute and one on whatever other muscle the exercise was supposed to work, and we looked at the readout. If the line for my glutes were a heart-rate monitor, let's just say they'd be running for the defibrillators.This is pretty important for me to get, because apparently I lean back when I walk downhill, which puts extra stress on glutes and knees...which in my case means just my knees. My PT wants me to try leaning forward a bit more and sinking into the hill as I go downhill, which should put extra weight on my glutes and hamstrings...which right now equals just my hamstrings, which I'm sure would burn them out pretty quickly if I make that switch before learning how to activate my glutes. For the past few weeks I've been doing a bunch of exercises and trying to learn what it even feels like to activate my glutes, so I can do that more when I hike. All the doctors say that by April, this shouldn't be a problem at all, so this definitely won't impact the hike, and I'll be back to practice hikes as soon as we get back to CT. More updates will come then!",,An update,"Dec 12, Mon",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555722,"We fly out to Georgia on April 4th and start our journey on April 5th. It's crazy that it's so close! We've been getting all our gear in order and practicing all the essentials (knots, bear bagging, setting up the tent, packing, etc). Unfortunately, we also got a crazy amount of snow this year, so we haven't gotten to practice the other essential (you know...the whole ""hiking"" part) as much as I'd like. We've been doing a lot of stair climbing though, so we'll at least be a bit more ready for Day 1 at Amicalola. Well, as much as anyone can really be ready for 600+ stairs. 

I also decided I'll be taking a small Teemo figurine with me on the trail. Every day I'll be taking a picture with Teemo in it. Starting out, they'll be very obvious, but over time I'm going to start hiding him and letting people try to find him. I hope everyone enjoys the hunt as much as I'm going to enjoy the hike!

I'll be updating tomorrow with a gear post and final base weights for all you number nerds out there (like me).",,Less than a month!,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556584,"As promised (and only ten days later than promised) here is my gear! I won't be going over the weights of each specific item, just the overall weight at the end. 
The Big Three (but really four)

Pack - Osprey Atmos 50 AG - Small (I took the brain off to shave a little extra weight. Wasn't really using it anyway)
Tent - Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 2 (It's cozy with both of us in there, but we've got some living space. I'm sure the available ""living space"" will seem much smaller for both of us after a few months...) 
Sleeping Bag - Kelty Cosmic 20 Degree Down Bag
Ground Pad - Thermarest NeoAir XLite (Super comfy, but man this thing crinkles when you move around. It's like sleeping on bubble wrap. I feel bad for those sleeping nearby.)


Hiking Gear

ExOfficio Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs - (I chafe in...places... These things are like a cloud hugging my bottom at all times.)
Royal Robbins Zip N' Go Convertible Pants - (I used to love zip-off pants growing up. Everyone said they were uncool. We'll see who's laughing when the weather warms up and I'm all like ""Zip, zip! Cool as a cucumber!"")
Icebreaker Tech T Lite Short Sleeve T-Shirt - (So soft. So warm.)
Chaos Summit Pack-It Hat - (This makes me look like a super white tourist. But that's exactly what I am. It also protects my super white, hella Irish skin from the unforgiving sun, so I'll have to deal.)
Vasque Mindbender Trail-Running Shoes - (I have bad ankles, but still opted for Trail Runners out of sheer convenience and comfort. We'll see how I do over time)
Injinji Sport Mini Crew Toesocks - (I've never even come close to getting blisters on any training hikes. These little guys are magic)
Darn Tough Micro Crew Cushion Hiking Socks - (These guys help too)
Superfeet Green Heritage Insoles - (Honestly, I don't feel a difference between my boot's original insoles and these, but I'm assuming the benefit will be felt long-term)
Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Z Z-Poles - (I'm glad I used these before actually heading onto the trail. My first time using them killed my shoulders. Also I used them very wrong.)


Camp Clothes

People Socks Merino Wool - (Different type of sock. A bit heavier and warmer, but I'd still hike in these if I ever needed. In fact I'm probably taking an extra pair to do exactly that)
Icebreaker Oasis Long Sleeve Crewe Top - (This was the shirt I was originally going to hike in, but it runs a little hot in the summer and already has a hole in it, so it has become my warm sleeping shirt)
Minus33 Merino Wool Acadian Lightweight Boxer Briefs - (These boxers are also great at preventing chafing, but just slightly less comfortable while doing so. Relegated to sleeping undies)
Duofold Men's Midweight Wicking Thermal Pants - (These will probably get sent home when summer comes around, but I get cold really easily)
Adidas Performance Voloomix GR Athletic Sandal - (Soooo light and comfy!)


Conditional Weather Gear

Outter Layer - Wantdo Hooded Packable Lighweight Short Quilted Jacket - (This stuffs into that tiny sack in the picture and is puffy and warm)
Mid Layer - Arcteryx Fortez Hoody - (Warmest hoody I've ever worn. Also doesn't have a hood. Have I been wrong my whole life about what a hoody is?!)
Rain Shell - Frogg Toggs Ultra Lite Rain Suit - (These will undoubtedly break pretty early on, but they're super light and SUPER cheap and available at any Wal-Mart in the world)
Gloves - Cannondale 3 Season Gloves - (These suck, but I've only tested them in Winter, which is the one season they're not meant to work in. Still, we'll see if I end up keeping these)
Winter Hat - Minus33 Merino Wool Ridge Cuff Beanie - (This is the exact opposite of the gloves. This doesn't suck at all. It's the best. Anti-suck, if you will)
Pack Cover - Osprey UltraLight Raincover - (It...it covers the pack. Not sure what other info I can give about this. It covers real good)


Electronics

Phone - Nexus 5X - (Primarily for pictures and keeping this journal updated while I'm on the trail)
Headlamp - Black Diamond Storm Headlamp - (Primarily for seeing in the dark. It's like a super power, but available to everyone at a reasonable price)
mp3 Player - Kubik Evo 8 GB with 64 GB SD Card - (I wasn't going to bring an mp3 player originally, but I know there will be times when I want mood music, and I have about 64 gigs worth of movie soundtracks that I think will make epic moments even more epic)
Backup Battery - Jackery Titan S Qualcomm - (Holds like 9 extra charges. It's probably excessive. Definitely excessive. But I like.)
Also charging cords and earbuds


Toiletries

Sunscreen/Chafe Protection - Dynarex Zinc Oxide
Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel - (Prescribed for my knee)
Baby Wipes/Toothbrush/Toothpaste/Floss
Dr Bronners Scent Free Soap
Tentlab Duece of Spades Trowel


Miscellaneous

Ultra Flex Athletics Knee Compression Sleeve - (Hopefully this will help my knee hold out)
Victorinox Swiss Army Climber II Pocket Knife - (Now if I see a bear, I can open a bottle for it and we can chill and be bros)
Sawyer Squeeze (with SP150 Coupling so you can backwash with your water bottle)
Light My Fire Tritan Spork - (Honestly, this is another item I'm pretty sure I'll send home and replace at some point. I haven't had any problems with it yet...I just have a feeling. Why is the knife part of the fork? That's asking for an accident. And why did I buy a fork that has a knife on the back of it? All good questions.)
HangTight Wiregate Carabiner - (Bear bagging Part 1)
Nite Ize Reflective Nylon Cord (50 feet) - (Bear bagging Part Deux)
Outdoor Products 3-pack Ultimate Dry Sacks
Bandana
Teemo Statue - (This is the guy I'll be taking pictures with every day. He's cute. And evil. But cute.)


Aaaaand, that's about it! Since I'm carrying the whole tent, Rebecca is carrying the stove (MSR PocketRocket), the pot (MSR Titan Tea Kettle), and the first aid kit. 
Altogether, it weighs in at 19.5 lbs. I was shooting for under 20 base weight, and it looks like I just made it! There should be about another 10-12 lbs of food/water when we start, so we'll be running at sub 35 to start. I'm sure we'll send home a lot of gear as we see what we end up using the most, but this is what we've got for now!",,The Gear!,"Mar 16, Thu",0
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557418,"Following the advice of countless others who came before me, I've written a list of reasons I want to hike the Appalachian Trail. I'll be bringing it with me so in my darkest hour, I can read it and remind myself why I'm out there in the first place. 

To show myself what I'm capable of
To gain a new perspective on life
To finish something I set my mind to
To fulfill a lifelong dream
To see how I respond when pushed harder than I've ever been pushed before
To become stronger than the voice in my head
To have the adventure of a lifetime
To strengthen my relationship
To live without so much technology in my life (and yes, the irony of having to update this via my cellphone is not lost on me)
To become part of the wonderful AT community
To start this new chapter of my life off with a bang
To live without regrets
To share this part of myself with Rebecca
To make new friends
To be someone my (future) kids can look up to
To learn to appreciate the little things in life
To see more of the country I've lived in my whole life
For the stories!
To inspire those close to me to follow their dreams
To see more starts than I've ever seen
To learn to rely on people
For the best honeymoon pictures ever
To validate all my years learning wilderness survival
To get in the best shape of my life
To be reminded that no matter what happens, there's still unimaginable beauty in the world
Because I can (and that won't always be true)

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558087,"I've been going back and forth between hiking to support a specific cause. On the one hand, obviously I'd want to take any opportunity to support a cause I feel passionate about. How could that be a bad thing, right? On the other hand, suddenly the success of my hike has very real ramifications on a charity I feel passionate about! If people donate for every mile I hike, and I drop out early for whatever reason, I've just cost that charity a decent amount of money (and yes, I know they're still getting more than they would otherwise, but that wouldn't make me feel less guilty). Am I really ready to have that type of responsibility on top of everything else I'll be dealing with?Ultimately, I've decided to do it anyway. It's one more reason I can add to my list for being here, and it's something else I can think about any time I'm thinking about quitting. This hike is a very personal thing, and I think every thru-hike has to be a bit selfish, but I don't think that means it has to be exclusively personal or selfish. I think there's a lot of opportunity to serve yourself while serving others, and if my hike can make a difference for even one other person, I'll be happy.I've decided to hike to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. I chose this charity because they're dedicated to stepping in and helping wounded veterans in places where the government is currently failing them. They provide mental health services, physical health services and career counseling, and provide a space where veterans can connect with each other and their communities.

On the bright side, it means we'll have a better chance of making it past Springer mountain tomorrow so we don't have to camp on the top of a mountain during a thunderstorm.On the way up the mountain a little kid sprinted past me and excitedly said ""I just came from back there! Now I'm going all the way up there!"" ""Me too! Well, that's the plan at least."" The kids looked at me doubtfully, no doubt noticing the shaking legs and sweat dropping off of me.

I just need to walk uncomfortably slow. Then slow down a bit more. I definitely think I'll be able to make it, just not as fast as is like to go downhill. Ah well. I'll take it.Today we're tenting on a road that just drops off down a cliff right outside the tent. Not ideal, but it was the only spot left.

This is the third tallest mountain in Georgia and the tallest mountain in the Georgia section of the AT. It's the first real physical challenge we've faced. The uphill was actually not bad, but the two and a half mile downhill destroyed my knees. Real bad. But I made it!Onto the second challenge... The mental. After you get to the bottom of Blood Mountain, you get to Neels Gap, where you can rent cabins with showers, get pizza, sleep in a comfortable bed, etc. You can also grab a hitch off the trail at this point, so after experiencing the pleasures of civilization, many people decide they don't want to go back to the squalor if the trail. They all throw their shoes into the tree at the outfitter. There are a lot of shoes in that tree. We return to the trail tomorrow though! Also, the entire hiking group from day 1 had stuck together! We're sharing two cabins tonight.

We had to make it to Unicoi by 11 am to catch a shuttle into Hiawasee for our resupply. We had five miles to go (including a brutal up and downhill) and only three and a half hours to do it, so we had to rush a bit.I don't mind uphills, but Blue Mountain had a lot of false summits that start to get to you. The downhill though... That was a definite low point for me. My knees hurt so much I could barely even hobble down the hill. I honestly can't even remember the last time I've been in this much pain. Everyone was passing me, asking me if I was ok, and honestly, I wasn't. It hurt so much. We finally made it to the bottom and I just kind of collapsed. The shuttle took us into town and when walking to food, I couldn't bend my left knee at all. I saw a bunch of people I had been hiking with and let them know I'd see them on the trail tomorrow and they all looked at me limping and gave a sympathetic ""Why don't you take a day?"" That didn't help. When we got to the room I soaked my knee, then we got a new brace at the pharmacy and walked around town a bit. It was MUCH better after that!

And it's super lucky I forgot it at a town with two easy points of entry so I didn't have to backtrack at all! After the pain of Blue Mountain, the new brace has been working out great. We had a 2.5 mile downhill section yesterday where EVERYONE'S knees were bothering them by the end, and mine still felt good. Definitely happy with the purchase. We spent last night at Top of Georgia hostel. We didn't really need the laundry or shower services, having just recently spent the night in town, but we had heard so much about it, we really wanted to check it out. This place definitely lived up to the hype. It's a hostel for hikers, by hikers. It's the Riot Games of hostels. You show up and they immediately give you a free soda and offer you cotton scrubs so you can change out of your hiking clothes and do laundry. The place is beautiful, with trail facts and pictures all over the walls, there's several communal areas to hang out, free coffee and tea, and hot dogs, pizza and ice cream for purchase. They also have a small gear shop with a lot of hiking staples (a zip lock bag with a full roll of toilet paper with the tube already taken out! Score!) The owner was pretty awesome too. Sir Packs A Lot was his name, and it's clear he loves what he does. During the morning AYCE cereal feast (included in the $25 price to stay the night) he have a speech with tons of helpful tips and fun tidbits. Apparently by mile 273, 50% of hikers have quit the trail. Fun fact. There was also someone feeling sick who wanted to spend the night, but to avoid them infecting others, he offered to pay for him to spend the night at a motel in town, and drove him down there himself. Guy was a class act. Definitely stay here if you get the chance.We met a hiker here who looked to be in his late 30's, who worked in Saudi Arabia in his twenties making a decent amount of money, and apparently the first 100k a year you make there isn't taxed by the US as income, so he lived in 25k a year and saved the rest. When the financial crisis hit, he invested all his savings into banks when they were at their lowest. Now, he makes enough off those investments to spend the rest of his life doing long trails and traveling to hike in other countries. Probably goes without saying, but he was one of the most content people I've ever met.Today we're getting a late start (since I had to get my phone) but we're hoping to make it the 9 miles to the GA/NC border.

We're already low on fuel because of this. When you're sleeping, it sounds like you're on the shore of a stormy beach with angry waves pounding against the sand every few seconds. Some of the wind waves will hit the tent dead on and shake it as vigorously as if someone were outside physically shaking it. It's even worse when it's raining, as the wind blows the rain fly straight into the tent no matter how far you stake it out, which shakes the water straight through the tent. When you're walking, it's physically blowing your legs every time you pick them up, almost blowing you off the path. You have to constantly dig your poles into the ground to keep from tripping. It made a twelve mile day today seem much longer...

Gatlinburg is crazy. There's a Paula Deen store right next to the Mellow Mushroom, right next to Daiquiri Dude. There's also eight old time photo shops. Eight! On less than a one mile strip!
We stopped by the aquarium yesterday. It was pretty awesome. I got to pet some aquatic majestic flap flaps, I got to see penguins up close, and I got to walk through a tunnel and see sharks swimming all around me. It was neat.
Other than that, I officially resupplied for the next four hiking days. I bought 20 McDoubles. Hiker power food. Tons of calories, carbs and protein, and enough preservatives to easily last all week. This should be a great week. Or awful. Only time will tell...","Gatlinburg

Our shuttle was supposed to leave at 7:30, but the road closed again due to snow and ice, so we had to wait until 10:30. I hadn't thought about it, but they can't use sand or ice to melt the snow, as the run off could hurt the plants next to the road. Kind of a unique problem for a national park.
We were greeted by the remnants of the snow when we started hiking. A bit slippery and very cold. The going was slow, especially after a three day break. It was very pretty though. I think we've now officially experienced all four seasons in the Smokies alone.
By the afternoon, the sun had come out. That helped with the cold, but made the snow drop from the trees in huge clumps. There were a few that caught me completely by surprise and drenched me. I put my rain gear on pretty fast. 
We passed Charlie's Bunyon today. The view was absolutely amazing. Definitely worth the hike. All day had great views, really. The trees, mixed with the snowfall, mixed with the downed trees from the storm... It all just really came together.
Day one of the McDouble challenge is complete. They taste fine when they're cool... They don't taste great when frozen, and the weather today froze them. Still finished three. Didn't have any for lunch though. Hoping it warms up a bit tomorrow. Speaking of lunch, I met a guy who was hiking during the storm and he showed me a video he took of a tree being uprooted by the wind. The roots were on the trail, so the whole trail raised up a foot when the tree fell. It was crazy. It made me really happy we stopped when we did...","Newfound Gap

I was betting on no horses coming by last night... It paid off! It was the last flat spot and we didn't have to move for any horses. I also haven't seen a single horse yet. I have no idea how they'd do some of these trails.
We had a long day today. The weather was great for it! Unfortunately, great weather following snow meant a ton of melting snow, which meant deep deep mud all day. My feet and boots got soaked. Some great views to make up for it though.
Last half of the day was all downhill. My knee was acting up yesterday, so I broke out the big brace today. It helped, but my knees were still aching. Tomorrow is almost ALL downhill, so I'm a little nervous, but I'll make do. Slowly but surely.
I have to say, while the Smokies are beautiful, their beauty comes at a higher price than anywhere we've hiked yet. Looking forward to leaving them tomorrow.
The McDouble challenge: Day 2. It still sucks to have frozen McDoubles, so I tried to heat one up in the pot this morning. Didn't work great. The bread warmed up (but also stuck to the pan) and the meat stayed cold. At lunch I added a little water to try and steam heat one, and put another on the roof of the shelter in the sun. The steam didn't work, but the roof actually did! I also traded a McDouble for a vastly superior lasagna meal, which I ate for dinner tonight along with another McDouble. 13 left.
Holy Smokes accidentally left $100 worth of weed at a shelter 7 miles back, so today he hiked seven miles there, seven miles back, and then did the 13 miles we did today. I can't even imagine...","Peck's Corner

Today was all downhill. I went super slow, but I wasn't in pain, so I'll take it. There were a few good views, but mostly there was just a lot of evidence of the destruction of the last storm (which was a cool view in its own way) There were threatening clouds, but they held off and we had sunshine escorting us out of the park.
We did a pretty light day so we could check out the Standing Bear Hostel. This place is pretty cool. They had the option of tenting, staying in a bunkhouse, getting a private room by the stream, or getting a private room IN A TREEHOUSE!!! Call me Tarzan, because I'm sleeping in the trees tonight! 
A bunch of people chilled here during the day and continued on. Sody, Levi (who's hiking in jeans and a cotton t-shirt), Great Lakes and King Cakes are spending the night. This place has a bunch of books, three cute dogs who fetch, shower, laundry (though you have to do it yourself on a washboard), and a resupply shed. 
The resupply shed is very unique here. Everyone gets a tab card and writes down everything they take. When they leave, you pay for everything at once. It's entirely on an honor system. It's great to see a system like that work and not be abused. 
McDouble Challenge: Day Three. I couldn't do another frozen McDouble for breakfast. I had some of Rebecca's donuts instead. When we got to the hostel I microwaved two for lunch and two for dinner though. Hot McDoubles were better than I could have imagined.","Cosby Knob

When we got there, some trail magic had just set up! They had some McDonald's (that made me chuckle), fresh produce, candy bars, espresso brownies, cold chocolate milk and water, pie, and lots of other stuff. It was put on by the Women Hikers and Outdoor Adventurers (W.H.O.A.)
We met a guy there named Soup who's working on his triple crown. He told us it's bad luck to have an unnamed pack. I decided my pack should be named Weasley, because of its orange straps and the fact that it's just slightly too big and doesn't fit quite right.
The hike today was mostly up, which was awesome. I was definitely tired of downhill. My knees felt great. I finished listening to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and started the second one today. It was also beautiful weather all day. Good stuff.
The shelter was totally empty when we got there. Very odd after the Smokies where they were always full. We also had a hiker come in with a dog! I forgot to mention, but dogs aren't allowed in the Smokies. I'm so pumped that we'll get to see trail dogs again! This one was adorable.

Mostly uphill morning with a downhill evening. Something for everyone! Right before the big uphill, someone left a cooler of trail magic with little bottles of soda. I downed a Mountain Dew and got all the energy I needed for the climb! 
The climb was worth it. Man oh man was it worth it. Max Patch is the most beautiful thing I've seen yet. I kept taking pictures and deleting them because I just couldn't get one that captured the beauty of this place. (I still don't have a good one, but I gave up trying) It's straight out of Sound of Music and the weather was absolutely beautiful all day, so we got full views in every direction. We are lunch up there and took in the view. 
We actually saw a lot of thru hikers make it to the top then continue on without stopping. I know we're going slow and we'll probably have to flip flop and miss the big Katadhin moment because of it, but I have no problem trading that one moment for all the extra great moments we're getting along the trail by taking our time. I can't imagine doing all this and just skipping by things like Max Patch. I hope we don't ever get so fixated on the miles that we don't have time to enjoy this.
McDouble today: I'm down to my last McDouble! They taste much better thawed out and I'm enjoying them much more now. I'll admit, I'm getting to the tail end where I'm feeling safe eating them, but they still smell good...
Teemo update: I'm sorry to report that I've lost Teemo. When we got to the shelter today, we noticed he wasn't on my bag anymore. I'm actually super bummed about that. I don't know where he fell off.

Today's hike was pretty chill. It was a short 10 mile day, and even with an hour lunch, it only took us about five hours. The terrain was nice for most of the day and I just zoned out. 
It was supposed to start raining at noon today. We got to the camp around 2:30, set up the tent, and it immediately started raining after we finished. Mother Nature was awful polite today. Probably because we're out of the Smokies now. 
No official word about Teemo yet, though someone messaged me on Reddit and offered to buy me another Teemo if I needed. It was super generous of them, and if you're reading this by any chance, thanks so much for the offer! I think I'll end up making a cutout of him out of cardboard or something and using that. It'll probably be a few days until I can get it done though, so bear with me.

We got there just as Smokes and the gang (or the NoBo hobos, as they're now being called) were leaving. We ate some good food, dressed in comfortable clothes, since the hostel gives you clothes to wear to town if you want to do laundry while you're there, and did our resupply. 
Unfortunately, my socks were delivered, but to the post office, not the hostel. And the post office was open from 9-10:30, then closed on Sunday. I had to call REI and have them send new socks to Erwin, TN so I can pick them up in a week. Another week without my toe socks... Not super happy, but I'll deal.
At night we did some karaoke with the other hikers. That was a fun time. The hostel owner gave us a bottle of Fireball, so that helped everyone get into a singing mood. Rebecca and I introduced them all to Crazy Ex Girlfriend.

Then it continued up. And up. And up. Then down a bit, followed by more up. Rarely have I been so exhausted. Nothing too steep though, so that was good! We did end up stopping a bit shorter than we expected, but as a result we got an entire campground to ourselves. Worth.","Laughing Heart Hostel

Today was another pretty uphill day, and we had aspirations of a 14 mile day (technically our biggest yet). We got another late start, but figured we could still make it by 6:30.
Right after we started, we passed a man selling drinks out of the back of his truck. It was on the honor system, so you took what you wanted, then he gave you his address to mail him the money later. Haven't seen anything like that before...
After that, we passed a spray painted sign (painted on vinyl house siding) that said ""Mom's Store 100 ft. We weren't sure what they sold there, or if the name of the place was ""Mom's store"" or if a child just made that sign. We decided to check it out.
Super glad we did! It was a run down shack with half of it filled with broken down trash and furniture, but the other half had soda, Yoohoo, ice cream and other snacks. We each got an ice cream and a soda and scarfed them down before hitting the trail.
We ended the day at a cute site right near some water. The bugs were terrible, but we turned our tent fly into a little bug free for and stayed there while we ate.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564880,"Yesterday wasn't great sleep. I didn't get to sleep fast enough, which meant I heard the mice doing their work. Let me explain...
There's a trail rule: During the day, your packs belong to you. During the night, they belong to the mice. They like to explore pockets and make sure there's nothing edible they can steal. You can leave your pockets open and let them rummage, or you can zip your pockets and force them to chew through your pack to get inside. Either way, they're getting in. Hearing them do it always keeps me up though. Last night they were particularly active. They kept climbing on our tent and jumping off onto our packs, then climbing again like some sort of mouse gymnastics.
Today was our longest day yet. My feet felt it. By the end I was really dragging. Luckily there was a hostel at the end for us to chill at. It's a brand new one called Laurel Hostel. Not great. We tented. Finding a spot on the ground without glass was impossible. He had two dogs, one tiny one that growled and barked at us nonstop and one beautiful golden retriever that was friendly. The owner made us some pizzas in the grill though, so that was awesome. $3 pizzas. I'll take it. We also got some Powerade and ice cream. Everything was pretty cheap. Though he was also a bit racist, so... Can't recommend in terms of quality, but the location is perfect for the end of long days.
We met someone who's going into Erwin tomorrow after eight miles, so we're tagging along, we'll spend a day in Erwin, and we'll catch up with our ride on Friday. We're going to see guardians of the Galaxy 2. I'm pretty excited!","Jones meadow

We were hiking up near the top of a mountain and there was a drop-off to one side and some trees on the other. All of a sudden, a deer (or a doe, technically) came sprinting right at me from down the trail. It came straight at me until it was directly in front of me, then cut into the woods.
I totally get the deer in headlights thing now, except in this situation I was the deer and the deer was the headlight. Scared the crap out of me!
Anywho, I actually slept pretty well last night, but since we're zeroing tomorrow, I may write an entire entry about the hostel we stayed at. It was kind of surreal.
Today we're only going 8 miles and change then getting a ride into Erwin. Only two climbs today, so it'll probably be a quick day.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565114,"This will be an as-close-as-i-can-recall telling of our stay at the hostel. It's long. Feel free to skip this if you're not interested.
Getting off the trail, I saw a handwritten sign saying Laurel Hostel .5 miles with an arrow. I was pumped to be done for the day, so I headed down the road. Another sign with another arrow. I passed a shell of what looked like a barn. I prayed the hostel wasn't there. It wasn't. Phew. Then I got to a sign saying I made it to the hostel and if I didn't see anyone, to wait. I didn't see anyone.
I looked at the hostel (which was a combination of a camper with six bunks in it and a small room with another six bunks and a patio area with a table for hanging out). I started towards the table to take a seat when a tiny dog ran at me barking and baring it's teeth aggressively. It stood in front of the patio and I definitely got the feeling it would bite me if I tried to go past it. I backed up to where the sign was and sat on the grass. He seemed ok with that.
Rebecca caught up and wanted to try for the patio as well. She got a similar reception from the dog, so we both stayed under the tree. Eventually another dog came down. It was a gorgeous golden retriever who was much friendlier. He kept us company for a little bit. Finally a guy comes out of a trailer and walks down to us. He doesn't do anything. After some uncomfortable seconds:
""Do you work here?""""Yup."" (more silence)""We were looking to tent here.""""Ok"" (more silence)""Soo... Do you have cold drinks or anything for sale?""""Yep"" (more silence) ""Over here""
Then he walked to the patio. I was a little nervous to follow because of the dog, but he seemed to calm down with the owner nearby. He brought us inside and opened a fridge where they had beer, some soda and powerade. Then he offered us some pizza. $3 pizzas! He cooked them for us on his grill, which was pretty awesome. 
He also showed us a trout pond he had made. It was pretty neat. It was fed straight from a freshwater spring. There was no food in there for them, so he had to feed them dog food a few times a day.
Then another guest showed up. He was from southern Texas. He had a easy time talking to the hostel owner. They talked about guns and fishing...
(HO=Hostel Owner | TM =Texas Man)(On the subject of safe gun practices)HO: Some people just act like idiots with guns.Us: Ya, we actually heard about a guy whipping his gun out while drunk to show a group of drunk people at a hostelHO: Oh, well that's no big deal. My friends and I get drunk all the time and go shooting.
(On the subject of the Super8 we were planning on staying at)HO: I'm not generally racist or anything, but I can't stand them sand n*****s. They run all of those.TM: It's just like gas stations. You can't go into one without seeing a Patel. 
(On the subject of fishing)TM: Check out all the tuna I caught on my last trip.HO: There's a lot of meat on there. That'd sell for a lot to them Chinese for sushi.TM: I think you mean Japanese.HO: That's basically the same, right?TM: Pretty much, ya.
At several points, TM blamed the state of something in America on Millennials and then on the bleeding heart liberals. It definitely seemed like alone, both of them would have been able to keep it inside, but with someone else to feed the racism, they just kind of let loose. 
Now, neither Rebecca or myself are the type to just sit there if someone is talking like that... but we were in a small town where everyone seemed to know each other, everyone owned guns, everyone seemed to share these opinions, and we were going to be sleeping in their lawn for the night. I was honestly a little scared of what would happen if we spoke up. 
Needless to say we turned in early that night. We wanted to get away from the table as fast as possible, so we went to set up our tent. It took a while to find a spot without broken glass on the ground. There was a lot of it... 
After a little bit, some of the hostel owner's friends showed up and we heard them all drinking together at the table. I'd be lying if I said we weren't both a little nervous. 
Eventually we fell asleep. In the morning, the owner came to the tent and offered to make us some coffee. We passed. After we packed up, we couldn't find the owner. While we waited to pay him, more hikers showed up. The little dog ran up to every single one of them barking and snarling. After about four more hikers showed up, the owner finally emerged from his trailer to welcome them. 
His dog only barked when new people showed up. I'm not sure why he always waited so long before coming out. We paid and got on our way, every dog in the neighborhood barking at us on the way out. Weird trip...","

She was feeling homesick in Hot Springs, but we agreed not to leave during moments like that, so she stuck it out until Erwin (which was about four days of beautiful weather, some great views, and some hiking that wasn't too rough). After that time, she still just wasn't enjoying the hike anymore.
I couldn't be prouder of her. She didn't go into this hike as a longtime hiker or camper. She had done one overnight camping trip, and only a handful of hikes. Still, she managed to get further than over 50% of people who start this trip (Hot Springs is the estimated 50% dropout point). She ended every day exhausted and in pain, and kept going for a month and a half. 
I'll miss her like crazy, but she's making the right decision and I support it entirely. She'll still drive down to join me for some sections, so it's not the end of her journey, just her thru hike.

We quickly found our old crew, so Jeff (Count Smooth), Jude, Erika (Lightweight) and I got to hang out. That was pretty awesome. Jeff is getting off the trail for a few days for his daughter's birthday, so I might even be able to catch up to him!
I got to meet Teradactyl at Trail Days! I followed his journal from beginning to end last year. A lot of my gear and trail habits were a direct result of his journal. He gave me his card and told me to hit him up when I get to New Hampshire.
We all stopped by the thrift store to pick up some clothes for the hiker parade (all the hikers from this and previous years hike down main Street and the locals spray you with water guns and hoses). I got a beautiful dress for the occasion. It rained though, so the spraying wasn't exactly necessary... The only bad side was that I forgot sunscreen. Now I have a dress shaped sunburn. Sexy? Yes. Painful? Oh yeah. Excruciating when wearing a backpack? OMIGODOWOWOW!!!
After the parade, the library let a bunch of soaked hikers into the library to get out of the rain. They put on Monty Python and the Holy Grail on a projector, passed out free sodas, and made us all popcorn. Honestly, everyone in Damascus was just so friendly! 
When we got back to camp, the parties started. There was a drum circle, a huge fire ring, and a forest full of party camps. I debated taking pictures, but there was just too much craziness to capture. Definitely a good time though.
Getting out of Damascus at the end was a bit harder... The shuttles filled up super fast and no one was stopping to pick us up after we made a sign to hitch. After a few hours, someone finally stopped and took us to the airport so we could rent a car for Rebecca to get back to CT. Huge thanks to Michael! You really saved the day.

We got to go to REI and go shopping in Asheville! We returned our leaky tent and got the new model. It has no seam on the floor, so already a good sign. A lady there helped me adjust my pack more comfortably too, though it hurt like crazy because of the stupid sunburn. Rebecca also got some sweet new shades. Good trip!

I hit the trail at around 2. I was only looking to go to the first shelter, which was 7.6 miles in, so a light day to start out. (I actually thought it was 5 miles in because I misread the map, so it was actually a longer day than I was expecting...) I have today listed as more mileage because I realized I messed up somewhere and the total was wrong. Just getting it back up to the actual mile marker.
My feet started out painfully. I was expecting as much. Then they stayed that way. For 7.6 miles. That was unexpected. It's either the fact that I've been off the trail for four days, am breaking in new shoes, or am carrying more weight than I'm used to (with a heavier tent, the guidebook, and all the cooking stuff that Rebecca used to carry) or realistically a combination of all three. I'll need to go through my pack and do some cleaning. Some weight needs to go! I'll give the shoes a week, then I may get different ones. 
Beautiful hike to jump back in though! Lots of meadows and gentle slopes. It even decided not to rain, which gave me time to learn how this new tent works. It's huge! Way bigger than the last one. Lots of vestibule room and a high ceiling. Can't wait for Rebecca to see it!

Bean and his crew were thinking of doing the 17 miles into Johnny's, but after yesterday's pain, I was thinking of doing the eleven miles to the next shelter and calling it a day. I got out of camp around 9.
It rained all day, but it was warm, so I just left my frog tog shirt off and let it happen. Today had three tiny uphills of a combined two miles. The rest was downhill. I ended up getting to the shelter by 1. My feet were feeling great (either due to the shoes breaking in, or lightening my load by eating, or remembering to take Ibuprofen today, or a combination of all of them) so I decided to push on. 
Now... If I had known I was doing 17 miles, mostly downhill, I would have worn my big knee brace. Unfortunately, I didn't. By the latter half of the final six mile stretch, my knee decided it was done hiking for the day. I coaxed it for a bit, but it wasn't having it. I slowed to a crawl and it seemed ok with that. 
I got to the hostel in time for a shuttle into town for food. Delicious pasta with generous portions and great prices. I wish I could remember the name of the place. It was amazing. 
I also paid for a slack pack for tomorrow. That's where you leave your pack at the hostel and bring a smaller bag with food and water for the day and they drive you somewhere down the trail and you hike back to the hostel. It's a good way to get more miles and you get another night at the hostel. Win/win. I'm going to attempt 20 miles tomorrow slacking. Wish me luck!

The top of Unaka Mountain had an amazing spruce forest. It was beautiful and a little disorienting. The blazes were really the only way to see where the trail went. The fog also gave it a haunting Lost Woods feel. 
When the rain finally came down, it REALLY came down. The trail immediately turned into a river and the last miles back were a bit precarious. I still made it back it time for the food shuttle though! All is well in the world.Overall, the slackpack was nice, but it's a bit expensive, so I probably won't do it again. Definitely worth the try though!","Johnny's Hostel
",Iron Mountain Gap,"May 24, Wed",20.20
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566279,"Today just ran away with the prize for worst day on the trail. Also the first time since day 1 that I was legitimately concerned for my safety.
Today was mostly uphill, which I'm actually a fan of. It was scheduled to rain all day though, with wind gusts up to 50 mph. Not as much a fan of that. I didn't take a look at the map to see all the landmarks, I just told myself I'd get to the shelter 6 miles in, eat lunch, then take a look. 
After walking for what felt like a long time, I looked at my clock and saw it was 1. Still no shelter... This was definitely discouraging. I thought I was walking a decent pace, but apparently I wasn't even going 1.5 mph. I kept walking for another hour and still saw no shelter. Finally I pulled out my map. The first thing I saw was that the shelter was at the bottom of the smaller mountain before Roan. The mountain I had just climbed... Somehow I walked right past it. Granted, it was super foggy, but still... 
There was a brief break in the rain, so I figured I'd sit down and eat, since there'd be no rain cover until the final shelter of the day, so no use waiting. I got everything out and as soon as I did, the sky opened up again. I covered my pack real quick and just took my time eating in the pouring rain. I was kind of in a numb state of acceptance at this point. My last bite of my pb&j tortilla was more water than tortilla.
I headed back out, in slightly higher spirits, knowing I was actually going at a decent pace. Then I hit Roan mountain. I looked at the map and saw there was a parking lot I'd pass with a bathroom. That meant hot water, which I was very excited about. The rain mixed with the wind had made my hands quite cold. I passed two ladies who told me I was about an hour away. Totally doable. I passed a ton of trees on the way up that were in the process of falling. Their roots were pulled up and every gust of wind sent them leaning further and further down.
About two hours later, still no parking lot. At this point my hands were starting to go numb. Then I saw a sign. Carver's Gap. I wasn't sure what that meant in relation to the parking lot, so I checked the map. It was two miles past the shelter I was aiming for. The next shelter was in four miles. I had managed to somehow miss BOTH shelters AND a parking lot. How?! Again, it was foggy, but come on!
I took off my pack and did a quick self assessment. Another four miles would suck. I could rush and finish in an hour and a half maybe, but I was already losing feeling in my hands. I put them in my pants to warm them while I thought. I could backtrack two miles, but if I missed the shelter going uphill I had no reason to think I'd see it going downhill. And I'd have to walk it again in the morning. I figured I could probably do another four, but I really had to look out more carefully for trails, since there apparently aren't shelter signs here. 
I put my pack on and I noticed one shoulder strap was backwards. I tried to correct it, but my fingers weren't moving well enough. I kept trying for a minute until I noticed it wasn't backwards at all. Now any of you who know the symptoms of hypothermia can guess why this was a huge red flag for me. I was soaked, the wind was blowing, and I couldn't even tell if my pack strap was facing the right direction. I knew I had to warm up, so I started jogging up the trail. Then I thought, it's super muddy and rocky... It seems dangerous to be jogging. But honestly, I couldn't tell whether it was a bad idea, or whether hypothermia was just convincing me it was. I knew then I wasn't going to make it another 90 minutes.
I decided the first flat spot I passed, I'd pull off the trail and set up tent, heat up some water, get into dry clothes and call it a day. The problem was, all around me were the bare rocky balds of Roan and cliffs. I started panicking a little. Was I going to become a cautionary tale? God, not like this...
Then I saw another sign. Shelter .1 miles. I've never been so happy. I literally ran up the hill and almost cried when I saw the shelter. It even had a door! I went in and two guys were there eating. I dropped my stuff and they helped me heat up some water. My fingers couldn't work my lighter. I made tea, changed into dry clothes, then ate, slowly getting feeling back in my body. 
Apparently, the other sign had meant that Carver's Gap was coming up, not that I was at Carver's Gap. It's confusing here... I still have no idea how I missed that parking lot! Now I'm in the second story (yes, it's a two story shelter!) in my sleeping bag, listening to the massive wind outside, hoping no trees fall on me...","Iron Mountain Gap

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566280,"I woke up today around 7. Most of the time, that's when people are getting their stuff together to leave the shelter. It was freezing and we could hear the wind and rain outside. Not a single person left their sleeping bag. I went back to sleep. I woke up again around nine, expecting to be alone in the shelter. Not a single person had moved. I was meeting my wonderful wife at US 19E today though, so I had a long day of hiking ahead of me. I started getting ready and that seemed to stir the shelter into action.
I knew I'd be zeroing the next few days, so I broke a rule of mine and wore my dry sleeping clothes to hike in so I wouldn't have to put on cold wet clothes in a freezing shelter and walk through the wind and rain in them. I didn't regret it.
When I got to the bottom of Roan mountain though, it's like everything changed. The sun came out, day hikers were everywhere, there was grass... It was like stepping out of a dreary city and into a happy cartoon. 
I can honestly say, if it hadn't been raining the whole week (which caused most of the hike today to be through mud and water) today would have been the perfect hike. I'm definitely coming back here to section this again. Carver's Gap to US 19E  is the most beautiful day stretch yet. Lots of different terrain, and you don't just work hard for a payoff at the end of the hike, the entire hike is just breathtakingly gorgeous! Not enough good things to say about the Roan Highlands. I also got to see the iconic repurposed barn, which now serves as a very fancy shelter.
I ran into a teacher today who was teaching a class on hiking. He was taking his whole class on the Highlands hike. He asked if I was a thru hiker and when I said yes, called his whole class over to ask questions. I felt like a mini celebrity! It was a fun time. 
Of course, the best end to a good day was getting to see the love of my life. She drove over 12 hours down here to spend the weekend with me and our friends Crista and Rob, who are graciously hosting us this weekend. I'm very lucky to have such amazing people in my life! I'm taking a few zeroes here, but I'll see you all in a few days!","Roan mountain shelter

Other than signs though, Tennessee has a lot of beautiful water views between their rivers and waterfalls. (I'm actually camped right next to one now!) The waterfalls are a truly breathtaking sight. I find myself wishing Rebecca were here every time i get to a view. I know she would have really appreciated the past few days.
I forgot to mention, but I caught up with Tripp, Tiger, Tim and his wife, and someone from way back in the day. Granted, by walking past the shelter, I lost them again... But they'll be easy to find.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567075,"Last night was my best sleep on the trail so far. I fell right asleep, which never happens. I only woke up a few times, which never happens, and I was able to get back to sleep immediately. Then, I woke up at my 6:30 alarm fully awake! I didn't get up, mind you. I told my body to cool its jets and took advantage of being able to fall asleep by sleeping another two hours. It was awesome.
I wasn't sure if Tiger had passed me since I started so late, so I pushed on hoping to catch up. Never ran into them unfortunately, so I think they might be behind. 
I stopped at the Boots Off hostel for lunch. That place was super cute. I would have stayed if I didn't want to make it to Damascus so soon. But alas, I had a burger and soda, massaged my feet (which have been really sore the past few days) and pressed on.
I have one more criticism of Tennessee, then a little gushing. Tennessee is terrible at marking the trail at intersections. There will be some places with up to four different directions you can take, with no blazes to point you in the right direction. I had to ask for directions twice, and several other times I guessed and hoped for the best.
Tennessee has the best cell service yet though. Full bars everywhere! That's awesome. It also has the best water views. Waterfalls, rivers, lakes, they've got it all, and it's the prettiest water on the trail so far. 
I ended up catching up with Stud Muffin (who I haven't seen on the trail since Georgia), Sleeping Beauty, Parkour (who I met that night I almost died), and apparently I passed Smokes and the gang.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567261,"I decided I'd try for my longest day yet today. Didn't really know how it would go. I found out though! Painfully. But successfully!
I took two lunches and stopped at every water source to rub my feet. My feet still hurt a lot. I actually sat down about five miles short of my goal and had a mini hissy fit in my mind. My feet hurt too much to do another five miles. They hurt too much to do another mile. I just wanted to set my tent up and call it a day. 
Luckily, my hissy fit lasted just long enough for my feet to feel better. At least good enough to make the two miles to the next campsite. So I hiked on.
When I got to the campsite my feet were still doing well, so I decided to push on. Unfortunately, my hissy fit also lasted long enough for the sun to drop. I had to basically run the final three miles to the shelter. I got baited once by an out of service shelter. Finally I arrived though!Tomorrow I'll pay for it, but tonight, I'm proud. 
At the shelter there were a few people swapping stories. One guy I've run into a few times (CK) was telling one about a few nights ago at camp. When the sun went down, he started to see some animal eyes in the woods. They were close to the ground, so he assumed chipmunks or something. Then they started climbing the trees really fast, so he turned his light on, but there was nothing there. He turned his light off, and it was like they doubled immediately. He could tell they were all watching him too, since he could see the moon reflected in their eyes. Their movements were erratic and one looked like it was approaching him directly, so he waited until it was closer and flipped his light on again. Turns out they were fireflies, and his bad vision was making all of their lights double and look like eyes.

My knee started acting up today. It was mostly downhill, but it was super gradual, so I wasn't expecting any problems. Two miles out of town and I was limping real bad. 
I finally hit the town and limped to the Chipmunk Hostel to tent there. When I got there I found that a new town ordinance had been passed that banned all tenting on properties in town. Now you can only get rooms or bunks at hostels. And Chipmunk was full. I called six other hostels which were also all full. Finally, I got ahold of the Broken Fiddle Hostel which had bunks available. On the other side of town. There were a few other hikers listening to my disappointed conversations on the porch and one offered me a tall glass of mango orange juice and the other offered me a clementine. I like hikers. Hikers are nice.
Turns out Lightweight is at the Broken Fiddle as well, and I ran into TD on the way over. Apparently Smokes and Penny will be in Damascus a bit later. Everyone's catching up! Tiger and Chiro should be here tomorrow.

We'll also be hitting the Grayson Highlands soon! I can't wait. I'm super pumped. Also made a spreadsheet today to keep track of how many miles I'd need to hike per day if I decided not to flip flop (assuming no zeroes) and then how many I'd need to walk assuming one zero a week (or two Neros). In case you're wondering, it's 14.63 and 17.07 respectively. I'm still probably going to flip flop, but knowing the numbers and knowing it'd be possible to end at Katahdin is nice.

I got to the first shelter and stopped for lunch and tried to dry my tent fly out. I gave it an hour of hanging, but somehow it got no drier. Ah well. 
I left the shelter with Grizz and we hiked the rest of the day together. He has a fast pace, so it helped me. When left to my own devices I often start daydreaming and my pace slows to my natural meandering walking speed. Grizz kept me on track to hit the goal shelter.
There were some great views today, and the hiking wasn't too bad at all. I saw ponies in the distance! Tomorrow I'll see them up close! 
We got to the shelter in time to eat and hang our bear bags, then the sun disappeared and it was incredibly cold. It's supposed to drop to pretty low today, so we're all huddled in our bags.

Rebecca picked Lightweight and I up from the trail and we grabbed lunch at Sonic, resupplied and met Grizz for dinner at a Mexican restaurant. Grizz told them it was my birthday. We were expecting a free dessert or a song. They came out with a dessert with whipped cream on it and proceeded to smear the whipped cream all through my hair and beard. It was unexpected. I could style my hair with it though and I looked flyyyyy.

Right at the end of a long downhill, I decided to take a break and rub my feet. After a little while a car drove up and dropped off General Hendrix. He was slackpacking 2.8 miles. The lady driving the car (Chunky, the owner of the 1/4 Way Hostel) then offered to slackpack us for free! We gave her our packs (hoping the whole time that she was ACTUALLY the owner of the hostel and not someone trying to steal bags...) and we hit the trail.
That was the most chill 2.8 miles ever. We were basically running the whole way. It was amazing. When we got to the rendezvous spot, she had our packs and some Gatorade for us all. That was some amazing trail magic. We were at a pavilion at this point.
Me - Only two more miles until we can eat lunch at the shelter!Grizz - Do you just want to eat here?Me - Yes, yes I do.
So we ate under the pavilion and chilled with General Hendrix.
Me - Alright, we saved about thirty minutes by slackpacking, so we should be able to get into camp early, start a fire, set up -Also Me - *Naps for thirty minutes*

We headed out around 9. I thought the first half of the day was going to suck, but the second half would be chill. Grizz thought the first half of the day would be chill and the second half would suck. We were both half right, and not in the way either of us wanted to be...
The morning uphills were brutal. The only saving grace was I had my first bear sighting! It was a baby, so it was adorable. I didn't see Mama around though, so I didn't stick around for photos.

In a previous post I mentioned slackpacking was pretty expensive. That is apparently not always the case! Jeremy from the Days Inn Hostel dropped us off at the trail head and dropped off our bags 18 miles down the trail when we got there, all for $5 each. We honestly couldn't afford NOT to slackpack at that price. He thru hiked last year, and I think he was the most generous of any hostel we've stayed at so far. Super accommodating, amazing prices, gave us some free snacks... Overall good dude.
Today was like a dream. We did the first 18 miles so fast, and felt great afterwards. Nothing was sore and at the end of the 18 miles there was a convenience store that made fresh burgers and pizza. I had already had a burger for breakfast (and dinner the night before) but after 18 miles, I wanted another burger, damnit! It was delicious. Got some onion rings and chocolate milk too. The dream!

When I did wake up I was able to take down camp, eat, and hit the trail by nine. My normal time!
I felt much better today, physically. I decided to hike to music since I was by myself. The first song that came on was On Your Porch, by The Format. I legit almost cried. It was the song I listened to on repeat on the plane when I left Connecticut to follow my dream to California. It's about having to leave what you love, and following your dreams, and even if you fail, your have people in your life who will always be proud of you. It hit me hard. 
The hike today wasn't too tough, and there were a few views and some cool rock formations to explore. When I got to the road, Grizz was able to hook me up with a shuttle to the hostel we were staying at. We both assumed we'd see Lightweight on the way to pick her up, but she took a different route and had to walk the mile into town. Sorry Lightweight! 
We had some AYCE Chinese (for seven dollars!), did our resupply (my food bag weighs WAY too much now), and headed back to the hostel for laundry, a shower, and to dry my tent. Now we're chilling and cooking a party size lasagna (5 lbs 10 oz) for the three of us. Back to the trail tomorrow! No more zeroes for us. You know... Until there is.","Doc's Knob Shelter

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568983,"The first uphill today was short, but painful. My right hip had a stabbing pain every step I took with my right foot. I was a little worried, because I sure wasn't going to make the rest of the day's hike with that happening. Luckily, by the second uphill it had stopped.
We ducked into a shelter to dodge a storm. The shelter had an amazing view. You feel like you could see all of Virginia from there! You could see the clear separation of towns, just like a game board or something. Very nice view for the effort that went into it.
After about two hours, we decided to just stay here the night and head out early tomorrow for a twenty mile day. It was going to keep raining periodically and not carrying a wet tent tomorrow sounded great to me. Tomorrow also looks super flat, so it shouldn't be too rough a day.","Angel's Rest Hostel

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569302,"Last night, two guys came into camp and started cooking dinner while a few other of us sat around the picnic table. One pulled out his stove, pulled out some bread and cheese, then put a rock on his stove to make a bigger surface so he could make grilled cheese. It was pretty awesome. Unfortunately, right before he turned his stove off, the rock overheated and exploded. Luckily no one was hurt. The only casualty was one of Grizz's ziplock bags, which had a hole melted completely through it from rock shrapnel. So let that be a lesson! Rocks can overheat and explode.
I met a guy named Woodsy who tried to thru hike last year. He made it 30 miles from the Maine border (about 1900 miles into the hike) and blew out his knee and had to end his hike. First of all, how devastating must that be? So this year, instead of picking up where he left off, he's doing another full thru hike! Fucking legend.
Today wasn't too bad looking on the map, so we decided to do 20. For the most part, we were right. Leading up to the last shelter before the campsite we wanted to stop at, there was a ridiculous uphill. It was so steep. And there was no water at the shelter, so you had to stop halfway up the hill, then take a side path down a steep hill for water, then back up, then finish the ridiculous uphill. It wasn't fun. I was absolutely drenched. At the shelter we decided to stop and eat before heading on, but then some dark clouds and cold winds rolled in. We were all planning to rush under the shelter with our food, but it held off for us! We ate quickly and continued on. 
The rest of the hike was rocky, but not too bad. When we got to the campsite, there was a gorgeous view right next to it. It was an amazing way to end the day, and the clouds seemed to clear our just so we could enjoy it.","Rice meadow shelter

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569303,"Today looked a bit harder on the map, so we didn't shoot for anything crazy. We also got a later start so Lightweight could start with us. She had camped out by the water source a mile back. 
Started with a downhill, which is always nice. The uphill was a bit tough, but I was excited to see Kelly's knob. I had it highlighted, which meant I had heard good things. Wasn't super impressed though. Lots of trees grown in blocked most the view. Ah well. 
We got to see the Keffer Oak, which is the largest tree on the southern half of the trail, which is probably a title they bitterly hold while waiting for the biggest tree in the northern half to fall. It was pretty awesome. Nature's crazy man.
The rain had been threatening all day, but it had held off. Honestly, it's been like that for a few days, and it makes for great hiking. It's not too hot, it's not too wet, and you get occasional cold breezes to cool you off, or a minute or two of rain after an uphill. I can't imagine how hot this would be in full sun. The clouds are cool in my book. We passed a field though, and all the cows were laying down. Uh oh. We decided to up the pace a bit to get to the final shelter.
The final shelter was preceded by an area that was flat on the map, but the elevation values went up by 700. We couldn't tell whether it was a typo, or the picture was wrong. We hoped for the former. It was the latter. Straight up, this was the hardest climb on the trip so far. Maybe it was that we were hungry and it was the end of the day, but I've never been so exhausted on an uphill.
Finally it ended and we were treated to a great view, some wild blackberries, and a downhill walk to one of the fanciest shelters I've seen. I'm currently in my tent under the pavilion of the shelter. That's right, it has a covered pavilion! And there's only one other person staying in the shelter portion, so I don't even feel bad.
Lightweight hates uphills, so we didn't think we'd see her tonight with how hard the climbs were (and her already doing an extra mile today) but she came rolling into camp before dark like a champion. Someone at the last shelter tried to talk her into staying there, but she was having none of it.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569445,"I woke up nice and early this morning ready to start the day. I got all packed up, got my food bag, and started breakfast. Then I remembered I accidentally broke my lighter and couldn't make coffee, so I looked over to where Lightweight and Grizz were hanging to see if they had one handy. They were both fast asleep. I woke them up to ask, since I figured it was getting late anyway. I got a lighter and had some coffee, but we didn't end up leaving the shelter until about 10. So much for my morning motivation! I'll never have that kind of energy in the morning again. 
Today we had a lot of gorgeous ridgewalks. We even got to see McAfee's. Knob, which we'll be at in two days. It looked ridiculously far away. I tried to get a picture, but I think it was too far to even see in it. It's crazy to think of how far we go in two days. Thinking in terms of miles, 38 doesn't seem like too many to walk, but the distance is very different when actually seeing it.
We only had one serious uphill today, but it was a 3.5 mile uphill, so it was pretty serious. After the past two days though, it wasn't as bad. There was a memorial at the top for the most decorated war hero in American history. There was an overlook to the side of it, and there was another smaller memorial for another veteran there. I would hate to be the guy with the memorial right next to the most decorated war hero in history. That's a bum deal, man. Though it probably gets a lot of traffic, so that's something.
The shelter today was another .3 off the trail. Bad luck with those lately. Grizz and I set up camp at a spot that looked like it had a decent flat spot for my tent and good trees for him and Lightweight. Shortly after, Indiana Jane stopped by to see if she could set up her tent with us. Then Boyscout and his dog Mountain Goat came by to see if they could set up with us. Then Giggles stopped by to eat before night hiking. Then Lightweight showed up. Finally, Wild Spirit and Sarumon showed up and set up their tents. There were a lot of other camping spots in the area, but apparently we're where the party's at! 
Looks to be the first night without rain in a while. Excited to tent and not pack up a wet rainfly! Doubly excited to see the love of my life tomorrow and spend a few days together!","Sarver Hollow Shelter
",Pickle Branch Shelter,"Jun 20, Tue",16.10
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569507,"We decided to start out a little later today (surprise surprise). We were the last ones out of our party spot. The uphill wasn't as steep, but it was pretty rocky. Not the annoying ankle breaker rocks, but the boulders you have to climb. I'm much cooler with those. It was a fun change of pace.
The trip down was a little terrifying. We ran into our first spots with ladder steps embedded into the rocks to climb down. My knees were really feeling it by the time we got downhill.
Luckily, at the bottom of the hill there was a shuttle waiting. They were taking hikers to a nearby community center where they were serving free burgers, fruit, resupply items and lots of other stuff. It was amazing. After eating, we played some basketball and decided instead of doing the last six miles, we'd wait for Rebecca at the community center. No regrets. It was a great break.
We met a hiker named Cashback there. Me: Are you thru hiking or doing a section?Cashback: Just doing a section.Me: Where you headed? Cashback: New York.Me: Oh wow! That's a long section. Where did you start?Cashback: Springer.Me: ... So you're doing a 1600 mile section? There must be a better name for that.Cashback: Closest thing is probably a failed thru hike.Me: Section hike it is.
When Rebecca got there, we went to Salem, VA and grabbed a few rooms at a Day's Inn, got a delicious dinner and decided to zero tomorrow (after twelve days with no zero) and slackpack 25 miles on Friday. Weather pending...","Pickle Branch Shelter

I woke up at about two am to a terrible Charlie horse in my calf. It hurt. A lot. I woke up at 5:30, preparing for a 25 mile day, but not wanting to get out of bed, a part of me hoping the cramp had made me unable to walk today. No such luck. It still hurt, but I knew walking it off was probably best for it anyway. 
Rebecca woke up feeling sick, so she couldn't even join us for McAfee's Knob, which is the whole reason she drove down here from CT. 
When we got to McAfee's, we witnessed a proposal! That was pretty awesome. I got a picture and shared it with the couple. I also got some classic McAfee pictures. There we headed to Tinker Cliffs and got MORE great pictures! 
Unfortunately, after Tinker Cliffs, my knees really started acting up. Then my right ankle. Then my left foot. They stayed that way for the final 9 miles. Then my phone battery died. Right then, we started one of the most beautiful ridgewalks I've ever seen. It was straight out of Lord of the Rings. I wish I could have gotten a picture, but it probably wouldn't have been the same anyway.
Anywho, at the end of the day, we were all in so much pain, we're zeroing tomorrow. Now we know, we're not 25 mile hikers. Under 20 for us from now on.","Newport Road

This also meant we finally got to eat at the Home Place. It's a great AYCE place that's only open Thursday through Sunday. It was amazing.
Today I said a sad farewell to Rebecca, then we headed out. Hobbled out might be a more apt description. I have two blisters on the bottom of my foot and my knee was still sore from hiking, Grizz's knees and ankle were still sore, and Lightweight was breaking in new shoes. None of us were in top shape. Luckily the terrain was easy. It really didn't even feel like 11 miles. Even moving slowly and leaving at around 11:30, we made it to camp at around 6.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570082,"I didn't realize how much I was avoiding putting weight on my blister yesterday, but I certainly felt it this morning. Favoring my bad knee all day was a bad plan. Today I planned to make a concentrated effort to put more weight on my blister. It would hurt, but it'd get better. I have no such certainty about putting extra weight on my bad knee.
With a plan like that, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I walked very slow today. Luckily the terrain was easy, but I was slowing everyone down. We even ended up stopping three miles early for time purposes
There were a lot of beautiful views today on the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was overall a great hike and a great day to be hiking. We even came across a bit of trail magic! First, a man we ran into yesterday came back with beer and donuts, then we ran into an older couple who invited us to sit with them and share their fruit and cookies. 
At the end of the day, I decided to lance the blister. It hurt too much today, and it didn't seem like it would callous up. This is the first blister I've had to lance all trip. It hurt. Not nearly as much as I'm sure it will tomorrow though. I'm hoping it doesn't refill. If it does, I'll have to try Lightweight's strategy of leaving a piece of string in there to keep it from refilling. Fingers crossed it doesn't come to that...","Wilson Creek Shelter

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570160,"I forgot to mention it last post, but we sent all our cold weather gear home with Rebecca. We waited two weeks past when traditional wisdom suggests doing so, just to be careful. In classic fashion, as soon as we sent our stuff home, a cold spell hit. Two days ago was in the low forties, last night was in the high forties...tomorrow looks like it's going to get to 32 degrees. The coldest night I've ever had in trail was 32 degrees, and even with my winter gear, it was really rough. With no sleeping bag, sweatshirt, or hat/gloves, absolutely not. 
We'd already gone two days with basically no sleep, so we weren't about to try to brave a night that was almost freezing. We didn't even have a sleeping bag to tuck our filters into to keep them from freezing! 
Grudgingly, we walked three miles and caught a shuttle to a campground that rented cabins for hikers, with heat and everything! I'm glad there was at least something like that close by. We were hoping they could pick us up from the 16 mile mark instead of three miles, but no such luck. On the bright side, my foot didn't hurt at all today after the lancing! 
At the campground, we ran into a bunch of familiar faces. Turbo Turtle, Cheese, Cowboy, Aquaman, and a lady we've been trying to avoid, but keep ending up at the same place, despite our sporadic mileage the past few days. We met her at lunch one day and she didn't say anything to us and we didn't say anything to her. We were afraid we were being rude, but she was definitely giving an ""I don't want to talk"" vibe. Then we stayed the same place that night, so I tried striking up conversation while we were all cooking together. She wasn't having it. I said hi and she looked up, but didn't respond. I asked her name and she sighed heavily, before mumbling an answer I didn't catch. I got the feeling I probably shouldn't ask her to repeat herself. We all just ate in awkward silence. Next day we only did 13 miles, so we weren't expecting to see her, but she was there again. She avoided us entirely this time. I assume she's just not a social hiker, so when we hiked three miles and called it quits, imagine our surprise when we saw her again by the pool! She was just sitting nearby and sighed heavily when we approached, so we decided to hold off on swimming. Tomorrow we'll do some big miles and see if we run into her again. At that point she's either following us or she'll think we're following her...

We woke up today with the intention of being ready by 6:30 and leaving by 7. We woke to our alarms at 6. It was freezing. Even in the cabin. It was hot when we went to bed, so we didn't bother putting the space heater on, and by the time it was cold, no one wanted to get out of their beds to turn it in. Woops. So we got a bit delayed. 
As we were getting ready to close out our tabs, I made the unhappy discovery that my wallet wasn't in my pack. I looked in every pocket, emptied every bag, looked through all my clothes...nothing. I looked through the cabin again, then called the hotel we stayed at last. No luck. I called Rebecca to have her check the car and my sweatshirt that I sent home. Nada. I called the last restaurant I remember having it at, but they're closed today. I also remembered I was wearing town clothes that Rebecca had brought for me that night, so it was probably in the pocket of those pants if anything, but they were at my parents house and she was spending the night with a friend, so no idea on that one yet either. I'm crossing my fingers. I really don't want to have to cancel my cards, get a new license, hey a new debit card, etc. 
For now, Lightweight is covering my expenses until I can pay her back. She and Grizz were both quick to offer, which I can't even begin to say how much I appreciate. 
Today was mostly uphill, but nothing as extreme as the uphills from the other week. My foot seems to be completely healed now, so we made pretty good time! Not a lot of views today, but we did pass the Guillotine, which is a pretty neat rock formation.

Today was a pretty easy day and I was feeling great. Always a good combo. I spent the day brainstorming various things, got some good ideas down that I'm pretty excited about, and made it to our road crossing very early.
Then came the hitching... There was the three of us, plus another couple that got there a bit before us. No one was stopping. Then a shuttle came for someone who came after us. He had room for two more, so we would have had to split up, and I figured the other couple should have the spot anyway. Just then, a car stopped that had room for three. Lightweight and the couple hopped in there and Grizz and I hopped in the other car. Lucky timing!

We woke up at the amazing shelter and Lightweight had egg and cheese bagel sandwiches waiting for us. We picked up the ground beef from the store for our planned pasta feast and prepared to head out. It was tough, because that place was awesome and the company was great, but we didn't want to get sucked into the vortex. 
The person shuttling people back to the trail left at eight and said he'd be right back for us. We waited about three hours and finally got a ride from someone else. 
There was a 30% chance of rain today, which means it rained today. We met Grizz's cousin G at one of the gaps and he joined our merry band. We all planned to meet up at a campsite near a river about 15 miles out. When Grizz, G and I got to where the camp was supposed to be, nothing. There was a spot for one tent and zero hammocks. We looked all around, but couldn't find anything. 
We set up Grizz's rainfly while we waited for Lightweight and I set up my tent when there was a break in the rain. Grizz and G decided to just cowboy camp under the tarp for the night. Then we got hungry and started to prepare the pasta, thinking it might be ready when she got there. Welp, my new fuel canister didn't work, so Grizz had to cook all the beef. Then we traded fuel cannisters and that seemed to fix the problem. He heated up the sauce and I made the pasta. Almost. I burnt the pasta and ran out of fuel... That's about the time Lightweight got there. 
She took over pasta duty and made some non burnt pasta. The burnt pasta kind of screwed the bottom of my pot too. The whole time, puddles of water were slowly moving toward us from the nonstop rain. By the time the pasta was done, we were all sitting in puddles. Grizz and G had decided this swamp would not be a good place to cowboy camp and hiked onto the next shelter five miles away at about 10:30 pm, while Lightweight and I decided to just stay and meet them in the morning.

I was exhausted and sweaty and not in a great headspace. When I got there, Grizz and G had headed into town already, so I took off my shoes and socks and waded in the river while I waited for Lightweight. We ended up sharing all the eggs between the two of us, and even got a bagel and cheese with them. 
Stomach full, I headed the two miles to the road to hitch into town for a resupply. That also felt like ten miles. I don't know what it is today, but I just don't want to be here right now. Here's hoping it passes. I'd been doing so well staving off the Virginia Blues thus far.
Update: We all decided to call it a day after seven miles. We got a hitch into town and found a free Campsite with hot (and awesome) showers, electricity, and a river right next to it. There's also an ice cream place next to it that gives a free ice cream cone to thru hikers. Then some townies gave us a free watermelon. The day turned for the better!
We were even able to find a hitch to the grocery store for resupply and then G talked to a guy at the grocery store to get us a ride back. We brought back chicken and charcoal to grill at the campsite. Grizz handled it like a pro.
Tomorrow we're hoping to get a ride super early so we can finish our big uphill before the sun gets too crazy. We'll see how that goes. We'll also be conserving fuel a bit since I'm out, Lightweight is almost out, and Grizz has half a canister.

We were going to hitch, but Downhill (a girl we met on the trail yesterday) was being visited from her boyfriend from Pennsylvania, and he offered to drive us the 10 miles to the trailhead. Downhill wasn't even going to the same trailhead as us, so it was basically 20 miles out of the way. Super nice of him! Then to top it off, it turned out he had extra fuel in his trunk for Downhill that she didn't need, so he gave me a brand new fuel canister and refused any money for it. His name was Nick. Super nice guy. I hope I can return the favor someday!
So the day started with a three mile uphill that went up 2000 feet. That's pretty steep for that length. I was basically running up the hill though and made it in an hour, feeling really good the whole time. I finished the next peak shortly after, then it started to rain. It was freezing cold rain, but it felt pretty good after the uphill. Only lasted a few minutes luckily! 
The rest of the hike went by in a blur. No views, but it didn't bother me. I was just walking along lost in thought. I got to the shelter pretty early and was thinking about going on, but I didn't know how everyone else would feel and the bugs were bad and made me want a tent to hide from them in, so I just set up camp. It's just as well, since my wallet is being mailed to Waynesboro, but probably won't be there until the fifth, so rushing there just means spending more money in town.
I think I've found my favorite pre dinner now. About four slices of summer sausage fried with a spoonful of butter and mixed with salt and pepper, then after I eat that, I cook ramen in the pot with all the grease still there. It makes the ramen taste great, the ramen basically cleans my pot, and then I'm ready for second dinner in an hour or two.","Buena Vista, VA

I had to say goodbye to Rebecca again today, which is always hard. G and Grizz had a bit too much to drink last night, so they're staying in town to nurse their hangover while Lightweight and I head out. After I got on trail, I realized I forgot to refill my water bottles. I had 1/4 liter of water. No biggie, this happens sometimes. There's usually a lot of water around, so let me just check the nearest water source, aaaand 7 miles. I need to make it 7 miles with 1/4 liter of water. I drink less than most my traveling companions, but that's stretching it even for me. But alas, what choice did I have? I headed out.
The hiking wasn't too bad. It started uphill for a bit. After hiking for a while, I noticed I hadn't seen a white blaze in a while. I walked for about a mile and I couldn't remember the last blaze I saw. Some sections of the trail are more sparse with the blazes than others, but not this distance. Begrudgingly, I headed back the way I came, assuming I'd see blazes in the other direction if I had been going the right way, or I'd pass Lightweight. Neither happened. I finally saw the turn I missed though, and got on the right track. This is the first time I've really gone the wrong way, and I really didn't have the water for it. I finally ended up catching up to Lightweight and she gave me another 1/4 liter, which helped a bit.
When I finally got to the water source, I ran into Turbo Turtle and Cheese and Tunnel Rat. They were heading out, but it was still nice to see a familiar face.

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571330,"I got some great sleep last night, and we got a really early start today, waking up at 5:30 and out of camp by 6:30. This was the first Campground with the bear poles, so we got to try them out. They're basically a tall pole with many hooks at the top, and you put your food onto another metal pole then lift it up and try to get it onto it one of the hooks. The pole you're holding onto is super heavy though! Not as easy as I was expecting... There was an older gentleman sleeping there as well, and I had to get his food up and down as well, the pole was so heavy.
Thanks to the early start, we got to the first shelter at 13 miles by noon. Definitely felt pretty accomplished! We ran into Turbo Turtle and Cheese there as well! After eating and taking a quick nap, we were back off.
So far, the Shenandoahs haven't impressed me with views, but they have had super easy hiking, so I've been ok with it. The second half of the day though, we actually got some decent vistas AND easy hiking!
We decided to stop near the Loft Campgrounds. They're one of those pay per site places. It was $15 for a tent spot, so we just stealth camped instead. Found a spot right on an overlook! Super lucky. It was close enough to the official sites that we could still use the bathroom, trash, and store though. And we did. Got some ice cream, Yoohoo, candy and a roast beef sandwich from the store. It was amazing after the long day. It all came to about a 1500 calorie dinner. Lightweight's was about 2000.  #hikerhealthy?

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571437,"Another early morning! We just wanted to go 15 today to see how we were feeling, then maybe push onto the Elkton road crossing and meet up with Grizz and G.
I met a section hiker who was out with his friends for a month. He was a senior in high school who did an experiment to see how people reacted to various fonts on street signs all over the world. Apparently we don't do great in the us with our font, but England has an effective one. Neat stuff.
I ran into Turbo Turtle and Cheese again when I hit the 900 mark. I seem to magically run into them every time there's a cool picture to be taken! Very lucky. We did some 900 pictures and headed on.
I ended a bit early waiting for Lightweight. She was meandering and spent some more time at the camp store. I was feeling up for more miles today since I finished 15 by three, but I guess it'll be nice to have a bear pole and campfire tonight. It feels like it'll be a chilly one. 
Tomorrow we can try to knock out another 12 by 12, sync up with Grizz and G, and end close to 18 or 19. Should be another camp store tomorrow near the end of the day, so we can treat ourselves again. Also, full moon tonight! Almost want to night hike... But I already set up my tent...","Loft Mountain Campground

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571583,"Didn't wake up as early as expected this morning. It was cold outside and I was warm inside my comfy cocoon. I still managed too be up by 6, but not early enough to summit and see the sunrise.
After several days in the Shenandoahs, here's my official comparison to the other big park we've gone through so far:

Permit process - Advantage: Shenandoahs. The permit was free and you could fill out the form on the trail, so no printers required
Hiking - Advantage: Shenandoahs. The hiking has been super easy and the trails have been pretty soft and not quite as rocky as the Smokies.
Views - Advantage: Smokies. The views there are on another level due to the elevation. Though in terms of the ratio of work required for view to beauty of view, Shenandoahs wins by a lot. 
Rules - Advantage: Shenandoahs. Stealth camping is allowed if you follow certain rules, you have plenty of time to make it out of the park, no crazy shelter rules, and dogs are allowed.
 Privies - Advantage: Shenandoahs. The Privies here are clean, don't smell awful and don't have a lot of flies. Some shelters in the Smokies didn't even have Privies.
Shelters - Advantage: Smokies. Two layer shelters with fireplaces built into each one and tarps to block the wind. Those were pretty dope.
Amenities - Advantage: Shenandoahs. There are many pay-to-camp places with bathrooms, showers, laundry, and stores to resupply. They also allow stealth camping nearby, so you can use the amenities for free!
Seclusion - Advantage: Smokies. You cross roads several times a day in the Shenandoahs. When you're not crossing the road, you're walking alongside it. The pay-to-camp areas are full of day hikers with campers, trucks and all the luxuries of a home. You never really feel like you're in the wilderness.

So there you have it. Choose a park based on which of those is more important to you.
Some random sidenotes today: A passing hiker said I looked like Shia LaBeouf (specifically he said I look like the ""Just do it!"" guy), I broke my non slack pack mileage record, I set up a day to visit my sister Virginia this week, and as I tried to get to camp before the sun set, I found I can jog a full five miles with 30 lbs on my back, so that's neat.","Hightop Hut

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571732,"I knew today was going to be lighter than yesterday so I slept in a little. What I mean to say is my alarm went off at 5:30 and I felt like I had been hit by a truck, so I went back to sleep. By seven I was feeling a bit better though. 
Lightweight is having some leg problems that we're hoping pass, so since I'm zeroing with my sister on Saturday anyway, I'm just going ahead and we'll meet up when I get back on the trail after. Grizz and G are back on the trail, so I was able to sync with them today. Penny is catching up too, and Smokes is aqua blazing the Shenandoahs with Downhill. It'll be like a reunion soon!
We ran into our friend Runaway today (he's the one who drove us to the trail in Glasgow when our shuttle fell through) and he apparently just got a $280 ticket for having a nug of weed. So for all you smokers out there, be cool in the Shennies. They'll getcha.
I'm going to bed early tonight to make up for yesterday's lack of sleep, and I'll actually wake up early so we can do a 23 mile day and officially be out of the Shenandoahs.","Rock Spring Hut

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571804,"I passed out early last night and slept like a log. I can't remember all my dreams, but I remember one.
Dream One: I dreamt that I groggily woke up and noticed I had left the bottom zipper of my tent undone. Then, a deer starting poking its head in. I tiredly pushed it away, saying ""Noooo. I don't want you in here!"" Eventually it forced its whole body in though, and I was like, well as long as you're in here, I'm going to get a picture, because no one will believe this. Unfortunately, every time I tried to take a picture, the deer would hide behind something in my tent: Behind my bag, under my sheets...you know, all places a full grown deer could feasible hide. Eventually I was like ""Well if you won't let me take a picture, you can't stay here!"" and I wrestled it out of my tent.
In case you're wondering, I did check my phone for those pictures this morning, but didn't find anything.
Today's hike was a long one. Luckily, we got to stop after seven miles for a burger at one of the waysides. An expensive burger, but whatever. It hit the spot, and you can't put a price on that! (Actually you can. It was 7.50)
We saw lots of bears today, including lots of moms and cubs. Some from a distance...some from closer than I would have liked... By the end of the day, I was completely bushed. I was basically hobbling into camp. Tomorrow will be another kind of big day, then a lighter one to meet Virginia. Here's hoping I'm not completely wrecked tomorrow.","Pass mountain hut
",Tom Floyd Shelter,"Jul 12, Wed",23.60
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571955,"Right before I fell asleep last night, two section hikers came into camp. They had a lot of camp chores to do when they got in, so it was pretty loud for a while. Not their fault, just bad luck. After that, I couldn't fall asleep. It was just too hot. It was crazy. 
I woke up today pretty tired, but still up for 18 miles. Grizz and G were passed out. I headed out around 8 and they were just about waking up. They hike faster than me though, so I figured they'd catch up.
Shortly into the day, I started feeling a weird pain behind my left shoulder blade and in the ball of my left foot. Also, it was super hot today. It all made for uncomfortable hiking. I decided to just push to Ashby Gap and see if my sister could pick me up today instead. It would mean an extra five miles, but it would also mean a double zero. I decided this was best.
9 am, 70 degree, downhill John loved this idea. 3 pm, 85+ degree, uphill John was a little peeved. But I think it was ultimately the right call. Extra time with family and extra time to heal.
I ate lunch today at a shelter with a solar shower, horseshoe pit, a covered lunch area... It was nice! Would love more shelters like that! I also saw Smokes and Blackalachian today! It was truly a day of reunions.
The end of the day I wasn't nearly as exhausted as I was expecting to be. I must have been super pumped about the zeroes and it was powering my body, because nobody else was out hiking today. I saw one other person hiking and dozens of hikers just waiting for the sun to go down to start hiking.
I met Virginia at the end, we grabbed some dinner, caught up, and now I'm showered, my laundry is almost done, and I'm looking forward to a great night's sleep!","Tom Floyd Shelter

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572216,"My zeroes were great! I got to see family, I finally got to see Virginia's house, Gin took me out for a fancy haircut and shave, I got to have some decent ramen, I got to be there for Kiara turning six, I saw Spider-Man, I even got a new shirt, some new socks, pants and boots... It was eventful and great.
I was expecting everyone I hiked with to have passed me since I took two days off, but as soon as we pulled into the trail head I saw Cheese and Turbo Turtle and Tunnel Rat. Lucky!
Today, I embarked on the Roller Coaster. It's a thirteen mile section of ups and downs that's supposed to be very intense. It had it's moments, but I think it was a bit overhyped. Just another day on the AT! It was a bit harder since I'm breaking in new shoes though. These ones feel like a dream when I go over rocks and roots. I don't even feel them! But that extra padding means a higher shoe, and I've been tripping and turning my ankles a bit trying to get used to the height difference. I'm hoping I get it locked down soon!
There was a super cool hostel in the middle with cheap cold drinks and ice cream. This place was super fancy and old looking. It basically looked like a castle. It was awesome. Bear's Den Hostel. Look it up!
More exciting though, is I officially broke 1000 miles AND am finally out of Virginia! It's a whole new trail now. Tomorrow I'll walk into Harper's Ferry, get my picture taken, see the love of my life, and enjoy another day off with her. Life is good!","Ashby Gap

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572451,"Today I finally get to Harper's Ferry! While not the technical halfway point, that's still where they take the halfway pictures for the ATC. We can see when people ahead of us got there and we can leave contact info for those behind us. 
The hike there wasn't bad, but it was super hot and super rocky. There was also about ten miles without water and I thought one liter of water was enough because it was flat. I was wrong. I mean, I guess I was right because I didn't die, but it wasn't comfortable. 
I'm getting more used to the shoes, which is nice. Less ankle turning, but the same amount of tripping and toe stubbing. Those aren't as bad because they don't hurt. I'm just hoping I get more used to them before Pennsylvania.
When I got to Harper's I got my number (1601) and Rebecca met us there! She brought cookies and herself which are two of the best things ever. Zero tomorrow, rest tonight!","Raven Rocks Campsite

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572552,"I didn't want to get out of bed this morning. That would mean that we'd have to leave the hotel and Rebecca would have to leave. It's always very hard saying goodbye to her, knowing that all I have to do is say the word and she could take me back with her. It's a huge test every single time she visits, but it's one I think I need to give myself. It'd be much harder if I couldn't see her at all. 
So today we stopped at the ATC before heading out. We finally ran into Penny there! After weeks of sprinting, she has caught up. And she'll probably pass us pretty soon! Good to see almost all of the old ""Smoke Machine Apache Dream"" crew. And with Apache relocating to our corner of the country, we might get to see all of them by the end!
Today was a short day. We didn't leave until after noon and it was hot. Super hot. Everyone kept saying it was going to be flat, but I've learned to distrust people who say that. Today though, they were right! It actually was an almost entirely flat day! One short uphill and that's pretty much all the elevation change for the ten miles. 
The trail passed through town, which was absolutely adorable. Lots of historical buildings and memorials. Then it moved onto a trail that walked along the Shenandoah river. I waded in at one point and wet my hat. The water was pretty darn warm though. If I weren't afraid of soaking my underwear day one back on the trail, I would have jumped in. After that, there was a state park with more civil war history. It was a great walk today! I wish the whole trail could be like this, but also magically have views. If only...
The shelter here was .3 off trail, but it's awesome! The tent sites are amazing, the shelter is small, but fancy, and I haven't checked out the privy yet, but I've got high expectations!
Tomorrow the plan is to wake up at five, get out of camp by 6:30, walk until noon, siesta until four, then walk until seven. Hoping to beat a lot of the heat that way. We'll see though. It's certainly not my first plan that's started with ""I'm going to wake up at five"" and not many of them go as planned...","Harper's Ferry
",Crampton Gap Shelter,"Jul 19, Wed",11
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572642,"Ok, so I stuck MOSTLY to plan. And the part I strayed from isn't the part you're probably thinking.
I woke up at five this morning and got out of camp by six thirty. So far so good. Then I ran into Chipmunk, Hazmat, Blackalachian and met a hiker named Blaze, who had apparently been following my log book entries. I hung out with them for a bit, used the running water there to do dishes, and almost charged my backup battery, but the outlet was full. I wasn't too far behind at this point. Then there was another park with running water. I sat at a picnic table with the same gang, but with Giggles added, used the bathroom then headed out. Then there was a park with tons of civil war info. I had to stop for that! Then there was the original Washington Monument, which had a beautiful view. 
I ended up getting to my siesta shelter at around 1:15, so I hiked a bit longer in the sun than I wanted, but made it fine. There was a nice lady there who was hiking Maryland and we talked while I ate lunch. Chipmunk and Hazmat showed up with the same idea I had. They convinced me to stay a bit longer than I was planning. To be fair, it was still very hot at 3:30. 
We left around 4:30 and stopped at the Annapolis Rocks. They were pretty! Then we hit the road again. At this point, we were almost guaranteed to have to night hike to make it to the shelter. The five miles leading to the shelter were also rocks. Just rocks. It sucked. Two miles short of the shelter my knee had had enough and Hazmat and I pulled off the trail and found some flat spots for our tents. We'll have to wake up early tomorrow, because I don't think you're supposed to stealth camp in Maryland, but I wasn't night hiking on those rocks. That's not how my trip ends.","Crampton Gap Shelter
",Stealth camp spot,"Jul 20, Thu",18.70
Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572747,"Today wasn't the best.
I started the day feeling a bit off. Nothing bad really happened, but mentally I had already started my week countdown. As I started walking more, the top of my foot started hurting. It had started last night, but I was able to ignore it after a while. Today there was no ignoring it. 
I could tell immediately it wasn't like other aches and pains. Something about it just felt wrong. I didn't think this was a ""walk it off"" kind of deal. My head immediately started running through possible scenarios. Given my mental space at the time, they were mostly worst case scenarios.  
It was incredibly hard to separate my logical thoughts from my overly negative ones. I'd think ""Well I guess I have to go home. I can't just take a break every mile to keep my foot from hurting."" then I'd think ""Wait, yes I can. In fact it'd probably be good for me to take more breaks anyway."" But for every time I caught myself being illogically negative, there were also lots of times where the most negative thoughts genuinely seemed like the most logical. It was a war in my head.
By the time I made it to my lunch spot, I was limping bad. I was planning on taking a siesta there to beat the heat anyway, so I figured if it didn't feel any better after a three hour rest, I'd get it checked out, because while I can rest every mile if I needed to, I can't do it for three hours every time. At the end of the siesta, it felt no better. If anything it felt worse. 
I called my insurance to find an in network hospital nearby. Luckily there was one a mile away. I also called a BnB that offered free shuttles so I would have a place to stay tonight and a free shuttle to the hospital. They did some x-rays there and said they'd get back to me tomorrow. If they can see a fracture in the x-rays, then it's already past the ""rest it"" phase and I'll need to stay off it for 8-10 weeks. If they don't see anything, I'm in the ""take it easy for 2-3 weeks"" phase. I can still hike, but we'd be talking back to 7-9 mile days if I'm lucky. 
Resting in the bnb, my foot has started noticeably swelling. I can't flex my toes without sending shooting pain up my foot. I'm definitely more scared than ever about the future of my hike. I don't think it's over, but for the first time, I worry about finishing. If I have to stay off it for 8-10 weeks, Katahdin might be closed by the time I can even drive up there to attempt going south. 
On the bright side, if I have to go home, I've gotten so much out of this trip. More than I ever could have hoped for. I will definitely be leaving with some disappointments, but I won't be disappointed about the sights I've seen, the people I've met, the effort I put into this, what I was able to accomplish, the experiences I've had... I'm perfectly happy with all of that. Looking at my original list of reasons for doing this hike, the only ones I haven't already completed are the very few that involved finishing the hike. The majority I've already accomplished. 
I know it probably sounds like I've already resigned myself to ending here, but I do plan to keep fighting for as long as it's safe to do so. And when it isn't, it's still not over. If I can't finish the northern half of this trail this year, I'll finish it in sections in the future. The trail will always be a part of my life, and I look forward to experiencing the rest of it.","Stealth camp spot

Today was a day of huge emotional (and physical) ups and downs. Sorry in advance for the length of this one.
Jared, Ian and I started off around 7. The hiking was pretty easy to start. We came across the sign in station and the ranger there asked where we were going. When we explained I'd be going over and continuing on, she mentioned they really don't suggest people go down Hunt trail with their full packs. Unfortunately, we didn't really have a choice at that point, so... Learning lesson for next time I guess?
We went up Saddle trail and things got harder quick. It was non stop rock scramble to the top. Despite the clouds blocking most views, we still got occasional moments of crazy beauty. By the time we got to the top, my thighs were feeling shaky and my knees already hurt.
There was a huge crowd of people waiting to take their picture. I imagined less people would be there on a rainy weekend, but apparently not. We got some sweet pictures, Ian and Jared shared some food with me to give me a little extra to get out of the 100 mile wilderness with, and I started down.
The start was breathtaking. Some of the best views yet. You'd think you'd get tired of them, but Maine really is on another level. So beautiful. Then the scrambles began. It's not nearly as much fun getting down huge boulders as it is getting up. I pretty much felt like I was going to die the whole time. My pack kept trying to drag me down, my poles kept getting in the way, the rocks were like coral and cut my hands as I tried to slow my descent at times. There was just no safe way to get down some areas. My gloves and pack cover now have holes in them from the rocks.
About halfway down, my right knee decided it was done. They had been hurting the whole time, but if I stepped down with my right leg now, there was a sharp and lingering pain I had to wait about 15 seconds to dull before I kept walking, every time. This was causing it to take me forever to make progress. I still had 2.5 miles of steep downhill left. 
After tons of breaks, lots of pain, and lots of questioning why I came back to the trail, it evened out a bit. The last mile passed in about 30 minutes (as opposed to the three hours it had taken for the previous mile). I was originally planning to hike past the campsite, but I was feeling lucky I even got this far, so I definitely stopped.
A ranger intercepted me and asked if I needed a place to stay. When I said yes, he told me I was incredibly lucky. Not only had someone cancelled a reservation for their lean to at the last second today, but another flip flopper rented it and said he'd share it with other hikers who needed a place to stay the night. Not sure what I would have done if there were no openings. Honestly they might have made me keep hiking.
Bagels was the other hiker. He injured his foot in Virginia and had to take time off and was just starting his southbound flip flop, so very similar situations! He also apparently knew the first ranger we had talked to on the other side of Katahdin from college. She met up with him and let him know there'd be another hiker looking for a spot later on, which was why he had initially offered to share the lean to. Lots of very fortunate things happened to get me this shelter!! We shared the shelter, and I got to sleep early and passed right out. I'm writing this at 8:50 Sunday morning, and I'm still in my sleeping bag. Such good sleep. No regrets. Today will be a short day, luckily.

Today was totally flat on the map, so I was expecting to crush some miles. Welp, my body had other ideas. My alarm went off at 5:30. I reached for my phone to turn the alarm off and my arm screamed in pain. I got up to go to the bathroom and it took a solid 15 minutes until I could actually stand up and walk anywhere. I had to stretch just to walk 20 feet. After I peed, I climbed back into bed and figured I'd let my body tell me when it was ready. It chose about 8:30. It still wasn't happy about it though.
I did a ton of stretches, ate a good breakfast then headed out at around 10:15. The terrain was easy, as expected, and my knees felt much better than I was expecting! The unexpected casualties of yesterday were my thighs though. They stopped me from going as fast as I wanted on the flat areas, and hurt so much on the tiny tiny uphill areas, that I slowed to a crawl on them. That mentally hurt a bit, since uphills were always my strong point, and the place I'd usually make up time I lost on my slow downhills. 
In addition, the mosquitos were ridiculously bad. I have been bitten  maybe ten times this whole trip. Today, I'm counting about sixteen bites. I couldn't even watch the trail because I had to keep scanning my arms for the little bastards to get them before they bit. Thank goodness the trail wasn't rocky! I decided I was going to get off at the next road and hitch into town for some bug spray and calamine lotion. It'd be bad to be miserable like this all week in the 100 mile wilderness.
There was a big building on the road without any signs on it that I could see, but it looked to have a bunch of people going in and out, so I figured I'd head in and see if I could use their phone to call a shuttle into town. When I opened the door, I saw it was a restaurant! Furthermore, everyone stared at me when I opened the door. Everyone! Like an old timey saloon when some bad dude walks in. And it wasn't one of those passing ""Who's that? Meh, don't know him"" and look away type of deals. They watched me the whole walk through the place until I got to the bar seating. Even then, some kept looking. It was super weird... I thought maybe it was some sort of private establishment so when I got to the bar and the waitress asked me how I was doing I just kind of stammered and couldn't think of an answer. Then she asked me if I wanted food. That jogged my mind free and I eagerly said yes. It was precisely what I needed at that moment. Cold soda, hot meal, out of the sun and away from the mosquitos.
After the meal, I stopped at the attached store for a bit more food (to allow for an extra day hiking given my slower pace) and bug spray. They didn't have anything to ease the existing bites, but that wasn't worth hitching into town for so I'll deal. Glad this restaurant/shop saved me some hitching!

I woke up incredibly sore, but did a ton of stretching and hit the trail hard! It's crazy how many northbounders I'm seeing. I went from hardly seeing anyone, to passing over a dozen or more a day. I knew I'd be hitting some bubbles on the way back, I just assumed they'd be smaller due to all the drop outs. I'm curious if this year will have a higher success rate than most. There's certainly a lot to get away from in the world right now, and this is a great way to do it.
I ran into Bambi Magnet today! Last time I saw him was in Damascus. He was going Northbound and doing good mileage. About three months later, here he is. It's crazy how fast some people finish this.
Today had tons of roots and rocks. Very hard on the feet and ankles. At lunch Bagels and I met another southbound hiker. He's just starting his hike and ramping up, so we probably won't see a lot of him, but it was cool to see others out here.
I was crazy drained the second half of the day. My muscles weren't tired, I wasn't out of breath, I just had no energy. I kept snacking, hoping that would help, but no dice. I had to stop at the top of Nesuntabunt mountain and stealth camp. I just couldn't do anymore miles today. I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to camp here, but I also don't think I'll run into ridge runners in the hundred mile wilderness. I'll just be sure to be up and out early. Tomorrow I'll probably just do the ten to the hostel and grab some more food. I went through a lot today...
Oh, that's the other thing. There's a hostel in the middle of the hundred mile wilderness! I debated not staying out of principle, but with how much I ate today, all you can eat breakfast sounds amazing.","Hurd Brook Lean To

Sorry for the length. Trying something new: Updating throughout the day to capture my emotional swings better. Sorry specifically to Kevin, who recently mentioned he liked my posts exactly the length they are. My bad buddy. ________________________________________I woke up last night to pee and there wasn't a sound in the entire forest. No insects, no birds, no tree frogs...nothing. It was cool, but also pretty unsettling. Then as I was trying to fall asleep, a pack of wolves started howling. I think that's when it really struck me how isolated I am out here, especially when I camp by myself. Going to try not to do that again. Couldn't sleep after that.________________________________________The trail seems to have lost a lot of luster for me since my break. I'm not sure what it is. I'm in one of the most beautiful sections, the terrain isn't bad here at all (yet), the weather has been perfect and I've already found a hiking buddy...but everything just feels different. I don't have that drive that I did before. I miss Rebecca and my family a ton and I've only been gone for four days. We'll see how it goes through the rest of the 100 mile wilderness, but I don't think I've had a single day yet where I've been excited to hike.________________________________________Met two half AT section hikers at sunrise this morning: Smiles and Picnic. They said the next thirty five miles were beautiful and easy. Here's hoping!________________________________________I almost just walked past the only water source I'm going to get for a while. Close one, because I was completely out!________________________________________Lots of little beaches today! Would swim if I enjoyed water. Instead I'll enjoy soaking my feet and lying on the gravel...which is more comfortable than it sounds.________________________________________I keep getting into the zone and enjoying myself, only to have little ""Don't be happy"" stumbles. Sometimes I'll trip right as I'm content enough to start whistling, sometimes my trekking pole will get stuck on a root right as I find a good stride and make me stop to wriggle it loose. It really pulls me into a negative mindspace real quick.________________________________________The trail isn't bad so far, but much rockier and rootier than Smiles and Picnic made it out to be... Maybe it'll clear up later?________________________________________Staying at a hostel tonight! You call them using a two way radio at a dock and they pick you up in a boat. Pretty pimp. They also serve dinner and all you can eat breakfast. I'm in!________________________________________I'm the only one here. They have cell service, but no WiFi so I can't upload any of these yet. I talked to Rebecca and Grizz on the phone, so that helped my mood. Now I'm chilling in a hammock reading a trashy mystery novel. ""Elizabeth had taken off her coat, revealing a holstered .38 and two holstered 36D's"" So, you know, the good stuff.________________________________________Two other hikers showed up. One is flip flopping and recognized me from the log books. Pretty awesome. The other is finishing his thru hike. Pretty chill dudes. 42 and Turtle. Though from the sounds of it, Turtle hikes pretty fast, so might not see him again.________________________________________I was very much contemplating having Rebecca pick me up from a nearby town. That's how down I felt today. I'll give myself the rest of the hundred mile wilderness to see how I feel though. The thought of another five days feeling like I did the past four is honestly a little terrifying, but I owe it to myself and everyone supporting me to at least see it through another five days!","Nesuntabunt Mountain

I got a lot of sleep last night and woke up feeling great. At the all you can eat breakfast I met a family who was staying at a cabin at the hostel. They were finishing up a section hike and offered me the rest of their bug spray. The bottle I bought was half empty after two days, so I gratefully accepted! After breakfast, the hostel owner offered me some left over blueberry pancakes, which I also gratefully accepted! 
There were no outlets at the hostel, since everything was run on kerosene and generators, but they offered an overnight phone charging. I had used my battery to charge my phone earlier, so I asked if they could charge my battery instead. They said their generator didn't haven't enough output for the batteries and they'd never been able to charge any. I asked if they would mind trying, since mine was usb-c and less power intensive. Come the morning, fully charged! Awesome luck so far.
I was still dreading hiking, but I got all my stuff together and hit the trail. For some reason, today felt different, in a good way! More like the old hiking. Maybe it was the breakfast, maybe the good luck, maybe the pre-bed stretches so I wasn't sore when I woke up, maybe being able to talk to some people. Who knows? I'll try and recreate as many of those as possible in the future though.________________________________________I think I should put more Mario soundtracks on my mp3 player. They always put me in a good mood. As I'm writing this I'm realizing I forgot to put the Super Mario RPG soundtrack on. Idiot!________________________________________I found a perfect lunch spot. A single bench right next to a river. I used the last of my water to cook, ate a delicious meal, refilled my water and left refreshed. I should make it to the shelter by about three thirty today. I wish there was another one a bit further away. I'm definitely feeling up to a bigger day, but not a 22 mile day, which is where the next shelter would be.________________________________________I'm about eleven miles in now and my feet are definitely feeling it. I'm for sure stopping after 14 today. It's pretty disheartening to see how much foot conditioning disappeared after only three weeks. My feet haven't gotten sore this quickly since Georgia. ________________________________________Just ran into Dory! Rebecca and I met her and her husband in Georgia. Apparently he got sick and is taking some time off and she skipped ahead and is going back to finish Virginia and beyond later.________________________________________I worry the permethrin I put in my stuff didn't take. Mosquitos keep landing on my shirt and pants and biting me through them. I see them landing on my bag too. If it works this bad against mosquitos, I worry how it will fare against the ticks.________________________________________My feet hurt SO much. I keep stopping to rest them, but I can only stop so long before the mosquitos eat me. They're attacking my back where I can't accurately fire the bug spray and the permethrin shirt is powerless to stop it.________________________________________Finally at the shelter. Soaking my feet in the swimming hole. I'm going to rest for an hour and a half and see if I'm up for another four miles. It would set up the rest of the wilderness to be 11 mile days, which would be perfect. We'll see though. There are tiny fish in the water trying to clean my feet I think...________________________________________Nope. Staying. Did some math and I should be fine with the food I have. Worst case scenario I'll have to hoof it the final ten miles on snacks. Doable, since snacks are basically my breakfast right now as is.","White House landing hostel

It was super cold when I woke up this morning. Ignored my 5:00 alarm to stay warm in my bag, then begrudgingly woke up at 5:30 and started packing up. After I packed my tent I realized I wasn't the only one hiding from the cold. No one else in camp was even stirring yet.
I ate breakfast and made myself a coffee. Then my stove decided to do a neat thing it's been doing on and off since I got back on the trail: It randomly stops letting fuel in. So I'll be trying to boil water, it will start to heat up, then it will turn itself off. Or just turn itself so far down that is using fuel, but not heating anything. That's even cooler. It only does it with Coleman brand fuel, so if you have an MSR pocket rocket, avoid Coleman fuel! I enjoyed a lukewarm coffee with my breakfast that probably took enough fuel to make that I'll run out before the wilderness is over...
Just as I finished stretching, brushing my teeth and filtering water, a few other people started to move around in their tents. I hit the trail nice and early. ________________________________________Luckily, the cold seemed to be keeping the mosquitos away. Haven't seen any in the first few hours. Also just finished the first uphill. Definitely wasn't as bad as expected. If the rest are like this, I should be good. This was the smallest though, so there's that. And I haven't done the downhill yet, so there's that... But I'm hopeful! And I'm making great time this morning! If I can keep this up, maybe I'll even be able to go one shelter further than planned!________________________________________Just looked at the elevation increases for the climbs later today. The one I destroyed earlier was 760 feet over 1.3 miles. So about 60 feet every tenth of a mile. The one later today is 1300 feet over 1.4 miles...sooo... almost twice the elevation gain in just .1 more miles. Right near the end of the day... But you know, staying positive! Name of the game! We'll see how I feel after lunch.________________________________________My right elbow has been hurting like crazy the past few days. It's probably from all the weight I put on my trekking poles to compensate for my knees. Not great.________________________________________At the shelter I was originally planning on staying at tonight. It's 12:30. But I've done about 12 miles, so I wouldn't feel bad about stopping here, and the next few miles are brutal. Am I feeling like a badass or not? I'll let my feet tell me after I eat and rest.________________________________________BADAAAASSSSSS!!!!!!!!!________________________________________Omigod... Why did I think I was a badass? This sucks. I'm so out of breath. So many stairs. Omigod...________________________________________Another...*huff*... easy summit... It's beautiful up here though! Katahdin is getting smaller and smaller. Soon it will be hard to believe it kicked my ass so hard.________________________________________I made it! My biggest miles since being back on trail, on the hardest section of Wilderness yet. I'm actually pretty proud of myself today. I'm definitely feeling back to my old self. I'm enjoying hiking again, which is awesome. I attribute it to my amazing wife, who told me exactly what I needed to hear to get my head back in the game.

I didn't sleep at all last night. Not sure why after so many miles, I just couldn't find a comfortable position. I was kind of slanted ground and kept sliding, so that might have had something to do with it. Then this morning was another cold one, so it took me a while to get out of bed. It doesn't matter as much today, since I'm only planning on doing 10 miles. Should be nice to call an early day.
I met an interesting hiker in her late fifties named Hobo. She finished the AT in '09, did the Long Trail and the CDT and tried to do the PCT this year, but had to stop after 720 miles due to the snow melts causing the river fords to be too dangerous. Now she's section hiking the 100 mile wilderness with her friend.
Side note: The hundred mile wilderness is way less wild than advertised. I've met a ton of section hikers who got dropped off at random sections via private roads and are getting picked up at some other random road. Not only does it kind of kill the vibe, but it also means the shelters and tent sites have been super full by the time the thru hikers get to camp, since the section hikers often do 6-8 miles and stop at around 2-3. On the one hand, I'm happy they're getting to experience this, because it's awesome. On the other hand, it makes it really hard for the thru hikers to get good rest, as they're often forced to stealth camp on uneven ground, then put in another big mile day to finish before they run out of food, since they don't have anyone picking them up at these private roads or bringing food. I dunno. I know we're not entitled to anything, it just always seemed that this would be the one area we didn't have to fight day hikers for sleeping space.________________________________________Another super rooty day, which means lots of stumbling and getting my trekking poles stuck. It's not bothering me AS much today...but it's still super fucking annoying...________________________________________I just forded my first actual river! All the times it said I'd have to ford in the book, there were rocks you could hop across instead. This is the first one I actually had to take my shoes off and wade across. I'm an outdoorsman now!________________________________________Looks like rain. I'm hoping it'll wait until I get to the shelter. I heard the climb there is perilous enough, without having to worry about the rocks being slick.________________________________________""Nope. Fuck you specifically, John."" Damnit nature. Why you be like dis.________________________________________Made it to the shelter. Definitely staying here. It's supposed to rain all night and into the morning. Hard pass. I'm two days away from the end of the wilderness regardless of whether I do big or small miles, so might as well take it easy!________________________________________Holy crap it's cold. I got to the shelter at one and around six decided I was too cold to cook dinner, so I had a Snickers, an apple pie and some dried mango in my sleeping bag. The sun hasn't even technically gone down yet and we're all here huddled and in our puffy coats and sleeping bags.","Carl A Newhall Lean-To

Welp, the rats got into everyone's stuff last night. We didn't bear bag since we're pretty high up on a mountain, the shelter was full, and it was pouring all night, so we weren't particularly afraid of a bear coming to the shelter to steal food. I did still hang my bag to protect it from the mice. I woke up in the middle of the night to a chewing sound from my hanging bag. I went over and smacked it and a big rat ran out. Luckily they only chewed a hole in my snack bag and only got to about half my mangoes. Still though...mangoes! :( Someone had their sleeping bag ripped into. There was down everywhere! Several others were missing food or had holes in their bags. No bueno.________________________________________Lost the trail again for a little bit today. Super frustrating. Went about half a mile down a slippery rocky downhill, then had to backtrack back up it. Nothing kills momentum and the mood like that shit.________________________________________Kind of a bummer of a day. Not raining currently, so that's nice, but the whole hike so far has been in a cloud. I've climbed two mountains so far that are supposed to have great views, and just fog. The rocks to get up here are also super slippery from last night. I've almost eaten it several times on pretty steep drops. ________________________________________Ok, this time I just sat at the top of the mountain for like 45 minutes waiting for the clouds to shift just right so I could see something. Success! -ish.________________________________________Just stopped at another foggy viewpoint for lunch. Man, the slippery rocks and roots are really killing my speed. I'm rocking slower than 1.5 mph. And even at that I keep almost falling. Frustrating.________________________________________So after lunch I started trucking much faster. I feel like maybe my dinner of a Snickers and apple pie last night had something to do with the lack of energy today... Evidence inconclusive! Should hit camp by six, then tomorrow it will be a 15 mile day out of the wilderness! Finally!________________________________________I just sat down and took a long look at what might be my last good view of the AT. It was a little surreal.________________________________________A squirrel just jumped to a log near me and gave me one of those ""come at me, bro"" fake pumps. I did one back at him and he backed up a step, then came back at me with another one. We did this back and forth for about a minute before he ran away.________________________________________My final camping spot of the AT is a stealth spot right next to a beautiful river, with a perfect bear bag tree nearby and totally flat ground.

I slept so well last night! Hardly woke up at all. (Granted I took some Tylenol PM, but still!) Ate on a rock in the river and hit the trail by seven. I realized this morning that I accidentally threw away the page in my guidebook that had all the info about Monson, so I found a thru hiker packing up camp this morning and got a picture of that page from their book so I can call a hostel after all this.________________________________________I just had my first legitimately terrifying fall. I was hiking on a ledge and I looked over the side and thought ""Man, I hope I don't fall here."" And literally as I thought it, me feet went out from under me. Not in a one-foot-at-a-time way that I'm used to and can stop with my trekking poles, but in a cartoon-character-slipping-on-a-banana-peel type of way. My back (luckily covered by my pack) hit the ground hard and I started slipping down the steep slope. I still had my trekking poles in my hand and managed to catch a small tree with my left one. I slid for a bit more (pulling my shoulder uncomfortably far back) until the snow basket on my trekking pole stuck on the tree, my momentum stopped and I was able to use the tree to climb back onto the trail. Other than some soreness in my shoulder, I'm not hurt, but man am I shaken up. (Lightweight, if you're reading this, that snow basket you always mocked may have saved my life!)________________________________________The pain in my left shoulder means I need to compensate by putting more weight on my right trekking pole, which of course means my sore right elbow is getting much more sore. Some days you can't win...________________________________________After some painkillers, things are going alright. There were some nice ridgewalks and some great ponds today. Only three miles left until Monson and a hostel and shower and laundry and mmmmmm.________________________________________And that's a wrap! Heading home tomorrow. Explanation post coming soon. In the meantime, staying at the Lakeshore Hostel. It's pretty awesome here. There's a restaurant downstairs, guests can take out the kayaks for free, they have loaner laptops for guests... Pretty fancy stuff. At the restaurant now. I asked them what drinks they made with banana rum. She didn't know, so she started mixing a bunch of things together and giving me samples of everything. I feel like by the time I settled on a drink I was already hammered. Just realized I didn't get carded. Not sure if a Maine thing, or whether I just finally look my age with short hair.","Stealth camp spot

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576124,"This is a difficult entry to write, not just because it's impossible to not feel like I let some people down, but also because it's very difficult to find the right words for all of my feelings currently. Long story short: I've decided to end my thru-hike. Not due to injury or anything, just because I think it's time for me to get off the trail. Long story long:There's some trail knowledge that says, if you ever want to quit, give it another two days before you make any decisions. If you still want to quit after those three days, you should do it. I always thought that was too quick to make such a big decision, so I told myself I couldn't quit unless I woke up seven days in a row thinking ""I don't want to be here."" I started that seven day countdown a few times over the course of my hike, but never made it past a few days. When I went to Maine after my break, the whole hike felt different for me. The views were just as breathtaking, the conversations with people were just as engaging, but there were several things missing. Suddenly, I wasn't enjoying the hiking anymore. Going north, I was in a constant state of either happy or neutral while hiking, which is good, since you're doing it for 11-12 hours a day! Since flip flopping, I was in a pretty steady state of unhappiness while hiking. Honestly, I'm still not sure exactly why. I have a lot of theories, but the bottom line was, I was unhappy most of the time, with occasional moments of happiness when there would be a good view or I'd meet someone new. The days dragged on and my positivity (which is really important to have, since it helps you break through the pain, loneliness and repetition of each day) waned rapidly every day. This was the most beautiful part of the trail I've done by far, and the weather was gorgeous much of the time and the terrain wasn't too difficult...yet none of that was making me happy. About halfway through I got signal and called Rebecca and Grizz, and it really helped talking to them, but only very temporarily. Every morning I still woke up asking myself why I was out here. I think it was especially hard given that I had just come back from three weeks at home resting my foot. I got a chance to see my wife, my family, and my friends, only to have to leave them all again. There's another piece of trail wisdom that says you should have a list of things you want to do when you get off the trail, so you can keep busy and don't succumb to post-trail depression, which is a serious issue. I had that list ready, and when I had to get off for three weeks, I started some of those things. In retrospect, that was probably a mistake. I thought it would help me keep my mind off the injury and stay focused on something, but it only made it harder. Not only was I leaving a lot of people I loved when I got back on the trail, but I was also now leaving a bunch of projects I was really excited about, and had just started up. I'm sure that contributed to my feelings of unhappiness while I was out there. There's lots of other things I can think of that probably contributed to this, but the bottom line is that after seven days of waking up and not wanting to be here, I decided I was wasting my time. If I can't enjoy the freedom and beauty of one of the most breathtaking states on the trail, what am I doing out here? It costs a lot to be here. Not just the money I spend there, but the money that's being spent on bills while I'm here, the time I'm spending away from loved ones, the momentum I'm losing on career growth...it's a pricey trip, and if I'm unhappy all the time, the cost just isn't worth it.  Maybe I could have pushed myself to the finish, fueled just on pride and an aversion to having to write a post like this...but that's not how I wanted to finish this hike. There are signs everyone on the trail that say ""Don't just finish, finish well."" They're mostly in reference to not being a douchebag in Baxter and following LNT principles, but I really felt like it applied to me too. I don't want to finish if it means dragging myself through some of our nations most beautiful sights, kicking and screaming and miserable. All this being said, I absolutely plan to continue hiking, just as a section hiker. I want to see the rest of Maine and New Hampshire and Vermont, but I think I'll appreciate it much more in smaller chunks, maybe even hiking with friends. There's still a lot of beauty to see out there, and I don't want to miss it. Thank you all for supporting me this whole time, and I am sorry to any of you who I've disappointed by quitting. I've enjoyed sharing my journey with you, and I hope you enjoyed being a part of it.","

Swift Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579394,"I've been off the trail for a little over a month now. There's a lot of advice people give for when you get off the trail, to avoid succumbing to Post-Trail Depression. Stay active. Have goals for when you get off the trail. Keep in touch with trail friends so you have people to talk to, because your friends, even if they really want to, won't be able to relate or understand what you went through. It's all good advice. I wish I were following more of it...Still haven't gotten around to getting the gym membership. I think I've been putting it off for two reasons:1. I started the trail as a size 32 waist. I left the trail as a size 28. I knew I'd be gaining some weight back, so I bought all new pants in a size 30. I haven't gained any of the weight back yet. I was kind of hoping to grow into some of my new clothes before I start getting fit again.2. Laziness. Mostly laziness. I have been job hunting, though I haven't had much success yet. It's hard to keep in perspective that a month and a half isn't a long time to be unemployed, but it feels like an eternity. I've always been a worker, and not having a job just feels weird. It didn't bother me on the trail, because I never felt unemployed on the trail. My employer was Nature, and my job duty was to adventure. Now though...now I'm definitely unemployed. I can't play the ""adventurer"" card now unless I start leaving the house more often.  I have kept in touch with several trail friends, though not as much as I'd like. It helps having Rebecca to talk to, since she experienced so much of it with me, and came to visit so often and got to hear our stories even after she got off the trail. I got a chance to meet up with Lightweight and Tiger as they came through Connecticut on their way to Maine. That was pretty awesome. One thing I have decided, is that I'm going to write a book during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). It will be about lessons I learned on the trail and how they could be applied to everyday life. The goal is for it to be more of a comical read, while still being useful for people who want to avoid the mistakes I made. If you've enjoyed the tone of my journal, the book will likely be similar...but hopefully better, since I'll be planning and proofreading as opposed to just typing something up on my phone before I go to sleep and posting it. The working title is ""Appalachian Fail: Lessons learned from a failed thru-hike"". This will be my first time attempting something like this, so we'll see how it goes. I'll probably be posting excerpts on here as I finish them. Wish me luck!",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Wed",0
