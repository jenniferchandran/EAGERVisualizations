RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535742,"I guess this is my first official entry for my 2017 journal. I was part of the class of 2016 but took a fall that caused me to end my trip not long after I started it. You could say I had a premature evacuation. I had planned to be back on the trail by now but life has gotten in the way so I have decided to delay my trip and join the hikers hitting the trail in the spring of 2017. I am sure I will be in great company then as I was this past spring.On the up side I already have all of my gear and the urge is strong to just saddle up and start walking again. But duty calls and things need attending to before I hit the trail again. I look forward to getting to know my fellow hikers that are starting out next year. I know it seems like a long way off but trust me it will be here before you know it. My 2016 journal is available for anyone that is interested. I enjoy writing so I tend to post in my journal often and welcome all feedback, comments and questions.Take care and enjoy the preparation phase of the hike. It is all part of the adventure!",,Hello Class of 2017,"May 30, Mon",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536102,"One of the few good things of having to leave the trail to recover from my injury is being able to make it to important family events this year. On the way to East Texas to attend my granddaughter's high school graduation, my wife and I decided to stop for the night at a small town just off of the Interstate. I had passed the exit many times over the years but had never stopped. On the way back to the motel after having dinner we came across an old cemetery and decided to stop for a bit and walk around. It was obviously very old and the beautiful carved headstones caught my eye. I took quite a few pictures but the headstone in the picture really spoke to me. It is the grave of a 9 year old child buried in 1885 and as you can see there is a tree growing out of the grave. It seemed to really make the point that we are only on this earth for a short time and no matter how immortal we think we are or how ""timeless"" we think our monuments are, in the end nature will always have it's way and absorb us and our efforts. I was also reminded of this poem by Tom Splitt:The calm quiet strength of a tree Anchored deep in the earth Reaching high in the sky The calm quiet strength of a treeThe calm quiet strength of a tree Full of life from its roots To the tiniest branch The calm quiet strength of a treeAnd oh, how it comforts me How it teaches me Without a sound Then I realize at once That this tree and I are one In eternityThe calm quiet strength of a tree From the weight of its trunk To its delicate leaves The calm quiet strength of a treeThe calm quiet strength of a tree Showing anyone near All the secrets of time The calm quiet strength of a tree",,Nature Is Timeless,"Jun 01, Wed",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536147,"I stepped outside my home office to get a bit of fresh air and re-focus my eyes on something other than a computer screen. I found a young bird testing his wings out and trying to get the hang of flying. He had no fear of me at all and was content to keep me company while he rested a bit. Every time I spend time in nature I always come back wondering why the majority of us choose to keep ourselves cooped up inside boxes for most of our lives. We live in an environment that insulates us from the real world and all the wonders of nature. This is progress? Seems that a lot of the problems we are dealing with could be helped by man taking a step back and spending more of his life outside in the sun and fresh air. When you are the only living thing inside of a cage you tend to focus on yourself rather than realizing that you are just a small part of a huge world and only one animal among millions. Nature tends to remind us of our place in the grand scheme of things when we start thinking we are the center of the universe. We all must do what we must to make a living. There is no getting around that. We just have to make sure that we do not confuse making a living with actually living. The best way I know to keep things in perspective is to get out and go for a walk. When I get antsy and start feeling discontented I know it is time for a walk about. I always come back refreshed and feeling creative.So until you can hit the trail, walk where you can when you can and let Mother Nature soothe your soul. Take care and happy walking!",,June Beginnings,"Jun 01, Wed",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536227,"As a kid I learned the old rhyme ""April shows bring May flowers"". Well last night's June showers brought a toad that emerged from somewhere below the West Texas sun baked land. Not as poetic but still pretty cool and a great example of the heartiness of the animals that live out in this tough country. They dig in and bury themselves when it gets dry and emerge when the rain comes again. They have adapted and not only survive this arid land, but judging from looking at this portly little guy, they thrive. A good lesson to remember from Nature. If we adapt to our circumstances, we can survive and end up stronger and better off than before. Either that or maybe we end up looking like a miniature watermelon like Mr. Toad in the picture. I am hoping for the former myself though sometimes I tend to ease toward the latter at times. Another day closer to being back on the trail. Take care.",,June Showers Bring......

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550982,Well it has been a while since I posted here so thought I would bring everyone up to date. My ankle seems to be doing well. I am logging 3 to 4 miles every morning with a 30 pound ruck and no ankle brace. My son and I made a run up to Southern Colorado and spent a few days backpacking just off the Continental Divide Trail. Had a blast and I can't wait to have another go at the Appalachian Trail this coming spring. I pretty much already have all of my gear and it has been thoroughly tested so now it is just a waiting game. I did add one piece of gear and tested it on the Colorado trip. I am a hammock hanger and I never liked leaving my pack sitting on the ground at night. If I hung it on my straps it seemed to change the hanging feel of the hammock so I settled for a bit of ground cloth and left it on the ground. I recently picked up a gear hammock/swing from Trek Light Gear. It is called the VersaTrek and only weighs 8 ounces. It can support up to 400 lbs so you can also use it as a seat/swing and I do during rest breaks. At night I hook it to the dangling ends of my Atlas hammock straps and it hangs above me under the tarp. I unpack my pack into it so I can access anything I need and my empty pack hangs by carabiner on my hammock strap. If I take a break during the day I just loop my straps between two points and hook the VersaTrek on them and sit down. I have even stretched out in it and napped. I posted a link in my gear list for it. I appreciate the encouraging emails and posts in my guest book. I did get a couple of strange emails and a weird guest book post from a guy who seems pissed that I left the trail. Don't know if anyone else has received anything from him. Oh well. It takes all kind I guess. If I can help anyone or answer any questions feel free to hit me up. Take care and I will see you down the trail.,,High Country Trip,"Oct 27, Thu",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551128,"Today while I was out on my morning hike I was pondering the subject of titles and trophies and what they actually mean. Over the years I have acquired my share of plaques and awards for different things and earned multiple certifications and titles. I am sure at the time they meant a lot to me but looking back on them now they don’t really seem that important. Sitting here at my desk I can see one of them sitting on a shelf collecting dust. I received it for 14 years of service with a major oil company. That was 14 years of very long hours and being strapped with a pager and cell phone and on call 24 hours a day. Don’t get me wrong, it was a great paying job and I had the opportunity to work with some outstanding people and I am grateful for it. But that plaque represents long hours away from my family, handling projects which in the end meant nothing at all. That facility is now shut down and is being dismantled and shipped overseas. Everything I designed and built during those 14 years will soon be gone and forgotten. All that will be left of mine and many others efforts is a bare patch of ground. It doesn’t seem like a very good trade in hindsight.I guess the point of my ramblings is that we need to enjoy the journey and not lose sight of life’s pleasures along the way. It is all well and good to have goals to keep us on track but if we become focused solely on earning a title, acquiring another trophy, knocking out the miles or summiting that peak, we will miss so much along the way. I can relate to the old saying” I wish I knew then what I know now”. Once it is in our rear view mirror it is too late to do anything about it. Looking back on it now, I would have missed a lot less school functions and ball games and went on a lot more camping and fishing trips with the boys.It is strange how my line of thought came around to this. My morning hikes are a great time for thinking. While I was walking I was thinking about the guy that trolls this forum and left me strange comments in my guest book and email. He was bent out of shape that I considered myself a Thru-Hiker even though I don’t remember ever referring to myself as such. He seemed obsessed with the title itself and said that I should call myself a Section Hiker at best and he was sure that I “would fail again this year”. His bizarre ramblings got me thinking about the definition of success and failure and how we define it. Any time that I get to spend outside is a win to me and I don’t really care what title someone wants to hang on me. Maybe I could be called an Aspiring Thru-Hiker. But even that sounds a bit too focused on the end goal for me. I think the term Potential Thu-Hiker may be more accurate. That means I have accumulated the funds, set aside the time, gathered the gear and basically got my poop in a group to walk from Georgia to Maine. I think I like that! I have Potential! I might be a contender! The other subject that I kicked around this morning was the definition of failure. If you consider yourself a failure unless you reach the top Mount Katahdin then you might want to consider that you might be overly focused on the goal to the detriment of the journey itself. I was definitely disappointed that I had to leave the trail due to injury last spring but the thought that I had failed never entered my mind. Life happens! My personal belief is that it happens for a reason. Because I was off the trail I got to watch my daughter be awarded her Masters in Nursing and become certified as a Nurse Practitioner after years of taking classes while working as a RN and being a wife and mother. I also got to see my oldest granddaughter graduate High School. That was definitely not a failure in my book. Sure I would have loved to be still on the trail but I loved being able to be part of important moments for my daughter and granddaughter. I remember passing a mother and adult daughter on my first day on the trail. They were obviously overloaded and out of shape and were struggling. A volunteer ranger told me that evening that he had talked to them and they were headed off the trail the next morning. I am sure they were disappointed but that mother and daughter got to share hours together dreaming, planning and time together in the woods. They shared an adventure all be it a short one. They might be trying again this year or they might not. Either way that doesn’t sound like a fail to me. This spring I plan on going for a walk in the woods for however long it feels right, whether it be for a week, a month or half a year. I am thankful that I have the luxury of time and finances to do so. I plan to enjoy each day to the fullest and I look forward to meeting all of my future friends along the way. How can anyone describe spending time in the woods with interesting people for however long life allows a fail? Anyway that is how it looks from the backside of my 60 year old eyes. I look forward to sharing time with all you Potential Thru-Hikers in 2017. Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,"Titles, Awards and Trophies","Nov 02, Wed",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551167,"I don't spend a lot of time discussing gear here because I pretty much have mine worked out. I have been using my final gear picks for the past year and have figured out what works for me and what doesn't. I have posted the main items that have worked well for me on this forum for anyone that is interested. I recently received an email asking why I chose a hammock over a tent so I thought I would answer the question here in case someone else is in the decision making stage. I have been a ground dweller for most of my life and have several tents I like a lot. In addition to hiking, I do a lot of canoeing and for making camp on a sand or gravel bar then a tent is the way to go. If I were hiking the PCT I would probably go with a tent for at least the first 500 miles because of the desert environment. Since the Appalachian Trail has an abundance of trees I decided to try a hammock out last year. After using one for the past year I have to say that I will probably not go back to a tent unless I have to. I sleep much better in a hammock and my back doesn't hurt in the morning from sleeping on the hard ground. I like the fact that I do not have to worry about finding a flat piece of ground to pitch a tent on. All I need are two points 15 to 18 feet apart to string my tarp and hammock between. The two points do not have to be trees. In the photo you see me stretched out in my small gear hammock which is strung between a fence post and power pole. With a bit of imagination you can find two points pretty much anywhere. On my Colorado trip I used the stump of a lightening struck tree and another live tree. The slope of the ground does not matter either since you are suspended above it. Just make sure you remember that you are hanging above steeply sloped ground if you have to get up to pee in the middle of the night. Nothing ruins a good nights sleep like having an out of control runaway down a steep hill, on a cold dark night with a full bladder. There is a great sense of freedom knowing that if I get tired of walking for the day I can just walk off the trail a bit and string up tarp, hang my hammock and camp is made. I don't have to worry about making it to the next shelter or designated campsite. In my mind that increases my options and removes the pressure of having to make a certain number of miles in order to camp. For warmth I use a down under-quilt that attaches to the bottom side of my hammock. I have another down quilt in the hammock with me to cover up with. This system, combined with a good tarp, has kept me toasty in the low 20's and high winds. Another side benefit is that since myself and my gear are off the ground, if it rains the only wet gear I have to deal with in the morning is the tarp. That is not a problem because I always carry it in a mesh sleeve on the outside of my pack so it can dry. So in a nut shell that is why I use a hammock system these days. Home is pretty much wherever I want to hang out... literally! If anyone has specific questions about my gear or anything else, feel free to send me an email. I will do my best to help if I can. Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,Home Is Where You Hang It,"Nov 03, Thu",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551393,"Since I don't have much new to post in the way of preps and training, I thought I would post this story that I wrote in the style and tradition of the storytellers of the Native Americans of the northwest tribes. It was written for my wife but since it goes along with my trail name, I thought I would post it here again:This is a story of long ago in the time after Raven pried open the giant clam shell and allowed The People to emerge into the world. It was in the time after Raven hung the Sun, the Moon and all of the stars in the heavens so The People would have light in their dark world. Raven loved The People and watched them go about their lives as she soared high above them in the sky. Through many seasons Raven flew in the four directions as far as she could and explored the lands of the world. Though Raven loved The People, she longed for another that she could share her life and adventures with. One day as she sat in the top of a tall pine tree and looked out over the ocean, she wondered what was on the other side of the water. Even though she had flown over all of the land, she had never tried to fly over the water to see what was on the other side. “It is time” she thought to herself one day. So Raven spread her giant black wings and soared out over the ocean to see what she could find. She flew for days and grew very tired because she could find no place to land and rest. With each passing day she grew weaker and more weary. Finally she saw something far below her. It was not land but it looked like a log floating in the water. She had to rest so she swooped down and landed on the large black log among the waves of the ocean. She was so tired that she started to doze in the hot sun. Suddenly she heard a voice that seemed to come from the log. “Who are you?” asked the booming voice.“I am Raven” she said. “I am the one The People call The Bringer of the Light”. “Who is talking” she asked loudly!Just then she saw a huge eye open in the log and look at her.“I am Whale” said the log. “I am called The Traveler by The People. I swim in all of the waters of the world and pass by the lodges of The People every season while hunting”.“You must see many wondrous things as you swim across the oceans and dive under the waters” Raven said.“As do you as you fly over the land” Whale replied. “Why are you on my back”? “I longed to see what was on the other side of the water” Raven answered. “I grew so tired and was afraid I would not make it until I saw you and stopped to rest on your back for a while”. “I have always wondered what there was to see upon the land beyond the shore” said Whale.So Raven and Whale stayed together for days sharing with each other all of the wonders they had both seen. Soon a storm appeared with ferocious winds that washed huge waves over the back of Whale. Raven struggled to stay on his back but was almost washed off many times. “If you stay on top of my back you will die” Whale said. “I will open my mouth and you can fly inside of my belly and be safe from the storm.” So that is exactly what Raven did! She flew inside of Whale and snuggled up to his enormous heart and was safe and warm. Days turned to weeks and weeks turned into years as Raven and Whale explored the world together. With each passing day they became closer and closer and grew to love each other very much. They traveled over the waters and lands of the world. They grew so close that Raven could see the beautiful sights under the oceans through Whale’s eyes and Whale could feel and see what Raven felt and saw as she soared through the sky over the land. Time passed and the two grew so close that The People came to think of them as one. They started to tell stories about how Raven and Whale bonded together and became RavenWhale. They made carvings and paintings showing Whale with Raven tucked safely inside his belly next to his heart. That is the story of how love bound together two completely different beings and the result was the creation of something even more beautiful and wondrous. Some believe that RavenWhale is still exploring the world even today.",,The Story of RavenWhale,"Nov 12, Sat",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551921,"I will start this post off with a question: “When is a circle not a circle?” I know it is a strange way to start a journal post but hang with me and I will give you the answer at the end.Well its official! Fall is definitely over here in West Texas. The last of the Black Buzzards circled up today and headed south for the winter. I am always sad to see them go at this time of the year. They are constant companions when I am out hiking and I enjoy watching them soar over the land for hours without ever flapping their wings. When you are looking directly up at them it appears that they are just circling over the same area over and over again, but this is just a matter of perspective. If you are able to watch them from the vantage point of the top of a mesa you will see that they are actually gaining altitude each time they come back around. With each pass over the mountain slopes they gain lift from the thermals there and rise a bit with each circuit they make until they reach the altitude they want. When that happens, off they glide effortlessly over the landscape toward the horizon without ever once flapping their wings.While watching them fly, it occurred to me that in life we often circle back over the same territory and sometimes re-visit the same things over and over again. This is often true of relationships, jobs, choice of friends, etc. It could be that we get stuck in a rut and are just doing so out of habit and familiarity. There is definitely comfort in routine even if it is unhealthy and unfulfilling. Maybe we prefer the safety and security of the known, no matter what it is, to facing the unknown future.But maybe that is not the reason we do so at all. It could be that there is something yet unfinished that makes us circle back repeatedly. Possibly there is a lesson that we still need to learn that will serve us well in the next phase of our lives or some needed experience and maturity to be gained. Just like the buzzards that circle back over the mountain slopes again and again to gain altitude, we come back to a thing repeatedly because there is still something to be learned or gained by doing so. If that is true, then we are not merely circling aimlessly because we are in a rut but are actually acquiring a little more of what we need with each pass. Just like the buzzards, we come back however many times we need to in order to learn the lesson, acquire the knowledge and gain the altitude we need in order to be able to soar away into the new territory of the future. I first ran across this concept when I read the book Crazy Free by Melissa Wyld and she explores it much more deeply than I can ever hope to. It didn’t really hit home with me until I sat on top of the mesa, sipping coffee and watching the buzzards glide by.It seems that life has had me circling back to the Appalachian Trail repeatedly in many different forms throughout my life. First as a young Marine stationed in North Carolina. Then in articles and books that happened across my path throughout my life. It resurfaced repeatedly and tended to occupy my thoughts and dreams as something I might do “One of these days” as I raised my family and earned a living. I had thought that last year was going to be the year for my hike now that I finally had the time and means to do so. But it did not turn out as expected. Apparently I still needed to learn something and gain a bit more altitude before soaring away northward up the trail. So here I am circling back once again with plans to be in Georgia on March 1st. People ask me why I am set on hiking the Appalachian Trail since I regularly hike other trails, float rivers and sail. I don’t really know. For some reason I just keep getting pulled back so I guess there is something waiting for me on the trail. Maybe a friend I haven’t met yet or a lesson I need to learn. I look forward to finding out next spring.Now to the answer of the question that I posed at the beginning of these ramblings: “When is a circle not a circle?” Answer: “When it is an upward spiral.”Anyone that followed my 2016 journal knows that I tend to not be a conventional journal poster. That is one of the hazards of being a writer I guess. I write what comes to me, believing that there is a reason it does so and that it will speak to someone that needs it at the time. I look forward to seeing everyone on the trail as we attempt to soar northward this spring. Take care and I will see you down the trail.",,When Is A Circle Not A Circle?,"Nov 28, Mon",0
RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553016,"Happy New Year everyone! Not much new to report since I did all my preparations last year so now it is just a waiting game. I have had to push my start date back to the latter part of March instead of the 1st due to projects that will not be finished until then. Hopefully I can keep on schedule. Either way at some point in the spring I will hit the trail. I continue to hike every chance I get and continue to try to strengthen my old ankle. Hope everyone is off to a running start this year.

RavenWhale,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553128,"Since the guest book doesn't allow direct responses to individuals, I thought I would answer a couple of questions that I received there and by email.1. What is my pack weight?Last year it weighed in at 33 pounds with food minus the water. This year I should have it down to less than 30 pounds.2. What am I doing to help my injured ankle?Lots of hiking to strengthen it. My daughter is a personal trainer and she has me on some natural supplements that seem to help. Paying attention to how I walk and focusing on not toeing out or pushing off. Slow and easy will be the pace this year.That takes care of the questions part. The painting in the photo is one that I completed for my wife for Christmas to go with the Story of the RavenWhale I wrote for her earlier in the year. It is a new style of painting for me.And lastly I thought I would include a Native American prayer by the Pueblo tribe that has always been a favorite of mine. Take care and I will see you on the trail.~~~~Hold on to what is good,Even if it's a handful of earth.Hold on to what you believe,Even if it's a tree that stands by itself.Hold on to what you must do,Even if it's a long way from here.Hold on to your life,Even if it's easier to let go.Hold on to my hand,Even if someday I'll be gone away from you.",,"Some Answers, A Painting & A Prayer","Jan 09, Mon",0
