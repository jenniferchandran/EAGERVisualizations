We still hung around the campfire for a while to hear stories from professional hiker Concrete (so named because, after hiking a 70 mile day on the Florida trail, he fall flat asleep on the concrete sidewalk outside a ranger station). He had lots of great advice for us first time thru-hikers, like how the first two weeks of any long hike will be the hardest part in terms of adjusting, which was nice to hear because we're certainly feeling it!

We've received quite a few blister tips over the past week from fellow hikers and local community members, such as:-For prevention, remove boots at every opportunity to allow feet to dry, even if it's only a few minutes.-Don't soak existing blister in Epsom salts, it will over dry the skin and inclrease the likelihood of cracking, soak in providone iodine solution instead.-To drain a blister, instead of just lancing with a needle, attach a thread and pull through blister to prevent healing over which will trap moisture (thread will wick moisture as well but make sure to use sterilized materials) - we haven't tried this one yet.-Be careful when wrapping feet with athletic tape, with the excessive sweating and moisture of extended hikes the adhesive can pull at skin causing small blisters on otherwise unproblematic areas (has happened to both Kevin and Brittany this week).We'll post any updates but for now just hoping taking it easing will help us heal and looking forward to tough feet!","Blue Mountain Shelter

After only a few miles on trail this morning we stopped into Bears Den Hostel, just off the trail, and were offered to slack-pack the rest of the roller coaster by a past thru-hiker. We were super excited as it is a very difficult and frustrating section of trail, with constant, steep, ascents and descents, covered in small, unstable rocks. Unfortunately, after waiting some time for the would-be trail angel, he realized he would not be able to slack-pack us after all, so we headed back out, disappointed and behind schedule.

Our first thought was to try to find somewhere to camp or cheap lodging around town. No dice, no camping anywhere around town (without walking back to the trail - so far away!) and the cheapest lodging a $100+ per night B&B. Bleh.

Brittany's initial decision, was to continue on and attempt to summit Katahdin for both of us, and to complete this journey as was always intended. After discussing this decision with her family, however, it became clear that hiking on alone would bring an undue amount of stress and fear into their lives, along with some lack of the satisfaction that would otherwise be had by finishing the trail, as it was started, together. Therefore, though we have 'ended' our hike for this year, we are not done with the Appalachian Trail by a long shot. As soon as Kevin's knee is fit to undertake the extreme stress that is thru-hiking, and the weather permits, of course, we'll be back at it, making our way to Katahdin one step at a time. 


Note:
For the entire 4 months and 5 days I walked the Appalachian Trail, I felt it had to be the hardest thing I would ever do. (And as I haven't finished it yet, the jury's still out on whether it will be!). But I was shocked to find, that what was even harder than hiking the AT, was leaving it. Having my entire life, every day, revolve around dragging myself up, to hike umpteen miles towards this shining prize that is the final summit of Mt. Katahdin; to say it changed my perspective on things would be a gross understatement. I grew accustomed to life at 3 mph, and with that all of the joys and woes and pressures of being a 'thru-hiker'. And while I did my best to appreciate the hiking as much as I knew I would the hike itself, I can't say I didn't let the goal get in the way of the journey on some days. That, if nothing else, helped me decided that finishing the AT with the person I began it with, and the sanity of my worried family were not worth sacrificing for my fixation on being a ""True Thru-Hiker"" and that, when I am able to reach Katahdin, by way of every AT mile I have yet to walk, I will be able to appreciate this odyssey for every bit of heartbreak it has brought me alongside every triumph.

We arrived just after 2, with plenty of time, for canoeing (we passed on swimming as it was pretty brisk around the pond) and put our feet up while we had the opportunity. Not too long after thru hikers Cave Man and Bear Chaser rolled in inquiring about a pancake breakfast! (We had heard rumors but were unwilling to get our hopes too high. But no need, there was one!) Other hikers tricked in throughout the afternoon and we met another thru hiker named HoneyBear and a section hiker calling himself a LASH-er (Long A** Section Hiker) as he hikes a few hundred miles each year to piece together his 2000 miles.

We have heard from several hostels and guides leading up to here that the town of Hanover is exorbitantly overpriced accommodation-wise and there are not many camping/shelter options for those needing to resupply and do any housekeeping chores in town. Luckily, the residents of Hanover know this and have formed a group of trail angels, led by Betsy&Bill whose son thru-hiked in 2007, and allow hikers to stay with them or camp in their yards while in town. We got in touch with Betsy yesterday to inquire as to how this worked, and she told us to come right to her home where we could shower, do laundry and spend the night! When we arrived we met hikers BamaDog and Osprey G already cleaned up and relaxing, and were soon after greeted by Betsy and Bill who had banana bread and watermelon out for any passing hikers to enjoy. We were given the run down on house rules and then left to shower and make ourselves at home.

Lake of the Clouds Hut is the only hut with separate accommodations for thru-hikers besides work-for-stay and this space is called the dungeon. It is technically an emergency shelter below the Hut, but has six bunks that hikers can utilize for $10, what a bargain! The trail from Mitzpah to LOC is mostly smooth, only summiting Mt. Pierce and then skirting the summits of the remaining presidential peaks leading up to Mt. Washington...normally. Seemingly unlucky for us, the last stretch of the AT skirting Mt. Monroe before LOC is closed and our only option is to go over the Peak before continuing down to the Hut. We are exhausted, but it's hard to feel unlucky when we reach the summit to a stellar view of Mt. Washington up close (and almost at sunset at this point) and the lake and Hut at its foot are really something to see. We stagger down and are, thankfully, allowed space in the dungeon where we settle in for the night. Phew","Pemigewasset River

Library(Wolf),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596462,"We did it! We summited Mt. Washington in 50mph winds and under 1/16th of a mile visibility (mild for this Peak) and were more than glad for the bunker-like visitors Center at the top with its full snack bar and gift shop. Ha! We promptly stuff ourselves with nachos and hot chocolate before going back for pizza, chowder, chili and ice cream. As we eat we sit and marvel at the number of tourists pouring into the visitor center, that we had struggled mightily to reach by trail, having come up the mountain via the auto road winding up its eastern face or the cog rail the ferries hundreds at a time straits up the western face. What a difference in experience. We had hoped that our prolonged snack break would give the weather some time for visibility to improve and winds to calm but, upon a speaking with a ranger and the on staff meteorologist, we learn wind speeds are only increasing and with a cold front moving down from the north things are only going to get worse. Our first thought is that it's now or never, we need to hike down from this Peak before things get worse or we'll be stuck. We pack up quickly and step outside...into winds gusting between 70 and 80mph. We take one look at one another - hiking poles and feet planted, struggling just to stay upright - and turn around. Back in the calm of the visitor center we reassess, asking a ranger what our options are. This Peak being so accessible (by trail, road and train) we have quite a few, but they are expensive and becoming less viable by the minute. As we speak to her she is alerted that the train has just stopped running because when Summit wind speeds exceed 80mph it is prone to structural failure. So now our options are the road or the trail. We can try waiting for the weather to calm but the forecast isn't optimistic and the AMC shuttle (our only sure ride down) stops running at 4PM, so we can only wait so long. As luck would have it, as we stand there discussing our options another ranger ending her shift for the day is about to head down and offers us a ride. We conclude this must be the best (and least expensive) option and take her up on it, feeling very lucky. As we ride down the auto road we feel extremely certain that we made the right decision as visibility seems to be merely feet in from of the truck and winds rage around us. Once at the base we now have to consider our options for the night. To hike on from here would cut off approximately 14 miles of trail that we would either have to revisit or consent to skip and I am not exactly open to that option. So we look at lodging in the valley and consider how to return to the summit tomorrow. Luckily we are near the town of Gorham, NH and can stay at a Hostel there relatively cheaply, so that's settled. To get back to the summit tomorrow is now the main concern. Again, our options are trail, road or train. The trail, at first, seems like the worst option, we would have to re-climb the entire mountain from the Notch and then continue on from there (adding 4 tough miles to our day tomorrow) ugh. As we research, however, it begins to look like our only viable option. The shuttle up to the summit costs $31 per person (a weeks worth of food for each of us) and the train is even more! Hitching up is not realistic as every car heading up the mountain has to pay a toll (with extra for every person in the car) so additional riders are generally unwelcome. So it looks like we'll hike! For now we're just glad to be safe and warm in the valley, as we were told many times today: ""The mountain will be there tomorrow"".","Lake of the Clouds Hut
",Mt. Washington Summit,"Jul 06, Fri",1.50
Library(Wolf),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596790,"We were up and out of the Hostel early this morning, eager to get back on trail and pick up where we left off yesterday. We decided on re-climbing Mt. Washington via the Tuckerman's Ravine Trail, the most ""family friendly"" way to climb the mountain with the most gentle ascent possible for climbing over 4000' in 4 miles (we want to minimize our exertion while hiking off-trail miles). We have no problem getting a ride to Pinkham Notch, where the Ravine Trail begins and we start our climb around 9 am...along with just about every tourist in the state. We can't help but enjoy ourselves as this hike is up there with some of the most beautiful we have done this far. The 4.1 miles to the summit takes us only about 2.5 hours and we're back at the visitors center ready to move on! But first...we decided to stop in for a snack, since it's there and we figure we've earned a slice of pizza for our trouble. Before we can get on the (super long) cafe line, we're approached by a woman asking us if we're ""on the trail"" and, when we tell her we are, offers us some mountain top trail magic! We learn her name is 'Bookie', she thru-hiked in 2015, and is now working for a local Hostel where she tries to get out and do some magic as often as possible. She offers us cold sodas, Oreos, our pick of some candy and snack bars and fresh corn on the cob (this last one may sound weird but fresh fruit and vegetables of any kind are few and far between on the trail so this very exciting)! Once we've stuffed ourselves and gotten sufficiently warm in the visitors center we're ready to start the day! It's about 40 degrees on the peak today but skies are clear as a bell so we bundle up and head out, moving fast to keep warm. The views are phenomenal and, even though it cost us a day and some extra hiking, we're so glad to have waited to descend from the peak until today. We can see all the exciting sights and, more importantly, the trail, which is still extremely rocky and treacherous so we're glad for the visibility. We reach Madison Spring Hut around 3:30 and are hoping to score some hot soup (our elevation here is about 1500' lower than on Washington, so it's not as cold, but something warm in our bellies still sounds great). We run into our friend Caveman who offers us an extra chocolate bar he got from some trail magic earlier in the day...sweet! We enjoy our soup and chocolate and feel fortified to push the last 3 miles to our camp for the night. We're glad we stopped because it's a tough section and takes us until almost 7PM to get through. What a day. 
*An aside: Being the tallest Peak in the north east, with the worst weather in the world, Mt. Washington (along with the presidential range, of which it is the centerpiece) draws thousands of visitors each day in the summer. Most of these visitors choose to reach the summit via modern means (i.e. by car, bus or train), but some brave the rocky climb, and it is these daring souls we share our struggle up Tuckerman's Ravine with, sometimes stuck behind the crowds but mostly allowed to pass unhindered by the slow pace (we want to think this is because we look like experienced hikers, but more likely because we smell like thru-hikers).

We are climbing the Wildcats, 5 adjacent peaks over 4000', of which we summit 4, before descending into Carter Notch (our last Hut in the Whites!). The initial ascent is rocky and we move slowly, struggling with the feeling that we're not getting anywhere as we climb between each Peak (only the first Peak is marked as such and there are many high points between each so we think we have summited the last only to continue climbing several times).

The Kennebec River is the only river the AT crosses that is too large to ford but is not spanned by a footbridge or road anywhere near the trail's path. In the early days of the trail hikers would ford the river, but could only do so in fair weather and not during any time when the upstream dam was releasing water (causing a rapid increase in depth and flow). As the trail's popularity increased, the volume of hikers crossing made it clear safe crossing was not always possible and many hikers lost their lives not being willing, or able, to wait for safe crossing. Finally the ATC created a free ferry service for shuttle hikers across, running the entire ""normal"" at hiking season (May-Oct) from 9AM-2PM. Our camp is only 3.7 miles from the river so if we leave at our normal 7/7:30 time we will arrive too early and be waiting in the rain.
