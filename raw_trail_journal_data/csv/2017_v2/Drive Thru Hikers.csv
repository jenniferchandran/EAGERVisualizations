Didn’t have a car for us until he saw we were Fastbreak members (Budget). Got a car for shuttling and drove to Monson, Lakeshore House Hostel. Met Rebecca Anderson in her car as she was leaving to go to the dump. Arrived roughly 5:30pm. Had a private king size room overlooking the lake in the back of the place. Went to the bar to have supper. Rockette who we met upstairs, a hiker, came by and introduced her husband, Rocket. Then we got a table in back and had a great evening.",,"Monson, Lakeshore House Hostel","Sep 06, Wed",0
Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597951,"Turned out to be a beautiful day in Monson. Went to Pete’s Place for breakfast, drove to Greenville and up Moosehead Lake then back roads to Caratunk (hwy201). Down to Bingham then back over to Abbot Village and back into Monson. Had a 2 double bed front room (Room 6) at the Lakeshore House. Talked to one hiker at Lakeshore, his name was Kickstand . Decided to drive into Katahdin Ironwork’s road and drop off rental car. Went all around to Rt. 11 and into Katahdin Ironwork’s road via Gulf Hagas checkpoint on east side. Lady was very nice and asked where we were going. She said go thru to Greenville to Monson, much shorter and of course faster, the entire Katahdin Ironwork’s road is very good.  Dropped one car off at the A T crossing. Talked to Joel and wife on way out thru Hedgehog checkpoint. We told him our plans and would see him in 2 days. Drove back to the Lakeshore House hostel in Monson. Went down and paid then later sat outside by the lake with a self made drink. The waitress came out after a few minutes and asked us if we wanted anything. We asked her if there were any tables in the bar area. She said yes so even though we were thinking of eating somewhere else we ended eating there! And it was open mic night and our table was right next to the 2 man band. We were in charge of the tip jar! We had pizza and enjoyed the band and other people playing their guitars and singing! Went to bed around 10pm",,"Lakeshore House, Monson, Maine","Sep 07, Thu",0
Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597973,"Got up at 5pm, breakfast at Irving gas station, out to Otter Pond parking. Shaws shuttle van was leaving from Otter Pond , talked to a hiker for a minute. Got on trail early, maybe 7 am. There is now a marked trail to the AT, at Long Pond stream, from the parking lot (O.2 miles). Started up Barren Mt. A couple of guys past us. Slow going, had to rest a lot. 4 hours to the top. I am sitting talking to Metlife, taking care of business and 4 hikers (2 guys & 2 girls) come up. We all sit and have lunch at the top. A 5th guy shows up. There is a metal tower there and also threat of rain around. Put on rain flys because of drizzle. Totally exhausted! Decided the best plan was to stay at the shelter, Cloud Pond Lean-to(0.4mi off trail) but its a terrible side trail, down, mucky, hard going around Cloud Pond!. Got there around 2:30pm. Had it all to ourself! Then around 5pm, 3 people (1 gal and 2 guys) show up. They Decide to tent because we are in the shelter. They were Neal, Walt, and Debbie, leaders from the one the trail clubs (AMC, etc.). I went down to the tent sites to talk, had a nice talk with Neal. Then it drizzles and I head back to the shelter. Then it starts to rain! Neal and Debbie show up with maps and sit in shelter as we get a nice downpour for 10-15 minutes. Talk a long time with them. Young hiker, Andrew shows up.  Andrew had volunteered in Gulf Hagas for trail maintenance and is going to hike south for a while. He waits for Neal and Debbie and Walt to finish supper and trail planning in the shelter! The planning conversation was intense  Enjoyed talking to them. They go back to their tents. Another guy came in to the shelter, Oldschool, just out hiking.   Oldschool got his name for old school ideas and old school equipment he used, like external framed backpack, old big boots, etc. He was from Maine and he loves it there!","Monson, Lakeshore House Hostel

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598016,"Got up at 6 am. Got on the side trail at 7:15am. Talked to the Walt and Debbie as they went by, then we stopped at pond to fill water bottle and they went by us. Got to A T at 7:30am. Down to gap then up to 4th Mt. Got there at 11am!  I started out wanting to get to car but started to realize that was not an option. Thought about a side trail to go to the KI road but lots of unknowns and not getting all the AT hiked! So onward to the next shelter. Very, very hard going, up and down, and over again, 4th Mt., 3.5,3rd Mt, Columbus Mt., then down to Chairback Gap and the Lean-to right on the A T! There was a reroute just before the shelter as the books said the shelter was off the trail and they rerouted to go right thru it! Hikers went by all day but can’t remember any of them! Nice viewing from ledges before the shelter. Had several views overlooking the entire valley of the 100 mile wilderness and Long Pond. Got to shelter roughly 5pm. Had it all to ourselves until after dark when young guy comes in. Don’t even talk to him until morning.   Btw 4th Mt. and 3rd Mt. was a very neat glade or bog area with some endangered plant species!","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598019,"Got up at 6 am. Talked to Aussie and got his story. His parents live in Dunedin, FL and were all boarded up and waiting for Hurricane Irma. They were coming up to meet him for the summit but had to stay in FL to deal with the hurricane. Left the shelter about 7:45 and went down steeply to the creek where we stopped to get water. Aussie met us there but he had breakfast so it took him to the boulder drop off before he caught up with us. At a rock slab area we stopped for a break with 3 or 4 young hikers there. They too were complaining of how hard this area was! Finally got up to the viewpoint at the top then came upon the boulder drop off. We carefully traversed down. We were sitting at the bottom when we hear Aussie let out a big whoop and down he comes in less than half the time it took us! I told him as he was passing us that it was fun for him but an accomplishment for Terry & I. Shortly afterwards we pass 3 older hikers going south, a lady and two guys! They must have come from the road but were thoroughly enjoying the hike. The lady asked us if we had seen the big male grouse. No but I told her our own grouse story from the Smokies. We go along flat outcroppings and then down to an area where the stream is on the trail and are in the creek for a long way. Where’s the trail maintenance? Then up and down over a few hills until finally the trail becomes much better and gently goes down as we go along the side of the mountain! This goes on for maybe 2 miles. We finally see something, Terry says it looks like a car but it is only water! Right after that though we come out to the KI road. Then you are on an old road following a creek until ½ mile later you come to the W. Branch of the Pleasant River at a ford. Instead we turn the other way and in O.2 mi we are at our car at 1 pm! We go west to the Hedgehog checkpoint. Stopping to turn in the paperwork Joel comes out to the car and squats next to Terry’s door and says Mr. Keller? Yes! We were concerned about you!. Well it took us an extra day! He had already called the game warden? To advise we were overdue from our hike! I was taken a little bit by surprise by his concern! Thank you Joel! We had to apologize for being out of shape. We continued to Greenville and stopped at the Kineo View Motor Lodge and got a room for one night, the second night TBD. Then on to Monson and Otter Pond to pick up the CRV. All was ok and back to the motel! Clean up, relax, watch TV, and ask about places with spaghetti on the menu. The guy tells us about Kelly’s Landing on Lake Moosehead. Very nice food and we ordered way too much. Salad bar was included and also a bowl of chili we bought. Back to our room.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598021,"Wake up and Terry tells me of a plan he thought of during the night. Let’s go hiking today already! WHAT! I wanted a day off! What happened to my day off?  We had continental breakfast, talked to a couple eating about their trip which was about hunting bear! Went back to our room and slowly started working on our backpacks. Finally I come around and we realize we can get ready just in time before checkout so we don’t get the room for the next night. Instead we head into town, go grocery shopping and take deli food to the park right downtown in Greenville. Enjoy a beautiful day next to the Katahdin, an old lake cruising boat that stills gives tours of the lake. Also several floatplanes landed and took off. Very nice. I made phone calls then Terry says let’s go! Up we go to Hedgehog checkpoint. We go in the little building and sit down until Joel gets to us after doing paperwork on some other people. We tell him our itinerary and say we will be out to the car in two days. He says let’s make it three days! If he wants the paperwork done that way, its OK with us. We are coming out in 2 days. We drop the rental car at the Gulf Hagas parking lot on KI road then proceed to go around on a shortcut, gravel road to Logan Brook Road. Joel had told us the rental car could make it on this road but after bottoming out twice in the CRV we decided we would take the highway around when we completed the hike. Got to the trailhead about 3:10 pm. On the trail at 3:30 pm. A couple came off the trail and started walking toward our car. We talked to them and they were camping at the state park north of Greenville. They had come up from Kokadjo and parked  below the gate on Logan Brook Road to walk on up to White Cap Mountain! Shortly up the trail we meet another couple day hiking to White Cap. They have a big black lab. We stop and talk with them a few minutes. The trail is very nice with many steps to help and some spots of level walking. Get to the Logan Brook Lean-to before 5 pm. Three older guys are already in the shelter. Looks like it’s going to be the old Geezer group! Then another guy shows up. Is there room? Terry & I say yes come on in. So we have Chuck (Noluckchuck), Pete, and Will, all from the Boston area and EZ (Easy) from Washington DC (job for 4 yrs and good severance) but originally from Dalton?, TX east of Dallas. Chuck and Peter were together hiking northbound section. Will was doing 5 days going south and EZ (Easy) had flip-flopped and was coming south. Will brought out his Jim Beam whiskey, a pint. Asked if anyone wanted some. Terry says oh yea and Pete also was very willing! We had a good time talking to all of them but then around 7 pm Terry & I went to go pee. When we came back everybody was quiet as a mouse. We get in our sleeping bags and wait, and wait, to fall asleep!","West Branch Ponds Road

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598022,"Everybody wakes up at 6 am. We talk more to EZ. He asks if the car down at the road was ours. We say yes and he remembers the entire plate! I ask again everybody’s names and where they are from. EZ takes off, then Will. I talk to Chuck and Pete again and I mention genealogy. Chuck says he is descended from John Alden of the Mayflower and Pete is descended from Thoreau. Pete tells us how the Paul Revere story isn’t exactly right as we talk about Boston and the surrounding area. Then off we go at about 7:40 am. Since we are hiking south we meet many thru hikers going north. So many I can’t remember them all especially since I am writing this two days later! There was lady and her daughter, Jamie(returning to finish the 100 mile wilderness after losing her eyeglass lens the year before), Queen Bee(from England will be lost and without direction after completing the hike), Many Miles(got to St. Johns ledges near Kent, CT and fell and split open his head and did a number on his hip last year, started over again from the beginning this year) & Giggles, Two Chairs(part of Riff Raff, an organization that helps thru hikers), Bearfoot & Wants to be First (brothers, one from Ft. Lauderdale and the other from Fayetteville, AR), Bearfoot got his trail name because he was in his tent and a bear after his food bit him on his foot! Then at the Carlos Newhall Lean-to, there was the Montana guy(he moved on) and Powerless from Greensboro, NC . Timeless shows up, then leaves.  Left Eye shows up so we did not get the shelter to ourselves. Powerless has a very nice hammock setup. We’re sitting around having our supper and talking until bedtime.","Logan Brook Lean-To

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598023,"Woke up at 6 am. Powerless was already up and mostly packed. Talked to Powerless and told him good luck with his future and shook his hand. Off he went then Left Eye and us talked. He is from Dothan, AL. We talked about the peanut festival, boiled peanuts, and even Enterprise and the boll weevil statue. Got on the trail roughly 7:40am. Passed several guys and also a middle aged gal that seemed overdressed for the elements and going uphill. Met 3 gals near a creek crossing. Stopped to talk. Told them our story of finishing the trail! They said there were 6 of them doing a section in ME. Then ran into 2 more gals from the 6 and figured out the first gal had been with them.  Continuing on we rested and a couple walked by. Finally down to an old road and the trail finally became enjoyable with 1.5 miles to go! We get to the W. Branch of the Pleasant River and 2 guys and a gal, all older, crossing the river coming towards us. Very easy to cross! Terry goes across as I put my clogs on and put all valuables including Buddy under wraps! Then I come across and wait in the water until Terry can get up and turn around to see me! I continue on to the car in my clogs as Terry catches up! Come out to our car around 1pm.  Put things away, change shoes and start leaving. Just up the road are two vehicles stopped. As we go around it is Joel in one truck and his wife in the other. We stop and talk to Joel about not using the shortcut road as it is too rough for the rental car! He is willing to help us out so as not get charged to come back in to Jo-Mary Rd. We drive to the KI checkpoint. They say that is totally up to Jo-Mary if they want to charge. We told Joel thanks but we’ll take our chances with our story and no paperwork as it is in our car out in the wilderness! Stop at Jo-Mary. The guy finally says just go. Drive to our car on Logan Brook Rd. Come back down, give our paperwork to the guy at Jo-Mary gate and on to Bangor, ME to drop off the rental car. Got to Bangor about 7pm. Terry went to return the car and  couldn’t find anyone outside to check in the car. so we went into the terminal and talked to the same guy that gave us our car early! He said we don’t have staff outside to provide receipts for returned cars; in the winter  they would freeze their butts off and be totally bored also! Drive down to Freeport and find a Super8. Called Budget but could not get a rental car earlier. We were hoping to get back on the trail Thursday! Called Pine Ellis. They had very good rates for shuttling our section except would not do the Bemis Road. Would have to start from Hwy 17, 1.1 mi and 700 foot descent! The Farm House out of Rangeley on the other hand, said no problem to the Bemis Rd. but it would be $150 for the two of us! We will get a rental car tomorrow and shuttle ourselves for the last hike.","Carl A. Newhall Lean-to (1860')

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598024,"Yesterday went  to the Portland airport. Arrived about 11:30-11:45. I had to drive into the rental garage and come in to show them my driver’s license as the reservation was in my name! Off we go to Andover and South Arm Rd. We stop at the market and pick up a few items! Drop the rental off at the trail head on South Arm Rd and drive over to Bemis RR road to check it out. The same as it was two years ago. Very good. We decide we are 30minutes to 1hr. too late to start the hike today! On to Rangeley and got a room at the Town and Lake Motel. Older motel but nice with back porch on the lake and nice views! Go to the IGA grocery store and decide to buy supper and take back to the motel and eat on the back porch of our room! Playing great music in the store; Corina, Corina by Ray Petersen and other songs we knew and liked! Enjoyed supper and fed the 4 ducks leftover chicken we had bought. Sounded too cannibalistic for me but the ducks seemed to enjoy!

Today, Got up around 6 am, had breakfast (egg salad for me and chicken salad for Terry) in our room. Then out to the trailhead on Bemis RR. Started up the trail and up the first bump of Bemis Mt. about 7:15am. The trail went up and up, steadily but it was still fairly cool. Very nice views to the north and west of Sabbath Pond? And Rangeley Lake?! Finally got very hot! Terry took off his new T shirt and managed to lose it on the trail. Got to the Bemis Mt. Lean-to about 10:30am. (3.6 mi?) Terry rested and I went to fill his water bottle up at the small stream/spring nearby. Came back and rested and a guy, Bigstick comes in for lunch from S. Arm Rd.!!!. He’s from VT and was going to Sabbath Pond Lean-to for that night. Terry told him if he found his new shirt he could keep it. Of course it’s a XXL! Took about a 1/2 hour break then onward and upward. Made to the first peak around noon. Rested and make phone calls and texted people. Went on, got hotter, passed several thru hikers including Uncle Puck who was an older guy originally from WI but worked last 20 yrs in Cape Girardeau, MO. Terry kept asking about water supplies and places to stealth camp. Nobody could remember much. Somewhere near the top 2 grouse flush from Terry and then from me as I walk by, scaring me to death. (Side note: I saw 3 snakes at different times and days on the trail, the first one looked like a possible poisonous but small and moving away from me.) Near the top of Bemis, looked at map, said the next knob was it, but only took about 10 more minutes to get there around 3:30-4:00pm (5.0mi). We rested on a rock and made more phone calls. We were so ready to be done but realized we were definitely going to have to camp out that night. Came down and finally to Bemis Stream side trail. We could camp there but the water source was 0.3 miles further. We went on keeping our eyes out for possible camping places. Get to spring, Terry fills up and we go back knowing there was a place not too far back. As I walk back I see a trail going off and follow it 30 feet to a fairly open somewhat level place. Terry checks both out and decides this is ok. We set up camp, get in, and just before dark, 4 guys with a radio blaring out rap music go by. I enjoy how everyone that hikes does it there own way."," Bemis RR Road

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598028,"I got up once to go pee during the night. Otherwise, slept ok until dawn. Terry not as well. Got up early around 6 am and start breaking down camp. On the trail at 7am? THE LAST DAY! We fill up Terry’s water bottles at the same spring on the trail as the previous night. I carried one for Terry to the top of the Old Blue Mt. First we go up over the shoulder of Elephant Mt.  Then back down to Clearwater Brook with several good spots for camping. Then pretty flat with lots of old boardwalks. Passed a hiker. Even though you are hiking up the last mountain (Old Blue) and it is steep and HAAAARRRD your thoughts go to the last 15 years and different little things you remember of the trail. We talk of our weights throughout the entire trail, of different characters we remember from the trail. We think of towns and places off the trail. Of course it would help if we had better memories!! Started up Old Blue. Terry hated it. We finally stop and Terry gets his GPS out. Only 500 ft to go! Up to the top of Old Blue at 10:15 am. Take a nice break. Terry lays out flat on a rock. I make phone calls and text. Three miles to go and very far down!  A couple of sections so steep they give us rebar and handrails to use! The rest is steep enough we go very slowly for safety. Enjoying the down! A couple times we uphill but it was short! What! It doesn’t show that on the profile! We pass 2 girls who had stopped in a low spot. They were having a great time. They ask about our hike and we tell them the story. They are so happy for us! They were doing Maine! On to the viewpoint. We get there at 1:15pm. 0.6 miles to go and 900 feet down. Beautiful view to the south and S. Arm Rd. The leaves are changing! Can see all the way down to the valley floor! The trail stays very close to the edge for a short while (perhaps a trail relocate?) Down we go, getting happier with every step but taking it very slowly so we don’t kill ourselves at the end! A few more rebar then several series of steps that was great. I come around a corner and I see the road, then our car through the trees! I am loudly talking to Terry about seeing the road. We come out, I throw my poles and we ask 2 thru hikers to take our picture. We tell them our story and they are excited for us! They have never talked to a person as they were finishing the entire trail! Seems obvious, but on 3 occasions we have talked to people on their last trail section. We offer them a ride into town (Andover). We get their stories as we drive them to the general store in Andover! They are Captain Whiskers from Nashville, TN and Doctor Gomore from NJ just across from NY City. Luckily we were in the rental car as they smelled pretty ripe in the back seat!   They met up on the trail way back in Georgia. Pretty much stayed hiking together even as they would come off the trail for different things. Plan on summiting in a couple of weeks! We drop them off and wish them good luck! Drive back to Bemis RR road to pick up the CRV but go the long way to enjoy the views from “The Height of Land” with all the lakes and Bemis Mt., etc. Tourists are out! It is Saturday! Get to our car and Terry strips down and washes himself off! All the candy bars and soda are gone from the trail magic cooler! Now we are in two cars and head to Portland!   Drive into the airport car rental garage about 7pm. Get out. I go to the bathroom. Terry returns the car. Hey the bill is wrong! It shouldn’t be more for bringing it back early! The guy fixes it.We get on the interstate and drive out of ME. Terry finds Seabrook Inn in NH for the night! Good! We are tired, dirty, and it is getting foggy. We get our room, clean up and go to Chili’s for supper around 8:30pm. One drink to celebrate! We have completed the Appalachian Trail. For us it was 2173 miles. Its a dream come true. We are so proud of each other.","Stealth campsite, near spring

Cindy is not really interested in publishing our Trail Journal. I will try to make the job easier  by using various software to transcribe and edit our Appalachian Trail Journals.
