Jeff Gerhards,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555957,"I was wondering if anyone has any tips on tracking hiker progress on the AT. I am very interested in hiking the trail at some point, but until then, I would like to set up a trail magic stop in PA to help lift morale during the rocky hiking days of my lovely state. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to find out when/where would be the best time to do this? I want to get the most traffic that I can. Any help would be appreciated.","

Jeff Gerhards,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556452,"I can not wait to hike the Appalachian Trail. This dream of mine will continue to be a dream for awhile longer, but the desire to get out there only seems to grow year after year. I have a great wife and two small children at home and a great job. At this point, I am not willing or able to part with any of these things. Right now the hike is just an idea, but that doesn't stop me from planning and continuing to refine my gear. Gear selection is fun. I am reading books about the trail (currently reading ""Hear the Challenge: Hike the Appalachian Trail"" by Kyle Rohrig), reading the trail journals of 2016 thru hikers is also very interesting. I find it funny that I can completely become consumed by the daily events of anyone that is out on the trail, whether they are a 70 year old woman, hiking by herself, a newly retired couple, or a 36 year old man, like myself. While I wait my opportunity to take on this adventure for myself, I look forward to when this years hikers get close to PA, so I can go out and set up a tent and hopefully become a valuable 'trail angel' providing comfort through our rocky state. I live an hour away from ""The Pinnacle"", so somewhere near that area.","

Somewhere close to a parking lot would be best. Also, what is the best food/drink items that would be wanted?","The trail
