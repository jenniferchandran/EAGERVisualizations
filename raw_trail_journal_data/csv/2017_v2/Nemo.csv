It was expensive and not great, but that was probably because we came in right before closing time. We were so hungry that we were grateful for it anyway.

Today was a decent hike. I was glad to finally get on trail, even if it was later than I had hoped. The roast beef from Arby's was a big plus, though. I think I'll save my extra sauces for later on the trail. Planning to hike to Gooch tomorrow.","Big Stamp Gap

Last night was AWFUL! I got little sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, I saw MICE in the shelter, so I said, ""Nope. Nope. Nope,"" and set up my hammock. It looked a little clearer than it had to that point, so I figured that I wouldn't need my tarp, just my bivy sack. Boy, was I wrong. It rained basically all night. I got about 3 hours of sleep all night, and my sleeping bag got SOAKED. I made it to Gooch, and my stuff had time to dry out, but then I realized, after opening the package, that my meal needed MILK. Guess what I didn't get, liquid or otherwise. That's right. Milk. Also, my pot was too small to cook it all at once, so I made two batches. The first was awful, super tiny and liquidy, so the second batch I tried to make with less water. It was worse. Much worse. I'll save the rest of those until I get to Neels Gap and can get some dried milk.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Today started out alright, but I didn't get quite as much sleep as I wished and it was kind of cold. Then it went to s***. I had a hiking buddy I met on the trail, Tyler, who filtered some water for me with his Sawyer filter just before lunch (I am getting a full size Sawyer at Neels, period), but I didn't get enough then. As I came to Jarrad's Gap, I was trying to decide if I should filter there or push on to Woods Hole Shelter and filter there. I figured that shelters always had water, so I should be good to push on with my 2/3 liter of water. WORST IDEA EVER. I'm not sure how I'll make it to Maine if this keeps up. I think I'll take the wimpy way out tomorrow rather than go up Blood. I'm so depressed. If things don't look better in the morning, I'm not sure what I'll do.","Gooch Shelter

Today was a very good day. I woke up hopeful, bright, and ready to go. I decided to just do Blood, which was the right choice, because it was actually pretty easy. I actually made it all the way up without stopping once. The hard part was actually coming down. One of the blazes was way off to the side and hidden, so I ended up walking like a half mile out of the way. Apparently, this is so common that they have had multiple people get lost on the way down, and one of the workers here at Neels was going up to put up a sign that says, basically, ""AT this way,"" which would have helped a lot. Missing the trail wasn't fun, but the nice man on the ACTUAL trail was a saint. I'm not entirely sure he wasn't LITERALLY a godsend. He gave me some water, because I was out. Bone dry. That was great. But I have to say, the first glimpse of Neels Gap was the most welcome of the day. I needed this day to decompress, reorganize, and reevaluate my gear. I am planning to be in Hiawassee by Monday, so that'll be good. That's where my first bounce box is, so I should be able to finish up with my gear overhaul. I'm feeling much better about tomorrow. I'm planning to leave here with ALL 6 liters of water, so I shouldn't have to filter until dinner. That's going to be nice.","Woods Hole Shelter

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554867,"I only made a little over 10 miles today. I was thinking about making some more, especially since I made it to the shelter by only 1:30, but I was wet, and cold, and it was still raining and dreary, so I stopped. Today was alright, hiking wise, but my hips were hurting me earlier-I forgot my lesson about having things in my hip belt pockets. I should be getting pretty close to Hiawassee tomorrow (and my bounce box-yay!), only about a day or so out. I'll probably catch a ride into town, though I'm not sure if I'll take a zero or just a nero, with a long, hot bath waiting for me at the end, and getting moving the next day, which sounds like the best plan. I'll know for sure tomorrow.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554869,"Okay, so... Yesterday's plan didn't exactly pan out. Today, I had planned on getting up early, getting to Blue MTN shelter about 10:00-11:00, having a nice, leisurely lunch/rest before heading out for the last 8 miles for the day. However, I didn't hit BMS until about 11:45-12:00ish, which meant 2 things: 1) I hadn't been moving nearly as fast as I had planned, and 2) I had about as much hiking light to walk 8 miles as it had taken me to walk 7 miles on relatively flat ground. That was no bueno.
So I got to Unicoi Gap, and decided to catch a shuttle to a nearby hostel (Top of Georgia), even though my night in Neels was only 2 days ago. Since my mail is still in Hiawassee, and unavailable today due to it being Sunday, I think I'll go back to the trail tomorrow, get at least as far as Tay Mountain shelter, probably as far as Low Gap, and then catch a ride into town on Tuesday, and possibly take a nero on that day (although it would have to be my last hostel stay for a while, since I hadn't planned on nearly this many, before heading out early the next morning). I need to be hitting the Smokies, about 100 miles away, before the end of February, so I'm going to need to keep an eye on that. I do feel like I'm starting to get my trail legs, though, which is a big plus.","Low Gap Shelter

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554972,"Today was exhausting. It was alright until this afternoon, when suddenly, all at once, both of my knees and my left foot started hurting. I was going up Kelly Knob, and it was all I could do to keep myself moving. When I got to camp at the shelter tonight, after getting water, I realized why my foot was hurting. I had had a blister. ""Had"" had because it had already popped by the time I noticed it.
I think my socks are part of the problem-I kept meaning to get socks that fit me before I left AR, but I never got the chance. I'll see if they have any at ToG tomorrow. Also, there are mice in this shelter as well. Other than those things, today was alright. I got as far as I hoped, made some decent miles, and I'm in a position where I can get out early tomorrow--just 3 miles to the hostel. Looking forward to that nice bed. Well, good night. I'm going to put some Neosporin and a band aid on my foot before it gets infected.

",Deep Gap Shelter,"Feb 20, Mon",13.10
Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554973,"I went into town today. Actually, I should probably start at the start. I woke up this morning and my foot was feeling better. I was able to make it to the hostel, about 4 miles away. When we got to the hostel, Butterfeet and I both took long, hot showers, and both got our laundry done. He's been really helpful to me these past couple days, so I covered his cost for the night. We went into town, to the Mexican place this time. Their salsa was excellent-smooth, not chunky, just how I like it. I got ""La Changa,"" which is 2 chimichangas, baked or fried, with either beef or chicken, and topped with cheese. Too bad for everyone else I left my lactose pills back at the hostel by accident. It was probably the best Mexican I've had in a while. I went to the store today, Ingles, with Butterfeet.
I got some spices to make the Mountain House meals actually edible. Butterfeet and I decided to hike together at least as far as Nantahala, about 5 days away. He's also an Eagle Scout, just like me. He's a fun guy to be around, despite his #northvirginiaproblems, such as, my personal favorite, having 2 or 3 things you could do that weekend and only deciding on Friday night, because you don't want to ""waste your weekend."" Literally his exact words. Having most of the day to just chill was pretty nice, although I'm definitely itching to get back on the trail. Thankfully, my blister healed today, so that's a big plus. I'm going to get an early start tomorrow, so I'd best be getting to sleep now.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555089,"Today was more fun than an ENTIRE barrel of monkeys. An ocean barge full of barrels of monkeys. First, I wanted to leave early, but wasn't able to actually be packed up and ready to go until about 9 (had to wait on Butterfeet to pack some things). Then, we finally made it on trail about 9:15, and we made it to the first shelter, Plumorchard Shelter, by about 11. That's nice, about 2 mph, so we decided to have a quick snack at the shelter, where we met ""Nickel"" from FL and ""Ranger"" from OK, and stayed talking. Good thing is, they said that ""Courthouse Bald"" was actually pretty easy. Pretty quickly, 5 minutes turns into 30, and it was almost 11:45 by the time we made it back onto trail. We stopped for lunch about 1:30-2:00, a little before crossing the GA/NC border. It was decent, but nothing special. 
Next, we came to this ""not that bad"" hill (*cough*mountain*cough*). It was steep. I mean REALLY steep. I mean ""Cliffs of Insanity"" steep, in a couple places. Seriously. This was that same mountain that Nickel had told us wasn't actually all that bad just that morning. Ha. It was even steeper in some places than in the book. By the end of the day, I was so tired I wasn't making much sense, nor was I in a very good place mentally. Butterfeet actually made me lie down on his pad for a little while and rest with a nature valley bar and some water. Dinner was pretty good. I finally had that teriyaki and salmon I'd been carrying since the first day. It was absolutely delicious.
I did realize, however, that instead of pushing on to Nantahala Outdoor Center like I had hoped, I have to stop in Franklin, NC. My pack is the wrong size, and there is no way to adjust it. It makes for a lighter pack, which I suppose is the point of an ultralight pack that removes even the frame itself to save weight, but it means that I have to get an entirely new pack. There is a pretty good outfitter in Franklin, Outdoor 76, that should be able to help, and for much cheaper than NOC. Then, I'm going to push on to NOC and get my mail and take a little bit to sort everything out. Looking forward to that hotel room in Franklin, though.","Top of Georgia Hostel

It's difficult to capture in a journal. Some of the views today were amazing, especially because we were in a cloud yesterday-literally, walking inside a cloud. The evidence of the recent fires today, especially compared with yesterday, is startling. Talking about politics is generally problematic. The people are interesting, though. I made it 12.5 miles today, which was cool because it's been my longest day so far, but not cool, because I need to be making more, and also because making those 12.5 made me very tired.

I did, however, order over $50 worth of Domino's pizza and sides (sandwich, chicken wings, pasta, breadsticks, etc.). I actually only even got 1 pizza. It was all pretty good, though nothing special. The reason I didn't journal last night, the 25th, is because I didn't even GET to camp until 8:00, and then I had to set up my hammock and everything, so it was about 9 pm by the time I got to sleep.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556304,"So... today was frustrating. It turns out that, even if I had managed to get my packages yesterday, I would have only gotten 1 of them - the other didn't come in until 11:00 today, which means T.O.G. didn't send my package until the day AFTER I gave it to them. That was frustrating. What makes it even more frustrating is that I didn't even get OUT until 1:30 almost, so I didn't get NEARLY as far as I had hoped - I made it to Sassafras Gap Shelter @ 143.7 (6.8 miles), but I had been hoping to possibly make it as far as Brown Fork Shelter @ 152.8, which would have made 15.9 for the day. I was hoping to make it that far so that I could be a Fontana until you hit Mollie's Ridge, 14 miles later, and Fontana is just like NOC - you go ALL the way down, then come ALL the way back up. I was hoping to hit Fontana tomorrow night because that would mean that I could make it to Newfound Gap - basically the only road in the Smokies, on a Friday night - Nana and Papa are willing to put me up on a Friday and Saturday night, in a hotel room even, but I have to make it to Gatlinburg (or at least Newfound Gap, from which I can have road access to Gatlinburg). If I could have made it by Friday, I could have had my first actual ZERO day since 2/12. (I went up to Springer with the family on 2/13 before actually starting on 2/14.) I haven't taken any full-on zero days yet - I've just taken a few NERO (near zero) days, which weren't really neroes, just shorter days (coming into Neels Gap on 2/16 was my shortest day at like 5 miles). I was looking forward to a full-on ZERO day in an actual, nice HOTEL room, not a MOTEL like I had to do in Franklin. Unfortunately, I won't hit Newfound Gap until the night, either the Friday or the Saturday, so I won't get to spend a full day with them, unless I damn near kill myself getting to Fontana by tomorrow night, or doing some absolutely RIDICULOUS miles one day in the Smokies. I suppose it's for the best that I don't get to Fontana until Wednesday, since my package from home won't arrive until at least then. Besides, if I can make it to Cable Gap - 158.9 (15.2 miles) - tomorrow, it'll put me less than 6 miles from Fontana, so I should be able to get in and have the better part of the day to relax. That'll be nice. I didn't get a chance to call the GSMNP today like I had planned, since the shelter doesn't have NEARLY a strong enough signal to support a call. I need to call from Cable if possible, but definitely from Fontana if I can't tomorrow. I NEED to see about fixing my permit from the day-use to the thru-hiker permit. If not, I'll need to spend $20 to get the correct permit. Oh well, I hope to get a MUCH earlier start tomorrow. I've got the wrap from NOC that I was planning on eating for lunch today, so that'll make a good breakfast in the morning. The bad thing is that using the GPS feature on my watch for only 3 hours used up about 20-30% of my battery, so I don't really ahve enough to use it all day tomorrow. I think I'll find a good spot for lunch and just turn it on after lunch as a measure of how far it is to the shelter, to try and preserve battery life. I think that's what I'll HAVE to do moving forward.
I think I'm about done for the night. Oh, wait - I met a couple new people tonight. One is ""Penguin"" (because he has a jacket with a logo for some company named Penguin) and some guy named ""Acadius,"" which is the scientific species name for the ""Northern Saw Whet Owl,"" because he did his senior project on them. He has a wildlife management degree, which is cool. His senior project for his degree involved tagging and banding the birds, hence the name.

He was getting onto the trail yesterday at the NOC, and his mom was dropping him off, so I've been ragging on him about that ever since. Acadicus dropped behind today - his knee has been giving him some trouble, so he's been shelter hopping. I left him behind - as I was finishing up packing up after lunch, he was just walking up to the shelter.
Sara made it to the shelter last night, but she didn't make it to the shelter tonight because of the storm. Butterfeet is now bragging about how good he is at snowboarding and skiing. I think that I'm going to see how tomorrow looks before making any final decisions on planning.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556306,"So... There was a massive rainstorm yesterday which got us all soaked, but today, God upped the ante by hitting us with an even BIGGER thunderstorm. We made it to Fontana - Butterfeet, Penguin, Storyteller, and I - in time for lunch, and even had a few hours to do laundry and go through our (Butterfeet's and mine) packages. Mostly, they were full of food - way more food was in each than I think the TWO of us could eat. Sara came up as I was finishing up my laundry, so we started chatting a bit. She found the fact that I talk aloud to myself amusing, since she generally just keeps it in her head. For reference, I have started just... talking... to God. Just, while I'm out here, alone, talking to him. I try to listen when he answers, which generally is not just hearing a voice that tells me ""yes"" or ""no,"" but rather... it's difficult to explain. It's more than a feeling (no, not that song), but also less certain - kind of. It's really hard to explain, so I'll just leave it at this - I can GENERALLY tell when I thought something up, or when it came from God (though not always). Like I said, it's difficult to explain, with a lot of uncertainty. Anyway, I also talk out loud to myself about other things as well - for instance, I had a solid 45-minute ""argument,"" with myself, about the various types and strengths of optical jutsu (Sharngan, Rinnegan, and, to a lesser extent, Byakugan). Seriously. Talking, out loud, to myself.
Anyhowsoever, as much fun as it is to spin my wheels talking to myself on my own (not that song, either), and as much as it helps the miles pass by, talking to myself probably is not the best habit to get myself into, seeing as how, back in society, talking to someone whom others cannot see is frowned upon. 
Anyway, I'm going to try to hit the ground running tomorrow, so that I can get as close to Nana and Papa as possible by Saturday. I've decided to just let my permit be, even if it technically is the ""wrong"" permit. Hopefully, the rangers won't notice (or care, if they do) that my permit is a little off on the dates, although I'm not sure how likely that is.

Also, I got my music to work on 3/2, but I'm not sure how much I'll use it, since it is interfering with my conversations with God, although the mania I can FEEL coming on doesn't help matters in the slightest. 
I went to a Western Sizzlin' style place with Nana and Papa tonight. I ate 4 whole plates worth of food! (I got 5 plates, and the stuff that was no good was left, but it was enough to fill a plate.) Spending some time with Nana and Papa was pretty cool. Apparently, though I forgot, Butterfeet was invited also. I guess that it's a shame he wasn't willing to press on with me yesterday. His loss. 
Anyway, that ice coming down Clingman's Dome today was also    NUTS. It ticked me off so hard. I'm going to poke a hole in this journal if I keep thinking about it, so no more. 
I took a bath tonight. It was just as relaxing as I thought it would be - calm, peaceful, hot. My new backpack seems to be holding up well, especially since Nana and Papa brought me a neck pillow - that'll certainly help my neck feel better, and it means I'll have an ACTUAL pillow to rest my head at night. They also got me a space blanket (yes, please), a towel (thanks), and a... cooling rag? In March? Okaaayyy...

3/9 - I don't really have an excuse. I had my first full, true ZERO day, as opposed to just neroes. It actually turned out alright, I just wasted a lot of time that I COULD have spend getting ready for today. Because of that fact, I didn't get on trail until 2:45 pm, so I didn't get to camp until 7:30ish. The sun set @ 6:30, so dark really fell about 7:00. And I DID (note past tense) have grand plans, both for yesterday and today, but OF COURSE they went awry. 
There was a lookout tower I went up to, but it was quite windy, and the floor was so rotten there were holes in some places. I took a few pictures and went back down. The views today, all two or three of them, were really quite nice. I managed to get my music up and today, courtesy of Dad (thanks to him, by the way). 
It is pretty cold here right now, so I'm not sure how much more I'll write before I go to sleep. Night hiking was SLIGHTLY better than I remembered, mostly because my headlamp has good batteries and I was wearing my jacket. 
Oh, that reminds me - 3/7 - I got hypothermia. Yay. I got caught in a sudden rain - Ok, so it had been lightly raining for awhile, but it all of a sudden picked up big time. I didn't have rain pants, so my legs still would have gotten cold, but I could have put on my rain jacket to protect my core. Luckily, I had my pack cover on, so all my gear stayed dry, but I was still very cold that night. The first thing I did when I got to camp was to change into dry clothes and crack open 3 hot hands. Two went in my sleeping bag, but the third stayed in my pants pocket. It helped somewhat, but not terribly. I was definitely glad that town was the next day, because that meant I could wash and dry my clothes, as well as grab my down coat from my box. That went right in with my dry clothes (my pjs that are never - repeat NEVER - to get wet, so they make sure the down stays dry as well). 
So, my fingers are almost numb, but I have a little more to write. The meal I had at the Smoky Mountain Diner in town was AWESOME! I had a double cheeseburger with bacon and a ""side"" of curly fries. I use quotations because it almost filled the plate - it didn't because the burger itself was probably 6"" across. It was HUGE. The shower, as well as the warm bed in a PRIVATE room, was extremely nice. The hostel, Laughing Heart Hostel, was super chill about everything, so that was nice. They had a full kitchen, complete with food there, as well as some other cool stuff. It was a sweet gig, and pretty cheap too. Only $35/night for my own private room.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556211,"Today was both pleasant and disappointing. Pleasant, because I woke up and got on trail before 8:00, which, for me (on this trip at least), is quite impressive. Unfortunately, however, I did not make the miles that I had been hoping to make. I had to stop at 15.9 (Hogback Ridge Shelter) because I didn't hit IT until 7:30, and I was NOT looking to walk another 6.7 in the dark. So I stopped here for the night. 
Part of the reason I didn't quite make the miles I was hoping to hit is that I spent 2 hours walking to and being at Hemlock Hollow Hostel. They are fairly small, and it has a new owner, so they're still working things out, but still. 
Anyway, I paid them $15 to slackpack all of 6 miles, something which I do NOT plan on repeating. If I slackpack again, it'll be for an entire day, and I will spend the night in the hostel on either side (both nights, with the slackpacking day in the middle). I had to slow down my pace a good deal to not get there ridiculously before them (I still waited 15 minutes). I was able to have them bring me a couple of pizzas and a can of Coke, so that I wouldn't have to make my lunch. It cost me $6 all told. 
I also discovered today that my pack cover barely does - I have to stretch it a little more than I am comfortable with to get it to fit over all my stuff. Fortunately, this one does, once stretched, ACTUALLY covers my pack, unlike the Outdoor Products one I got at Walmart in Gatlinburg (Pigeon Forge) with Nana and Papa. That one doesn't actually have the right contours for my pack (or most any pack with a hip belt).
Also, have I mentioned how much I *#$&% HATE *%&$*# NIGHT HIKING? No? Well, I do! When I got to the 6 person shelter tonight, I had to ask one of the 3 guys in the shelter to scootch over so I could even have enough room for my sleeping bag. Also, my pace drops significantly (by at least 1/3, guaranteed, usually by 1/2 or more). For instance, I covered the 5.7 miles this morning, before the hostel, in about 2 hours, so I was feeling pretty good. They next 2 hours I completely wasted, and it took me almost 3 hours to hike 6 miles with no pack. Then, once I got going again, about an hour after they gave me my pack and food again, it took me about an hour to go 3 miles, which isn't bad, but then it took me a full hour (or more) to go 1.5 miles, because it was, to quote AWOL, ""very rocky and strenuous."" Wrong. Rocky and strenuous is a class 3 climb. In several places, the climbs were AT LEAST a 4, and in 2 places, there were some 5.1, 5.2 climbs. On a HIKING trail. Where 40# (with food and water) is desirable and even LIGHT for a pack. That's just ridiculous. I took some pictures. Each of them was taken with the phone COMPLETELY LEVEL (at eye level) on the x, y, AND z axes, but it looks like the camera is on the ground and leaning away from the frame. At one point, the trail came up (at a 4 again) and passed through a narrow gap in the rocks. As in, so narrow my pack almost didn't even FIT through the gap. It was a crazy mile and a half. Anyway, the sun set about 25 minutes after I made it out of that (made it out ~ 6:15, sun set ~ 6:40), so it was dark by 7:00. When I got out of the rocks, I had 2.5 miles to go, so I was hoping to make it before dark. Well, I only made it 1.5 miles (largely because I was messing with my music), in about 40 minutes, so I hiked the last mile in actual darkness. The lights from the city (I believe Greeneville) were pretty, though, so seeing them was nice.
I think that's about it for the night, so I'm going to hit - no, wait. I forgot. Since I couldn't make the miles I needed to today, I need to make them up tomorrow - I only brought enough food for 3 days, so I'm already pushing it. If I can make the 25 miles tomorrow, I'll be exactly back on track. Unfortunately, there's not a shelter between 15 and 25 miles, and with the snow, that's supposed to come later tonight, I think the shelter will be the only DRY place to sleep tomorrow. We shall see. If I make the 15 mile shelter before 3:00, I'll push on; otherwise, I'm going to stay the night and make Nature Valley bars my ""meals"" until Erwin, which will be another 25 miles from that point. That's no fun. I like to arrive in towns BEFORE everything closes, so making 25 miles would be unfortunate, though so would having to have Nature Valley bars be my ""meals"" for a full day. Anyway, we'll see how it goes. If I can't get up moving in the morning, I won't make the 25 miles anyway, and since it's 10:32, I'd best get to sleep now so I CAN wake up with my alarm at 5:30 am. It's ""Separate Ways/Worlds Apart"" by Journey, which is probably my favorite song, especially for waking up and/or getting motivated, so that helps. Anyway, I said I would be getting to bed almost 5 minutes ago, but I'm still writing. Go figure.

Nemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556298,"At least I made it this far tonight. It's 15.5 for the day, which makes me sad (I was hoping to hit Bald Mtn. Shelter - 25.6 - for the day). Unfortunately, I didn't get up and moving with my alarms - I didn't even get out of my sleeping bag until almost 10:00, and I didn't hit the trail until 11:50. I need to get moving when my alarm goes off tomorrow. I'm hoping to make 20 miles, but I only made it here as the sun was setting (actually the sun had already set, but only just). If I could have gotten moving when my alarm went off at 5:30, I could have been on trail by 7:00; in that case, I could easily have made the 25 miles today. But alas, 'twas not to be.
Anyway, one of the 3 guys from last night came to THIS shelter tonight. One of them chose to stay at the first shelter, 6.7 miles for the day. The last one apparently went to Erwin (I'm pretty sure by catching a lift from Laurel Hostel - sketchy place, would NOT recommend). Funny story, he's as old as my parents.
Anyway, today was surprisingly difficult. I'm not sure why; hopefully tomorrow will be easier. If I can make it the 20 miles, I'll only have about 5 or 6 before Erwin. I need to make it there at a time when resupply is available, since I only brought 3 days worth of meals. Today is the 2nd day (the 3rd for my budgeting of dinners, because I wasn't planning on being full still from lunch on Friday), so I've got enough breakfast for tomorrow. Thankfully, my lunch for the 3rd day can be broken up so that I can have half for breakfast the next day, and then it'll only be 6 miles or so into Erwin, so I can resupply, eat lunch there, and then push on.
Also, I've been having some trouble with my alarms, so I hope that goes away when I wake up tomorrow.
Anyway, the views today were great, but it's getting late, so I've gotta get some sleep. I don't want a repeat of this morning tomorrow (although the lack of snow should help). Anyway, night guys.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Today was disappointing. I didn't get nearly as far as I had hoped, so that stinks. I'm glad that I chose to stay in the shelter, though, listening to the rain outside makes me glad I didn't try to push I would have had a hard time of it, and I don't think I would have made it to the next shelter before the rain hit. The reason I stopped here tonight, instead of pushing the extra 10.6 to No Business Know Shelter is because, when I got here I was cold, frustrated, and depressed. I don't know if I wrote about Clingman's Dome in my journaling (answer is... yes, I did). Anyway, the mud today was just as bad. Worse, actually. For one, it was LONGER than the ice, and for two, the mud wasn't just slippery - it also sucked at my boots when I was trying to lift my foot to take a step. That was not fun. 
Anyway, I decided to stop and have plenty of daylight for my evening preparations. I've been getting to the shelters pretty late, because I've been getting late starts. Unfortunately, that means my body doesn't want to get up and moving as early as I would like, so I get a later start... Hopefully, getting in early (and, thus, to bed early) will help reset my system. I decided that I'm going to sleep in the next day's clothes, so that's one less thing to do in the morning. Another thing I'm going to (try) to do is unzip my sleeping bag slightly more than is really comfortable (although I'll be sure to be comfortable enough to get some sleep), so that I have one less reason to stay in my sleeping bag in the morning. Hopefully, that'll mean I can wake up earlier. I also moved my alarms BACK some, to make sure my body wasn't going to fight them in the morning. I remember reading something about ""sleep inertia"" in Reader's Digest, where if you keep waking up to your alarm, but then hit snooze and go back to sleep, you're telling your body it's okay to continue being asleep, not that it needs to wake up. 
Anyway, I'm hoping to hit Erwin tomorrow (otherwise I've got no food), so I need to get up bright and early. That means going to sleep now.

Anyway, the dinner shuttle went to a little strip mall with a Mexican place (where we ate), a liquor store (not interested), and and Italian place (also delicious) that was dinner tonight, then went about 200 yards to to Walmart behind the strip. I was able to resupply there for all the way to Roan Mtn, TN (my next goal).
Funny story... So, a couple of people just showed up-Doc and his daughter Tunes. Apparently, they have been exactly a day behind me for a month-they've been playing ""Finding Nemo"" since like the third or fourth day. I just think that the most interesting part is that they've been exactly a day behind me-when they stopped for lunch, they looked at the register and I had stopped for lunch exactly one day before.

There was a McDonald's next door, and Taco Bell, Bojangles, and something else across the street. I also caught the lunch shuttle, which went to a pizza buffet next to a Dollar General, with a Price Less across the way. After eating my fill, I went with the others across to the Price Less, where I got a steak (a cheap one), some sauce and steak seasoning, some uncrustables, and a loaf of white bread. As soon as I got back to the hostel, I seasoned that steak and started it marinating. I then sat and kneaded it for at least an hour to tenderize it, then threw it in the fridge to marinate. Oh, I forgot - while I was at Walmart, I was able to find Reese's Pieces Eggs like I've been seeking to no avail. They are freaking DELICIOUS!

I was planning to hit Clyde Smith Shelter (368.9), which would have been 17.8 for the day (since I slackpacked to Indian Grave Gap yesterday, I was starting from there today). When I stopped for lunch, I had an epiphany. Why the @&^% would I have my longest day be the only day when I am SURE I won't start before 11:00/11:30? So I decided that I would be reasonable and only go the 8.4 miles to this shelter (which, coincidentally, matched me back up with my original plan, just 3 days later), and go the 17.6 tomorrow to Roan High Knob Shelter, then roll into Roan Mtn, TN, the next day, which will now be Sunday, 3/19. I'm glad I'll hit it when I do, since otherwise I would run out of my medication AGAIN, and would get WAY off schedule. That's why I only resupplied with 3 days worth of food. Most of the other hikers I'm with resupplied for 6 or 7 days, so that they could push all the way to Damascus before resupply. I need to stop in Roan Mtn. anyway, so I figured I would just resupply for another 3 or 4 days there for the push to Damascus. 
I can't wait to drop some of this weight I'm carrying (dropping my winter gear should drop me like 5#s), so that'll be nice. Unfortunately, because of this cold snap in March, I'll hold onto it until the beginning of April. I'll probably send it back then and replace it with some lightweight summer gear. I'll drop my winter bag, my down coat, maybe my reflector pad (I'll keep my air pad, though). I might trade my fleece pants for some lighter pjs, and I won't have to carry any more Hot Hands. That, all together, should save me several pounds. 
It's actually surprisingly early that I'm in bed and writing this (it's only 8:00 now), so I'll get to bed and get plenty of sleep. I should be able to get up and moving tomorrow, then, so I can (hopefully) get to camp pretty early tomorrow (like today). The goal is to get on a schedule where I get up and ON TRAIL by 7:00-8:00, so I can make a fair amount of miles and still get to camp by 4:00-5:00. That way, I can get to bed early, so I can get up and moving on time, etc.
Anyway, I'll make it to Roan High Knob tomorrow, so I'll make it to Roan Mtn. by Sunday. Have I mentioned that I'm really excited to be able to get up and moving on time tomorrow?

Getting on trail by 7:30 this morning almost wasn't even enough - I made it here only about 6:00, which kind of is contrary to the goal about getting in at a decent hour. There were some big climbs, granted, but I still wish I could have been moving faster. I barely hit 2 mph this afternoon. Typically, I can average 2.3-2.6 for prolonged stretches. I can make 3, sometimes even 4-5, for a time, but then I have to slow back down again.

The service was not that great, though. They charged me $3 for a drink, but never refilled it. I was there for over an hour, and they NEVER refilled my drink. By the time I got ready to go and walked out of there, it was about 2:30, so I called Marion Transit to see if I could catch the 2:30 back out to the trailhead. The lady on the phone gave me a very unequivocal ""no."" Not ""maybe,"" or ""let me see..."" Just ""no."" Well, alright then. She did provide me with the name and number of a person I could call who might give me a ride. It turns out that her saying ""no"" saved my $0.50 on a bus ride, since he was free. He actually saved me $1, because I still had to drop by the PO, then head out, which would have been 2 rides. Anyway, with all of that, I didn't hit trail again until about 4:00, and I actually walked a little slower (ok, a LOT slower) right at the start to try and give my pictures a chance to upload here. After about 20 minutes, I said, ""You know what? Forget it. I'll try at camp."" I then made it all 6.8 by 7:15 or so, about 2.2-2.3 mph (counting that first bit, w/o, it's like 2.5 mph). Speaking of camp, I'm alone tonight, a rare occasion. Unlike the 1 other time that this has happened, I actually have water here. FYI, the only other night was Woods Hole Shelter, way back before Neel's Gap, when there was NO water at all. The quiet is nice. Hopefully, I'll wake up just as energized and ready to go tomorrow as I did that next day. My plan is to go to the shelter at 19.3 (the VERY NEXT ONE), although I may stay at the hostel about 2 miles short of that. Either way, there's a shelter 20 miles after the next one, which is my goal for Saturday night, before cruising in that last little bit into Bland on Sunday. I was looking at my map, and I realized that Pearsburg is actually closer than I had though, by about 20-30 miles. I might make Pearsburg by Wednesday, or even pass it. Sadly, from last night, I have to make 18/day to get to Katahdin on time. Today puts me at a net of -1.2 (1.2 behind), with 16.8. If I go to the hostel tomorrow, that'll put me at -2.1. The next day I would make it all up, though, and even build a touch of cushion. If I make it to the shelter tomorrow, then I'd be at +0.7 (0.7 ahead of schedule). Either way, that next day, going either 20 or 22, will generate the exact same amount of cushion, leaving me somewhere around +3.0. But night is now falling (just like this rain), and so ends this day. My bed is now calling, and I must away.","Trimpi Shelter
