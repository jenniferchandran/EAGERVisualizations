Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552493,"I registered for my NOBO hike beginning March 23rd,2017. It looks as though only about 6 other people will be hitting the trail with me that day from Springer Mountain, but clearly that number will rise as the season gets in full swing. I will be staying at the Hiker Hostel on the night of the 22nd and booked their thru hiker special which allows for a bunk, pick up from the bus station, shuttle to Springer, breakfast, and an 8oz. fuel canister for $85. That's a pretty solid deal when you look at other transportation options. The owners are past thru hikers and the place looks like an ideal to crash before setting out. I'm looking forward to meeting some heads there that I may be hiking with for a spell.....",,View Entry,"Dec 24, Sat",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552667,"I just received my official trail registration letter in the mail yesterday. Enclosed was the AT tag to be attached to your pack. I doubt that I will actually put it on but it is a cool thing to have nonetheless. I have a plan to run between 5-10% of the trail with some help of slackpacking once I get my trail legs under me. This may be risking injury, but it is a risk I'm willing to take to cover some more miles with a more diverse avenue to mix it up. I had knee surgery in August and was on the shelf for the better part of a year but I feel strong going to the gym each morning on the Lateral X machine. If you haven't seen one of these machines they are basically a mix between speed skating, an elliptical, and a stair climber. They are perfect for building back the muscles in my quads that were lost due to inactivity. My gear list is pretty much completely finished so there will not be much, if any, last minute gear shopping and/or researching. I hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday season with friends and loved ones!-Kyle",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Mon",0

Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552874,"Hola, ladies and gents! Let's talk budget. I ran some numbers last evening that feel pretty reasonable. With this budgeted approach I am hoping to stay on the trail as often as possible while minimizing zero days, unless one is deemed absolutely necessary. One of my goals is a to keep my zeros (not covering any miles in a 24 hour period) to 10 total. I will plan on getting close to towns/roads in the early mornings as to not be anymore tempted to stay in town much longer than I have to, hence saving money. Get groceries. Get back to the trail. As I mentioned in a previous entry I am attempting to reach Katahdin within a 4 month time frame, therefore peeling off 6 weeks of trail time and thus a month and a half of expenses.  Groceries      - $300/month         $75/weekLodging       - $100/month         $25/weekRestaurants    - $80/month          $20/weekShower/laundry - $20/month          $when necessaryI know that injuries happen and that gear occassionally fails, so these are not rock solid numbers but I am leaving myself room to stray from this budget if it is clearly necessary. And I will be trying my best to not do that. These amounts of money are modest and I am not disillusioned by this fact. By staying in a town only once per week I can stay one night per week at a hostel and pair that with showers included, most likely sharing a load of laundry with fellow dirtbags. This budget should allow me to stay on the trail as much as possible because I will not be rolling through any of the trail/hiking festivals that many trail towns will be hosting due to how my start date lines up. I hope everyone's prep work is going smoothly....",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553104,"Moat of the past few weeks has been spent dialing in some small details and doing some minor gear adjustments. I cut out my Tyvek groundsheet and it has a really cool pattern that I happened to come across via my friend Karl. Let's just say it has a prehistoric, organic feel and look to it. I also was able to locate my old ridgerest from my Alpacka packraft that aided in the stability of the boat as well as an insulating layer for the glaciated rivers of my previous home in Alaska. I ended up cutting off a small section for a padded, insulating seat for the cold and/or uncomfortable logs, shelters, etc. I recently finished the books Skywalker and Awol on the Appalachian Trail and should be recieving Appalachian Trials any day now which talks about the mental state of thru hiking and the fortitude that it entails to keep focused on your goal of finishing the trail when times inevitably get tough. I also put together my shoebox-sized drop boxes for Natahalla Outdoor Center, Fontana, Bland, Harper's Ferry, Caratunk, and Monson. I'm not squarely depending on these boxes but will rather be supplementing freeze dried foods to mix it up and keep my diet somewhat varied. I have been enjoying reading everyone's posts on the AT class of 2017 Facebook page and have been feeling stronger in the gym with my recovery from knee surgery.

Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553545,"Greetings ladies and gents. The other morning during a walk with my brother's Australian Shepard I found myself receiving a reality check. For a total of about 45 seconds I was overwhelmed about the grand task that lie before me. My mind became rigid, frozen in a mire of fear of the unknown. After this brief feeling I shook it off and snapped out of it. Then I came back to the actual reality of the situation. I spent 17 winters in interior Alaska, camped approximately 60 nights in the Denali backcountry, trekked 250 miles across Iceland solo, hiked the first 100 miles of the Colorado Trail, etc. I have proven my meddle many times over when adversity has struck in the wilderness. Have I made silly, careless mistakes in the backcountry? Absolutely. Will I make more? Certainly. We learn from our mistakes. Often it is necessary to move forward and increase your skillset through these experiences. But these missteps are isolated islands in a sea of competence. I am capable of hiking this trail. My anxiety was rooted in fear. Not of my abilities on the trail. But of the unknown.I have no illusions about the hardships that we will all encounter throughout the 2,190 miles of our journey. During a discovery session at my local holistic center last night, I found myself sharing that I relish these times of adversity in the wilderness. You find sides of yourself that you never really get to experience in the everyday world of computer screens and traffic jams. Adversity is where our colors shine brightest. But they also have the ability to break us. My main focus of preparation for this trip will be mental. Barring injury, I will not break. I'm sure that all of us will go through this feeling of being overwhelmed with all the prep work, research, planning, and the impending failures and triumphs we will witness. There will be remarkable feats of strength and endurance (Frank Costanza would be proud) as well as heartbreaking tales of loss & despair. I believe that every human being no matter how vile, grotesque, or reprehensible, has the capacity to achieve and execute these extraordinary feats for better or for worse. In closing, if any of my fellow thru hikers feel these pangs of uncertainty and anxious remember to take a deep breath and release a slow exhale. Only 1 in 4 of us will reach Katahdin, but we are All capable. Every single one of Us......-Kyle",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553968,"    Hola, trail heads. I've been busy hitting the gym, commuting each day on foot & bicycle, and reading my ass off on a daily basis. I just finished Appalachian Trials and have started Becoming Odyssa by Jennifer Pharr Davis, the woman with the fastest known time on the AT at 46 days and 11 hours. What a beast! I was researching audiobooks and was apalled by the prices of these on Audible. Every book that I wanted was approximately $30 or more, which is a ton for a dirtbag like myself. I ended up finding a killer app called Librivox which has all the classics including, but not limited to, Wells, Thoreau, Fitzgerald, Poe, Melville, Hesse, etc. And all of these are free to listen to. What a rad service to offer the public!     I wish that I had an exact number of how many miles that have been logged while commuting since coming back to Pa after the past 17 years in Alaska. I assure you that the number is not going to break any records but it may indeed turn a few heads. After reading an article that the average American walks 1.8 miles per week, I feel blessed to not have a vehicle and I am in no hurry to get one. I have little shame in not driving. If anything, I embrace it wholeheartedly. It keeps me humble.     My knee has been swelling on humid days after my August bucket handle meniscus surgery. It certainly is a concern heading to the trail head in 7 weeks, but I've been busting my ass in a tempered and patient manner to strengthen the surrounding tendons and muscle to keep the blood flowing. All I can do is be vigilant about taking the necessary steps to get her ready and hope for the best at this point. I feel strong, but residual scar tissue may become a hassle. Either way, I'm crossing fingers, raising the black flag, and ready to start hittin' the bricks!-Kyle   ",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Mon",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554042,"Hey guys & gals, potential thru-hikers, and armchair followers of friends and loved ones who are soon to embark on trail. Enclosed is a link to an exceptional documentary on Lyme's Disease. This film delivers a powerful message that is alarming and informative, and at times heartwrenching and awe-inspiring. As a resident of Pennsylvania, I see so many of my peers and acquaintances affected by this misunderstood and misdiagnosed disease. Please arm yourself with the knowledge that this documentary allows us and be vigilant in doing everything that you can to reduce your risks of contacting this bacterium. Be forewarned that this is an extremely heavy film capable of releasing a wide array of emotions for the viewer. Once only a threat in the mid-atlantic and northern states, its range has now spread throughout the entire eastern seaboard and beyond. This may be the most important video that you end up watching in the lead up to your start date.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxK6vO8UufQThe video is shown in a smaller scale, possibly due to a copyright restriction. Nonetheless, it is a must see whether you are a thru hiker, section hiker, weekend warrior, mother, father, sister, or brother.

Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554568,"Happy Valentine's Day to you and yours! I'm about 5 weeks out from my March 23rd start date and things are going very well leading up to my the start. I'm presently researching a sleeping bag liner and I am narrrowing it down to Sea to Summit's reactor thermolite to add a handful degrees to my 35 degree bag. Also, all of my drop boxes are taped up and ready to be sent out to N.O.C., Fontana, Standing Bear, Bland, and Harper's Ferry. I will be stopping in to my home Pa for a day or so to see family and recharge around Port Clinton. More importantly, I have been thoroughly considering carrying a bleach dropper to treat all of my water. I have not filtered water in the backcountry for about 12 years here in the U.S. and feel pretty solid about not carrying a filter. I will be drinking straight from springs when appropriate and have a small backup straw for emergency situations that is extremely lightweight and effective. I know that a lot of heads will be wondering why I am taking this risk, but I am very diligent about choosing my water sources and if I have to hit some standing water then I have my backup straw. I considered using drops or a sawyer mini but, alas, I will be rolling without said tools. Again, I feel confident about this decision. I'm sure my mom wouldn't though. I'm finishing up Becoming Odyssa by Jennifer Pharr Davis and recommend the read despite it being a bit reserved in its innocent context. Next up is Robert Moor's On Trails which I have very high hopes for regarding the content of the history of trails throughout the world. If anyone would like to follow my Instagram account feel free to scope me out @bockasaurus. I will be posting a ton of my photos there along my trip, more so than here on trailjournals. I strongly encourage anyone to follow The Trek on Facebook for their articles and advice. As much I may miss my people and lifestyle that I left behind in Alaska, prepping for this trip has kept me focused and motivated for the days that lie ahead.
Lastly, I will not be choosing my own trail name which it appears that I will be a minority in that respect.But I may answer to Bockus if you see me out there in the first few weeks, or however long it takes to earn a trail name....",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555453,"Well, it's getting down to the nitty gritty. I'm hopping on my Greyhound bus to Gainesville in 19 days and feel fantastic about the possibilities that lie ahead. For one, I believe that we are all taking our trips at the most ideal time in our history to get away from the news. The effects of being bombarded with all of this ridiculousness going on every damn day is taking its toll. Timing, in that respect, could not be better. I really hope that politics is not a constant topic of conversation at shelters, in town, etc. I know that I will not be breaking the ice with any political fervor, although I feel it is our duty to at the very least follow what's going on culturally and on a human rights and humanitarian standpoint. I am going to bask in getting away from the media machine for a spell.My baseweight is continuing to drop, and will continue to do so as I head north. I'm not exactly sure what my weight is at this point but I feel very confident that it will be under 20 lbs. come start day. I sent out my first boxes to Mountain Crossings, the N.O.C., and Fontana. I will be sending out a few more packages to Standing Bear, Bland, Harper's Ferry, then nothing again until Caratunk and Monson. My drops are relatively small, coming in shoeboxes. I know that I will be happy that I sent these packages out knowing their contents. If any of you are with me when I pick up a drop, we can reap the benefits.I just blew through Grandma Gatewood's book in 3 days and it was a pleasure to read up on such a beastly character. Next on the hitlist is Kenneth Foskett's Balancing on Blue. Until my next entry, just know that any nervous energy I briefly had has since dissipated. To keep my inspiration level burning on high heat, I will be going to the Banff Mountain Film Festival tomorrow evening. Throughout my 17 years in Alaska, I had the pleasure of attending this event for about a dozen or so years at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Great memories of feeling humble amid the challenges, culture, and passion that each film entrant faced while telling their stories. Who knows, maybe I'll get called up on stage and win some swag for the first time with a winning ticket number. Stay positive, fellow trekkers!-Kyle

Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556614,"Another week down and only 5 days away from catching a 19 hour bus ride to Gainesville. I did my first true dryrun pack job and am pleased to see that my baseweight is coming in at about 19 lbs. After getting hammered with the snow storm in PA this week it has left a lot of free time due to my employment being weather dependent, which is a drag considering that I would have loved to have some extra gravy money for the trail. After seeing the effects that the storm wreaked in the NC region the decision to pack some expedition weight sleepwear has become essential. The photos that people on trail were posting looked like they were miserable, or rather, very uncomfortable. Even after 17 winters throughout Alaska's interior, I am not just shooting from the hip and hoping for the best. I am coming fully prepared for wintry conditions. Adding an extra pound or two must be deemed necessary. If carrying a bit of extra weight means restful nights and high spirits, then count me in on that bandwagon. That extra gear can be sent back home once through Roan. As the last second prep work unfolds and the sun rises and sets for another rotation, I am getting more and more stoked to set off from Springer on the 23rd.",,Necessary precautions,"Mar 16, Thu",0
Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557481,"Hey everybody. I am currently enjoying one of the finest campsites possibly on the entire trail in Georgia atop Ramrock mountain. The beginning of the trip started out amazingly at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega Georgia. The place had everything you could ask for (even Earl Shaffer's old VW bus!) and was a great spot to begin meeting fellow thru hikers. It was as clean as any hostel I've ever seen and the owners were former thru-hikers themselves about 15 years ago. I am currently hiking with a girl that I stayed with at the hostel and we are finishing our second full day together. Her name is Beth and she is from Colorado Springs and is a ton of fun to be around. The beginning of the trip was a little anti-climatic because we just kinda put on our packs and started hiking. In order to get to the true Southern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail you must get dropped off on a forest service road and must hike up a mile to see the plaque and sign a logbook and then you must backtrack a mile to get back to the road and to get to the actual it. We had a great campsite last night at 3200 ft. and enjoy the peace and quiet while reading and relaxing after 10 miles on trail. Just like that the anxiety of planning, researching, packing, repacking, explaining to friends and family about why this endeavor was important to me, the doubters, the ones who viewed this as a vacation (then you do it!), etc. all just melted away. We were here. We were on the trail! My backpack without food and water weighed in at 23 lbs. and with food and water weighed in at 32 lbs. Everyone who started the trail basically started with a pack under 40 pounds and very few were under 30 pounds but that will change as soon as we realize what we truly need and what we will discard due to wasted weight and space. I sit here it up RamRock Mountain stretching and taking in the scenery. Spring is beginning to bud on the trees but there are very few green leaves out there besides the rhododendrons. I'm excited to get a trail name and I'm also excited to give a trail name to someone at some point. I could not ask for a better hiking partner in Beth and I'm really excited for what she is doing right now with her life. As of today I got accepted as an official blogger at Appalachian Trials with the trek.com. It is the largest long distance hiking blogging site out there and I'm honored to be a part of their team. Many bloggers get 50,000+ views which is crazy to think about. I will fill you in when I am about to post my first blog on there site so I may not be updating this journal as in depth afterwards.Check out the site:https://thetrek.co/We have 1% of the trail behind us and a lifetime of memories to look forward to right in front of us.","Necessary precautions

Kickstarter ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558013,Hey guys. The trail has been treating me very well that's far. We peeled off our first 20-mile day which is very rare in Georgia. As of today I will be Crossing into North Carolina. everyone on the trails been super fun and enthusiastic. There are some real characters out here not surprisingly. All those mornings and evenings spending time at the gym are really paying off. My knee feels excellent and I feel like I already have my trail legs. We spent a night in a hotel in Helen Georgia which was probably one of the neatest towns we will see on the trail. All of the architecture was European and they had a little Bavarian Town Center. I got my trail name and I'm really happy with it period I will now be introducing myself as Kickstarter. I got the name after taking a nap at the hotel and waking up at 8:30 thinking that it was 8:30 in the morning period I started to get already with my pack put my contacts in and went outside and it was dark. So that's how I got the name and I don't have to introduce myself as Kyle anymore. My next town stop will be in Franklin North Carolina in a few days. One thing that I really wanted to say was that anyone who is hiking the trail has a lot of help from their friends and family back this is not just a one-person effort. The help with my brother and sister-in-law and mother are what makes this thing work. I hope to update this journal a little more often than I have been but adjusting to life on the trail is all that's really happening right now.

The weather has been fantastic and today it is about 80 degrees. I peeled off another 20 Miler today and will finish with 21 miles. That makes two 20-mile days in Georgia and I feel really good about that. We've only seen one storm so far and it had 50 mile an hour winds that nearly shredded are tents. My brother is sending out my two man tent because it's just too hard to maneuver in a one man tent for so many months on end.
