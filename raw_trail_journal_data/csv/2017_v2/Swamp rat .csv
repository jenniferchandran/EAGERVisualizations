Swamp rat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539814,"Black creek trailJune 24 th Janice landing to hwy 49Was dropped off by David McKenzie at Janice landing. Hiked about 3 miles in and set up camp just before dark. Took a swim in black creek and it felt so good, then I filtered water. Made a bad mistake by camping in a sandy area and I knew Better but was not thinking. I did pretty good to not be in as good of shape as I need to be, I never really became winded but did get a little dizzy from getting so hot because I pushed it to where I could get water before dark. Over all I am pleased with my performance. I will put a small wisk broom or brush in my pack to deal with dirt or sand from now on. God I believe has sent me to the trails for some reason, maybe it's just to get closer to him, but whatever it is I'm willing to follow. It is now 2006 hrs and I am laying down to get a good nights sleep. I hope I can and get a early start in the morning . God is good and I praise him for this opportunity to enjoy his beautiful wilderness. Well it's time to turn this off and get some sleep. Lights out",,Big creek landing,"Jun 24, Fri",3
Swamp rat ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539817,"Day 218 miles to Brooklyn 18 total miles for the daySlept later than I wanted to, due to the local military base blowing up things! I mean HUGE BLOW UP!!!Packed up and headed out around 0800 hrs. Trail was mostly flat and paralleled the creek for about four miles. Temp was not to bad which made for a good morning hike. Due to a blow down, I made a wrong turn at a y and climbed for about two miles before I realized I had made a wrong turn. Made my way back down the trail and arrived on the correct trail. 1200 hrs I stopped for water and a quick snack. Temp is rising fast and the trail has left the creek and hard wood bottoms, which are cool, to a long leaf open pine forest with little to no shade. 1400 hrs.stopped for a water break and snack. Began looking at the map and looks like their want be much water in the last part of the trail, which concerned me with the temp and humidity as high as they are. 1600 hrs. Stopped for water and it is so humid I am beginning to feel the affects of the heat. Eat a small snack and took a hour nap.1800 hrs. Stopped for water and studying map. Due to the fact I'm am way to hot and feel horrible , and due to the fact their is no water in the last four miles of the trail I Called my ride to meet me 20 miles into my trip.2000 hrs. Ride arrived and I left the trail . Two Big Macs and two Cokes later , I feel a lot better! Enjoyed the trip and I am pleased with my mileage for the day!!!",,Black creek trail,"Jun 25, Sat",0
