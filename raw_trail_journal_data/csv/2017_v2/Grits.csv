Very windy and few views and ran into Big Toe at Bly Gap and had lunch. Very good to be back in NC. Got to muskrat shelter and Big Toe pushed on to Deep Gap. A young lady hiking the trail from England kept us all interested in her stories from hiking in England. Still very windy and when it was time to hit the hammock. Helped a hiker set up their new hammock system. Reminds me of a hiker that wanted me to help with their new system someone had given them a few days ago. They had broken the first two rules of hammock hanging. 1. Look up for dead limbs and 2. don't hang your hammock any higher than you are willing to fall. Helped them get their system squared away and boy did it rain hard that night. Off to sleep.,"Dick's Creek

Grits,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558571,On the trail by 7:45 getting much better at having an organized camp and getting breakfast and out in the mornings. Started having some issues with blisters on my left foot and changed out the insoles and it seems to have helped. Wish I had my Oboz trail runners but these Salewa boots are great. Might have been operator error in getting them tied right. Using injinji toesock liners and darn tough socks should help with friction prevention aka blisters. Big toe made the right decision going on to Deep Creek yesterday afternoon. A family from southern Georgia had set up a camp with trail magic and he ate like a king for dinner and breakfast. This amazing family started providing trail magic in 2014 when their daughter started her thru hike. Now it seems to be A cherished family tradition. Wonderful people. Of course I had eaten breakfast less than an hour before so the best I could do was some bananas. Anyway up Standing Indian Mountain. I am 62 and met this very cool hiker from Texas that is 74 and is thru hiking. Wow I hope I am still out on the trail in 12 years. Today had turned out to be a very beautiful days and lots of views from Standing Indian. The trail is going through some of the fire damaged area and I hope things turn green before another fire hits this area. Heavy fuel load as they say in fire suppression. The trail is easy so I am going to get to the bottom of Albert Mountain so I can enjoy a beautiful sunrise tomorrow and get to the top before any haze sets in. Water source is a little sketchy for me so I treated it with aquamira my backup water treatment as well as the sawyer squeeze filter. Being trained in search and rescue it took me forever to learn to get my pack weight down because in SAR you carry a backup for just about everything as well as extra for the potential victim. But the one thing I always have a backup for is water treatment just in case. A lot of people say the sickness called norivirus is caused by bad water and yes I was not happy with one hiker I saw washing his dinner dishes in the water source. But most of the time it is bad hygiene. Wash your hands!!! Had Pack-it-Gourmet Chicken and dumplings for dinner and in the hammock by 7:30 listening to music and watching the moon rise.

I took the regular trail up Albert Mountain and it reminded me of the Daniel Boone Scout Trail up Grandfather Mountain. Rock scramble and knife edge ridge. The views were incredible. I will be posting pictures and video as soon as I can. Met Big Toe on top at the fire tower talking with two graduates from Appalachian State who were section hiking. The views were breathtaking and unless it is fogged in or icy do not ever take the bypass trail around Albert Mountain. Got good reception and checked the weather and this week looks very bad. I made the decision to come off trail till Monday till the weather improves and give my blisters time to heal. Made the 100 mile mark just north of Albert Mountain yeppe!!! Big toe decided to push on and try to get to the bed and breakfast 26 miles by tomorrow and he is a strong hiker and should make it. Trail magic by a gentleman and his grandsons at Rock Gap.

I will come back and fill in the 54.8 mile section after I complete the I-40 to Erwin section. Hikers out there I hope you button down the hatches it's going to be a wild weather week.

Into the NOC an the fire damage to the trail was scary. The fire had undermined the trail so bad one slip an it would be a body recovery.

Met a trail runner an we talked about the trail damage going into the NOC. She had heard the story from other hikers. A hiker who was injured but was following his wife was the first trail magic of the day an the 2nd was a couple from Greensboro NC who's son had thru hiked in 2014.

Drove over to Hot Springs and shuttle to I-40 thank Bluff Mountain Outfitters for making it happen. Got on the trail around 3PM and the rain was holding off. Looking south the weather in the Smoky Mountains did not look good but it was south and east of me so I felt like I might miss the worst of it. Made it to the top of Snowbird Mountain where the FAA site is and had a nice view. Some Great views. Made it to Groundhog Creek Shelter about 6 pm just as the rain started. Met a father (section hiker) daughter (thru hiker) from Ohio and they were pretty cool. Met Planner a recent Graduate of UNC Chapel Hill Nursing Program so we had a lot of basketball to talk about.

Made the 5 miles to Max Patch by 10:30 and even with so so weather the views did not disappoint. I had been here in October 2011 and had incredible fall weather and colors. anyway ate lunch at Roaring Fork shelter and some little cascade like water falls through this area. I about forgot that you could hear the traffic on I-40 from Groundhog Creek shelter most of the night. lol how far but how close things are in the Mountains. Planner caught up just as I was finishing lunch. Met a guy at Roaring fork that was drying out his tent from last night. He had his food bag hung and someone took it down when they were getting theirs down this morning and did not put it back up. Well Mr. Grey Squirrel decided to inspect the inside and had chewed up his food bag. He fixed it with duct tape till he can get into town to replace it. Got to Walnut Mountain Shelter around 2:30 and it was in the fog winds around 10 to 15 mph and raining sideways pretty good. I decided to push on to a lower camp site and get out of the high mountain weather. As time wore on my legs felt strong and there was a lot of downhill and when I got over Bluff Mountain I decided that I could make Hot Springs before or near dark and it would be a personal best of 26+ miles. I have done 23 a few times but being 62 now it was a challenge. Like Mount Mitchell it ain't flat this section assent 5960 ft. and decent 7560 ft.

So I took time to work on my gear ordered a 40 deg. top quilt and some extra shoes I might be needing them and my suspension for the hammock or course Dutch came out with something new lol. For those of you that do not know Dutch is an amazing inventor and has thru hiked the AT before and he comes up with equipment that is light weight and actually works. Dutchware.com I got the same great shuttle service from Bluff Mountain Outiftters to pick me up in Hot Springs and take me up to Allen Gap and I got on the trail by 10am and it was a good walk not a lot of steep climbs and temps in the low 50's and clean skies. Perfect hiking weather. I met the brother sister hiking team that camped with on the 2nd night at Lance Creek and had seen one time sense at rock bluff. They were doing well and having a blast. I had lunch at the Rich Mountain fire tower and you could see Mount Mitchell and the black mountain range. Most of the views there are like the the ones at other fire towers being overgrown with trees. From there it was pretty much 8 miles downhill to Hot Springs and the best veiws from Tanyard Gap into Hot Springs is at lovers leap which overlooks the river and town.

It seems like they do this every year Hamburgers Hotdogs fresh fruit potato salad coffee juice  lol I hate I missed breakfast which is even more amazing I heard from other hikers later. A big shout out to all the trail angels out there. Stopped to take pictures at Whiterock and Blackstaff cliffs. Not really much to look (here or any other overlook you don't know the names or history of the mountains you are looking at) except that two times a year the contrast is beautiful one is with the fall colors and in the spring when you can see spring slowly turning the mountains green like a wave of green flowing up the mountains.  Firescald Knob was has the best views I have seen on the trail south of here amazing 360 degree views from the plains of east Tennessee in Greene County to Mount Mitchell and the Blacks which have such an imposing view from here to Blowing Rock. The trail in about a mile section here reminds me of the Crest trail along Grandfather Mountain but not quite as rough but every bit as scenic. Then on to Jerry Cabin great water and bear cables. There is an electrical outlet here but someone forgot to pay the bill!!!! .Everyone pushed on but 4 of us because the next shelter is only 5 miles further down the trail.  One  southbounder who had got off the trail due to bad weather last December and she is almost to Springer. One southbound section hiker and myself and another north bound hiker. A quite night night and good sleep in the hammock. A full moon so it is like daylight at night.  Bear Cables are used to hang your food bag so that bears mice and other critters cannot get into your food bag. If not bear cables are available you hang your food bag in a tree (lots of fun try it!!!) Throw a rope over a tree limb 15 feet up and not get it tangled. Sleep with your food and have all the critters come belly up to the food bar well sometimes.  Bears are an issue but mice and other critters are more likely to get into your food. The third choice that I use is the ursack a food bag made out of spectra a very tough material that even bears can't tear into. So I just hang it in a tree at shoulder height.  Grits,"Allen Gap

They said that they wished they had stayed at Jerry Cabin because it was so packed at Flint they had to move further down the trail to find a place to camp. Threatening rain so I keep my bright orange pack cover on to keep the rain at bay and another good reason is that we could hear someone target practicing near the trail and it is a very visible way to let someone know that I am there. One time I was on the AT near Shady Valley  Tn. and someone was target practicing and did not know I was there and I bet I was only 50 ft. from him when he fired and I dove on the ground and the pack weight about drove me 3 feet into the ground. lol scared me, funny now but  I was not in any danger. Anyway we got to Devil's fork gap and the long climb to Hogback shelter. I think it was 2009 when I first did this section with a 55 lb. pack and I felt a lot better with just a 36 lb pack at this point but still a long hard climb at least for me. Got to Groundhog Shelter about 3 and took time to go to a creek and really clean the dirt and sweat of two days of hard hiking off. Really felt good and in the hammock resting by 8. Lots of people here and one kid from Roanoke Va. was staying in the shelter everyone else in hammocks or tents. It seems that there are two young ladies from Canada on the trail that are here and I learned later that they are somewhat celebrities on the trail from their good cheerfulness. When I was at this shelter before so many years ago there was a southbound SoBo  ultra light thru hiker that was carrying a two pound canoe paddle with him as a conversation starter so that he could say if he got up the creek at least he would have a paddle.

The young hiker from Roanoke was out ahead of me but said he was sick and threw up all night. He looked bad so I called 10-K and he said he would pick him up at Sam's Gap thank goodness. I offered to pay 10-K but he did it for free and a big shout out to 10-K and his business hikershuttles.  Funny you get to Sam's gap and the sign on the south side says welcome to Madison County NC and walk under I-23 and on the other side the sign says welcome to Tennessee. Up the mountain to the view spot looking down into street gap where on another trip I found a sign stuck on one of the white blaze posts that said that a certain Governor of a  state south of NC had been there but it was found out he was actually in South America. LOL fun memories and then as I walking down to Street gap I heard a loud crash about 50 feet below me and looked down. A BEAR wow I could not believe it at first but when he stopped and looked back at me yep it was a bear. He was gone before I could get my camera out o well. Then the climb up to Big Bald and what a perfect day for it little wind and clear beautiful sky.  I got to the top and amazing 360 degree views with Wolf Laurel down below and Mount Mitchell and the black mountains dominating the southern view was spectacular. There was one point that you could see Roan Mountain to the North East and looking down on the plains of east Tennessee as the green was beginning  to creep up the mountains. I stopped by Big Bald shelter to eat lunch and rested for 45 minutes. There were two more climbs on the way down to Spiveys Gap and as I was walking up Little bald there were small wildflowers covering the forest floor as far as the eye could see. I tried to take pictures but the pictures do not do it justice. I got over High Rocks and down to Spivey Gap at 4:30 and was passed by a slack packer going NoBo and I filtered some water for him.  When I got to No business shelter about 6:30 and 5 more miles the slackpacker about talked me into going on and night hiking into Erwin but I was to tired and there were some great places there to hang a hammock.

A great early lunch and then back to the trail. Got up to Dismal Falls trail and it was a long .3 miles off trail but it was worth it reminded me of a smaller version of some of the great swimming holes in Wilson's Creek (hunt fish falls, Gragg Prong Falls and Harper Creek falls) Great trail and it followed the dismal creek on a steady climb for about 5 miles to Wapiti shelter. Ran into another large rat snake in the middle of the trail and he was looking at me and we talked for awhile and he was having a good day sunning and catching mice. We made an agreement I would go around to the left and he would go to the right and wished each other well and off towards the shelter. Came to a pond and there were a lot of hikers there chilling out and one fishing. Now this shelter was the scene of two  horrific attacks many years ago. The first attack two  hikers lost their lives in 1981 and then years later the guy got out of prison and then attacked two fisherman both survived but the criminal died trying to escape. So the story is that the shelter is haunted and about 15 hikers moved on not wanting to camp here. Great shelter and a great location. Myself and Labman a cool guy from Germany hiking with his Labrador stayed as well as a southbounder that is doing a flip flop and a couple of more hikers. Got time to take a bath felt good to be kind of clean. In the hammock by 8 and around midnight I was awakened by something walking in the woods below my hammock camp. I had set up on the back side of the shelter away from the trail. The shelter is on a slight ridge and on the west side is the AT. At first I was not sure what it was but noises keep up of something walking up and down through the woods most of the night. With the lab in camp I was not worried about any bears or other critters coming into camp. Just made for a restless night. The answer was evident in daylight there was a game trail that deer and other animal frequently used below the shelter. No the shelter is not haunted but a sad history. The family that donated the money for this shelter was to honor their son. There is another Wapiti Shelter near Mount Rodgers Headquarters of the same name but there is a plaque there about the son and family.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Grits,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567494,I was on the trail by 7:30 am with a 1100 ft climb to Sugar Run mountain and a horseshoe shaped ridge around Wilburn Ridge leading to Pearisburg. Got to an intersection with no blazes and as the AT 99% of the time goes up I took that route for .1 mile to Dismal Peak fire tower lol wrong direction. Went back down and got back on trail. I met the 74 year old  Texan was slackpacking southbound. I had last saw him on Standing Indian Mountain in early April near the Ga border in NC. Around 11 I got to woods road near Woods Hole Hostel a well known and respected hostel in the AT community but alas I would have to skip to get to Pearisburg today. I met a couple I had met yesterday and they were slackpacking southbound again and said they were only 500 miles from completing the AT. Stopped at Doc's Knob shelter for 20 minutes for lunch. I got to a powerline and could see the New River in the distance and it starts in my home town but a lot bigger here. Made it to Pearis Ledges  by 2:30 and the view was amazing of Pearisburg and the valley below. I could feel the weight loss by this point and decided to change my strategy and would get my car and then continue up the trail slackpacking or no more than a two day walk between. It should take care of the issue as I can't seem to carry enough food. Food equals weight so it slows your millage. made a call to an amazing trail angel and was picked up in Pearisburg and home.,"Wapiti Shelter
