No Tie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557474,"Tomorrow Saturday 3/25/17 is the start of my thru hike of the AT. Living the dream. For a number of reasons, I have chosen to hike ""flip flop"" style. That means I start 427 miles into the AT and head northbound (NoBo). When I reach the top of the AT in Maine, I will return to TN and finish the AT in the southbound (SoBo) direction. I look forward to the northbound adventure during spring and summer, and also expect to enjoy the fall colors of the woods in the Smokies and the South later this year. Tomorrow, I will pick up the AT near Hampton, TN and Watauga Lake.   I expect some rain. In a few days, I will reach beautiful Damascus, VA. Ironically, AT&T has no cell coverage in the area, so my next journal entry may be from Damascus, when I pick up wifi. Keep smiling No Tie","Hampton, TN. AT mile marker 427

Monday 3/27 I hiked 8 miles to Double Spring Shelter. Beautiful night at Iron Mountain, I slept in the tent. Very soothing, got some light rain a few times throughout the night. Beautiful cool morning for hiking, I made very good time to US 91, where wonderful folks had set up a nice spread of food and drinks. That's what we call ""magic trail"" on the AT. I had a banana and an orange, as I was craving fruit. And I had a very pleasant conversation with former AT through hikers, who decided to come from far away to spread some magic trail. I lost one of my Crock camping shoes, which had fallen inadvertently when I had been getting and filtering water earlier at a stream. Luckily, my friend ""Now or Never"" was hiking half hour behind me, found the shoe and brought it to me. What a relief!!! After many hours of hiking, it is a wonderful feeling to relax your feet on a pair of Crocks. Most AT thru hikers were them. I am in great spirits. Meeting lots of great people on the trail.

Light rain, windy, cold and very foggy this morning. Great hike. I made it to Abingdon Shelter, TN around noon. I was tempted to hike all the way to Damascus, but decided to keep pacing myself and spend night here. Good weather forecast tomorrow, I should be in Damascus by noon and will enjoy the rest of the day in that gorgeous hiker town. I have met more hikers today. Jeffrey and his dog Bailey. Jeffrey is very religious, Christian, cancer survivor. He rescues abused dogs like Bailey. We had a good talk about life and God. Good man. I keep expending these mystic moments.

No Tie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558095,"3/29/17 on the ATAbingdon Shelter got very crowded last night. I wish I had tented instead. The night was chilly and foggy, but no rain. We had a beautiful day of hiking into Damascus, VA. Lots of downhill hiking on a mostly sunny day. I had two liters in the water blather, so I didn't bother to stop at the couple of springs along the way. Damascus is namely a hikers town. Most people in the stores are friendly. There is no fanfare when people see you on the street because hikers are daily appearances coming down from the mountains into hostels and inns. My hostel is run by a wonderful young lady and her mom. I have a nice private room. However, the place doesn't have wifi and at&t has no coverage in most of the town. If I stay tomorrow, I think I will switch to an inn with wifi. It's very soothing to stay connected with family and friends, mostly when in town. I have been going to Alfredo's Cafe for wifi connectivity. While there, I was delighted with my grilled chicken salad. I took the first shower and washed my clothes for the first time in five days. I can't describe how stinky I was. It's nice to feel clean again. By far the highlight of the day was meeting Now or Never's wife Cathy and his family, who invited me to an after dinner drink and delightful conversation. Truly terrific people. They have invited me to join me to bike downhill tomorrow morning. Tomorrow will be my first ""zero day"". After that, who knows. I have some thinking to do. No Tie","Adingdion Shelter, TN

No Tie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558147,"3/30/17 on the ATToday I spent the Damascus area and biked the Virginia Creeper trail. Basically, I rented a mountain bike, a van took me way up in the mountains and I biked down the trail through beautiful mountains, near the AT. There is a forecast of rain and storms all tonight and tomorrow, so I decided to stay put in Damascus. The next several days the AT will go high up to Roger Mountain and the Grayson Highlands. It will be beautiful, yet very challenging for a novel AT hiker. Tomorrow won't be a blast mostly staying in, but I really don't want to spend all day and night in the rain. If shelters are full, it will be hard to pitch a tent when one is exhausted and wet. The sun will shine on Saturday. Still smiling No Tie","Damascus, VA

I will hike with the wild horses that roam up in that area, then I will hike the 33 miles back to Damascus. So the next three days, I will be hiking southbound. Very unlikely to get any cell coverage up there, so next journal entry will be on Monday. It was nice talking to family the two days I stayed in Damascus.

No Tie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558453,"4/2/17 Happy conclusionI have decided to get off the AT. I feel very happy and satisfied. No bitterness or regrets. The experience on the AT is intense and wonderful. The connection with amazing people and an intimate closeness to God top the list for me. It is simply impossible to describe the feelings, good and tough, that like a magical recipe, have made me feel so good on the AT. Physically, the AT is extremely tough. I have enjoyed the challenges very much and have been able to handle them. I have thanked God for my good health every single step along the way. Spiritually, all the trails have always gotten me closer to God. The AT has as well. Emotionally, long distance hiking is an extreme roller coaster. I have gone from elation from all kinds of goodness I have experienced on the trail to painful sadness because I have missed Diane, the kids, rest of family and friends so much. I have always known that I am married to the love of my life and, not surprisingly, I simply don't want to be away from Diane for long periods of time. Life with her is too good to pass up. We all get on the AT knowing the risks. Some of them are trivial, some are deadly. I have had no fear for bears, mice, spiders and snakes. Nor I have feared the physical exertion. Actually, I thrive in situations that involve a degree of risk. However there are two risks that, after 8 days on the trail, I have found too high for my risk profile at this point in my life. Lyme disease is one. I have taken all precautions and have not seen a tick on me. However, I have realized that for me it was not realistic to expect that I can throughly check my body for ticks while on the trail. Simply, there is not a well lit environment on the trail. At this point in my life I don't want to assume that risk of Lyme disease. I had my first and only health scare three years ago, and I don't want to toy with major healthy problems. The other major risk for me is hypothermia. I was never close to hypothermia at all, but I have definitely felt that there is a real possibility of cold rainy nights when I wouldn't be able to secure dry shelter. I just can't assume that risk. I admit I got scared. I know my limitations and the risk of hypothermia is not worth to me. I will continue to do long hikes on the AT and other trails in the world. Thru hiking is not for me at this point. I love hiking, I love meeting other hikers and they will continue to be a big part of my life. I have met wonderful people and I have made one friend for life. Now or Never has provided me laugh, support and happiness. He is a wonderful man with a terrific family and friends. I am proud to have become one of them. I love you, Now or Never. I know we will share other trails in the future. I will return to the AT at different times and places. I will always feel a part of it. I am still smiling No Tie","Massey Gap

From Rockfish Gap, south entrance of the Shenandoah National Park, to Calf Mountain Shelter. 9 miles. 
I spent the night at a wonderful B&B in Waynesboro, VA.  Bill and Niki are a very kind couple. They made me feel very welcome to their inn. Very clean house, fantastic room with a private bathroom and a clean shower.  Waynesboro, VA is a cute small town by the Virginia mountains. I had a tasty grilled chicken cobb salad at The Green Leaf, a very nice restaurant right on Main Street. I slept like a baby. 
This morning, Bill and Niki made us a hot breakfast. I ate with two thru hikers, David and Cry Wolf, both retirees and very polite. We had a nice conversation and then Bill gave me a short drive to the AT. the other two hikers had other plans today. 
At 10:00 am, I started my hike. The day started very foggy and threatening rain. A few drops here and there, but at around 11:00am the fog cleared out and I enjoyed a very pleasant weather for hiking. Mostly cloudy, in the 60s and breezy in some parts. 
The climb is long, but not very taxing. I can tell I lost my trail legs since my last hike, and I know I will get them back in a couple of days. The forest is very dense, so I welcomed when the trees cleared so I could see the beautiful views of the Shenandoah Valley and mountains. 
I encountered several hikers along the way. I only stopped to chat with a section hiker who was on his last day of a short hike, training for his attempt to thru hike next year. We talked about the Camino De Santiago. 
I arrived at the Mountain Calf Shelter around 2:30pm. Typical Appalachian Trail shelter, but very nice tent sites. I really don't want to spend nights in shelters, so I was very happy to find a great spot for my tent. Tonight it's supposed to rain, which should continue for most of tomorrow. Let's see. Sometime the forecasts miss the mark.  One day at a time. 
In the campsite, I am with two college girls, Hanna and Amanda. Also, Jennifer, middle aged woman who just graduated last week with a masters degrees. The three of them are section hikers, heading north as well towards Harpers Ferry, WV. After I set the tent and collected water, I joined the hikers at the picnic table to eat my trail mix dinner, and they let me join their card game of Trash. We had a nice time. Very polite people. I feels great when you have good company in campsites after a long day of hiking. 
I hear that two other guys just came in and are getting set in the shelter. Often, thru hikers arrive in the evening, as they cover many miles in their long hiking days. 
Like I mentioned before, the forecast for tomorrow is rain most of the day. I will decide what to do in the morning. 
Like in past hiking experiences, I felt very close to God on the trail. I prayed, I had very calming thoughts, and overall I was comfortable and at ease, even though the 4.5 hours today was physically challenging. 
I am happy and still smiling.

From Calf Mountain Shelter to Blackrock Shelter, VA. 14 miles. 
Things worked perfectly today. Last night there were short periods of rain, but it stopped by the morning. I got up at 5:15am, and left camp at 6:45am. The temperature was cool, but pleasant for hiking. Although there was a forecast of intermittent rain, I chose not to wear the rain gear. That proved to be a great decision. Rain was mostly light and my body heat kept me dry for the most part. Had I been wearing the rain gear, I would have been drenched with perspiration. Sometimes, particularly when the temperature is comfortable, I am better off not using a rain jacket on the hike. I learned that before. 
The trail is very well maintained in the Shenandoah National Park. Although the forest is very thick and dense, occasionally I enjoyed spectacular views. This is a beautiful part of the country indeed. Just gorgeous. 
The wild flowers were simply spectacular. I think they were mainly laurel flowers, but there was quite a variety. The flora was really awesome!!!
The trail had quite a few ups and downs. While none of them were killers, I certainly found the up hills moderately challenging. When I got very tired on seemingly endless ascends, I would smile and thank God for the opportunity to lose some of the pounds I want to shed. In anticipation of a long AT thru hike, I purposely put on some weight a few months ago. Now I need to lose them. So give me more mountains. I can handle them and I certainly don't need to extra weight. 
I encountered a few hikers. Short conversations at times, and everyone was very nice. I am noticing that the young AT thru hikers are very rushed. They really don't seem to be having much fun. Section hikers tend to take more time to stop and chat. They seem to be enjoying the hike. I really like that feeling myself. As a section hiker, I don't feel the stress I felt during my short ""career"" as a thru hiker. I don't want my hiking to feel like a race.  I don't do that anymore. 
Blackrock Shelter and camp is very clean and comfortable. I got here around 2:00pm and I chose a good tent site. Young hikers were here having lunch, and they were eager to hike several more miles. Nice young kids. 
Tonight, I am with good company. Jennifer, Hannah, Amanda and Alex from last night. Also, Drew and his pretty dog Hannah. Very nice group. 
It is raining hard now, and I am hoping it stops for a minute before it gets dark so I can step out of my tent quickly and hang my food bag in the bear pole, which is very convenient. No need to throw a line over a high branch to hang the bag, like I did in TN. 
I had nice prayers along the way, thanking God for all the blessings in my life. My family, friends and health are at the top of my long list. I also laughed along the way several times, as I was coming up with ideas for book story. I better take some notes before I forget. 
I am very happy, looking forward to seeing family and friends in a couple of weeks.  And yes, I am still smiling.

From Blackrock Shelter to Pinefield Shelter, VA.  14 miles. 
Last night rained steady most of the night. At around 5:30am, the rain slowed to a light mist. It was a sign for me to get up. It was the first time that I had to pack my wet tent, so it took me longer than usual. Nevertheless, I did a fine job and I was very proud of myself. At 7:30am I was on the trail. 
The trail headed straight and steeply upwards to the top of Blackrock mountain. The top of the mountain is very rocky with very large black rocks and it was spectacular.  The views must have been amazing, but all I could see was fog. 
The morning was cold, misty and windy, so I wore my rain jacket, mostly got the wind. After one hour, I took it off. Although it rained most of the long hike, I managed to mostly keep my clothes relative dry.  Body heat is a very efficient  dryer.  My socks got wet, as one would expect, but it didn't feel bad. 
Hannah and Potato Chips passed me within an hour into the hike. They were in a hurry because their tent took in water during the night and their sleeping bags and clothes got wet. They had a miserable night. Amanda had mentioned at camp the night before that she couldn't wait to get to the upcoming wayside (as they call a store within SNP) to get potato chips.  That was it. I thought it was funny and I gave her a trail name accordingly. 
I hiked up several mountains and passed overlooks with views. Again, all I could see was fog. Oh, well...
I prayed several times today. It just comes naturally to me when I hike. Walking often puts me in a ""good thoughts zone"". 
I was enjoying my hike. The forest takes a magical aspect in the rain.  I had a slow but stray rhythm, so I didn't feel like getting off the trail half a mile to the wayside/store/restaurant. I don't have a lot of food left, but enough for a couple of days and I don't need the extra weight in my backpack.  I will resupply the day after tomorrow. 
I encountered several hikers. Good Tunes, a NoBo thru hiker, passed me a couple of times. He said I didn't miss much at the restaurant. Luke and Nico passed me at a parking trail head. They are hiking for the week. Nice guys. For the most part, all hikers were very nice today on the trail. 
I arrived at the Pinefield Shelter by 2:30. I quickly secured a good site and pitched my tent right away. The rain was light and I knew it would get stronger. While I was pitching the tent, Luke came to tell me that he and Nico made extra soup so I could have some. I went down to the shelter and indeed had a bowl of delicious soup. The first warm food in three days. Yum!!! They left because they wanted to cover more miles today. Youths. So much energy!
I finished eating and hung my bag in the bear pole. I spoke briefly with other hikers who are either staying in the shelter or stopping for a quick bite. I came up to my tent and got myself dry and warm. I hope the storms are not too bad tonight. 
Tomorrow is supposed to rain hard during the morning. The next shelter is only seven miles, and I hope I get the chance to pick up and go to the next stop. If rain is horrible and my tent is dry, I may take a zero in camp. 
I miss family and friends. I am happy and still smiling ;)

From Pinefield Shelter to Hightop Shelter, VA. 9 miles. 
Last night was pouring rain all night. I had no cell signal, so I didn't know what to expect for today's weather. I figured that, if the hard rain would continue during the morning, I might stay put. 
The rain stopped around 6:00am. I got up and got ready to hike to the next shelter, and hoped there wouldn't be more heavy storms. The outside of the tent was very wet, and I didn't leave camp until 8:00am today. 
The trailed reached  three mountains' summits today. The fog cleared at times, so I got to enjoy some beautiful views. The weather was constantly changing from fog to mist to rain to sun, and back to rain. Luckily, no heavy storms. 
Hannah and Potato Chips left camp early because they were trying to hike twenty miles. I encountered a few hikers, and simply exchanged polite hellos. Young hikers are much faster than me and they passed me in a rush. A frequent reminder that I am an old guy. Well, I am just happy to be healthy and able to endure these hikes up and down the mountains. Jennifer left soon after I did, and she caught up to me right as I was arriving at Hightop around 2:00pm. She is tenting here as well, and I just heard other hikers arriving to the shelter. I enjoy my time in my tent, dry and comfy. It's 5:30pm, I already had dinner, hung my food bag and I am in my dry clothes. It feels so comfy!!!!!!  Did I mention I am an old guy?
I haven't seen a bear yet, but I did find a big pile of fresh scat right in the middle of the trail. It definitely was fresh, so just in case I started to make loud noises by banging my poles and yelling. I am sure I sounded like a weirdo, but I wanted to let the bears know I was nearby. Better safe than sorry. 
Tomorrow, I have planned a 13 mile hike. I do need to stop at a SNP camp store along the way because I am running low of food. I am happy eating trail mix and haven't missed my stove at all. I will enjoy hot food when I get to civilization soon enough. 
By the way, I have been exchanging texts with Now or Never. I miss him too. During today's hike, I decided to change his trail name to Now and Always.  He recently got off the AT, and I know we will always find opportunities to share a hike together here and there, thus the more fitting name. We have a good friendship. The trail does that to hikers. 
Good prayers along the hike, along with good thoughts and more interesting ideas for a story. I miss my family and friends more than anyone can imagine. 
Certainly, I am still smiling ;)

No Tie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567103,"5/26/17 on the Appalachian Trail 
From Hightop Shelter to Lewis Mountain Camp, VA. 13 miles. 
Last night got very cold and windy. Luckily, no rain, for a welcome change. I got up at 5:15 am because of the frequent rain for the last few days, once again I had to put on wet socks and clothes. That part is one of the most unpleasant parts of hiking the Appalachian Trail. I am kind of glad that I experienced it, but I am not a big fan of it. 
Less than ten yards from my tent, I found a fresh big bear paw print in the mud. I took a picture of it. Another reminder that bears are in fact around camps, so it is very important to hang all edibles and smelly items in a proper branch or a bear pole. To that point, a few nights ago, I was comfortable in my dry clothes and sleeping bag. It was already getting dark and it was rainy. Suddenly, I realized I had left a small ziplock bag of trail mix in my backpack's top drawer.  I considered for just a minute to take the chance, and then I thought better and decided to go place the little bag in my food bag.  Take off dry clothes, put on a rain jacket and walk in the rain to the bear pole, retrieve my food bag and placed the little ziplock inside the smell proof food bag. I am glad I took the precaution.  Bears are real danger out there in the Appalachian Trail. 
The day was mostly cloudy and windy, but no fog. Therefore, I actually got to see a few spectacular views from up the mountains. The great majority of my time hiking on the AT, I have been hiking in a ""green tunnel"", which makes it cry monotonous. Very few times you get to see panoramic views on the AT. 
The trail was very wet today, big puddles or rivers coming down. My feet were very wet. In spite of it, I enjoyed the hiking. And yet, I knew that the level of satisfaction was dropping fast.  I had the same feelings when I hiked to Damascus a couple of months ago. 
Rather than getting stressed about it, when I passed a campground very closed to my scheduled destination, I decided that it was time to get off and get back to civilization. It was 2:00pm afternoon, and a good time to end my hike for the day and for my Shenandoah adventure. 
Good to be back in civilization. I am going to explore DC. lots of walking and I won't miss the 35 lbs on my back. 
Still smiling ;)
