Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562494,"Car is loaded and hopefully nothing has been forgotten. I'm heading north, leaving the increasingly hot weather in Florida behind and heading to the Shenandoah mountains in Virginia to work on finishing off the areas of the AT  that I left undone last year.  First stop though is Wilmington, NC. I found out at the last minute that my son is there working for the week and we will be able to connect for dinner. I am beyond excited to see him once more before he moves across the country.The drive was uneventful, save for all the crazies on I-95 and Snowbirds, leaving Florida in a mass migration, hauling impressive RVs.",,View Entry,"Apr 29, Sat",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562498,"I headed out early, destination Front Royal. I thought driving on a Sunday would be a piece of cake, but the road was a busy place. It struck me that the speed limit signs must just be a suggestion, because everyone was blasting down the highway at 80 mph or faster. Whew.  I really prefer travelling by golf cart!  Making good time, I decided to take a couple of back roads and soon found myself winding through the east side of the mountains. It was just gorgeous, the green fields, all sorts of bushes blooming in a riot of colors and the mountains in the background. I kept thinking soon, soon Wild Thang and I will be up on that ridge hiking!Tomorrow our hike begins.  I have wanted to return to the trail to try and finish off the state of Virginia since I left abruptly last June. I figured I would just go to the spot I got off the trail and start hiking north to Front Royal, VA.  When Wild Thang heard of my plans, she wanted to join me, as she had not yet hiked more than 8 days at a time. When we sat down in March to plan the trip, I was thinking we'll just get on the trail and march north. But then, Wild Thang began to insert a ""what if"" and a few ""how about thats"" and before I knew what had happened, we created an incredible feat of logistics of ""leapfrogging""!!!  We each have our cars and we will hike through the Shenandoah's slackpacking ourselves!!   It was a logistical nightmare establishing parking and moving cars, but absolutely worth it to carry only a daypack each day.  I can hardly wait to see how our hike unfolds!  Stay tuned.....",,View Entry,"Apr 30, Sun",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563194,"Our daypacks loaded, water bladders filled, we deposit one car at the trailhead on Rt 522 and then  begin the uphill trek onto Skyline Drive, aiming for a specific parking spot at mile marker 14.2. The AT crosses the Drive at this point and hiking back to the first car would give us a 9.9 mile day.  Unsure of the legality of said parking spot, which was all grass, we continued south to the next paved area, complete with signage. This must be right!  After  double and triple checking to make sure we had the car keys, we set off, hiking northbound.
Right off the bat, it is uphill and Wild Thang and I are thrilled to be wearing 8 pound daypacks instead of 28 pound backpacks!  Up, up, up we go and I start thinking this isn't right. Our starting location had us climbing a little bump and the rest of the day was downhill.  Leading the way, I follow the trail straight into a rock face and see no signs of markers. Huh?  There is a well worn rocky path climbing up the side of the face, so up I go.  Getting to the top, I still don't see any blazes, and begin to wander trying to find the correct trail. Obviously people have been here, as there are paths all over, and some nice views, but it is definitely NOT where we should be. Wild Thang pulls out her phone and looks up our location on GutHook's  map, and no surprise, we are way off trail. Turning around and backtracking I see where I missed a sharp left turn, that was not marked! Back on the right track, we keep climbing.  All this in just the first hour of hiking!
Finally the descent begins and we coast along enjoying the scenery.  Not many views, but the wildflowers are starting to bloom, and the azalea bushes are pretty with their pink or white blooms. The dogwood is out as well, adding more white to the otherwise drab background. At this elevation, the trees are just starting to bud, so there is more brown than green to meet the eye.  After stumbling and tripping  through the first mile or two, my feet and legs begin to remember how to hike and my stride smooths out.  We arrive at our first Skyline Drive crossing (the trail crosses the Drive numerous times) and discover we are at Hogwallow Gap parking area. What? That was where we were supposed to start!!  Oh no, we inadvertently just added 2 extra miles to our first day's hike. Not a smart thing to do.  Too late to correct, we proceed, our spirits deflated. 
The weather is changing and clouds are moving in as we progress. Wild Thang is having some feet issues, blisters maybe, and we are both tired. As we close in on Compton Gap we begin to discuss bail out points and getting a ride to the car, to save our feet and beat the rain. Because I had been in this area last year  I was familiar with a nearby hostel/shuttle and offered to call him.  At our next break, I fired up my phone and called, only to find out that Mike was already out, shuttling hikers way south towards Pearisburg and wouldn't be back until 6:30. His advice was ""keep hiking, it's all downhill anyway and try to beat the storm""!  Sigh.
Nothing to do but follow his advice.  We took a quick break at the Tom Floyd Shelter for a snack, said hello to a southbound hiker who was setting up for the night, and continued on.  The trail was kind, but my knees were aching from all the downhill, no matter that it was smooth. I was about 5 minutes ahead of Wild Thang, so I opened up the car  and got my boots off, ahhhhh!  Wild Thang rolled in and I handed her a cold Gatorade. It felt so good to sit down on something comfortable. After a few minutes of recovering, we headed back to Skyline Drive to fetch the other car. This required going through the Gate again.
 I pull up to the booth, stop, and tell the young Ranger that we are just going up to retrieve a car (it costs $25.00 per car to enter the Shenandoah National Park. We both have Access passes, so it is free ).  He asks me for my pass. I tell him  ""it is in my pack, way in the back of the car and that I cannot possibly climb out , walk back there and get it because we just hiked ungodly mileage with two extra miles, because of poor signage and my stupidity so I just can't move. If he really needs it, he will have to get it for me"". Well, he didn't quite know what to make of that. Heck, it is almost 6 pm and the park closes anyway, but I know that is not the point. The point was, I just couldn't move without a lot of pain. Meanwhile, Wild Thang, being her usual helpful self, was laughing and shaking her head. The nice Ranger relented, seeing that we were two ""mature"" women, worn to a frazzle, and we assured him we would show him our pass tomorrow. After all, we had shown it this morning to leave the car up there and hike down. Up we went into the fog and rain to find the car, back down again and raced to the hotel, stopping only to buy some Epsom Salts. It was brilliant to spend tonight in a place with a bathtub. I am happy to be warm and dry, even if I ache all over!
Lesson learned:  always use GPS coordinates to locate the correct parking spot. After all, AWOL puts them on his maps for a reason!!!!","Mile 957.5

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563249,"I could barely move this morning when I woke up. They say it doesn’t pay to get old. I say it just plain hurts sometimes!  We gathered up our things and checked out of the hotel. The best way to work that lactic acid out of the muscles is to use them again, so let’s go hike!

As I approached the gate at the Park, I was prepared with my Access pass in hand. I pull up to the booth; the same young Ranger is there. I greet him with a cheery “Good Morning, look what I have in my hand!” He nods good morning, smiles and asks me for my ID as well. I just looked at him and told him that while I had taken great pains to have my pass in hand; my ID was in my wallet, in my daypack, WAAAY in the back of my car. We both laughed. As I was struggling to get out to go fetch it, another Ranger (who appeared to be about my age) says “so this must be the ‘recidivist’ you were telling me about! I knew I had heard that term, knew it was not a compliment, but agreed that I was she! (Later I looked it up: a convicted criminal who reoffends, especially repeatedly.)  Ha! Maybe a little strong, since I have not been convicted!!  We chatted a bit about our hiking plans for the day, got information about campgrounds, open and closed, and went on our way.

Today we are headed for Elkwallow Wayside parking area. There are restrooms here as well as a café and souvenir shop. We will hike from here north to where we mistakenly parked yesterday. The good news is that today’s hike is even shorter than planned, thanks to yesterday’s being longer than planned!

It all works out in the end.  I had hiked part of this section last year so I was especially interested to compare how I felt about the terrain today as opposed to last year.  It sure was fun to recognize where we were going, and I was able to tell Wild Thang where the good views were, where there was really good footing, etc. I felt like a tour guide!  We climbed up to 3400 feet today (from 2480’) to Rattlesnake Point and the Tuscarora Trail junction. Great views up here and I took a picture overlooking the valley (posted on tomorrow’s page).  The trail ambles along the ridgeline with a good view here and there. About 5 miles in, Wild Thang’s feet really began to bother her. We stopped at Little Hogback parking area and she decided she would wait there, resting her feet while I continued on the last two miles to the car. We formulated an emergency plan in case of injury or weather change, and I set off down the trail.  It was easy hiking and I was making good time. It was hot and I began to get concerned about whether I had enough water to get me to the car. I really didn’t want to take the time to stop and filter water, keeping WT waiting even longer.  I thought about going to Gravel Springs shelter as I passed by, but it was 0.2 mi off the trail. I kept going and in 0.2 mi I hit the Gravel Springs parking lot. As I was passing through, I notice two women, getting their packs ready, about to hit the trail. I said hello, and asked if they had any spare water. They gladly gave me a small bottle and we chatted for a minute. Both from New Jersey, Mad Hatter and Jersey Jane are out backpacking for a week, heading sobo. As I said goodbye, I added “see you on the trail”.  Little did I know how right I would be!

Next up was a bit of a climb, so I was glad for the extra water. One more mile and I came around a corner and there was the parking lot with my car. Made it, with water to spare! Drove back to find WT and we retrieved her car from its parking spot. Big Meadows campground was to be our home for the night, and we were both looking forward to hot showers. It took time to look around to find the perfect spot to accommodate our hammocks. Once set up, hunger hit as it was past dinnertime. It sure is nice having the cars here to haul excess camping gear along, like comfy chairs. It was getting dark as I headed to the row of shower rooms. I chose one, turned on the light, got everything set up and put my $1.75 worth of quarters in the machine, plink, plink, plink. I reach over and turn on the water, and nothing happens. I find a button on the quarter machine, press it and nothing happens. This is not looking good.  There is no water, I am not able to make the machine cough up my quarters and I am cold standing there in my birthday suit. Nothing can be done about it, so I get dressed, return to the campsite and go to bed. Tomorrow is another day……","Elkwallow Wayside

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563250,"Last night was beautiful, clear with lots of stars. The moon shone through my new cuben fiber tarp and lit up the inside. I had to keep pulling my hat down over my eyes to block out the light. WT and I discussed the plan for the day over breakfast and tea (coffee for her). She is very uncomfortable due to her foot and need to minimize her mileage today. That is fine with me because my whole body is sore and tired.  A short day will give us a chance to hike a little, rest and eat and get some laundry done.
Today we parked one car at Beahm’s Gap overlook and one at Thornton Gap, US 211. Starting at Beahm’s Gap, elevation 2490’, we hiked downward to the parking area just past Thornton Gap, US 211. (2323’ elevation). The trail took us up Pass Mountain on a nicely graded trail. There wasn’t much to see along the way but some wildflowers, a turkey, a pileated woodpecker and a black snake I almost stepped on!  The song birds were plentiful, especial the wood thrush. I just love hearing their song. This section had great footing, lots of pine needle covered trail, and is enjoyable hiking, almost easy! It wasn’t long before we crossed US 211 and headed for a short uphill to the parking lot.  
Since the hike ended so quickly, it left time to add lunch to our list of chores. We found our way to the Skyland Resort and Restaurant, got seated at a table looking out west at the mountains and ordered a huge hot lunch, complete with dessert. Yum!! Now we can avoid having to cook dinner. We lingered quite a while until we noticed that they were starting to set up for dinner service. It was time to head back to the campground. WT started the laundry while I chased down an employee to refund my ill-fated shower money from last night. I also reported the non-working shower and was delighted to be shown that there is a heated bathroom containing two showers in the laundry building. Who knew? After gathering up some clean clothes, shower supplies and baggie of quarters, I chose the roomiest shower.  Again, I got everything set up, shampoo, etc. in place, birthday suit on, and began to ply the machine with quarters. I couldn’t even get one to go in! I pressed the return button and someone else’s quarter rolled out. I tried again. No luck, the machine was completely jammed. Feeling a bit frustrated, and knowing I was in the Ladies room, I just grabbed my soaps and towel and dashed to the second shower, praying it would work.   Voila! Out sprayed hot water and lots of it. These coin operated showers only last 5 minutes and how time flies when there is hot water to enjoy. The rest of the evening was spent puttering around, reorganizing the car, daypack and sundries. I also walked around the campground a little to try and keep my muscles from tightening up. The temperature dropped off rapidly so I headed to my snug, warm hammock to read………….","944.4 Beahm's Gap Overlook

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563332,"I didn’t feel like I was sleeping much last night. My body felt relaxed and comfortable.  Even though I wear earplugs to shut out the forest noises, my mind was still busy and couldn’t calm down.  All of a sudden, I heard this loud snort! It was the kind of noise a bear would make. I quickly took out my earplugs to hear better and began sniffing the air (I have been told that you can always smell a bear before you see it). I smelled nothing unusual, and I could hear nothing moving outside, it was dead quiet. As I calmed my racing heart, I started laughing.  I realized it was me snorting!  I guess I was actually asleep when I woke myself up snoring. These are the kind of crazy things that happen to hikers in the woods! You scare yourself silly just being human. Who needs bears to do it for you?

The temperature had dropped to about 39 degrees. The wind was blowing so much it had uprooted one of my tarp stakes and that side was flapping noisily. Reluctantly, I left the warm cocoon of my hammock to fix it and took stock of the weather. It was going to be difficult to sit at the picnic table to cook breakfast, too cold and windy. I could cook sheltered in the tailgate of my car, but that would still be cold. Looking around, I had a brilliant idea. I gathered up my clothes, stove, food and marched up to the laundry building. Open 24 hours a day, heated and with bathrooms. Who could ask for more! I set up on the folding table in the laundry room and started boiling water for tea and oatmeal. While that was brewing, I used the heated bathroom to clean up and change into warm clothes. Then I enjoyed my breakfast and tea, warm and toasty, staring at the beautiful scenery of washing machines. But I was warm!

It took Wild Thang a while to get going, as she thought I was still lounging in my hammock. Once up, she breakfasted in the laundry room as well and we drew up the plan for the day.  The weather is calling for severe thunderstorms late today and tomorrow. Sounds like hotel weather to me! Her foot was very painful so she decided not to hike at all today. We came up with a plan that would allow me to hike the last little bit that I needed to complete the northern third of the Shenandoah while she was to go into Front Royal and secure us hotel rooms for two nights.  We packed up in no time and hit the road.

After dropping my car off at Beahm’s Gap we continued on to Elkwallow Wayside.  WT dropped me off and we review my hike plan, timing and “what if’s”. She drove off and I headed sobo downhill. The day was cold, in the 40’s most of the day. Fortunately I spent most of the day on the leeward side of the mountains so I was out of the wind.  The first climb was up out of Elkwallow about 400 feet up. Then the trail plateaued and I moved along quickly. I met some day hikers and a few thru hikers, who had started in late February. They reported that they are ahead of the big hiker bubble and that the Noro virus is rampant, much like last year I suspect. Checking the map, I saw I had a nice long descent ahead followed by a short, steep uphill to Beahm’s Gap. Along the way I met Tornado, another thru hiker. I questioned him about his hike. He is keeping a journal online, which I read when I got back to civilization. Check it out, he writes well and it is enjoyable reading!   There was not much to see today as I was hiking along the side of the mountain. The trail was strenuous and rocky as I climbed up the last part to the Gap, but I knew it was short. Suddenly I popped out of the woods into a parking lot and there was my car. What a wonderful sight!  Because I did this hike fast (for me), probably averaging 2 mph, I took time to stretch after I got my boots off. Then I walked around the parking lot to read the information sign about the Gap while I cooled off. I was undecided which direction to travel to get to Front Royal. I could go a short 8 miles south on Skyline to pick up US 340 or wind and curve my way north directly on Skyline Drive. I chose to go south.

As I am pulling out of the parking lot, I see someone standing by the side of the road, at the trail crossing. I pulled over and asked if everything was ok, and did they need anything? It turned out to be one of the two women I met yesterday¸ Jersey Jane!  Behind her, Mad Hatter was making her way uphill to join her. They said they were going to call the hostel in Luray for a ride (because of incoming weather). I was going that way, but only had room for one. Then I remembered that they had a car up here at Gravel Springs and offered to turn around and give one of them a ride to their car. Then they would have the freedom to go where they wanted, and move their car closer to their hiking section. Brilliant! So that is what we did. Mad Hatter threw her pack in the car, we made sure JJ had what she needed to be warm and dry and we headed north on Skyline. After dropping her off at the Gravel Springs parking area, I continued north, winding my way on Skyline. As I approached Hogwallow Gap parking, I saw a hiker with a prosthetic leg standing by the side of the road looking out of sorts. I pulled over and asked him if he needed a ride to town. He told me his prosthetic leg was not fitting correctly and was terribly painful. He needed to go to Gravel Springs parking area. The shelter is only 0.2 mi from the parking area and he was going to spend the night there. A friend was then driving up tomorrow to pick him up, take him to Fredericksburg to get his prosthesis adjusted. I told him I just came from there, but said what the heck, hop in and I will take you back there. He climbed in, introduced himself as Kickstand, and off we went. He is doing a flip flop thru hike. Starting in the Shenandoah close to home gave him a chance to work out any issues with his new prosthesis. His plan is to go home for a couple of weeks while the blisters heal, get the prosthesis adjusted and get back to the trail. Amazing, isn’t it?
 Now it was time to take care of myself. Turning around, heading north and downhill all the way, I made it to the hotel in record time. A hot shower and a cup of tea hit the spot. What a great day it","Elkwallow Wayside

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563333,"Coming into town for a night inside was the right decision. It poured on and off all night and there is lots of flooding in surrounding areas.Taking a zero day gives the body time to rest, and a chance to reorganize, clean out packs and eat restaurant food.  So that is what I did all day. I never even stuck my head outside, although I did sit by the open window, working on this journal, watching the rain. But I must say, by the end of the day, I was starting to get antsy about getting back to the trail. That is a good sign!","

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563419,"Oh boy, it is still raining. Sigh. Wild Thang left for her appointment with the podiatrist. I did more journal editing and waited for the weather to clear. It was my intention to go out a hike a section, but I just couldn't get past the rain. I frittered away the morning until WT called and said she was on her way back and was ready to go hike.  I sprang into action, assembling gear, getting hiking clothes on and planning a short hike to Mary's Rock, one of the highlights of the AT.  After checking various mileage from a variety of points, I found we could easily do Mary's Rock by leaving one car at Panorama parking and driving to the Meadow Springs  trailhead parking. Then it is a 0.6 hike uphill to the AT, 0.6 to Mary's Rock and 1.7 down to Panorama. Perfect for a rainy day.Heading for Luray, the sky began to lighten and the rain slowed to a drizzle. The temp is low 50's and a light wind is blowing. Up we went to Skyline Drive and as we got to the parking lot, the temp dropped to 46 degrees. Brrrr. There were lots of cars in the parking area which surprised me, given the weather.  As we ascended, we passed groups of people hiking up to the top.  Apparently  this is a popular area!  On the way, I met a thru hiker and asked how her hike was going. She (age 60) had started in Rockfish Gap, with her mother (age 80) along to keep her company  to Skyland Resort area. Her trail name is Nemophilist; she has a journal at trailjournals.com as well.  Her mother's trail name is Frolicking Dinosaur!  I thought that was great and was so impressed that her mother was out backpacking at age 80. Wow. I was sorry not to have met  her.Mary's Rock is at 3462 feet and is a huge rocky outcropping. We stayed a little while taking pictures, but the wind made it really cold, so I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Heading downhill, the trail was rocky and wet which made it slow going.  I finally got to the bottom and my knees couldn't thank me enough!  It felt so odd walking on pavement to the car!  Ever grateful to climb in the car and turn on the heat, we headed back up the mountain to retrieve the other car before returning to the hotel. This is our last night here. Tomorrow we will head back into the mountains tackling areas between Luray and Rockfish Gap. I probably won't have good reception, so it may be a few days before I post again.  In the meantime, thanks for following along!","941.2 Panorama RR parking

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563484,"I peered out the window this morning and much to my delight there was no rain! I had tea and cinnamon buns for breakfast in my room while I packed up. Today we are headed backup on Skyline Drive south of Luray. We stopped at the Meadow Springs parking area to drop off a car and then continued on to the Pinnacle parking area which is the large picnic area complete with fire rings, picnic tables and best of all real restrooms!  It’s early and the day is windy and cold, in the 40's, yet there are many families here setting up to spend the day, grilling hamburgers and hot dogs. While the little kids run amok, the teenagers are all crammed into a minivan playing on their phones. Their grownups are oblivious, perhaps numbed by the cold and focused on getting the food cooked and set out.  An interesting dynamic! 
 We bundled up, complete with hat and gloves, threw our day packs on and located the AT as it traverses next to the parking lot, then descends down off the ridge, heading northbound.   We hike across a meadow-like area, Jewell Hollow, where the views down into the valley are spectacular. Two ravens entertain us rising, swooping and falling as they ride the air currents. It’s time to move on and tackle our challenge for the day:  climbing The Pinnacle, elevation 3730’.  The climb begins, taking us over pine needle covered trail until there are more rocks than needles to navigate. Finding suitable rocks for seats, we stop for a snack and chat with other hikers passing by. It’s the weekend and the trail is a busy place.

There are beautiful views off to the west of the valley and mountains in the distance. We hiked slowly taking advantage of all of the viewpoints as well as stopping to identify the wild flowers that are starting to bloom. I spotted a Trillium growing on the  slope,  protected on the west side. Then we started seeing more of them, in spots protected from the cold and wind. There are azalea bushes surrounding the trail, but none in bloom yet at this elevation (3730'). Moving along, we thread our way downward towards Byrds Nest #3 hut, built by the Civilian Conservation Corp back in the 30’s.  It is a nice big 3-sided shelter, made of stone. It even has a big fireplace inside. Unfortunately, the open side faces west and that means the cold wind and bad weather blows right into the shelter. Brrr. One hiker, who had spent a cold night here, said the wind was so strong it tore up the tarp they had tied across the opening. Between cold wind and mice, I prefer my hammock, hands down! There is a bit of hiking on an old forest service road before the trail turns upward, the climb culminating at Mary’s Rock (where we were yesterday). Meadow Springs trail appeared in no time and we made our way down it 0.6 miles and back to the car. As usual, at the end of a hike, the talk turns to food!  We had to pick up the other car, drive south to Big Meadows Campground, but lo and behold, what happened to be located conveniently between the two? Why, Skyland Resort and Restaurant, of course. Let’s see, if we have a late lunch, we won’t have to cook dinner and eat ugh, backpacking food, right? The decision was unanimous, and I must say, that was the best Turkey Pot Pie I have had in a long time. Not being known for my ‘lady-like’ appetite, I even managed to polish  off a blackberry cobbler for dessert. The restaurant overlooks the valley and the mountains to the west so it was difficult to tear ourselves away from the vistas, but we needed to get to the campground and get set up. It was looking like rain was headed our way.
We checked in, found a suitable campsite for hanging a hammock and setting up a tent.Just as we started unpacking, doesn’t it begin to rain, which then turned to sleet. That’s right, sleet. Jumping back into our cars, we waited it out, with heaters running. I was not prepared for below 40 degree weather, and I was starting to worry about staying warm tonight. It is supposed to drop into the 30's. The storm passed and I raced to get my tent up, sleeping pad inflated and sleeping bag fluffed, plus everything I would need for the night.  Hiker midnight (8 pm) is approaching. Time to climb in and read a bit, wishing I had 2 more sleeping bags and 3 dogs for warmth!","Pinnacle picnic parking area

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564701,"Oh boy was it cold last night. Trying to hibernate in my tent was definitely not warmer than being in my hammock. Sometime after midnight, as I was thrashing around on my noisy sleeping pad, Wild Thang asked if I was ok. I replied that I was freezing and asked where the nearest hotel room was!  She kindly brought over two hand warmer packets (this camper was:  a. too cold and  b. to lazy to get up and rummage through her car to find her own).  After tearing them open and shaking them to activate, I put one in the foot of my sleeping bag and the other I clutched to my core.  That seemed to do the trick and I fell asleep.

The day dawned sunny and yep, still cold.  Nonetheless, it was time to get up and get going.  Fortunately my fuel canister behaved well in spite of the temperature and fired up immediately. Soon my tea was made, oatmeal cooking and I stayed toasty warm wrapped in my sleeping bag.  That is something I am loathe to do (having my sleeping bag anywhere near food, think BEARS!), and I took extra care not to spill oatmeal on it.  Breakfast was a hurried affair instead of the leisurely mode I prefer. Getting dressed in a tent is always a challenge as is putting on cold clothing.  But who needs to struggle with that when our base camp provides a heated bathroom with hot running water! Thank you Big Meadows!

Today we would be hiking sobo (southbound) from Skyland Resort, so we only had to take one car.  We parked at the lot next to the stables. Being excellent procrastinators, we decided to check out the horses and trail riding first. Secondary to that was the hope they had a restroom!  We met two nice young people who run the stables with whom we discussed prices of the trail rides and the horses. There were about 8 stalls on each side of the central paddock. Each stall had a double Dutch door opened onto the paddock. Every single horse was looking out its stall door at us while we talked. It was as if they were saying “choose me, choose me”!  We were sorely tempted to nix the hiking for the day and ride instead, but it was even too cold for that. Promising ourselves we’d do it another time, we used the restroom (heated!) and finally set off down the trail.

The sun began to warm things up as we moved along. We were threading our way through and around the Skyland Resort area. Coming over a rise, I came upon two people who looked as if they were weeding the trail! I stopped to inquire about their strange activities. It turns out that it was a Park Ranger and a volunteer who were pulling out garlic mustard plants, an invasive species.  This plant is becoming quite a problem and efforts are being taken to eradicate it.  Moving on, the trail became rocky.  Our big climb today is Hawksbill Mountain, 3625’.  Once there we descend to Franklin Cliffs then begin a long slow ascent to Big Meadows. All day we had wonderful vistas to the west and the trail was relatively kind to our feet. While it didn’t look too bad on the map, the long haul up to the campground was actually the hardest part of the day.  It went on forever!  Ok, I know that 2 miles is not forever, but it sure seemed long.  It is always taxing to end the day on an uphill stretch. Wah, wah, wah. The good news is that we made it, stumbled back into camp and fell into our camp chairs. Once again the conversation turned to food and the rationalizing began.  Well, we do have to go to Skyland and pick up the car. The restaurant is right there. We wouldn’t have to cook. We could come back and take showers and do laundry instead. On my plate tonight: pulled pork tacos and blackberry cobbler (yes, again!)

Well- fed and showered, I quickly set up my hammock and tarp and fell in.  Another night in the low 30’s is predicted and I know I will sleep warmer in my cocoon…………","931.2 Skyland Resort South Road

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565907,"It was cold last night, but I was not!  Even though the temperature dropped again, I was toasty in my hammock. I really don’t know how anyone can sleep in a tent when a hammock is so comfortable. It looks to be a beautiful day and the birds are singing. There are numerous bluebirds at Big Meadows, more than I have seen anywhere. I just love watching them coming closer and closer looking for crumbs around the picnic table. They have to fight off the chipmunks, which are many in number as well!

Our hike today was to be short, so WT and I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast.  Around 10 am, we started packing up and getting ready to head out.

Today’s hike is from the stable area at Skyland Resort to the Pinnacle Picnic area.  We skirted the resort area over rolling hills.  As we approached the trail to Stony Man Summit, I came across this poor tree that had grown up wedged between two rocks.  The picture doesn’t show it very well, but it was obvious that the tree was determined to survive! We decided we did not want to climb to the summit, the highest point on the AT in the Shenandoah (3837’), so we moved along.

Coming around a bend in the trail we found a few groups of three people each, rummaging around in the brush and overturning rocks on both the uphill and downhill sides of the trail. It looked like they lost something!  Curiosity got the better of me and I stopped and asked what the heck they were doing. The Leave No Trace principles of hiking clearly state to stay on existing trails and not damage the foliage and plants by stomping around off trail.  As I inquired, I noticed one of the young women was wearing a National Park shirt.  Aha!  So it was an official stomping of plant life!  Not really, they were being very careful where they were walking and any rock they turned over, they replaced. What was the object of their search?  The Shenandoah Salamander, an endangered species found only in Shenandoah National Park!  They were taking a census, searching for and counting these tiny little creatures, which are black with a yellow stripe. These salamanders are found only at that particular elevation and only in a certain area within the Shenandoah.  While we were talking, one of the young ladies found one, so we were able to see first-hand just how small they are!  You can read more about this amphibian on the Shenandoah National Park website.  It was the highlight of the day!

The trail starts to descend from here and we passed by Stony Man Cliffs.  As you can imagine from the name, it was quite rocky.  The view opened up and there was a grand vista to the west, looking down at the town of Luray.  We stopped to take pictures and have a snack.  This was slow going for a while due to the rocks, but then the footing changed as we dropped in elevation.  In no time at all we arrived at the Pinnacle Picnic area and the car.  As we sat and rested, we discussed lunch/dinner, also known as “linner”, options. We did have to return to Skyland to pick up the other car.  The choice was really a no-brainer!  A hot meal you don’t have to cook yourself allows for more time relaxing back at the campsite.  This time though, the dining room was closed while they were setting up for dinner.  Fortunately the Mountain Room, a bar and grill, was open. I can’t even remember what I had, it was so unmemorable. I do know that, as per usual, I scarfed down more blackberry cobbler!

Back to camp, I made tea and relaxed in my camp chair, looking over notes for the rest of the week. Tomorrow’s hike will be a long one, so I headed to bed early to read.  Forecast overnight is for temps in the 40’s!  Yay, a heat wave!","Skyland Resort Road South

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565906,"The temperature last night wasn't too bad, so I was really toasty, snuggled in my hammock.  I didn’t need gloves, hand warmers and I only wore one hat!  I slept well and was ready to pop out of bed by 7 am.  Soon I had water boiling, oatmeal cooking and tea steeping. 
Breakfast is over and it is time to pack up the day pack with rain gear, lunch and water.  Wild Thang had decided to take the day off but agreed to drive me to my start point.  I encouraged her to meet me later at a couple of different locations, so she may surprise me.  Driving to south to Lewis Campground is new territory for us and we seem to be looking more south west at viewpoints than due west.  My hike today traverses a range on its eastern side, offering different views than before.  WT drops me off at the campground and I head out into the morning.  It is just a gorgeous day, sunny and cool.  The birds are singing and I see chickadees, wood thrush, bluebirds and a wood pecker. Right off the bat, I start climbing Bearfence Mountain, elevation 3511’ and it is rocky.  There is a side trail that leads to a very rocky peak, and I hear people talking up there, but see no one. Uh oh! Right smack in the middle of the trail is a large pile of bear poop!  Now, I have seen many piles during my hikes, but none as fresh as this one. The flies are still buzzing around it. Time to keep a sharp eye out and I quicken my pace.  As I leave the area, the trail becomes less rocky, and levels out as I descend to Bootens Gap parking area.  Will WT be here to join me?  I look for her car, but no.   Disappointed, I sit on a rock and have a snack while listening to the birds. They are in full song this morning and I love it.  I have noticed far more trillium blooming here as well, so there is lots of pink and white color among the greenery.  The leaves budding out on the trees on this side are ahead of those on the west side. It is so enjoyable being out of the wind for a change.  Snack time is over, I stand and stretch and take off.  Next up is a long uphill to Hazeltop, elevation 3812’.  The footing is good, but these long, slow uphills are more challenging than one would think. I hear a rustle as I am walking, so I stop and look around. Huh, there is a deer just 10’ off the trail to my right. She is looking at me, and I look at her. Neither of us moves. She decides I am not worth the effort, and returns to nibbling on the grass. I move along, and there on my left is another deer. I can’t believe how close I am to them. This one keeps feeding as well. I try not to take this rebuff personally!
Moving on, I look up the trail and here comes someone!  Is it WT? No, but it is someone I know. Remember Jersey Jane and Mad Hatter, the women from NJ?  Well, here comes JJ. We stop and chat, catching up on the past few days of bad weather, hiking and hostels.  I am glad to see them, as I was hoping I might be able to leapfrog cars with them while WT returns to Atlanta (niece’s graduation). Unfortunately for me, this is their last day of hiking. They must return to the real world tomorrow.

As we talk, I look up the trail and a deer pokes its head out into the trail from behind a bush. I tell JJ, she turns to look, deer pulls back. She turns back to me, we talk, I see deer again poking his head out, tell her, she looks, he pulls back in!  It’s like he is playing hide and go seek. I am in stitches laughing, because she doesn’t believe me that he is there. Suddenly Mad Hatter comes into view, heading towards us. Now the deer is caught between us as she advances and he bounds across the trail and runs away.  Too funny!  We say our goodbyes and off I go, still climbing.  They told me the trail is great footing all the way to Big Meadows.  This is good news indeed!  Soon I find myself coasting on a long downhill to Milam Gap parking area.  This is the second spot where WT could join me, and as I approach I search the parking lot for her car. Nope, it is not to be. Oh well, it is past lunchtime and I am running out of steam. Time to find a good rock to perch on, take the hiking boots off and let the feet air out while I eat.  The day has warmed up considerably, but clouds are rolling in and I feel a few sprinkles. It’s not even enough rain to bother with and it soon passes on.  I have about 2 miles left to go, mostly downhill. However, I did note one of those endless uphill into the campground. No matter, I made good time today hiking quickly and now I am motivated by the thought of my camp chair and a cup of tea! Off I go, pushing hard and soon the campground comes into sight. Now I have to completely circle the perimeter of Big Meadows to get to the spot where I exited the trail earlier in the week.  Fortunately it brings be out by the bathroom building.  There is a utility sink, and I duck my head under the cold running water.  Ahhh, that’s better!  Making my way to our campsite, I see that WT is not there. Unsure where I planned to exit the trail, she may be waiting for me at the upper level parking area trailhead. Soon she appears and we trade stories of our day.

It is now decision time for me. WT leaves early tomorrow. She returns in 5 days. Do I stay and wait? The hiking logistics become overly complicated with only one car.  Checking the weather, I see that storms are approaching, with a possible 1-2 inches of rain daily for the next 2-3 days.  This does not bode well for continuing.  

I sit in my camp chair, feet up on the picnic bench, sipping my cup of tea contemplating the situation. Bluebirds are flitting back and forth. Two deer cross through the campsite two sites away. A woodpecker hammers nearby.  Am I happy with what I have hiked? Hmmm. The answer is yes. I have completed 57 miles from Lewis Campground to Front Royal, VA and I loved almost every minute of it!  I will return late August and finish the rest.  I am heading home………………..","mi. 915.0 Lewis Campground
