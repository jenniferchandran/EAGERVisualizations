"""Chunky Monkey"" aka Chuck",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552411,I have begun my journal. I have added some stock photos of my gear. I have done about three pre-hikes and have three more planned. I am at a crossroads right now trying to determine which trail running shoes to use once it gets warm. I have a pair of Merrel Boots that I will begin with due to the cold (snow and rain). I have tried Brooks Cascadia 11 (to small in the toe box). Solomon's have a too stiff instep. La Sportiva has a high arch support (I have flat feet). Hooka just feels funny.   I have been told the Brooks Cascadia 12 will be bigger in the toe box.,"

"""Chunky Monkey"" aka Chuck",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552867,I have been doing some pre hikes varying in distances from 6 - 10 miles. I pushed one day to see if I can do the big miles but only did 12 miles. I have gotten my base weight down but nothing like some of the You Tube videos. I spent some days in the rain and some nights in 30 degree weather. I am planning one more pre hike of 5 days and 40 miles. I hope to be ready after that hike.,"Uwharrie Forest

"""Chunky Monkey"" aka Chuck",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553473,"The weatherman predicted snow and cold temps. Well I got the bright idea to camp ""in my backyard"" and test my tent and sleep system in cold temps. Well the plan was to set up the tent before the bad weather but not to put my bag and pad in until later so it would not be cold when I climbed in later that night. Well fast forward to 9 p.m. (hikers midnight) I proceed to climb into my tent. Now arises the problem. It is dark, sleeting and temp is around 36 f. I have my bag (not in a stuff sack) and sleeping pad (blown up) and of course the fly is zipped close and the tent door. I realize I need to keep my bag and pad dry while opening the fly. Well I lost my balance fell over onto the tent broke one rod which proceed to go in two directions up through the fly and down through the mesh of the tent body. Well when I reflected back on my plan I determined it was not at all real world situation First mistake, I would not have set up my tent and NOT put my gear in it with bad weather coming. Second mistake, it was dark where was my headlight; in the house. Third mistake, it was sleeting I would have already been in my tent by this time. So lesson learned but it was expensive. I had to replace my Big Agnes Fly Creek tent. I replaced it with a Lightheart Gear SOLO. It is a trekking pole tent made in NC so I feel I am supporting the local economy. It weighs around 2 lbs and was $295.00 which included seam sealing by the factory (good idea). I have already set it up a half dozen times and spent the night in it once to see how roomy it is and it has enough room for me and my gear. It worked well, the night I spent in it we got a pretty good shower of rain and there were no leaks; temps were about 40 and I slept in shorts and t-shirt in my 20 deg bag and was never cold. Thermometer showed 45 f in the tent.I went to the NOC during the Appalachian Trail Long Distance Hikers Association Meeting last weekend. Judy Gross (owner of lighthearted gear) was there and I purchased my tent from her.",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Thu",0

"""Chunky Monkey"" aka Chuck",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553609,"I attended a countable discussion at REI for information about AT Thru Hiking. The class was presented by three AT Thru hikers (Hipbone in 01, Cosmo and Midnight Strider in 16). The class was geared for people planning a 2018 AT Thru Hike not someone leaving in three weeks. I learned some information such as I probably could drop my Z-lite pad since I am carrying a Neo X-Lite no real need for two if I don't sleep cold. I may make my z-lite into a z-pad (two folds). I will carry my rain pants since I am starting so early, it may be a good insulating layer on those rainy 30 degree days.My wife said as she took the photo she thought it looks like I am going off to camp. I guess she is right it is just 2200 miles to the cabin.",,REI Class / Shakedown,"Jan 21, Sat",0
"""Chunky Monkey"" aka Chuck",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554212,"I set up my tent in the front yard and tried out my new REI Igneo sleeping bag. It was 26 F with a lot of moisture in the air last night. I slept warm and good. I did use my cocoon liner and had on my medium weight thermals, whatever the reason.... I slept good. I woke about 6 and got ready to start packing up for a quick 6 miles until I heard the rain/sleet falling. Dang. I just laid there for about thirty minutes and then decided well you want some real world situation, here you go. So I slid out of my bag, got dressed and packed all I could in my tent. Just as I started unzipping the tent I realized I didn't hear the rain. Woo hoo better lucky than good. So I got the tent down and packed up. Skipped coffee and pop tart went right to hiking. Oh well not exactly I did go into the bathroom. Even though I am in the middle of my farm and 1/4 mile off the road ""peeing"" in the front yard just doesn't seem right. I walked three miles to the first stop light near my house and came back. I enjoyed it no real problems. I did get a little nervous I have to cross a bridge and a car was coming and didn't seem to be moving over. I thought dang two weeks and I am going to have to jump in the creek and probably break a leg but good news didn't happen. I covered the 6 miles in about two hours. I have my base weight down to about 17lbs. I threw in my food bag with 7lbs of odds and ends for food and had two Liters of water. Getting excited and nervous, like your first real date and you have to knock on the door and pray she answers not her Dad.","

Well the first 2 full days are complete he has reported that he is tired but doing very good. I am just letting everyone know that over the next week he will be changing his trail name to ""Chunky Monkey"" This name change is due to his oversized food bag. LOL Most people have Taco Tuesday, he has ""Five Guys Friday"" Today he sent me a pic replacing his hamburger from ""Five Guys"" with a Tortilla Wrap, Spam & Cheezits - maybe in 2200 miles he will go from ""Chunky Monkey"" to ""Slim Jim""....
He will be posting more as he is able to get internet service. Happy Trails to all ....","Three Forks

Crossed into NC today and was greeted by a climb up Bly Gap - that is like seeing the blue lights on a NC Highway Patrol Car - it ain't funny!
As a side note I want to send a Happy Birthday wish to my nephew Clay who turned 13 today - it was my walk in the woods with him preparing for his boy scout hikes that made me realize my desire to do this.","Top of Georgia

At $125 a day I decided to head into the Smokies. Knee felt 50% at best. Got a ride to Fontana Shelter, walked across the dam and to the trailhead and deposited my permit. Started up the trail passed the rock jumble - felt something uncomfortable in my knee and it stopped working as God designed. So then like one of my favorite restaurants ""I-Hopped"" down the trail back across the dam and was lucky to find someone who took pity on me and took me back to the lodge. On my way back I called my ""Better 3/4"" who made arrangements with Enterprise Rental Car and long story short I slept in my bed on Monday night - thank goodness for cruise control since it is my right knee driving was a little tricky.Tuesday (today) I have evaluated and tested my knee - swelling has decreased - Wednesday I will contact my doctor - I hope to be back on the trail AGAIN in a couple of weeks in the words of Joe Cocker ""With a Little Help from my Friends""All I know is I hope the third time is a charm and not my third strike.....","Fontana Lodge
