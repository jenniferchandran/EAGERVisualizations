JennJo Lusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543653,"I've read that when you say it aloud, when you tell your friends and family ""I'm hiking the AT!!"" You make it official. I told friends and family and after I explained what AT stood for, oh my,was I the crazy one!! I heard all the reasons why I couldnt, why I shouldn't. I doubted myself and nearly resigned the whole idea though keeping a glimmer of my dream in my heart. I mean who just decides to drop out of daily society and walk 2200 miles leaving behind their family, pets, jobs, responsibilities, life with conveniences like indoor plumbing and tv??
Recently though a major life change came about, its ME!! I set my date over a year ago and I'm keeping it! 
I'm excited!! I'm looking forward to more pages and the day drawing closer.
See you all soon!!",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Tue",0

I have some extra gear I'm trying to sell and deciding on a new tent, a 2person under 4lbs as opposed to the 3person 8 pounder! Whoa thats got to go! I've talked to a few more friends and they are excited for me!! & hopefully will meet up with me along the way!! Planning and prepping continue..woohoooo I'm going to do this!!",,View Entry,"Jul 27, Wed",0
JennJo Lusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549628,"Sooooo,I made a major move thanks to some great friends in my life. I located myself in North Georgia! Week 1 was Blood Mountain and dear bob did I get a slap in the pack! Too much weight, no clue what I was in for. Thankfully my bestie and my bob kept me focused, kept it real! Blood Mt, Albert Fire Tower, Rabun Bald, Black Rock Mt, just a few, all amazing and just a teeny tiny hint of whats ahead. I'm getting more comfortable with my gear, what works and what I must change.
As this is my 3rd entry my journal becomes visible. Woohooo Im really excited for this journey as I continue 1 foot in front of the other!",,# 3 and here I go!!,"Sep 27, Tue",0
JennJo Lusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549752,"Spent the past weekend in NYC and urban hiked the city! While a concrete & glass jungle that it is, it was a great adventure with a great friend! Maybe 20 miles haha or realistically 10-12. Hey a hike is a hike right!?!
Looking at the calendar thinking 5 more months, that seems like a long ways off. Reading through the many journals brings the time closer, for some reason. Maybe its the excitement of all the awesomeness I'm going to meet along the way!! 
I've uploaded a few pics, the prequel to my journey, its making me eager to get started. Winter is coming, for me a sign that this is really going to happen!! 
I'll be working towards trading out the tent for 8, haha 8lb-er (yea, I thought I'd have it to share w/a partner) and continually adding weight to my pack, building my strength and preparing my mind, if thats a reasonable task while still living in the luxuries of indoor plumbing and readily available food. I haven't done a solo overnight yet, don't know if I will before the trail.
Happy trails and good vibes sent to everyone preaparing for this amazing life changing/challenging adventure!!~j",,View Entry,"Sep 28, Wed",0
