Unfortunately, I just couldn't do it anymore.   My refusal to participate in policies that blatantly cause suffering of the most defenseless resulted in my current status as unemployed. After 9 years and a serious case of PTSD from an event at work that occurred late last year, I am starting my soul journey just a little early.   I am sitting in the Walmart parking lot while my house is being shown by the real estate agent.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551465,"This morning I started my first journey of 2000 miles. I drove 718 miles. Tonight I am in my new ""home"" for the next three and a half months. I am on my way to see places I have never seen. Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, maybe even the Pacific Ocean. I can't wait to see the desert and the Rocky Mountains. I'll be hiking and backpacking to keep my brain busy. 
Highlights of today's journey. 
1. Passing through Chunky, Mississippi (that is just mean)
2. Tallulah, Louisiana has a big flashing light on the interest with a yellow sign with a Bear on it. ""Bear Crossing"" ( made me laugh out loud imagining them all up and down the AT)
3. Rayville, Louisiana I passed a large sedan with a huge pack of chicken breasts/thighs/drumsticks prominently displayed in the back window. Defrosting at its finest!
Tonight I am staying at Tyler State Park... wondering if they have bears!",,"Tyler, TX","Nov 15, Tue",718
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551628,"On day 2, I drove all the way through Texas. It seems as if I drove pretty much all of Interstate 20 in Texas. I sort of felt a little guilty missing the parts between the exit ramps for stops. It just really wasn't feasible (nor legal) to go back to the “trail” the way I came. Around Colorado City, TX, I saw a sign that read “Do NOT pick up hitchhikers in the area”. I was slightly perplexed. Why this stretch? Then near Eagle Flat, TX, I saw another sign “PRISON AREA, Do Not Pick up Hitchhikers in this AREA” Then in all made sense!!! I am glad there are no prisons along the AT.By far, the most annoying aspect of the drive was the disagreements between my bladder and my gas tank. Why couldn't they just agree on the distance between stops.I passed by a sign that read “Brushy Creek Cowboy Church”, it really made me want a cowboy hat and a pair of boots, but I managed to refrain.Passing through El Paso, I saw Mexico. I have never been. Not this trip, but maybe after the AT. I did however have to pass through a border patrol check point. It scared me a little that I had gotten off course somehow.After conquering Texas, I stayed at Rockhound State Park near Deming, NM. It was beautiful. Everything out here is just so different.   Beautiful, but different.",,Rockhound State Park,"Nov 16, Wed",835
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551629,"The days drive was much shorter. Only about 8 hours. New Mexico and Arizona have so far been more beautiful that I could have imagine. I can't believe how far you can see. I saw my first big cactus . I just can't believe how big they are. I hear they can be even bigger. On the entire drive, I never once had to stop on the interstate for traffic or construction until about 15 miles before Quartzsite. In Atlanta, not one trip goes by you aren't in standstill traffic.   I was fortunate to be stopped in an area where I was able to get my first picture of a big fellow. However looking at the picture now, I think its flipping me off. Probably a bad sign.At the BLM site, I found a nice place to park looking out over the desert. I can see the mountains in the distance.    But last night, the longer I sat here, the more I began to question my decision to come out here. I don't know why I am here, I just know that I couldn't stay in Georgia any longer. Everything there was so incredibly painful. Everyday something I saw or heard would trigger flashbacks. I just needed to get away. Now I debating on of course just going back. I can't decide if the fear of the unknown is greater than the pain of the know.",,Quartzsite AZ,"Nov 17, Thu",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551630,"I just watched the sunrise and it was amazing. I tried to refrain from taking too many pictures and just watch. I have a bad habit of watching things though my camera trying to get an awesome photo. But in all reality, my photos mean nothing to anyone but me so why not just watch with my eyes alone. Not sure what my plan is for today. Maybe I will just sit. I spent the darkness before sunrise debating on if I should drive to Tempe and buy a tent. Last year, I walked the first 250 miles or so of AT in sections using a hammock. I have my hammock with me now but it's really not going to do me any good in the desert. I feel like I should be a well prepared hiker/backpacker and go buy a tent for my treks out here. Maybe I could figure out how to set up my hammock/tarp on the ground but I don't know if it's smart to rely on that. I am actually sort of fearful of using a hammock on my thru. I don't know why. But I have actually never slept in a tent. My first backpacking experience ever was from Springer to Neel Gap in August 2015 and that was with my hammock and a sleeping pad. Lesson learned so I bought an underquilt. The rest of the trips were much more successful. I was going to go to Koda Wildlife Refuge today. But I think I am just going to explore La Posa and debate on whether buying a real tent and sleeping pad is a waste of money.",,What now,"Nov 18, Fri",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551884,"Arizona was absolutely breathtaking. The desert was world of its own. The sunsets and sunrises revealed colors I have never seen before. The night skies glistened with a million tiny stars.   The unobstructed moon lit up the desert rocks while the coyotes howled.   The wind danced across the desert tossing ribbons of sand as far as the eye could see. Yet with all the beauty, I felt so dry. Not just literally, but figuratively as well.
I sat in the stillness and tried to decide what to do next.   I visited Kofa Wildlife Refuge and took a walk up Crystal Hill. It was a short easy walk. Rocks, boulders and cactus.. Then more of the same. Everything is brown and gray. The colors only appeared in the sky. From the top of the hill, I could see my SUV and wondered where it would take me next. Up, up and away.
On the way back to Quartzsite, the sky became dark and I was excited about the possibility of rain. I never realized how much I love rain. In Atlanta, it hadn't rained in weeks but I could still look around and see a pond with water. Or a stream making its best effort to give the flora and fauna its last trickle of love.
Back at the LTVA, I parked and started planning. I needed water. I pulled out my handy road atlas and started looking for the biggest closet body of water. I found the Salton Sea State Recreation Area near Mecca, CA.   As I planned out my next morning's journey, I noticed the sound of a little sprinkle on my truck. To the east were dark clouds and to the west a blazing sun hovered low on the horizon. Up, up and away I thought.   Then in the sky above my home for the next three months was the most magnificent rainbow. I could see both ends as the arc towered above me. The colors were blinding.   As I watched a single spray of color spread into two.   The double rainbow hovered above for at least 30 minutes as I sat with the setting sun warming my back.   One more day closer to March.",,Arizona,"Nov 20, Sun",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552267,"Upon seeing the huge body of water, my hopes were raised.   Water in some form is definitely needed to ease my soul.   The Salton Sea is a beautiful sight to see from a distance. The birds flying overhead and bobbing on the gentle waves gave a me sense of peace. Then, I walked down to the beach. The shore of the huge lake was odd feeling under my feet and the smell was horrible. I examined the crunchiness beneath my feet. It wasn't sand. I picked up a handful and much to my dismay it was made mostly of tiny bones. The entire beach was littered with hundreds of dead fish. Most were pretty much mummified. Completely empty, just a shell.   And it was then I realized it definitely wasn't the place for me.   I have seen enough death and felt enough emptiness to last a lifetime. The next day I explored a little, took a few pictures then made my plans to head back east. I definitely need trees, water and color.   While I made my plans, I realized I really like squirrels..... even if they do like to pummel me with acorns.",,California,"Nov 21, Mon",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552272,"Heading back east incited a wave of panic and an overwhelming sense of the familiar failure. I am obviously not meant to be out west. The desperate need for water, trees and color outweighed those feelings.   The first night on the journey back, I stayed at Homolovi State Park in Winslow, Arizona. It was a beautiful place. I explored the remaining pieces of an ancestral Hopi village. It was beautiful. The second night, I stayed at Palo Duro Canyon State Park. I think this was Thanksgiving day. At least I think so. I have never been a fan of holidays, so for me it just seemed like another day. At the entrance of the park was a majestic longhorn. The night was relatively uneventful and the next morning I started the drive to Lake Fort Smith State Park in Arkansas. While driving that day I was delighted to see trees again. So happy to see colors!   I had imagined Oklahoma to be as flat and bare as Texas. I couldn't have been more wrong.   The gentle rolling hills, the pastures, and the overwhelming sense of familiarity were a welcoming feeling. I was shocked at home much the area reminded me of the place where I grew up in northeast Georgia.   The pastures had ponds, the bridges had water underneath them.   I almost felt as if I was “home”.Upon arriving at Lake Fort Smith, I was so happy to smell wood. The smell the mountains again.   The campground was quite crowded. Briefly, the people on either side of me quieted down. I enjoyed listening to the leaves flutter across the ground. I smiled as I watched squirrels collecting acorns.   The ladybugs also started visiting. Bright red and shades of orange adorned them much like they adorned the leaves surrounding me.As the sun finally started to set, the campsite next to me decided their means of communing with nature was to be shared with the surrounding campers. They turned on the TV in their pop up camper as loud as could be to watch what sounded like M*A*S*H reruns.I decided just to go to bed and get up early to drive back instead of staying another night there.",,Georgia,"Nov 26, Sat",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553178,"Just a little over six weeks till the adventure begins. I am currently questioning every piece of gear I have. I love my hammock and sleep really well in it. But I am concerned about warmth.   I only have a top quilt and an underquilt rated to 20 degrees. I don't want to waste money on 0 degree gear. I am waiting on a travel sock from Warbonnet and I have a Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor. These two will add 18 ounces or so to my base weight. But they are both still several hundred dollars less than new quilts.   I am bringing a cut down thermorest zlite pad as well.   That's another 11 ounces.   Other debates...Pepper spray.... I “feel” as if I should take some.   But the likelihood I would actually use it is so slim. People say I will possibly need it for people and dogs.   The reality is I have been attacked by four dogs at once before.   I don't think if I would have had pepper spray would have helped at all. I don't think I would use it on people either.   What will be, will be.Microspikes... I will be leaving on February 24. I know there is a very high possibility of ice and snow.   I know if I take them, I won't need them and if I don't have them, I will need them. I am not going to have the option of sending stuff “home” and then getting it sent back. I guess if I really need them I could always Amazon them to myself . If I do decide to get them ahead of time, that's another 11 ounces.Gloves... I have a pair of REI minimalist mitts. The debate is what to put under them. I have a pair of thick Outdoor research windstopper gloves.   But I also have a pair of really really cheap Walmart fleece gloves. The fleece gloves actually feel so much warmer than the thicker ones.   The cheap ones are also so much easier to maneuver in as well.    Anyway, anyway. Once I get the travel sock, my pack weight will be about 34 pounds. That includes 1 liter of water and 4 days of food. That also includes 3.2 pounds of camera stuff.   Oh and my poles aren't included in that. My first backpacking trip ever was the Appalachian Trail from Springer to Neel Gap.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553950,"Its getting closer and closer. Only about 25 days till I leave. I am excited and scared at the same time.   I know this is an opportunity to try to heal myself. I keep telling myself whether I succeed or fail, I can at least say I have tried.   I pretty much have everything I am taking here with me. I have a pair of fuzzy sleeping socks and a different screw top bowl that should arrive tomorrow. I am currently debating on whether or not to do a gear video and put it on you tube.   I know making the video will keep me busy for some of the 25 days remaining but more fears of mine set in. The first is I absolutely hate the way I sound/look and I don't want to open myself up to the negative comments. Secondly, I know people will tell me to buy this and buy that and I am really trying to conserve funds now. I am hoping that if I do decide to make a video that I can be strong and stick to what I have.   I was hoping to be able to do more practice hikes but even that's hard. The most reasonable place to go (20 minutes away) for a five mile loop (Stone Mountain) is really really hard on my anxiety because I may run into people/things from my “past” life. The last time I went, I had a panic attack. Thank goodness I was only a quarter mile from the car.I do apologize to all reading that I am such an Eeyore. I am really hoping that I can change my mindset with a little walking and reflection. Thank you to everyone for all the encouragement.",,Almost Time,"Jan 30, Mon",0
Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554592,"10 days.   Wow. I can't believe the time is almost here.   The fear of the unknown and the excitement of beginning this journey are both overwhelming. I have all of my gear together. I tried several times to make a gear video for YouTube but I just can't bring myself to put myself on the internet for all the world to possibly see. I do plan on putting some videos up of the actual trail but I can pretty much guarantee there will be no selfies.The last year and a half have been spent dreaming of taking this amazing walk. I made so many sacrifices. I lost so many things that meant the world to me. I spend every waking moment either thinking about the trail or crying over whether I made the right decisions. But I do know for certainty that now is the time for me to truly focus on myself and becoming the person I desperately want to be. Its time for the past to be be left behind, for me to experience the present, and look forward to my future whatever that may be.In the process of trying to do the failed gear video, I did take some pictures of my gear, and hammock set up.   And to everyone who has signed my guest book, I am trying to write everyone back but if I haven't gotten to you yet I promise I will before I leave.

I broke down my ""house"" for the last few months and stashed it in the back of the SUV. It felt a little odd to leave behind my tiny house for a nice long walk in the woods.   Uber delivered me to the North Springs Marta Station. Not long after I arrived safely at the Hiker Hostel.

After breakfast, we all loaded up and were driven to the Vistor Center at the falls. I took a moment to reflect on the reasons I want to complete this hike and what I have sacrificed to get to this point. As I walked through the arches, I knew my life would never be the same. Once I came to the steps up the waterfall, my mind finally went blank as I focused on the task in front of me instead of my past. Once past the falls, I struggled to reach my planned destination of Springer Mountain Shelter.   As time passed, I knew my first failure was going to occur.   People were passing me carrying twice as much.   I finally arrived at Black Gap Shelter and decided to spend the night.

I took a few pictures and some video. It was clear and the view was amazing. It was very fitting that I started out this journey alone with only my thoughts. The excitement was overwhelming. I was so glad that I didn't make it up there the first day. Emotions took over and I cried just a little of course. The time to walk away from my past finally arrived and the journey to my future begins. The day was sunny and the mountains were amazing of course. I made it to Hawk Mountain Campground.

I ate my oatmeal and had my coffee. I was on the trail fairly early and prepared for the days rain.   It was warm than expected so I ended up hiking in my zip off shorts, my tshirt and my rain jacket. I tried all day not to be discouraged by the people passing me. I am slow and I am working on accepting that. I have to careful on the downs not to place my foot wrong or slip. My knee is tender and regardless of what happens, I will finish this. I have to. So I am slow on the ups and even slower on the downs.   The trail was beautifu. The overcast skies and the occasional light drizzle made the forest glisten. It was breathtaking.   After many hours and many breaks, I arrived at a packed Gooch Mountain Shelter. I set up my house and ate dinner. I went to bed pretty early. The laughing at the shelter was entertaining but I am not quite ready to join.

My knee was really starting to act up making it more and more difficult to make progress. The knee brace I have isn't quite cutting it. I decided I would look for a different one at Mountain Crossings if I make it. I stopped and had lunch at Woody Gap. I was really looking forward to bedding down for the night. Once I made it Lance Creek in the early afternoon, I got my tarp and hammock up. I made the trip downhill for water and it started to rain pretty heavily. I was nervous about cooking dinner under my tarp but it was either that or no dinner. I made the least smelly thing I had. I cleared a spot out in the leaves and boiled some water. Once I was done with the canister, I picked it up and found the cutest slimiest salamander underneath. I know he wasn't there when I put it down. We had dinner together while I watch him move from leaf to leaf.   He was looking for a comfy place and I wanted to make sure it wasn't my shoe.

The trek up wasn't as bad as I remembered.   I was walking in the clouds and fog all day. It was eerie and beautiful. The rocks were slippery but I made it to the top. The shelter was shrouded in misty fog. It seemed fitting considering the history of the area.   The downhill was quite treacherous. I think it took twice as long to come down as it did to go up. Once safely down to the intersection of the Freeman Trail Junction, I sat down for a little break to rest my knee. Someone had built a cairn with the mountains and a beautiful blooming pink tree. I took pictures and then headed down to Mountain Crossings. The hostel was pretty full and I didn't want to splurge on a cabin so I picked up my package and a few snacks and headed up to Bull Gap. I got my hammock up, dinner eaten and bear bag hung right before the storm blew in. I was in the worst possible spot for such a storm. The wind was blowing over the ridge and kept me violently swinging all evening long. I think the winds had to have been at least 50 to 60 miles an hour at times and probably 30 miles per hour sustained. I had to restate my Tarp several times but I managed to stay dry and warm. The wind sock I have for my hammock kept out most of the wind. I didn't sleep well at all. At about 1am, after a really bad wind episode I thought my brain jacket took a ride. I got out of my hammock and tried searching for it. But as I was standing out there, I saw the most amazing sky. Stars everywhere since the wind blew all the clouds away. I didn't see my rain jacket until I was back under the tarp. It had whipped around to the other side of my pack but it was there. I secured it in my pack and climbed back in.

The first eight miles weren't bad but by mile 9 the night before had caught up with me. I was tired and ready for bed. The last mile or so downhill into Low Gap my knee locked up. I forgot to look at the braces at Neel Gap so I ordered one from Amazon to be delivered to Budget Inn in Hiawasee. By the time, I got to Low Gap I felt like I was just done.

I decided to only go to Blue Mountain Shelter a measly 7.3 miles away to give my knee a break. I took it extra slow. I had done this part of the trail in October 2015 and remembered it well. It is truly one of my favorite sections in Georgia. It has dramatic drop offs, beautiful views, ""flat"" sections, rock fields, just absolutely gorgeous. When I was out before it was Halloween, A SOBO came around one of the corners wearing a werewolf mask. His beard and hair pretty much make the costume! I had a giggle and just thouroughly enjoyed that walk. This walk was perfect. My knee was much better and barely bothered me at all.

I decided I would rather have that weight in my belly than on my back for that last climb. As I was going up, over a dozen people passed me. They were all talking about the trail magic at Unicoi. I had just came though too soon. Maybe next time. Since so many people had passed I knew the shelter was going to be bustling. I was right!

But for some reason as the day progressed I just felt worse. It took way longer than usual to go the 4.5 miles to the shelter. I was hoping to get there before the rain but unfortunately I walked the last hour in a light rain. I didn't end up too wet but enough to get slightly chilled. I ate a little and then arranged my house. I cooked dinner about 5:00pm and then crawled into my hammock. I am warm and content. The rain is falling on my tarp and it sounds like heaven.

Even though I didn't feel that great, it was still a good day. The sun was bright and the sky was an amazing blue. I reached the Georgia/North Carolina Border right after 11am. I was so happy to see that I was the only one there. Another milestone in my journey where solitude allowed me to reflect on the past, present and future. It was a bit overwhelming to know that I was leaving my home state. After this adventure, I don't think I will ever be able to go back. I am not sure where I will end up but I am hoping for a tiny amount of clarity on where my life goes from here. As soon as I headed up the hill to Bly Gap and the tree, the wind kicked up. As I pushed harder up the hill, the worse I felt. My head felt like it was stuffed with popcorn and then my ears started to hurt. I stopped half way up and hid behind a fallen tree for some lunch and to put on my rain coat and hood as a wind break. It helped some and I finally reached the top. I talked to a few people today who had all left on March 1st.   I am sure I will passed by the bubble soon. I know that my body just can't do the things I want it too. The last couple of years, I did so much damage to it that it will never be able to keep up. I am going to attempt to do 12.5 miles tomorrow. I don't know if I can but I have to try. At some point, I want to go quicker so I don't have to carry as much food. At Muskrat tonight, I found a place to set up my hammock by the stream. The sound sort of drowns out the noise at the shelter. I know they are all having a good time and that's what matters. I am sure we will all be asleep before long. The foot end of my hammock and quilt got a little damp last night in the rain. I am glad I got to Muskrat early so I could let it try out a bit before adding the windsock. Hopefully my head and ears will be better tomorrow so I can make it to Carter Gap. **Photos on Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556451,"I woke up early and was all packed up and hit the trail about 7:08am. I wanted to get to Carter Gap Shelter 12.5 miles away. This would be my first over 12 mile day and I wanted to give myself plenty of time. The terrain wasn't bad at all but still about 8 miles in my knee was yelling. I took more ibuprofen and continued on. I walked through much of the area I went through last year around March 15. The area was so completely different. The forest fire that swept through changed everything. I known that the forest will heal and new growth will flourish. It was an excellent reminder that time does heal. Today was my 40th birthday. As I walked through the charred landscaped, I kept reminding myself that healing is possible. My scars will never fade completely and I will never be the same as I was before, but life will continue. I will regrow my hope. My determination to survive this past will blossom with each step I take. I wake up every morning and choose to continue moving forward. The forest, the trail has given me a path to the phase of my life and I am not going to give up just yet. ** Photos on Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556460,"Last night at Carter Gap Shelter were thunderstorms and quite a bit of lightning. Several strikes seems to feel as if they were right over us. Everything seemed to just shake. The wind started up again and of course I did quite a bit of swaying.   I am so scared that the wind will get underneath my tarp and take it away. The soil in the burned areas just isn't very solid. There are several inches of soot on top of the soil. I try and try but it just seems like I am not finding good spots. I am starting to think about getting a tent to try for a little while. I really don't want to waste the money but I also don't want to be terrified every night.   The views today were amazing. The storms last night made the most beautiful skies over the mountains this morning.   I of course have a thing for clouds. The section was just like I remembered it from last year. My favorite little piece is right before Albert Mountain walking in the side of the mountain overlooking Big Butt, NC. That's actually what it says on the map. Albert Mountain up was quite a climb. In some places, I basically had to crawl. My legs just aren't long enough. I crossed the 100 mile mark. I was excited to see someone had made a Little Rock formation. Otherwise, I am still pretty stuffy. I am not sure if it's allergies or a cold. Either way once I get into Franklin, I'll be buying some medicine when I get my resupplies.   I am also thinking about taking a zero to help heal my head and my knee and wait out a little weather episode.   I am going to try to get down into Winding Stair Gap for the 9:30 shuttle. I hope that I can get there quickly without causing too much knee pain. ** Photosbon Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Carter Gap Shelter

I was able to get there in time for the 9:30 shuttle. I went a bit too quickly and I was hurting by the time I got down. I figured it was worth it though. 
Once I got in to Budget Inn, I asked for an additional night. I will be taking my first zero tomorrow.   I waited a little bit for the room to be be ready. Once I had everything in the room, I walked the 0.5 mile down the road to the Ingles. I got all my resupplies and headed back. I got everything all sorted and packaged out. I did laundry and spent the rest of the day worrying about taking a zero and what I was going to do. By the end of the day, I had decided that yes I would buy a tent.   The outfitters was closed but the little one across the street is going to be open tomorrow. 
Fingers crossed, I am making the right decision.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556466,I went to the outfitters early and bought a copper spur UL 1. I spent the day playing with and taking it up and down inside the hotel room. It snowed over night but melted fairly quickly. All day I felt completely defeated and was second guessing buying the tent. I try to keep telling myself that this is an adventure and I have to learn to adapt. I have a horrible habit of seeing things in two extremes. Right or Wrong. Success or Failure. Victory or Defeat. Light or Dark. Part of my purpose of this walk is to learn to be more at peace with the unknown. To teach myself not to think in black and white. I long to see the shades of gray. I packed up my hammock and mailed it to myself at the NOC. I am hoping the tent works out better.   Being in the towns has a tendency to send me into a depression so I kept myself busy most of the day. I am heading out in the morning to Winding Stair Gap. I plan to only go to Siler Bald Shelter so that I have time to play around more with my tent.

There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground up here. It's just amazing the difference a little elevation can make. The climbing didn't seem that bad at all. However the further up I went the cloudier and cloudier and cloudier it got. More and more snow covered the ground. The trail in places was snow free and muddy but in other places it was more of a slushy ice layer. I arrived at the first Silar Bald Shelter trail fairly early so I decide to go to the second trail.   That side of the mountain seemed to have quite a bit more snow. I knew as soon as I got to the second trail that I just going to keep going to Wine Spring or maybe even Wayah Bald Shelter. In order to save time, I decided against going up to Siler Bald. (I went up last year). I knew it would be my first night ever in a tent and I didn't want to be at a shelter alone.   I have only slept in my hammock outside. Once I got to Wine Spring Campground, I decided to keep going since it was deserted as well. I made it to the tower at Wayah Bald and took a picture. I was there last year before the fire and I wanted comparison photos. About 30 minutes before I got to the shelter, it started sleeting/raining a little bit. I found a semi flat spot and set up my tent for the first time outside. I managed to get it all set up and was inside when it really started to come down.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556474,"I woke up several time overnight. I wasn't cold but I did keep sliding toward the front of the tent. Guess my ""flat"" spot wasn't so flat. It was odd arranging everything in the tent when I am so used to just hanging everything off my ridgeline in the hammock. In some ways it was much easier and in some ways it was much harder. When I woke up for the final time about 6 am, I was in a snow cave. I had cell service and took a look again at the whether. Fear set in and I called a lodge and got a room and a shuttle pick up at Burningtown Gap. I had a hard time packing up everything in the tent while keeping everything semi dry. I was so thankful that I was able to tie strings in my tent stakes the night before. I would have never been able to get them out of the ground if I hadn't. I finally managed to pack up all the stuff and get the tent all broken down. I was very very late leaving for me but I did manage to finally start walking down about 45 minutes after most people had already gone. The 4 miles to the pickup point was a wild walk! It was snowing the entire time and the footprints ahead of me disappeared quickly. I was playing ""Where's Waldo"" with the white blazes all morning. I made it to Burningtown Gap more quickly than I thought I would. I was cold and wet and the wind was crazy. I got to the lodge and spent the afternoon debating on tomorrow plans.   The forecast was cold and the windchill was going to be in the negatives. A few people here wanted to slack pack the section or start again. My fear was overwhelming and I decided to take another zero and not risk injury or freezing to death. I think about all that I sacrificed to get    here and I just don't want to risk ending it because of going out in weather like this. If I seriously hurt myself, my journey ends and I'll be back living in my SUV trying to decide on my future. I have been out here less than 20 days and I am not closer to finding my truth than when I left.   My heart hurts so bad at the thoughts of having to stop early that I will try to stay on the safe side as long as financially possible. I will continue to go slow and be careful. Tomorrow I'll spend the day uploading photos and journals. I wasn't in the right mindset to do any of them in Franklin on my 1st zero. So tomorrow, I'll take another zero and try to ease all my fears. ** Photos and video on Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Wayah Bald Shelter

I haven't been uploading to instagram but I may upload a few pictures this evening to keep my brain busy. I will probably spend the rest of the evening trying to figure out where I'll end up the next few nights. It's really hard because I am not sure how the trail will be with the leftover snow/ice and I am trying not to buy anymore food and just make do with what I had brought from Franklin. I have been outside for a little while today. Everything down here is melting but the tops of the mountains you can see from here are still ice covered. The wind had picked up and the blowing snow and ice from the trees is just beautiful. I will be heading out about 8:30 in the morning. Ideally I would like to make it to Rufus A Morgan tomorrow but Wesser maybe a more reasonable stopping point.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556745,"Today was by far my most difficult day. Emotionally as well as physically. I was dropped off at Burningtown Gap NC at around 8:30am. It was about 10 degrees and snow was everywhere! The walking was hard but I finally managed to get going at a pace that kept me pretty warm. Once I made it to Cold Spring Shelter, I saw my first other humans of the day. Several guys had stayed there and were heading into the NOC for the evening. My plans were to try for Wesser Bald Shelter (7 miles) and if I got there early enough to head to A Rufus Morgan. I knew the climb down into NOC was rough in great conditions and I knew it would be horrible with the snow and ice. As the day passed ever one of the guys from Cold Springs Shelter passed me by. The climb up to Wesser Bald was tough like I remembered it but actually worse because of the snow, slush, mud and ash. I made it to Wesser Bald Shelter around 2 and decided to head downhill to Rufus. It was warmer and I hoped that some of the ice had melted. I was scared to wait till morning to try. I knew all the ice would re freeze. Once I got to the scary part, I knew it was going to be shear hell. For what seemed like a couple of miles, I just sat down and slid on my rear. The ice was so slippery and my boots/poles couldn't find a place to grip. In several places, I truly believed I was going to slid right over the edge. Everyone had already passed me for the day and I knew if something happened there would no one to find me till the next day. I was literally in tears all the way down. I was shaking so badly not just from fear but also from being so cold. My pants are fairly thin and they did not fair well on the slide. I was so emotionally exhausted that I was just hoping it would just be over with. I am trying so hard to remain positive about my future but when my head gets involved it's terrifying. Once I made it down to Rufus, I saw that I was absolutely the only person there. Everyone else had continued down to NOC. I setup and got situated for night two in the tent.    I still haven't managed to find a flat spot and I keep sliding. I definitely miss my hammock and will be switching back after the Smokies.

It's supposed to be windy and rainy, so we will see how I fair. A trail angel is bringing me new pants! I looked in the NOC and they had absolutely no convertible pants for women. Jef is coming up this evening for a long section hike with friends and they will be walking in the dark! The shelter is down a big hill and I want to make it easier on them when they run by sometime during the night/early morning. So far, so good. I haven't been blown off the mountain yet! When I stopped by NOC this morning, I got some insoles and yet another knee brace. If I have to wear 12 braces, I will just keep walking. My knee only gave me a little trouble on the 6 or so miles up. So today, I am grateful it was all up!The snow was pretty much gone down at the bottom but as I climbed higher and higher the scenery became whiter and whiter. It is absolutely fascinating to see the different areas. One side of the mountain will be white and then you walk around to the other side and it's all melted. The parts of the trail that never see sun like the rhododendron tunnels still have several inches. Mentally today was a much much better day. I am so incredibly thankful for a group I am a member of on Facebook. The Appalachian Trail Women's group have given me so much support that I really don't know if I would still be out here if it wasn't for them. Absolutely no one I know from my former life has shown any interest in my progression up the trail. Out of sight, out of mind.

I am still struggling to find a spot for my tent where I don't slide all the way to the front or to the back. Maybe one day, I'll figure it out. The wind and rain continued all night long. I didn't sleep much which was probably a good thing. I had woken up about 3am and couldn't go back to sleep. About 3:30, the area lit up which headlamps. It was Jef and his friends! They brought me my much needed new pants and ibuprofen. It was absolutely amazing to experience such kindness from a complete stranger. I will never be able to repay the generosity but I will most definitely pay it forward one day soon. The days was another tough one! I packed up in the rain and started moving as quickly as I could. At Cheoah Bald, the night's clouds still hovered over. I couldn't see the wonderful views like last year, but I believe this sight was just as amazing. A huge part of my being feels as if being up in the clouds is my home. It helps me to focus on the present. The shroud keeps me from looking too far in the future and from glancing back and focusing on the past. As I left, all I could think about was getting my brand new pants all dirty on day one! The clouds eventually blew away and I was welcomed with blue skies. I passed though Stecoah Gap then went up Jacobs Ladder. It wasn't nearly as bad as last year. The temperature was much cooler and the partly cloudy skies gave me moments of shade. I was very nervous as I continued to walk in regards to finding a tent site. Several people passed heading there as well. When I finally arrived, I was able to set my tent up in a hole that acted as a windbreak. I traipsed down the hill and got water. After dinner, a very nice group of three young men let me hang my bear bag with theirs. It helped tremendously with my anxiety. I made reservations at Fontana Village and now I am heading off to bed.

I was able to walk and truly enjoy the day considering I only had to go 8.7 miles and didn't have to worry about getting all set up before dark. The area from Cody Gap to Fontana is beautiful. Tons of views and I got my first food trail magic! Kiki was at Yellow Creek Mountain Rd grilling hamburgers and hotdogs. He is a former AT thru hiker and is heading off to hike the PCT in April of this year. The hamburger was absolutely amazing. After a little food and talking, I headed back up. I was so happy today to be outside that I didn't think about anything else but the few feet right in front of me. The last two days my knee has done great. My feet doing numb after about nine miles has been my only issue. If I rest for a few minutes, they recover just fine and I am able to keep walking. My only other issue is some chaffing/burn from the ride down the NOC. I am bright red from my waist down to the back of my knees. It still hurts to sit down, but I am sure it will heal up just fine. I resupplied at the General Store and bought twice as much food per day as I had been eating. I calculated the before calories and it was only about 1500. I am hoping that if I eat more I will be able to go further each day in the smokies. Just like last year, I am so nervous about the shelters. I have yet to sleep in a shelter basically due to all unfounded fears.   I am sure this year it won't be as crowded. Tomorrow, I am just going to the Fontana Hilton.

Almost everyone had gotten up early excited to finally be done with the Smokies. The day was a beautiful walk. It was hard on the knee but I was able to make pretty good time. The change in the vegetation as I moved down the mountain wasn't as dramatic as it was last year, but it was still beautiful. Last year, the lower I traveled the greener the trees and bushes became. I am about three weeks earlier than last year. Right now, all the new growth is just starting to emerge. Tiny green leaves and buds are just beginning to show themselves. The sides of the trail are lined with little white flowers that don't open until the sun touches them. Once I finally arrived at Davenport Gap, I was elated to be out.   The remaining miles to Green Corner Road were exhilarating. The trail follows a stream as it tumbles down the mountain. The sounds was music to my ears. As I neared the pavement right before I-40, I was greeted by two white butterflies dancing around the trail. Butterflies like rainbows have played a very significant role in my life. In my past, when I would lose something or someone very special to me... a butterfly would appear to let me know that all was well.   Since the horrible incident at my job in the end of 2015, I hadn't been comforted by the appearance of any butterflies. Maybe they were there, but my heart or my brain refused to see them. But as I stood on the trail and was circled time and time again, a peace overwhelmed me. I was able to breath a little easier. I crossed over the bridge and under I-40 crying tears of relief. I arrived at Green Corner Road and headed up to Standing Bear. I had originally planned to keep going up a couple of miles to camp. The emotional drain from the day had left me exhausted so I just camped at Standing Bear and prepared myself for the new that would start the following day. **Photos/Video on Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Cosby Knob Shelter

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558325,"I didn't sleep well at all. The gravel road seemed to have quite a bit of ""traffic"" and a rooster was confused about what time it was. But overall it was a pretty decent night. The first shelter was my goal for the day.   The first hill was a little easier than I expected and the views were great. It was interesting to see the stark contrast between the forest and the presence of man such as the power lines and towers. As I walked I was awestruck by the beauty of the new. I took my time and took picture after picture. Spider webs, flowers, fungus, and even a snake all peaked my interest. I still arrived at the shelter to early to stop. After the first climb of the day the clouds took over but as I approached the shelter, they started to clear. I made the decision to try to push on to camp on top of Max Patch. I really wanted to take full advantage of the tent before I got my hammock back in Hot Springs. The day went quickly but it was long. After 13.3 miles of walking, I was so excited to finally be done for the day. Earlier my first bald, Snowbird Mountain was shrouded in low clouds. It was eerie yet beautiful. But as I approached Max Patch, blue skies emerged. Shock and awe overwhelmed.   The wind was strong but I was truly inspired by the sight. I climbed the steps and continued to the downside of the Bald. I set up my tent and settled in. I watched an amazing sunset. The sky seemed to be on fire.   The winds died down a bit after dark and I was able to fall asleep despite the hound dog barking on some nearby property. **Photos/Video on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Green Corner Road

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558764,"The night sky on Max Patch was clear and the sky was a sea of stars. I was awestruck. The night was fairly uneventful after the barking and howling from the hound dogs in the distance. The only exception was about 2am when a pack of coyotes started having wild conversations with the moon. I woke up at my typical 5am and noticed that even though it hadn't rained at all the inside of my tent was very damp. The condensation was dripping from the rain fly through the big net and onto my quilt. I had a short day planned so I was hopeful I would get to dry it out. I retrieved my food bag shortly before the sun rose and made my breakfast of oatmeal and coffee. The sky lit up a brilliant red as the sun peaked over the mountain. I rigged up my phone with a hair rubber band and a trekking pole so that I could do a time lapse video. When the sun finally showed itself, the grass glistened with dew. The entire Bald was a sea of sparkles.   I tried to hang out a little while to see if my tent would dry some, but I finally gave up and just packed everything all up. The tent was more wet than when it had actually rained!!The walk down followed many streams and creeks. The rushing water was able to drown out the thoughts in my head for the majority of the day. I arrived at Walnut Mountain Shelter extremely early. I unpacked everything and strung it all up to dry. I laid on top of the hill and just listened to nature for a couple of hours while everything finally dried out. The sun finally fell down behind the mountain as the winds kicked up. After a couple of hours I was finally able to sleep.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558766,"The wind howled all night and continued into the morning. I didn't sleep well at all and finally retrieved my food about 6am. I got breakfast and as soon as it was light enough to see I fought the wind to pack up and start walking. My original plan was to go to the shelter right before Hot Springs but then within minutes of starting I decided to go all the way to Hot Springs. My tent would still be dry and I could mail it off. The day started out with sunshine but the clouds rolled in fairly quickly. It never actually rained but the threat was always there. I was going extremely fast for me and at about six miles in, I finally decided to stop and have a snack. I finally found a place to sit at an old dirt/gravel road. As I sat eating my beloved pop tart a monarch butterfly started circling me. She stayed for several minutes and even landed on my boot. Again emotions overwhelmed me and I was at a loss for what to do next. The rainbow, the white butterflies and now this one.   As I tried to make sense of it all, she fluttered off. Not just in any direction though. She took the trail north following the white blazes. And I followed.After I passed Deer Park Shelter, both my brain and body seemed to shut down. My feet were numb since they had passed the on fire stage. My brain was completely unfocused on the obstacles of the trail. I managed to fall forward twice within a mile of each other. The second time I busted my lip but was otherwise okay. When I finally arrived at Laughing Heart I was able to pick up my two large packages. They didn't have any private rooms so I went off in search of my very own shower. My first challenge was to get down the long flight of stone steps with my packages and my pack. I used muscles I didn't know I had. I was able to get a room for two nights at Alpine Court.   It was way more expensive than I was hoping but at least I had my own room. My biggest shock was the door to the outside had no deadbolt and the knob itself was very loose. I am pretty sure that even when locked, it would be fairly easy to push open. It seems odd to be that out in the woods, it's a bugnet between me and the world, but in the real world.... I need a deadbolt. I gathered my clothes and headed to the laundry mat. The laundry mat had no change machine so the nice people at the bank gave me change.   Once all my laundry was done, I headed back to the room for a shower. Then evening was spent opening my food resupply and my hammock. Once I finally got sleepy, I wedged a chair under the door and fell asleep.

I got my tent packed up and headed off to the post Office. They were closed from 11:30 till 1. I did go have a huge hamburger with a fellow female Hiker named Goat. The food at the Smokey Mountain Dinner was amazing. I ordered a salad to eat later and then went back to my room. It seemed to take all day to repackage food and get everything situated.

The first climb up the rocks was challenging with a day of rest. I really think my body hates me more after a zero! Sometime early last year, there was a fire around Hot Springs. All morning I keep stopping to look at the charred dead leaves on the tops of the trees and the new green growth at the bottoms. It's amazing how quickly the forest recovers. On one of my many stops, I noticed a fuzzy thing in the dead rhododendron leaves. It was a rusty reddish brown. As I peered closer I realized it was breathing! I took quite a few pictures and examined it closely without disturbing it.   I could see one tiny foot clasped around the stem of the leaf. I could make out maybe a wing. The face was hidden in the curled up leaf but I was pretty sure it was a bat of some sort. I could tell that I was making it nervous because the breathing rate increased. Finally I moved on, but continued to look at the leaves more closely hoping to find another. I finally arrived at Spring Mountain Shelter. I attempted to set up my hammock but I just couldn't get it right with the trees I picked. Definitely out of practice! As I fiddled around the tents on the top of the exploded. Two then five then I lost count. I took down my hammock and found two other trees that would work. I moved everything down and got situated.   After eating dinner, I finally went to sleep after the explosion of people quieted down.

Anyway, once I finally got going the day just seemed to drag on and on. Right before a Gap, a very awesome man named Yukon had Trail magic! It was a little too early for beer but I got a lovely honey bun as my morning snack. After the snack, The miles just seemed to never end. It was close to 80 degrees according to the thermometer on my watch. Finally I stopped at Little Laurel Shelter for water and another snack. I decided to climb big hill that afternoon rather than first thing in the morning. That mountain seemed to go up and up and up. The heat didn't help. When I thought I had another 0.8 to go up, the trail was blocked with logs and had been rerouted. The last up was cut off and instead followed the elevation line around the last peak. The Guthook app doesn't have the rerouted trail yet so it kept telling me I wasn't on the AT. The new trail section is beautiful and even passes over a couple of really good water sources.   Once the trail rejoined the AT on the other side, I started heading down to the piped spring and Campsite. As I was getting closer, I heard voices. As soon as I arrived, more trail magic. Yukon was now on this side of the mountain. He had coke and hotdogs. I cooked a couple of hot dogs on the fire. I was very grateful for the food. When in Hot Springs, I had planned a resupply at a hostel which I have learned is closed. With Yukons trail magic, I was able to save a couple of meals. I will still be cutting it pretty close to get to Erwin, but I think I'll be okay.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558781,"Today was definitely one of the most difficult days so far. The morning started out shrouded in fog. The forecast had predicted rain and possible storms so I got up early to get over Big Firescald Knob. As I approached the beginning, I debated on taking the bypass because the winds were really strong. I finally just decided to go for it. It was extremely difficult and in parts, I was crawling on my knees to keep from being blown off the side. I crawled up several parts hand over hand and then scooted down parts on my rear.   Even though it was difficult and I was scared, it was still exciting. The views mainly consisted of clouds and trees bending over backwards. Once I was done though, I was glad I went over. I stopped by Jerrys Cabin Shelter for a morning snack then continued on in the wind. Not long after that it started to rain. It rained for several miles and I forgot to put on my rain pants till it was too late.   A couple miles before the shelter, the rain let up and my pants started to dry out. At about 0.8 miles before Flint Mountain Shelter it started to rain again even harder. Up until that point my feet had stayed dry, but all of a sudden I felt like I was walking on water.   Once I arrived at the shelter, it was full of people trying to dry out even though it was early. I set up my tarp and then started trying to warm up. I put on my dry rain pants and after an hour or so I finally warmed up. I joined a few people at the fire they miraculously started and was able to dampen some of the moisture in my socks and shoes. I finally gave up, ate dinner and went to bed.   It was a long wet day but I managed to survive.

Cutting a few snacks makes a huge difference, I can't wait till tomorrow so that I can go back to full ""feeds"".   Between the rain yesterday and the short miles today, I cut back a little on food so that I would have enough to get to Erwin. All day today, I was looking forward to my peanut butter tortilla tomorrow. Other than obsessing about food, today was a beautiful spring day. Everything is transforming! The forest floor was dusted with tiny flowers and the moss was lime green. I crossed over/around a couple of cow fences and saw a rooster stalking guinea hens I think. This area seems more ""inhabited"" by humans. I saw houses in the distance from my mountain views. I could hear dogs barking in the valleys. Sadly there were also old tires lining the gorgeous stream as it tumbled down the mountain. Old barb wire lined the trail in several places and the occasional pieces of rusted farm equipment popped up. This area reminded me so much of the place where I grew up in Northwest Georgia.   I spent most of the day reminiscing but my brain was finally cleared by the clear blue sky and the daunting hills in front of me. I arrived at Hogback Shelter in the early afternoon. The area around this shelter is of course beautiful. There are so many trees, I could spend years counting them. The long walk to the water source was the only downside.   I was able to hang up everything and I think things are finally dry.

I had done 6.2 miles in around four hours which is really fast for me. I got signal for a little bit and was able to check the weather. It showed storms coming in a couple hours.   I got to Big Bald and it was just starting to sprinkle. The closer I got to the actually bare land, the wind was out of this world. The tiny drops of rain felt like they were digging holes in my face.   I felt like a ping pong ball in the bathtub just bouncing around. I got over the first bare area and dropped back down into the little trees.   I looked up and saw another Bald to go up and over. At about that time lightning struck just about on top of me.   As I was pretty much running up the hill, I heard a voice in the small trees. A guy was hanging out in there because of the lightning. We followed the tree line to the other side of the Bald. I could see the posts with the white blazes but I guess I wasn't technically on the AT. But I pretty much didn't want to die yet.

My 16.8 mile planned walk started at about 7am. The first climb up Little Bald Mountain was beautiful. The sun was trying to peek over the mountains but the clouds just kept fighting back. As I summitted Little Bald, the snow starting to fall. Big fluffy flakes. I stopped to quickly put on my pack and camera cover. I tried to take some video but the snow on my phone was making it so difficult to get the touch screen to respond. I finally gave up and continued to just walk. Off and on all day the snow/sleet would come pelting down. The wind would try to blow me off the trail. The climbs were so bad but the descents were harder. I arrived at No Business Knob Shelter by 12:30, sat down for about five minutes and kept walking. Most of the walk was on the side of the mountain. Almost straight up on one side and straight down on the other. I am always extremely careful because I am afraid of tumbling down. The climb out of Temple Hill Gap was a steady up but not too bad. The last climb of the day however seemed to go on and on. It seemed to go up, dip down, and then go up again. It was snowing again, so I decided to attempt my first ""eat and walk"". Mission accomplished! I didn't trip or choke so maybe I'll try again. When I finally reached the top, the brutal descent (in my opinion) began. Steep downs, switchbacks, more steep downs, etc. Those are my least favorite. My knees and the balls of my feet hate me. It took me almost two hours to go the last two miles. I arrived at Uncle Johnny's around 4pm. I was so excited that I managed to do 16.8 miles in one day. I now know that I can do it. My food bag had only trash and one breakfast so I am sure the lightweight helped. I also didn't stop to take many pictures. I missed doing that!I set up my hammock in the covered area, but also put up my tarp. The wind and blowing rain would have made for a miserable night. I went on the evening shuttle and splurged for Italian. It was absolutely delicious. I worried the entire time I was gone though about my tarp. When I got back, my tarp was blowing against my hammock. The stakes for my tarp absolutely refused to hold. I searched out large rocks and cinder blocks to try to secure it more.

I had more food as the pizza AYCE then went shopping. After repackaging all the food, I realized once again I have too much food! I tried to stuff it all in my zpacks bear bag but it just wasn't cooperating. I knew I shouldn't have bought those ramen! They aren't very squishable. After debating for a couple hours, I finally just went and bought an 18 liter food bag. I'm sure I'll find a use for the zpacks bag.

I tried to focus on the little things around me instead of the big picture and the future. The first couple of miles I ran into two people (not together) that were going back down to Uncle Johnny's. The temptation to join them was overwhelming. I had to remind myself that living in the past hinders my ability to move forward. Literally and figuratively. As I climbed my way up out of Erwin, I was greeted with a million signs of spring. Several trees had tiny leaves emerging. Flowers were blooming. The air had a different feel to it. I took quite a few photos that I believe really capture the tiny joys of the trail. I arrived at Curley Maple Shelter by 12:30. It was an interesting place but very limited on hammocking options. I decided to abandon my original plan and just keep walking. It was quite scary because I no dead set plan.

Most of the day seemed to be a series of ups that never ended accompanied by downs that pushed the limits of my knees and feet.

They seem to be everywhere and just pose so beautifully. Best of all is they don't seem to mind my company. Today I couldn't stop focusing on loneliness. I have never been a social person and have never truly been part of a group or family. Part of my soul longs to be a part of something bigger but the majority of my being has accepted the loneliness.   Regardless of my place ""in the real world"" on this trail I am gaining peace with myself.   I can walk, I can focus on the physical pain, and I can forget the past. A few miles of the walk today were spent walking through the woodpecker corridor.    I listened and watched them bang their heads on the trees all day. They are persistent little ones and I admire their strength and determination. They never see to give up!
The climb up to Roan High Knob Shelter was excruciating but definitely worth the pain. The evergreens were amazing. In many places, the ground was still covered with snow despite it being at least 70 degrees. In several places, large icicles dangled from the rocks. I could have stayed all day long.

I took my time and thoroughly took in all the beauty. I stopped at Overmountain Shelter for a quick lunch and kept walking. The sun was blazing but I finally managed to make it up Little Hump. Once I came out of the trees and got a glimpse of Big Hump Mountain, I almost turned around and camped. Fortunately the clouds floated over and Big Hump didn't look so impossible. 
Up and up I climbed until I finally reached the summit. I stood on top of that Bald and wished for a future. A future I could see as clearly as the mountains surrounding. A future I could feel as real as the gentle wind sweeping across the grass. A future I could love as much as the peace that overwhelmed me while I stood there. 
I finally made my way down the rocky winding trail to Doll Flats. The views of the valley took my breath away. I officially finished North Carolina and was happy to make another state off the list! I took the long walk down to the stream to get water. I heard a commotion in the woods and saw a large hawk. I am sure he was hunting but I was glad I didn't witness a kill. I think he missed.

Once I finally got going, the miles past very quickly.   I was at US19E in only a couple hours. I sat on the rocks for a little while debating on going down to Mountain Harbour B&B for another day of food. Finally I decided to walk downhill just to see. On the way down, a very nice lady with daffodils in her cup holder stopped and asked me if I needed a ride to town. I was able to hold my emotions in check long enough to decline and let her know I was only going a couple of tenths of a mile. I don't really understand why but her being so nice to me with absolutely no expectations in return sent me into an emotional tail spin.   On this trip, I have yet to hitchhike or even attempt it. I do not want to ask for anything for fear of being told no. So needless to say, I probably looked like a fool standing on the side of the road crying like a lost child. I finally made it down to the B&B. I bought my first Mountain House meal on the trail. I planned to lugthat and a block of cheese all the way up to Mountaineer Shelter for my dinner. 
As I came up from US19E, I was shocked at the amount of trash and junk thrown into the woods everywhere. That area was by far the trashy place I have seen so hard. If I make it through to the other side of this journey, I plan to come back and try to pick up and haul off as much as I can. 
The trail passed through some rolling hills, valleys, and meadows. At the top of on of the hills stood a lone tree. I was hoping my tears from earlier had moved on but of course the lone tree brought them back in force. Once I topped the hill, I stood under that tree and admired her ability to stand alone and survive. The hill and meadow past that tree was alive with birds, bees, and butterflies.   I sat up there for an hour and tried to convince myself to put the past behind me and just keep walking.   Finally I was able to leave enough of my mental load behind to pick up my pack and continue on. 
I passed by two beautiful waterfalls and finally arrived to an empty shelter. Since Erwin it seems as if the number of hikers has drastically decreased. I cooked an ate my mountains house chicken fajita bowl with cheese and an extra tortilla. It was by far my best dinner but also probably the most expensive. I definitely won't be able to do that often but it will be a great treat every once in a while. 
With another day finished, I finally was able to fall asleep and hope for a better brain day.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560962,"Starting off early I planned to head to Laurel Fork Shelter 17.8 miles away, but as the day wore on I knew that probably wasn't going to happen. I spent the day focusing on nothing but putting one foot in front of the other. Every time any other subject matter popped in my head, I replaced them with ""Walk, just keep walking."" That method works the majority of the day and then I almost stepped on a huge black snake. We had a nice photo session, then he left and I continued to walk. 
Close to Dennis Cove Road, I stopped to admire the old cabin which in my opinion is so full of life. At Dennis Cove Road, I was told about the campsites along the river. They aren't marked in AWOL. I stopped there for the night and decided to see Laurel Falls in the morning with fresh eyes and less tired legs. 
While I was there an amazing lady was there waiting on her husband while he fished. She had brought a grill and decided to cook for the hikers that came through while she waited. I had a hamburger with cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was delicious and kept me satisfied all through the night.

It was steep and very rocky, but well worth it! The falls were flowing full force and the roar kept me from hearing the not so pleasant thoughts still floating around. I had originally planned to go into Hampton on the side trail before Pond Mountain, but decided against carrying a full resupply over it. The climb never seemed to end going up. The ""view"" halfway up was a going resting spot while I tried to convince myself to continue up. Once I was finally up, the down was just as much fun!I finally made it to Shook Branch Road and went to Boots Off Hostel.   I sat up my hammock and then took an amazing shower. Once I was finally settled and laundry was finished, I was excited to see a couple of people familiar walk up the hills. I was hoping to run into them again because I enjoyed talking to them at camp in the evenings. One of the ladies was planning a makeshift Easter Dinner for the next evening. My plans for a night and resupply were replaced by a zero, when I was invited to the dinner. The evening was spent on a quick resupply trip into Dollar General and delicious junk food at McDonald's. Once we got back, the owner built a bonfire and the small group had s'mores. I stayed up pretty late but finally decided to call it a night. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Dennis Cove Road

I made the mistake of checking Facebook and learned April the Giraffe was in active labor. I spent the next two hours watching but did manage to multitask and get my food all ready for the next stretch. As the day wore on, I got more and more excited about our small Easter Dinner. I was looking forward to another quiet night. Of course, things never go as planned! The number of hikers arriving kept growing. By the time dinner was ready close to 30 people were at the hostel. Our small group split off and ate. A couple of people in the group wanted to go to church the next morning, then hike out. After much internal debate, I decided to go with them.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561266,"I didn't sleep very well and the stress of so many people in such a small area had sent my anxiety level over the edge the night before. My brain still hadn't recovered by morning but I decided to try to work my way through the muck and try to join the small group at church. We got a shuttle from the hostel to the church and the six of us piled in a pew. We were in our freshly washed Hiker attire while everyone else was in their Easter dresses and suits. The people were very welcoming.   I was raised in church and even attended a southern baptist college but I have always felt like I didn't belong. This church was no exception. To be trite, it's me, not them. For the millionth time in my life, I felt like a weedy dandelion in a garden full of beautiful roses. I managed to make in through the first few minutes of introductions and anniversaries.   They played one song then a few minutes of the message. Then came the second song. I have always been extremely music sensitive. It can take me higher than a kite or send me to the deepest darkness. The second song turned my world black. I managed to escape out the back before I imploded.   I hid behind a building trying to regain control. I stared at the mountains around and desperately wanted to transport myself back to the safety of the trail. The trail has been the only place I have ever found a touch of comfort and I needed to be back there. As I sat out there of course I wasn't alone. The birds sang and the butterflies danced around reminding me that they see my pain. As I waited and cried, two of the women in the group came to check on me. It was a comfort but also a fear that materialized. Someone has seen me at a weak moment. Will they take advantage of that and use it in the future? Will they judge my fears as irrational and put me in the outcast box?   Will I accept that comfort this one time to only be denied if I ever need it again? As I tried to put all my pieces back together, I sealed off that part of me and locked that little box. Church finally ended and the others came out. We started walking towards the restaurants in town. We ate at Subway and waited on the shuttle for a ride back to our packs. I was desperate to be in the woods again. I needed to walk off the pain in my head and give it to my body to process. We ended up back on the trail around 2 with grand plans to go 9 miles. Needless to say that didn't happen. Only a couple miles in, I went back for one of the other women who was in a well deserved panic mode herself due to the immaturity and creepiness of another hiker. We ended up only walking through the closed area around Watauga Lake then found a campsite right after. The two guys in the group went in search of water.It took forever for the guys to come back but not only did they bring water but they arrived in a convoy of vehicles with the most amazing trail magic. A generous family was at the lake having an Easter Dinner and they gave us all the leftovers!   We ate well and headed off to sleep grateful for full bellies. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Shook Branch Road

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561705,"Once again deep sleep eluded me, the events of the prior two days were weighing heavy on my mind. The highest of highs being invited to join in a ""tramily"" and the lowest of lows being reminded that my place in the world is as a uncertain as a sunny day on the Appalachian Trail. The day started out with the never ending uphill.   I started out before most of the group but before long they had pretty much all past me. I tried to take in my surroundings instead of letting the monsters in my head dominate. Unfortunately the guy from the text decided to slack pack in the opposite direction. The young lady was not far ahead when he stopped her. I was only a few paces behind.   He attempted to apologize to her but with the panic in her eyes I told him to just keep walking.   Regardless of whether the picture was a mistake or malicious, her fear is real. The rest of my day was spent trying to figure out how to ""fix it"". To give her the strength to overcome her fear. To figure out how to be in front of her and behind her at the same time. Needless to say, I walked and walked and never figured out the answers to my questions or the solution to my dilemma. We arrived at the campsite fairly early and had the leftover from the trail magic Easter Dinner.   A group decision was made to eat all of it because we no longer wanted to carry the extra weight.   Once we were all full, we threw our bear lines and were milling around talking. We noticed tiny little bugs covering the tyvek footprint of one of the tents. It was like waves of moving/jumping dirt. Excellent cell service and google revealed they were more than likely juvenile springtails. Harmless but still overwhelming.   We ended up pulling out the tyvek and using my sheet of polycro.   Then all of a sudden the sky opened up. Mountain Goat and I dashed to raise the bear bags thinking the rain would last for a while. Since darkness was now close we didn't want to have to go back out. Lesson learned. We ended up soaked to the bones for a 15 minute downpour.   And to top it off, the polycro didn't work out so well so we switched the tyvek back. That night the tiny springtails joined a few others in their tents and I was very happy to have my hammock. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Campsite after Wilbur Dam Road

We ended up with a late start and one group member decided to keep sleeping instead of packing up a wet tent. The terrain wasn't that bad and I thoroughly enjoyed walking through some gorgeous rolling pastures covered in dandelions as far as the eye could see. As soon as we entered the woods, the sky threatened rain again. My body was aching and my head pounding from the stress of the last few days. I was hoping that we would stop early but unfortunately it was not meant to be and we kept walking. We didn't arrive at Campsite until almost dark. I ate and then we attempted to hang all of our bear bags on a single deadish limb. Needless to say, the tree protested. We scrambled around and found another place to hang in the twilight.

The weather was mild with low clouds hanging out in the valleys and blue skies on the mountain tops. Flowers are blooming everywhere and all the trees have tiny leaves emerging from the buds on every branch. I was fascinated all day by the ability of trees and flowers to perpetuate life year after year despite all the hardships of snow and droughts and everything in between. I admire their strength and persistence. We stopped for lunch at a spot labeled ""Ruins"". However I am pretty sure someone ruined the ruins of the stone building by arranging them into a fire ring. I didn't sit long and headed out before anyone else. I was anticipating the crossing of the TN/VA border and I wanted to have a few minutes alone to process the milestone. When I arrived at the border, the blue of the sky was overwhelming. I held onto the sign and cried tears of happiness and fear. The crossing of another state line takes me further from my home state but closer to the inevitable end. It's a double edged sword over which I have absolutely no control. I walked a bit further down the trail through a trail teaming with butterflies.   Finally everything was so totally overwhelming that I just had to sit. Nature provided a log bench and I sat to collect myself. It wasn't long before the others showed up and we continued down the trail. One of the guys was behind and the other was making a dash into Damacus. We sat up camp right before Damacus to head in early the next morning.

And again my plans did not work out. I knew as soon as I stepped into the ""city"", it wasn't going to go well. Maybe I jinxed myself, but there were just certain signs unseen by others that this was a bad place for me. We walked down to the Broken Fiddle and a quick around the surroundings elicited a panic rising in my chest. I told them I wasn't staying there. They decided to go have breakfast to figure out where to stay. I was too sick to my stomach to eat so I headed down to the outfitters for shoes. I went to both outfitters and found a pair of trail runners I liked. I had them hold onto them while I went and picked up one of my Amazon packages. After going through my package and then buying the shoes, I started packing up things to send back to Atlanta. The group arrived with a cinnamon roll from me with notes from each of them written on the box. They all have such good hearts and filled with unmeasureable kindness. I am trying so hard to let myself feel that but it is truly one of the hardest things I have ever attempted. Climbing these mountains is a breeze compared to that.   They had all decided to stay at The Place but by this point I was having a hard time even staying in town at all. I decided to resupply at Dollar General while I tried to make up my mind.   Once I got all my food, I headed down to the hostel. I asked about hammocking and was told where the posts were. Once inside, the caretaker laughed and said so she is the ""fifth wheel"". Needless to day, my sense of belonging was decimated. I know he meant no harm but it was like a punch in the stomach. I quickly escaped outside to set up my hammock and hide. After trying to setup my hammock on posts that didn't seem like they wanted to hold me up, I decided to just head into the woods. I couldn't even think about going back into the building for a shower without tears welling up. I got all my food together and then made one last trip to the post office. I was walking out of Damacus by 4pm and was very happy to be leaving. I stopped right after crossing the road, filled up my water for the evening/morning and headed up. At the campsite someone had left a tarp set up. It took me a while to realize it was uninhabited. I tried to convince myself to eat dinner but I just wasn't very hungry so I just nibbled on the cinnamon roll. After I was in bed, I got a text saying the group was staying in town probably an extra day due to unforeseen circumstances.

I waited a few minutes before getting up trying to decide where I was heading for the day. My original idea to camp beside the river was scrapped when a flash flood warning popped up. I decided to just drink coffee and have breakfast while I decided. I got up and put on my hiking clothes and headed downhill for a bathroom break before retrieving my food bag. It was drizzling lightly but I didn't put on my rain gear since it only a light misting. On my way back up the hill, I all of a sudden got extremely hot, then in the next instant I was so cold. A rush of dizziness took over and I ended up on the ground laying on my back looking up at the tree tops and watching the drizzle coming down on me. I don't think I actually lost consciousness. After a couple of moments, I was able to get up and made my way to my food bag. I untied the rope and as the bear bag hit the ground so did I again. I laid there a bit longer until I felt as if I could get me and the food back to my hammock. Finally I made it back and got back in. I was definitely chilled and damp, but finally managed to warm up. It's racking my brain to figure out what was wrong when in dawned on me that over the last two days, I had barely eaten anything or even consumed much water. So between that and just being completely stressed out, I think was just too much. I decided to zero at the shelter and eat like I would if I was hiking. I texted the group that I was staying there and they said they would be up later that day. I was a complete bum all day. I read the majority of the book and used up most of my battery pack on journals and photos. I made a point to eat every few hours and drink lots of water. By afternoon, I felt much more like myself.

Lost Mountain was going to be our meeting place then we would decide from there. Within minutes of me heading out it started to rain. It rained a cold rain, every step of the 6.5 miles to Lost Mountain Shelter. I got dizzy a couple of times but then I would stop for a wet snack and all was well. When I arrived at the shelter, the quickest of us had already set up his tent. He was cold wet and miserable. I set up my hammock and joined him in the miserable world.

I watched the moisture being pulled from the long hanging clouds then felt it permeate every cell in body. As I walked, I was enticed to stop at each new plant I saw and wonder what they will look like in a few days. I saw many new flowers with their blossoms still wrapped up tightly waiting for just the right time to expose their beauty. The silence of other voices today was intoxicating. I relished in only hearing the random birds sing their songs. The entire mountain seemed to a rushing stream giggling and gurgling as it tumbled down to the valley. When a stream wasn't available to join, the water created its own path. The reflections of the trees and sky in the rippling puddles of water were mesmerizing. And now I cocooned tightly in my hammock with my headphones in with music blaring to drown out the noises all around. I miss the silence of the enchanted green forest just a few miles back.

Last night I was thinking about going into the General Store and Inn at Massie Gap. I had called and got prices but was still undecided until I woke up. The low mile days and the weather had my food supply very low. There is no way I would make it Marion. I talked to Carl Dew and he decided to come in with me to split the cost of the room. That definitely helped with the waste of money anxiety. The thoughts of a shower to wash away all the pain and tears of the week from hell was too much to pass up. The walk out of Elk Garden seemed much easier than I was anticipating. The clouds still hung low and drizzle filled the air.   Up and up I climbed.   When walking alone and really listening, the mountains seem to sing a song of peacefulness. Again, the majority of the trail today was a stream created by the path of least resistance.   I tried for a little while to avoid the ankle deep water and mud but finally gave in. Not long before Thomas Knob Shelter, I starting seeing the presents left behind by the ponies. I was excited to finally get to see them. When I came around the corner, I could see the top of the shelter and directly on the trail was a tiny brand new foal wobbling beside its mother. The guys in the shelter were feeding another pony and two more ponies were hanging out by the picnic table.   I took a few pictures and then decided to continue on. Dew was ahead and was planning to wait for me at the spur Trail for Massie Gap. After Thomas Knob, the trail became more muddy and more rocky. Today was the first days of rocks with no knee braces and I was amazed I managed to walk pretty much pain free. I came across more and more ponies. I took more pictures and just watched them graze. The rocks on the trail grew and soon it seemed more like scrambling than actually hiking. I squeezed pack and all through Fatman squeeze and continued on. The views today were pretty much nonexistent but I occasionally got glimpses of the rocky hills around. They were beautiful even topped with fog. I finally arrived at the 500 mile mark which was appropriately made of ponies poo and sticks.The General Store and Inn are awesome.   Dew and I are absolutely in love with the soft comfy carpeting.

The walk up wasn't hard at all and within the first mile, I was rewarded with the absolute most breathtaking sight.  The tops of the mountain jutted out from the low valley clouds making then appear as floating islands.  
The saying ""No man is an island"" I suppose has some truth but for some reason the longer I walk the more I feel as if my island is floating further and further away from the others.  I am desperately trying to find my place and be apart of the greater body of land but it's a task I am just not up to yet. 
Of course, I stood up too and took photos for a little while then starting walking again.  The sky was blue and the sun was warm.  The trail continued to be rocky and quite muddy but I managed to go almost a whole mile before I submerged my left foot ankle deep.   It was nice to have clean dry feet for a little while but I knew it wouldn't last.  
Up and over and around, I continued to walk.  I was definitely not paying attention to where I was going and ended up missing a turn in the trail.  I walked for almost a half mile down a fence before it dawned on me all the human prints has disappeared.  I backtracked and found the last white blaze and continued on the right trail.  Throughout the day, I saw a few more ponies and even a long horn steer. 
I eventually managed to meet up with the others in the group. They were planning a longer day, but by mile 10 my brain and body were just done for the day.   I ended up hammocking right before hurricane shelter. I ate all my extra food and went to bed.

I told her about one of my first experiences on a hill with a stick and she eventually was able to get us all moving.  I can't tell you how grateful I am to her for conquering her nervousness to help get us to the hotel as the clouds opened up. It was like watching a comedy of errors as Goat and I attempted to get all the packs out of the truck and loaded onto the baggage cart. Once they were all loaded we managed one doorway before they toppled.  Finally in the hallway we realized it was pointless since there was no elevator.    Once we carried all the packs up, I went back downstairs to wait for the others.  A few of the group arrived but we were still missing one.  Apparently they had found a different hitch and left a group member behind.  I was finally able to get in contact with him and went off in search of him since he wasn't feeling well. Once everyone had finally arrived, a few went off to Subway, while I stayed at the hotel eating all my extra food.  I updated as many Facebook photos as I could then finally headed back up to bed. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","USFS 86 Campsite mile 536.6

We ate Mexican food then headed a couple miles up the trail.  We stayed at a campsite down by a natural spring. It was calming and we all had a great time. Goat was more adventurous than either Dew or myself and jumped in the spring.  The cold water was definitely a shock. We all laid in the sunshine and tried to forget the horrible morning.  The plan for the next day was 13 miles.  Dew would run (or I should say walk really fast) back into town for his package while Goat and I headed forwarded.  Once Dew had the package, he would meet us in the evening.  The evening was spent laughing, reading, and occasionally just enjoying the silence. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","544.0 Atkins, VA

I of course was still quite skeptical.  After crossing the bridge and finding more signs, I found the trail magic.  I was in absolute disbelief.  The food included meatball subs and hotdogs. Coffee and Sodas. Snack cakes and broccoli and cauliflower. They even had cheese and hard boiled eggs.  I talked to the angels for a little while and found out the trail magic was in honor of a loved one lost to cancer after he completed the AT.  I was in tears, not only tears of joy for the food but also in tears because it was the perfect moment for me.  One man said that they picked this spot because they heard from their loved one that people were at a low sometimes after entering Virginia.  They wanted to offer a pick me up and hope to make a difference even if it just affected one Hiker. It definitely made a difference for me.

The campsite had multiple branches of a little stream surrounding it.  As usual, I was the first one out of camp and all was quiet on the trail.  I force myself to focus on the little things instead of worrying about the bigger picture which can sometimes seem so overwhelming.  The trail was a bit rocky in places and I started seeing more and more pink lady slippers.  At one point, I even sat down in the middle of the trail to take pictures.  Not long after that, more hikers seemed to pass which always make me feel so slow.  I think my body will always battle my brain over that matter.  Right before the road that leads to Trent's Grocery, a suspension appeared.  I tried to be brave and conquer yet another fear.  I did make it across but the nausea and panic took a little road walking to wear off.  At Trent's, I had a cheeseburger and it was delicious.  I am pretty sure in the ""real world"" a gas station hamburger warmed up in the microwave would not be nearly so tasty.  I picked up a jar of peanut butter and some tortillas, then headed back up the road.  A couple of local older men seemed to be oblivious to etiquette and were making comments about the body of a female Hiker that had just left.  Needless to say, it was making a bit uncomfortable.  Back in the woods, I felt so much better.  The wind blowing gently through the trees made the shadows of the leaves dance joyfully across the trail.   The new green leaves make the entire forest seem to glow with life.   Not long into my walk, I could already hear the falls rushing down in the distance.  The closer I got the louder they became.  It almost sounded like a train barreling down the track at full speed.   I found the trail down, and found Dew at the falls.  There were plenty of places for tents but my hammock was going to require a little creativity in the spot he picked.  I found a couple of trees that would work and set up my hammock but left the tarp rolled up.  Less than an hour later, Goat showed up.   Both Goat and Dew decided to cowboy camp on the rocks right by the falls.  I had never cowboy camped but decided I would join them.  We sat up out pads (dew let me borrow his almost length foam pad to supplement my shirt one.  They sat up on either side of me and we spent the evening watching the water tumble and the sky grow darker and darker.  The moon appeared before any of the stars and the water glowed.  Finally a few stars appeared but nothing as dramatic as I hope for.I was still awake at 10:30 when out of the blue rain drops started to fall from the mostly clear sky.  We all covered up our bags for the brief light shower.  Both Dew and Goat went back to sleep but I was still awake at 12:30am when another brief dusting of rain appeared. I finally just gave up on getting awesome star pictures and tried to go to sleep. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Campsite at 603.0

I was grumpy from minute one and I was worried about my underquilt.  Overnight the condensation made my quilt appear to be soaked.  I pretty much walked all day and never stopped for more than five minutes.  I only took a handful of photos and my mood never seemed to improve.  Not long before Sugar Run Gap, I found a surprise stream of water running across the trail.  I filled up and around that time Goat finally caught up with me even though she had left at least two full hours later than me. She sat down for a snack while I continued to walk.  At Sugar Run Gap, there was a small campsite and I decided I was done for the day.  I unpacked my quilts and hung them up to dry. They were more or less dry so most of my worries of the day were pointless.  Both Goat and Dew both eventually arrived and they decided to stop there as well.  The next day was only a 10 or so mile walk into Pearisburg. 
Once my hammock was all setup, I ate dinner, hung my bag and promptly holed up in my coccoon to try to make the blues go away.

The walk today was definitely my least favorite.  Maybe it was the leftover bad vibe from Pearisburg but the trail was not very enjoyable either.  
After the first mile, I walked along a four lane highway in what felt like a cage with no escape.  It crossed over a railroad track with a train carrying coal I believe. Dust was flying everywhere.  Then you walk under a bridge before heading back up into the woods.  
The trail climbs the mountain as the river gets further and further down.  I was amazed to see rocks wore smooth so high up away from the river.  Next I passed a dirt road which is called Landfill Rd. The stream has a sign that says non-potable water.  In other words, it's filled with the leachate/run-off from the landfill.  The trail is then littered with shotgun shells and other trash.  It wasn't long before the overwhelming smell of decomposition from the landfill filled the air.  Then off to the side of the trail on top of a rise was what appeared to be an abandoned car with the glass broken.  Then not far in front of that was an old tree house (maybe) high in an old oak tree.  Then there was an old camper/rv parked up there as well.  I kept walking as fast as I could with no break at all.  
I texted Goat and she waited for me at Pocahontas Rd.  I was very happy for cell service.  Once I was away from the area, I was finally able to stop and have a snack.  I was so happy to be heading up a less inhabitanted mountain.  
Finally I arrived at Rice Field Shelter.  It truly has one of my favorite views so far.  I sat on the edge and just enjoyed watching a hawk float on the wind.   I also took a few pictures of Goat while she enjoyed the view as well. Quite a few more people arrived to enjoy the view so I heading back over the cow stile and into my hammock set up away from the shelter.  
I got up once to look at the moon.  It came up behind the shelter and was bright orange.   I went through photos for a little while then finally turned everything off and hoped for good sleep.

Within the first mile my feet and lower legs were soaking wet from the brief morning rain that left the high grass saturated. I again decided that I needed to focus on the little things and took pictures instead of worrying.  The days walk was definitely much more pleasant.  Well at least until I started entering the area with dead fallen trees everywhere.   The area is still beautiful but it's heartbreaking to know that most of the fallen trees are due to the invasive gypsy moth.  The Pine Swamp Branch Shelter is even closed to overnight use because of so many dead still standing trees.  All day the sky had threatened downpours, and I was excited to reach The Captains before the rain started to fall.  A couple of people were camping besides the creek because Captains zip line was closed due to high water in the river.  I was going to try to be brave and go over it but I was secretly happy to not have to conquer that fear.  I set up my hammock on the only trees I could find.  It was far from idea but it would hold me up.   I was almost done putting up my tarp when it started to rain.  I sat under my tarp for a little while and ate dinner before actually putting up my hammock.  Goat arrived not too long afterwards and set up her tent behind my hammock.

I slowly made my way up.  I sat down and put my feet over the edge.  Goat climbed up and brought my phone.  I had left my big camera with my pack.  I only had one battery left and was saving it for Mcafee knob.  I took a couple pictures and enjoyed the beautiful scenery for a few minutes before I climbed back down.  I sat down in the shade for a few minutes before heading back up to start down to the campsite which was only 0.7 miles away.   Once my pack was back on, I tried to follow the white blazes painted on the rocks.   The trail at this point became a precarious rock scramble down.  A couple of metal rungs had been placed in one rock wall which made the slide down a bit more controlled.  Unfortunately the rocks continued.  I was absolutely terrified the entire time. I one point I even stopped to text Goat to let her know I was probably going to die.  For a few tenths of a mile, the terror continued.  I was in tears knowing that if I couldn't do this, there was no way I would ever survive further up north.  At one point, my pack hit the wall and sent me sliding down quicker than I intended.  I ended up with a bloody shin but managed to recover and not break my camera.  Goat finally caught up with me and we continued down.   Goat is so much more agile on the rocks than I am and yes her full trail name is Mountain Goat.   There was one more place where I threw down my poles and slithered down.  Behind me was one of the college kids who had been up at Dragons Tooth.  He seemed a bit annoyed that I was taking so long so I let him jump past.   It's so much harder to navigate and keep your balance when you have an extra 30 pounds dangling on your back.  At this point, I was almost in full panic mode.  The fear of falling, the fear of injury, the fear of not being able to finish. But mostly the fear of failing.   This journey is my last chance and I want to see it through to the end. Coming around one corner, I was so excited to see a trickle of water coming out of the rocks.  I had been carrying extra water since none was listed for the campsite we were headed for.   I filtered an extra liter and sat on the side trail and guzzled it down.  I felt a bit less panicky and was able to continue on. Finally we reached Lost Spectacles Gap.  The rhododendron trees everywhere were blooming.  I searched around for tent stakes and managed to find quite a few of all different shapes and sizes.  I felt like I had hit the jackpot. As we were eating, LadyBug and Flash arrived.  I hadn't seen them since the Smokies and was glad to see them.   Unfortunately all the stress of the day was weighing heavily on my soul, and I decided I just needed to head to bed. **Photos/Videos on Facebook - Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Campsite at 687.4

I sat outside for a few minutes and drank a coke before starting the road walk back to the trail. I stopped at the creek and collected water before heading up.  The trail went through some beautiful pastures then followed a creek for a while.   I stopped randomly just to enjoy the beauty and take a deep breath.  I passed through one cow stile that required a bit of creativity considering my pack and I wouldn't fit through.  Finally after a little climbing, I was heading forward again.  After the creek, I walked through another pasture.  When I stopped at the edge of the woods, I turned back to look behind me.  It was gorgeous and in the distance you could see Dragons Tooth far in the distance.  It was mind boggling to realize that I had just been there and I had walked to the place I was now standing.  Eventually I continued on looking forward to taking photos at Mcafee Knob.   I was a bit shocked to see the parking area before the knob packed.  There had to be 30 cars there.   My hopes immediately sank knowing there would be too many people at the top for me to be comfy playing around with my camera and remote.    I tried to tell myself it would all work out but my pace slowed to a crawl.   I shuffled along for a while then Goat passed by.   At Catawba Mountain Shelter, I joined Goat for a snack while we waited for some people to come back down.   It seemed as the comings and goings were about even so we finally headed on up. Finally we got to the knob. Thankfully there were only a half dozen people there when we arrived.  I got a few photos of Goat and then handed my camera to her on auto.  Over the next three hours, I made three trips out on the rock attempting to get a photo of myself I was happy with.   If so many people hadn't have been watching, I would have gone a dozen times.  After looking though the pictures, I still wasn't happy with the ""me"" in any of them.   I finally just gave up and headed down to the shelter.  At the shelter, I set up my hammock, ate dinner, and just went to bed. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Lost Spectacles Gap 700.7

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566419,"I was excited to be up before sunrise.  I successfully retrieved my food from the bear box without waking everyone up.  I had my breakfast and was walking by 6:30am.  For the first couple of hours, it was just me and the wildlife.  This mornings wildlife was a large black snake laying across the trail trying to catch some early rays and a chipmunk not quite awake enough to run before I got his photo. I was dreading Tinker Cliffs fearful they would be like Dragons Tooth.   I walked quickly wanting to get it over with.   Sadly not far before the cliffs, the tread on my right shoe peeled partially off.   I walked a few steps with it flopping before I decided to just dig out my knife and cut it off.  I was already planning on new shoes in Daleville because the sides of my Hokas were busting opening and for some odd reason making my heels hurt.  I was disappointed they only last 250 miles but I knew I couldn't walk in them anymore.   Within a mile of the shoe surgery, I could tell my feet were going to be in horrible shape by the time I got to Daleville.  My heels were throbbing and the pain almost unbearable.   But I just gritted my teeth and kept going.  Tinker Cliffs were amazing and not nearly as scary as I thought they would be.  A former through Hiker named Mouse I believe even gave me a handful of tiny snickers.   As the day wore on, it got hotter and hotter.  The water sources were further apart than I was used to.  I stopped at Lambert Meadows, drank a liter of water, had lunch, and filled up two more bottles for the long walk to the next water source.  The afternoon was filled with lizards, power lines, and sand.  It reminded me a lot of the desert.  It reaffirmed my notion that I could never do the PCT.  I had cell service and let Goat know that my feet were going to need a zero in Daleville.  I made a reservation for one night at the Quality Inn because I was really craving Cracker Barrel and it was only $10 dollars more than HoJo.  Out of curiosity, I opened my Uber app to see if the town had Uber.  I was amazed to see that yes they did and that picking me up from that exact spot on the Appalachian Trail (2 miles away from the road) and taking me to Quality Inn would only cost $9.56.   I really thought a helicopter would cost more than that!   After everything was all set up (not Uber just the hotel) I started walking again.   The sun was getting hotter and hotter and I was running low on water.  Finally, I started the endless switchbacks down, but was so happy to see shade.  I ended up crossing a tiny stream and stopped to drink water. I was feeling a bit woozy at that point but the water helped.  Goat caught up with me then and we kept walking toward Daleville.  I saw my first honeysuckle and convinced Goat to try it.  Oh the memories of childhood.   After crossing over, a small log bridge through a bog, I saw my first bear print (according to google).  Then I was surprised to see the trail littered with mulberries.  I couldn't reach any that were ripe, so Goat got a pass on trying those.   I hope at some point, she will get to try one.  They are my absolute favorite berry. Finally we emerged from the woods onto a four lane road.  It was such a shock.  My senses were completely overwhelmed.  We wades through traffic cones and rush hour traffic to get to Quality Inn.  I am surprised we made it alive.  At the hotel, we checked in.  The lady at the reception desk complimented us on our lack of smell.  I couldn't help but laugh.   Once in the room, we showered and rested for a few minutes.   For dinner, we had Cracker Barrel and it was delicious.  I think I drank at least two gallons of sweet tea.  All satisfied, we headed back to the hotel.   We never completely unpacked our bags because we had decided to Uber to the outfitters and then stay at the HoJo for our zero since it was closer to the trail.  **Photos/Video on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Campbell Shelter 712.7

Not dying was well worth the $6.   At the outfitters, I asked for a size 6.5 in a certain shoe, but of course they didn't have any.  The employee ended up bringing me all the shoes he had in a 6.5.   He found a couple of shoes on sale in size 6.  After trying on them all, I settled on the Adidas Terrex.  They felt the best and had enforcements in all the places I shredded on my last pair.  I picked up new bear line (mine was getting a little too short) and fuel as well.  I ran into the coffee shop and got an espresso milkshake to die for.  After filling up on coffee ice cream goodness, I headed into Kroger for a quick cheap resupply.  Once all the chores were completed, we walked arms full down to the HoJo.  Once settled in our room, I went down for coins for laundry.   He was out but did have detergent (which came in a baggie with a dryer sheet).  I managed to scrounge up enough quarters to wash and dry a load of laundry.  While the clothes going, I ended up updating as many photos on Facebook as I could and arranging my food.  The rest of the day was just bumming around resting my feet.   For dinner, we ordered pizza.  Late that night, we saw our first lightening bugs of the season while I downloaded and played with a star/constellation locator app.  I finally decided sleep was needed and headed off to bed. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","US220 (Daleville, VA) 728.1

The breaks in traffic made it feel a little less like The Frogger episode on our first day in Daleville.  Between US220 and US11, the sounds of nature were drowned out completely by the rush of cars.  I was however surprised to see two deer mulling around in the field.   After crossing the railroad tracks, I was ecstatic to hear birds again.   It was already sweltering and the birds made me a little happy.  Passing through the 0.6 miles corridor of private land, I saw a little gnome village at the base of a tree.  I was happy the little fellow was there.  It definitely didn't look new and I wondered how many feet he has seen trample by.   On flip side, I wonder how many people have walked past and never saw him and his tiny mailbox.  The highlight of my day was seeing a turtle relaxing on the side of the trail.  I could not resist stopping and taking a dozen photos.  Of course, he looks a bit skeptical of all the attention but was still extremely photogenic. The majority of the time I feel like the turtle or the tiny snail.  I keep trying to think if I ever actually pass anyone when walking.  I honestly can't think of one.  Sometimes people will stop for lunch and I'll pass but they quickly get ahead again.   My biggest struggle is not feeling like I am a failure.  I keep telling myself that I am moving north.  That I am making progress but it's still disheartening.   Shortly after Daleville, I reached the 1/3 completed milestone.  I am in shock that I have walked 730.1 miles.   I AM making progress.  Still battling the heat, I stopped on an uphill and caught a glimpse of an inchworm crawling on my arm.  I returned her to a tree.  I stood and watched her as she quickly inched her way up to eye level.   I definitely refuse to carry anything that can move that much quicker than me. As afternoon approached, the sky started to cloud over.  A few rumbles of thunder echoed in the distance.  I stopped to put on my pack cover and found my first tick crawling on my shoe.  After sending him back to the woods, I kept walking.   In the distance, I heard a siren much like a severe weather siren and I prepared for the worst.   As it started to rain, I put on my rain jacket but just kept walking.  A few more rumbles of thunder and a few lightening cracks made me move even quicker further downhill.    The downpour started but I was grateful it didn't last long.   I stopped at the stream before the Shelter and filled up on water.  The last half mile uphill took a little longer but I finally arrived safe and sound.  I set up my hammock, and ate dinner very early.   I was absolutely exhausted from the heat and just wanted to relax. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","US220 (Daleville, VA) 728.1

Maybe I will have another chance at some point.  Less than a mile before the foot bridge Goat caught up with me.  She breezed on by while I stopped again to change my camera battery.  I was hoping for an opportunity for some great pictures of the river and the footbridge.  I finally got to the foot bridge, took a few pictures before hurrying across.  In the parking lot on the other side, Goat and a few others were eating snacks before attempting to hitch into Glasgow. It was around 11:30amand the majority of the traffic were semis.  We tried for a little while before we got lucky.   A former thru Hiker was bringing people back up and offered to take the five of us into town.  We squeezed five packs in the back of the small SUV then four of us squeezed in the back with the fifth in the passengers seat.  The windy narrow road would have been hell to walk but safe in a vehicle we made it in no time at all. Our trail angel dropped us at the shelter in town behind the pizza place.   Sadly trash was everywhere and it was extremely muddy.  The smell of the port a potties was a bit overwhelming as well.  There had obviously been a group there before who had no respect for the kindness of the town. I found a place away from the shelter and toilets to set up my hammock. Goat sat up her tent on a little hill away from the shelter as well.   Once we were set up, we headed to Scotto's with a few other people.   I had a delicious cheesesteak and then headed over to Dollar General to resupply.  Once back at the shelter, I sat under my tarp and packed up my food for the next few days.   I plugged in my electronics in the shelter grateful to be able to charge my camera batteries.   I sat at the campfire for a little while after the completely inebriated Hiker disappeared for a while.  Eventually I went back to hammock to wait for dinner.

We were so excited and hopped in.  The last mile and a half of the walk up is a private road with a gate and a key pad.  We expected to only cut a mile off the walk, but the trail angel in the pickup had the code and took us within a half mile of the trail.  His ride cut almost 2 miles off our uphill walk.  I have never been so grateful in my entire life!  The walk up to Spy Rock and the Priest was beautiful and slow going.  My pack was once again heavy and I was generally just tired.   The last climb up to the Priest shelter went by more quickly as I talked to an amazing day Hiker named Jane.  It was very encouraging and kept my mind off my sore and painful heels.  We went down to the shelter and I looked for a place to hang my hammock.  I wasn't having much luck, so I dropped my pack and visited the privy.  As I approached the privy, the buzzing got louder and louder.   I opened the door and a cloud of flies exploded.   I shut the door and decided further back in the woods was a better option.  We filled up on water and then went back to the top of the hill to the campsite.   I found a place for my hammock and set up.   Immediately, bugs of all sorts managed to trap themselves under my tarp.  I left the doors open while I cooked and ate at the fire ring.   Thunderstorms were predicted for the afternoon and thunder occasionally rumbled but the skies stayed blue with puffy white clouds.  Once I was done with the evening chores, I headed to my hammock to relax and debate more on my sleep system.  I got up several times to shoo out all of the buzzing bugs.  I am not quite sure how they survive as a species since they can't figure out the escape route from under a tarp.   The sun finally set and thunder rumbled again.  A few distance lightning bolts lit up the sky.    The rain finally started and the storm even brought some hail.  The hail on the Cuben tarp was loud and scary.   At that point, I decided I would have less stress in the tent.  I may not be as comfy but at least I wouldn't worry as much.  It rained intermittently and a little more hail fell from the sky.  Finally about 2am, I fell asleep for just a few hours. **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","Piney River Campsite 818.8

I didn't think there would be much wildlife since the loud music, but I was definitely wrong.  A smaller bear was coming up the hill and was no more than 30 feet from me.   I immediately started shaking and stood up quickly.  Dizziness overwhelmed me but I managed to stay upright.  He/she looked over at me but continued to amble along.   I stood motionless shaking while it continued downhill.  I of course didn't manage to get a picture.   I stood there a few minutes longer when I heard more noise behind me.  Fortunately this time it was just two more hikers heading down in the same direction as me.  Once I was moving again, every movement in the forest sent my heart racing. I made it to the next Overlook before stopping and having a little breakdown.   I waited a few minutes and then Goat appeared.   We walked together for a little while before her long legs took her further ahead. At the Parking lot before the Tye River, I sat down with Goat for a snack.  As I ate two dogs visited the parking lot, one was a larger brown dog who looked to be in pretty good shape.  The other dog was a smaller black dog with its fur completely matted up.   It absolutely broke my heart that I couldn't help them.   For years, I was a person that would do everything in my power to help the forgotten.  I sat in that lot and just cried because for the first time, I had to leave them be and hope someone else would help them.  I would like to believe that a good soul passing though would do something, but the reality is they will probably continue to live that way until they starve or are hit by a car on that windy mountain road.   Finally unable to stand it any longer, I started walking.  I crossed the suspension bridge and started up.  At that point, the rain started.  It rained and rained and rained.   The trail was muddy and all uphill.  My heels were screaming but I just kept walking.  I never stopped on to put on my rain jacket and was drenched head to toe.  Not long before the shelter, a newly fallen tree blocked the trail.  I was too short to even attempt to crawl over.  I stood in the rain and tried to figure out what to do.  Finally I just dropped to my belly and crawled under.  My pack and I barely fit through.  On the other side, I stood up covered in mud and leaves.  The tears started up again and I just kept walking.  I finally made it to Harpers Creek Shelter.  I sat my tarp and sat under it for an hour waiting for the rain to stop.  Around 2:30 it finally stopped, and emerged to find Goat at the shelter.  Getting to the shelter requires crossing the creek which was of course higher than normal.  I ended up even wetter as I slid off the barely exposed rocks.   I asked Goat if she wanted to keep going or stop for the day.  More storms were still in the forecast and I didn't want to be climbing Three Ridges in hail and storms.   We ended up calling it a day.  I crossed back over the creek and sat up my hammock, changed clothes, and crawled in.   I spent the afternoon trying to figure out whether to continue walking or just give up.  My feet refuse to let me walk more than 13 to 14 miles a day.  My brain and rest of my body want to go further each day.   At this rate, I will never make it to Katahdin.   That afternoon was definitely the lowest I have been on this entire trip so far.  After a couple of hours, I forced myself to eat my snickers labeled ""Crabby"" which seemed totally appropriate.   Supper followed and then darkness.   Only a small storm with a tiny amount of hail rolled through.   I realized how pointless it is to rely on the forecast.  **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow)","The Priest Shelter 827.3

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567030,"Morning arrived and as much as I didn't even want to get up, I forced myself to start walking.  I was dreading the climb up Three Ridges.   I climbed and climbed and as a reward I did get a few amazing views of the clouds settled in the valley below.   Once I made it to the top, relief set in as I walked down. The sun shining helped to improve my mood. I crossed over the Blue Ridge Parkway a couple of times.  The last mile or so to the Dripping Rock parking on the BRP was nothing but slippery rocks.   After several missteps and almost falls, I slowed to a crawl nursing my new bruises, sore ankles, and aching heels. 
I arrived at the parking area and was greeted by an amazing group of people cooking baked potatoes and pork chops for a Memorial Day Trail Magic celebration.   I ate and felt a little better.  I only stayed a little while before continuing to walk.  Goat and I planned on camping somewhere around the area but ended up walking a mile further to an unmarked campsite before the trail to the picnic area.  
I sat up my hammock and ate my last snickers labeled ""Cray Cray"".   I had bought the Snickers in Montebello and since they were behind the counter, the cashier picked out the words. So apparently, she knew me well.  
I went to bed before the sunset, and tried to enjoy my last night in the hammock.

I vented the underquilt as much as I could and still was hot.   It's a 20 degree quilt and while I know a 40 or 50 degree quilt would help, it just not money I can afford to spend.  I finally just gave up and sat under the tarp about 5am.   I had breakfast and started walking.    The terrain was fairly easy and I made good progress.  The mostly downhill gave my heels a much needed break.  Goat was up early as well and passed by quickly.  Not far before the trail to The Rocks, I saw Goat stopped on the trail.  She said she saw a bear fall out of a tree when the limb broke and she had waited on me.   We walked forward and saw him sitting on the ground at the top of the rise.  I was able to get a couple of picture before he walked further away down the back of the hill.   I was able to keep up for a little while with Goat but of course that didn't last long.  My fear finally eased and I enjoyed noticing all the red efts that were out and about.  Under one bush along the side of the trail, I saw three in very close proximity to another another.  I ate a snack while walking and finally made it to Paul C. Wolfe Shelter.  I stopped for another snack and then started up the last small climb.  I saw a fascinating flower or fungus.  I am not quite sure which.  It was completely white. The stem, the leaves, and the petals.   Absolutely no chlorophyll at all.  I took several photos and hopefully will be able to figure out what it is.  I stopped by the small graveyard and then stopped at the chimney as well. I started not feeling well after eating a tortilla with cheese but kept going hoping to get to the Gap quicker.  The last mile was done in what seemed like an instant.   At Rockfish Gap, Goat was waiting and was such a sweetheart to have gotten me a coke while she waited.  Another group of hikers had called a shuttle from the list of volunteers, and he was kind enough to take Goat and I to the Quality Inn.  After getting all checked in for my first double zero, we showered and splurged on Dominos Pizza.  We went ahead and walked to the Laundromat and got all clothes all clean. I finally found a scale and was disappointed to see that in walking 860 miles, I have only lost 7 pounds.   I was glad to see I hadn't gained weight though. The evening was spent relaxing and trying to ease my heel pain.

The redness is pretty much gone and I am hopeful they will not be as painful. I have several new pairs of socks to try and a few other things to try.   I guess tomorrow, we will see.  I have also decided in Luray, I will try to save money by mailing myself food instead of buying it at the small stores.   My staples are oatmeal, peanut butter, tortillas, and mashed potatoes.  At the small stores, they tend to be twice as expensive.  I will try that for a while to see if it ends up helping.   Currently, I am sitting outside in a patch of grass by my hotel room.   I know I could be laying in the bed in the room but I am enjoying the sun.  I am hoping the sun will help with the depression and fear of failure.  I know I am asking a lot of the big ball of fire but I definitely need a boost.  On days that I am walking I have an end goal and I know that regardless of walking one mile or 13 miles, I am making progress.   On these two zero days, the lack of forward motion has left me feeling as if I have accomplished nothing.  I logically know the zero days were needed for my physical health, but balancing the physical with the mental is frustrating.   I have always read and heard that if you aren't having fun and aren't enjoying yourself to ""go home"". I think that may apply to some or maybe even most but for me, this journey is more about overcoming fears, learning not to escape back to my hole when I am not in a good place.   The majority of my being right now wants to find my way back to Atlanta, crawl into my truck and just hide away staring at the reflectix covering the windows.   The reality is that is probably the most unhealthy thing to do.  Depression and anxiety have ruled my entire life.  I have had moments where I felt like I accomplished something important, helped someone or something in desperate need.   I made a positive difference in the lives of others.  The focus of this journey for me is to make a positive difference in my life.   Whether this depression and anxiety sucking the life out of me is the ""Virginia Blues"" or just the ""old"" me trying to take over, I will keep walking North until my body gives out.  I have seen things on this journey I never thought I would see.  I have experienced moments of clarity when focusing on the tiny things many people never notice.  I have glimpsed the world floating in a rain drop dangling from a leaf and experienced my life being turned upside down.  I have been encouraged seeing the clouds swept away by the winds to reveal a bright blue sky full of warmth.  I will keep walking until my clouds are pushed away to reveal the answers I am hoping will become apparent.  **Photos/Videos on Facebook -- Mickie Blair (Dicey Willow).","Waynesboro, VA

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567956,"I am not sure why it's so hard to get motivated on the mornings that I am heading back to the trail. Today was no exception.  My mind was filled with doubts about even continuing, and my body just didn't want to move.   I know that I didn't want to stay in Waynesboro forever, and I know that it's just too painful to go back to Atlanta.  The trail at least throws in enough physical pain and exhaustion that it is the lesser of all the evils.   Even though walking day after day is arduous at least I know that I am accomplishing something.  I am seeing beauty I have never seen before and feeling a peace even if it's only for a fraction of a section at a time.  I am hoping that peace will last just a bit longer each time. 
An amazing trail angel picked us up from the hotel and dropped us at Rockfish Gap.  We walked the road for a few minutes before heading back into the woods.  I stopped at the self registration kiosk and filled out a permit for SNP and then up I went.  
The trail was a slow climb up and was for the majority peaceful.  I crossed Skyline Drive for the first time and when looking to the left, the road seemed to end in the sky.   I found that most appropriate.  I walked by blackberry bushes covered in tiny fruit just starting to emerge.   I am hoping that my timing will allow me to have a few as I go north.  I am definitely not going at a fast pace so fingers crossed!
The grass on both sides of the trail got taller and taller.  I felt as if I was shrinking!  I know ticks are bad this year and I am hoping that by keeping a close eye on myself I won't end up with the dreaded Lyme disease.   
I saw a tiny fawn walking with its mother and was in awe.  I hope that it grows up big and strong.  The only other wildlife of the day was a rabbit munching in the tall grass right beside the trail.  I took photos for a while before he finally hopped off.  
We got to Calf Mountain Shelter and I took my time setting up my tent for the first time since Hot Springs.  I did a pretty good job on site selection and tried to arrange my new house while I waited for dinner time.  My heels were in surprisingly good shape and I was starting to feel a bit more at ease about being back on the trail. 
After dinner, we watched as people put their food up on the bear pole.  I didn't want to look like a fool since it was my first time.  When my turn came, I tried and tried but I just wasn't tall enough!   A kind gentlemen finally helped and was an early riser so he could help me get it down in the morning.   
Darkness finally came, and I zipped up the tent.  I arranged for a bit longer then finally decided to try to sleep.

I was fully awake around 5am but I knew getting my food bag down would be impossible.  I took a trip to the privy and then waited by the pole to see if anyone tall enough could help.  Unfortunately everyone else was still asleep.  
As the sun began to show its weary head, more people started moving around.  Through my ""window"" on the head end of the tent, I notice a ""tall"" guy heading to the food pole.  I escaped my tent and managed to make it in time for him to get mine down as well. 
 It took twice as long to get packed up and moving.  Once I was finally walking, I focused on just getting to the days end.  My thoughts were spinning and my sadness was blooming until out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the trees above me. 
On top of the hill, three or four deer were munching away.   One stared directly at me, then appeared to shrug his shoulders and keep eating. On closer inspection, all of them were boys.  I assumed male deer tended to be loners but this group was obviously well acquainted.  
Once I finally gave up taking pictures, I went back to walking.  The day seemed to go by slowly and I felt as if I crossed Skyline Drive a million times.  The sounds of cars and motorcycles never seemed to stop.  
I ended up counting my steps just to keep my mind from drifting.  I did run across several new flowers blooming and stopped to photograph them.  I am looking forward to unlimited battery life and internet one day to look them all up.  
After crossing Skyline Drive yet, I finally climbed the last hill of the day then descended down to Blackrock Hut.  The ground in the area is pretty much rocks.  I finally found the least rocky tent pad and set up for the night.   
On my search for a home for the night, I noticed someone had moved a big rock over to the bear pole behind the shelter.  I had my fingers crossed this would help my reach!
After dinner, I decided to give it a try. I was so happy to hang my food on the hook with no assistance.  
Shortly before dark, the whippoorwills started their song.  Louder and louder.  It is absolutely amazing to hear.  I would much rather hear them than roaring motorcycles.

Some mornings I just really don't want to walk but I know that progress is imperative.     My first climb of the day resulted in an awesome view from Blackrock.  I was happy to see mainly mountains, a blue sky and the wispy clouds of the morning.   I didn't see any asphalt or man made developments.   On the way down Blackrock, I was dodging inchworm dangling from their shimmering threads all over the trail.  I tried to take pictures but the slight breeze made it very hard to keep the photo in focus.  I did have a good time though. Always up for a challenge.  
Several people had mentioned a bobcat roaming around the trail near Dundo Campground.   I was on high alert but of course I never caught a glimpse of him/her.  I was hoping for a photo.  Goat who came through an hour or two later did get to see it though.  
Small up and downs all days were exhausting and I felt like I crossed Skyline Drive a dozen times.   Around Loft Mountain Campground, the trail exploded with people and I tried to hurry through.   A few hundred feet past the second Frazier Discovery Trail intersection, a noise I have never heard before stopped me in my tracks.   It was loud and urgent.  I scanned around and found the source.  On the side of the trail was a large rattlesnake announcing his presence.   I of course started taking pictures.   He was slow to move into the taller grass but I kept an eye on him.   A group was coming down from the campground for a morning stroll but when I told them about the rattlesnake they decided to head back to their RV at the campground.  Once it quieted back down the rattlesnake decided to cross back over the trail and head in the other direction.  
More ups and more downs and we finally arrived at Simmons Gap. We were going to get water there and then try to find a place to camp.   Unfortunately we couldn't find much close, but Goat left her pack and ""ran"" up the mountain for about 0.3 and found not only a cleared Campsite but also a water source.   We loaded up our packs and headed up.   We camped with a few others and waited on the predicted rain.

I put on my headlamp and shoes and got up as quickly as I could and hobbled on stiff sore ankles and feet to get my bag before the ""real"" rain started.  
I safely made it back to my tent without falling. I made coffee and breakfast in the light rain. I waited as long as I could but finally packed up and starting walking.   Within a couple of minutes of walking, A huge downed tree blocked the trail.  It looked like several people had gone over but I tried to figure out a way around.  I glanced down and saw a shiny object on the ground.  It was an iPhone.  I turned it over and the screen was intact.  I pushed the home button and it came on.  It was locked but it still had 26% percent battery and wasn't in airplane mode. It didn't have a signal though.  I figured it had been lost the day before.  I added it to my ziplock with my phone and kept walking.  At the top of the first hill, I turned on my phone and checked the found phone.  It had service.   Notifications started popping up and I took note of the names.  I used Facebook to try to let someone know that I was turning in the found phone to a ranger.  
I kept walking in the light rain. The day just seemed to be overcast and my head just seemed to wonder around. I also got a message from Dew saying he was going to come up and hike with us for a while.  I was very excited at the possibility of seeing him again. 
At the top of the next hill, an excited young man came running up and asked about the found phone.  I had let everyone know that passed in either direction about the phone.  Apparently someone who passed heading north as well had came across the owner and he was waiting for me.   I returned the phone and was happy I didn't have to take the side trip to the ranger station!
More up and downs.  The clouds prevent any views at all but it was still a beautiful of course.  I crossed Skyline Drive a few more times.  At South River Picnic area, I meet Goat and we loaded up on water.   We walked another mile or so and found a campsite.   I had gotten a message from Dew that he wasn't going to be able to join us after all.  His Achilles had swollen up and just decided to head back to Arkansas.   I was heartbroken that I wouldn't get to see him again.   
I was hoping on this trail to finally make a good friend or two to kept in touch with for the rest of my life but those odds are definitely dwindling.   I have never made friends easily.  My shy and introverted ways have not at all changed out here.  I have pretty much determined that I am ""a party of one"" type.  Whether I like it or not, it is just the kind of person I am.  It's probably for the best though.   Expectations only produce disappointments and hopes only exacerbate failures.

I kept thinking one down only a million more to go.   As I was walking down the trail, I saw movement ahead and immediately stopped.  A very large bear was digging around in the grass that lined the dirt about 20 yards in front of me. I stopped and banged my poles and started talking. Not yelling.   He moved a couple of steps to the side of the trail and continued to forage. He glanced at me a couple of times but kept chowing down on leaves.  He moved a log and ate some bugs maybe.  I tried talking more and banging more. He didn't even look up and went to the other side of the trail.  He plopped down on the ground, rolled for a minute, then moved a log with one paw while still laying down.  He rolled back toward me and was laying down digging with one paw. I took a photo was when he raised up for a bite of something good.  I kept trying to get him to move further away from the trail so I could pass but he ignored me.  I finally walked sideways by while he continued to eat.   
After I was a down the hill, I was finally able to relax a little and kept walking, but every dark stump in the woods become a bear and I was of course jumpy.

When I reached the trail up to Mary's Rock, I dropped my pack and went up anyway.  I took my camera and remote and was hoping to take some photos while I waited on Goat to arrive so we could let the shuttle know our eta at Thornton Gap.  
Once at the top, I could see the sun trying was just starting to make its way through the clouds.  Little specks of blue skies started to appear.  I set up my camera and was almost ready to try when Goat arrived.   I am extremely self conscious so my original plans were laid aside for just the typical pictures.   I took pictures of Goat as well.  
At that point the temperature was rising, and my camera started to fog up.  Most of the pictures didn't turn out at all. Looking back at that moment now (I am writing this much later), that was the moment I realized that this trip wasn't going to turn out like I hoped at all.  
I followed Goat down the mountain on the rocks.  Like every day, I kept turning my ankles as the my feet and head throbbed.  I had a hoped an amazing set of picture would renew my hopes.  
Once at Thornton Gap, we were picked up and taken to the hostel.  I sat up my tent outside and hid away until the resupply trip.   Once back from that I again holed away in my tent after trying to be social for a while.  
At the campfire by the house, I could hear laughter and conversation.   Not long after that though, I heard a noise that sent me into a complete panic attack.  I know I am being vague but I don't want to be judged or made fun of for being ""so sensitive"".  To most people this noise is just there occasionally, most people don't even bat an eye.   After a while, I managed to calm down.  In my heart at that moment, I knew it was done.  The trail would not hold the answers and the hurt in my heart would never go away.   Regardless of how far I walk, I will always have those memories fresh in my mind.

After another break, I found what I was looking for.  A swallowtail butterfly.  She was on a bush.  Her left wings were fully expanded.   Her right wings were still crinkled as she fought to stay hidden in the leaves.   She would flutter and try to fly but with only half of what she needed she couldn't take off.  Logically, I know she had just emerged from her cocoon. Logically, I know that she eventually her wings would fully expand and she would fly away.   But I just saw her as broken.  Only half of what she needed to be.

I finally arrived at our chosen campsite near the Range View Cabin.  We sat up our tents and I found a tree to hang our bear line.  We were sitting around the tents when we heard rustling in the woods.  A young bear was no more than fifty feet from us.  We talked and made noise but he only slowly moved away.  He crossed the trail underneath the paracord for our food. He stopped and sniffed the rope before moving on.  I am pretty sure he was making notes for later.  I took down the rope and moved it further away.  
We ate dinner in the middle of the trail away from the tents and then bedded down for the evening. Not long before dark we heard more rustling directly behind the tents.   Luckily it was only a deer was foraging for supper.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569892,"I was excited to see our food still hanging proudly in the morning.  After breakfast the walking began.  It was my last day in the Shenandoahs and I was ready to be done.  The day was a long one and my foot was still swollen from the day before.  
I tried all day to ignore the pain in my foot but the more I focused on not coming down to hard on my right foot the more times I rolled my left ankle in.   Every single step was carefully planned.  I tried to take as many pictures as I could but they all just seemed so dark and bland.   A reflection of my mood, I am sure.  
Towards the end of the day, I crossed Skyline line for the last time.   The descent out after the Shenandoahs was absolutely nothing but rocks.  I could I manage to find a way to get down without basically putting all my weight on my poles.   I was terrified I would snap one and go tumbling down.  
Goat caught up right after I was down.  Eventually I made it to the shelter.  The trip down to the water at Tom Floyd was long and rocky, but I eventually succeeded.  
I had a hard time finding a way to set up my tent.  The tent pad was rocky and had huge holes in it.  Eventually I just made due.  
Dinner and bed were my only remaining chores for the evening.

We finally arrived at Dicks Dome Shelter right before dark.   I laid in my tent and watched the fireflies light up the sky.   I basically cried myself to sleep as my head and feet throbbed.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569894,"The entire night before and all morning was spent dreading the beginning of The Roller Coaster.   I loaded up and starting walking.
I made it to Sky Meadows State Park fairly early and was greeted by rabbits everywhere.  They hopped and bounced pretty much every where I could see.   It was an absolutely beautiful area and for the first time in quite a while I actually felt a little piece of calm enter my soul.   
That was replaced a little bit later with dread as I climbed the first hill of the Roller Coaster.  The second brought more of the same.  At Morgan Mill, I ran across amazing trail magic and got to sit for just a little while before moving on.   Not long after, I came across a beautiful stream.  There were a couple of flat areas for tents.  I decided to just call it quits.  I took off my pack and sat on a rock by the stream.  I removed my shoes and sat for at least 30 minutes with my feet in the ice cold water.  When I finally got up, they were ice cold and only slightly blue!   
Goat arrived, we sat around for a little while.  I found a limb for the food and attempted to hang our food.   When pulling it up, I slid off the edge of a bank and landed hard on the all of my already painful right foot.   I managed to get up without letting the food bag fall to the ground.  I was actually pretty proud of myself for that.  
The owls started to talk and the raging of the water in the stream instilled a little bit of peace and I tried to prepare for more of the Roller Coaster.

Today was the day, I would cross the 1000 mile mark on my journey.  When I finally arrived at the spot, I took a while to really think about how far I had walked.  I thought about all the little things I was enamored by.  I thought about the days and days of rain.  I focused on the moments I smiled at chipmunks going nuts over nuts.  I tried to convince myself that I could and would keep going.  No pain, No Rain, No Maine.   And for me, I 100% believed I could leave my past behind on top of Katadhin.  That she would absorb it all and that I could finally be free.  I left that spot telling myself to just keep walking.  That once I got my boots back, the walking would be less painful.  That everything would be okay.
It was only a few more miles to Bears Den Hostel, so I walked with my head high and taking deep breaths.  
At the hostel,I showered then waited till the afternoon to find out where to set up my tent.  The hostel was full by 5 and we went up to the store to pay and retrieve packages.   
Dinner was a frozen pizza cooked to perfection, but I wasn't able to eat much.  The last few days my appetite had been pretty much non existent.  I ate a little and went to my tent.  
I picked up my laundry from inside later but pretty much relaxed in the grass all evening after packing up my food.

I crossed into West Virginia for the first time and thought about soon finishing two mores states.

I stumbled into the campsite dizzy and exhausted.   I got water and sat up my tent.   When I was laying out my footprint I saw a ball of leaves stuck to the bottom with spider webs.  I pulled it off and dropped it on the ground.  Out of the leaves rolled a black widow.  And the web was teaming with her tiny offspring.  She rolled herself into a tiny ball for protection.  So not only did I carry pack house 18.2 miles but I carried hers as well.  I felt incredibly guilty.   I gently moved her into the woods away from the campsites and then retrieved the ball of leaves and gave them back to her.   I apologized and wished her the best.  I know they are poisonous but I still felt bad.   After finishing with the tent, I forced myself to eat cold mashed potatoes and then went to bed with a pounding migraine and pounding feet.

Dicey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569908,"I had checked the tracking on my boots the night before and saw they had not been updated for several days.  I kept telling myself they were there and that they had just not been scanned.  I tried not to think about it all night.  At first light I started walking,  I wanted to get to the post office before they closed at noon.  It was 6.4 Trail miles and then a 1.5 mile road walk into Smithburg.  Since I am so slow it was cutting it extremely close.  
Once the post office opened, I called and asked about packages.  She only had two packages (socks, dehydrated spinach and a box of small gear replacement items).  I was crushed and at that point I had non idea what I was going to do.  Every step was horrible.  I still had to hurry for the other boxes and I finally made it to the road.   The road was Winding narrow two lane with absolutely no shoulder.  I walked on the edge but kept having to step off for cars. Pretty much every other step down my ankle was turning in as I gasped in pain.  With only about .4 miles to go a kind couple pulled over and took me the rest of the way.  
I got my boxes and tried to figure out what to do.  Goat arrived and we decided to zero in Hagerstown so that I could get boots at Dicks.  I called Dicks and they had no boots in my size.  I figured I could at least get ankle braces until my boots were located or I could get rei to ship me new ones. 
We ate at the deli/market and then was amazingly able to get Uber to take us to a hotel in Hagerstown.   The hotel was absolutely horrible to Goat and we both ended up in tears for different reasons.  After some phone calls, we were finally able to get into the room.  
I posted on the AT Women's group and an amazing lady offered to take me to Dicks the next day.  
We had picked the hotel because it had a coin laundry.  I went to the desk for change but she didn't have any. Then I walked to gas station to get quarters.  On the way back, I saw someone had a load going with only 15 minutes remaining.  I went upstairs and gathered our laundry.  By the time I got back down a temporarily out of order sign had been posted.   Apparently a leak above the laundry was flooding the floor.   It was a few hours but I finally managed to get permission to wash our clothes. 
We had pizza for dinner and I ordered boots and ankle braces to be shipped to Boiling Springs.

As I started walking in my new boots, I kept telling myself that all the pain would disappear.   But within, a mile I was in tears.  I stopped very few feet to catch my breath.  I cried mile after mile.  I knew everything at that point was just over.  Different boots, ankles braces, handful after handful of ibuprofen and Tylenol were not going to get me to Katadhin.  I just kept walking.  I didn't have a choice.  I kept telling myself I had to at least go halfway.   Halfway just like the butterfly on the bush.   
I left Maryland and entered Pennsylvania.   I took pictures at the Mason Dixon Line sign.  On the mailbox was a rock painted with Katadhin is calling.   I sat down and just cried.

Just walk I told myself.  Today was the day I would cross the official halfway.  
I walked and walked.  I turned on my phone to check distance and a voicemail popped up on my phone.  The message was from a lady in Atlanta who I used to help whenever she needed it.   She needed something simple.  I spent an hour begging and begging for someone in Atlanta to help her.  Everyone's response was I am too busy.  Or I got no response at all.  In the past, I dropped everything to help them, but they had absolutely no desire to help in return.   My heart broke for the lady in Atlanta.  I have failed at pretty much everything in my life but I was good at helping her.  Now I was in the middle of the woods, stumbling towards Katadhin for the unattainable and I couldn't even help her.   Needless to say, the tears flowed the rest of the day. Tears of every kind of pain imaginable.

It was light outside but the sun hadn't risen yet.  I stood in the rain for a few minutes and tried to enjoyed the gentleness.  
I finally ate breakfast, packed up and just started to walk.  I walked for 2 and a half hours and had only managed to go a mile and a half.  
It was still raining.  I sat down on a broken splintered tree beside the trail.  I looked up to the cloudy sky.  I watched the rain drops plummet down. Every one reminded me that I could still see, that I could still feel.  Each one was a memory I can never forget regardless of how I hard I try.  
I wanted to walk to forget.  I wanted to walk to stop reliving the past over and over again.  I wanted to walk to find my home. To find where I belonged.  I wanted to walk to stop the uncontrollable hurt.  
I have always been in complete control over my physical pain. I used that pain as a way to know I was alive. As a way to dampen my emotions. As a way to know that I am just not a shell filled with emptiness.  
In moment, resting on that splintered broken tree I realized beyond a shadow of a doubt that my splintered broken soul won't ever be whole even if I walk 10,000 miles.  Not being able to walk through the physical pain made me realize how weak I am.  
In the 1100 miles, I saw the most beautiful things.  Reflections of the world in tiny raindrops. Tiny plants emerging from the dirt and growing into the most amazing flowers.  Wildlife frolicking and foraging.   Clouds dancing in the valleys.  Rivers and streams bouncing down a mountain without a care in the world. I wanted to be a part of that.   
Maybe my answers are down another path or maybe my questions don't have answers. 
I decided then and there that Katahdin was a destination I would reach.   I was done. 
Finally I was able to will myself to walk again, all I could think about was getting back to my truck in Atlanta.  My safe spot.   
Goat caught up and I told her I was done.   We walked to the General Store at Pine Grove.  The same amazing lady from the women's group who helped in Hagerstown picked me up.  She took me to her house and I will stay there until I can get back to my truck.
