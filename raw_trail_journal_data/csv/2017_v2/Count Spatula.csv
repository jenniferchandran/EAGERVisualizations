Katahdin starting April 3, 2017. The waiting is killing me. Just got my Zpack Arc Blast and believe I am falling in love.See you on the trail.Count Spatula",,Planning the trip,"Dec 05, Mon",0
Count Spatula,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552173,"In a fairly short time, I have become a big fan of the Z Pack Arc Blast backpack. Its 52 litre size is enough for the max of 30 lbs I plan to carry and there is practically zero strain on my shoulders on a few 12 to 15 mile hikes. I retired last January, right around the time that my 28 year old son started talking about an early career break to hike the Appalachian Trail. With a little encouragement from my truly wonderful (and still working) wife to think about joining the lad on this great adventure, I was all in before she could finish her little pep talk. Now, the burden is not a heavy backpack, but the realization that I have to wait 4 more months to get this show on the road. I am geared up and ready to go but there is nothing in the immediate outlook but training through the MN winter on snowshoes.

Count Spatula,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552442,"So sad to see the devastation from the fires in Tennessee and N. Carolina. I've been hearing about the drought along the southern AT for awhile now and it is clear that the fire, even though apparently intentionally set, was almost inevitable. Not sure how visible the effects of the fire will be from the AT, but it is all a heartbreaking loss. Planning to start my NOBO thru hike on April 3 and will pray for a nice wet winter in Georgia, N. Car, and Tennessee and VA in the interim. Meanwhile, I continue to sift through the gear trying to make sure that I keep my pack weight at or below 30 lbs. It is proving to be harder than I had thought.","Amicalola Falls

Count Spatula,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553536,"Just a little over 2 months to go before my thru hike start on April 3. I have been thinking a lot about building the commitment to do this thing and trying to ready myself for the emotional and physical trials to come. That the challenges exist only in my imagination, but remain essentially unknowable as I await my very first step out of Amicalola Falls, makes achieving that commitment a slippery objective. I have done a fair amount of backpacking, but, other than a month on the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, all of it has been in the weekend or 1-2 week range. In other words, nothing in my experience prepares me for a six month odyssey into the great unknown. I liken it to the birth of my first son back in 1988. Reading and pondering parenthood during my wife's pregnancy never made the real thing any clearer. I remember so well the impossibility of seeing and really preparing for that impenetrable future. When Paul was born, it was a lot like we were all newborns, exploring a brand new world together. In my contemplation of starting out on this epic adventure, I meet again my total inability to fully grasp what I will have to face. In some sense, this is even more difficult, as I knew that I would never allow myself the option to get up some morning and walk away from parenthood. While I have no intention of quitting the trail either, knowing that I can do so without life-shattering consequences makes building that commitment to never let that happen more, not less, difficultI have been telling everyone I know that I am getting ready to hike over two thousand miles. Every time I do this, I am piling on the hope that shame and embarrassment alone will keep me going when I wake up to a driving rain for the 4th day in a row. But I am also cognizant that, ultimately, it is going to take a lot more than that to reach Katahdin. I will NEED to make the person that can do that an absolutely essential component of who I am. I need to arrive at the point where I could no more walk away from this journey, than I could walk away from being a father and a husband. Whether it is a good day or a rough and painful day becomes simply the environment I live in for that moment, but is irrelevant to the decision already firmly embedded.Getting there is the challenge two months before my first step.",,Building the commitment,"Jan 20, Fri",0
