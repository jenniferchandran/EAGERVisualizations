Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551634,"Starting to make very long lists of things to do in advance of March. I did some practice hikes in the summer including a trip to Maine Huts and a couple of nights on the Manadnock-Sunapee Greenway and then 200 miles of The Long Trail in Vermont for 3 weeks in September. I was fortunate to get the time off from work to be able to be away for that long and hiked from Williamstown to just past Camel's Hump, then skipped ahead to Smuggler's Notch resort and hiked another day and a half with my brother, ending at route 15. Will finish the remaining parts of the LT another time. 
I'm pretty confident that my gear is mostly ready. I added an inflatable pillow, a silk sleeping bag liner and an iPod Shuffle to my gear, but everything else I'm using will be what I used in Vermont. I'll list my stuff in the gear list.
I'm aiming for the 3rd week of March for a takeoff date from Springer.",,Lists,"Nov 18, Fri",0
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554197,"For my family and friends that may not have all the details....The Appalachian Trail (A.T. or The Trail) has a Southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, and a Northern terminus at Baxter Peak on Mount Katahdin, in Baxter Park, Maine. The A.T. is 2190.1 miles from end to end, this year. The total distance changes from year to year reflecting route adjustments along the way.   Hikers that complete a full end to end in one hiking season are referred to as ""Thru Hikers"".   Those that start in Georgia and travel north are North-bounders or NOBOs and those that travel south are South-bounders or SOBOs. There are almost infinite permutations of an alternative way to be a thru hiker by traveling either north or south for part of the trail from one location and then heading back to finish the other way, and that is known as flip-flopping and hikers that do that are ""flip floppers"". A few other terms that you will see used and may be helpful as you read journals:The average thru hike takes 5-7 monthsThe A.T. is in 14 statesThe elevation gain from completing the A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 timesThe dropout rate for those attempting a Thru hike is between 65 and 80 percent.Zero- a day with no actual trail miles covered; likely a day in town doing chores like resupplying, laundry and eating.Nero - a low mileage day (near zero) with more opportunity to do town activityBlaze - a 2 x 6 inch painted marker that shows where the trail is; The A.T. uses white for the trail, blue blazes are for side trails, red is the border of the trail and we shouldn't go past a red mark (danger!) A double white blaze means the trail makes a turn.Yellow blazing is a derogatory term for a hiker that skips ahead by road (yellow lines on the road)AYCE - All You Can Eat.Bear Bag - A bag used to put food, trash, dirty cook pots, lip balm and anything else that a critter would like to get. The bag his hung from a tree, provided cables or put in a large metal box provided at shelters to discourage bears from human food, since once they get a taste for human stuff, they are addicted and will become a nuisance and eventually have to be dealt with in not very nice ways.Blow down - a tree that has fallen across the trail. Volunteer trail maintainers clear these periodicallyTrail Angel - a person that helps hikers with food, rides, or shelterTrail Magic - anything that appears when you need it or food, drinks or picnics that people leave, prepare or give a hikerShelter - Usually a 3 sided shed-like structure that will allow 6-16 people to sleep off the ground on a wooded platform or bunk. In Maine these are called Lean-to's; you can stay in these for free. There is typically a water source nearby (stream, spring) and a privy which is a dug pit with a little shelter around itHuts - in New Hampshire the Huts are commercial lodging facilities that require reservations and most thru-hikers don't stay in these unless they do work for stayWork for stay - in the Huts, the staff (Croo) may allow a couple or few thru-hikers to do a few chores in exchange for the ability to stay Slack Pack - hiking with only the necessities for a day and then returning to a hostelPurist - hiker that follows every white blaze, and doesn't slack pack (Here's where you'd say ""HYOH"")Stealth - a nonofficial camp spot off the trail, just in the woods",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Sun",0

I'm within 4 weeks of departure and just under 4 weeks from my start. I have my plane ticket for 3/18, and will stay that night at The Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega, and the shuttle to Amicalola State Park the next morning. I plan on starting at the visitors center and doing the 600 odd stairs of the Approach Trail on Sunday, then spending the rest of the day and night at the Lodge and starting the Approach Trail from the Lodge Monday morning. The approach trail is about 8 miles to the official start of the A.T. On Springer Mountain and is supposedly a challenge, so I'm really starting slow as most veteran hikers recommend. I've roughly mapped out where I'll be over a few weeks and figured out what I'll mail to a few places in advance. I'll be using AWOLs guide, an app known as Guthooks (AThiker on the App store) and an electronic version of ALDHA's Thru-Hiker's Companion) for trail and town information. 
Treadmill work and strength training continues, and I'm knocking items off my to do list at home and for the adventure. I'm getting nervous and excited and time is flying by. 
I want to thank my wife for being so supportive of my dream, I am very lucky. 
Big props to a few previous hiker class members who's journals were really helpful:
Reset from 2014, 3D and Bon Bon from 2015 and Elle from 2016. And especially thanks to all the volunteer trail maintainers that make the path possible.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Tue",0

Thank you to my trainer Andy who for the last 2 years plus 3 months has endured my bad jokes and pushed me to get me in better hiking shape with squats, stair runs, planks and all kinds of other medieval ideas combined with heaps of encouragement. I shipped my gear to The Hiker Hostel last week and, of course, tracked its progress multiple times every day to make sure I knew where it was-as if I could control it. I prepared a few drop boxes for Neel Gap, Hiawassee and Fontana. My wife and I went over a thousand things related to our life and my adventure and again I repeat how grateful I am that I am able to attempt this with her support. We enjoyed a recent trip to Florida to see our oldest son, then our twin boys were home last week for a mid term break and our 2nd son was home this week and it was spectacular to see all of them. I'm looking forward to meeting my classmates from the 2017 class and will share my journey as time, signal and energy allow.

I knew I had about 90 minutes to kill as my shuttle ride was timed to include another couple of hikers. So I grabbed a late lunch at the airport and took my time getting to MARTA. I rode the subway to the North Springs station in Atlanta where I waited 'til 6:45 with two other hikers (Faye from Maine and Maggie from Pennsylvania) when Josh from The Hiker Hostel arrived to take us to Dahlonega and his place. We stopped at Subway for dinner and got to the hostel at around 7:45.I retrieved my gear boxes and got my stuff mostly organized and ready for the morning.   Went to bunk at 9:00.I slept a little, more like a series of naps until 5:20, got up, showered and played a game of chess with a guy from Thailand until 7:00 when I went back into the room to finalize my pack. Had a great breakfast, settled the bill and was in the suburban with Josh and Maura, who is also doing the approach trail, at 8:30 sharp on the way to Amicalola Falls. I went to the visitors center, signed in and weighed my pack. I am hiker number 993 and my pack weighed in at 35lbs. I went to the arch at the beginning of the Approach trail and took pictures and lollygagged for a while and then hiked about an hour up the trail and stairs to the Lodge, so a super easy day! The views from the lodge balcony are breathtaking. The Hostel was full last night and only 2 of us were doing the Approach trail.

It was a good day weather wise. Not too hot and really pleasant. I left the lodge at first light so I could enjoy the crisp early morning. It took me until noon to finish the approach trail. I signed the register in the rock and got pictures. I then switched to white blazes and hiked with a recent high school grad for a while and ultimately went to Hawk Mountain campsites. My mileage today doesn't reflect the remaining miles on the approach trail, so I put in about 15.2 miles. I got there around 4:30 and found a site, set up camp, cooked and was in the sleeping bag at 8:00, pretty tired.

During the morning I sent a note to The Hiker Hostel to see if they had any open bunks, as thunderstorms were forecast for the night. At the shelter I got an email that they had a bunk for me , so I set off to Woody Gap after a break for lunch and chat with JP from Asheville and Smokestack and Mother Nature-caretakers at the shelter. It was about 80 degrees and I was sucking wind on my way, hoping for a quick spritz to cool me off. At about 3:30, I ran into a rainstorm.   It started without any warning and quickly turned into a deluge with BB sized and then marble sized hail. I got to the gap that was trail magic there with the 12 tribes and a pop-up shelter to hang out out of the rain and then at 5 o'clock Leigh from The Hiker Hostel showed up and took us to the Hostel. Did my laundry took a shower, made dinner and had a good nights rest. The thunderstorm was a complete raging, sideways rain with lots of lightning and thunder.

I got my fleece, rain coat and rain pants out of my pack and on and was much better starting out. After about a half hour out of the gap and moving uphill, I needed to get the layers back off. 
Blood mountain lived up to its reputation with a long climb up to 4400 feet and then a steepish descent into Neels Gap. I picked up my drop box from Mountain Crossings and went to Blood Mountain Cabins with 3 other hikers, Canada, Bubba and Bobo. 
We all got pizza from the general store and had a good chat for a few hours before bed. Good Times.

Got to Low Gap and it was really crowded.   I decided to skip forward to find a better spot and grabbed water and started back up the trail at around 4:00. I got to Poplar Stamp Gap at about 5:15.

The trail was really pleasantly smooth and mostly flat for a few miles, soft and dry. Then came Blue mountain which was surprisingly difficult and then about 1100 feet down into Unicoi Gap, where there were a few guys doing trail magic - cooking hot dogs, coolers of Gatorade and beer. I had two hot dogs and a Gatorade, sat for a little while to rest and then moved on. Thanks guys for that wonderful lunch which came right before Rocky Mountain which was back up to 4193 feet from 2949 at the Gap. 2.3 miles past the summit is The Cheese Factory site; an old dairy farm site, which had a bunch of tent spots.

The weather for the next 2 days was for Thunderstorms, so I planned to get to The Top of Georgia Hostel on Sunday and do a NERO. So today's goal was Deep Gap shelter at mile 56.3, 9.4 miles away. Starting out was Tray Mountain at 4430, up from 3579, then bouncing down and up around 3500 and finally up from 3300 to Kelly Knob at 4126, which was tough. I was first at the shelter and grabbed a top level spot. The shelter filled up by 5:00. It was a good group and everyone settled in and to sleep by 9:00. The storm hit at around midnight.

I was there by 11:00. I was given a set of scrubs, a towel and a laundry basket. I got my laundry together and got a shower in time to make the first shuttle to town. I ate lunch at a Mexican dinner lace with Rolling Stone, T Squared and Honey Bee then went to Ingles and bought a few things including salad for dinner.

It was a cool foggy morning and I hiked along listening to bird song and enjoying the forest. I went along to the NC border and then NC welcomes you with an amazingly steep 1000 feet incline in less than a mile. I slugged my way up and eventually came to Muskrat Creek shelter which again was packed. I'm clearly in the bubble. A little bit further on is White Oak Stamp camping area. I found a perfect place, got my chores done (set up tent, get water, cook, hang bear bag) and was on the rack by 7:45. Thunderstorms raged between 10 and 2 and it was wild.

It was cloudy and so no views until after 12:30 when things started to burn off. It was a very pleasant hike. As I rounded a corner I ran into Prism and her dog Scout. I hike for a few days last year with Prism on The long trail. What a surprise! When we got to Carter Gap Shelter, which is where I thought I'd call home, it again was packed. Soooo, on I went to Betty Creek Gap, which was another 3 plus miles but over relatively tame terrain. I got there and found a nice spot under some Rhododendron trees (unlike what we have in New England as shrubs-these babies are like something from Jurassic Park). There was a great water source just down a side trail, so all was well. I cooked and made my plan for tomorrow. Things dried out so I was quite happy.","White Oak Stamp

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558840,"Today, I passed 100 miles on the A.T. (this trip-last year on the Long Trail, I actually did slightly more than 100 A.T. miles). From Betty Creek Gap, it was a short hike and a rock scramble to the top of Albert Mountain and the tower there. The weather was perfect-clear, mid 50's and not too windy, and the views made the climb worth it. I spent about a half hour there and made reservations at a Hostel in Franklin for the evening, so off to Winding Stair Gap.   I was at Rock Gap by 12:30, and then Winding Stair Gap at 2:15. 3 other hikers-Man Eater, Littlefoot and Lucky hitched a ride and there was room in the truck for me, so down to Franklin we all went. Our Angel dropped us off at their hotel and then my Hostel- what a nice guy-Thanks Greg. I got my bunk, gave my laundry up and sorted through two boxes I'd shipped ahead, and my pack and got a package ready to send home. I showered and then headed to find the PO but found a commercial place called Going Postal (nice!) before I got to the PO, so they won. I yogied a ride from a local woman in the store up to Outdoor 76, to buy a fuel canister and resisted the sales effort of the guy selling shoes that would get me to Maine. I went up the block to The Lazy Hiker Brewery, had a beer and some food from the truck next door and played some trivia with a few other hikers until 7:30, when I walked back to the Hostel for the night.","Betty Creek Gap

Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558962,"I slept ok in the Hostel, but it was a late crowd. There was an announcement at 6:45 AM that there was a free pancake and bacon breakfast by a local church, so most of the people took off for that. I decided to skip it, in favor of organizing my stuff and checking in at home as my Mom was hospitalized last night. At 9:00, the Transit bus came by, so I got on. It drove around Franklin and eventually to Winding Stair Gap at about 10:00.   The first objective was Siler's Bald. I made that around 12:30. The trail goes by at the bottom of it, and a side trail takes you up to the top. I skipped the side trail as I figured it would take an hour up and down. Next was Wayah Gap-anytime you see Gap, it means down and then UP-and eventually Wayah Tower. The area was severely damaged by last year's forest fires, everything that was wood on Wayah tower was gone, the tower is stone. It was really windy but once again, the climb rewarded me with spectacular views. I went down towards the Wayah shelter which is about .8 miles. I got there and the shelter was full, most of the tent sites were gone as there was a Boy Scout troop from Alabama there. I moved about 100 feet north on the trail and found a nice flat site and claimed that. Of course a big Thunderstorm was forecast for overnight, which did happen. I'm getting used to this. My sleeping bag got a little wet in this storm, but nothing serious. I had cell service until I made camp and then nothing, so no news from home on Mom.","Winding Stair Gap

I thought I'd make coffee sitting in the tent with my JetBoil between my legs in the vestibule so I could stay mostly dry. I had water in it and thought, ""this is a really bad idea"", and leaned forward to open the vestibule flap, and of course spilled the water into my lap, and tent, thankfully it wasn't hot! Cleaned that up, and got going without my coffee.   It was muddy and wet, so slow walking. I got into a groove and was hypnotized by the thick of the forest without a road for a while. Climbed up to Wesser tower, again, earning amazing views, and then settled for the night at Wesser Shelter. I got my gear mostly dried out before sundown and shared the shelter with Shaggy and Due Date. Today, I noticed my right ankle was swollen.

I took my time knowing that it was a short day. Ankle hurting, but tolerable. It was a nice walk. I arrived at around 11:45.   It's a cool place with lots of outdoor activity- zip lines, kayaking, a restaurant!, outfitter, general store and hotel. There was trail magic, so I grabbed and chugged a Gatorade, then checked to see about room check in, not yet, and then went to the restaurant and ate a big green salad and a cheese burger and tater tots-awesome! Went to the outfitter to grab a dehydrated dinner for the trail as my supplies were lacking and then got checked in at the room. I did a load of laundry and got all my gear out of my pack and wiped all the dirt off everything and of course showered. I walked back down and soaked my ankle in the cool river water and that helped some. I got news on my mom-still in hospital and not resolved. I had a long conversation with my wife and went to sleep about 10. My plan was to leave at first light as the climb out of the N.O.C. is brutal, and since I'm slow, I wanted to maximize my time.   I'm looking at where there are road crossings in case I have to bail out and trying not to be too deep without access to an airport.","Wesser Shelter

I got my pack ready, ate some breakfast and hit the trail at 7:30, just at sunrise.   Today was all about up and down. It was forecast to be clear but hot and they were right, eventually the temperature got to 85 F. I worked my way up to Cheoah Bald, and that took until 12:30.   It was so hot that it took all I had just to stay on the beat. The views were good. I ran into Man Eater up there who was taking a break. Zeus and Sassafrass also came up shortly after me. Next stop was down to Stecoah Gap. I planned to stop and cook dinner there, and let the temps cool down before continuing, but when I got there, a couple who had driven 2 1/2 hours from Tennessee were there doing trail magic. They had been there all day cooking hot dogs and making barbecue sandwiches, which were all gone, but they had ice cold sodas, Oreos, other snacks, fruit and water. I got some fast energy and filled my water bottles, had a pack-off rest and skipped cooking. Thank you to these Trail Angels. Also from this spot, I could see the Smokies in Great Smoky National Park. I crossed the road and started back up hill knowing that Jacob's Ladder was just ahead. Holy Moly.   It was a butt kicker. I resorted to 10 steps, 5 breathes, repeat for about an hour to finally get over the multiple knobs that the trail went over. I got to the next shelter at just after 6:00 and there were no good camp sites, so I left and decided I'd find a stealth spot. Eventually, I decided on Cody Gap to camp. I got there at 7:45.   I had enough light to get my tent up and cook. I ate by a campfire that others had made, hung my bear bag in the dark and got to bed after 9. This was a big day for me.

My tent held up fine, and around 6:15 I started getting my stuff packed up.   I made cold coffee and ate breakfast and was getting my pack cover on at 7:45 when it started sprinkling. I got going and hiked through rain showers until around 10:30 when it rained really hard and steady until noon. It was muddy, so I slowed down to avoid falling, but I was slipping all over the place. I got to Fontana Road crossing at around 12:15 and still had 1.8 miles to get to the dam. I crossed the road and the parking lot and went back into the woods and the storm actually got worse, lightning, really hard rain and wind.   I hiked through that for an hour to the visitors center at the dam. I was pretty cold, and I was basically soaked from head to toe. The folks at the visitors center tried to call for a shuttle to the Village where I had a reservation, but apparently something got hit by lightning and the phones didn't work.   I was outside trying to call, when Ed, an injured hiker from Louisiana who was making his rounds picking up his drop boxes on his way home, offered to drive me. He gave me a towel to sit on and we made it to the village where I got checked in to my room.   Thank you Ed. I made the decision then to book two nights to let my ankle rest. I got in the room, exploded my pack, laid stuff out and hung stuff up to dry, got a shower, went back to get my drop box and dumped that out, got some hot coffee and checked in on my mom. Things had gotten bad; she needed and was being prepped for emergency surgery for a perforated ulcer. Scary at any age, and very risky at 94.   Initially I said, I'd wait for the outcome of the surgery and 5 minutes later had decided I was done. I needed to come home, no question.   I talked to the desk about which airport to use, then called American to see what flights they had, and when, from Knoxville and Asheville, then called a shuttle driver to see if I could make it, then booked a flight out of Knoxville. I asked a hiker in the lobby if he could use a gas canister and he said sure, and then he came to my room and I gave him all of my supplies, from my drop box-snacks, meals, bars, and the gas. I got my stuff packed back up and went to check out. They didn't charge me. Unbelievable.    The shuttle driver showed up at 5:45 and off we went to Knoxville. He asked if I got car sick as we were going to drive The Tail of the Dragon. About 30 minutes into the drive up the road with no cell service, there was a large tractor-trailer moving van jackknifed across the road. No way around it. Butt head. That meant that it would be 2 1/2 Hours through the the Smokies to Knoxville, i.e. Missed flight.   About face, back to Fontana, towards the decision point and back into cell coverage. I called American and rebooked from Asheville, which was delayed and had the same connecting flight from Charlotte to Boston. We stopped at Walmart so I could buy a jumbo suitcase to stuff my gear in for the airplanes. That worked out well.   I made it to the ticket counter and the gate in plenty of time to make the flight. There was only 1 other passenger on the plane. We left at 9:55 PM and were in the terminal at CLT at 10:35. I ran to try to make the 10:45 connection, but it was in another terminal and I just missed it. Thanks moving van dude. I wonder how many other people's lives were affected by the selfish move that resulted in a completely blocked road? The rebooked flight was at 7:50 AM Tuesday.

She was in the hospital for 5 weeks, suffered a series of setbacks including an abdominal access and fluid in one of her lungs; she was mentally strong but physically, her 94 year old body wouldn't  let her continue.  Ultimately she made the decision to stop treatment and move to comfort measures only.   She passed away peacefully on May 4th.  All of us kids were there with her.  She gave me an incredible gift during her last days, telling me that she was at peace, not afraid and ready.   I am so lucky to have had the chance to be with her for those days and the preceding weeks.    I was so consumed during April and then early May that I didn't really think about resuming hiking too much.  Then we had my son's graduation from college.  Now I'm in regroup-mode and thinking about 2018 and restarting at Springer next March.  I hope to do a few short overnights this summer- a couple nights in the Whites near Gorham and I still have 80-ish miles left on the Long Trail that my 20 year old twins want to join me for.   I hope everyone out  on the trail is having a good time and staying safe, dry and warm.",,Gym,"May 30, Tue",0
Detail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575736,"Between July 18 and 28, my 20 year old twins and I hiked the last 80 miles I needed to complete The Long Trail.  We started at Route 2/89 and went up over Bolton Mountain, Mt Mansfield and Madonna Peak, then spent 2 nights at Smuggler’s Notch.  We then shuttled to Route 15 where I ended my hike last September  and hiked to the Canadian border.  We generally had good weather except one day when it was 50 degrees and rainy and we were cold and soaked, so we called the Phinneas -Swann B & B and went to get warm and dry.  At Journeys’ end, we got shuttled back to Smuggler’s Notch resort to meet my wife and other son for a few days.    A great couple of weeks together in the woods and mountains.   The Needles Eye on Mansfield was particularly memorable for it’s challenge.  I have now walked the entire Long Trail !

Last week, my 22 year old and I hiked 22 miles in The Whites; In Gorham, the Carter-Moriah Trail to Mount Moriah, then to the AT south to the Imp Campsite.  The next day we went over the Carters and Mount Hight to the AMC hut at Carter Notch and then the following day we went up Wildcat and then down the other side into Pinkham Notch.  The trail is no joke, very steep, thankfully it was mostly dry; I wouldn’t want to go either direction in the rain.  It was a good confidence builder for me, even though my legs were quite sore for a few days afterwards.  Amazingly we ran into 2 guys I stayed with at Blood Mountain cabins in March...Bobo and Bubba, coming down Wildcat; timing is everything.5 months and 1800 miles apart and we bump into each other on the trail....them almost nearing the end of their journey and me just staying active but having gone through the roller coaster of my mom's illness and death.  It was good to see them and I wish them luck for the rest of the hike.",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Mon",0
