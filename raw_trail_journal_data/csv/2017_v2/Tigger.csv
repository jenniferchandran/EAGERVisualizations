Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556386,"After several months of planning and preparation, I'm getting ready to start one of the greatest journey's of my life.....hiking the Appalachian trail. I start on Friday, March 17 going northbound (NOBO) from Springer Mountain Georgia. I have a lot of emotions stirring as I write this entry today because it's no longer a wish or a dream...it's for REAL! I want to invite everyone to join me on my journey through this trailjournals page.My goal is to ""pay it forward"" in my writing to all the wonderful folks who hiked the trail before me. 2016 thru hikers like Storm, Bunkie, Subman and Subs, Cheryl and Santa, Two Peas, Hazel, Terodactyle, Full Throttle and more. I followed each of their journey's on trailjournals last year and felt like I became part of their trail family. I want to paint the same picture for each of you and give real insights into what it's like on the Appalachian Trail. I hope you follow along over the next 5 months.I look forward to the journey ahead and will be adding a couple entry's before my start date to give more details on my background, gear, preparation, etc. In the meantime, please feel free to interact with me by signing the guest book on the left side. Your comments, feedback and encouragement will mean so much to me and I will do my best to write you back.Until next time.....Keith",,Katahdin Maine,"Mar 14, Tue",0
Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556439,"I'm only 2 days away now from starting my AT adventure at Springer Mountain, Ga. I can't wait! I thought it would be a good time to talk about my planning and preparation for the trip as well.First and foremost, I could not start this great adventure without the love and support of my wife Cindy (pic). I've been lucky enough to be married to this wonderful women for 34 years. Believe me guys, I really married up! We have three grown children who are also cheering me on. Cindy will start the hike with me to Neel Gap and will join me every month or so for a few days. She will also be my support crew back home with food prep and resupply boxes. I couldn't do it without her!I also want to thank all my hiking friends from Dayton Hikers and the Miami Rivers Chapter of the Buckeye Trail Association. They have been so supportive and encouraging which has meant the world to me. We have spent many days and hours on the trail including several AT section hikes over the past couple of years. We're really blessed to have such a great hiking/backpacking community in Southwest Ohio. Again, I welcome everyone reading this journal to become part of my extended trail family. I want you to feel that my success on the trail will be your success too. I will need all of your love and support for sure! Please keep in touch with me often by adding a note in the guestbook on the left. In return, I'll do my best to bring the Appalachian Trail to life for each of you in my daily journals.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556602,"The time is finally here....we're on our way to Springer Mountain, Ga. today. We're leaving Cincinnati around 6:00 AM and traveling directly to Amicalola Falls to register at the Visitor Center. My wife Cindy is joining me for the first 3 days from Springer to Neel Gap. I'm sure it will be tough to part ways come Monday morning.We made arrangements to stay in Dahlonega tonight which is only 30 minutes from Amicalola and Neel Gap. We're going to park our car at Neel Gap and have a shuttle driver take us back to the Springer Mountain trailhead to start. That way we're hiking back to the car instead of Cindy having to shuttle herself on Monday morning. If all goes to plan we'll be staying at Hawk Mountain campsites on Friday evening, the Hiker Hostel near Woody Gap on Saturday and Blood Mountain Cabins on Sunday evening. I know this is a ""cushy"" way to start, but I thought it would be a better experience for Cindy at the start and provides even more trail memories. After that, I will look forward to finding and developing a new trail family with folks who are just starting out like me. That will be pretty cool.Looking forward to the day ahead. Kind of like a kid at Christmas to be honest? Springer, here we come!Until next time.....The Mountains are CallingKeith","Springer Mountain Georgia

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556754,"We had a great day and great start to my Appalachian Trail Journey. First, we had to make it to the Springer Mountain trailhead which is essentially an up and back for the first official mile of the AT. We met our shuttle driver at Neel Gap around 8am after spending the night in nearby Dahlonega, Ga. We had a bit of a scare on the way over when a car pulled out right in front of us and missing us by inches. That would have been quite a start to my AT journey. We met Ms. Dixie Wisser at the Gap and she was sweet as could be. She was subbing for her husband Wes who was dealing with some health issues. The ride over to Springer trailhead was on an old gravel forest road that had what seemed like a record number of potholes and bumps. I was bouncing around in the back like a kids inflatable bouncy house. The 90 minute ride took years off my life for sure. Ms. Dixie never stopped talking the entire trip, but she was delightful. We had decided ahead of time to not kill ourselves on the first day. I hiked with Cindy the entire day and enjoyed the time immensely. We found a great spot in a beautiful pine forest for lunch which was awesome. The trail was as easy as its going to get today which made for a nice warmup. We made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter at the 8.1 mile marker and set up our tent nearby for the night. We have approximately 25 other hikers her tonight from all over. Cindy and I had dinner at the shelter with several other thru hikers. We spent a lot of time reflecting on this experience and everyone shared why they're hiking the AT. I was impressed by the honest emotion that each person shared and what brought them to the trail. We have already met some very cool people which I know will be the favorite part of my journey. Some hiker names include Growler from Plymoth, Mass. (he loves craft beer) and Rolling Stone from Florida. Most of us don't have trail names yet, but it will come soon I'm sure. It's well past hikers midnight (8pm), so I'm going to hit the hay. We have 13 miles to complete tomorrow in order to get to Woody Gap. The forecast is calling for rain overnight with possible thunderstorm in the morning. Looks like we'll be breaking down camp in the rain. Oh well. Thanks to everyone who has posted a note so far in my guestbook. It is greatly appreciated and very encouraging for sure.Until next time.....The Mountains are CallingKeith","Springer Mountain

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556831,"Another glorious day on the trail as we hiked 12.5 miles from Hawk Mountain Shelter to Woody Gap. We woke this morning to a heavy fog after some overnight rain. Thankfully the temps stayed in the mid 40's overnight which made for a very pleasant start. The initial part of today's hike was downhill with lots of rocks and mud. We had the first climbs of the trip up Sassafras Mountain and Justus Mountain. Sassafras had an elevation gain of 700 ft over 1 mile and Justus was straight up over .5 miles. It wasn't nearly as touch as the 1900 ft climb in the Smokies last month on my final shakedown hike. Thankfully the fog burned off just before noon and it turned out to be a splendid day. We stopped for lunch at Gooch Mountain Shelter where I set up my tent to dry out. Two new thru hiker friends that we met last night at Hawk Mountain Shelter rolled in just after lunch (See Pic under photos tab on left). Carla and Sprinkle are from Scranton, Pa. and appear quite delightful. Cindy and I had the distinct pleasure of giving Sprinkle her triail name last night. Trail names happen by chance on the trail when a certain event occurs or story is told. It can't be forced, but happens organically. She loved the name and from now on will be called Sprinkle on the trail. These girls are very positive and good to have around.The coolest thing today was walking into a huge trail magic gathering at Gooch Gap. For friends and family who are new to hiking, trail magic is a single person or group that comes together on the trail and provides food, drinks, snacks and moral support. It is usually done by former thru hikers or church groups. It truly is magical and so appreciated. Today's trail magic was hosted by Geek and Boudain who through hiked the AT in 1990. Since 2002 they come back every St. Patty's Day weekend to host this event. Cindy an I really enjoyed all the good eats and beverage. Awesome!More funny stories from the trail...I ran into a group of Boy Scouts who were on an overnight backpacking trip. One young man who was probably 12 was very curious about my journey. After answering the usual questions of distance, how long it takes, etc., he finally said, ""are you going to see Travis Pastrana? Do you know who he is? I said that I remember him from the X Games years ago and all his triicks on a dirt bike, but still not sure where this conversation was going. The scout then told me that this guy lives in Maine and he has broken 53 bones. In the moment, it was so funny and unexpected on the trail. The second funny story was when I ran into a 20 something guy on the trail and asked about his trail name U-Turn. It turns out that he started a thru hike last year and went the wrong way on the first mile of the trail. That would be very hard to do.Spending the night at the Hiker Hostel which is 7 miles east of Woody Gap. They offer a free pickup at the trailhead and back to the trail tomorrow along with a big hiker breakfast. You can't beat that? Total of 23 people staying here tonight. It is a 5 star hostel for sure. Hiking up Blood Mountain tomorrow and up to Neel Gap.Until next time....Keith","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556937,"Great stay last night at the Hiker Hostel near Woody Gap. It is a 5 star hostel for sure and is more like a B&B than hostel. They put on a huge hiker breakfast this morning which fueled us well for the day. They dropped us back at the Woody Gap trailhead and we were on our way.Today was Blood Mountain day and I had heard for years how hard of a climb it would be. It has a 1600 ft elevation gain over 5 miles. The initial climb is very gradual with a sharp 800 ft climb over the last mile. Quite honestly the climb was a lot easier than yesterday's climb up Sassafras Mountain. We were blessed with a magnificent sunny day and endless views. The real prize was getting to the top of Blood Mountain. You could see forever in all directions from 4457 feet in the sky. Blood Mountain Shelter is the oldest shelter on the AT with stone walls and old wooden beams in the ceiling. Pretty cool to see. The final 2.4 miles was a steep, rocky downhill. We had to climb up and down boulders and large rock steps much of the way. We made it down to Neels Gap and had a chance to go into the famous outfitter, Mountain Crossings. It's a full service outfittter with anything a hiker would ever need along with a hiker hostel. We picked up some soft drinks and snacks for the night. We're staying at Blood Mountain cabins at Neel Gap tonight. This is Cindy's last night on the trail and I wanted her to have a nice treat. The cabins are rustic, but well equipped. They even make pizzas for you and have free laundry if you want it (great for stinky hikers). Looking forward to a good nights rest and feel spoiled to spend the last 2 nights in such nice accommodations. This is only short lived since Cindy leaves in the morning. It will sad to see my honey of almost 34 years leave. We had a great time together for the first 31 miles.Until next time.....Keith","Woody Gap

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557080,"Please note: I add a few pictures each day which can be seen by hitting the photo button on the left hand side.It's a banner day on the AT because I got my trail name. I always wanted the name to come naturally from people I hiked with and today it came a fellow thru hiker (Juke Box/formerly Ginko). She suggested Tigger because I always appear to be bouncing down the trail with joy and positivity. I accepted and from now on I will be known as Tigger on the trail. Juke Box had no idea that we raised our kids on Winnie the Pooh books and videos. Love it! Everyone sing along.....bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy 1, 2, 3, the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one, I'mmmm the only one! It was also a sad day today because Cindy had to go home to Cincinnati. It was an emotional goodbye for now, but I will see her agiain in 3 weeks to celebrate our 34th anniversary. Can't wait. Good hiking day from Neels Gap to Poplar Stamp Gap. Low Gap Shelter area was full when I arrived so I move ahead 1.4 miles and got in around 6PM. Total of 12.9 miles for the day with lots of climb and steep downhills. I prefer climbing or flat (which is rare) because downhills hurt the knees and ankles. I always channel my inner Ben Kendrick when I'm climbing Hope you're doing well buddy. I had my 2nd and 3rd trail magic today from a 2016 thru hiker and a nice older gentleman from Iowa who has been doing this for 7 years. He has never hiked himself, but gets a kick out of seeing AT thru hikers. They both served cold drinks, fruit and snacks at road crossings. It was so awesome!Met a ton of thru hikers today from all over the world including married couples aqua man and sapphire from Hawaii, and Rick and Linda from Missouri. Also met a lovely couple from Australia , Kate and Hitch, Lion from Germany, Texas Ranger from Houston, Editors Choice from Florida, Ninja from Maryland, Uncle Ned, Rockstar and Energizer. Camping tonight with Tristan and Leon from Germany as well. I literally talked to someone new on the trail the entire day. I loved getting to know them and their stories. That's the best part of being out here. Until tomorrow......Keith (Tigger)","Neels Gap

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557145,"Not a good nights rest last night, but up on on the trail by 8:30. It takes at least and hour each morning to pack up your sleeping gear, tent and all other essentials. I also cook a warm breakfast of oatmeal, couscous porridge or granola. I mix in fruits and nuts for extra calories and protein. To get ahead a bit, I filter water the night before and fill my water bladder and small Gatorade bottle for an electrolyte drink. We call all of the morning and evening activities camp chores. It's an important routine to help guarantee our success and well being. It's kind of like the movie Groundhog Day every day on the trail. Hiked a total of 12 miles today with climbs at Blue Mountain and Rocky Mountain. Rocky was tough because you start a steep 1000 ft climb after just finishing a steep 1100 ft climb down Blue Mountain. The leg muscles were burning and the heart was pumping overtime. On top of that we were trying to get to camp and setup before the huge thunderstorms rolled in. We made it just In ime. I'm in my tent right now with hard rain, thunder and lighting. It's all part of the experience and something we just have to roll with. Hiking the last couple of days with Justin who is a Navy Vet and Penn State grad and works on research vessels around the world. We get along well and will both stay at the infamous Top of Georgia Hostel tomorrow night. Also camping tonight with another old timer from Australia. He's a really cool guy. Today's photos include a pic of Blue Mountain Shelter and the view at the top of Rocky Mountain. Please note that in the next couple of days I'll switch my name on the trailjournals page to Tigger.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557256,"Today's Pic: Taken at top of Kelly KnobWe survived the huge thunderstorm last night that gave us all we wanted and more. It was a great test for my gear and willpower. Both came thru with flying colors. My Zpacks Duplex tent that is only 21 ounces withstood the 40 mph winds and kept me dry. The only bummer is packing up wet gear in the morning. I was able to air out my pack and tent tonight when I got to the hostel. I'm good to go in the morning.I was really motivated today by the thought of a nice hostel and town food. I had two hard climbs up Tray Mountain and Kelly Knob. Both were over 1100 feet straight up. Once again, the steep downhills were much tougher than the climbs. Your quad muscles are in constant contraction for 1-2 miles down. Ouch! The final downhill comes into Dicks Creek Gap on US 76. It's a half mile walk up to Top of Georgia Hostel. I was blown away by the high level of customer service here. I was greeted with a cold soda and offer to do my laundry. This stinky hiker is now shower clean with fresh smelling clothes. It's a good day. They also shuttled us into Hiawassee for dinner and resupply. We ate at the popular Daniels All You Can Eat buffet where I splurged on salad and vegetables. I finished it off with a pitcher of sweet tea. The hostel is full with 30 thru hikers tonight. I continue to meet and spend time with great people from all over the world. We're all in the same boat and make very easy connections whenever we meet.

We started the day again with a climb up which is common when you leave a Gap. We were all excited today to cross into North Carolina @ mile 78.2 and officiallly be done with one state. Only 13 more to go.Since this day 7 on the trail already, we are forming bonds and little trail families now. We hike together in pairs or near each other throughout the day and usually reunite at the same Shelter or campsite each night. After doing camp chores like setting up you tent, air mattress, sleeping bag and filtering water, we meet in and around the Shelter to cook our meals and chit chat. There's a lot of story telling and laughter most nights along with reviews of the days hike. For dinner I ate a delicious chili that I dehydrated before my trip. I also dehydrated a hearty spaghetti, rice and beans and tuna mac and cheese. They taste great on the trail. Today we hiked thru the area that was devastated by forest fires last fall. These areas near the NC/GA border and where we're tenting tonight. The burnt forest (see in photos) smells like your barbecuing on the grill. Sad to see, but the forest will heal itself. These fires started before and after the Gatlinburg fires. The AT in this section was closed for quite some time. I added some additional photos today including fellow hikers on the trai. These include the couple Lawn Dart and Waffler, Eli (hiking the trail alone in her Gap year between high school and college), Slipnslide from Orlando, Justin from San Francisco and others . Spent the day hiking with 2EZ from Agustin, Ga. He's retired from the navy and has a spouse who is still active duty. Good guy and a very strong hiker.

We were all so excited to get to Franklin, NC for a much needed rest. The 7 miles flew by and we were at the Gap by 9:20 to pick up the shuttle into town. We're staying at the Baltimore Jack Hostel which is setup nicely for AT Thru hikers. Baltimore jack is a famous Thru hiker and trail angel who just passed away last year We have 4 bunks in our room and share a bathroom. Showers and laundry were the first orders of business before lunch. Franklin is a GREAT little Mountain town and prides itself in being one of the top AT trail towns in America. I would agree. It has a lovely Main Street with quaint shops, restaurants, bakery, candy store and a terrific Outfitter. The culture is warm and friendly with southern charm.We all met st the Lazy Hiker (great name) brewery that had a terrific food truck onsite. The burger I ordered was bigger than my head and tasted great. Hikers come to town hungry and we crave real food and beverage. We hit the jackpot at this place. I included pics of our group that included Justin, Elly, Hobo Joe and wife Kim, Dance The Hiker (like Chance the Rapper), Frog and our new friend from the UK. What a great group of people who I would never had met if it wasn't for the AT. The ease of connection and fellowship is like none other. We plan on taking a ZERO day tomorrow to rest our bodies and refuel with more good food. A ZERO is when we hike no miles on that day. This was my 9th consecutive day on the trail and now it's time for some R&R.

By chance we ran into Seven (trail name) who has become famous on the AT for his hiker trash videos. He is quite a character for sure. We had also run into Ms. Janet and Forest in Franklin this weekend as well... all very well known in the AT community and culture. Our day started with a long uphill hike up to Siler Bald. A Bald is an open, grassy area on a mountain with very few trees. Some bales are natural and others are man made for farming or other agriculture. The sky's opened up for awhile and we hiked in the rain and mud. Thankfully it was a warm day. I still put on a rain jacket and waterproof pack cover to protect my gear and electronics. The rain stopped as we got to Wayah Bald at 5342 ft. This area was also hard hit by fires last fall. The top of the lookout tower was destroyed (click on photos to the left). With this elevation it feels like your on top of the world looking down. The views are endless. We ate lunch on Wayah Bald before moving on another 6 miles to end our day. Our trail family is tenting/hammocking near the Cold Spring Shelter. Our campsite is on the edge of a mountain top @5000ft. I have amazing views tonight right from my tent and the sunrise should be spectacular in the morning.Heading down the mountain tomorrow to the world famous Nantahala Outdoor Center on the AT. Looking forward to seeing this place in person.Gear Update: I decided to change out of my hiking boots and bought a pair of Brooks Cascadia 12 trail runners. They are light weight, well cushioned and have a rock plate to protect your feet from roots and rocks. This is a big change for me, but a trend for a large percentage of Thru hikers in recent years.

We were all looking forward to getting to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, but we're also dreading the 7 mile severe downhill climb. The big rains on top the mountain turned the trail into a stream (photo). Water runs downhill and often the easiest path is the well trenched AT. After 3.5 miles we came to Telico Gap and our first break of the day. We drink and snack up for no more than 10 minutes and get back on the trail. This may also be time for potty stop which consists of a trip further into the woods. We made it up to Wesser Bald and climbed the observation tower at over 4627 ft. We had the best.views of the trip so far with 360 panoramic views. Incredible beauty! From Wesser Bald we climbed down to The Jumpoff where we had to scramble down and around huge rocks over a mountain ledge (photo). Our final 4 miles was a steep downhill into the Nantahala Outdoor Center. These severe downhills are by far the hardest on my feet, ankles and knees , but also a necessary evil. The NOC was a welcome site and we decided to stay in the bunkhouse for the night. This is the Olympic training center for white water kayak events. They have sent several of their own to the Olympics, including 2 gold medals (see photo of whitewater slalom). It's a beautiful evening in the mountains with highs of 74 for tomorrow.

Our first 7 miles was uphill for a total of 3300 vertical ft. The trail at times had a 25-30% grade...very steep. We peaked at Cheoah Bald near 5062 ft. By now it was lunchtime and we were all ready for a break. We had 9 miles left to camp and knew we had to hit it hard to make it before dark. We had a series of ups and downs to Stecoah Gap before our last big climb of the day. 'This climb is called Jacobs Ladder and one of the steepest to date. We all made it and only had a short downhill to camp. We were surprised to find this remote site so full and had to set up tents on a slight slant.

It was a rough nights rest due to no flat tent spots along with other Thru hikers coming in loudly well past hikers midnight. Nice people, but they just forgot the unwritten rules on the trail. This was the easiest hiking day since our first day on the trail. It was mostly a gentle downhill with less rocks and roots on the trail. We were flying at over 3 mph which is unusually fast on the AT...especially with a 28# pack on my back. Even though I started with a pretty good base of fitness, I can tell that my trail legs are getting stronger by the day.We hit the Fontana Dam Shelter before getting to the Dam. This Shelter is also called Fontana Hilton because it has a glorious view of the lake along with showers and a recharge station for your electronics. We decided to push on to the Dam and get a shuttle to the Lodge for the night. I really need a good nights rest before hitting the Smokies in the morning. The lodge has a full service restaurant which we'll enjoy as well. Since we have a little trail family going, we agreed to split the room cost which makes it very cost effective. Getting a hot shower was worth it all. I don't smell myself tonight which is a good thing. We're off to the Smokies in the morning. It's 71 miles in length and we hope to complete it in 5 days.

AT thru hikers must have permits to enter which we printed off in Franklin. The cost is $20.00 which seems fair to me. We tear off the lower half and place it into a box at the start of the trail. We put the other half into a box at the end of the trail. The Appalachian Trail travels 71 miles thru the Smokies. My goal is to get this section done in 4.5 days. There is endless beauty to behold, but the weather is fickle and unpredictable. For those of you who have hiked or visited here I'm sure you'll agree.

I'm currently off trail as of Saturday, April 1 due to a chronic medical condition. A few friends and family know that I was diagnosed with a form of rheumatoid arthritis 12 years ago. It's an auto-immune disease process that flares up without warning. In my case, it has only attacked my knees and ankles. The most frustrating thing for RA patients like me is that we're otherwise very healthy and well conditioned outside of these flare ups. My preparation over the past 9 months included several section hikes on the AT, a section hike on the PCT, a lot of leg work in the gym, core work, yoga and stretching. I've done everything in my power to be physically ready for this thru hike. This makes my current circumstance very frustrating to say the least. I was cruising along at nearly 15 miles per day with no problems at all. Then came Saturday morning... I woke up early in Russell Fields Shelter and quickly noticed my severely swollen and immobile right knee. I knew right away what was going on from previous flare ups. I couldn't put weight on the leg and knew that I had to get off the mountain ASAP for treatment. I spoke to Elly and Justin (trail family) about the situation and they quickly figured out a plan. We had 2 options to reach a road access point. The first was to hike 19 miles to Clingmon's Dome which would be impossible. The other option was a 5.1 mile side trail right next to the Shelter. It was straight down hill, but would lead us directly to help at the Cade's Cove Ranger Station. I called my wife to let her know what was going on and asked her to call my cousin Gail in nearby Greenville, TN. He was going to meet us at Cade's Cove and take me back to his house for the night. Cindy and my son Dan would drive down on Sunday to pick me up. I was so thankful to have a plan in place, but now I had to figure out how to hike down the mountainside. Then my ""tramily"" trail angels came to the rescue.Elly and Justin volunteered to help me down the trail. My right leg was pretty useless so they positioned themselves right in front and behind me. The downhill terrain was steep and rocky which made this the toughest 5.1 miles of my life. Thankfully we made it down without incident and were able to meet Gail and his friend Fred at the Ranger Station. They too are such wonderful trail angels and provided great conversation and entertainment for all. I was so happy to get off that mountain and get some help. On the way back to Gail's house we stopped in Gatlinburg for lunch and a resupply at the NOC Outfitter for Justin. We arranged a shuttle to get Elly and Justin back to the trail. They were selfless in their support and concern for me. I will never forget this. We hugged it out and said our goodbyes with hopes of meeting up the trail. I'll miss my trail family a lot and thank the good Lord for sending them my way. I'm heading back to Cincinnati to see my Rheumatologist and get treatment underway. The best case scenerio is to be back on the AT in month.","Russell Field Shelter

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558731,"Made it back to Cincinnati last night thanks to my wife Cindy and son Dan. My cousins Karen and Gail down in in Greenville, TN were the ultimate trail angels in providing great meals, a warm bed, shower and laundry. I love you guys!I got in to see my Rheumatologist at 7:30 this morning. He got out the big needle and drained my knee joint followed by a steroid injection. I know it sounds bad, but it really gave me some relief. I'll also be giving myself 2 injections per week to help block the RA and further reduce the swelling in my right knee. We're hitting this flare up hard from all angles and hope to be back on the trail in a month. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. In the meantime, many of you have asked about my gear choices, what is working, what's not working and so on. I'll add updates this week to cover some of those items. Keep the questions and comments coming. I'm down for a bit, but certainly not out.TTFNTigger","Greenville, TN

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558963,"Thanks to everyone for your well wishes and concern. I really appreciate my extended trail family following along on my journey! You guys are awesome!Just a quick health update before getting into gear talk. The RA meds are kicking in and I am experiencing less swelling and pain in the right knee. I'm still on crutches and not weight bearing on the right leg. It's just a waiting game at this point, but I'm lucky to have a wonderful wife who is also a Physical Therapist. She is making sure that I stay compliant with my treatment program. Several folks have had questions about my gear and how it's working out for me on the trail. Today I would like to focus on the Big 4...that is my backpack, tent, sleeping bag and air mattress. My number one objective with the Big 4 was to get the weight down as low as possible while maintaining a good comfort level. The lighter my load, the easier it is to climb mountains and decrease fatigue. Ideally the weight for these 4 items should be less than 10 lbs. My previous tent and backpack were just too heavy (3.1 lbs and 4.5 lbs) so I had to make a change before hitting the trail. My Big 4 weight is now only 6.4 oz. Tent: ZPacks Duplex, 24 oz. with stakes. This has been the best and most important purchase overall. It's a non-freestanding tent that requires you to use 2 trekking poles for center support. You have 8 stakes to make the tent tight and secure. This tent is almost bulletproof and has withstood two major thunderstorms with no leaks. The Cuben fiber material is waterproof and wind resistant. It's a single wall tent so condensation can develop when it rains or on cold nights if all 4 doors are closed. I keep at least one door open to avoid this. It won't be an issue at all when overnight temps increase to 40's and above. This is a GREAT tent!Backpack: Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60L; 32.7 oz. Another cottage industry product like ZPacks with quite a following now. It's ideal for ultralight/light backpackers up to 30 lbs of gear. It has a great fit and rides well on your shoulders and frame. The hip belt is well padded for comfort and hip pockets are extra large for storing snacks and a phone. The only negative is that the Over the Top (OTT) loading style of bag is a little tight which makes it a little harder to pack and unpack. What I love is the the large side pocket that fits my tent perfectly (never have to put a wet tent inside my pack) and the rear mesh panel that provides quick and easy access on the outside to items I need quickly on the trail (water filter, rain gear, etc.). Sleeping Bag: Western Mountaineering, Goose Down Ultralight; 29 oz. Great bag and a great long term investment for cold weather backpacking. Probably one of the highest quality bags made today. The biggest benefit is that it zips out to a full comforter as the weather gets warmer. I may decide to go to a summer bag as temps get too warm at night. Air Mattress: Exped Synmat Ultraligt; 16 oz. Yes, it's a bit heavier than some, but comfort is key on the trail. I switched from the UL NeoAir which was noisy and uncomfortable. This may be the one product that I switch out in the near future. I just haven't found the perfect sleeping surface for me yet. It's like buying shoes...one size and style does not fit all. Stay tuned!Overall I'm extremely happy with my Big 4! Please note that this was a work in progress over a couple of years and was tweaked several times after section hikes and weekend trips. My best recommendation to anyone who is considering backpacking/thru hikes is to find equipment that fits you best. It's like getting fitted for a new set of golf clubs or a new suit. It has to match your needs and fit. Let me know if you have any questions or comments. I'm happy to help you in any way. Tomorrow I'll focus on trail shoes and clothing. TTFN","Cincinnati

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559268,"My knee swelling and pain is greatly reduced and I will start some gradual weight bearing on the right leg today. It's just a waiting game with the RA flare-up, but I'm very anxious to get back to the trail. I got a nice text message from my trail family (Elly and Justin) who made it to Hot Springs on Friday. I appreciate the pic that included a Tigger stuffed animal. How cool is that? Tigger is still on the trail in spirit...As promised, I wanted to continue the gear talk discussion with a focus on shoes. Many hours of research and field trials went into these decisions and its truly a work in progress as we change and adapt along the trial. High tech fabrics and shoe technology have given us a big boost in recent years.Trail Shoes: I made the switch from a more conventional Gortex/Leather hiking boot (Vasque St. Elias) after my first 110 miles on the trail. I had used similar boots for 30 years, but now realize that old traditions don't guarantee success (or comfort) on thru hikes. If I can make the change to trail shoes, anyone can. The other important component is to get fitted by a true hiking shoe EXPERT. Taking care of your feet and buying the right trail shoe is the MOST important decision you'll make as a backpacker. I went to Outdoor 76 Outfitter in Franklin, NC for a foot/shoe evaluation. They spent 2 hours with me to insure proper foot measurement, fit, comfort, stability and grip. I tried several brands and discovered that the Brooks Cascadia 12 was best for me. It was light, well cushioned and very stable. The built in rock plate gives me good protection on the bottom of my foot. The tread provides a great grip in all trail conditions. I have hiked 70 miles in these shoes so far and am very happy with the purchase. I've read a couple hiking experts who believe that by reducing the weight of your shoes by one pound, allows you to effectively lessen the impact of your backpack weight by four pounds. This is huge on the trail and I'm already a believer. Trail shoes allow you to be lighter of foot, with less foot pain and faster recovery. Another benefit is less blisters. I no longer get blisters on my 2nd toe and inside big toes. Finally, I went with a non-Gortex shoe. Sure, I'll get some moisture when it rains, but I won't have all the perspiration on warmer days that Gortex causes. Gortex has a tendency to hold this moisture against your feet and not allow them to breathe. I've had issues with this for many years and now it's no longer a problem. Like everything else, foot care and shoe selection is a very personal thing. One size and one shoe does not fit all. I would just encourage you to go through a professional fitting with someone who has actual long-term experience in hiking/backpacking. Try to avoid the typical retail outlets (inlcuding REI) and find a local outfitter with the experience you're looking for. Make sure they measure the length and WIDTH of your foot. You will probably discover like me that you've been wearing the wrong size hiking shoe/boot for a long time. During long distance hikes, your feet will grow. Expect to buy a shoe at least 1/2 to 1 size larger. You won't regret it. Let me now if you have any questions or other comments by signing the guest book to the left. I'll focus on clothing in my my next journal. Thanks again for following along with me on this journey.TTFN","Springer Mountain Georgia

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559680,"I've been off the trail now for 9 days and can't wait to get back out there. The swelling and pain in my right knee is gone and I'm close to my return. I just have to figure out the logistics in getting the RA medications out to the trail moving forward. I require two injections per week and the Enbrel has to be refrigerated. I will not let this minor issue hold me back!Even though I miss the trail, it was nice to be home and celebrate my 34th wedding anniversary with Cindy. We had a great brunch at the Cozy Cottage on Sunday which was so enjoyable. I truly married up big time and for some reason she has stayed so young while I have gotten old. I'm a lucky man! We also had the chance to enjoy dinner with our Cincinnati/Dayton hiking friends and had a great cookout/dinner with our son, daughter and daughter-in-law. They have all been following my journey closely on trailjournals and have been so supportive and encouraging. In a way, I feel like I'm on this journey not only for myself, but for many friends, family and total strangers who have been following along. I love this relationship that we have through trailjournals and take the responsibility very seriously. As I described in my early journal entries, I want to bring the trail to life for people. Sometimes that means I need to share the raw emotions of it all. The journey has been like nothing I've ever experienced before because the Appalachian Trail has its own unique culture. It's far removed from what we experience in everyday life, work and family dynamics. There is a common bond of support, love and understanding that doesn't exit in normal life. There are no titles, no hoops to jump through, no corporate BS, no judgement...we are all the equals on the trail. How refreshing is that?Thanks again for all the love and support! I'll get to my gear review tomorrow with a focus on clothing. Have a great folks! You are the best!TTFN","Springer Mountain Georgia

Love it!As promised, I wanted to finish my gear review with a focus on clothing choices. I admit that these decisions were a bit easier as compared to backpack, tent, etc. because I had more real life/trail experience wearing these products over the past couple of years. My choices had to meet the following criteria....lightweight, breathable, moisture wicking and odor control. The days of polyester are out and Merino wool is in!Shirts: Icebreaker brand Merino wool> Super lightweight, breathable, moisture wicking and naturally odor reducing. You can wash them on the trail and they dry within a couple hours. They don't hold the odor like polyester/nylon!Pants: Kuhl brand Renegade Convertible (can zip off to shorts)> Kuhl has become a favorite brand of mine over the past 3 years. It's made of a lightweight, moisture wicking, stretchy material that flexes with you on the trail. Multiple pockets for storage and easily converts to shorts on warm days. Underwear: Exofficio has been the best brand for serious hikers the past few years. Lightweight, moisture wicking, odor control material that dries extremely fast. You can wash these on the trail and they'll be dry within a couple of hours. I rotate these in camp with the Tommy John sports brief which is also moisture wicking with odor control. These have the best comfort level while hiking due to it's unique U-shape....no ride up boys!Sleep Wear: Patagonia Capilene mid weight thermals bottoms/tops. Top is 1/4 zip and can be worn around camp at night over merino wool shirt.Base Layer: Patagonia R1 Pullover Hoody> Polartec® Power Grid™ fabric with Polygiene® permanent odor control is light and breathable with outstanding stretch and durability. This is my FAVORITE and MOST VERSATILE clothing item. I wear this 75% of the time over my Icebreaker shirt and nothing else. You can zip it all the way down or up on the fly while you hike based upon temps. It's a must have product for any serious hiker!Socks: Darn Tough socks> Merino wool, moisture wicking with a lifetime guarantee. These are the most popular socks on the trail.Puffy Coat: Patagonia Down Hoody Sweater Jacket> lightweight, very warm and comfortable. I wear this around camp at night and early mornings before hiking. It's a must have for March/April hiking in high elevations.Rain Coat: Marmot Mica> ultralight rain and wind jacket. I switched from the heavier Patagonia Torrentshell just before hitting the trail.Like everything else, trail clothes are a very personal choice based upon fit, comfort, price, etc. With that in mind, I would still recommend the switch to Merino wool vs. synthetics and higher quality undergarments like Exofficio. You won't regret it!Let me know if you have any questions or further comments. I'm happy to help in any way. TTFN","Springer Mountain Georgia

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560297,"Happy Easter Everyone!Today's a very special day on my AT journey! I'm back to the trail after a 2 week layoff with my rheumatoid knee. The pain and swelling are gone and I'm anxious to get going again. I'm very thankful for the quick healing, but know that my knee is only at 75% strength. My doctor would have preferred 2 more weeks of rest at home, but I just can't wait that long. In order to prevent future flare ups, I'll have to give myself two injections per week on the trail with Enbrel and Methotrexate. The toughest part is keeping the meds cool which could be a challenge. Cindy will send the meds ahead each week to a local hostel or outfitter. I'm confident that this plan will work out. I've been going at bit stir crazy at home and really missing my trail family. I decided to jump ahead from where I left off in order to rejoin them on the trail. After I summit Katahdin, I'll have to come back and finish the 200+ miles that I missed. I'm meeting Elly and Justin tonight at Black Bear Resort Hostel in Hampton, TN....really looking forward to seeing them. Cindy dropped me off mid-day today after spending a great night at the nearby Roan Mountain B&B. What an awesome place! The customer service and well appointed room were certainly above average. I highly recommend this place. I drove Cindy up to Carver Gap, near the top of Roan Mountain this morning. The views are endless with an elevation near 6000 feet. The balds are absolutely beautiful and some of the most popular spots on the trail. We ran into several thru hikers, including the two German boys who I last saw in Franklin, NC. We all enjoyed catching up and I was happy to see that they're both doing very well. We may see them again in Damascus later this week. It's amazing how easy it is to reconnect with fellow thru-hikers even after a few weeks. My plan for the next several days is to slow down. I can manage 15-18 mile days, but I can't maintain the same pace that I was hiking at prior to my knee problems. One of the popular sayings on the trail is ""hike your own hike"" (HYOH). I won't be able to hike at the same pace as Elly and Justin, but will instead plan on meeting them each afternoon at our desired shelter, hostel or trail town. That way I won't slow them down or negatively affect their journey. I should be at full strength again in a couple of weeks.Thanks for following along and I look forward to sharing all the cool things coming up as we get closer to Virginia.TTFN","Roan Mountain, TN

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560522,"It was great to be back hiking on the AT today and reunited with my trail family. We had a chance to catch up at the hostel last night and hear the stories of the trail from the past two weeks. They have hiked nearly 240 miles while I was recuperating. This is quite impressive! It's obvious that Elly and Justin have gotten their ""trail legs"" and have been able to kick it into another gear. They have also lost a lot of weight even though they were fit to begin with. It's just impossible to eat enough calories each day in order to match your calorie burn.Because this was my first day back to the trail since the knee problems, I knew I would not be able to keep up with Justin and Elly. I want them to hike their own hike and not worry about me. I told them that I would take it slow and meet them at Vandeventer Shelter late in the afternoon. This would be the first day that I hiked alone since I started, but was the best plan for everyone. I had to complete 17.7 miles today with a lot of climbing and steep downhills. It was my toughest day on the trail so far. My knee is still weak and wobbly along with the fact that I lost some fitness the past two weeks. I took more frequent breaks and tried to stretch throughout the day. It was just a long day and I was so thankful to make it to our camping spot for the night. I'm sure I overdid it, but I want to keep pace with our group even if takes me two extra hours per day. It will take me several days to get back ito full strength. I'll just have to leave earlier in the morning and hike longer into the afternoon. As long as there is no swelling I my knee, I should be good to go.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560648,"Somehow I hit a new high today for daily mileage on the trail...19.8. We had planned on doing 14 miles after a big day yesterday, but the trail and the clock had different plans. Our trail family is also super motivated to get into Damascus, Va. tomorrow for rest and some good town food. The thought at getting into a trail town most often alters the daily hiking plan. This is what happened today. We were hiking in rain most of the day with temps in the high 50's. Thankfully the terrain was not as difficult as yesterday. This allowed us to move at a good pace over the first 14 miles. We were done by 2:15 and Justin wanted to press on. I continued on for 6 more miles, while Justin and Elly hiked 9 more. This sets us up for an easy hike into Damascus on Wednesday. I'm camping tonight with another trail family member by the name of Eclipse. I met her the same day I met Elly back in Hiawassee, Ga. She lives in Nashville now after leaving her Museum job in Missouri. She hikes at my current pace, while Justin and Elly have found their rocket trail legs. I met several other hikers on the trail for the first time today. Songbird, Patch and Monarch are lifelong friends from Oklahoma City who adopted Salty from the UK into their trail family. As the father of two grown daughters, it's great to see so many fearless and strong women on the trail. We all made plans to Meetup in Damascus for some good food and beverage. All in all it's been a good two days back on the trail. Fellow hikers really make this journey so much more enjoyable. There are so many really awesome people out here.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560795,"We finished another state today as we hiked out of Tennessee and into Damascus, Virginia. We had rain all night and most of this morning. It's never fun to setup or take down your tent in the rain.. we did both, but got thru it with no issues. Elly and Justin hiked 33 miles yesterday into Damascus just to avoid the rain. This is a crazy number of miles to hike with a full pack. They used their youth and newly developed trail legs to their advantage. Eclipse and I tented in the same area and hiked into Damascus together. Thankfully it was a shorter mileage day after completing a total of 50 miles in three days. The trail was much easier overall with minimal climbs and no steep downhills. We hit town by 1:00 PM. The AT comes out into a sleepy street on the edge of Damascus. It's like your taking a walk in your neighborhood after dinner. The trail goes right thru town leading to a number of hostels and outfitters. The town is much less impressive than Franlklin or even Hot Springs. Most stores and restaurants close by 5:00 which makes it tough to find a place to eat. We settled on a local Taco place that had good food, but was overwhelmed by the number of Thru hikers. We enjoyed each other's company and shared stories from the trail. It was also good to catch up with a couple hikers I had not seen for a few weeks including Ross from Australia. I'm staying at Dancing Bear B&B tonight which is right on the main drag . I wanted a quieter setting than the bunkhouses offered in order to get a better nights sleep. I have a private room with a queen bed that feels like the greatest thing ever.

I was awake and ready to go by 5:30 this morning and couldn't fall back to sleep. My mind and body are always on trail time. Breakfast was served at 9:00 and it was certainly worth the wait. The property owner started with fruit and yogurt, followed by eggs, turkey bacon, sausage gravy and homemade biscuits. It was so filling and delicious. We were joined by a family from Raleigh, NC who were spending spring break in the area. We had a delightful conversation and was able to share some of our experiences from the trail. They were headed over to Grayson Highlands today for a day hike and I was able to recommend some trails and highlights for them to see. I have hiked this area a couple of times with Cindy, my son Dan and other friends. We're only two days away from there now and look forward to seeing the wild ponies again.Zero days in trail towns are not just about resting, but it's a time to resupply, eat a lot of wholesome food and gear prep for the hike out. I got laundry done yesterday which made things a bit easier. I had to stop at the outfitter for new shoe inserts. The old ones were worn out causing some foot discomfort. Super Feet are the most popular inserts on the trail and I was able to find a pair with extra cushioning. Taking care of our feet is always a top priority. I also picked up a pair of sparkplug gaiters to keep rocks and debris out of my shoes. Hopefully this new system works out.After finishing another great lunch at Mojo's (highly recommend), Eclipse and I walked one mile to Food City grocery for resupply of trail food. The store was well equipped for hikers and I was able to find enough food for the next few days. Our next trail town is 63 miles away which will take four days.

It had rained most of the night and the forecast called for thunderstorms throughout the day. We were well prepared, but certainly not looking forward to it. The hike out of town began with the typical uphill. Since we had just finished a big breakfast, it was a little harder than usual. The trail quickly flattened out and we were able to make quick miles in the morning. Our zero day yesterday along with all the great meals gave us a lot of energy today. The AT joins part of the Virginia Creeper biking trail as well with smooth trail and views of roaring rivers. Thankfully the thunderstorms held off and we only had to deal with a light rain.

Today was my 4th consecutive hiking day with rain. It actually rained sideways at times today with wind gusts up to 40 mph as we entered Grayson Highlands. The trail became a river as water flowed down the mountains. My feet look like prunes from all the moisture along with a couple small blisters. These are just normal challenges for AT thru hikers and we have learned to accept it as part of the experience. I'm just thankful that I can be out here to begin with. I was really looking forward to today's hike because it was taking us through one of my favorite hiking spots; Grayson Highlands, Virginia. I have brought family and friends here two of the past three years over Memorial Day weekend for hiking and sightseeing. Mt. Rogers is the highest peak in the state of Virginia at over 5700 ft. It is also home to the wild ponies that roam the area and often come right up to you on the trail (see photos on left). I love the huge rock outcroppings along the trail that make for a fun scramble with incredible views at the top. Unfortunately today's weather made these technical trails quite difficult and dangerous. The trail consists of rocks and boulders that are like ice when the rain is pouring down. We were all very thankful to make it thru this tough section without incident. We experienced some great trail magic about 8 miles in today. The family of a 17 y/o thru hiker from Maryland set up a tent and tables filled with sodas, chips, homemade chocolate chip cookies, ice cream sandwiches and watermelon.

Unfortunately things turned from bad to worse today in what would become my hardest day on the trail to date. Our hiking bubble had collectively decided to hike 20 miles today which would set us up for a short 10 mile hike into Marion, Va. on Monday for resupply. It sounded like a great plan until the Monsoon's hit on Sunday with cooler temps.The trails that were like rivers yesterday had turned into ponds today. We were walking in ankle deep water all day and trying to maneuver around rocks, boulders and tree roots. It was a hard pouring rain all day with major wind gusts and dropping temps. It truly was a test for all the hikers and it took every ounce of energy and intestinal fortitude to finish the day. I stopped at Old Orchard Shelter at the 7 mile mark to warmup and snack. A few other hikers in our bubble stopped as well and we gave each other a lot of encouragement and offfered concerns for each other's safety. I hiked on another 4 miles to Hurricane Mountain Shelter where I found 4 thru hikers stripping off their wet clothes and jumping into sleeping bags to warm up. They appeared hypothermic and could not stop shivering. We offered care and support and moved on when they appeared to be stable. A few hikers decided to hitchhike at the road crossing into Troutville. There was a church Hostel with bunk beds and a warm shower. I thought this was a smart move on their part. I had 4 miles to go to reach our planned destination of the night at Trimpi Shelter. I was cold and my right knee was acting up along with blisters on my left foot. My feet have been soaking wet for 3 days and we're appearing macerated from all the moisture. After nearly 11 hours on the trail, I finally arrived at the Shelter and quickly setup my tent and hung my Bear bag in the rain. I changed into dry clothes, put on my puffy coat and got into my sleeping bag. I was so thankful to make it in without injury or other weather related problems. Our plan is to be up by 5:00 AM and hike the 10 miles into Marion to dry out. I believenow that if I can survive a day like this on the trail, I should be able to handle anything.

The city offers a transit bus to Thru hikers with pickup times of 9:00, 11:00 and 2:30. They only charge $.50 for the five mile ride into town. The visitor center also provided a phone and contact numbers for motels, B&B's, etc. I called the Hiker Inn and got a reservation with early check in. We couldn't wait to take a hot shower and get all of our gear dried out.Since thru hikers are always hungry, we decided to stop at the Mexican restaurant next to the motel for lunch. It hit the spot, but we were already thinking about dinner later this evening. I got into my room and quickly showered before heading down to do laundry. It was so nice to have a washer/dryer on-site for us dirty hikers. I then setup my tent outside to dry out. Thankfully the Cuben Fiber material dried quickly with a little wind. My sleeping bag and air mattress were also damp, so I aired them out in front of the heater in the room. I had every piece of gear, food bag and storage bags scattered throughout the room. After several hours everything was dry and to be repacked.Dinner options were limited by walking distance, so we chose a nearby Chinese buffet. This is right up a thru hikers alley with the tasty all you can eat options. We were fueled up, clean and dried out after a tough few days on the trail. Finally, we had to do a food resupply at the local Ingles grocery store. We picked up enough food and snacks for our next four days up to Bland, Va. Our moods are much brighter as we look forward to sunny days and warmer temps.

The city transit bus picked us up at 11:00 AM and drove us back to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center trailhead. We only had 13.5 miles to do today and the trail map looked fairly easy. There were only minor climbs and downhills which was a pleasant change. We did experience heavy mud and waterlogged trails at the end of the day, but nothing like we had on Sunday. The only bad part was getting our shoes soaking wet again. It's just impossible to get them dried out overnight. We had a couple cool highlights and pleasant surprises today. First, we came across an old schoolhouse in the Virginia countryside that to seemed to appear out of nowhere. Inside, we discovered major trail magic that was provided by a local church in Wytheville, Va. They had cold drinks, chips, snacks and hiker resupply items. It was amazing! The second highlight was having dinner at the Barn Restaurant in Atkins, Va. it was right on the trail is well known to Thru hikers for their famous one pound Hiker burger. Our entire hiking bubble stopped here to eat and to enjoy some end of day conversation. We only had 2 miles to reach our campsite for the night.

We rarely cook breakfast or boil water for coffee. I need to change this plan and take more time each morning. We were on the AT by 9:15 and really looking forward to the day ahead.The sun was bright and strong throughout the day. I had to wear sunscreen to keep from getting burned.

We had the longest climb since entering Virginia up to 4400 feet. The best part of this climb was going thru the Chestnut Ridge Bald near the summit. There are very few trees and appears like a large open meadow. You have 360 degree views and can see forever on a clear day. What a nice treat! I reached Chestnut Ridge Shelter at the top by late morning and had lunch. It's an old stone shelter that is fully enclosed. It opened up to incredible views of the valley below. We learned that the plush valley and farmlands were formed by a limestone sinkhole thousands of years ago. It's beauty is indescribable!
I had six miles to go to reach the meeting point with Cindy. I hustled down the mountain and arrived two minutes before our agreed upon meeting time. The shuttle driver dropped her off minutes later and it was a seeet reunion. She had a chance to meet several folks from my hiking bubble who were coming down the mountain behind me. A thunderstorm was quickly approaching so I decided to take re to a nearby hostel instead of exposing her to severe weather tonight. I called St. Luke's Hostel who arrived in 20 minutes to shuttle us back to the converted farmhouse. We had a private room with great views back towards Chestnut Ridge. We were even treated to a beautiful rainbow following the storm. It was a good decision today stay here, but I was feeling bad for my trailmates.

It's been such a great weekend together, but now I have to start making miles again on the AT. We arrived at the spot where we left off on Friday and said our emotional goodbyes. I was back in the trail by 1:45 PM. 
The trail was fast and easy for the firstv7 mikes into Bland. It was nice to have path with few rocks and roots to worry about. The last half mile was a gravel road that connected directly to Rt. 52. This route takes you into either Bland or Bastian, but the AT goes in the opposite direction. We had a short downhill before crossing over Interstate 77 which was cool. The trail then began a quick climb back up the mountain on the other side. I had been joined by fellow thru hiker McGyver who I had not seen since Hiawassee, Ga. It was great to see him and catch up on his journey. We appear to be on similar pace now and will probably pass each other often in the coming weeks. I also ran into Reroute at the shelter. She was the hiker I mentioned a week ago who had hypothermia from the severe cold and rain. She's doing much better now and I gave her props for not quitting or giving in. We also have a couple of section hikers here tonight from Virginia Beach. They seem to enjoy our stories and experiences along with a few of their own. It's a really good group of people to just hang out with.
It's past hikers midnight and I need some rest for a big mile day tomorrow. We're also expecting storms from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM. Hopefully we dodge this bullet.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562676,"I was up and out on the trail by 8:00 after a lite breakfast and coffee. Rain drops began to fall around 6:00, but it didn't require my rain jacket until later in the afternoon. My hope was to hike st least 20 miles today, but only if my blisters could handle it. I've been dealing with a blister on the ball of my left foot for nearly two weeks. It started with wet feet from all the rain along with a shoe insert that was breaking down. I spend 20-30 minutes each morning on treatment and reassess it throughout the day. I'm using a thin hydrocolloid dressing that is used in hospitals and homecare for similar wounds. It's improving, but has been a slow process due to the location and constant foot pressure, moisture and heat.
The trail was once again easy and fast compared to earlier on the AT. The only difficult spot was hiking over wet rocks during an afternoon rain. We finished the day with a smooth downhill to Kimberling Creek. Today's pic shows the Suspension Bridge over the creek leading to the next road crossing. This road takes you to Trent's Grocery.
I've heard about Trent's Grocery for a couple years because of the unique services it offers thru hikers. First, you can camp in the field behind the store which includes a shower and laundry. The best part though is they serve burgers, hotdogs, deli sandwiches, fries and more inside the store. You can also get ice cream and milkshakes. Several of us ate together tonight including McGyver, Pogo, Bulletproof and Solomon. Pogo is a nice young man from Maryland and Bulletproof is another fierce 20 something female hiker from Canada. We all went to our tents with full bellies and thoughts of breakfast sandwiches in the morning. What a cool little spot. 
My goal for tomorrow is 18-20 mikes in order to set up an early morning arrival into Perisburg on Wednesday. Thankfully The forecast looks good for tomorrow. Heading to bed now since it's past hikers midnight.

Tigger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562825,"After chatting up some local guys over coffee at Trent's Grocery, I hit the trail by 7:50 AM. This may have been the most perfect weather day for hiking since I started. Temps were in the 50's with low humidity and beautiful sunny skies. The first 8 miles to Wapiti Shelter were rather easy with very few ups and downs. I passed by Dismal Falls and followed the Creek for a couple of miles. I scared up my first bear who was hiding in a rhododendron tunnel (click photos). He came out behind me and right in front of a fellow hiker. He was never a threat. 
I had lunch at Wapiti with Pogo and Bulletproof. This Shelter is famous because of two murders that occurred here in 1981. The killer went to prison, but somehow got released in 2007. He came back to the area and shot two fisherman near Dismal Falls. They survived and the shooter was killed following a police pursuit. This is such a rare occurrence on the AT which is historically the safest place to be in the U.S.
I had planned on an 18 mile day to Doc's Knob Shelter, but decided to move in to Pearisburg after dinner there. It was 6:00 PM and I had 8 more miles into town. The hearty meal energized me and I was making quick miles until dark. I had to use my headlamp for the last 2.5 miles. The trail into town is a steep downhill with at least 20 switchbacks. The last 2 miles seemed to take forever and I had another 0.7 miles of road walking to reach downtown Pearisburg. By now I was hungry again and hit up the local Hardee's for a late dinner. I checked into the hostel after 10:00, showered and got to bed. I'll resupply at Food Lion in the morning and get back in the trail by noon with a goal of 15 miles. Glad this long day is over.

I headed across the street to Hardee's for some bacon and egg biscuits with coffee. In my normal life I would never go here for breakfast, but our tastes are different on the AT. I ran into CBiscuit who I last saw in Marion. He's of similar age and continues to make good progress on the trail. Happy to see that!
After breakfast I did laundry to get rid of the hiker stink. Thankfully the motel/Hostel had a washer and dryer on site; that's always a bonus. While waiting for laundry to finish I went thru my food bag to see what I would need for resupply. I made my list and went to Food Lion when my clothes were done. Since all these stores are new to me, I have to walk each aisle to find what I need. It went fairly quickly and I was able to get a full resupply for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. I'm good to go for up to 5 days. 
I was ready to leave town by noon and get back in the trail. I couldn't resist one last stop at the DQ for a large shake and burger. This would fuel me up for the climb ahead.
The first 6 miles out of town was uphill. It was a good workout, but nothing like we had in Georgia and North Carolina. At the top was a Bald with incredible views of the town and valleys below. The trail followed the ridge for the remaining part of the day. We had fantastic views all afternoon. The weather once again was perfect for hiking.
I had 2 more bears run out in front of me today. They were moving fast and showed little interest in me. I also spooked a whitetail deer right before reaching our campsite.

The trail today was much slower and more technical due to the large amount of rocks. You have everything from small rocks to bolders that you have to maneuver around and over for long periods of time. It is my least favorite type of trail to hike on. We had a few climbs today, but one in particular was straight up for over a mile which got the heart pumping pretty good.
Once in awhile on the trail you pass by sites that are well known to the thru hiking community. Today I passed ""The Captains"" which is known for its zip line across a stream into a backyard. For many years this gentleman has allowed hikers to zip line with backpacks into his yard and camp for free. Pretty cool!
I've been pushing hard this week with big miles and it finally caught up with me. With rains coming in at 5:00 I decided to setup camp early on the backside of an overlook.

I started off fast before hitting the rock ledges on the edge of the mountain (click photo). These were quite tricky and required great caution. The views of the Blue Ridge Mountains from this vantage point were incredible. Shortly thereafter I passed the Eastern Continental Divide sign. Pretty cool!
The trail continued downhill to Craig's Creek which had several footbridge crossovers. It's kind of a small world because I used to fish this Creek often in the early 90's when we lived in nearby Roanoke. I took one final snack before starting the big climb of the day. We had a 1500 ft vertical climb over 3 miles to reach the top of Brush Mountain. Here is where I discovered the highlight of the day...the Audie Murphy Monument. Audie Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War II. Sadly, he died in plane crash on this mountain in 1971. It was a very moving tribute to see veterans from past and current wars leave things like Dog Tags and Service Coins around the monument. He was a true American hero!

The highlight of today's hike was reaching Dragons Tooth. It's the first jewel of the Virginia Triple Crown that also includes Mcafee Knob and Tinkers Cliffs. Hiking up to and down from Dragons Tooth is very technical and dangerous. It's a combination of rock climbing, bouldering and hiking all in one. It gives you a full body workout and more. 
We made it down to the road crossing and only had .3 miles to the 4 Pines Hostel. I had stayed here last fall on a trip with my Dayton/Cincinnati hiking group. It's an old three car garage that was converted into a hostel with multiple sofas, cots and mattresses spread around...very eclectic. I decided to set my tent up in the field behind.
