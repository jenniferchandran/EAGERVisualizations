Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550577,"""Sandy has already started telling others that I am hiking the AT in 2017,"" Scout wrote back after I described my retirement plan to complete the triple crown of US hiking.
""Do you think that the world could take the team of Scout and Rolling Thunder?""

And with that my AT hike changed instantly. 

Those who are regular followers of my trail journals will know that Scout – Barney Mann in the other world, a former lawyer, erstwhile PCTA chairman, San Diego trail angel extraordinaire, author and, of course, thru-hiker – and I have walked in each other’s footprints for 10 years.

I was hiker #2 at his San Diego home (still miffed that arriving one day earlier could have made me #1) before my PCT hike in 2006.

He and Sandy – the not-yet-named Frodo – met my group along the trail several times as they prepared for their own hike in 2007, at one point carrying in a cold can of Fosters beer for me and at others providing both moral and legal guidance when the dramas of my off-trail life required that.



To assuage a tiny part of my karmic debt, I flew back over to the US from New Zealand for their PCT thru-hike in 2007, hauling in with go-BIG a resupply so they could continue from Kennedy Meadows to Muir Trail Ranch in one hit. 

When I tackled the CDT in 2010, he walked with our group on the relatively meritless section between Grants and Pietown, after having carried up a cold can of Fosters up to the 11,300ft summit of Mt Taylor to surprise me. (The surprise was rather ruined when we failed to cross paths because my group followed the road instead of a new section of trail since we didn't know if it had been completed.) He and Sandy were my transcribers for my BurritoQuest trail journal on the CDT. 



A few years later, he hiked the CDT himself – sometimes with Frodo, sometimes with her in support. 

So I shouldn’t be surprised that now we’re both retired, our paths should finally coalesce for a long trail – southbound on the AT, starting with a 130-mile warm up wander from the Canadian border on the International Appalachian Trail.

I’ve been blessed with amazing hiking buddies over the years, but I can’t think of one I’d rather do a thru hike with than Scout.

He’s already started dreaming of the AT. (For my part, my dreams are currently consumed by the byzantine bureaucracy involved in leaving Abu Dhabi.) 

But, as he put it recently, this hike will not be like the others: “I guess that's another way the AT will be different – no RT journal to whet my appetite.”",,View Entry,"Oct 17, Mon",0

So from today I'm officially retired, thanks in large part to earnings from eight years working as a journalist in the Middle East and selling my quake house in New Zealand.


Half a world away in San Diego, Scout and Frodo responded to my retirement by raising a glass of champagne.



First up is my year of hiking, about 6,500km that will culminate -- hopefully -- in the AT, sobo from June.

So does that mean I'm I retired, or now a full-time hiker?",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Wed",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551791,"The first project of my so-called year of hiking was about as different from the AT as it was possible to get: a camel-supported guided trek through the high desert of the Sinai peninsula.


But since the effects of the Gulf's punishing summer climate meant that I was the least active and least fit I'd been in years, it seemed wise to ease into the hiking again. Camel support meant we could hike just with light day-packs. 

But by far the highlight of the trip was the insight it provided into Bedouin life. It took a while to fully appreciate their absolute mastery of this life -- a bit like a day-hiker joining a thru-hiker on the final month of their trek -- and to get into the comforting rhythms of desert travel.


And better still, it allowed the Bedouins to make a living while maintaining their traditional lifestyles. This was why the trail was created in 2015, to reverse the disastrous decline in tourism revenues caused by Egypt's political unrest. 

This decline was accelerated when the local ISIL franchise smuggled a bomb onto a Russian charter flight from Sharm El Sheikh, killing all 224 on board and ending virtually all tourism.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557316,"There are plenty of reasons why the Israel Trail ought to appear on any long-distance hiker's bucket list. There's the stark beauty of the Negev desert, there's the chance to walk amid historic sites such as the plain where David defeated Goliath, and there's the chance to become enveloped in the unique Jewish culture of Israel. 



One of the explanations I commonly used during this hike was that everyone knows the Israel of the media headlines and I wanted to see the complicated but nuanced version of Israel that existed beyond that, through encountering the country at walking pace and by meeting ordinary Israelis. The comment usually went down well, because Israelis often feel perplexed about being misunderstood by much of the rest of the world.

But the bit about the ""Israel of the headlines"" was more than just a bit of wordplay. As a journalist who'd worked in the Middle East for the past eight years, I'd written more than my share of those headlines. 



But I'd never been there, and along with all the hiking reasons to visit, I wanted to understand why Israelis make the decisions they do. As I also told some of those I met, Israelis make different decisions compared to people elsewhere but that cannot be disentangled from the fact that their back-story is also different to every else's. 

What I was really wanted to do on this hike was to walk a metaphorical mile in Israelis' shoes by walking more than 600 literal miles from the Red Sea to the border with Lebanon and Syria.



I'd written this journal during my time in Israel but only began publishing it after my departure because, as anyone will soon discover if they delve deeper into my full INT journal from the link to the left, I'm no great fan of current Israeli policy and voicing what I was thinking on any particular day might not have been consistent with being permitted to remain in the country.

I suspect the majority of you who have no interest in such political and cultural considerations -- or who believe Israel can do no wrong -- will be better served by either just looking at the photos or being prepared to skim over large sections of the text.



My INT journal also includes some ancillary walking in Palestine afterwards. I'd had a vague plan to get the other side of the story by hiking the full 800km length of the separation barrier that envelops the West Bank but after doing about 50km of that, I abandoned the plan as too messy. Where there was the concrete barrier, the Palestinians built right up to and sometimes onto it, which made walking near it difficult. Most of the barrier is made up of a razor-wire fence, but trying to walk near that often led to me being chased off by IDF soldiers or the police.



So instead I visited the main cities of the West Bank, attended some Friday protests, and hiked along what's known as Apartheid Street in Hebron, where IDF soldiers direct Jews and western tourists to walk on one side of the road and Muslims are forced to walk on the other, amid garbage and other debris. Whoever is in charge of teaching history in Israel doesn't seem to be doing a very good job.



I also did a section of the Masar al Ibrahim (the Path of Abraham), the relatively newly-created Palestinian counterpart to the Israel Trail.



I emerged from two and a half months in Israel depressed by the diminishing prospects of a peaceful outcome but with the more nuanced perspective I'd sought. I'd also been shocked, humbled, surprised and challenged in a way like no other countries I've ever been to before. I'd been showered with hospitality from all sides ... well, maybe not the IDF.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563926,"The benefits of my newfound luxury of time included being able to spend 6-7 weeks as a trail angel on the PCT to assuage some of my karmic debt before heading east for the AT. 

I split my time between Scout and Frodo's in San Diego, tending to the needs of some of the 900 or so hikers due to pass through their doors this year, and then moved up to Casa de Luna, the Andersons' enclave of awesomeness in Green Valley, north of Los Angeles. 

This gave me the time to do a series of Humans of New York-style interviews with this year's hikers, which was a kind of proof-of-concept for a greater project to which I'm aiming to devote time in my real retirement. The 160-plus vignettes featured on www.facebook.com/Humans.of.PCT... received somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 hits. 
These are some of my favourites.



Dixie, Alabama. ""I was an engineer before I started the AT. I woke up at 28 one day and [thought] I have two wonderful dog children and a good job and I'm freaking miserable. To me, I had all the ingredients to the recipe of happiness that society casts upon you but I wasn't happy so I decided it was time to get out. I quit my job and cashed in all my retirement. I hiked the AT with no real intentions of doing another trail but I started a YouTube channel [Homemade Wanderlust]. I didn't think anything would actually come of it but people started watching it while I was hiking. After I finished the trail, I had all these people asking me questions [like] what do you eat and what do you this and what do you that so I posted once a week on whatever topic -- water or packs or sleeping bags. Now I have almost 30,000 subscribers. I did an e-book and together with a lot of part time jobs, it essentially funded this trip. I'd never been on an overnight backpacking trip before hiking the AT two years ago and I haven't since then -- [the PCT] is my second overnight hiking trip. If I can do it, anyone can do it.""

Has the AT answered the question you were asking when you quit your job and started hiking? 

""Pretty much. I've never felt so much like myself than when I was on the AT. You go out to the trail and you become the person you really are because all the facade and all that crap just crumbles away. You have friends and whatever [in normal life] but in the trail community, it's like 'Wow, this actually fits'. Now I'm ruined for life, and I want everyone else to go out and ruin their lives like I did.""



Trudge, Washington DC. ""In 1979, I didn't plan to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail but there was an accident at a place called the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. I lived just over five miles away and the government said 'It's safe -- just stay inside and keep your windows closed but if you're pregnant you should leave'. We thought if it's not good for pregnant women, it probably wasn't good for the rest of us. I could have just stayed around and absorbed the radiation but instead I started hiking south from near the [AT] midway point. It was just luck that the trail just south of there passes through Harpers Ferry, where the Appalachian Trail Conference is, so I could get some maps. When I got to the southern end, I hitchhiked up to the northern end and hiked back to Pennsylvania. I've wanted to do the PCT ever since and it's taken me 38 years to get around to it.""



Bex, England. ""As you can see, I'm a little bit larger and I want to slim down and get myself healthy again. If I left it to next year, there'd be no way I'd be coming, just the way that my weight and health was going. With the weight gain, I've got lazier and less confident. I was this weight for many years but about six years ago, I lost about six and a half stone (91 pounds) through diet and exercise. Then three years ago I lost my mum, my best friend in the world, and I just stopped caring. My mum died at 53 and I don't want to go that early. Back at home, the reaction [to my plan to hike] the PCT was often negative. The hiking community [at Scout and Frodo's] has been amazingly supportive. It's a huge factor. In the past, there's not been one single fitness challenge I've not been able to complete -- people have doubted me and I've proven them wrong. I'm human and I love that face people pull when you prove them wrong.""



Ox, Tennessee. ""In 2010-11, I deployed with my battalion to Afghanistan and on January 29 of 2011, I lost two great Americans. Ox was the nickname for one of those, so I asked his father if I could use his name as my trail name. His name was Specialist Shawn Muhr. Over the course of 2011, I lost a total of five soldiers [in combat]. I knew them all, not like their platoon leader or company commander, [but] you feel a sense of responsibility and I never had the chance to just heal from that and decompress. When I retired in December of 2015, I decided to memorialise these young men and hike the Appalachian Trail and do some healing. I started the Appalachian Trail on January 29.""
""I carried the five young men's dog tags on my shoulder strap and that was my motivation when I was not feeling it during the AT. I said to myself 'These kids didn't give up, Ox, so you need to push on'. For anyone doing an endurance event, it's more mental than physical. I'm carrying the five dog tags on the shoulder strap of my pack on the PCT. Sharing this story has been healing. I didn't think it would be, but sharing my story is memorialising my fallen.""

What is it about long trails that's healing, particularly for military veterans? 

""There are many things. For me, it's the quietness and the beauty. All of my senses were on high alert. It reminded me of combat but it was kind of in my safe place, so when I was out on the trail I could smell things that normally I couldn't smell and I could hear so much clearer. I had no deadlines to meet and had the ability to do what I wanted to do. When I was out hiking, I was at peace. I expected some of that, but not to the degree that it happened. To build on that, the trail community renewed my faith in humanity. With the hikers -- the day hikers, section hikers and thru hikers -- and the residents in the towns neighbouring the trail, I have story after story after story of things they did. I never asked for any of it but they were there to help. 

""Reaching Katahdin was very emotional. I struggled [with re-entry]. My lower extremities were beat up pretty good. I'm a runner and I couldn't run. I got depressed and I don't know what depressed feels like, but I was depressed. I almost went back on the trail. The only thing that held me back was I was beat up pretty good. The solution was time. I gave back through volunteering and working on my cabin.""



Anonymous hiker. ""I'm hiking this year because my marriage ended, but I'm like the opposite of Cheryl Strayed in 'Wild'. She went out on the PCT to go way outside her comfort zone with this big adventure. I'm doing it because I've got years and years of mountaineering and hiking experience and out here, I understand all the rules. I proved to be spectacularly bad at being married so this trip is to remind myself that there's stuff I'm actually good at. I'm on the trail because I'm going into my comfort zone.""



JD, Indiana. ""I lost 80 pounds so I'd be in shape to do the trail. I was up over 300 pounds when I started. When I first got a bicycle, I couldn't ride it a mile and a half, but then I built up to 30-40 mile rides. I rode the bike first to lose the weight and then started hiking.""

So you could barely ride a mile and a half and now you're doing a 2,650 mile hike? That's really impressive.

""It's been a good journey so far and it's going to get better.""



Whisper and Jim, daughter and father from Massachusetts. 

Whisper: ""The big reason why I wanted to hike [the Appalachian Trail last year] was because hiking is very therapeutic to me. I had a lot of stuff going on in high school. When I asked [my dad] about doing the AT, instead of what I expected him to say, which was 'Why don't you volunteer here and spend a semester at home?', he said 'Why don't you do the whole Eastern Continental Trail' -- which goes from Quebec to Florida -- 'instead of just doing half of the Appalachian mountains?'. [The hike] was really amazing. I mean, there is something about being surrounded by trees that just changes your brain chemistry. I decided I was going to hike the PCT while I was hiking the AT.""

Jim: ""When she told me about hiking the AT, I thought it was ambitious and I was a little nervous [but] I thought 'This is something she wants to do and I'm not going to kill the dream'. I said 'Sure' and the next day she had a website and she was fundraising. She was a better person [after the trail]. She was at ease with the world. She was a great person anyway. When I was 17, I hitch-hiked up to Maine and I tell it as if it's a great adventure, and she's walking the length of the country."" 



Anonymous hiker, California. ""I'd wanted to hike the PCT before I got really, really sick about eight years ago. I had one of the worst cases of valley fever, which is in the dirt in southern California. Ninety per cent of people get symptoms like the flu but one in a million get as sick as I was -- liver, pancreas and kidney failure. The hospital told me I wasn't going to make it. I spent eight and a half months in a hospital bed and it's taken until now to stabilise my health enough to do the hike. I'm carrying eight pounds of medical equipment. I was supposed to start a month ago, so I didn't have to deal with keeping my insulin cool in the desert, but I got hospitalised for a week. I can't get my feet wet because I get diabetic ulcers. I can't be a purist and do every foot, but I can do as much as I can.""

Miya and Kaden, Oregon. 

Kaden: ""I'm 10. Mom went in a meditation, looking for a job. The meditation told her to go to a trail to get away from society so she looked up trails and the PCT was the first trail that came up."" 

Miya: ""I just put in 'long distance trails'. We started researching it and it's well-travelled and kids have already travelled it and we decided that that was what we were going to do. This was almost a year ago, and I've found out my eyes are getting worse and it's perfect timing because I have to leave my job anyway. I'm a project manager in the biopharmaceutical industry. Basically I was told in my meditation that it would come to me what I'm supposed to be doing next and to get away from society and to clear my mind and my body. I have glaucoma. It's treatable but I have an extreme glaucoma so they can't keep my pressures down. I've had it 22 years and I'm hoping I won't go blind but I'm already having blindness in my right eye. That's my thought: experience life with him while I have full vision and here we go.""



Tine, Belgium. ""Originally the plan was to sail around the world. My husband and I were going to finish work in five years (in 2020) and then sail the world. Two years ago he got cancer and died.""

Were you tempted to go and sail around the world anyway?

""I'd done some sailing courses in Belgium but, no, that was more a dream of him. I read a book, Wild, while on holiday in Sri Lanka and I thought I'd do this. Not many people thought I would do it.""



Maggie, Pennsylvania. ""My friend Sarah and I are shaving our heads and donating our hair to Pantene [Beautiful Lengths] before starting the trail. Long hair has been part of my identity for so long. I think it's going to go one of two ways -- I'm going to either cry or piss my pants. I'm probably going to cry but really, I don't know.""

Postscript: Maggie got in touch to say that ""Sarah Komisar donated 17inches and I donated 20 inches!"" Asked which of the two predicted outcomes panned out, she replied: ""Neither. It was a really fun time!""



Breakaway, Oregon. 

Today you completed the last of the fire closures you missed in last year's hike, finishing the entire trail 364 days after you started it. Congratulations!

""Thanks! These are totally honourary Washington conditions -- it was misty and windy and cold. I figured it was fitting to finish my last empty section. I felt like I'd done the PCT when I reached the monument last year but it's cool to say 'OK, now I've really done everything I can'. I had some time off and there were a lot of places I could do some spring backpacking but I figured I'd come back here and meet the Class of 2017 and help out at the Andersons. It was a good way to use that time -- I've met some pretty rad people.""

What's with the Buckfast Tonic Wine? 

""I hiked a lot of the trail last year with this Irish fellow called Shepherd and I'd heard of this stuff and I kept asking him about it. I met up with him this past winter in Salt Lake and he'd got this for me when he went back to Ireland for Christmas. It's apparently the Four Loko of the British isles -- fortified wine with caffeine in it. It's been 'cellaring' since then. I think I'm really too old to be drinking this but I'm curious. It doesn't taste that bad. Or that good.""

You brought your finisher's medal with you.

""I ordered it sometime last fall and it showed up sometime over the winter when I was in Utah.""

Have you worn it before?

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566480,"""So, what's your connection to the International Appalachian Trail?""

The immediate and spontaneous laughter of those around me suggested that maybe, just maybe, I'd made another of my innumerable faux pas.

Dick Anderson just smiled and replied: ""Well, it was my idea.""

All I'd known was that I'd be with Scout, Frodo and our gracious Portland host, Seth, visiting someone connected to the international extension to the AT but I hadn't realised it was the person who, back in 1994, had the original idea of a hiking trail covering the full Appalachian range as it headed northwards from Mt Katahdin and into Canada.

Once he'd voiced the idea, others then pointed out that, thanks to the vagaries of plate tectonics, the mass of rock which formed the basis for the range extended beyond Canada and on to Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Scotland, France, Spain and Morocco, among many, many others. 

I regained a tiny amount of lost credibility when I looked at the IAT's range and was able to inform them that I'd already climbed the highest peak of the IAT.
Toubkal, a 4167m pile of choss in the Atlas mountains, happened to not just be the highest summit of Morocco and north Africa but also of the nascent IAT.

Further redemption followed during an enjoyable and wide-ranging discussion on the IAT when I explained I'd also been to the potential northernmost part of the trail in Spitsbergen but, in truth, I remained deep in negative territory after my initial burst of ignorance.

Our meeting with Dick was bookended by a couple of public lectures Scout had given about his PCT book.



The first was in Redlands, outside Los Angeles, to a university crowd that was his biggest yet -- about 350 people filling a large auditorium. 



He's seriously playing some big rooms! 



We then took the red-eye flight to Boston, where we hired a car and drove to Maine 

The next, at Portland craft ale house following our meeting with Dick 



This was the polar opposite: a tough crowd that didn't really get into it until he started telling some of the fascinating stories from the earliest days of the PCT.

After that, we headed north towards Houlton, where we'd booked a motel about an hour's drive from the northern boundary of the Maine section of the IAT.

After a couple of months of helping out hundreds of PCT hikers at Scout and Frodo's and then at Casa de Luna with Terrie and Joe Anderson, I'm really looking forward to actually hiking.


Except it'd be really nice if it could stop raining for a little while...",,View Entry,"May 26, Fri",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566850,"Our first lesson on the IAT was this: when the ATV tracks on the border swath separating the US and Canada disappeared, it inevitably meant there was something terrible ahead. 



The reason was simple enough. The arbitrary path of the 40ft-wide swath is based on degrees of longitude chosen by bureaucrats who never had to come this way so it goes across whatever is there on the ground, whether it be cliffs, rolling hills or, in the case of the places where the ATV path vanished, swamps.

This was all familiar ground to me, based on my years of hiking in New Zealand's damper places such as Fiordland and Stewart Island, where annual rainfall is around 10 metres or so. Progress required utilising the kiwi skill set I'd dubbed ""quagmire gymnastics"", which involved bypassing boggy sections by clinging to vegetation on the fringe of the swamp while leaning outwards over the muddy morass.

Half an hour into today's walk, I'd come to a moss-filled pool maybe one metre across and almost ventured in before distant memories of similar previous bogs came to the front of my psyche and I backed off in favour off a less direct and more complicated but ultimately less risky option. 

Possibly because bog walking isn't a common skill set in southern California, Scout soon after encountered a similar situation but opted to try his luck -- and promptly sunk to above his knees. Then he discovered the challenge of getting out without leaving his shoes behind. 



Being a caring and dedicated hiking partner, of course I supported him in his moment of need by capturing all this on my camera. 



We'd already long since adopted another kiwi tramping tactic by abandoning the concept of maintaining dry feet, which freed us from even more convoluted attempts to avoid the boggy areas. It's so much more freeing to just embrace the idea of wet feet and deal with it. I think there had been maybe a handful of trips I did in the New Zealand outdoors where my feet were dry more than an hour into the tramp.

Combined with the black flies and mosquitoes, the conditions we'd encountered thus far had supported what we'd been told that morning by Cheryl and Kirk, two IAT stalwarts from northern Maine who had been kind enough to meet us for breakfast and give us the benefits of their trail beta.



The two-adjective executive summary of their advice was this: it'd be buggy and boggy. 

The longer version included telling us where the good shelters were, what the early water sources were like, that ticks didn't occur this far north and how to avoid a particularly unpleasant walk on a narrow highway used by logging trucks via a couple of ATV trails.

They lived about an hour away from the start of the trail at the Fort Fairfield border station, just outside the small eponymous Maine town, but took the meeting with us as an excuse to come down and do some early trail maintenance on the first shelter on the trail, about five miles away. On top of their help, they literally gave us the caps from their heads.



Frodo then drove us as we followed Cheryl and Kirk to border station, where a amiable customs and immigration officer was happy for to cross over to the border monument and then come back in.



After the usual border photo, we headed down the lightly travelled road because even by IAT standards, it turned out the first few miles of the border swath were even boggier (and probably buggier) than the bits we were about to do.


Some previous nobo zealot had opted for the direct route, Cheryl and Kirk had told us earlier, but had ended up wading chest-deep through beaver ponds. We were happy not to follow suit.



Instead we walked on the road briefly then turned onto an even quieter road that dead ended at the border swath.



Just as we arriving there, Cheryl and Kirk were coming back on their ATV from visiting the IAT lean to, our first of a gazillion or so we'll see this summer on the IAT and the AT.

""You'll be in Georgia by September at this rate,"" Kirk quipped. The porcupine they'd told us about earlier -- having taken up residence, first at the lean to and then in the outhouse -- had apparently found somewhere better to live. 



A little under two hours after starting, we reached the lean to and went in to have a look. It would have made a fine place to stay, although it was a little disturbing to notice all the tall trees surrounding it were dead.



Scout and I wrote in the log book, variously noting our gratitude for the unsung heroes like Cheryl and Kirk who keep these things going but also noting the gratitude for us for having the forms of wealth -- financial, health, time etc -- to be able to do long hikes in our retirement. Scout, at 65, was particularly aware that this was a privilege denied to many.



The navigation, it had to be said, was not challenging. The border swath ran dead straight, usually with an ATV trail meandering amid the 40ft zone.



The border markers ran from short stubby concrete ones through to large stainless steel and granite ones of a shape we remembered all too well from the northern terminus of the PCT.



For a while, we were lulled into a sense of optimism by the good trails we were following. 



And then the ATV trail disappeared, veering off into Canada. 

And then Scout discovered why.



There were other challenges, including a plant that had an oily sheen on its ""leaves of three"", making us suspect it might be poison ivy. I was familiar with poison oak on the west coast but had encountered its ivy equivalent and had no wish to discover if it was a problem. We gave it a wide berth. 



Soon enough it was back to normal.



Until we hit a series of beaver dams.



But there was usually a route through and the dam walls proved to be an unexpectedly easy path.



By then we could see our destination: the wind towers on top of Mars Hill.





The terrain became increasingly hilly. This being the border, but clearly channeling the AT's famous directness, the path went straight up and straight down the steep part of the hills.

This was broken around 2pm by arriving at Easton border crossing point, where we knew we could refill with beavery-free water.



It provided a good place to have lunch, 



On the way to the border patrol point, I'd been seeing increasingly obvious signs that it was indeed here and not one hill further. That hill was particularly steep and I was hoping to avoid it on this first day of our hike but also didn't want to say anything about it in case I was wrong and had raised hopes unnecessarily.



So when this was indeed the border station and knowing that we turned in to Mars Hill using a sealed road, I assumed that this was one and the same. Scout quickly set me right -- as I'd have known if I'd bothered to read the map -- so we ended up having to climb the hill I thought I'd avoided.

We'd done about 12 miles by this point and I was feeling it. My philosophy has long been that the only real way to get fit for thru-hiking is by thru-hiking, ensuring it is done at a pace that eased your body into it. 

Scout had a book deal in the offing and had the goal to finish by his birthday in mid-October, which would involve a fast hike of four months and three weeks or so. That'd be fast just for the AT, let alone with the extra 138 miles of the IAT added onto it.

What that meant for us was that although we had tents, we were aiming for the Mars Hill lean to, a challenging distance of 18.8 miles -- a solid first day.

We climbed the hill I thought we'd avoided -- which of course exacerbated the pain of it being the steepest we'd encountered yet. A second unpleasant discover was being engulfed in a mass of black flies, showing that the terrain had put us below the flies' 2mph pace. It was a powerful message against slothfulness on trail.



However we still had time to interact with border patrol guys, one of whom knew about the IAT. We'd had to advise the patrol that we were walking the border swath so they knew we were a particularly incompetent pair of illegal immigrants.



As we found the correct road to leave the border swath and headed up Mars Hill, I was really feeling it.

The IAT featured real trail here, although it was more of a marked route than a trail, apparently in the hope that traffic would bed it in in the absence of larger-scale engineering. 

""I thought this hill was small,"" I thought to myself as I sweated to the top, finding new patches of maybe-poison-ivy to avoid.



Even when we emerged among the wind farm towers, the road undulated in a way that depleted my remaining energy levels.

Just before we topped out, we met some young local ATVers, who were bringing equipment for friends who were staying at the lean to. After advising them of a back door way to the lean to -- a downed tree had blocked their way -- we reconciled ourselves to sharing the lean to with others.



They were a bunch of young men from the nearby community and had all the usual quantities of alcohol one would expect. 



But they were also pleasant and respectful guys, trying to say they didn't plan a huge party and we were very welcome to stay in the shelter too. But I was ready to drop and was going to bed at 8pm so I pitched my tent, too tired to eat. I'd yogied a beer from one of the guys but only managed half of it and couldn't even contemplate eating the subway wrap I'd been carrying since breakfast.

As I lay, semi comoatose, in my sleeping bag, Scout came over and asked for a second opinion about a suspected tick bite. 

I'll have to admit that I asked hesitantly: ""Um, just where is it?"" and envisaging a close inspection of something both gray and sagging. 



It was, thankfully, on his outer thigh. With the help of my camera's macro function and zoom, we were able to confirm it was indeed a deer tick -- a potential carrier of lyme disease, which Scout had suspected was going to be the single biggest risk to us successfully thru-hiking the AT.

We removed it, hoping we'd got the head and relying on the theory that disease is only transmitted when ticks are embedded for 24 hours or more. Even the most pessimistic estimate of when he was bit was barely 11 hours. But it still shook us -- particularly because it was so small, unlike the ticks I'd encountered before on long hikes, but had a disproportionate risk of contagion. 

IAT fact of the day: The nondescript concrete marker a few feet from my campsite marks the first place in the US that sees the sun during the summer months. Based on how wiped out I was, something told me I wasn't going to be awake to see it.","US-Canada border crossing, Fort Fairfield
",Mars Hill,"May 27, Sat",18.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566965,"Navigation on the IAT, it ought to be said, has not been that challenging.

However we might have expected today's routefinding to have been more challenging than yesterday, when we followed a dead straight 40ft-wide clearcut swath heading south on a line somewhere between the 45th and 46th degrees of longitude. 

But then we found that most of today's route was similarly straight because the IAT follows the path of the former Bangor and Aroostock railroad. 

If anything, it was even easier because instead of undulating up and down hills, traversing swamps and beaver dams because of the arbitrary nature of international borders, the multi-use trail on the former railroad track was not just straight but also flat. And without a bog in sight. 

Scout breathed a sigh of relief.



First though, we had to descend Mars Hill. 

We'd camped within a few feet of the place that is the first to see the sun for the summer months. But sometime during the night, a thick wet layer of cloud enveloped the mountain, soaking our tents in condensation, and at dawn the remnants of it denied us the chance to bask in sunshine before everyone else in the US. 

Or it would have denied me if I hadn't still been fast asleep after the previous day's exertions.

We packed up and headed off around 6.30am, retracing our steps to where the trail descends to the town of Mars Hill via a combination of the winter ski pistes and short sections of trail through the forest when the ski route became too steep for easy travel. We even found our first blue blazes.



After a little over three miles, we walked into the village and immediately made our way to Al's Diner for breakfast.



Appropriately fortified with a mix of grease, caffeine and carbohydrates, we began following the old railway bed past what were clearly once warehouses connected to the rail line.



What can you say about walking on a former railroad line? 



Being the sunny middle day of a holiday weekend, we were passed by gazillion ATVs. 



The route was straight and fast and quiet. 



And maybe a little boring, but give that to me over quagmire gymnastics any day.





By early afternoon, we found our next IAT lean to near Monticello. 



And we might have stayed there but just 1.7 miles further there was the famous Blue Moose, which purveyed a similarly appealing mix of mix of grease, caffeine and carbohydrates to bookend Al's Diner that morning.



After crossing a former railroad viaduct, we encountered another friendly border patrol agent, this one on a quad bike about to embark on a long loop along the border swath south of Mars Hill. The grin on his face at being paid to blast around on an ATV in the summer and a snowmobile in the winter was evident, as was his acknowledgement that this was counterbalanced by the in-between seasons, when he has to ply the border in waders in snow and meltwater.

He also gave us the beta that the Blue Moose was ""just behind that shack"", suggesting it was a minute or two's walk away. We thanked him and walked on, only to discover that his estimate of distance was skewed by motorised transport and the way he'd pointed to was a dogleg adding more than a mile to the route compared to staying on the old rail bed.



We retraced our steps back to the railroad bed and soon found signs pointing to the ""resterant"".



I was glad to still be far more with it than I'd been at the end of the previous day and we settled in for a colossal meal, even by the standards of American servicing sizes.

But the enticing combination of food, warmth and beer quickly did me in. Scout was roundly defeated by his magnificent pot roast and I barely managed half of my own lasagna by the time the restaurant closed at 7pm. 

We headed out to a mown area behind in which IAT hikers are welcome to pitch their tents. The lawn was soft and awesome, but it could have been full of jagged rocks and I'd still have been asleep within minutes. 

Two days in and we've done 40 miles. Aren't we uber-hikers supposed to know to avoid the classic rookie thru-hiker error of going out too fast too soon???","Mars Hill
",Blue Moose restaurant,"May 28, Sun",21
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567420,"The price of 28 miles of fast and easy walking along the old railroad line became apparent when we finally left the multi-use trail on the outskirts of Houlton.
The IAT changed to the nearby ATV trails, which took a brutally direct route through the kind of undulations that needed to be tamed for train use but which were manna from heaven for off roaders.
For me, it was somewhat less than heavenly, captured by my involuntary exclamation of: ""Ack! My legs don't work!""
As with the first day's quagmire gymnastics, this too was familiar ground from years of adventure racing and triathlons, when the transitions from either cycling or kayaking to running prompted a similar kind of muscular rebellion.
And like in those sports, my leg muscles that had become accustomed to fast and flat walking eventually adjusted to their new roles after a couple of minutes -- painful and awkward minutes.
We'd almost managed what was known in thru-hiking hiking lore as a ""ten by ten"": 10 miles by 10am. But given the absurdly easy terrain compared to the famously difficult terrain of the AT, this seemed to be no great achievement and we turned our focus to a different goal: visiting what is probably the US's sole trailside Tim Horton's.
This Canadian fast food chain had been started decades ago by -- inevitably -- an ice hockey star. When it arrived in the UAE in the last few years, it caused spontaneous exultations of unbridled joy from the Emirates' expatriate Canadian community.
Although my hiker hunger is yet to set in, arriving at the Tim Horton's led to a similar exultations from me too. Soon we had a late breakfast of the essential food elements.
When combined with the power outlets, this meant we settled in for a couple of hours of bringing our journals up to date then wandered over to an even more improbable landmark: a trailside WalMart.
The forecast has been for rain on the next couple of days (this was before we began to realize that there are only a couple of days a year when rain isn't forecast for the mountains of northern Maine) so I bought a cheap umbrella and poncho for the next few days of road walking and a lightweight mirror so I'd never need to ask anyone to inspect my nether regions for ticks. 
Scout bought a magnifying glass to check whether he'd actually managed to extract the first day's tick head along with the rest of it, although I suspect his main reason was to have the chance to get a photograph with the WalMart greeter.
After that we began what is generally accepted to be the least pleasant section of the IAT: about 60 miles of road walking until the point where we headed into the woods surrounding Mount Katahdin.
But even this had its benefits, including the ability to have a good look at the farmhouses we were walking past. I think it said it all when nearly every one featured a farm bigger than the actual farmhouse -- a sure sign of a real working rural community.
And amid the architectural conformity, we happened upon a seriously out of place boat.
in the midst of all this a car heading our way stopped and it took a while to recognise this was Frodo and our hire car. On her way back from Prince Edward island, she'd spurned the interstate in favor of our minor road in the hope of running into us.
""What have you done with my husband?"" she quizzed me before allowing me to dump my pack in the back seat so we could slackpack the rest of the way. I was able to point out Scout, who was just ahead.
An hour or so later, we were doing the final few miles to our lodge when we spotted her again, having walked towards us from the motel.
So we all walked together. Brookside Lodge was a real old-school establishment instead of the soulless generic brands that have taken so much of America and beyond. The attached restaurant had also come highly recommended, confirming the theory that more than half of the landmarks in thru-hiking tend trip be culinary rather than geographic.
Over dinner we revised our somewhat ambitious original schedule, which has been geared around us going up and over Mt Katahdin before Frodo returned to San Diego, to save her from some unnecessary worrying about us.
That was good by me. Aging bodies need and deserve time to adjust to the physical requirements of thru-hiking. With five months at our disposal, we have time to ease into this.
IAT lesson of the day: Aroostock potatoes are as good as everyone says, but it was Frodo rather than Scout or me who cleaned their plate first. ""And I'm not hiking"" she added. She didn't yet know that this was the first time on this trip that I'd had enough energy to actually finish my dinner before falling asleep.","Blue Moose restaurant

And with that the woman on a quad bike from a nearby farm handed me a bag filled with crisp juicy apples and chocolates.

She knew that the IAT used the otherwise nondescript rural thoroughfare that passed her farm. After all, there's no other reason why hikers would walk this way when there are so many other cool places to walk in Maine.

""Thanks!"" I replied and said she was a very welcome trail angel on this otherwise dreary stretch. 

About five months earlier this year I'd skipped a 30km section of the Israel Trail because it crossed a hot desert plain where the IDF tank divisions trained. The trail was a meritless jeep track next to a highway, but that wasn't any different to this and I was wondering whether it was just the factor that the IAT/AT was a longer trail that meant I wasn't skipping this.

Little moments of kindness like this helped.

That wasn't to say this road was wholly meritless. I was surprised to encounter a series of horses and buggies driven by Amish or Amish-like religious adherents who eschewed modern technology.

But the first six miles or so had been on a fairly busy road featuring a sloping verge that made it easier to walk on the tarmac itself, although that came at a cost to our feet.

Just after the town of Smyrna Mills, which looked like an exaggerated parody of the pleasant New England town, I was grateful to turn onto the far less trafficked Moro Road, which ran dead straight westwards as befitted its alternative name of Town Line Road.

Scout was a fan of early starts and had headed away about 20 minutes earlier. He was still ahead of me when our trail angel spotted him, collected her bag of goodies and emerged on to the road just as I was walking by.

When I finally caught up with him, I was able to say that I came bearing gifts. He certainly seemed surprised when I handed him a cold crisp apple.

Our finishing point for the day -- where we'd been told by Cheryl and Kirk about some ATV trails avoided an even worse road walk along on Route 11, a busy logging road -- was barely one third of a mile ahead. 

With even better timing, Frodo arrived a few minutes later to shuttle us to Mt Chase Lodge, an upmarket resort on Upper Shin Pond which was very IAT friendly. Her car support had allowed us to slackpack, making this section somewhat less taxing.

The lodge was a little outside my usual budget but was a plush option, with comfortable beds and fantastic food.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567422,"The single best bit of trail beta that IAT stalwarts Cheryl and Kirk gave us when we met for breakfast just as we were starting off this hike was about the presence of an ATV route that got us off sealed roads today.

After the last two days of road walking, this could scarcely have been better timed and we sent a thank you in their direction as we turned off Moro Road and headed down an old logging road.

We sent a second expression of gratitude when we saw what Route 11, the busy road that would otherwise have been our destiny, was like: lots of traffic and very narrow shoulders.

Scout had had a taste of the potential pitfalls the day before, when he was walking -- sensibly -- against the flow of traffic but couldn't anticipate a car in the other direction passing within a foot or so of him as it overtook a truck. We were glad to instead face nothing worse than the bad spelling on some of the ATV trail markers. 

Once we'd crossed over Route 11, we were even happier to see that the onward route featured IAT markers.

At the Mt Chase turnoff the eventual goal is for the trail to head over the top then drop down to Shin Pond directly, but landowner opposition was standing in the way of that plan, so instead we headed south and around the mountain.

For all the greater appeal of walking on ATV roads compared to the highway, it was still a variation on road walking and these were miles to be tallied rather than necessarily savoured.

As we were in the midst of a countdown towards an ice cream at Shin Pond and then reuniting with Frodo, we were boosted by a snowmobiler's sign announcing that the village was just four miles away.

We were getting pretty good at judging distance by now and it seemed a little too good to be true so we weren't surprised when the next one announced it was five miles, which was closer to our own estimate.

This process of optimistic, then realistic mileages continued almost until we followed a snowmobile trail down to a general store.

Soon we were reunited with Frodo and then we were back in the welcoming enclave of the Mt Chase Lodge for yet more sumptuous food and wine in the company of AT alumni. And we're 17 miles closer to the end of the road walking.

IAT lesson of the day: We'd been salivating at the prospect of an ice cream at the general store in Shin Pond but when we arrived they said they were out. We must have looked so downcast that the shopkeeper did a special search and found two ice creams at the bottom of the freezer that were of such ragged appearance that she gave them to us for free.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567427,"Bugs. Really bad bugs and a crappy road walk on a paved road.

About the only thing to be said in favour of the hiking part of today is it's the fastest time I've done 16 miles since my running days. In truth, the less said the better. 

Instead the interesting factors of the day were before and after the hiking part. 

We began in the pleasant enclaves of the Mt Chase Lodge, with another extravagantly awesome breakfast provided by our former thru-hiking hosts, Lindsay and Mike. It was the embodiment of an upmarket lodge, aimed at city people wanting a luxurious retreat in the woods.

The day ended at Matagamon Wilderness Camp, the polar opposite but equally nice and welcoming. 

When I rocked into the restaurant after my meritless 16-mile roadwalk, it was like stepping into a different country.

Their clientele were, like us, hikers -- but they only hiked to be able to shoot something rather than for wooly notions of recreational enjoyment or the beauty of the trail. And, in truth, if there was an option to take an ATV or a 4x4, they'd do that instead. 

I was the only person not dressed in camo, and the only one not talking some variation on rifle calibre or hunting strategy. The TV was blaring away in the background with a variety of shows ranging from actual hunting to a Survivor-type show in which shooting skills were what led to people being eliminated (not in that way).

All around me in the restaurant were the stuffed remnants of previous hunts in the form of bears, moose and a variety of other species down to a scrawny mini-weasel hanging from a moose's antler. 

The only other decorations on the walls were shots of hunters with dead animals and a sign saying that they believed in saying Merry Christmas, one nation under God, saluting our flag and thanking our troops and if I was offended by any of this, I was welcome to leave. I had a hunch that no matter how hard I looked, I was unlikely to find an ""I'm with her"" sticker on the walls here.

Perhaps the defining element was in the bathroom, where the reading material was a copy of Concealed Carry magazine.

But the nice bit was that this schism between our two stridently different versions of the outdoor experience didn't mean they were in any way unfriendly or intolerant of our what, to them, was our own bizarre version of it.

There was a family of Penobscot Indians there, who'd driven past me as I was road walking and commiserated about the bugs. To be fair, it would have been difficult to have disagreed with their view that roads are meant for driving, not walking, but they were kind enough not to point this out explicitly. 

Instead they were happy to tell me about the Penobscot nation lands around here and also to answer a few asinine city-slicker type questions about hunting, including discovering that they bait bears by providing doughnuts in a specific location for a month beforehand. 

Scout rocked up a while later after his own version of the road walking experience and shortly before it began spitting with rain. We discovered that while all the cabins were taken (by my new Penobscot friends, who clearly came here every year for decades -- no chance of them cancelling because of a bit of rain), there was a tent-cabin option which would save us from having to use our tents. 

We're also now 38 miles or so from Roaring Brook campground, from which we'll ascend Katahdin. This is also near the start of a section of actual trail, which means Frodo won't be able to slackpack us any more. 

But there's four or five more miles of road before a gate stops car access and we opted to make a head start by hiking it this afternoon, to put us ahead of the curve for the unknowns of our journey through the country between here and Baxter State Park.

This was indeed road walking but, being a logging road rather than a state highway, was of a different kind to the one we'd just done.

For a start, there was lot of wildlife around, including beaver pond which was so archetypal that it might have been out of a school textbook.

And we found a snake, although it had been too slow to get out of the way as Frodo drove through.

This five miles was nicer than most of the previous 50 or so, so we're hoping that will be a sign of things to come with this upcoming section of the IAT.

IAT fact of the day: While it's tempting to say there were no redeeming features on the road walk today, there was one in the form of an improved roadside spring, which featured the word ""Spring"" on a sign hanging from a tree above. But as we walked past the sign caught the wind and spun around, showing on the other side was written: ""Summer fall winter.""","Shin Pond
",Matagamon Wilderness Camp,"Jun 01, Thu",16
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567453,"That aphorism about being careful what you wish for came true for us today, when after 65 miles of walking roads the trail took us on what a nobo IATer described in a hut logbook as ""AT-type trail -- straight up a mountain"".

And I couldn't be happier.

Well, mostly happy. Not being on a road meant we couldn't go fast enough to keep ahead of the bugs so today was the first day I hiked in a headnet. And the rain came in late in the day, as we were trying to go up a hill on a trail nobody seems to have used since last fall.

But it's still so much better than road walking. 

We began with another session of the huntin' n fishin' icon that was the Matagamon Wilderness Camp for breakfast. When it comes to food that sticks to your ribs, I'd give the hunters the edge over us hikers.

Then Frodo drove us back to where we'd got to last night and farewelled us with her familiar advice to ""make wise decisions"". Since we have some mountainous terrain and a big river crossing ahead, the advice was a little more apposite than before.

The trail was fast at first, being on old logging -- or ""tote"", as it seems to be the local parlance -- roads. The Penobscot River seemed to be have been the original thoroughfare, being mostly slow water but with occasional pitches -- natural rock weirs -- around which there were portages. 

The sunny weather brought out the snakes too, and Scout actually stood on one without realising. 

""These snakes don't rattle!"" he exclaimed. ""I'm used to snakes that rattle.""

They're also non-venomous, although we didn't find that out until the following day from speaking to a Baxter State Park ranger. In the meantime, we decided it was wisest to avoid them, but even so both of us had near misses with this particularly dopey form of reptile. 

There were a few well-marked connector sections of trail -- more of a route, than actual trail -- to link together tote roads heading in the direction we wanted, and while mostly the way was open and easy, there were a few road sections where the regrowth was threatening to subsume the road back into the forest around.

Matt, a friend from Maine who I met while he was working as an academic in Abu Dhabi, had responded to an earlier post of mine about hiking in spring in his home state with a simple ""Maine > all"". I sent him back a photo of me in a rain poncho with a bug head net to say: ""Dear Dr Martin, we have assessed your hypothesis, ""Maine > all"", and have verified your findings, so long as the metrics used are (a) rain, (b) mud and (c) flying biting insects.""

But even with the rain, snakes and bugs, it was a fun day. The nature of it changed when we reached Lunksoos lean-to, which had a magnificent view of Katahdin but which also marked the end of the tote roads and the start of the first extensive section of trail on the IAT. 

It was pretty well marked but we needed to pay attention. We were grateful for the benefits of having two sets of eyes that were accustomed to the task of finding the route and spotting markers. 

The ""AT-type trail"" certainly proved true, even though I haven't hiked so much as a single foot on the AT and was unable to independently verify the claim other than comparing the route to friends' descriptions and previous trail journal accounts.

From the lean-to log books, it seemed like we were the first to come through here since November but the trail was remarkably good shape, with relatively few blowdowns. 

After wandering through the forest for a while, it went straight up some moss-covered granite ledges towards the summit of Lunksoos Mountain, where even the worst of the bugs was unable to prevent us stopping to marvel as the near and far views on offer.

The near was the ""lichen forest"", which was a true marvel. But the far was even more gobsmacking views all around to the places we'd already hiked from and to places we were about to go. One benefit of walking was we recognise every landmark along the way.

We'd aimed to stop at Deasey fire lookout, another mile or so further on, but hadn't got water at the stream near Lunksoos and so it seemed like we were going to have to go past the restored lookout, where we could have slept inside, and camp at the decrepit ranger station below, where there was a stream.

But then after a steep and slightly tricky descent from Lunksoos -- partly physically tricky, but also navigationally tricky because a landslide had taken out some crucial IAT markers -- we were in what would seem to have been on the crest of the ridge for the rest of the way but found ourselves at a tiny but sufficient stream, allowing us to fill our bottles again and sleep in the lookout.

The benefits of that became increasingly apparent as we scaled the ridge after the saddle and the heaviest rain of the day set in. Scout went to put his wet weather gear on but I tried to beat the worst of the rain by getting to the shelter double-quick. But after five minutes of this unwarranted optimism, I too succumbed to putting on rain gear, although in my case I used my rain jacket as a cape over the top of my pack rather than putting it on.

I was very grateful to see the signpost showing the lookout to be 0.1 miles away. Scout has a theory that nothing is more discouraging as a 0.1 mile marker, because it seems to cover everything from 50ft to half a mile. In this case, it was probably even closer than 0.1 miles and I was was glad to get in and out of the rain.

Scout joined me soon after and we looked across at Katahdin socked in with cloud, wondering what we're going to find there in -- maybe -- two days time. 

In the meantime, there's hardly a nicer sound than being inside and warm, listening to rain on the roof.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567454,"""The CDT is good training for this.""

Scout's pronouncement, as we hunted for the trail on the descent to the Wassataquoik River, was certainly correct. The Continental Divide Trail often punishes anyone who zones out for a while and stops paying attention to where they're going.

Like the CDT, the IAT's longest section of trail in Maine isn't really trail so much as a route. Although clearly better marked than before, with SIA/IAT signs augmenting what seemed to have been flagging with blue tape, staying on trail requires constant attention, particularly when the route suddenly veers off from one direction to another -- such as counterintuitively heading uphill after steadily going down.

So far as we could tell, we were the first ones through here since before winter. Even then, probably only 50 people use this route each year, which isn't quite enough to keep the tread obvious.

But this is where decades of experience in the outdoors, and particularly on remote trails, pays dividends. We later read a lean-to log book entry in which an AT Nobo completely lost the trail and never found it again, having to head back towards Katahdin. Fortunately we could tell within a few metres when the faint trail degraded to no trail and we had to start hunting for a trail marker or some blue flagging.

It was a challenge but give this to me any day over road walking.

Katahdin was still socked in when we left our fire lookout this morning, leaving us wondering if we were likely to get good weather on our summit day. Such were the shifting forecasts, often hour by hour, they'd become a standing joke and deemed to be about as accurate a predictor as our star signs.

The unspoken part of today was the single biggest obstacle on IAT: the ford on the Wassatquoik River. My suspicion is it'd be fine, since the snow melt was long since over and there'd be nothing more than nuisance rain since, but we were still a bit worried about the ""slippery bowling balls"" riverbed Cheryl and Kirk had told us about a week before.

I was grateful we hadn't had to push on to the fire warden's cottage the previous evening since it felt a lot more than the 0.9 and 0.8 miles the signs variously described the distance from the fire lookout and the camping was poor. The forest was still dripping on us as we headed past the station, where the main part of the roof had collapsed but it was interesting to note the porch seemed to still be watertight and usable as a kind of bivouac.

From there to where we picked up an old tote road again was when we had to be on the ball to follow the trail. With one excursion to see Earl's erratic -- a mammoth boulder dumped here by some retreating glacier -- we followed the tote road until we hit the river.

The first sight of it boosted my confidence in our ability to cross -- there was no colour in it from the recent rains and it seemed like we could cross it almost anywhere, although there might have been a short swim to get across the main channel. 

I suspected the ford site would be well chosen, and it was. The river bed there was even -- although it was as slippery as we'd been told -- and the water only ever got up to the ""octave line"" -- where it makes male hiker's singing voices a little sharper -- on me for a brief section in the middle of the stream. Scout, with his lankier legs, didn't go deeper than mid-thigh.

All this made us very grateful to reach the far bank, since it meant we didn't need to do the 6.5 mile unmaintained detour to an old logging bridge and it also ensured we'd get to Roaring Brook campsite that night and without feeling worn out ahead of what was going to be a tough day over Katahdin the next day.

From there, the route was all on old logging roads as we went past Wassatquoik lean-to and Katahdin Brook lean-to until we found ourselves on a substantial but gated road. It's best we don't elaborate on how to reach Baxter State Park, at which point we followed an old logging road to Katahdin Lake Wilderness Camp and then a substantial trail to Avalanche Field trail head.

It turned out Frodo had hiked in to meet us, found it both buggy and rainy, and had retreated to the trailhead. But she left the cutest note ever on a piece of bark advising us of this.

Soon we arrived at the road and could slackpack the 1.5 miles up to the park, where she'd booked the bunkhouse and provided a truly awesome meal for us. 

IAT fact of the day: After nine days shadowing us on the trail and making our lives inestimably easier, Frodo is about to head back to California for nearly a month. But she had a parting gift because if we climb tomorrow, she can take all our stuff to Millinocket, allowing us to do the ascent with just a day pack and not a full IAT/AT pack. Thanks Frodo.

The mountain runner looked a bit sheepish, but then added. ""I guess so, yeh.""

We were nearly at the top of the Knife Edge on the way to Baxter Peak on Mt Katahdin and the northern terminus of the AT when the hiker passing us said he'd run past us a few hours before as we ascended the Helon Taylor trail from Roaring Brook campground. I vaguely remembered him being one of a group of three who'd blown past us at a rate exponentially faster than we were going. 

But since he'd reached Roaring Brook, it turned out he'd then driven back around to Katahdin Stream campground, hiked up the mountain and set off on the Knife Edge a SECOND time, at which time he passed us.

""If it makes you feel any better,"" he added, seeing the look of dismay on my face, ""one of those guys is an Olympian.""

In a way, I should have expected this. Since we had already done about 143 miles since the border via the International Appalachian Trail (""Because 2189 miles isn't isn't long enough!"") and were approaching Katahdin from its most difficult trail (""Because the most difficult five miles on the AT isn't difficult enough!""), I was feeling just a tiny bit of superiority to those who'd merely hiked the 5.5 miles from Katahdin Stream campground. 

So of course the universe was going to provide some benchmarking to put me in my place. 

Even without that bit of hubris, we'd already been put in our place during the walk up the Helon Taylor trail. Quite apart from the physics of it -- we were sweating up a storm through the exertion despite it being pleasantly cool and perfect hiking temperature -- in the first hour we'd met a young woman heading back down who said she'd gone to the top for the sunrise but it had been socked in. She looked like she'd just walked to the corner shop, rather than someone who'd set off at 1am.

Then about half an hour after that, three mountain runners came leaping past -- including our lapper -- and then an hour after that, we encountered a Canadian guy called Dawson, who had quadriceps as big as my torso. 

He casually explained how he was ""going out and back"" -- IE doing our route, but twice -- as prep for some trail ultramarathons, one 80km and another 90km, on consecutive weekends in the near future.

If not for these three encounters, we might have been feeling good about getting to Pamola Peak, the subpeak of Katahdin where the Knife Edge starts, in three hours instead of the four I'd been expecting. The fact is we were still doing barely more than one mile an hour.

I'd been hesitant about going up in iffy weather, not wanting to do the knife edge in blowy or wet conditions or to have the famous Katahdin summit shot in the midst of cloud or worse. Scout was keen to reach the peak, regardless of cloud or blue skies, and one reason why I decided to go for it today on a forecast with a 40 per cent chance of showers was because the forecast was even worse for the next two days before having a day with a forecast merely similar to this one.

All this explains why after being socked in occasionally in cloud on the way up to Pamola Peak, I was very very happy to see blue skies emerging above.

We had a quick snack then tackled the descent to a col between Pamola and Chimney Peak. The trail beta was that the most technical part of the traverse was at the start for us, which was good by me, and we followed blue blazes down into scrambling rock on a route technical enough to make me have to think about my movements.

At the col, my suspicions that this was entirely avoidable were confirmed by the presence of a social trail back towards the Helon Taylor trail that bypassed the scrambling. 

There was no bypassing the scrambling ahead, though, and it was clear the blue blazes followed the obvious feasible line. There was nothing technically extreme but it was certainly not a place where one would like to slip.

After a short 30m pitch out of the col, the angle eased off and although there were some airy locations, the going was very straightforward and rarely required the use of hands. Still not a good place to slip, though, as the yawning gap off to our right made clear.

But this was absolutely my element: grippy and trustworthy granite on an alpine crest. The lack of howling winds allowed me to hop across from one rock to the next, avoiding the obvious loose ones, and simply enjoying a truly beautiful route. This is why no matter how decrepit my knees get and wheezy my lungs become, I could never give up the sport of mountaineering.

We ran into a couple of groups coming the other way and then just as we were heading towards Baxter Peak, our lapping mountain runner arrived to show us exactly where we belonged in the order of things.

We were on the summit soon after, adding a rock to the Baxter Peak cairn and then getting our photos taken at the famous AT northern terminus. Four other sobos arrived while we were there -- people we're likely to be leapfrogging for the next few months. After the past nine days, in which we'd seen just a handful of people on trail and none in the previous couple of days, it was both odd and energising to be amid the hiker buzz again.

I was still more than aware that the reputed ""toughest five miles on the AT"" lay between us and Katahdin Stream camp ground, even if the start across the Tablelands looked deceptively easy.

Even with that urge to get the descent underway, following white blazes instead of blue ones, we couldn't help stopping and chatting to others heading up, including four Nobos who were finishing their hike together after 99 days on the go. They truly had the thru-hiker ""look"".

The descent of the Hunt Trail was everything it'd been pegged: modestly technical, lots of descending on slabs of granite and the occasional reascent and circumnavigation to keep us on our toes. Our estimate of our pace meant we called to delay our shuttle from 4pm to 5pm, and it became obvious that even that was going to be running things close.

But the climb up Katahdin increases exponentially in steepness to the tablelands, and that worked in our favour by becoming slowly more reasonable as our tired limbs headed down. At 4.40pm, we were 1.1 miles from the campground so I booked it ahead to make sure the shuttle didn't leave without us. An hour later, we arrived in Millinockett and groaned as we made our way from the van up the stairs to the hostel.

We have a zero day tomorrow -- our first and long overdue, even if the universe had shown that in the grand scheme of things, we didn't achieve all that much today.

AT fact of the day: Scout and I had talked about when we'd see our first Nobos. He'd estimated June 19 and I'd pegged June 21, but not only did we meet Nobos within a mile of the summit but the first Nobo had been here a full four days earlier.","Roaring Brook campground

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568661,"Millinocket proved to be the perfect place for our first zero day, having an awesome diner, laundry facilities, a post office and wifi. What more could a hiker want?

We also had the chance meet some of the other hikers who we expect to be leapfrogging for the next five months.

The first one we encountered, however, cast a bit of a pall by explaining how some of his food had been stolen by fellow hikers while in the 100 mile wilderness, prompting him to have to backtrack to replenish his supplies

This was both hard to believe but also confirmed some of what we'd been told about how the AT really was entirely different to the PCT and CDT, with people who lived on the trail while pretending to be hikers, scam merchants who conned fellow hikers with invented hard luck stories and other variations on a general theme of dishonesty.

it was still difficult to believe hikers would steal what they know is another hiker's most valued consumable, although this was also in the nature of the mix of nobo and sobo hikers, with the former often running out of money towards the end of their hikes.

With Frodo's departure, we also had to return to usual levels of self sufficiency, including mailing stuff ahead instead of being met with all our excess gear, chauffeured to us by her in an act of unremitting generosity.

Even though our hiker hunger is yet to kick in, a fair portion of the day was set aside for eating, for which we had an enthusiastic participant in the form of Skippy John Joe, who was the third to complete the AT this year and was taking a few days off before hiking back to Georgia to complete the yoyo.

Along with Janine, a German hiker who initially looked at the rest of us with a mix of fear and concern, as if we were white slave traders, Scout and Skippy joined in for dinner.

We already knew that Millinocket was doing it hard, with the closure of the paper mill a few years before taking most of the town's jobs with it.

But the epigram about any change always being good for someone was demonstrated when our waitress revealed herself to be a recent Massachusetts import who had bought a nine bedroom house here on an established lot for $12,000. Not $120,000 -- $12,000.

AT fact of the day: The AT Hostel, where we stayed, is a fun establishment but not one for the taller hikers -- the ceiling of the attic rooms, where the 6ft1in Scout was originally going to stay, were low enough for me to graze my head and I'm a mere 5ft7in.","Millinocket

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569759,"Hikers! Hikers everywhere!
After our nine exceptionally quiet and isolated days on the IAT, the preponderance of other thru hikers around us today served as a reminder of how important the social aspect is to the enjoyment of our bizarre pursuit of thru-hiking.
We'd had a tiny taste of this on Katahdin and again on our zero day on Millinocket, at the AT Hostel, but today really brought it home when we rocked up to Hurd Brook lean to, found a bunch of other hikers in attendance and quickly were chatting as if we'd always known each other.
The infectious energy that comes from this had always been why I've particularly rated American hiking as being as much about the community as it is about the trails. Its absence on my Israel Trail hike earlier this year -- and even on the IAT -- was noticeable.
Skippy John Joe exemplified it in a different way when he'd explained how his nobo hike had been essentially alone -- he started in January -- which is why he ended up naming and animating all his pieces of gear, such as Phoebe foodbag and Pauline pole. He was aiming for his sobo yoyo to be much slower and more social.
We had a hint of it today when random newly-arrived hikers joined tables with us for breakfast at the AT Diner, purely based on the shared pursuit of thru hiking.
As we headed to Katahdin Stream campground with Ole Man, who ran the hostel, we farewelled three new hikers -- knowing what they were about to face -- and instead met two of yesterday's summiteers, Dot and Gazelle, who were setting off for the following section, the 100 mile wilderness.
Today was a bit like the first day at a new school, meeting lots of new people and making assessments about which ones are likely to be your friends and which ones you'd be best to avoid. It says a lot about the nature of thru-hikers that just about everyone was in the first category.
We already knew that the first section of trail was going to be the polar opposite of the Katahdin trail, and so it proved. The start of the AT was a pleasant romp on good trail past a series of picturesque forest scenes.
So picturesque, Scout said, that they ""could have been on a beer advert"", which is apparently the acme of outdoors scenery.
Gazelle romped past us and then another hiker, Frankenfoot, did too. 
""We're going to be the Bryson and Katz of sobo AT17,"" I thought to myself as they headed off in the distance.
There were plenty of distractions from this, including little and big Niagra falls and then the pleasant riverside walking on what had clearly once been a tote road back in logging times.
It was almost a surprise to realise we'd made it so quickly to Abol Bridge, the last tiny pocket of civilisation before the 100 mile wilderness. 
It was definitely a surprise to find the restaurant shut, since we'd been using it for motivation. The main store was open, however, and they explained that things didn't really get going until school holidays, which were due to start in about 10 days.
As we hiked on towards the wilderness, we encountered Frostbite, Gazelle and Dot heading back our way.
""It's the last ice cream for 100 miles,"" we were told in response to our quizzical looks. We had to admit that was unassailable thru-hiker logic.
We then entered the woods and soon encountered a sign announcing the start of the 100 mile wilderness and describing the lack of facilities in drastic terms for anyone foolish enough to carry less than 10 days of food.
""Well, I'm carrying two and a half days of food,"" quipped Scout. 
A little over an hour later we arrived at our first official AT lean to, at Hurd Brook, and found quite a tally of hikers present. These including the talkative Hard Drive, who we'd last seen on the summit of Katahdin, and a host of other new faces.
Partly because the start of the day was so easy, several of us headed on. Scout and I stopped at the awesome Rainbow Ledges, where we found a pair of magnificent campsites, complete with a grandstand view of Katahdin.
Frankenfoot, Dot and Frostbite kicked on to a lakeside campsite but I'm still feeling the effects of Katahdin and was happy to call it early.
And it would be difficult to beat this campsite. What could make this even better? Oh yeah, Frankenfoot had carried in from Abol Bridge a six pack of a local microbrew and had generously offered me one.
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: Our first real AT lean to was not one that was very amenable to sleeping. Quite apart from the presence of a hyper squirrel, the floor was of the so-called baseball bat kind, made up of long round logs rather than the usual flat planking.","Katahdin Stream camp ground
",Rainbow Ledges,"Jun 06, Tue",15.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568663,"When I pulled out of camp an hour after Scout, the last thing I expected to encounter was to find him walking steadily towards me on the AT.

I figured he must have left something behind by mistake, but then he said: ""RT, did you get turned around?""

A skill I'd dearly love to acquire would be the ability to sleep in for an hour and magically appear ahead of Scout. Unfortunately the answer was somewhat more prosaic: as he negotiated his way past a blowdown, he'd got turned around, found the white blazes again and, thanks to the less-than-memorable terrain, didn't realise he was heading north.

It took a little while for reality to sink in. It seems nobody has bothered to tell the AT that we're experienced hikers, each with 10,000+ miles under our calloused feet.

But after an initial moment of embarrassment and wounded pride, he was able to see the obvious humour in the situation and we spent the next hour each recalling previous navigational blunders that occurred due to zoning out and not paying due attention to the task at hand. The most egregious examples, I was slightly embarrassed to admit, tended to be mine.

The irony, of course, was that this was the first time we'd taken advantage of the easier navigation on the AT to indulge our different body clocks. 

Unlike the IAT, where two sets of eyes and a collective navigational consciousness was required on the trail sections, here Scout could leave early and I'd use my slightly faster pace to cancel out my natural morning indolence and catch him in mid morning.

Maybe it'll work better tomorrow...

Once we'd reached new ground for Scout, it only took a minute or so to emerge on Rainbow Lake, the shore of which we followed for much of the rest of the morning. It was easy travel.

So far, we suspected the AT was being kind to us, with relatively easy trail compared to some of the horror stories we'd heard about PUDs (pointless ups and downs) and other forms of unnecessary suffering.

As is the wont of the way the mind wanders on long trails, I figured I'd start giving each day a Smeagol/Gollum Index score, based on which of the two personalities of the Lord of The Rings character seemed to be ascendent on the trail crew's route.

For the time being it was Smeagol (""We likes the hikers, they are our friends"") rather than Gollum (""Nasty hikerses must be punished""), but we suspected this was likely to change soon.

The LOTR theme underway in my head made the sylvan and somewhat Hobbit-like setting of the Rainbow Stream lean to seem particularly appropriate. It was the nicest one we'd seen yet, sited beside a series of picturesque waterfalls as the steam forced its way down between moss-covered crags.

Unfortunately this loveliness seemed to be commensurate with its mousiness, based on the number of mouse-proof pack strings from the roof and from the series of rodent-themed horror stories in the register.

We opted for lunch then headed on. Since we're still less than two weeks into this hike and because we're in what's regarded as the toughest of the 14 states traversed by the AT, I've been keen for a leisurely pace as our bodies adjust back to hiking life. If we can survive Maine and the Whites intact, my theory goes, that's the point when one might start considering increasing the mileage.

Scout seems to lack my, um, undoubted talent for preservational indolence and wants to push the miles now. 

Normally I would have been in favor of a 16-mile day, stopping on Nesantabunt Mountain, rather than pushing on to the lean to a couple of miles further.

But two factors altered my stance. One was the beautiful blue-sky day of the kind we'd been dreaming of since we set off from Fort Fairfield. And the other is that tomorrow we're scheduled to reach White House Landing, a business just a short boat ride from the trail that serves hikers beer and burgers. It's also where we've sent our resupply box for the second part of the 100 mile wilderness.

Going further today and an early start tomorrow -- both usually things that set Scout's soul soaring but leave me with a sense of dread -- make sense because we can have more time to enjoy what is likely to be one of the most salubrious experiences in the wilderness.

Having thus determined that beer and burgers out-trumped indolence in my internal hierarchy of values, we set off up Pollywog Stream to Crescent Lake. Heading up Nesantabunt Mountain, we then quickly found that the trail designer turned from Smeagol to Gollum.

Later on this hike I may come to reassess these words but the trail seemed deliberately onerous in entirely avoidable ways. Or maybe it was just the afternoon and my energy levels were dipping?

But at least it was spectacular, with great views over the lake and back to every AT hiker's favourite mountain.

The far side is when Gollum really reigned supreme, with the trail descending via a series of unexpected but welcome springs but then going back up for no apparent reason other than to ""punish the nasty hikerses"".

Apart from the Guthook app, Scout had an official AT map that featured gradients. These had alarmed us for having a descent similar only to Katahdin but failed to include these bonus metres of height gain. Together with an estimated distance that proved to be about 25 per cent short, we were a pair of tired hikers who arrived at the lean to after a day with a Smeagol-Gollum ratio of about 85:15, work the effect heightened by the Gollum bit being at the end of the day.

Fortunately, we were revived somewhat by a fun crew who were already in attendance. Most of the others camping nearby seemed to range from the standoffish to the walking dead but these were five apparently lifelong friends who were hiking in support of one of them, Betsy, who was aiming to do a thru hike.

She'd been assessing various attempted trail names but then adopted Scout's suggestion of Sheriff, in light of her posse.

AT fact of the day: After today's navigational snafu, our respect for the trail has increased a little. It turns out this isn't just a walk in the woods.","Rainbow Ledges

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568665,"The 100 mile wilderness was a name we had time to contemplate as we supped cold beers while waiting for our burgers and pizzas to be cooked.

After three days and about one third of the way through the ""wilderness"", we've already crossed three roads and are due to cross many more, as well as a railroad, before we're back in the non-wilderness. Even before arriving at the sybaritic enclave of White House Landing, just across Pemadumcook Lake from the trail, we'd wondered if the wilderness tag was merely a comparative one based on the rest of the trail.

On the PCT, being designated a wilderness prevented any kind of mechanical assistance, be it mountain bikes or even a chainsaw for trail crews clearing blowdowns. Back in New Zealand, the definition of wilderness was even tougher yet, with helicopters being unable to land or sometimes even fly over the terrain and with no improvements such as huts or bridges allowed.

My tongue-in-cheek reference to ""Embrace the civility"" -- a play on the CDT's unofficial motto of ""Embrace the brutality"" -- turns out to have more than a bit of truth to it.

White House Landing has a storied history on the AT, involving a mile long spur trail that once led to a jetty fitted with an air horn, which was used to summon a boat to take hikers the short journey to this former logging camp.

Now the ""wilderness"" has good enough cellphone reception that the boat can be summoned from only half a mile from the trail. Even better, our visit meant we could send a food package to collect here so our packs never had to be weighed down with more than four days of food.

We were inestimably grateful.

So too were Jude, Katbird and Trail, three other hikers who we'd met when searching for the trail when it was obscured by some blowdowns -- the closest today's trail came to being on the wrong end of the Smeagol-Gollum Index. 

While we found the trail, we filled them in on White House Landing -- then barely 45 minute's walk away, but they'd never heard of it -- and they opted to join us.

They were a fun group and we were later joined by three young nobos -- Princess Leia, Spice Girl and Ramses -- on the last couple of days of their epic hike.

We arrived just in time for lunch, had an indolent afternoon until it was time for dinner and now we're contemplating the sunset from our waterfront cabin, complete with a tiny beach. Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We're lucky to be here because White House Landing was closed for some years while the owners opted for stability for their high school aged son. They're building their business back up again but based on how much we've enjoyed it, that shouldn't be a problem.","Hadleigh Stream lean to
",White House Landing,"Jun 08, Thu",7.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568667,"""You saw a MOOSE?!""
Alpine, a skeletally-thin young nobo, was flabbergasted when we casually mentioned that a few minutes earlier, a moose had wandered onto the trail barely 30ft in front of us.
""I've been walking in moose shit for months and I still haven't seen one.""
It seemed unfair to mention to him that we'd actually seen three moose -- one on the IAT, one in the odd 12-mile bit of Baxter State Park between the official southern terminus of the IAT and the official northern terminus of the AT on Mt Katahdin, and now one in the 100 mile wilderness.
With barely three days left before he was due to summit Katahdin, Alpine's chances of seeing his moose seemed unlikely.
So far, the nobos we'd met had mostly defied the stereotype of speed-crazed antisocial solo hikers who saw Katahdin as something to be reached and dispensed with as quickly as possible.
There were plenty of speed demons, but the group of hikers we met on or summit day, who were completing their goal of a 100-day thru hike with a day to spare, had seemed to be a close-knit team. 
Even Spice Girl, Princess Leia and Ramses -- with whom Alpine had hiked for weeks, until he opted to slow down as the end neared -- had taken time off from their onerous four-month schedule to enjoy the delights of White House Landing.
Alpine, we discovered, had started his hike on January 1. More than six mooseless months later, he said he'd seen every single other type of creature out here, other than the obvious. He'd now booked his flight home and was already planning to join the military once he was done.
We wished him luck with his moose quest, congratulated him on his upcoming hike completion and then we headed off in our respective directions.
The morning so far had gone exceedingly well, in part because of the White House Landing breakfast. This featured all the usual artery-clogging favourites, with the addition of all-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes.
The sumptuous breakfast came at the cost of a late start -- 8.45am -- since we gave space in the first of three boat journeys to the nobo crew since they wanted to reach Katahdin Stream camp ground that day.
Then within an hour we'd seen our moose, disappointed Alpine with the news and then met yet another skeletally-thin young nobo named Rooster.
The forecast has been for a day of scattered showers but it was also the easiest walking of the entire AT so far. This was not just 100 per cent Smeagol on my Smeagol-Gollum Index but Smeagol-on-a-first-date pleasant.
There was plenty of the long green tunnel, but we were also regularly entertained by views of the lake, short sections of golden sand beaches and even views of Katahdin, still disappointingly close after four days of hiking.
We had lunch at Antlers camp ground, sited on a peninsula jutting into the lake which would have made a perfect campsite had we been on a different schedule.
We even managed to have a mini White House Landing reunion when Katbird and Trail arrived as we were having an early lunch with Elwood. 
For neophyte hikers, they were carrying waaaaaaaaay too much but had been doing the schedule absolutely right, hiking only a handful of miles a day and ensuring they were really enjoying themselves. When we corrupted them into coming to White House Landing, it gave them a daily mileages tally of just two miles -- and they were fine with that. I hoped to meet them again down the trail when they'd transformed unwittingly into uber hikers.
Even when the rain began to come in around mid afternoon, the trail was still enjoyable. 
At Cooper Brook Falls lean to -- in one of the trail's best locations yet, next to a cascade that ended in what was clearly an awesome swimming hole -- Scout and I tempted and/or taunted the weather gods by putting away the umbrellas we'd been using until then. 
The response was predictable: within a minute of Scout leaving the lean to, thunder echoed through the valley and the skies opened. I opted to stay for a few more minutes until the worst of the initial downpour had passed before donning Poncho version 2.0, which was adapted from the $5 one I'd bought at the IAT trailside WalMart in Houlton more than a week ago
The trail was clearly a former bridle path or some other kind of improved trail, being far better engineered and consistently graded than the rocks, roots and mud to which we'd become accustomed. Smeagol was clearly having a good day and Gollum was nowhere to be seen.
By the time we reached Crawford Pond, the rain had stopped and after crossing the outflow via what seemed like the most optimistic beaver dam in the history of beavers, I found Scout searching for potential campsites near the road crossing.
We eventually found something workable in the waterfront forest, although definitely deficient in comparison to the campsites I'd seen earlier on the pond's sandy beach, where camping was at least nominally banned.
AT fact of the day: We might be content with our mileage today but benchmarking came in the form of the superfit nobo trio of Spice Girl, Princess Leia and Ramses, who hiked 22 miles through this terrain to reach White House Landing by 12.30pm...","White House Landing
",Crawford Pond,"Jun 09, Fri",17.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568668,"Today we got to meet Smeagol and Gollum.
Or at least we got to meet the head of the Maine Appalachian Trail Club and a coterie of volunteers as they were hauling in, by hand, the components of the new wooden privy for the Logan Brook lean to.
The first sign of this came as I slowly ground my way up the ridge towards the lean to and saw someone ahead of me carrying nothing but four lengths of sawn timber.
A couple of minutes later I met the rest of the MATC work crew as they were having lunch, at which point I was greeted with: ""Rolling Thunder, would you like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?""
D6, the crew leader and also the head of the MATC, had been at Scout's book talk in Portland a couple of weeks earlier. He also, I can now attest, makes a mean PB&J.
And a mean PB&J deserves some reward, which is why I ended up hiking the rest of the way to the lean to* with a six-foot beam of timber over one shoulder to save them a load.
(* Full disclosure: it was 0.4 of a mile)
All this was a pleasant interlude to what was the most challenging climb since entering the 100 mile wilderness, although many of the nobo entries in the lean to registers suggested this was just the tiniest taste of what the next 200+ miles was going to be like.
Climbing was the order of the day, beginning with Little Boardman Mountain from our sketchy campsites near Crawford Pond, but it was only 700ft or so from the road to the summit.
That made it a mere tiddler in the scheme of the AT and the next few miles to the next lean to were generally cruisey on mostly flat ground. I crossed paths with yet another nobo thru-hiker, Rabbit, whose lack of interest in talking compared to clocking up miles conformed with the usual reputation for those way at the front of the herd and contrasted with the demeanour of most of those we'd encountered so far.
The only impediment of the morning was the crossing of the East Branch of the Pleasant River. The river might be pleasant but the crossing wasn't, being in that in-between zone where getting across with dry feet via a dodgy log crossing was just about feasible but at the risk of a dunking and possibly worse than accepting the pessimistic option and simply wading through the thigh-deep water between slippery boulders. Having two hiking poles made all the difference to its feasibility for me.
Once the trail began to climb, it was clear that Gollum had been in charge because it headed straight up with a directness that left me gasping and in low-gear truck mode. But after punishing the ""nasty hikerses"" sufficiently, he apparently handed over control to Smeagol, at which point the trail began traversing access the slope at a far more pleasant grade.
This was where I met the trail crew, enjoyed the PB&J sandwich, carried the beam for the new privy and in time reached the lean to, where Scout was enjoying his lunch.
We were then halfway up White Cap, the biggest climb since Katahdin and a particular landmark for nobos because the grandstand view it provided for the final 73 miles of their hike.
Eskimo and his mother, Coach, joined us at the lean to. She was hoping to get to Vermont before her 30 day holiday was up and from the pace at which they hauled up White Cap after lunch was any indication, that ambitious goal might just be feasible. Eskimo had already hiked the first 170 miles of the AT northbound to get in shape before tackling these unforgiving Maine hills.
Scout, of course, forged ahead and I slowly ground up at the back of the pack, which gave me plenty of time to marvel at the enormous amount of work that the MATC must have put into creating hundreds of metres of stone staircases that headed straight up the mountain.
At least this brought us to the tree line with brutal efficiency, where the views combined with clear blue skies to be everything they'd been touted to be and it was gratifying for Katahdin to finally begin to seem more distant than in our previous few sightings. The steady breeze even keep the black flies and mosquitoes at bay, in stark contrast to the previous few days.
From there, the trail followed the roller coaster ridge over a series of mountains, mostly on Smeagol trails but with a Gollum section thrown in every now and then to keep us on our toes.
The miles cruised by, thanks in large part to Scout's reminiscences about his boy scout summer camp days on Catalina island. This achieved two things: (a) allowing me to keep up by occasionally asking one- or two-word questions that would elicit long tales from him about youthful hijinks and also (b) proving incontravertibly his belief in the essential goodness of people.
We arrived at Sydney Tapper campsite to find sobos such as Bird and Toad, whose gentler pace meant we hadn't met them before. Eskimo and Coach opted to stop there but we camelled up on water from a spring just down the hill and took it another 1.8 miles to the next lean to.
I'm not sure exactly how this works but the end of the day is when we desperately seek Smeagol trail but seem disproportionately likely to get Gollum trail instead.
The first few hundred metres were bucolic, as if this was former farmland rather than intermittently-logged forests. Then we could almost see Gollum push Smeagol to one side and say: ""I got this.""
The trail went straight up the side of a hill in a manner that had Scout asking: ""Am I even on trail here?""
The fact that there was a white blaze next to his hip showed both that the AT does indeed go this way and also hinted at how steep this was. But at least the climbs were short as we headed over every possible knoll, at the final one of which there letter K was painted onto the rock with an arrow, giving nobos their momentous first sight of the trail's northern terminus.
The trail down to the shelter took a disproportionately long time and we arrived to find the familiar faces of Sheriff, Spiffy, Lindsay, Nine and Ryan already in situ. Before we'd managed to finish cooking, we'd been overtaken by darkness -- this was a long and draining day in which we'd only managed fewer than 15 miles.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568669,"""I see the hand of Gollum at work here!""

I'd been slogging up Chairback Mountain on a baking hot day and was literally dripping with sweat from every piece of clothing I wore when I saw what seemed to be the obvious steep but feasible ridge leading up to the summit.

Just to the left was a series of cliffs that are presumably the source of the peak's name. Then with a sinking feeling that any AT hiker will recognise, I realised the truth: the trail went up the cliff.

Spiffy and Lindsay were already working their way up through boulders that were as big as washing machines. Shortly before, I'd expounded to them my theory of the Smeagol-Gollum Index, in which the trail designers vacillated between the personalities of Smeagol, who ""likes hikerses"", and Gollum, who wanted to ""punish nasty hikerses"".

The true irony was that maybe half an hour before, we'd meet Ole Sloggy, the MATC volunteer who looked after this short section of trail, as he walked down from his third maintenance visit this year. 

He was with two women who seemed to be his wife and child. More importantly, he pulled out three crisp juicy apples and offered them to me. Thanks!

And with that they disappeared down the trail, not even hinting at what lay ahead.

In truth this short section of trail was not all that bad but came after a gruelling climb in what was a rare early June heat wave. Given the high probability of endless rain, it seemed churlish to complain about a sunny blue-sky day but this kicked my ass.

I'd stopped at the turnoff to East Chairback Pond for 45 minutes to recover from the heat, which is where Spiffy and Lindsay caught up and were introduced to the concept of the Smeagol-Gollum Index, then 20 minutes later I'd run into Ole Sloggy. Just as I was about to carry the apples to surprise Spiffy and Lindsay at the lean to just past the summit, they arrived and I was able to get all the credit for sharing trail magic without having to carry any extra weight. Win!

All this explained why I arrived at the lean to an hour after Scout, who had also been given three apples from Ole Sloggy. 

Sheriff arrived soon after and happily received an apple from Scout's stash, grateful but wondering why Ole Sloggy had left her appleless as they passed.

My right knee -- injured in a football match between Old Bailey and Daily Mirror journalists in London 27 years earlier, then mercilessly abused in mountaineering and ski touring expeditions in the decades since -- had swollen a little from the exertion of the past couple of days so I advised Scout that his goal of covering 36 miles over two days to get into Monson was looking overly ambitious.

Rule #1 of thru hiking is to listen to your body, and both my body and the rational side of my brain were saying that we should wait for a month or so before even thinking about pushing miles, especially since we were in the longest section of the most arduous state on the entire trail.

But I also know that Scout was feeling the need for speed, despite having already done two thru hikes and knowing of the rookie error of going out too hard and too fast in the early stages of a five month trail. I suggested he head along without me and he agreed. 

Sheriff made it clear she was going no further that day, but then she was also carrying 10 days of food because she was aiming to go to Rangely -- about 140 tough trail miles away -- before resupplying or having a zero day.

Once the heat of the day had moderated a little, Spiffy, Lindsay and I headed on, aiming to clock a few miles before finding a camping site. 

My usual style when I don't know if there'll be camping is to hike until an hour before dark -- about 7.30pm or so, this far north and close to the solstice -- then take the first good site I encountered after that. It took until just before 8pm before I found an adequate place just on the western edge of the imaginatively-named Fourth Mountain, after having just crossed Third Mountain.

AT fact of the day: So far the black flies have been merely annoying rather than infuriating but they were at their worst at dusk, to the point where they were bouncing off the inside of my tent fly so friendly that I initially thought it was starting to drizzle outside.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568679,"I think my hiker hunger has finally kicked in, based on the scarily small amount of food I have left and just over a day from the end of the famed 100 mile wilderness.

Because last night was a dry camp, I hadn't cooked and the consequence was I was feeling a little flat today due to the cumulative effects of several tough days and the lack of a reinvigorating big meal. Instead I'd made do last night with my stash of gummy bears.

It didn't help that I pushed back the first food break for three hours, until I'd climbed and then descended Barren Mountain and reached Long Pond Stream lean to. 

The good news was the view from the ruined fire observation tower just before the descent showed far smaller peaks ahead. The bad news was I was equally sure Gollum would rise to the challenge and find a painful path through the terrain ahead.

The decision to go slower rather than trying to get to Monson was certainly vindicated because I felt like I was running on fumes for most of the day, even though the trail seemed, thankfully, to be far more often designed by Smeagol than Gollum.

Part of it too was the lack of others on my vicinity. Apart from two nobo section hikers, who were going from Monson to Katahdin, I found myself in a hiker bubble where there were people ahead of me and behind me but our paces meant I walked alone virtually all day.

This trend wasn't broken until after crossing the railroad line (see: 100 mile ""wilderness"") at which point I met a sobo couple, Rachel and Travis, who'd taken nine days to get through from Katahdin Stream camp ground. 

Almost everyone around me takes of their shoes for steam crossings, either to keep their socks dry or to use the aqua sandals they've been carrying.

As I did today's third unavoidable ford, I couldn't help thinking it was better to use the kiwi method of just getting used to wet feet and wading straight through any crossing.

Once again, I used the ""first decent campsite after 7.30pm"" rule and, as with the previous evening, it took until nearly 8pm for one to present itself.

I'm now almost exactly five miles out from the road and I can hear a mix of car noise and whining mosquitoes as I'm falling asleep. I'm nearly done, in many senses of the word.

AT fact of the day: AT sobo is tough! As I was clambering straight up yet another pile of steep rocks and roots, I remember thinking that if the Appalachian Trail featured PCT switchbacks, it would be 4,000 miles long.","Fourth Mountain

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568680,"In California's Sierra mountains, there's a place called Vermilion Valley Resort that's used as a resupply point by thru-hikers on the 212-mile John Muir Trail and also by those on the 2650-mile Pacific Crest Trail.
After years of observing hikers, VVR's owner, Jim, said he'd found a foolproof way to tell them apart.
""JMT hikers will wash and then eat when they arrive,"" he explained. ""But PCT hikers will eat and then wash.""
After getting going today at an ungodly hour of 5.40am and crushing the five miles to the road, I reached Monson and immediately went to eat rather than wash.
Part of the reason was that my hitch hike down from the pass -- with a kindly retired couple from Maine, to whom I apologised profusely and repeatedly for my rank aroma -- dropped me of at Pete's Place, an awesome old school diner, rather than Shaw's hiker hostel.
By that point my food bag was down to three energy bars and about half a dinner -- far less of a buffer than I'd normally like.
At Pete's, I ordered a huge breakfast then used the WiFi to catch up with seven days of the being wholly off the grid in terms of the outside world. 
Amid the usual buzzes and beeps of updating message systems of various kinds, I was grateful to learn that while I was pleasantly incommunicado, no new dramas had befallen those I care about .
As I slowly waddled my way up to Shaw's afterwards, it was nice to reacquaint myself with the familiar faces of those I'd seen in the wilderness and also go through the always slightly unsettling process of meeting in person those whose names I'd been following in the lean to registers for more than 100 miles.
Scout was there too, having boogied to get in the previous evening. A somewhat inevitable conversation followed acknowledging the incompatibility of our respective hiking aspirations for this trail. It was nice to have it out in the open.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569401,"Shaman is exactly the kind of hiker I expected to find on the AT.

With a flowing ginger beard, wooden staffs as trekking poles, an enormous external frame pack, the kind of heavy insulated coat one would expect to find in an Alaskan truckers' bar, and boots named, respectively, ""Spite"" and ""Stubbornness"", he's like a relic from a bygone age.

But he's 29, he's near the front of the pack of nobo hikers and his perpetual huge smile and endless series of improbable but hilarious anecdotes shows he's having the time of his life.

It's encounters like these that explain why people reserve a special affection for the AT, despite the existence of more beautiful and less physically taxing trails elsewhere.

Pepa, another of the volunteers helping Scout and Frodo shepherd 900 hikers onto the PCT this year, had done the AT and the PCT, and had been due to begin the CDT. He likened comparing each trail's merits to comparing one's children, and took particular umbrage when I then suggested the AT was the red-headed stepchild of long distance American trails.

However we agreed on the notion that the AT was the most social of the trails, and today bore that out.

It took a matter of moments to turn my nominal plan to hike out this afternoon into a full zero day in Monson. Part of that was extra recovery time after the 100 mile wilderness but I also faced a daunting number of jobs I had to complete, including updating this journal but also assessing for my father whether the professional editor he'd hired to go over his memoirs has done an adequate job.

In between all these I also had time to hang out with hikers both known and, like Shaman, new to me.

Every hour or two through the day another familiar face would turn up at Shaw's hiker hostel.

I was particular happy to see our White House Landing companions Katbird and Trail, and I joked about how they'd clearly found their trail legs. However it turned out they'd accepted the offer of a lift from a local they met about 30 miles from the end of the wilderness and were talking about quitting. Katbird was loving the hiking life but Trail admitted he ""wasn't quite feeling it"".

In a way I wasn't surprised. Starting at Katahdin and then doing the trail's longest wilderness section in the most difficult and physically arduous state was a really tough start to any hike. If I'd suspected the next five months were going to be exactly like the last week, I might have been tempted to quit as well.

I suggested instead they head to easier hiking somewhere on the AT out of New England before opting to return home to Florida. I hope they find their motivation once more because they'd mostly done everything right and seemed to have been really enjoying themselves out here.

Shaw's is run by the daughter and son in law of Ole Man, who ran the equivalent lodge in Millinocket. But Poet and Hippy Chick, who'd hiked the AT, have found the way to add that mysterious extra something that turns a good hostel into a great one.

It's been really nice to wrap myself in the hiking community once more after a couple of days of mostly hiking and camping alone. Without the community, this hike would be an absolutely different -- and far less enjoyable -- experience.

AT fact of the day: Shaman is living proof that you can break virtually every rule of the prevailing ultralightweight ethos and still have a fun and successful thru hike.","Monson
",Monson,"Jun 14, Wed",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569402,"Rapunzel looked perplexed as we exited Poet's car after the short drive from Monson: ""Where's the trail go?""

""This is the AT,"" I replied, gesturing towards where the trail went directly up the embankment. ""It goes straight up. Or straight down.""

And sure enough, contrary beast that the AT is, the trail then immediately disproved my theory by going along for the rest of the day rather than up or down.

Today's short tally of miles turned out to be among the least typically AT we'd seen for some time. Quite the opposite: by choosing a pragmatic route that traversed a series of gentle hills and then following a river upstream, with a series of short climbs to get around where the water bluffed up against our side of the valley, the day had a very kiwi feel to it.

The series of ankle- to knee-deep fords helped accentuate that impression too, although I noticed that I still seem to be in a tiny minority of those who simply plunge in rather than using the convoluted process of changing into either aqua sandals or taking one's socks off for the crossing.

The prosect of cruisy trail made it a little easier to escape the vortex of comfort that Poet and Hippy Chick had created at Shaw's Hiker Hostel. 

Our pace also reflected the way we'd been fortified with a breakfast that involved coffee, bacon, eggs, awesome home fries and with all-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes to finish. And hikers who have just done the 100 mile wilderness can eat a lot.

Chef, for example, had based his food on doing the wilderness in three days of 25, 25 then 50 miles. For him to not start before 10am was clearly putting him behind schedule.

Us lazy sobos had an easier schedule, since we only had 37 miles to get across in three days, although we also knew some bad weather was coming in.

That forecast prompted me to head on past the Horseshoe Canyon lean to at 10 miles and also continue past the exemplary campsite Pan, Tink, Boss and Sweets chose on the far side of a ford three miles on.

I banked two more easy miles and camped on a slightly manky site where a logging road crossed the steam and intersected with the AT.

With an eye on the incoming storm, I sited my tent out of the obvious dad drainage channels in case there ended up being a lot of rain. I was in my sleeping bag by 5pm and had a short snooze -- I've now crossed that hiker threshold where I sleep better in the woods than in town, even in my own room -- before the usual evening chores of cooking.

AT fact of the day: This trail can be pleasant when it chooses to be. But the hand of Gollum could still be seen in the way the blazes stopped 100m or so before the second ford and couldn't be seen on the far side until you were into the forest. I knew from the map and the topography that this is where the trail went, but for the solid percentage of who don't use maps or anything other than the elevation profile, it must have been confusing.","Monson
",Bald Mountain Stream,"Jun 15, Thu",14
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569403,"Forgive me trail gods, for I have blue blazed.

The AT, as most people know, involves a gazillion white blazes on trees, rocks, street lights and even a canoe to mark the way from Maine to Georgia. 

Other trails are marked in blue, and following them -- rather than The One True Way -- is known as blue blazing. Many people look down on such actions.

(There's an entire lexicon based on this theme. Yellow blazing, named for the yellow paint marking US roads, means to skip bits of trail by taking a road, whether by driving or hitch hiking. Pink blazing means.... Well, let's just say it reflects the way men vastly outnumber women on the AT, the effect that disparity has on some of the former when it comes to pursuing the latter, and also helps explain why the imbalance exists in the first place and both exacerbates and perpetuates it.)

In my defence, it was bone-ass cold, with driving rain and howling winds, and when the AT -- of course -- went directly over the top of Moxie Bald Mountain, I opted for the far more sheltered and barely 0.4 shorter bypass trail, which quickly intersected once more with The One True Way.

To be entirely honest this isn't my first blue blaze, since I've sometimes gone to a lean to via a short side trail for sobos and then rejoined the AT via the separate side trail used by those going in the other direction.

The AT definitely attracts some trainspotter-style obsessiveness in some of its adherents, to whom what I'd done is nothing short of heresy. 

My own AT philosophy, as in most of my approaches to life, is simply to have fun out here and to have a continuous line of footsteps between the Canadian border and Springer Mountain, the trail's southern terminus in Georgia.

Today was certainly a day when the ""having fun"" brief was a tough one to fulfill. Sometime around 5am, I'd heard the first drops of rain on my tent as a cold steady drizzle set in. 

I waited in the hope that it might blow through but by the time I packed up around 11am, the downpour continued unabated.

This ensured it was a very fast and efficient four miles to the next lean to, Bald Mountain Pond, where I found all the others in attendance. Unaware of my inclination for craven prevarication, they all thought I was way ahead. 

By that point, I was already pretty wet, despite my modified WalMart poncho, and was only warm because I'd been motoring along as fast as I could go.

They offered to make room for me in the lean to, where they were passing the time playing cards and telling stories, and it was an appealing offer since it seemed like they'd have a fun afternoon. 

But I'd also done just four miles that day and was already in wet-weather mode. After weighing up ""comfort vs progress"", I headed on, knowing that the Bald Mountain Brook lean to was just four more miles and the mountain in between here and there was not as high as the one that followed.

I was glad that my fitness levels are getting back to more like how they were in New Zealand rather than in the UAE because I was able to head up Moxie Bald Mountain at a fast enough pace to stay warm. 

The terrain -- ribs of ancient rock still showing the scars of where ice sheets covered this area millennia ago, now coated in lichen forests -- was beautiful, although I'd need to be in different weather to fully appreciate it.

Instead the weather was of a kind that encouraged me to take the bypass trail. Two miles after that, I reached Bald Mountain Brook lean to and found it entirely empty. 

Once I stopped, the exertion that had been keeping hypothermia at bay also stopped and within a few minutes I was shivering so I set up my stove to make potato soup and got in my sleeping bag.

An hour later, it was a surprise when everyone else began to rock in, bearing markedly similar tales of horrendous conditions on the mountain. 

Pan and Tink were followed by Boss and Sweets and then Rapunzel and Wrongway, arrived, having improbably been motivated into leaving the warmth and comfort of the shelter by Jake, a 23-year-old former Marine who'd done 22 miles that day.

It was particularly good to see them because while lying shivering in my sleeping bag earlier, I'd been taunted by imagined scenes of them having a raucous rain day party at the previous shelter. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: On the PCT and CDT, I could have simply stayed put during instances of rainy weather and, with the benefit of hindsight and ignoring the problem of running out of food, in each case it would have added only a week or at most two to how long it took to complete the trail. Something tells me the AT is a whole different beast.","Bald Mountain Stream
",Bald Mountain Brook lean to,"Jun 16, Fri",8
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569404,"What a difference a day makes.

The cloud was still down, denying us the chance of a view from the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain but the absence of yesterday's driving rain and the complete absence of any kind of breeze allowed us to loiter pleasantly on a summit where we would have frozen our asses off just 24 hours earlier. 

But we could not forget yesterday's weather because it had left the entire mountain slippery. Since the AT frequently climbs, descends and traverses steep ribs of the ancient bedrock that form the basis of the Appalachians, that was a problem.

Yet another marked difference about this trail compared to its siblings in the Rockies, the Sierra and the Cascades is that on at least a dozen occasions on any given day, the AT will feature combinations of rocks, roots and mud where a moment's inattention has the potential to result in a hike-ending fall. 

All of us fell today -- several of us multiple times -- but fortunately without dire effects.

That morning Rapunzel was impressed by our leisurely start to the day compared to her previous ""tramily"" -- trail family -- with whom she'd hiked the 100 mile wilderness before a few pesky injuries caused her to linger longer in Monson than they did. 

They liked to get going at 6am but at 7am, there was yet to be any sign of life to emerge from the four of us who slept in the lean to.

In our defence, we were only 15 miles from Caratunk and the weather was now entirely better than yesterday. 

It helped that the trail was easy for the first few miles down to Moxie Pond (although naming something a ""pond"" when it's eight miles long shows that, like their idea of ""wilderness"", Maine operates by different definitions than I'm used to).

A crossing, via stepping stones, of one of the major streams feeding the pond was more of a challenge, particularly for Jake who eschews the use of hiking poles. 

We then had the briefest of road walks before beginning with the real work of the day: climbing Pleasant Pond Mountain.

It was indeed slippery but there were compensations when Jake and I surprised a moose -- his first ever, my fourth on this trip -- as we plugged our way up the mountain. Rapunzel and Wrongway were half a minute too far back to catch a glimpse. 

It was only when we began encountering people who were clean and smelled nice that we realised it must be the weekend. I smiled to myself at the idea that our lives are now sufficiently off the grid that this is the main way in which we know the days of the week.

There were a couple of thru-hikers amid the weekend warriors, including one guy, Bombadil, who'd hiked all the way to Stratton before the ascents and descents did his knees in and forced him off the trail with fewer than 200 miles left. We both commiserated and empathised. 

He'd now recovered and was doing the missing section, with some bonus miles for good measure.

At least the trail was definitely Smeagol's handiwork today, and when we bypassed rather than clambering over the top of a couple of rocky knolls on the summit ridge, we later confessed we'd each felt surprised and relieved -- and also wondered if maybe we'd accidentally wandered off the AT.

For reasons unknown, we also began suffering from getthereitis, thinking each high point on this long and undulating ridge would prove to be the summit. 

Of course this meant it felt even longer before we finally got to the top. This flawed optimism is a universal condition, to the extent that German alpinists coined a word for it: vorgipfel

Thanks to the pleasant temperature on the summit we were able to loiter and put off beginning a descent that lost 1100ft in around a mile. 

Once we actually embarked on the descent, it wasn't nearly as bad as we'd envisaged. Instead the entertainment came in the form of a mountain runner who was on her fourth ascent of the mountain that day, as preparation for the Killington 50 ultramarathon.

Pleasant Pond lean to was six miles from town but after misreading the sign, I added 0.4 miles to my tally by following the blue blazed trail to the beach instead of the shelter. 

We found out later that in yesterday's rain, this tiny shelter hosted half a dozen frozen hikers, bunched up like sardines. 

We caned the final six miles to Caratunk despite the usual mix of roots, rocks and mud being made even more treacherous by the rain.

Our goal was the Caratunk B&B and hiker hostel, about which we'd been hearing and reading glowing reports. 

Everything we'd heard proved to be but a fraction of the welcome we got from Paul and his helper, a 2006 AT veteran named Boulder. Soon we'd found rooms in his 150-year-old restored home at a very modest cost, had resupplied, showered, had Paul do our washing for $3 a load (I'd want danger money to even touch any item of used hiker clothing) and, of course, wolfed down hamburgers and milkshakes that were deemed to be among the best on the trail.

Tomorrow we cross the Kennebunk River -- the largest unbridged river on the entire trail -- via an AT-operated canoe ferry. But because the ferry only operates from 9-11am at this time of year, I guess we'll have to linger over the huge cooked breakfast Paul provides...

",Caratunk,"Jun 17, Sat",14.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569405,"Awesome encounters, it turns out, are not conducive to making the miles. By 1.30pm, we'd managed a grand total of four miles.

But that's exactly the way I'd like it to be, since -- as the cliche says -- this trail is a journey and not a destination. 

The relaxed pace began at breakfast, served at 7.30am so we'd have an appropriately leisurely start before the canoe ferry service, 10 minutes walk away, began operations at 9am.

I've been spoiled by breakfasts on the trail so far but this one still stood out, and we honoured it by eating every last mouthful.

Over breakfast, one of the people we'd met on the summit of Katahdin on June 4, Biscuit, explained how he'd been struggling with some achilles problems. I tried to explain how a five-month trail allowed time to recuperate and the biggest hazard to successfully thru-hiking was to push on through pain.

It's a tough call. Rule one of thru-hiking is to listen to your body but on this trail the idea of a pain-free hike is pure nonsense. Deciding when pain becomes too much is a really difficult task, particularly when hiking with friends who are uninjured.

I was glad to hear he'd opted to take some time off, although I'm sure he'd have found it difficult as he watched us wander over to the ferry.

The first sight of the Kennebunk River made me grateful we weren't faced with fording this one. The flow was apparently low compared to normal, because of the afternoon timing of the hydro releases upstream, but even with some pretty sharp river crossing skills from the New Zealand backcountry, where drowning is our number one cause of fatalities, it would have been formidable.

Being the US, of course we had to sign a legal waiver before being allowed to cross in a Canadian canoe -- complete with white blaze in the floor, to show this was part of the trail -- operated by a river guide who the day before had been taking clients through Class 5 rapids. 

I was very happy to be doing Class 1 flat water instead, and was doubly grateful that the AT authorities operate this service for free as part of the trail. 

Wrongway and I headed over on the fourth load and then made our way up the Riverside slope via switchbacks. Switchbacks! On the AT!

The trail followed up an attractive river valley that vacillated between quiet rippled flow to roaring waterfalls when it encountered rock strata. Progress slowed further when we took a side trail to see a particularly impressive waterfall from below. 

And it slowed further again when I caught up to Rapunzel and we agreed to go for a second breakfast at a game lodge just of the trail that was famous for its pancake breakfasts.

My hiker hunger has definitely kicked in, although I justified it to her as ""helping local economies"". 

After a slightly treacherous crossing of the river via a home made bridge, we arrived at Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp to find it seemingly deserted.

Eventually we found the owner, Tim, working on one of the chalets and while he gently explained how he didn't do pancakes on demand for passing hikers, he was very happy for any hiker who happened to drop by. 

Tim had a fascinating back story, having once been an actuary in Boston before deciding he hated working behind a desk. So 32 years ago, he bought this old-school hunting and fishing lodge in the woods. 

Once there were dozens like this one -- when the AT was completed in the 1930s, the route basically linked together all the camps that then operated.

One by one, modernity put paid to them in the form of rich city people buying them for personal use but Tim had put this one in a kind of covenant that ensures it will always be open to the public, even if in doing so he probably wiped off a huge amount of its market value in the process. That seemed to sum up who he is. 

Even without pancakes we were glad we dropped by and then we made our way -- via another blue blaze -- the 0.3 miles to Pierce Pond lean to.

This had the most idyllic location I'd seen yet, right on the pond so that with a hop, skip and a jump, you'd be in the water. 

That was the point where we realised that it was 1.30pm and we'd done a grand total of four miles.

Our intended destination, Carry Pond lean to, was 10 miles away. Whether we'd get there before dusk depended on whether Smeagol or Gollum dominated the trail conditions. 

For the first three miles, it was like a pitched battle between them, as the trail swapped from ridiculously easy to pointlessly strenuous.

""Nice hikerses deserve a tote road."" 

""No, nasty hikerses must go straight uphill.""

""Nice hikerses can contour around the hill on this easy trail.""

""Nasty hikerses have to go over these mossy, slippery boulders."" 

And so on.

Fortunately, Smeagol trail eventually dominated and we were able to knock off the 10 miles in four hours, arriving at the lean to at the civilised hour of 5.30pm.

Several others were in attendance: Fern and Gully, Ole Guy, Boss and Sweets, and some nobo section hikers who were on their 12th of 13 sessions to complete the AT. Others rolled in over the following hour.

The nice part was that although parts of where we'd walked were as horribly buggy as anywhere we'd seen yet, the mosquitoes at the lean to are tolerable. Others were getting bitten a little but I was fine without deet. 

One major reason why we'd booked it to this shelter is because a thunderstorm is forecast to roll in tomorrow lunchtime. I suspect all those caught up on that cold rainy day a few days back are a little scarred -- and scared -- by the experience, so some of us have brought an extra day's food and aim to hunker down in the next shelter, eight miles away, until the storm passes. 

I've been extolling the virtues of on-trail zero days, as I did on the PCT and CDT. We'll have to see who ends up converted to the idea.

AT fact of the day: The first nobo off the canoe ferry today, seemingly a mileage- and self-obsessed skinny white bearded dude, announced that he'd done 60 miles in the previous 30 hours to get there, adding: ""Beat that!"" As we discussed it later, one of our number went: ""Why would I want to beat that?"" 

Exactly.","Caratunk
",Carry Pond lean to,"Jun 18, Sun",14
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569406,"As anyone who knows me will attest, I am not a morning person.

So for me to not just be awake but hiking at 6am takes something special -- a town day, the prospect of food I haven't cooked myself or, as in today's case, an incoming thunderstorm. 

Despite the less-than-reliable reputation of weather forecasting in this state so far, the consistent forecast for this storm gave us some confidence that this one might actually transpire.

And after the literally chilling effect of the last storm, the idea of hitting this one on the highest peak since Katahdin made us all keen to get to the next lean to, at the start of the ascent of Bigelow, before it arrived around lunchtime. 

But after four sweaty hours of hiking, we arrived at the lean to with no obvious sign that a storm was due to hit.

A group of section hikers were present and they were a friendly and talkative bunch who were clearly enjoying themselves. One of their practices was to take turns reading aloud from a copy of The Lord Of The Rings.

I opted to head on to the next site, Safford Notch campground, which was five miles further. It was uphill, but how difficult could it be? 

The answer was, predictably, difficult. But as I scaled a series of sloping slabs of bedrock similar to the ones that we'd found so treacherously slippery in the aftermath of the last storm, I was more than happy to find them bone dry and correspondingly grippy.

After the usual series of false summits, the real summit of Little Bigelow Mountain arrived -- along with a view of how much steeper and higher the real peak was. 

By then thunder had started rumbling around the valley and dark clouds were building up to the south, so the higher peak could wait until sometime after the storm. 

The trail then decided to become tortuously slow, to the point where I wondered if I'd get to the campground, sited in the saddle between the peaks, before the storm hit. 

When the sign for the side trail finally arrived, I followed it through a boulder field -- including through a cave that had me assessing its potential as a weatherproof storm bastion -- and was inestimably happy to reach the actual campground.

One other hiker was present and exchanged the briefest of introductions before I snaffled a raised wooden tent platform and set up my tent on top. 

Just as I'd shifted my stuff inside, the first few drops of rain began to fall. I zipped myself inside the tent, massacred the few bugs who'd managed to sneak inside and felt far happier than this simple serendipitous success should have warranted. 

The storm ended up being, as someone once described, as ""a political storm -- promising a lot but delivering very little"". After expecting a biblical downpour, the much-feared storm barely wet the tent fly before petering out entirely.

I felt slightly cheated, but then I was happily ensconced in my tent at the wholly civilised hour of 2pm so I also didn't really care. 

The rest of the day was pleasantly indolent -- an on-trail nero during which I finally caught up with this journal but otherwise achieved nothing other than relaxing.

Soon after dinner, the rain returned and settled in for several hours but never at the intensity of the infamous storm of a few days earlier. 

Would tonight's rain continue through tomorrow? I had enough food to take a full day off so an on-trail zero could become a reality.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569665,"After a night of steady rain, the lack of raindrops hitting the tent fly when I first woke up around 5.30am suggested I wasn't going to have my vaunted on-trail zero, for which I'd been carrying an extra day of food.

But given that I'd been here doing nothing since just after lunch the previous day, I wasn't too disappointed at the prospect of moving on. As anyone who knows me will have predicted, that didn't translate into action and I spent the next couple of hours ""assessing the weather"" (code for ""snoozing and occasionally waking up to listen for raindrops"") to be safe. 

When I woke up to find the sun casting shadows of the surrounding trees onto my tent at the far more civilised hour of 8am, I took it as a sign that the rain had indeed passed so I began packing up.

But at pretty much exactly the moment when I'd moved all the various contents of my pack onto the wooden tent shelter, a steady rain began. 

Seriously? I pondered my options: throw all my stuff back into the tent and recommence my, er, ""weather assessing"" role? Or assume this was just a passing shower and move on. 

With town -- and all its benefits -- just 10 miles away, I chose the latter and that seemed rewarded when the rain petered out.

After making my way back on a nearly level trail through the mud, boulders, caves and moose poop for the 0.3 miles back to the junction with the AT, I found that onward travel involved mud, boulders, caves, no moose poop but also absolutely and definitively no level trail either. The ridge leading up towards Avery Peak, the highest point of Mt Bigelow, was even steeper than it had looked on my approach to Safford Notch the day before -- and it had looked pretty steep then. 

But, like a lot of trails in New Zealand, the route ahead was tough but not cruel because it seemed to only be as tough as it needed to be to get where it was going and no more. Unlike some kiwi trails, steep sections were interspersed with short easier stretches that seemed intentionally designed to give the quads a short rest. 

Just to add to the mix, the rain returned and was became heavy enough to justify stopping to put on my WalMart poncho. 

It proved to be a tough day for clothes choices, and whatever choice you made, the weather would then immediately reverse. After donning my poncho and sweating my way up the grunty series of rock steps, the rain eased off but seemed to be just a minute away from starting once more so I kept the poncho on for much longer than warranted before finally stowing it.

I was particularly grateful to be doing this ascent on rested legs rather than at end of the previous day, but even so it took two hours to cover the mile of trail from the notch to the summit, which might be a new record for slowness for me.

Most of the mountains on the AT in Maine feature signs on their summits, giving the name and elevation. So after breaking out of the tree line and seeing the silhouette of a sign emerge through the scudding clouds ahead, I thought I'd finally reached the top. 

It turned out to be a MATC sign asking hikers to preserve the delicate alpine flora by staying to the trail. My impression that I could hear the echoes of previous hikers' profanities at the discovery, I was later to discover when comparing notes with the other sobos in town later that day, proved to be correct.

With immaculate timing, the clouds then cleared and revealed a truly spectacular view -- as befits the summit ridge of the highest mountain since Katahdin. 

After several more similar signs, the actual summit came into view. At more than 4000ft, the wind was pretty cold so this time I donned my rain jacket in the leeward side of the old fire lookout tower right on the summit. The view justified the exertion of getting up here, as it almost always does. 

Supposedly Katahdin could be seen from here -- the first possible sighting for nobos, showing the end of their journey was finally something more tangible than an abstract theory -- but I wasn't sure if it was hidden by the clouds to the north east or if I was simply failing to identify it from among the serried array of peaks that could be seen. No longer having it on the horizon, taunting us by how slow the travel has been in Maine, was an equally important moment for this sobo.

Any hopes that the descent might be easier than the ascent were quickly quashed as the trail towards Bigelow col traversed a boulder field left treacherously slippery by the rain. At the col itself, the sun came out and I took a short break on the porch of the former fire warden's cabin. A series of improved campsites showed this would have been a great place to stop, although I was happy not to be here during yesterday's brief thunderstorm.

The next few hours featured a ridgewalk across the western peak of Bigelow and then over to the Horn, from which it dropped down to Horn Pond, site of another immaculately kept campsite and two lean tos, one built back in the early days of the AT but now only used for day hikers and another more modern version designed for thru-hikers.

The trail had been remarkably busy, with a series of predictably skinny, bearded and fast-paced nobos passing through. 

The only sobo I passed with Poppa, a Virginia native who I'd first met on my first day of the 100 mile wilderness and who stood out for having two enormous cedar hiking poles. Passing him was hardly a unique experience because he was the epitome of the tortoise vs hare parable. Through longer days at a slower pace, as befits his 60-year-old physique, he'd been keeping pace with the main group of sobos. He'd already done 350 miles on the AT much further south, which helped explain why he had his trail legs while the rest of us are still gaining our own. 

It was good to have the chance to chat to him for a little longer than usual and he proved to be an interesting guy. He'd been married with a young child when he enlisted in the Army out of financial necessity. After doing the full 20 years, he went on to a second career as a bomb tech with the FBI and similar government roles. He was a little hesitant when I confided I'd been a journalist, but seemed a little more at ease when I explained that I was (a) retired, and (b) an example of one of the trustworthy hacks.

From Horn Pond, the trail plunged down into the valley via a brutally efficient trail. The final three miles from an established campground on Cranberry Creek was almost flat and took just over an hour, flattering my otherwise snail-like pace of taking eight hours to do just 10 miles of trail. The first seven miles that day told a truer version of the story, with an average speed of just one mile an hour -- the same as I'd averaged through the snow of the Sierra back in 2006. 

From the road, I hitched into Stratton and found lots of familiar faces at the motel and a few others, such as Dragon, who I'd only seen as register entries. In true style, Poppa rocked up an hour or two later, slow but triumphant.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The increasing number of nobos we've been meeting have generally been dismissive of the difficulties of the sections they'd just done and we're about to encounter, suggesting that the main difficulties are well behind them and we're just a bunch of wusses. That's changed since the Bigelows, with most of them expressing both fear and concern about the section we're about to do from Stratton to Rangeley. It's only 32 miles but they've convinced me to change my plan from two days to two and a half. Gulp!","Safford Notch camp ground
",Stratton,"Jun 20, Tue",10
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569666,"The AT today did this: up 3,000ft, straight down 600ft, straight up 500ft, straight down 2,000ft, cross a river, straight up 2,000ft, an undulating ridge walk amid the usual mud, rocks and roots, then 500ft up and 500ft down to the shelter. 

Easy, right?

It seems like all our trail legs are finally kicking in because we managed this without feeling entirely wrecked. It's about time.

It helped that the biggest climb was steady but well-graded and even avoided unnecessary ups and downs on a level section of ridge part way up Crocker Mountain by traversing to one side rather than keeping to one side. This was definitely Smeagol rather than Gollum, although the only person I passed was Poppa, who'd taken the first shuttle from the motel to the trail. 

But this was still the AT, which meant Gollum punished our level of comfort by sending us a blast of cold rain that came in as we neared the 4,000ft summit, taking most of by surprise and forcing us to don our wet weather gear then to keep moving to stay warm. We'd checked the forecast barely two hours before as we left Stratton and there was no mention of this.

My plan had been to get to the next shelter, which would leave just 19 miles, but the rain had me reassessing this schedule in favour of camping at Caribou River, five miles short. But then after half an hour of chilling downpour, the rain stopped as I reached the pass between Crocker Mountain and South Crocker Mountain and the skies cleared once more as if the squall had never occurred.

We'd been warned particularly about the next two miles, which involved a descent straight down to the Caribou River and then straight back up the other side to The Sugarloaf. What made it doubly galling was that the map showed that there was a gentle ridge that headed south east from the Crockers to Spaulding Mountain lean to that would have avoided all this exertion.

The descent was steep enough and blocky enough to be slow going. At every downward step, I tried to keep about 80 per cent of the weight on my hiking poles, without which I suspect this hike would long since have destroyed what remains of my knees. 

The trail grade briefly eased off as it neared the river, which I could hear roaring through the trees and which I'd assumed we'd have to ford. But as Beast, Rare, Dirt and I arrived, we found a plank had been put in place between two boulders, spanning the main channel and allowing us to boulder-hop across with dry feet. A ford would have been possible, but with huge boulders in the stream bed, it wouldn't have been much fun.

If we thought the downhill was tough, the uphill put it into perspective by going from merely concerningly steep to requiring some bouldering moves to get up a stepped rockface.

All this has been hard on our bodies. Shortly before the rockface, I'd run into Dirt and Rare, with the latter stopped because of short and painful twinging on some tendons in her hips. 

This was hardly surprising. Climbing straight up and down hills in the classic AT style uses tendons that rarely get used in normal life and we're not just using these forgotten ligaments but doing so with full loads and for hours at a time. It'd only be surprising if our bodies didn't ache and protest.

The grade eased off a little after that and then took an almost conciliatory angle traversing a high shelf to intersect with The Sugarloaf. Maybe the AT designers had concluded that they'd punished us enough for the day because the trail didn't take us over the summit, which was available via a half-mile side trail

After that, the trail undulated along a ridge, featuring a series of short climbs and descents through a thick forest of stunted pines. Without the trail, this would have been incredibly difficult to shwack through this kind of vegetation.

A final 500ft climb up to near the summit of Spaulding Mountain -- again the summit was available via a short side trail, showing the AT was in a rare beneficent mood after a day of punishment -- and then there was a long and slow descent to the lean to, where the exertions of the day showed in my tiredness more accurately than the mileage. As was becoming the norm, I'd slept much worse in town than on the trail, getting only a few hours of sleep.

Tiredness always had an effect on my perceptions and I kept thinking I was hearing voices just off the trail, to which I ascribed to being near the shelter. Each time I'd hike on and no shelter appeared, showing my perceptions involved flawed optimism.

When the shelter finally appeared, it was good to find Jake and Wrong Way in attendance, with four nobos also settling in. One, an Australian furniture maker named Goose, was from Melbourne and we compared notes about when I lived there back in the 1980s, when people of ordinary income could still afford to live in places like North Carlton.

Over the next couple of hours, Rare, Dirt and Blazer rolled in too, having coped with the strains of the ascent.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The summer solstice is, of course, hike naked day. I'd done this on my own in the Sierra on the PCT in 2006 (while my two companions said, and I quote: ""NOOOOO! It's just wrong.""), again with five of us while resupplying Scout and Frodo on the PCT in 2007 despite the latter's original claim that she would ""absolutely not"" take part, and most recently with Mike in 2010 on the CDT while Wing It and Don't Panic acted as barely-willing photographers and entirely-unwilling witnesses. I'd been reticent to mention this on the AT, in part because it sounds just creepy from someone my age, but today featured seven of us outside the Stratton Hotel, on the main street in town. I'll have to wait to photoshop the result before sharing it, but this tradition is alive and well.","Stratton
",Spaulding Mountain lean to,"Jun 21, Wed",13.50
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569667,"Hiking in 2017 is a different beast to my first American thru-hike back in 2006. When I first started, the first smartphone was still more than a year away from being announced by Steve Jobs but today, in the middle of a tough section, I was able to adjust my schedule and enjoy one of the best days on the trail because of an updated weather forecast received at a remote lean to.

My original plan for this section was to do 13.5 miles to the first lean to, 11 miles to a campsite near the start of the Saddlebacks -- the longest stretch of trail above the tree line since the start of the trail, making good weather important -- and then nine miles along the crest to the highway to get into Rangeley.

The original forecast -- of two good days followed by thunderstorms coming in on the third -- suited this itinerary. But the updated forecast was for rain early tomorrow and although we've taken to treating any such forecast with a large element of disbelief -- yesterday's unforecast chilling squall being a case in point -- it prompted me to do a longer day today while the weather remained good.

And it paid off. 

It helped, of course, that my trail legs are finally kicking in, allowing the option to push the miles if required. Although less than a month after leaving the Canadian border, nobos still seem like an entirely different species and the notion of 16.8 miles being a long day must still seem laughable to them. 

Most of the series of nobos we met today demonstrated the disparity in fitness. Although based on their attitude -- treating the trail as if it was an ordeal to be endured, like a prison sentence or a long and expensive mortgage -- I'd rather have my diminished level of fitness and enhanced sense level of enjoyment over their grizzled stoicism. 

My standard question, ""Are you ready to be done?"", usually elicits a groan, a grimace and a comment along the lines of: ""Oh god yes"" followed by a punishing itinerary of 25-plus mile days so that it would be OVER and they could do something they actually enjoy.

(To be fair, my comment in the lean to register later that day did liken hiking the AT to being in an abusive relationship, with the frequent inflicting of unnecessary and deliberate pain but with occasional nice bits, such as the Saddlebacks, to entice you to stay. Still, I'm enjoying the trail far more now I've slowed down.)

Dew Rag, a former Army sergeant major who was doing the trail after 33 years in the military and who compiled every stereotype that demographic suggested, was a case in point.

When we met him at Poplar Ridge lean to, at which he listed all the things he hated about the trail and how he was going to blast 25-mile days to finish Katahdin. He already had his flight booked to Hong Kong ""to see my girl"" and was then going to hop around various southeast Asian countries.

In the half hour we spent with him, I don't recall a single positive thing he said about the AT and his finishing seemed to be the symptom of some kind of Type A obsessiveness or fear of losing face.

The shelter was a poignant one for having a portrait of Inchworm, a 66-year-old hiker who in 2013 got off trail a few hours north of here, couldn't find her way back and then starved to death in her tent after an indeterminate amount of time. Searchers had been within a few hundred metres of where she was found but she hadn't been able to raise the alarm and when they sent out cadaver dogs, her diary later showed she was still alive and so they hadn't been able to get a scent.

At the other end of the spectrum was the presence in the lean to of a Q&A booklet produced by the long term Maine Appalachian Trail Club member who had helped plot about 100 miles of the AT in this area and who was responsible for maintaining this section for decades. His style was spare but funny, as exemplified by his response to the question ""What's so special about the view from the Saddlebacks, anyway?"", to which he'd replied: ""I'm sorry you had bad weather on your crossing of the Saddlebacks.""

We figured we'd find out for ourselves in the next hour or so. Jake and Wrongway headed off earlier, aiming to get to town, and I headed off at my slower pace, heading along the bumps on the ridge before emerging above the tree line on The Horn.

The trail was brutally steep -- quelle surprise -- but after The Horn, the ridge was relatively gently graded and had outstanding views on all sides. This was the best bit of trail since the Knife Edge on Katahdin.

How Dew Rag, or any of the other get-it-over-with nobos, could be in a bad mood just after doing this part of the trail on a truly gorgeous day was entirely beyond me.

And I actually met a couple of happy nobos on this ridge, and it was no surprise that they had an easier schedule planned for their hike rather than blasting out a series of high-mileage days.

Their smiles were mirrored by my own. Doing this on a day when shorts and a thin shirt were more than enough clothing was simply gorgeous.

On the summit of Saddleback, I could look towards the north west over the array of peaks we'd already hiked over, following a route that extended beyond the horizon -- always a nice feeling. And looking roughly south east I could see huge peaks looming ahead in a week or so: the Whites.

These New Hampshire mountains are generally agreed as the most difficult part of the entire trail, requiring good weather and with sketchy ascents and descents on steep granite. I have plenty of time, so I have the luxury of waiting for good weather. After all, I'm out here to enjoy this rather than treat the AT as most of the nobos were, as a kind of punishment to be endured.

There's an extra level of energy that comes from beautiful terrain, and this extended even as I began the descent back down into the valley, where the more familiar AT of steep wet granite, mud and roots resumed. These were miles to be completed as opposed to savoured, but the trail still went past some beautiful lakes along the way.

I arrived at the lean to and was surprised to find Jake and Wrongway in situ, along with Aloha, who I'd last seen in Monson. Jake and Wrongway have opted to head into town tomorrow and then, respectively, head back on the trail or to do so after one night in a hostel.

Aloha is a new graduate who has a $1,200 budget for his entire hike, which pretty much precludes such luxuries. So far he'd spent $120 and with the 10 per cent mark on the trail a few tenths of the mile away, he was on course. I was grateful not to have those kinds of limitations and thought it best not to mention that my budget was at least five times as much.

They were all good company though and we had a convivial evening around the fire, knowing the road to Rangeley is just 1.9 miles away.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Jake now has a trail name, Nobo the Sobo, because of his long hair, prolific beard, skinny physique, fast pace and high mileage made the rest of us all assume he was a northbounder when he was starting southbound. The trouble is that the name conjures up the Frosty the Snowman song and it's been an earworm that has plagued him all day. But in the spirit of turning lemons into lemonade, he's aiming to do a new AT-apposite verse to the song at every shelter logbook.","Spaulding Mountain lean to

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569668,"Even by the benchmark of grizzled faces, small packs and skinny physiques of most nobos, the one we met this morning on the short hop from Piazza Rock lean to and the road stood out. His pack for the next 100 miles probably weighed less than my food bag for the last 32.

Indeed, he admitted he'd done the PCT and hinted at indeterminate other long distance hikes, so we figured we'd ask him exactly what the Whites would be like.

""I've done a lot of hiking, man, but..."" at which point he paused, shook his head and then looked us in the eye and simply added: ""Fuck!""

Hmmm. I guess we'll find out once we get to it but this was a little unsettling.

The forecast that had prompted me to cross the Saddlebacks yesterday was for rain by mid morning but the rain actually arrived soon after dawn, sometime short of 5am. I'd uncharacteristically slept in the shelter instead of my tent and was truly grateful for that as we dozed and listened to the steady drum of rain on the roof for the next few hours.

Just as we finally gained the energy to head out, the rain eased off and stopped, although we got dripped on by the trees for the short and easy walk to the road.

Because Piazza Rock is a very popular area, the trail was PCT style rather than the masochistic AT version.

Nobo the Sobo, who has been enduring my PCT comparisons for the last 100 miles, asked: ""So the PCT is like this? I could get used to this!""

The three of us arrived at the road with a short period of time and after the derisory attempt at hitch hiking, we walked the 0.3 of a mile to the Hiker Hut, a former meditation retreat which had morphed into an off-the-grid AT hiker hostel. The woman running it was happy to shuttle us into Rangeley for $20, which included allowing me to dump my pack at The Farmhouse, where I'd booked a room, and then gave us the nickel tour of town: restaurants, outfitters, banks and the library.

Now I'm fed and caught up this journal. There's an All Blacks game tonight against the British and Irish Lions at 3.30am -- I didn't even try to find somewhere streaming it -- but at least I'll be a Schroedinger's rugby fan for only a few hours overnight before learning the result rather than being in ignorance for a week.

Did someone say beer? 

The Boston doctor explained he was supposed to be on a trip to Alaska right now but an outburst of sciatica had caused him to cancel his trip so instead he was getting his taste of the outdoors by visiting his holiday cabin near Rangeley.

I met him just before the start of the ascent to Bemis Mountain, by which time I was feeling flat from the after effects of the indeterminate lurgy that had sidelined me the day before.

His car was just nearby and as he opened the hatchback, he realised he'd already taken the beer into the cabin, about 10 miles away. 

""Sorry about that, but I have this,"" he said holding up what appeared to be a tin of beetroot. ""Would you like that?""

""Ah, thanks for the offer but I think I've got everything I need.""

This was probably for the best, since I'd later have to carry the empty beer can for a considerable distance before finding somewhere to dump it.

I was still feeling less than 100 per cent that morning, as demonstrated by my inability to eat my usual enormous town breakfast, on which the rest of the day is usually fuelled. Instead I only managed two slices of pizza from the previous night, where I'd eaten a pitiful two more slices instead of being able to devour the entire thing. 

The remaining half of the pizza went into the pack for snacks, along with the burritos I'd bought earlier as my intended breakfast, then I shared the shuttle back to the trail with Fern, Gully and Rapunzel.

After the difficulties of the Saddlebacks and the Bigelows, I was grateful that the trail was fast and easy. In two hours, we'd reached a campsite beside a lake complete with canoes for hikers to use -- none of which looked particularly seaworthy, but did seem like they'd enjoyed long and full careers -- and then two hours more and we were at the first shelter.

Rapunzel was having knee problems and opted to hitch in to Andover, the next trail town, from the highway another 3.8 miles beyond. Fern and Gully were, sensibly, taking it slow after having some earlier joint pain and weren't aiming to go further than this shelter. Doing this trail sobo is hard on our bodies!

But I was still feeling pretty good at that point so I continued down to the highway, crossed it and headed down to the river, where I met the Boston doctor and his proffered tins of beetroot.

It was as I'd crossed the road that the previous day's illness -- and, more importantly, not eating adequately during the zero day -- that my legs began feeling leaden and my mood flat.

But I knew there was rain forecast for the following day and then through much of the rest of the week so it still seemed wise to book some miles ahead of what was said to be difficult trail as we got closer to the New Hampshire border.

The climb up to the ridgeline was slow but steady and then the trail followed the classic bedrock ribs which had been such a common feature throughout Maine.

I was grateful not to be doing them while wet and even more grateful when I arrived at the turnoff for the Bemis Mountain lean to.

Spiffy and Littlefoot were present, as was Janine, along with a host of nobos -- mostly featuring the all-too-familiar dead eyes and thousand-yard stares, ready to be done but slowed down by the Maine AT and too pig headed or Type-A to quit -- and a veritable flock of hammockers.

I'm still not feeling 100 per cent but I'm back on trail and away from the vortex of comfort at the Farmhouse.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571100,"""I want you to know, Littlefoot,"" I announced as we trudged through muddy forest as hail rained down on us from the heavens, ""that even though this storm was forecast days in advance, I'm holding you personally responsible for it.""

I wasn't being entirely serious but a little while before, on the summit of Old Blue Mountain, she'd blithely announced that she thought the weather was going to clear up.

""Don't jinx us!"" I immediately responded, knowing of the thru-hiker lore that such statements are inevitably and immediately followed by the exact opposite.

For all our reliance on high tech equipment out here, when it comes to weather superstitions, most thru-hikers sound a lot like 17th Century sailors.

That morning there had been a brief and light shower around 6am, followed by blue skies. There was even talk about maybe the forecast had changed since the one we'd seen as we left the Farmhouse.

It hadn't. Of course.

The AT followed the crest of the ridge as we went over the main Bemis Mountain. Ahead I could see the ridge continue to a smaller peak where there had been clear-cutting and knew that couldn't be our route since the entire AT corridor is protected from such things.

Sure enough, the trail traversed around to one side then scaled Old Blue Mountain beyond, where we stopped for lunch on the bare rock slabs of the summit and Littlefoot made her prophetic announcement.

The rain arrived within half an hour, in the form of a thunderstorm that delivered hail and ominous rumbling as we descended the steepest part of the trail since Rangeley.

We knew it wasn't really her fault, but that wasn't about to stop is gently ribbing her about it.

At the bottom of the hill was the first of two roads used to hitch into Andover. I'm hiking right through to Gorham -- a dumb idea in general and particularly when I was on the tail end of an illness -- as is Janine, but Spiffy, and Littlefoot aim to hitch into town from the next road, 10 miles further.

The trail profile showed the first four miles of this were going to be one of the toughest parts of this section, with a climb up to Mt Moody that was higher than the precipitous slope we'd just descended, the far side down to Sawyer Notch was steeper and longer than the one we'd just done and then there was an even longer steep climb up to the shelter.

What could go wrong?

The trail conditions advisory, a laminated piece of paper posted at the start of each section by the Maine Appalachian Trail Club, talked of the first climb being ""rather gentle"", which is not quite the phrase that came to my mind as I puffed and panted my way up. 

Thanks to having long since gained our hiker legs, the initial climb was fine (even if I was much slower than the others) and then the descent was taxing, involving several sections with rebar ladders dropped into the rock, but nothing extreme.

Of rather more concern was it said both sides of Sawyer Notch were ""exceptionally strenuous"", which wasn't too far off the mark for the way in but the trail back up again proved to be steadily graded and on a par with the ""rather gentle"" route up Mt Moody.

In the midst of this ascent, the rain began to fall once more and then became heavy. I stayed under a tree for a while to see if it would blow through but it showed more persistence than most of the squalls we'd been experiencing.

Last night's shelter had been busy, with probably three times as many people present as there had been spaces inside to sleep, so I was a little concerned about this one being similarly oversubscribed. But when I finally arrived at the small six-person shelter at Gunsight Notch, I found it entirely unoccupied other than by Spiffy, Littlefoot and Janine. 

After a brief lull, any thoughts of camping were drowned out, metaphorically at least, by a downpour that wouldn't have been out of place in Fiordland in New Zealand, as although the intensity of the downpour only lasted 20 minutes here and not for half a day, like back home.

""Wish I was camping,"" I quipped as the four of us settled into the lean to for the evening.

AT fact of the day: Janine had been aiming to do 10-mile days to Gorham but realised it was longer than she expected and that she isn't caring enough food. She's carrying about 2,500 calories per day, or only a little more than a sedentary office worker requires and a far cry from the 4-6,000 calories we're probably burning through out here.","Bemis Mountain lean to

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571101,"""Good thing I'm here now and not yesterday during that hail storm.""

And of course barely a few minutes after I said that on top of Bald Pate Mountain, a squall came through that blasted me with hail.

There was a mad rush to put on my rain jacket and to check my pack's waterproofness, then I tried to descend the bare granite slabs on the mountain's southwestern aspect before the flow of water made them even more treacherous than they usually are. All this was done while hunched against the hail.

Then just as I reached the safety of the tree line once more, the squall blew through and the previous blue skies returned. Only the steam from the rain evaporating from still-sunwarmed slabs of rock showed that there'd been a downpour at all.

The suddenness of the change in the weather gave a hint about why Mt Washington, only a few days ahead but several thousand feet higher, had such a reputation for killer storms and other extreme meteorology.

Today had already been an education in other ways, with the ascent of the mountain from the north involving clambering up mostly-damp steep slabs of granite where the trail had cut through the thin veneer of vegetation and exposed the bedrock.

Previously on similar sections of the trail, there'd be signs that others had clambered up the side using roots and saplings, but here it seemed that most people simply trusted the grippiness of the granite. And it was impressively grippy, even though the consequences of exceeding the exact limits of that grippiness didn't bear thinking about.

All of this -- the sudden weather changes, the sketchy rock ascents and the reliance on the granite's grain -- seem to be a hint about what we're likely to experience in the Whites, the high mountain range just across the border in New Hampshire about which nobos have talked about using a mix of fear, veneration, concern and dread.

I guess we'll find out in less than a week.

One of yesterday's lessons seemed to be that rain tended to be an afternoon phenomenon in this part of Maine. After hiking during a succession of storm fronts, this was enough to have me packed and heading out at the modestly early hour of 7.30am. (Ok, so it's not the crack of dawn, but it's nearly an hour earlier than the day before.)

Janine had left before me but with a fast and mostly flat trail, I managed to catch up with and pass her within half an hour or so.

After a couple of undulations, the trail became even better and a stark contrast to the mix of rocks, roots and mud to which we've become accustomed after more than 250 miles on the AT.

Penguin, a nobo hiker I encountered early on today's hike, said it was the best tread he'd seen in 100 miles. I had to think back to Abol Bridge, or possibly the tote road leading to Crawford Pond in the 100 mile wilderness to think of something equally nice.

He also explained the difference between the rest of the AT and its far more brutal version in Maine and New Hampshire: ""Up until now, it's been an achievement. In the last hundred miles, it's become an adventure.""

It was hard to disagree.

Janine, Spiffy and Littlefoot all opted to head into Andover, which meant I was I was hiking alone from the road into town, which I reached after three easy hours or so.

But if the vortex of Andover was drawing hikers off the trail, it was also releasing them and I ran into Rare, Dirt and Luna, who'd gone to Andover the previous day and missed the thunderstorms that had lashed us.

We leapfrogged our way to the next shelter, Frye Notch lean to, and then over Bald Pate Mountain, on which they were in the tree line between the two peaks when the squall hit.

When I wasn't being blasted with hail, I'd been thinking about the tactics for the next stretch through the Mahoosucs, famed for having the single most difficult mile on the AT through the tumbled boulders of Mahoosuc Notch.

I didn't want to hit this in the afternoon, both because of flagging energy levels after lunch and because that's when the downpours were more common. There was a campsite just before the start of the notch and seven miles into the next section. 

I'd planned to hike the 2.3 miles from Bald Pate lean to Grafton Notch today but it didn't seem to make much sense to blast out 16 miles today and only seven tomorrow, even if my renewed energy levels showed I'd finally thrown off the lurgy I'd picked up in Rangeley. 

An early afternoon? That will do nicely!

Rare and Dirt opted to continue, aiming to do the notch tomorrow because they didn't have three days of food like me.

My indolence was rewarded when two more significant strong squalls lashed the mountain over the next hour.

I'm sharing the lean to with a Maine mother and her precocious, unintentionally-comical and entirely self-unaware 10-year-old son.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: On my previous thru-hikes, I've generally used ibuprofen -- an anti-inflammatory so commonly used that it's known in the hiking community as ""Vitamin I"" -- only occasionally and mostly in the final month of each hike. That's not the case out here, where the arduous terrain of the AT has had me using it for my troublesome right knee within the first week. From occasional use, I've now been using it most evenings and last night, I took a second dose around midnight and did so again tonight. It's under control, but I don't like the trajectory this seems to be on.","Hall Mountain lean to
",Bald Pate lean to,"Jun 28, Wed",14
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571103,"The consistent message from the nobos we'd been meeting was that the next part of the trail into New Hampshire was really tough and slow. Given that their benchmark for this was having just done the Whites, this is a warning I've been tanking seriously.

After an easy 2.3 miles down to Grafton Notch from the lean to, we then only had to do about seven more miles, starting with a 2,500ft climb up to Old Speck Mountain.

I wasn't too worried about this because we'd cruised up the 3,000ft climb from Stratton to Mt Crocker only a week or two before, as part of a day with 6,000ft of cumulative ascent.

The main difference was that Grafton Notch marked the point where trail responsibility had shifted from the Maine Appalachian Trail Club, which oversaw everything since Katahdin, to the Appalachian Mountain Club, which also ran the upscale lodges found throughout the Whites.

The log book in the Bald Pate lean to was full of nobos expressing their disdain for the AMC and its mercantile philosophies, variously repurposing the acronym to be Appalachian Millionaires' Club and the @sshole Money Collectors.

While there wasn't a toll on the trail (although there was a voluntary user-fee point at the trailhead, which I think is the first for this trip), we wondered whether to expect a different approach to trail making. I suspected, however, the hitherto rejection of the concept of switchbacks was unlikely to change.

The trail was indeed steep but not stupidly so, and it worked its way up using the topography to make things easier rather than more difficult. Still, it took until 1pm -- far longer than on Mt Crocker, leaving me more knackered and wondering if the previous week had depleted my energy reserves rather than making me more fit.

On the final part of the ascent, I was passed by a trail runner leaping along at a pace that put my own to shame. I then encountered a large school group coming down from the summit, to whom the trip leaders accompanying the participants explained what thru hiking entailed. The kids responded with a mix of shock and incomprehension.

Despite the exertion of the ascent, I opted to make the 0.3 mile side trip to the summit of Old Speck Mountain, the third highest in Maine. After all, this was a short day, right?

Boss and Sweets had been leapfrogging me on the ascent and bypassed me while I was doing the side trail. Once on the summit ridge, progress slowed in inverse proportion to the difficulty level, with frequent descents of steep granite ribs that made me grateful once again to be doing this in dry conditions.

The weather seemed to be similar to the last few days with mostly sunny mornings and clouds building towards a shower in the afternoon, so I boogied on ahead -- if a pace of barely 1.5mph can be described in such terms -- to the Speck Pond shelter.

This was the clearest example yet of the AMC difference. The lean to was in the process of construction but was twice the size of the others before it and built with a far higher design standard, so it looked more like an upmarket Colorado ski chalet than an AT shelter.

It was also the first shelter we'd encountered that charged money: $10, which supposedly paid for a caretaker to ""advise on leave no trace principles"" and for trail maintenance.

There were a couple of beat-down nobos present, which was not surprising given that they'd just done Mahoosuc Arm -- reputedly the third-steepest mile on the AT -- and Mahoosuc Notch, the undisputed toughest single mile on the trail.

They provided some beta about the arm and particularly the steep granite slabs that needed to be descended, which I was keen to do before the afternoon rain arrived.

All this kept me moving as swiftly as the terrain would allow until I reached to top of the arm and the beginning of the granite slabs.

After my experience on Bald Pate, where my perception of the slip/grip factor of the wet granite had seemed to be a little conservative, I was hoping for the chance to test the limits if I could find somewhere safe to do so. This conservatism wasn't a bad thing, since being too bold had the potential to end very badly in most places.

But at the top of one such slope which ended safely in some bushes if things went wrong, I tried descending using tiny shuffled steps.

I was thinking ""This isn't so diffi..."" when my feet slid from under me with a rapidness that shocked me both with its speed and the force when I landed on my backside, grateful that my pack took the brunt of the impact.

""OK, so maybe conservatism isn't so bad after all,"" I thought to myself as I then adopted a far less risky approach to the real slabs, with very real consequences, that followed. 

(Note: this is the only context in which the phrase, ""maybe conservatism isn't so bad"", is ever likely to be said by me.)

This was just the second time I'd slipped on the AT, after going for a slide on a sloping bog bridge left treacherously slick by the storm on Moxie Bald. Given the daily potential for hiking-ending slips on this trail, I was happy not to add to this tally.

A series of section hikers came up the trail and announced that the going lower down was easier, which was a good thing. Even the worst parts of the descent had involved the ability to use roots and trees as a Plan B in case I slipped for a third time.

Soon I was on ""normal"" AT tread -- mud, roots and rocks -- and was able to canter along to a surprising capacious campsite just before the start of Mahoosuc Notch.

It was 4pm by then and I felt a dangerous sense of pleasure in having beaten the rain. Boss and Sweets arrived about 45 minutes later, followed by a couple of nobos who's just come through the notch.

I thought briefly about heading through the notch to get it out of the way but the advice of all the nobos had been that while the notch was a mix of strenuousness and fun, it was not a place to be in the rain so I dismissed that thought and settled in to my tent, confident in our plan to tackle the notch in the dry of the morning. I mean, what could go wrong?

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The getthereitis of nearly all nobo hikers had dissipated a little recently, although it was still a tiny minority who were opting to take their time and enjoy their final weeks of an epic journey.

",Mahoosuc Notch,"Jun 29, Thu",9.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571104,"Who put the suck into the Mahoosuc Notch?

Rain did!

Our cunning plan to avoid the regular afternoon showers by doing the notch in the morning wasn't looking quite so cunning when I woke up to heavy rain at dawn, with the deluge having started soon after dusk the previous evening.

It seemed to ease off again around 7.30am so I packed up and emerged from the tent -- at exactly the time the downpour started anew.

But then the rain stopped entirely and I made my way up towards the start of the notch, which was basically a gently sloping canyon between two cliffs and filled with a jumble of cabin-sized boulders that had fallen from above and through which the AT made its way.

Even though the rain had stopped, its effects were still definitely present in the form of slippery rock surfaces. Given the topography of the gorge and the way it held snow until deep into the summer, it seemed unlikely to ever be completely dry but about the only way it could have been more treacherous was if it had been still raining now. Happily, it wasn't.

I'd been steeling myself for more slippery slabs but the reality was a series of grantor granite blocks that felt slightly easier than the slabs and in almost every difficult move, there was a branch, root or incut hold that serves as a Plan B if I slipped.

In that sense, traversing the notch solo and after rain proved to be more of an exercise in risk management rather than technical difficulty, and I found myself really enjoying the process of working out the bouldering moves.

When I met a couple like of nobos in mid notch, I told them I was surprised how straightforward it had been, to which their reaction was that they'd had an entirely different experience.

Once past them, their reaction was explained by the presence of a few more technical sections, including one famous spot where you have to haul your pack through after you, but nothing particularly difficult.

About 20 minutes further in, I heard raucous laughter and turned a corner to see another nobo hanging onto a boulder trying to get around a block of granite.

She explained that she was still recovering from a fractured wrist, which made it difficult to use all her strength, but she seemed to be having the time of her life rather than undergoing some kind of ordeal.

I never got her name but she announced herself as a cancer survivor who'd started the trail last year as soon as her treatment regime allowed it and got a far as, I think, the Shenandoahs before winter forced her of the trail. She'd resumed her journey in March and had to take a couple of breaks from the trail -- one to see her daughter play for the Puerto Rico soccer team and then to watch her son's band open for 21 Pilots. 

She wasn't breaking any speed records -- she'd already spent two hours traversing what proved to be about the top third of the mile-long notch -- but her enthusiasm was both refreshing and contagious.

It took only another 30 minutes or so to emerge back on to trail at the top of the notch, at which point any hopes of easy ground were dashed by the ascent of Fulling Mill Mountain, which was less technical than the notch but far steeper.

A few minutes later, I encountered a grizzled grey-haired nobo who was standing still and announced that if need to come up to where he was ""because I've already fallen on my ass and don't want to do it again with an audience"".

The difference compared to the exuberant cancer survivor could hardly have been more profound. The AT, he announced, was the dumbest thing he'd ever done in his life and he couldn't wait to be done, but the trail was slowing him down from ending the misery as fast as he'd like.

""I used to be able to do a 10 by 10"" -- an AT term meaning 10 miles by 10am -- ""but here I'm struggling to do more than 10 miles on a day...""

I wanted to shake him and say: ""But you're out of the long green tunnel and you're in by far the most beautiful state, with a continuous array of gobsmacking views, and all you can think about is not doing 10 by 10 any more?""

But he has to hike his own hike and I held my tongue other than to gently suggest ways in which lessening his miles and lightning his load might increase the enjoyment factor. He was just another burned-out, dead-eyed nobo who'd long since stopped getting enjoyment from the trail but was too pig-headed to quit.

One of his many warnings about the trail I had ahead was about a single-plank bog bridge which had pitched him into waist-deep mud. 

Later two other nobos separately warned me about the same big bridge, having suffered similar mishaps.

The next few hours were spent following the undulating ridgeline from Fulling Mill Mountain through to Success Mountain, a six-mile stretch made even more gorgeous by having clear weather and pleasant temperatures.

Gorgeous, of course, does not equate with fast, and in between stretches of good trail were a variety of impediments that slowed me -- and, it was clear, mile-hungry nobos -- to a glacial pace.

Sometimes it was bogs, sometimes it was slippery ribs of bedrock granite, sometimes it was rebar ladders but most of the time it was a series of treacherous wet granite cliffs which I had to ascend or descend with particular care.

I think I found the famous single-plank bog bridge but as I got to it, I gave the plank a prod with my hiking poles and it simply floated about 10cm further into the mire. It was clearly not connected to anything and was simply floating in the mud -- who on earth would think this was a sensible thing on which to put one's weight?

I figured they must be another similar plank further on but there wasn't.

Instead the trail continued to vacillate between straightforward travel and an endless series of ""Oh god, what now?"" moments which made everything even slower and explained the depressed nature of the vast majority of the nobos.

It was while traversing one of these that I realised that the Mahoosuc Notch was just like a compendium of the worst of these impediments, except strung together in one section and with -- thankfully -- the seriousness dialed down a bit.

There was a shelter in the middle of this stretch but my goal was the Gentian Pond lean to, more than 12 miles in from my campsite. One compelling reason was it was just across the state border and into New Hampshire, so I'd finally be done with Maine after about 35 days or so. Even though I wasn't expecting a miraculous change to rolling hills and well-graded trail, the other compelling factor was the send lean to was then about 12 miles from the road, making reaching Gorham -- town! food! showers! warmth! comfort! -- tomorrow a near certainty, even if there remained a few more surprises still to come.

I was lucky that the trail after Mt Success opted to go easy on me. By then it had begun to rain hard and the darkened skies -- more from the storm than the approaching dusk -- made progress a little treacherous.

""This is the time of day when it's easy to make mistakes,"" I kept reminding myself, taking extra care on the steep descents and through the slippery mud of the trail.

Life out here is about taking pleasure from small victories, and I was very happy to see the turnoff to Gentian Pond lean to appear out of the murk. A few minutes later, I was amid half a dozen thru- and section-hikers who'd mostly come from Gorham to here.

It was nice to have company for the evening after a tough day. It's always a little difficult to judge others' advice about the difficulties of the way ahead because neither side has done the others' section so there's a challenge to calibrate expectations and impressions. Even so, it sounds like the next 12 miles won't be quite as taxing.

But given that the last section for me included the undisputed toughest mile on the AT and a stretch that halves nobos' mileage aspirations, I'm not sure that's much comfort...

Even so, life is good.

AT fact of the day: ""Did you want to see a moose?"" one of the lean to dwellers asked. ""There's one on the pond, or there was a few minutes ago."" And sure enough, as I went to get water, there was a moose on the far side of the pond, happily chewing away at the aquatic plants. Moose number five for the trip! It's probably better to keep this quiet since there still seem to be a solid proportion of both nobos and sobos who are yet to see one...","Mahoosuc Notch

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571159,"The day hiker gave me a serious look and warned me in grave terms that there was ""a rocky stretch"" ahead.

""It's all rocky,"" I quipped back, probably a little too glibly after the previous day's travails.

""You'll see,"" he responded, using the tone of voice reserved to address those who are about to experience a fall, either metaphorically or, in this case, literally.

It was enough to make me ponder whether I was being cockily overconfident, but the rocky patch he was referring to was no worse than the hazardous jumbles I'd scrambled over at least 50 times on the previous day and on a multi-daily basis since the start of the trail more than a month ago.

Just as the difficulties of the trail had eased after Mt Success last night, today I encountered nothing even remotely approaching the impediments of yesterday.

Instead the main echo of the previous day's trail was seeing two more moose -- the trip's sixth and seventh -- in a bog just before Success Pond.

My inherently pessimistic prediction was to get into Gorham by 4pm but the ease of the trail allowed that to beat that by an hour and a half, which proved to be fortunate when the skies opened.

I paid for a worker at the White Mountains Lodge, sited next to the trailhead, to shuttle me the five miles into town. In my usual way, I was going to eat first and then shower but the driver said he was ""going to do a good deed for the other people at the restaurant"" by taking me first to The Barn, which specialised in hosting AT hikers.

And it had to be said, after six mostly wet and entirely sweaty days on the trail since Rangely, he was probably right. 

This in turn meant I was in my lodgings when what was initially just another rainstorm became a Fiordland-style deluge that prompted warnings of flash flooding and even a tornado. Sometimes the universe can look out for cocky hikers, rather than always giving them lessons in benchmarking and hubris...

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571682,"After more than a month of encountering a procession of mostly dead-eyed and burnt-out nobos, I figured I should walk a mile in their shoes. 

Or even 21.1 of them.

This doesn't mean I've gained a hankering to re-traverse Maine -- for all the fun of the Mahoosuc Notch, most of this trip is not an experience I have any particular desire to revisit -- but when it came to slackpacking this section of the White Mountains, it made sense to do it from south to north rather than to do it sobo.

Part of the reason was I wasn't just slackpacking. I was luxury slackpacking by paying for a night at the AMC's Carter Notch hut and doing this section over two days. Instead of having to do 21.1 tough miles in one day, I did it in two.

The presence of the hut much closer to the southern end than the middle meant that it made more sense to do an easy (or at least easier) 5.8 mile day into the hut and spend an afternoon enjoying its facilities and then make an early start the next day for the 15-mile trek back to Highway 2, where I'd emerged from the Mahoosucs a few days before.

That and the ascent into the Wildcats from Pinkham Notch was reputed to be among the steepest on the entire trail. It made a lot more sense to do that first thing and going up than at the end of the day and in descent.

This was, I'd explained to some of the others, the ""be kind to my knees by being cruel to my budget"" part of the hike. Paying for the hut meant I only had to carry a few snacks and the usual wet- and cold-weather gear rather than my tent, stove, food etc.

After being dropped off at Crawford Notch, there was an initial confusion about exactly where the trail northbound went. Once I worked out that, the first mile was definitely not the steepest on the AT, instead taking an easy and flat path near Lost Pond, until the second mile took an uncompromising route directly up the side of a classically glaciated valley.

But unlike the Mahoosucs, the terrain wasn't sketchy. Anywhere the granite veered towards dangerous steepness, there'd be wooden boards bolted into the rock to provide purchase or footholds would be drilled into the rock face. This was a level of civility I hadn't expected to find, given that the AMC was also responsible for the Mahoosucs section of the AT.

There were a few others also heading up the slope, who were gracious enough to allow me to head through, and after an hour of remarkably pain-free ascent, I topped out on the fifth of the Wildcat peaks, the imaginatively-named Wildcat E.

The approach to Wildcats D stood out for the presence of dozens of raucous children and a throng of people who were barely adequately dressed to go to the mall, rather than a mountaintop in the Whites. Emerging from the trees to find that the chairlift from Wildcats Ski Resort, just to the north of the ridgeline, ran through the summer as well as the winter explained that particular mystery

Wildcats C, B and A quickly followed, mostly with modest ascents and descents between them until the end of the range neared, where the ridge was replaced by a dramatic notch between the Wildcats and the Carters. At the bottom of this was the AMC's Carter Notch hut, nestled amid a couple of small lakes.

As with the ascent from Pinkham Notch, the quality of the trail was of a kind we could only dream of in the previous section of trail. Soon I was traversing beside the small lakes I'd seen from above and then walked up to the steps of the hut. 

Carter Notch was run entirely by omen, although a supervisor called Eric was visiting as part of his role in checking in on all the different AMC huts in the region. I soon had a rundown on how the hut worked, the timing of dinner and breakfast and the privileges of staying as opposed to visiting, which amounted to free lemonade rather than paying $1 a glass as the great unwashed had to do.

The hut had a capacity of 40 but there were only 15 other paying guests, so we managed to fit around two tables for dinner. In keeping with what a nobo hiker had explained to me earlier, the patrons were all ""rich white people"" -- a couple bagging New Hampshire's 48 mountains higher than 4000ft, a mother with her archetypally disengaged teenaged daughter, a couple of families with young kids and a slightly odd solo guy from New Jersey. All were from nearby states and they were convivial company.

I was already aware of the slightly strained relations between the AMC and the thru-hiking community. They were, after all, entirely different constituencies: one serving people happy to pay nearly $100/night and the others mostly living as cheaply as possible. One area in which the AMC sought to accommodate hikers was through a scheme known as ""work for stay"", where a few hikers had the chance to help out around the hut in return for being allowed to sleep on the floor and eating the leftover food at dinner and breakfast.

A couple of nobos rocked in and asked for work for stay. With less than 50 per cent capacity, there were a couple of empty tables in the small dining room but during dinner the hut staff -- college-aged kids known as the ""croo"" -- made the hikers sit outside in the small and chilly vestibule instead. Unsurprisingly, this struck a discordant note with my egalitarian sensibilities and exacerbated the discomfort I usually feel when I find myself on the rich-and-privileged side of the spectrum.

As dinner ended and the hikers returned from their isolation, I took the chance to go to bed. My morals might feel a little compromised by this stay in an AMC hut, but my knees are certainly enjoying it.

",Carter Notch Hut,"Jul 03, Mon",5.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571683,"Throughout the day, I watched the look of incomprehension on the faces of the dozen or so sobos I encountered. 

There was the momentary surprise to encounter their sobo colleague heading in the opposite direction, followed by the mental gymnastics as they tried to work out whether I was going the wrong way or -- the horror -- maybe they were.

But once I'd explained that I was doing this section northbound, the conversations reverted to the usual hiker camaraderie in which we caught up on what had happened since we'd last crossed paths. Sometimes the gap had been little more than a day, but other times it would be a week or more since I'd seen some of these people and for many -- such as Beast and Mary Poppins -- there was the acknowledgement that I'd thought they were days ahead. 

The latest forecast, provided by the AMC hut staff that morning, had been for steadily improving weather, which meant tomorrow was going to be perfectly timed to head into the Presidential range. In the meantime, there were going to be some high winds but otherwise dry conditions.

Even better than the forecast was the hut breakfast, which was the perfect start to the day by featuring foods that I know work perfectly for my physiology -- such as porridge and pancakes -- but which I rarely make because of the time/mess/hassle factor. 

Most of the hut's paying guests were heading to Carter Dome and the rest of the Carters and we left at about the same time. The slightly odd New Jersey guy opted to try to outpace me up the formidable hill directly up Carter Dome from the notch, but the combination of a month of thru-hiker fitness since Katahdin and carrying virtually nothing meant that was never going to be a contest. I left him in the dust.

Once on the crest of the ridge, the strong winds made me grateful that the route remained entirely in the trees. Progress slowed a little as the trail quality deteriorated to scrambling down wet granite slabs in the descent towards Imp Shelter, where most of the sobo herd had stayed.

But at the start of the final ascent to Mt Moriah, the trail headed straight up a series of sloping bedrock ledges. Spiffy and Littlefoot were descending these just as I arrived and we compared notes on how glad we were to be doing it in dry conditions.

Besides the sobos, there were plenty of people out celebrating Independence Day but there was nobody else around as I began the long descent down to Highway 2. The trail gradually became easier, from the familiar stacked boulder staircases, down to the equally recognisable rock and root mazes and then something we hadn't seen for weeks: easy flat trail.

Elwood, who'd signed the register at the hut two miles from the road, summed it up when he said the nature of the trail made him question whether he was actually on the AT. Either way, it made for fast progress until I could hear and then see the highway.

It took only a few minutes to cross my path from two days before, to keep the continuous line of footprints, and then to get a hitch back to Gorman and The Barn. A similar hiker reunion happened in the hostel, where I saw people like Fern, Gully, Packaged Meat and Nine, who I hadn't seen since before the Mahoosucs. We compared notes on how we'd all fared during the big storm of a few days earlier.

My wallet might not agree, but my knees don't hurt in the way they probably would have if I'd done this section with a full pack. Since my philosophy has always been to focus on ensuring I get through the big mountains, ending at the far side of the Whites, with body and enthusiasm intact, financial considerations come a distant second.

AT fact of the day: There was no chance of an early night on the 4th of July. The fireworks made it sound like Syria, which was an impressive effort for a town of modest size such as Gorham.","Carter Notch Hut
",Gorham,"Jul 04, Tue",15.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571684,"One of the factors involved in preparing for the AT was the recognition that it was likely I'd have many days of hiking in the rain. 

But I always intended for there to be three exceptions to this: Katahdin, the Presidential Range and Franconia Ridge. Each one involved high mountain ridges that could be dangerous in bad weather, but the real answer was that they were also some of the best views on the trail and it was worth waiting for clear weather. 

Even so, I couldn't have hoped for better weather for the Presidentials. As Paul from The Barn drove me the eight miles to Pinkham Notch, the view of Mt Washington without a cloud in the sky was something I hadn't seen at any point since leaving the Canadian border more than five weeks earlier.

My original plan -- part of my ""cruel to the budget, kind to my knees"" philosophy -- was to book a night at Madison Springs Hut. Unsurprisingly with a forecast like this, the hut was fully booked and there had been no cancellations.

Plan B was to take my sleeping bag and inflatable mat, so I could ask for work-for-stay at the huts. It meant leaving my tent, cooker and most of my food behind and hoping it would all work out.

I was feeling a little lethargic after my trek across the Wildcats so I took it slowly across the nearly level trail traversing out into the Great Gulf, on the far side of which the AT followed a ridge to Mt Madison, the easternmost of the Presidentials.

After an hour or so, I was overtaken by Mary Poppins, Pouffe and Hot Mess Express, who were slackpacking the Presidentials by hiking with daypacks on the AT to Mt Washington and then hitching down the auto road and back to town for the night. The plan was to hike back up to Mt Washington from the southern AT approach the next day.

But while they hiked ferociously fast, they also took equally impressive breaks and when I slowly made my way across the Peabody River bridge, I found them just heading off again. 

""You guys definitely put the slack into slackpacking,"" I quipped as they sped off uphill.

The cruisey terrain of the traverse came to an abrupt end at the Osgood Campsite, at which point the trail headed directly up with a directness that had exemplified the AT thus far through New England. 

There was nothing for it but to plod upwards at a steady pace. With the tree line restricting views, the only diversion was meeting some of the summer camp hiking groups that were plying the range, one of which had a unicorn helmet -- a photo is coming -- which I was informed served as the ""power object"" for the group. I was hoping to learn more but they sped past downhill.

Mt Madison is more than 5,300ft, making it higher than Katahdin so even as I emerged from the tree line, there was plenty of climbing still to do. 

But having the extensive views of a day like this was invigorating and the earlier leaden limbs were long gone. A series of people came past, most amazed at how nice a day it was.

I'd been carrying rain pants -- something I hate and rarely use, other than in full mountaineering -- but I was perfectly comfortable just in a pair of shorts and a thermal top. It's always like this, right?

At the top of Mt Madison, there were maybe 20 people -- including Mary Poppins and Pouffe, who were in the midst of one of their extravagant breaks. 

The weather was so extraordinarily calm that black flies were a problem, and they can only fly at 2mph. It really was something special to be up here in these conditions.

Madison Springs Hut was only half a mile away so I made my way down and asked if I could do work-for-stay. This is often a tricky balancing act: ask too early and they might send you on to the next hut. Ask too late and they might already have all the helpers they need.

I seemed to have timed it perfectly. I was the first to ask about it that day and they were happy to recruit me. 

Later two nobos, Socks and Alps, along with my sobo colleagues Rare and Dirt, arrived and were also given work for stay. It seemed that this was a particularly hiker-friendly hut -- one of the ""croo"" was a former AT thru-hiker -- and they were happy for us to sit at our own table in the dining room rather than banishing us outside, as had happened to the thru-hikers at Carter Notch Hut.

Earlier that day I'd run into Lucky, an Irish hiker, who said seven of them had done work for stay the night before, intimating that they accept all who ask for it.

He also suggested that we were starting to run out of the speed-obsessed dead-eyed nobos. He exemplified this trend by saying he felt bittersweet about finishing and was really enjoying himself. 

We were plied with plate after plate of leftovers from the previous day and then we were asked to demolish the leftover pulled pork from that evening's dinner. Everyone else present was paying between $93 (for AMC members) and $109 for this, but our payment for all this was about 20 minutes of light cleaning. 

When we tried to do this as diligently as possible, with the aim of creating a good impression to help the hikers who would follow us, we were advised that ""it doesn't have to be perfect"".

After a truly magnificent sunset, the guests all headed to the bunkrooms and we bedded down in the dining area. With full bellies, a good night's sleep was going to add the perfect finale to an awesome day.

Did I mention that life is good?

",Madison Springs Hut,"Jul 05, Wed",7.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571685,"At some point on this trip, we'll cross an invisible crucible marking the point where we've done harder terrain than the nobos we've been meeting.

I suspect we'll only know this for sure afterwards, but some strong evidence suggesting we might have already passed this point came when I was asking some nobos how fast the trail along the southern Presidential Range would be to Mizpah Hut

""It's pretty rough trail, like this,"" one woman said, gesturing to a broad and slightly rocky tread that I'd have salivated over throughout most of Maine.

I couldn't help myself. ""This? Rough? This is some of the best trail I've seen in weeks!""

And I meant it, even if it wasn't very polite to point it out. Along with the dead-eyed speedster nobos, another sub-group we'd identified among the northbounders is the supercilious know-it-all who talks down to the clueless sobos and I wanted to avoid doing the same thing.

All this was in the process of crossing the Presidentials, the highest and potentially most hazardous section of the AT on account of the wild weather this otherwise modest mountain range attracts.

Completing it in benign conditions for the 12-mile stretch above the tree line was just one more worrisome stretch we could now or behind us and stop worrying about. 

This tally had already included Katahdin, the 100 mile wilderness, the Bigelows, the Saddlebacks, Mahoosuc Notch, the rest of the Mahoosucs, the Wildcats etc etc. We're now definitely in the lower part of this list, having crossed one off after another, usually having found the hype failed to match the reality.

I thought my chance for a clear summit for Mt Washington had passed with yesterday's clear blue skies.

At Madison Springs Hut overnight, the wind had picked up and forced Rare, who was camping outside with Luna, to give up and sleep in the vestibule of the hut instead.

Although the hut was in the sun, there was a thick bank of cloud over Mt Washington, 1400ft higher. But as I made my way along the ridge, the clouds gradually lifted until the summit was clear. 

It still wasn't a patch on yesterday's bluebird day, with a thick layer of cloud hovering above the summit and casting a grey tone over the views, but any day without sleet and 70mph winds on this ridge was one to savour.

The trail made its way up to and beside the cog railroad -- the world's oldest, having just predated the civil war -- and AT hiker tradition is to moon the train as it passes to show the disdain at those who get up here without earning the view the way we did.

Two trains went past me when I was walking near the line but the passengers were so happy, smiling, waving at us and so clearly enjoying themselves that I just couldn't do it. 

Soon after that, I stepped up to the summit complex, comprising a visitor centre, museum, post office, viewing platform etc. Others had talked about the shock of walking into this morass of holidaymakers from middle America, and I remembered my own encounters with this kind of thing at Yosemite after the isolation of the Sierra and later at the casino buffets in Tahoe.

But it was actually OK and I was more than happy to partake of food I hadn't had to carry, with the summit chili bridging the gap since the last of the blueberry pancakes at breakfast at Madison Springs Hut.

There was even a moderate queue for the summit marker photo, so I waited the few minutes to get my photo taken in the shorts and thermal top in which I'd made the ascent. Behind me was a nobo who'd already had his photo taken here when the mountain was socked in and had come back for one now it was clear.

The most popular of the AMC huts, Lakes of the Clouds, was just 1.5 miles down the hill to the south and, having been advised about its hiker-friendliness, half contemplated doing work-for-stay there. A sense of work ethic and a forecast for rain prompted me to continue to Mizpah Hut, a little over five miles further and only seven miles out from the road.

This was when the nobos told us about the ""rough trail"". The rest of the way proved to be fast and instead of arriving at 5.30, in the midst of pre-dinner madness, I was there by 4.30, where my request to work for stay was accepted.

An hour later, I'd organised the dress-up clothes hamper, arranged the library back into a semblance of order and gone through the toy box to weed out their incomplete sets of cards (four packs out of five) and other useless things like a Yahtzee set with only four of the five dice.

Rare, Dirt and Switchback then arrived and also got work-for-stay, which saved me from spending a further hour after dinner with my hands in the sink.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572333,"I'd expected the Presidentials might be a little, well, boring once we'd dropped back into the tree line, but our glacial pace this morning along the Webster Cliff Trail wasn't because of trail difficulty.

Instead the problem was the polar opposite: a series of gobsmacking views that had us continually stopping to soak them in.

Rare, Dirt and a fast young sobo by the name of Switchback and I had the chance for a leisurely breakfast, since the young hut workers had asked us to do a morning chore of sweeping out the dining area in return for being fed all the excess blueberry and coconut porridge, coffee and cinnamon rolls left over from the paying guests' breakfasts.

Since we were just sitting around waiting as the croo completed their tasks, I suggested we take the opportunity to do the sweeping. With everyone helping, it took about five minutes.

But just to show that no good deed goes unpunished, the croo then announced that we needed to sweep all the bunkrooms and fold the blankets. There were a few grumbles about this, particularly since Dirt and Switchback were keen to get going, but we also knew that anything we did now wouldn't affect us but would the hikers that followed, so we kept silent and completed the work. Once again, with all of us involved, it took far less time than we feared and we were on the trail by 8.40am.

After that it was the views that conspired to slow us down, but we finally dropped off the ridge and into the forest, where the absence of vistas meant we booked it to the highway at Crawford Notch.

The others all went for a swim before climbing the other side of the valley towards Zealand Falls Hut but I was heading back to Gorham, where I'd stashed my extra gear while traversing the Presidentials. 

Now that we'd done the hardest above-treeline section of the trail, it meant I could send some of my cold-weather gear ahead to pick up after I finished the trail.

Three hitchhiking lifts -- one with a pair of mountain guides with whom we chatted about adventures in the world's crinklier corners, the next with an AMC worker who referred to his workplace as the ""Appalachian Money Club"" and finally with a guy heading up for a fishing weekend -- got me back to Gorham and what was by now my second home at The Barn hiker hostel.

There were a few familiar faces around, such as Fern and Gully who were about to head up to Madison Springs Hut but bailed because of the poor weather forecast.

However, what made the biggest impression was how the next wave of sobos had arrived, showing the same familiarity with each other as the group who started around the same time as us but who is never seen. 

But I also knew the nature of the hiking community meant they're likely to be as friendly and approachable as the rest of us but we hadn't yet get the chance to break the ice.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: So far the physical privations of the AT have precluded the kind of walk-and-talk that characterised my hikes on the PCT and the CDT. The cruisey terrain from Mizpah Hut meant the Dirt, Rare, Switchback and I could have the kind of wide-ranging discursive conversations. It's something I've definitely missed, but I hope the easier terrain marked by end of the White Mountains in a few days will allow that kind of hiking to take place here.","Mizpah Hut

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572335,"""Welcome to Zealand!"" 

How could I resist that? Ever since I started reading trailjournals more than 10 years ago when I was still living in New Zealand, references in AT accounts to Zealand Falls prompted a vow to visit it one day if I ever did the AT.

(Full disclosure: reading triple crowners' journals is what led me to hike the PCT back in 2006 because I concluded that, and I quote, ""the AT sounds like it sucks!"")

Today was the day, once I'd been shuttled from Gorman to Crawford Notch by Bruce, a former thru-hiker from Louisiana who spent the summers in the area driving hikers in return for gas money and tips.

After a short climb up from the road, the trail began a long traverse across a plateau near Ethan Pond shelter and then turned into a superhighway by following what was clearly an old timber tote road along the side of the valley.

The speed of the trail was counterbalanced by my prediction for talking to everyone I encountered on the trail, which at the turnoff to the pond included Poppa, a 60-year-old hiker we'd first met in Baxter State Park on June 6 and had been leapfrogging ever since.

Seeing him was doubly good because I'd heard nothing about Poppa since the start of the Mahoosucs and I was wondering if his hitherto miraculous ability to get through everything the trail could throw at him might have met its natural limit, by using the familiar principles from the parable of the tortoise and the hare. 

I should have had more faith that age and cunning would beat youth and strength!

Zealand Falls Hut was accessible from possibly the easiest route to any of the AMC huts -- a two-mile mostly level hike -- which on this pleasant sunny day meant it was overrun by day trippers.

This in turn meant the handful of hut staff -- the usual college-aged kid and a much older guy who seemed to be a volunteer -- didn't have time to do much else than to tend to the visitors' needs.

As soon as I pushed on after lunch on the ascent to Mt Zealand, however, the trail was almost exclusively populated by thru-hikers.

One of the factors about the Whites had been the high quality trails, especially compared to the sketchy parts of the Mahoosucs. But that generalisation clearly had a limit, and that limit was encountered on the route to Galehead Hut, where the usual mix of mud, rocks and roots held sway.

I was slowly making my way down the street ridge to the saddle where the hut was located when a hiker stressed only on his underwear came bounding to the trail towards me.

Knots -- named for his dreadlocks, although others said he was calling himself Tangles -- explained he was attempting the unsupported speed record for the AT, which Heather ""Anish"" Anderson had held since 2015. He was currently two days ahead of schedule, having left Springer Mountain a scarily short 43 days ago. That was nothing compared to his plan to complete the hike to Katahdin in eight days. Eight days!

Even more impressive was his friendliness and willingness to chat, despite his 44-mile-per-day schedule. He reminded me of Scott Williamson, the PCT yoyoer who I met in the streets and then again on Cascade locks on his journey back south.

I wished him well and completed the hike to Galehead Hut, arriving just before a squall came through with a short but intense phase of fat raindrops.

This hut had a particular reputation for not being hiker friendly, but what I found was the exact opposite. Jude and Beast were in situ and had grabbed the two work-for-stay places but the croo were happy to take more. 

Even when Poppa rolled up around 8pm, he was offered a place in the floor but not asked to do any work since they couldn't guarantee him food. But there was plenty of food to go around and we made sure he didn't go to bed hungry, like a naughty schoolboy.

The only other excitement of the evening was a team of hikers who arrived at 9pm, by headlight, having taken far longer than they expected to come over via Franconia Ridge.

This is pretty much the exact same route we're doing in reverse tomorrow, but hopefully without similar consequences.

Now we're settling down on the floor with our bellies full to bursting. Life is good.

AT fact of the day: One of the downsides of sobo hiking is that Franconia Ridge -- the last of the three above-treeline stretches for which good weather is needed -- comes at the very end of this 28-mile section. After predicting mostly good weather, the forecast now is for afternoon thunderstorms tomorrow. But will this force me off the ridge, or will it prove to be yet another false warning about weather in this part of the country?","Gorham
",Galehead Hut,"Jul 09, Sun",14.70
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572336,"Is this the trail, or it a waterfall?

It turns out to be a trick question. The trail is a waterfall. Or maybe the waterfall is the trail? That's a zen question I'll leave to others.

The slow progress of the previous evening's Franconia Ridge party, who arrived at the hut a full hour after dark, was beginning to make more sense.

For us, the slow progress involved a more pressing issue. We're heading towards Franconia Ridge -- the third and last place on the AT where good weather really is important -- and one recent forecast suggested there might be a thunderstorm coming in around 11am.

At more than 5000ft, that's not a good place to be -- unless you're Frankenstein's monster and you're in need of a jump-start. But equally, the experience of the past six weeks or so has prompted us to take forecasts with a grain of salt.

After scaling the trail/waterfall/traifall/waterail, the view from the top of Mt Garfield showed the entire Franconia Ridge to be clear and without any sign of angry black clouds bearing down on it to spoil the party.

One sweaty hour later, I've covered the ground to the spot where the ridge emerges from the treeline. It's 10am and, like on the Presidentials, the weather's still nice enough to wear nothing more than shorts and a thermal top. I'm both lucky and grateful.

The trail path here reflected one of the fights between the AMC, the mountain club that maintains this part of the AT, and the US Forest Service, which controls the land it sits on. The USFS took a somewhat laissez faire response, deciding that the proliferation of social trails was a lesser evil than the obvious rock-lined route the AMC favoured as a way to keep people on the One True Path. The AMC clearly won this round.

After half an hour, I was standing on top of Mt Lafayette, where there are maybe 30 other day hikers milling around in blustery but still warm weather.

The views in every direction are impressive, including showing that Mt Washington is clear once again, but my favourite sight is the newly-revealed one of the trail undulating along the ridge over Mt Lincoln and Mt Haystack towards Mt Liberty and Mt Flume. This is my destiny.

After the Haystack, the trail headed into the bushline and then shortly before Mt Liberty, the AT heads off the ridge to Liberty Springs campsite before heading down 4000ft or so down to the highway at Franconia Notch.

I grabbed some water at the spring, where there was an Australian woman from Melbourne running a summer camp hike for a bunch of kids. She in turn told her young charges about thru-hiking and presented me as Exhibit A of this obscure but colourful subspecies.

The descent was steep but efficient, and I took it slowly, putting as much weight as possible on my hiking poles, until I emerged at a tarmac bike path running alongside the river.

This was my bonus mile: I'd arranged to be collected by The Notch Hostel at 5.30pm but the closest place on the trail they can do that in a car is the Flume Visitor Centre, 0.9 miles down the bike path. Doing this final mile on a sealed surface was not quite my ideal way to end the day but I emerged into the car park and wandered over to the visitor centre with half an hour to spare and at exactly 5.30pm, the van arrived and I was soon headed to North Woodstock, six miles away,

Soon I'd dealt with the chores -- shower, laundry, food -- and was able to chill among lots of familiar faces and a few new ones from the nobo crowd.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: After my recent concerning need for Vitamin I, as the anti-inflammatory ibruprofen is known in the hiking world, I've been trying to get through the Whites while also scaling back on my use of it.

I'll find out whether this was wise or foolish tomorrow...","Galehead Hut
",North Woodstock,"Jul 10, Mon",14
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572337,"Based on the forecast, I was supposed to be hiking in bucketing rain. Instead, I basked in the sun. 

After yesterday's crossing of Franconia Ridge in unusually benign conditions, I was prepared for -- and resigned to -- a far less enjoyable but still feasible crossing of the Kinsman range.

When the forecast proved to be just plain wrong, that was obviously fine by me, but later I heard of others who believed the forecasts and opted to stay in town. One of them said the forecast had prompted her to remain in the valley, where she watched as the clouds mostly lifted and blue skies reigned in the place of the predicted rain showers.

The decision to try the range was made easier by the slackpacking option offered by The Notch, which not only meant I could carry a light pack but also hike in the nominally easier northbound direction.

Bookie, a former AT thru-hiker who now helps run The Notch, dropped me off at Kinsman Notch parking area around 7.40am and helpfully pointed me in the correct direction. 

It helped that the excellent trail tread we'd encountered throughout the Whites continued, making the steady climb towards Mt Wolf a matter of steadily plugging away upwards rather than the rhythm-destroying scrambling up cliffs that had characterised so much of the AT north of here.

The first people I met on the trail were a North Carolina couple who assured me that the trail in their state was far nicer again, the result of ""100 retired people"" from the relevant section outdoing each other to ensure it was properly maintained.

I didn't meet anyone else until I reached Eliza Brook lean to, where I found Spiffy and Littlefoot in situ.

There was also an odd Lebanese-Canadian guy there who'd twisted his foot while hiking the day before and had opted to hike on to the shelter. His ankle was grossly swollen, which made his decision to continue to pretty much the exact middle of the section and the furthest place from the road seem more than a little odd.

But that was nothing compared to his rich seam of conspiracy theories, headed by the one in which the Saudis and Israel had conspired to do 9/11. ""The proof,"" he said, ""is incontrovertible!""

I didn't have the energy to point out the gaping holes in his logic and instead decided a 2000ft climb to South Kinsman was a much more appealing option.

The appeal of this was definitely comparative because the trail took a direct line up beside a series of waterfalls and swimming holes.

Near the top of this, I ran into Poppa, who was heading southbound after doing work-for-stay at Lonesome Lake AMC hut. He was saying his sore knees were hindering his progress today.

""It's nothing worse than this further down,"" I said, gesturing to the path I'd just climbed.

""It gets worse ahead for you,"" he replied. ""There are four or five areas where you need to scramble.""

And he was right. There was nothing insuperable, and it lacked either the outright sketchiness of the Mahoosucs or the enjoyment factor of Mahoosuc Notch, but it certainly slowed progress until I finally emerged at the edge of the treeline on the summit of South Kinsman.

The scrambles were part of the reason why nobo is an easier way to tackle this section, and after that the trail was straightforward over North Kinsman and then down the steep but easy slopes towards Lonesome Lake hut.

The hut was in a great lakeside location and as I dropped in to refill my water bottles, I found they still had coconut and blueberry porridge left over from the morning which was being offered for free.

That fuelled me down the fast and easy trail back down to Franconia Notch, where even with another encounter with the ""bonus mile"" to the Flume visitor centre, I was out at the entirely civilised hour of 6pm.

It only took a few minutes to get a lift down to Lincoln with a local ski bum who was heading out on a mountain run with his dog and gave me the gen on the best places to eat.

I then rang Bookie, who arranged an ice cream run in the hostel van as an excuse to pick me up. Six of us ended up eating Udderly Delicious ice cream -- which was true to the name -- before returning to The Notch.

There's now just one more mountain section to do before the end of the Whites and on to what we're told is easier terrain. It's about time.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: I'd contemplated not doing the bonus mile and hitching from where the trail hit the highway, which would have left a gap in my continuous footprints. I opted to take the longer way and in the process of doing so met Gringo, a sobo who'd just come off Franconia Ridge, hitched into town, bought a 24-pack of PBR and a bottle of wine and was walking back up to surprise his buddies. ""Would you like a beer?"" What a great way to end the day, with a well-earned brew.","North Woodstock
",North Woodstock,"Jul 11, Tue",17.10
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573247,"Mt Moosilauke is a mountain that loomed high on our horizon, both literally and metaphorically.

The literal bit is easily explained, because it's more than 4800ft high, but the metaphorical significance is even greater, because this peak represents the END OF THE WHITES.

Until now, my primary goal had been self preservation of both body and spirit, without paying much heed to arbitrary externally-imposed schedules and deadlines.

But beyond this peak is said to be easier trail. Not easy -- this is, after all, the AT -- but easier. I'll take that.

As I'd crossed the one-fifth of the trail mark somewhere around Franconia Notch, I'd advised friends of the statistic by saying I was ""20 per cent done"", adding in a post script that my knees, however, were ""95 per cent done"".

That was a slight exaggeration, since I'd managed to get through the Whites and weaned myself off the 800mg of ibuprofen I'd been taking each day, but there was no doubting the toll this trail has taken on joints already abused through decades of extreme sports.

If the trail after Mt Moosilauke does indeed become more moderate, I'm now far more confident than before that I'll finish the AT before the AT finishes me.

All this was on my mind as I set off from The Notch hiker hostel with fellow sobos Train and Obi Wan, but of course they was the small factor that I still had to actually get over this peak before the promised land of milk, honey and easier trail would manifest itself.

My first discovery was that my companions were slackpacking over the peak, having left most of their packs' contents back at The Notch, where someone would shuttle them back from Glencliff this afternoon.

So I could have sent my pack with the shuttle, instead of carrying three days food and full equipment over a 4,802ft peak? I hadn't even realised it was an option, or I'd have jumped on it.

But I managed to keep up with them on the brutal climb up from the road, which is renowned for being one of the steepest on the entire AT, which was a little depressing for them but at least showed that my fitness levels have certainly improved over the past five or six weeks.

At the first shelter, about a mile and a half up the trail and just as the clearly glacier-carved valley walks moderated to a more reasonable angle, I met Mary Poppins, Pouffey, Rare, Hot Mess Express et al, who were also slackpacking, thanks to Squeaky, their former hiking buddy who is acting as a trail angel while he's temporarily off the trail with an injury.

Am I the only person stupid enough to be carrying a full pack over this hill? It certainly seemed that way.

Soon after, however, I ran into Poppa. He too was fully loaded but also showing his trademark tortoise-vs-hare pace by slowly plugging his way up the hill. As if previously noted, there was no variation of the hare-vs-tortoise parable that I knew of in which the hare emerges triumphant.

Another way in which Mt Moosilauke acts as a border between two segments of trail is that the route over it is now the domain of the Dartmouth Outing Club instead of the Appalachian Mountain Club.

The most obvious difference was the hand-carved signposts -- including one with a dire warning about the climb we'd just completed -- but the trail was also in good condition and even used the contours of the slope to follow an easier way to the summit instead of going straight up, as had been the apparent rule for much of the trail so far.

The top few hundred feet of the mountain were above the tree line, making me quietly thankful that the weather was no worse than a few skudding clouds that occasionally enveloped the summit. 

Much of my timing on the AT so far had featured dumb luck, with good weather on Katahdin, the Presidentials, Franconia Ridge and now here. There was a forecast for some bad weather to come in later today, by which time I'd be back down in the valley and at the famous Hikers Welcome Hostel.

From the summit, the trail headed down on tread that was some of the best we'd seen since Abol Bridge, leading us to voice our surprise that maybe the rumours we'd been hearing were true, but as the trail headed steeply down Mt Moosilauke's Eastern flank, it soon turned into the usual mix of rocks and roots to which we were all ready all-too familiar.

Then near the bottom of the hill, we tracked through a field. This rare moment of agricultural idyll was so discordant with the terrain we'd trekked across for nearly 400 miles that our immediate reaction was to wonder if we'd veered off the AT. 

We hadn't. It seemed like this was the AT now.

This developed theme continued for the next hour as we went past groomed fields, walked on a road and then headed along dream-like trail until just before Glencliff, where an unavoidable ford broke the reverie.

I recognised the ankle-deep ford as the one that someone had videoed raging in flood from the downpour as I'd first arrived in Gorham nearly two weeks before.

From there, it was the easiest of walks along the road to the hostel, where we found that it was as good as its name: Hikers Welcome.

Silence.

Then there was spontaneous laughter from the group of us arced around the TV, watching Good Will Hunting.

And to say there was silence between the sarcastic suggestion and the laughter isn't quite accurate because the rain that had been falling almost continually since last night was going through a particularly heavy shower, which is what had prompted the tongue-in-cheek suggestion.

One of the many things this deluge had dampened was hiker enthusiasm, particularly for the nobos present who'd hiked more than 1700 miles and had little interest in tackling the first big peak of the Whites when the weather was terrible.

Although Bashful (the German hiker formally known as Janine) opted to head out into the maelstrom to get her allocated daily mileage, most of the other sobos found excuses to put off our departure.

I'm a little torn by this. There's still 44 trail miles to get to Hanover, from which I was going to go into Boston on Saturday to see some expat friends who I'd met in the Middle East. Now that the trail is out of the Whites and less arduous, I'd hoped to be able to knock out two 22-mile days, or possibly slightly shorter days then stealth camping a few miles from town and hiking in early on Saturday.

The rain-delayed departure stymied those plans, although I still managed to do just under 10 miles after leaving at 2.40pm as the last remnants of showers ended. As I left, the others around the TV were just starting to watch Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring. I think it's fair to say this Fellowship of the Zero Day was going nowhere.

With an even bigger storm bearing down on the region, supposedly arriving on Saturday, I might have to hitch into Hanover from an outlying road and then find a ride back out when I return to the trail on Monday

Although the talk about the trail getting much easier after the Whites meant some of us were expecting something akin to a scenic travelator, I suspected difference would be comparative. But the first 10 miles suggested the travelator theory wasn't too far off. It was nice to be able to stretch my legs.

There were a few other hardy souls out, most of them having walked through the rain earlier. The first, however, was a slackpacking woman who had left at 2pm. She looked like the archetypal dinner lady, being grey-haired, plump and elderly. She asked if there was anything terrible ahead, such as ledges or cliffs, and I was happy to advise that it was easy hiking to the hostel, although I tried to hint that the Whites would be another story.

The rest all looked wet and bedraggled, making me feel better about my decision to wait until the rain ended. They all seemed to be just making the miles, and near Ore Hill camp ground, one delicately sidestepped the muddy bits of the path and complained how he'd never seen such a muddy route. Given that this trail would have felt like a superhighway if it'd been transposed into the middle of the Mahoosucs, I just smiled and thought about what he had to look forward to.

Around 7pm, I found an excellent campsite beside a steam. The second course of breakfast, however, will be a 2000ft climb but after the last five weeks, I can't imagine it will be too bad...

AT fact of the day: The Whites were certainly tough, but they came with compensations. I'm camping tonight and cooking for the first time since before Mahoosuc Notch, nearly two weeks ago. On every single night in between, I'd stayed in a high mountain hut or in a hostel down in the valley, eating the awesome hut food or town food instead of the provisions I was carrying.","Hikers Welcome hostel

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573249,"Not that long ago, we sobos used to pay close attention to our nobo counterparts' trail descriptions. Now I find myself paying attention again, but for the exact opposite reason.

Back when the reputed toughest parts of the AT still lay ahead, we'd listen carefully about what they had to say. But then after repeatedly finding the reality fell short of the hype, we started downplaying or even ignoring them.

I realised this process had reached full circle on the way down Smarts Mountain, when I encountered some nobos complaining earnestly about the ""tough climb"" on a section of trail that was waaaaaaaaay gentler and nicer than 90 per cent of what we'd encountered in the past month.

I said nothing and just smiled to myself, knowing that the next few weeks would put this climb in context for them. What I really liked was that it hinted that the way ahead for us would be even easier than it had been since we left the Whites.

It says something for our own benchmarking in the northern AT states that two climbs of around 2,000ft each could be deemed a relatively easy day.

It helped that the trail was relatively easy walking, at least compared to the rocks, roots, mud and steep grades we're used to. On the second climb, to Smarts Mountain, the path was remarkably gentle for sobos.

At the top, there was an old fire watchtower and associated fire warden's cabin, back from the days before these things were automated. The weather was still dry but clouds from yesterday's storm socked in the summit, rendering pointless climbing up to the tower for the view. In the cabin, I found Train and Obi Wan, along with an indeterminate nobo. 

It was near the bottom of the mountain that I started meeting a phalanx of nobos and hearing, in the midst of a steady but otherwise unremarkable ascent for them, what a ""tough climb"" it was. Just above them was more difficult terrain again, with wet sloping granite slabs and steep boulder staircases, but still a cruise compared to what we'd been through. 

Thanks to the previous day's slow start, I knew I wasn't going to get to Hanover today by trail. Having arranged to spend the weekend with friends from the Middle East now living outside Boston, it meant I'd have to hitch hike to Hanover from one of the roads the trail crossed today. It didn't take long to dismiss the idea of the road at 24 miles as too ambitious but the nobos I'd been meeting said the crossing at 20 miles, Goose Pond Road, had very little traffic. The idea of getting there sometime after 7pm and potentially getting stuck without a lift prompted me to stop hiking at Dartmouth Skiway, on a much better travelled road.

The other information from the nobos was about how hiker-friendly Hanover is. This was quickly demonstrated when I reached the road at the skiway, saw a car approaching and fumbled for my phone to try and work out which way I was supposed to be hitching to get to Lyme and then Hanover. I didn't even need to put out my thumb because the driver stopped, unbidden, to offer a lift. On the few miles to Lyme, he explaining to his daughter about the long hike the smelly stranger in the car was doing. 

From Lyme, it only took about 10 more cars before someone stopped, a ski industry engineer who dropped me off in downtown Hanover even though it was out of his way. This was definitely a hiker friendly community!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: On the insect mesh of my tent this morning, I found a large tick. It wasn't the tiny pinhead-sized deer ticks that are pernicious carriers of Lyme disease, but it's a reminder that as the terrain gets lower and easier, there will be other difficulties to take their place.","Moosilauke Lake

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573250,"One of the enticing and enjoyable parts of having worked in the Middle East is that you'll later have friends to visit all over the world. 

Jen, Yas and I had all met in Abu Dhabi, although their meeting was rather more momentous than their one with me: they were now married and had a young son, Tommy. 

And it became even more momentous in light of recent political events in the US, since Jen is a US citizen and Yas is Syrian. After a tortuous process, he received a green card during the final year of the Obama administration and he moved to the US a few months before Trump was elected. Had their timing been a year later, they might still have been stuck in Abu Dhabi.

But out of these difficult circumstances, they'd managed to settle into the US, even though Yas was finding the idea of paying tax for the first time in his life to be both unpleasant and bewildering. 

Matt, another friend from Abu Dhabi who was doing some nanotechnology research in Harvard's labs for a few months, also came down for the weekend to Jen's sprawling and pleasant family home in Hingham, on the coast east of Boston. 

This was about as establishment as it was possible to get. The town boasted the US's oldest continually operating church and Jen's family had countless previous generations buried in the local cemetery. Her parents, both Harvard-trained doctors, had a huge and magnificent mansion. It was somewhat sobering to realise their annual property taxes were more than my annual budget to live on in retirement.

They were given a crash course on the practicalities of hosting a hiker (a shower and laundry were top priorities -- in their own interest as much as mine -- and my trail runners were swiftly banished to the furthest reaches of the property). I'd mailed my hair clippers here, which turned me from a hairy bearded hiker into something slightly more respectable, with a midway point involving a mohawk. 

The weekend was mostly about catching up with friends who I hadn't seen for up to a year. Yas had been in the US the longest, with it being deemed safer for Jen to return briefly to Abu Dhabi to pack up their life in case there was a sudden change of policy that could strand him on the other side of the world.

I returned to Hanover feeling reinvigorated by a weekend away from the trail and among friends. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The hitch hiking was not the only way in which Hanover is hiker friendly. Because this is the home of Dartmouth, an ivy league school, accommodation is expensive but there is a phalanx of trail angels who take hikers into their homes. One of them is Greg, who hosts two hikers a night at his historic home in the outlying village of Wilding, just outside Hanover.","Hanover
","Hingham, Massachusetts","Jul 15, Sat",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573251,"Ever since we left behind Mt Moosilauke, we're continuing to find signs that the trail really has changed character. 

One example later in today's hike was when the trail came up to a series of ancient glacier-scoured bedrock ledges from when this area was under the Laurentide Ice Sheet until 20,000 years ago.

But instead of the trail going straight up the ledge, as it had done so often in Maine, it meandered around them using natural ledges to find a relatively gentle route. This was yet another revelation that I was happy to discover. 

Earlier on our hike, we'd be able to tell we were getting closer to civilisation by hearing traffic -- sometimes from up to five miles before we actually crossed the highway we'd been hearing.

That was the case here but since Hanover was the first major town through which the trail goes, we also had sightings of buildings through the trees to show we were getting close to the urban area.

Soon I was stepping out of the forest and onto a sporting field that will be familiar to anyone who read A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson's 1998 book about the AT that caused the number of wannabe thru-hikers to soar. Soon after moving to Hanover, he found himself bemused by the presence of a path that led into the woods and went all the way to Katahdin. That sight prompted him to try to hike the trail. It was where I stood now.

I'd expected to have to hike today's section in reverse, since that would allow me to leave most of my pack's contents at the Dartmouth Outing Club's huge offices and slackpack the 17 miles. But with impressive act of generosity, Greg offered to drive me to Dartmouth Skiway so I continue from where I left off and walk back to town.

Now that I'd reached town, yet another sign of the changed nature of this trail was that the white blazes were now marked on streetlight poles through the most urban and pleasant of environments. Instead of going past hillocks and swamps, I hiked past cafes, pubs and restaurants. In both cases, I was able to acquire tannin-hued liquids, but I prefer the ones that taste of hops rather than swampwater.

Life is good.

",Hanover,"Jul 17, Mon",17.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573252,"Trail magic is defined as the little acts of kindness -- a meal, a cold soda or an offer of accommodation -- provided to hikers from previous hikers or just those in the community who want to do something to make the hiking life a little less burdensome. 

(""Trail tragic"" is the corresponding term when you encounter a cooler to find the hikers before you have completely depleted it) 

But with the nobos outnumbering the sobos by something between 10:1 to 5:1, large scale trail magic tends to be a phenomenon in the southern states at the height of hiker season between March and May. 

Notwithstanding the remoteness of the northern AT from major population centres, I've seen my share of acts of kindness: a cosmic brownie with a piece of poetry at Piazza Rock lean to, some apples from a MATC trail maintainer on Chairback Mountain, and a PB&J sandwich from a trail crew in the 100 mile wilderness, to name but a few.

Today put all that into perspective, with an array of trail magic that was vast and humbling, ending with an act of kindness orchestrated from, of all places, Abu Dhabi.

It began with breakfast at Lou's, an old school diner on Hanover's main street. 

""Are you a hiker?"" the waitress asked. ""You get a free donut!""

A young woman from a group of college kids sitting at the neighbouring table looked a little shocked, until I explained what was involved to qualify for this act of largesse.

The breakfast -- a pesto omlette, with home fries and buckets of coffee -- was exactly what I needed to start the day right.

The trail then headed out of town on a sealed road, across the river separating New Hampshire from Vermont, and up through Norwich. At the start of Norwich, there was a cooler marked ""Trail magic"", containing sodas and chocolate brownies. Even better, the people from the house were just emerging, so I had the chance to thank them in person for their generosity.

As I turned onto Elm Street, in the space of half a mile there was a picnic table for hikers to rest, followed a few hundred yards later by a cooler of sodas and fruit (temporarily maintained by Greg while the owners of the property were hiking in the French Alps) and finally another ice-filled cooler with sodas near where the trail returned to the forest. 

Elm Street might be the setting for a famous cinematic nightmare, but for hikers it's definitely not the one in Norwich, Vermont, unless their personal nightmare revolves around being delayed in making their miles. 

The trail tread itself was a further kind of trail magic, being flat and fast despite following a ridgeline. The nobos' description of Vermont being rolling hills was one description which was proving to be true.

The 10 miles to White River bridge was the fastest I'd travelled since the cruisy trail from Baxter State park to Abol Bridge, but progress there came to a halt in the form of Randy, a resident sitting on his porch offering cold sodas to every hiker that came past. Once enticed onto his porch, he encouraged everyone to jump from the bridge into the river. Most people did.

Since I'd announced my plan to hike the AT, Anna, a Vermont woman I knew because she works at NYU Abu Dhabi, had said the trail went within half a mile of her childhood home. Although she'd been home in Pomfret a few weeks earlier, she'd since returned to Abu Dhabi but after hearing I was about to enter Vermont she put me in touch with Cassidy, a childhood friend who lived just 0.2 miles from the trail and who was going hiking in New Zealand later in the year.

I'd arranged to come through in mid morning tomorrow, only to learn that Cassidy wouldn't be there. She said her husband, Pete, was renovating a house on the farm and would be happy to host me for a beer and a snack. He'd hiked the AT in 2008.

But since the trail had been so fast, I sent a message saying I was trying to get there today in the hope of catching them both and having time to chat, rather than interrupting them at work.

It was 3pm when I set off from White River Bridge but the next 10 miles of trail was nearly as fast as the first 10 had been and sometime around 7pm, I emerged onto Totman Hill Road and walked up to the farm.

I was lucky that Pete is a bit of a workaholic -- he was turning an old maple syrup boiling shed into a home for him and Cassidy so they could split their time between living there and travelling the world -- because he was still at the farm when I arrived, instead of having driven back to his home down the valley. Given he hadn't received the message that I was arriving early, he greeted me with a warm welcome -- and beer. He then drove home to feed his cat before returning to the farm for the evening to host me.

It turned out the AT was just the tip of his hiking accomplishments and he was a triple crowner.

It was well past hiker midnight before I crashed out in a spare bedroom. The balance between pain and pleasure on the AT has certainly taken a turn for the better in the last couple of days.

Life is good, but particularly when it is a day like today.

AT fact of the day: It didn't take long for Pete and I to work out we had several friends in common, such as Grants NM trail angels Hugo and Carole Munn. The hiking world is indeed a small place when it comes down to it.","Hanover

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573253,"One benefit of swimming against the tide on the AT is the way nobos bring details about the good things ahead for us on the trail.

I suspect this is a taste of things to come as we get to more populated parts of the trail. I'd already heard about the ""deli blazing"" part of the trail in New York, where you pass stores offering fine food several times a day. It'll make a change from Clif bars and their variants.

Today was a perfect example of that. I'd been telling nobos about the increasing crescendo of trail magic as they approached Hanover and in turn nearly every one told me about the On The Edge farm produce shop, just off Route 12.

I'd heard so much about this that I deliberately lingered this morning to make sure I didn't arrive before the shop opened at 10am. In truth, Cassidy's parents' home was such a little slice of bucolic paradise that it was difficult to leave. When I did, Pete was already into the midst of one of his 12-hour working days, turning the shed into what will be an awesome home. Both the enthusiasm and long hours reminded me of renovating my own 120-year-old wooden house in New Zealand.

This section of trail is one of the AT's many linking sections, connecting the high mountains of the Whites to the Green Mountains in mid-Vermont that form the basis of the Long Trail, a 270-mile footpath that predated and then inspired the creation of the much longer Appalachian Trail. What that meant for me was I was crossing the grain of the country, rather than following along ridgelines.

Even with the ups and downs -- distinctly moderate, after the kind we found in Maine and New Hampshire -- the trail remained fast and I emerged onto Route 12 a little after 10am and immediately turned right to hike the 0.2 miles to the On The Edge farm produce shop.

A few minutes later, I was scoffing a blackberry and peach pie that was still warm from the oven. It was as good as it sounded and I remember thinking that if the rest of the trail was like this, it's going to take me until sometime next year to finish this trail. 

I grabbed a blueberry muffin for the road and headed on, beginning a gentle five-mile climb back up to the crest of the mountain range at The Lookout, where a local farming family had built a simple cabin with a viewing platform on top. They generously left it open for hikers to use, and it was understandably more popular than the official AT lean to a little way below even though there was no water.

I'd wanted to get to Killington Village early tomorrow, for reasons to be revealed soon, so I pushed on to Stony Brook lean to for the night. 

Yet another one of the snippets of trail news the nobos had proffered had been the presence of a problem bear at the lean to only five days before. It was reportedly bold but not aggressive, which made an unwelcome change from the skittish bears we'd seen in hunting areas.

Once I arrived, there were more notes about the bear, although there were no reports of it in the past few days. The advice -- to use the lean to's broom to shoo it away -- required a degree of confidence and/or bravery I didn't possess. 

Usually I'd camp away from the shelter but tonight I'm camping right next to it. There are about a dozen people here, so I figure there's at least an even chance someone else will be attacked before me.

I figure, the odds are good... and so is life.

AT fact of the day: As I approached the shelter, I met an Israeli hiker. He got on the trail the previous year but was overtaken by winter so went to Patagonia for the southern summer. Now that he's back on the trail, and for the final 500 miles or so he's been joined by his parents. ""Shvilistim!"" I said, causing them to react with surprise that I knew the Hebrew word for ""hikers"", leading to me swapping tales about the Israel Trail.","Totman Hill Road

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573255,"Getting back on the trail after a couple of days off and having done just 70-odd miles in the last nine days, I expected all the people I knew to be way ahead.

This expectation was reinforced while reprovisioning at the Killington Deli, where I saw some fit and clearly seasoned hikers and asked if they were nobos.

""No, we're sobos,"" they said, explaining that they'd summited Katahdin on June 20 -- more than two weeks after me.

But then after a couple of hours of hiking up towards Killington Peak, just as I was expecting to have to get to know this new band of sobos, I ran into the familiar faces of Rare, Mary Poppins and Pouffey. They were being slackpacked around by Squeaky, whose hip ailment was still keeping him off the trail.

He expected to be back on trail soon but in the meantime, he'd flown to Kentucky, got in his truck with his 15 year old daughter Mamie and dog Percy then driven back up to help his tramily -- a portmanteau of ""trail family"" -- and any other hiker who happened to be around.

The trail didn't go over the peak of Killington, which was just as well since it had a gondola station and an expensive restaurant rather than a wilderness experience. I opted not to go for the side trail and continued onwards.

The biggest change was the nobos I was meeting, nearly all of whom were among the happiest I'd seen yet and a stark contrast from the dead-eyed speedsters we'd met in Maine. 

This might have reflected the easy trail, considering there was a climb of more than 2,000ft, but also the fact that nearly everyone I met was slackpacking.

With one short exception where the trail did a descending traverse across a steepish slope, the trend of fast progress increased as we got lower on the mountain and then into rolling hills where the trail had been repositioned after the damage caused by Hurrican Irene a few years earlier. 

Just before we hit Upper Cold River Road, there was a post on a tree positioned for nobos, saying: ""Katahdin 500 miles"". It was nice to have recognition that we were actually making progress, even if the last few days had been particularly leisurely. I considered that time to be recovery from the privations of Maine and New Hampshire, with a view to increasing my mileage.

After I'd farewelled my companion of the last couple of days as she headed off on travels from New York to Cuba and then on to Sweden to start her new job, I headed off at 10.30am and didn't think I'd manage any more than 15 miles. But that recovery time must have been doing me good because I felt energised by the time off and the easy trail, so I opted to aim for Clarendon Shelter. In truth, I could have pushed on to Route 103 at Clarendon Gorge, making 20.2 miles for the day, but the appeal of camping with Poppins, Squeaky and co prompted me to stop early.

Shortly after the 500 mile marker, we crossed Upper Cold River Road, where Squeaky was waiting with cold sodas and beer. As everyone arrived, we checked the maps and worked out that Squeaky and Mamie could walk back in the 1.1 miles to Clarendon lean to and join us for the night.

The others repacked their packs with the stuff they'd left with Squeaky then we hiked on the five easy miles to the lean to. 

Barely a mile into this I saw a familiar face hiking towards me.

""Are you... Voyageur?""

He was. He'd hiked the PCT in 2007, when I resupplied Scout and Frodo, and then the CDT in 2010, when I'd hiked it. Now he was on the AT, where he was just over 500 miles away from completing his double triple-crown: having hiked the three main trails twice. I know of only one triple triple-crowner -- Lint -- but knew a few other double triple-crowners.

Particularly after the last few days, it was good to be around people I knew. 

Life is good. Particularly since I packed in a cold beer from Squeaky's stash for the five miles to camp.

AT fact of the day: Mamie's enthusiasm for hiking has been somewhat coloured by her first day ascent of Moosilauke. But I heard today that she'd been talked into slackpacking Killington Peak by telling her it was eight miles to Upper Cold River Road, when the reality was it was 12 miles. The look on her face when they announced the truth at camp was truly priceless.","Killington

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573277,"""Damn this flat trail!""

That was not a comment I ever expected to hear from someone who'd hiked across Maine and New Hampshire, but on a cold wet day Pouffey was hoping for a hill to help warm her up after stopping for too long at Minerva Hinchey lean to. 

At that exact moment the trail decided to be flat and easy . We'd have salivated over this weeks before, but it wasn't doing much to improve any of our body core temperatures.

Eventually our route headed up Bear Mountain at an angle sufficient to warm us up. So far I'd mostly avoiding walking on rainy days, but being entirely within the tree line meant there was no safety reason not to hike through the drizzle. And, in truth, it was just nuisance drizzle rather than anything serious. 

We also had the benefit of Squeaky supporting us at each road crossing, although this was not as appealing as the previous day because the conditions were such that we wanted to have the safety options provided by carrying a full pack.

The rain started around 6.30am or so, late enough for me to take down my tent before more than a few drops got through the overhanging trees, but such was the well-developed sense of slothfulness of this group that we didn't start hiking for another two hours. This was a stark contrast to the 6am starts I'd heard they'd been doing back in the 100 mile wilderness. 

We reached the road, where Squeaky had parked his car and loitered around under the scant shelter of a trail sign. Suddenly the cold sodas didn't sound quite so appealing.

Then a car pulled in and some familiarly skinny-looking young guys jumped out. 

""Are you hikers?"" one of them asked. ""Do you want a soda?""

""Um, we've got sodas here,"" I replied, trying and failing not to sound ungracious and overentitled.

""What about Honeybuns? We have Honeybuns!""

""Oh, in that case..."" and we headed over.

The main guy was called Two Socks. He'd thru-hiked the AT last year and had just done the Long Trail this year with his buddy, whose trail name seemed to be My Friends, and on their way back home they were dispensing as much trail magic as they could at every road crossing of the AT.

The irony of having two lots of trail magic at the same time was not lost on us, nor was the fact that there was little enthusiasm to head into the hills. But having done just 1.1 miles by 9.30am, we eventually found the enthusiasm to continue.

The trail down and across Clarendon Gorge was particularly scenic and the climb up the ridge on the far side was enough to keep us warm, until we stopped at the shelter 2.6 miles in. As usual, Poppins and Pouffey hiked at a pace I couldn't begin to match but they then matched that with breaks that were far longer than I usually took. Particularly on a wet day, and particularly since Poppins didn't wear a rain jacket, Pouffey was wearing a windbreaker rather than GoreTex and Rare was clad in FroggTogs, the $20 WalMart classics chosen by all cash-strapped hikers.

This was when Pouffey cursed the flat easy trail and we slogged through steady drizzle for another 3.6 miles to the next crossing, where Squeaky was waiting for us. This time he'd augmented his cold sodas with a grande meal of Taco Bell burritos, which he was generous to dole out to us. 

Rare was clearly feeling the cold and immediately hopped in the back seat. Pouffey and Poppins, who'd got there before me, were sheltering under umbrellas. Rare talked about ""being OK"" with heading back to Rutland to shelter from the rain and I began suspecting this was likely to be the end of onward movement for them for the day.

Even clad in proper gear, I was chilling off so headed on, wondering if I'd see them again today. Since I was fully self contained, it didn't really matter either way, although I'd enjoyed my time hiking with them.

I stopped at a stream crossing, where some soul with excess energy on a presumably less-unpleasant day had stacked rocks into artistic pillars, and when the rocket-walkers of Poppins and Pouffey didn't catch me there, I was pretty sure I was on my own for the day.

The rain was scheduled to continue through until lunchtime the following day, which might have played a part in the others' decision, but it began easing off and then stopped. By then, my clothes were damp but I'm used to this from Kiwi tramping so I knew it was well within acceptable limits. I was very glad not to be wearing FroggTogs in this.

Little Rock lean to was a paid site with a sumptuous porch. With the Long Trail walkers, who tended not to have their mountain skills as well honed as the AT hikers, there were twice as many people aiming to sleep in its shelter as there was room, which made for an awkward tenor. Among those who had called it a day early on were Sweets and Boss, who I hadn't seen since the Wildcats, at the start of the Whites.

I pushed on, in part because hiking would help my clothing dry out. Once more, it was easy trail using an apparent old logging road to the next highway, where the absence of Squeaky finally confirmed their decision, and then three miles in to Lost Pond lean to. I was surprised to find it entirely empty on such a dismal day, but I certainly wasn't complaining because I wouldn't need to pitch my tent. Part of the reason I suspect was the profusion of shelters on this part of the trail, with four in the space of a little over 10 miles.

Life is good.
AT fact of the day: I'm less than 15 miles out from the road into Manchester, where I'm told by the nobos there is a particularly good hiker hostel.

I'd bought these in Oregon on the PCT in 2006 and they'd done the whole of the CDT in 2010 as well as all kinds of adventures in between: a trip to Antarctica, a series of trail ultramarathons and ascents of two of the seven summits, to name but a few.

I'd heard that there was an outfitter in Manchester that specialised in insoles, so today I rocked my way down the trail to make sure I got there before they shut. 

But it turns out that Manchester is the first town I've encountered on the AT within the invisible boundary of being in the New York money zone. What that meant was this was an outfitter for people who want to look like they go hiking rather than those who actually do.

In turn, that meant the woman who served me was rather shocked by my on-trail appearance, complete with fetid shoes and lower legs still liberally caked in mud.

""I'm used to people, um, rinsing themselves off first,"" she stammered before finally getting a back room guy to fit new insoles. She refused to even touch my shoes during this process. To be fair, it isn't something I would have done in her place either.

With that task completed, I returned to the usual town chores of eating and resupplying for the next 60-mile section to Massachusetts, having got through the 52-mile leg from Killington far more easily than any similar section since starting the AT at Katahdin.

The hike today had involved some steady climbs on trail that was more frequently comprised of rocks and roots than the duff that's becoming increasingly common. The low cloud that hung around rendered academic any potential views along the way so it was easy to push the miles.

The last climb of the day ended with skirting the top of Bromley ski area, where the ski patrollers' warming hut was somewhat generously left open to hikers.

I took a break there before heading down to the road to Manchester, just a couple of miles away. A couple of northbounders came in while I was signing the register, asking: ""Any trail magic?"" I told them there was a warm and dry place to take a break but that didn't cut any ice with this over-entitled pair, who snorted dismissively and left without an extra word.

This was the downside of all the help that hikers get from random strangers. I try to be grateful for anything that comes my way, but clearly not all hikers think that way.

I was still mulling over this when the trail emerged onto the highway and the very first car pulled over when I stuck my thumb out. She asked where I wanted to go in town and took me straight to the outfitter. All the while, I tried to be the exact opposite of the nobo pair by thanking her for her kindness and apologising for my hiker aroma.

Hmmmm. Maybe I should have washed before I went into that outfitter...

Life is good, although the traumatised shop attendant might not agree...

AT fact of the day: At Peru Peak lean to, I met a mother organising a gaggle of half a dozen kids on a hike of the Long Trail. After the kids left and she did a final check of things possibly left behind, I commiserated with the burden she was putting on herself and she seemed genuinely grateful to have her efforts recognised. When I said how this was making a positive difference by having them experience the world directly rather than through a PlayStation, she looked like she was about to cry in gratitude.","Lost Pond lean to

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573948,"""Vermud"" is the AT hikers' nickname for Vermont, we were told by nobos again and again and again. And again. And again and again. 

Mostly we've been ignoring nobos' prognostications about the trail since their dire warnings have usually proved to be dramatically over-hyped, particularly when set against our experiences in Maine and New Hampshire.

But for the final three or four miles into Story Spring lean to, it seemed that maybe there was some veracity to their claims. There was deep mud that required some low-level quagmire gymnastics to bypass.

One nobo I'd spoken to earlier had talked with genuine outrage about how with one misstep ""the mud came over the top of my shoe"". It was hard to take seriously -- particularly when one of those he was telling this to was Littlefoot, who'd gone up to her waist in a bog in Maine -- but based on this his complaint might have had some basis of truth.

The main difficulty of the mud was that it destroyed the ability to set a walking rhythm, a bit like the way post holing does on snow. But unlike on snow, where the use of snowshoes or crampons can allow normal rhythms to return, they was no such panacea available to us.

We'd been told that the last 50 miles of Vermont had mud like this, which was not a cheerful prospect.*

The mud might also have been made a little worse by the light drizzle that set in sometime around lunchtime. This had been well forecast and was only supposed to last one day, which helped explain why I was the only person who left the Green Mountain Lodge that morning, with all the others opting for a zero.

I was hiking by 8am and was quickly passed by the four sobos -- three young women with long blonde hair and classic Nordic looks, together with a bearded guy from Texas -- I'd met in Killington a few days before, who'd shocked me by saying they'd started on June 20. 

Two of the women were wearing sandals, so I'd started referring to them as the Scandinavian Sandal Sisters but I learned later they had a far better tramily name: Three Goldilocks and the Bear.

I was moving a little slowly, with my pulled back muscle better but still not back to 100 per cent, and I'd somehow also managed to acquire a sore left hip and some kind of a strain in my right foot. This is not a kind trail to old bodies.

All these ailments improved through the day, although part of that was my decision to return to using Vitamin I. 

It also helped that the first 10 miles were fast, easy and mostly flat, with just the occasional hint of mud. This took me to Stratton Pond Shelter, another superior GMC lean to which was staffed and featured a $5 fee.

This was apparently one of the first shelters nobos encountered that charged money, which was the cause of some outrage among a few of those we met. They talked of stealth camping options to avoid paying this paltry sum, probably as a matter of pride and/or principle.

The rain had mostly stopped by now, although that was of fairly technical benefit since every time the wind blew through the trees, I'd get just as wet from the water dropping from the leaves.

They was a low-level short cut that avoided the 1500ft ascent of Stratton Mountain, which seemed like an entirely pointless exercise with the mountain socked in with cloud.

But staying on the AT was rewarded, not with any views on the top but from finally finding other kiwis on the trail. Of heard of a group of nobo kiwis on trail and had been asking random hikers where they were from. That tactic finally paid off when I met Bear Bag and then Cropduster.

They were traveling in a 10-person tramily and clearly we're enjoying themselves. It was nice to be able to talk about familiar topics with someone who understood.

I was still mulling over this when I saw what looked like a group of car campers at a campsite just before a road. It was indeed Squeaky, Pouffey, Poppins, Rare etc.

As expected they'd opted for a hotel when I'd last seen them but, thanks to my unplanned zero yesterday, they'd managed to get ahead of me again.

They invited me to camp with them but I said I wanted to do a few more miles, even though the next shelter had had a series of bear encounters on recent days. I did take up Squeaky's offer of grabbing a cold beer from the cooler in the back of his truck on the way through though. Thanks, Squeaky!

So I pushed on, and into the mud that seemingly justified the nobos' reports of ""Vermud"".

The shelter was really busy -- we're firmly in the midst of a big nobo bubble, although we keep getting reports of an even bigger one making its way through New York state -- but I found a campsite nearby and was glad that newly installed bear boxes meant my food was safe. 

Hopefully I would be too!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The top of Stratton Mountain was clearly a place for visionaries. It was from the top of this peak that the idea for The Long Trail, running the length of Vermont, was conceived. That in turn led directly to the bolder plan for the AT, running all the way down to Georgia. It was still a place for visionaries when I was there -- you needed a sense of vision to imagine the view, since the cloud meant I could barely see to the top of the fire tower.

* Spoiler alert, since I'm writing this a couple of days later: these few miles proved to be the worst we encountered, and the next two days of the hike featured mostly dry fast trail, but all the time I was thinking that we must be about to encounter something terrible. It never happened. The best sobo response came in a hut register entry from Spiffy and Littlefoot in one of the last lean tos: ""Vermont is muddy, but it's never been so muddy that you fear crossing into another dimension ruled by bog people. Thanks for that, southern Maine.""","Manchester
",Story Spring lean to,"Jul 27, Thu",21.10
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573949,"We were chatting with a nobo at Glastenbury fire tower about what each of us could expect in our respective directions. 

""For about 500 miles after Mt Greylock, there's going to be no mountains,"" he said. His intonation made it clear that this was a warning.

I'm not entirely sure what Pan and Tink, fellow sobos, thought about this but I'm guessing it was along the same lines as my own reaction: ""No mountains? That sounds pretty good to me.""

A few minutes earlier, Pan, Tink and I had been catching up after having not seen them since Hanover, at which point Tink's enthusiasm for the trail was at such a low ebb that I wondered if I'd see them again.

Almost all of us, it turned out, had slowed down or otherwise taken time off the trail on the last few weeks to recover -- bodily and/or mentally -- from New Hampshire and Maine. What that meant was that we kept running into people we thought would be at least a week ahead.

""It's like the bubble we started with has reformed,"" Pan noted.

One benefit was that, notwithstanding setbacks like the muscle I'd pulled in my back, we're in shape to start increasing our mileage.

Today, for example, was the furthest I'd covered since the flat rail-trail walking in the first week of the IAT. And this definitely wasn't rail trail terrain, although it was a far cry from the one-mile-per-hour stuff we'd been doing in the first month of the AT.

I'd expected the mud to continue as it had been in the miles before the shelter but, as presaged in yesterday's journal entry, all the tales of Vermud proved to be grossly exaggerated. I kept thinking the easy dry trail was a temporary aberration but it went on and on and on.

The only bits of trail beta from nobos that had consistently proved to be actually useful and accurate revolved around food. 

One such bit of information was that in North Adams, through which the trail went, the Papa John's pizza franchise offered half price to hikers, so the last couple of days had been with a view to arrive at lunchtime tomorrow. I was hoping that a pizza- and soda-fuelled lunch would power me up Mt Greylock, a 3,000ft ascent and reportedly the last mountain before 500 miles of nothing more than rolling hills.

What that meant today was heading to Congden Camp lean to, making a day of 23 miles. The final mile to the shelter was as muddy as the nobos' tales, but instead of being a sign of impending mudocalypse, it turned out to be yet another aberration before the return of fast easy trail. 

In any event, a combination of increasing fitness and easier trail meant this was a feasible destination, even if Pan, Tink and the Three Goldilocks and the Bear halted six miles before.

Tomorrow I'll be in a new (and easier) state, about to climb the last mountain for a month and also stuffed with discount pizza. 

Do I really need to say it? Life is good.

AT fact of the day: ""I was in the psych ward because I was thinking things and the people on TV were replying to what I was thinking. They say I have paranoid schizophrenia and when they released me from the psych ward, they told me I had to take my meds but they don't work so I stopped taking them."" Actual conversation with another occupant of the lean to tonight...","Story Spring lean to
",Congden Camp lean to,"Jul 28, Fri",23.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574297,"It's not often that I get going before 7am, and when I do it's usually to do with food. 

And I was eating within seconds of leaving the lean to. Unfortunately I was eating spiders, since the privilege of being the first on the trail each day is to break through the spider webs that industrious but ill-located arachnids build across the path of the AT.

It took nearly an hour for a nobo to appear, heralding the end of my spider buffet. He was glad to hear the way was clear all the way to Congden Camp but apologised for only having walked for 40 minutes or so since his stealth campsite. 

Fortunately others were also heading north by then and by the time I'd reached where he'd camped, other nobos were on the trail, allowing me instead to concentrate on a different prospective meal: half-price Papa John's pizza.

I'm not even entirely sure why Papa John's Pizza is such a drawcard, since there's a high chance that it'll be the same old standard bland corporate pizza purveyed by a gazillion similar franchises. The half price thing isn't exactly essential either, since I'm not just another cash-strapped hiker.

I was mulling over these points on the hike -- which, spoiler alert, proved no more muddy than most of the rest of the trail -- when some nobos approached. When I asked if they'd availed themselves of the pizza deal, they said there was trail magic at the school in North Adams, entailing burgers, sodas, fruit and... Papa John's pizzas.

""Free is better than half price,"" one of them quipped. And the school was right on trail, saving the half-mile each way side trip.

After scaling a few small hills to make it to the Vermont-Massachusetts border and the official southern terminus of the Long Trail, I wrote a brief message in the register, adding: ""Nobos: want to make a sobo laugh? Just complain about the mud of Vermont.""

Massachusetts introduced itself by having a few muddy patches that were otherwise indistinguishable from the ""Vermud"" variety, but that abruptly changed after less than a mile when the terrain turned steep and rocky -- a notable contrast to Vermont's rolling hills. These rocks turned rather more treacherous when the trail plunged down through a steep tallus slope of TV- sized rocks.

""No wonder there's no mud in Massachusetts,"" I thought to myself. ""It's hidden under all these boulders.""

But in time the slope and difficulty moderated, causing a corresponding increase in speed, and I cantered down to the spread-out township.

More nobos advised of the ongoing trail magic at the school and soon I was making my way across the grassy field to where a group of hikers and clean, city-dressed people were mulling around.

It turned out I'd chanced upon the Brigadoon of North Adams trail magic. As an awareness-raising initiative for the AT, the last Saturday of July was used to have a family hike on a local trail and then, for four hours, a grill-up was held for anyone who passed.

Usually these kinds of events are held by former hikers looking for a way to repay their karmic debt from the help they'd received. But this one was organised by Josh, a non-hiker who serves on the city council and wants to promote North Adams and to reduce any feelings of friction or lack of understanding between the locals and these strange smelly hikers who traipse through their town during the summer months.

He was the one who'd organised the Papa John's pizza deal for hikers, by negotiating with the franchisee, and he also had set up a scheme at his house, close to where nobos enter North Adams, with bicycles available for free for hikers to use to get around the spread-out town when resupplying.

Did I mention the food? There was stacks of it, including the bland corporate pizza, but the packs of fresh fruit received my full attention. Josh had been worried about ordering too much, still not yet fully adjusted to the locust-like traits of those who had walked between 600 and 1500 miles to get to this point.

The meal wound down around 3pm, and it took half an hour of digesting before I could even contemplate putting my pack back on. Once I did, I was among the first to leave, and also one of only two sobos.

Fuelled, as expected, by pizza, my goal was the top of Mt Greylock, the supposed final mountain for 500 miles. It was also home to a war memorial and a lodge built as a work project in the depression. The latter had a bunkroom for AT hikers, including the prospect of breakfast.

The ascent was made more memorable by seeing a day hiker above who tried in vain to outpace my climbing abilities with a full pack. It turned out to be Jim, one of those who'd attended the trail magic but who I hadn't spoken to. He was a triple crowner who'd managed to complete all three of the main long trails via section hiking.

He made for good company, as we discussed his various adventures, the local hiking scene and topics as diverse as the bastardisation of terms like trail magic, which originally referred to acts of incredible on-trail serendipity but now just referred to coolers of cold sodas or feeds such as the one we'd just enjoyed at the school.

Halfway to the summit, he headed back down to his car while I continued on a good but steep path along the summit ridge to the top of Mt Greylock, where I found myself surrounded by the kind of rotund tourists who'd driven up here.

The same timing that provided trail magic, a midsummer Saturday, worked against my plan to stay at the lodge's bunkroom. A wedding party from Boston, I was informed, had booked the entire lodge.

That was fine, since there were plenty of places to stealth-camp nearby. And I'd already confirmed that the lodge would be serving breakfast from 8am. Win!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Another sobo rocked up about half an hour after me. Simon was a young German guy who'd started on July 1 -- IE, nearly a month after me -- and has caught me up, having seen my entries in the hut registers getting nearer to his own.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574298,"For all the talk about how the trail has changed in terms of tread quality, steepness and general nature since leaving behind the Whites, nothing quite captures this transformation like this factoid from today: I ate breakfast at Bascom Lodge, lunch in a town called Cheshire and then dinner in another town, Dalton. 

This is the AT I'd heard so much about, of the many towns and deli-blazing. It's why I'd dubbed this journal as ""embrace the civility"" -- a weak play on words on triple-crowner Mags' famous description of the CDT: ""Embrace the brutality.""

Except until now the AT has been waaaay more brutal than the CDT ever was. But it seems that the pendulum has now swung the other way, for which my stomach -- and my knees -- are grateful.

A few nobo hikers had arrived at the lodge as I was sitting outside in the sun, waiting for the breakfast service to start. One was a mother and her 14-year-old son, who said they'd managed to eat town food every single day since Pennsylvania.

Town food and a lighter pack from not having to be self sufficient for several days at a time? Sign me up!

Breakfast was a convivial affair, although the demeanour of many of the wedding guests suggested they might have dined ""not wisely but too well"", as the famous phrase had it, the previous evening.

Fuelled by that, the trail down the hill was easy work, being mostly gradual and then with a steep but well-built drop off down to bucolic meadows and then the outskirts of town.

There was a new Dollar General a few hundred yards away where I could reprovision, along with a Dunkin Donuts associated with the gas station. 

At the latter I met a hiker called 77, who said the name came from having hiked the PCT in 1977.

""With Monte Dodge and Strider?"" I asked, and he seemed a little shocked that I knew two others from the tiny 30-odd strong Class of 77.

I explained how on my own hike of the PCT, Monte had come up to meet others in my hiking party in Goat Rocks wilderness and I'd know Strider because he used to organise the annual PCT kickoff before his recent untimely death from ALS.

For 77, his hike had been before starting university and now that he was retired, he'd decided to do the AT. This had been a bit of a mixed bag, he explained, although many of his descriptions of his nobo experience veered into being unnecessarily negative. Upper House Pond, an AMC cabin which nobos had been talking about in raptuous terms for more than a month, was ""overrated"" and he said the sobos he'd met were nearly all unfriendly etc.

Yet another change in the trail apart from the food was the arrival of consistent cellphone service, even for carriers as crappy as AT&T, and I settled into the vortex of Dunkin Donuts to send the latest batch of journal entries to Becster, my faithful transcriber based in New Zealand.

It was 3.30pm or so before I managed to extract myself, hoping that the bagels I'd been eating would power me through to Dalton before dark.

It helped that the trail was fast and easy, with gentle grades instead of ridiculous climbs. Soon I'd emerged from the forest onto the road that became one of Dalton's main thoroughfares and walked into town part a series of well-kept homes.

I'd briefly harboured the idea of hiking the three or four miles to the next lean to but the prospects of a town breakfast and a lingering dinner at the local burrito restaurant put paid to that.

Instead I arrived at dusk at the home of Tom Levardi, a local who for 37 years has been allowing AT hikers to pitch their tents on his lawn for free. Apart from water and a ""pee tree"", nothing else is offered.

There were about five or six tents already there and a few thru-hikers milling around. I was introduced to Tom, who gave me the rundown on the house rules, most of which could be summarised under the heading: ""Don't be a dick.""

I bedded down on the porch, using my mosquito headnet for the first time in weeks to keep the bugs at bay. Tom has warned me that I'm sleeping right next to where the newspaper delivery guy hurls The Berkshire Eagle at his front door between 2am and 3am.

I, in turn, have assured him I'm one of the world's heaviest sleepers and it'd be unlikely to wake me. Each of us looked a little askance at the other in making these predictions. I guess we'll find out who's right tomorrow morning.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Just like my gearing up of my schedule to get to North Adams in time for Papa John's pizza, I'd already established the next goal: Upper Goose Pond cabin, which offers bunks on a donation basis and where the hut custodian cooks free blueberry pancakes for the hikers each morning. It's a solid 20 miles or so from here so entirely doable.","Mt Greylock
",Dalton,"Jul 30, Sun",17.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574299,"The downside of the many towns the trail is now traversing is my inability to resist the vortex effect it creates. 

I was up at 6am and headed down to the breakfast place, Juice and Java, soon after it opened half an hour later for a leisurely meal of coffee and a breakfast burrito while I perused the pages of The Berkshire Eagle.

(Let the record state that in the sleep vs paper delivery argument of the previous evening, my prediction was vindicated. I woke up to find the paper at my feet with no recollection of its arrival.)

I was back at Tom's by 7.30am but he was serving coffee and cream cheese bagels to the assembled hikers and I settled in for conversation and didn't manage to extract myself until 9.20am.

That's not the ideal starting time for what turned out to be a day off nearly 22 miles, but I think I was expecting the terrain to be as easy as the previous day had been.

The trail was pretty good but not as cruisey as the day before. My pack was also a little heavier since it seemed like the good water we'd enjoyed until now was at an end so I had to carry the full complement.

It sounded like we'd swapped mountains for what I'd dubbed the four B's: bears, bugs, bad water and boring trail.

The day was broken up halfway by the Cookie Lady's home, a place about five minutes off the trail where a local couple ply hikers with cookies, allow them to raid their blueberry patch -- they have a pick-your-own farm, and traditionally sobos are asked to and provide blueberries for the Upper Goose Pond cabin caretaker's pancakes -- and water.

Nobody was home when I dropped in, so I made do with filling my water bottles, letting my feet air out on the grass and then heading on.

There was a final solid climb before the trail descended down to Interstate 90, from which it was only 1.6 miles further to Upper Goose Pond. I was feeling unexpectedly tired when I arrived despite the easier terrain -- maybe doing five days of around 20 miles was taking a toll?

Just as I arrived at the cabin, I went past a tent platform and saw Spiff and Littlefoot, hikers who'd I'd been bumping into since the start of the 100 mile wilderness but who I hadn't seen since the Whites. I'd known from the log books that they'd been a little way ahead.

It was particularly awesome to see them again, then I headed to the cabin and checked in. My grand plan of going for a swim was subsumed by a new plan of chilling in the vortex of the porch, which was set up with rocking chairs and books. This is worth all the effort of getting here, although I suspect the vortex effect will be even greater than it was in Dalton...

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The AMC runs this hut, although it's hard to reconcile this with the way the same club runs the expensive huts on the Whites. It turns out it's run by a different chapter with a different philosophy: to make it attractive to hikers through donation prices and free pancake breakfasts so hikers would stay here rather than indiscriminately camping around the lovely but fragile environment of Upper Goose Pond. It's nice to see carrots being used successfully instead of sticks.","Dalton
",Upper Goose Pond cabin,"Jul 31, Mon",21.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574300,"As dilemmas go, this was a good one to face. 

Do we linger longer in the delights of Upper Goose Pond? Or do we head off early so we can spend longer in the hot tub at Great Barrington community center, where AT hikers get a special discount?

There are 28 AT miles between the two, making it too long to be done sensibly in one day -- and particularly without missing out on the pancake breakfast. So it's two short days, but do we spend equal amounts of time at each end or do we favor one over the other?

This balance was taxing the minds of Spiff, Littlefoot and me. They'd had most of the previous day at Upper Goose Pond, having camped just six miles out then spent the afternoon paddling the free canoes around the titular pond, so they opted to leave around 10am after a leisurely breakfast.

After my relatively late arrival, I'd planned to leave at midday so I could enjoy this most pleasant of environs and go for a swim.

But then a nobo told me it was feasible to hitch in to Great Barrington from an earlier highway, Massachusetts Route 23, and then self-slackpack the nine miles in between the following day. It meant two nights in town, with all the benefits that offers, but without the cost since thru-hikers were welcome to pitch their tents in the forest behind the community center.

A few hours after leaving the pond at 11.15am, I caught up with Spiff and Littlefoot as they filtered water at a stream.

""If we do 19 miles today,"" I explained, ""we can each shower, have a hot tub session and go to the brew pub tonight for dinner.""

I didn't know it at the time but Spiff and Littlefoot had been two weeks since their last shower and a similar amount of time since doing their laundry. Part of this reflected their new philosophy of trying to avoid towns because they'd been burning through their budget faster than they'd wanted, but two weeks out here is like two months in normal life and they were hankering for cleanliness.

""So beer and a shower?"" Spiff asked. 

He then looked at Littlefoot and noted: ""I can see the gears turning...""

And with that, both of them were down for this plan.

The only downside was we were maybe 10 or 11 miles away from the highway and it was mid afternoon, which meant it was time to put some of this hard-won trail fitness to the test.

Littlefoot hauled her ass up the next slope at a pace I couldn't even begin to hope to match, so I resigned myself to panting and puffing my way up behind them. They were also similarly quick downhill, something my aging knees didn't permit me to match. It was only on the level ground that I was able to truly cope.

But that also involved the prospect of trail conversations of the kind that are common on the PCT and even most of the CDT but which the hitherto brutal grades of the AT had made impossible.

Most thru-hikers tend by nature to be interesting people, which I put down to having actively chosen not to follow the path in life that society pushes us all towards of school, job, marriage, kids and the consumerist ideal of a bigger house/boat/car.

Spiff and Littlefoot certainly fit into that category. They were interesting and thoughtful people. And I hadn't seen them since I was slackpacking through the Kinsman's, the second last mountain range in the Whites way back in the middle of New Hampshire, and we found ourselves at a shelter with a Lebanadian who expounded on how it was obvious that 9/11 was clearly a conspiracy between the Saudis and the Israelis.

Most of the trail towns we'd encountered have been hiker friendly but they explained how in Lee, a lesser-visited town just up the interstate they'd gone to the day before, they'd been glared at by most of the locals as if they were homeless vagrants. 

The terrain was not always easy but the conversations in particular helped the miles fly by. After getting some trail beta from nobos that the community center closed at 8.30pm, our chances of getting there on time gradually improved from uncertain to probable to us emerging onto Route 23 at 7.30pm.

There was an hour of light left in which we had to hitch the three or four miles into town. This can be an uncertain prospect with three people, an awkward hitching number, and we didn't know whether the citizens of Great Barrington would be hiker friendly or be like the disdainful types of Lee that Spiff and Littlefoot had endured the day before.

We needn't have worried. After about 10 cars went past without stopping, a driver of a car going the opposite direction stopped, turned around and drove us straight to the community center.

An hour later, we've showered, pitched our tents in the forest and now we're enjoying some of the best microbrews and burgers on the trail at the Harrington brewpub, a few minutes walk away from the community center. (Admittedly, it would have been funnier to pitch our tents in the dark after visiting the pub, but sometimes we make the smart decision rather than the most amusing one.)

We're also buzzing from the quintessential trail experience of setting an ambitious but unlikely goal then turning it into reality.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We might have arrived at the road half an hour earlier if not for our predilection of talking to every hiker we meet. This also provided some important trail beta but the epitome of this was running into Poppa, with whom I'd had a tortoise-vs-hare relationship ever since Baxter State Park. I'd last seen him in Glencliff as we exited the Whites but about 40 minutes after leaving Upper Goose Pond cabin, I crested a hill and saw him below. It was good to catch up.","Upper Goose Pond cabin
",Great Barrington,"Aug 01, Tue",19.60
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574541,"Thunderstorms and long-distance hiking are not often a good combination.

But there are exceptions to this rule, and one is when we got to witness this meteorological phenomenon -- and possibly the biggest downpour of the trail so far -- from the deck of an unexpectedly excellent Mexican restaurant, having completed our day's hiking several hours before.

The previous evening's luxuries of a hot shower and brewpub had already fully justified the push to get into Great Barrington. Today's sub-10 mile day was helpful after my week of roughly 20-mile days, but avoiding the downpour was just a serendipitous bonus.

As the three of us headed out this morning, the previous evening's hitching success proved to be no fluke. A woman drove us a mile past where she was headed to take us to the trail, and as she was picking us up, another car was in the process of turning around to pick us up.

The hike itself was easy enough, going up a hill behind a local ski area and then back down the far side to Route 7, the highway we were originally aiming for.

We knew the forecast was for a storm on the way and soon thunder began reverberating around, out of an incongruously blue sky. Grey clouds soon followed, as did a light drizzle that in the scheme of things was a pleasant change from the heat and humidity so we welcomed it rather than taking out our rainwear.

The final part of our route has it following the Housatonic River, a watercourse that would dominate our next week, until we were nearly out of the next state, Connecticut. We didn't know that at the time and our focus instead was on a worrying warning sign advising us not to eat fish out of the river because of PCB contamination.

All this took us to Route 7, where the hitch back to the community center was more problematic because we were now on the opposite side of town. 

But we needn't have worried. After a few minutes, a tree surgeon called Marco from Guatemala pulled over and proceeded to give us the extended tour of his favourite restaurants and bars in town.

This included visiting the booze shop (alcohol isn't sold in supermarkets in Mass) and finally to Xicohtencatl restaurant, where we were just finishing the most authentic burritos this side of Trump's wall when the huge storm rolled in. The rain was hard enough to make us move in from our seats on the verandah.

But we'd also learned that when the rain is torrential, it also tends to be short-lived, so we waited it out then walked back to our tents in the forest behind the recreation center.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The hot tub at the community center has been my goal for days. But as I headed on to use it after our nero, it turned out that it's a ""therapy pool"" rather than a classic hot tub,you and that today is the day it was closed for cleaning...","Great Barrington
",Great Barrington,"Aug 02, Wed",8.60
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574545,"Littlefoot was hauling up the hill when she let out a loud ""Eek!"" and stopped in her tracks. 

This was then followed by another ""EEK!!"" that was louder and at least an octave higher because Spiff, who was walking right behind, failed to notice her abrupt halt and ran into the back of her, pushing her forward.

And that's how I knew we'd found the rattlesnake.

We'd been told about the snake, our first, by some nobos shortly after we topped out on the northern end of Mt Bushell's summit ridge.

But they hadn't explained just how enormous it was. I'd seen dozens of rattlesnake before on the PCT but this was by far the biggest yet. It wasn't that long -- maybe a metre or so -- but its body was as thick as my forearm.

It clearly knew we were there, but this snake was so honey-badgerish that it didn't even bother to buzz us with its 14 or so rattles.

We told the next lot of nobos about this and soon learned that one couple were serious herpetophiles but -- as is the way of the universe -- were the only ones among their tramily not to have seen a rattlesnake. 

I only hope it didn't move on before they got there.

That morning, we'd opted to use Uber to get back on the trail rather than relying on a continuation of the luck that had characterised our hitching thus far in this town.

Spiff, Littlefoot and I were joined in this by Poppa, who'd rocked into town the previous evening through his steady all-day pace. Uber proved to be a good choice, costing just $9.50 for all four of us.

Our driver, Ahmad, was Pakistani but Poppa's attempt to address him in Arabic, ""Min ani balad ant?"" (""What country are you from?"") fell flat because despite the Arabic script on a religious inscription hanging from his rear vision mirror, his native language was Urdu. My own Urdu wasn't good enough for any meaningful conversation, but it turned out Ahmad had studied in eastern Ukraine -- an ethnic Russian enclave -- so using my basic Russian would have a been a better choice.

Among our goals for the day was crossing into another state, our fifth, although my goal was more ambitious than the other three: to do 21 miles into Salisbury, where I had my next set of shoes waiting for me with Vanessa, a local woman who ran a discount B&B service for hikers.

What that meant was that after watching snakes and chatting to everyone who passed and then visiting a trailside lean to for lunch, we'd covered a measly eight and a bit miles by 1.20pm -- and the first four miles were easy flat miles across the Housatonic valley as we connected the ridge we'd descended the day before to the different one that we'd follow for the rest of the day.

This meant I opted to head off on my own, hoping to make a faster pace on three other mountains traversed by the trail. 

Adding to the unknown in all this was that crossing into Connecticut also meant changing the group responsible for trail creation and maintenance. Would the Connecticut chapter of the AMC have Maine envy, opting to overcompensate for its relatively modest mountains by making the trail as difficult as possible?

The boundary between Massachusetts and Connecticut was mismarked on the ground, although the sign probably did accurately mark the administration boundary between the two volunteer groups who maintain the trail. I ran into the supposed border sign nearly a mile early, but at the actual unmarked border, it was suspiciously close to where the trail suddenly changed from easy and walkable to the kind of scrambling that we associated with the toughest bits of Maine.

Maybe the AMC really did have Maine envy? If so, this was going to be a very long five miles into Salisbury.

Fortunately, this was just a ""welcome to Connecticut"" stretch, just as the steep boulder field had welcomed us to Massachusetts less than a week earlier. I was very grateful when the trail improved to even better than it had been in Massachusetts, which was already our easiest state yet.

After making conditional plans to hike the final mile or so of road walking into town in the dark, I arrived around an hour before sunset. I located the home of Vanessa, settled in then went in search of the immediate necessities of life: food and alcohol.

The White Hart provided both, although the tone, prices and clientele also reflected that we were well within the range of weekend traffic from New York City.

I found myself sitting next to a businessman visiting his father, who lived in the town, and discussed the merits (or, in his opinion, otherwise) of peaty single malts. On the top shelf of the bar, by chance, were two of my favorite whiskies: Lagavulin and Laphroaig, both peaty malts from Islay in Scotland.

A few minutes into this, he summoned the bartender over and soon we each had a shot of each one lined up in front of us, along with the bartender's suggestion, another Islay single malt that had been deliberately de-peatified. Why on earth would any distillery do that? The fact that it came in a sky-blue bottle just deepened my suspicions.

The businessman and I failed to resolve the issue but we certainly had an amusing time discussing it. Coming after two pints of beer, I was certainly feeling no pain as I wandered back to Vanessa's home.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Vanessa is used to hiker packages arriving, but she admitted she was a little suspicious about mine. ""It sounded like it had pills on it,"" she said, shaking the package I'd sent from Boston a month earlier. ""It's actually macaroni cheese,"" I explained...","Great Barrington

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574547,"Everything you need to know about the merits of Poppa's and my own respective hiking styles can be found in this fact: he started several miles behind me and now he's camping even further in front of me. 

He's about to get off trail for a week while he travels down to Virgina to go for a hike on the AT in the Grayson Highlands with his wife and friends so he's worked out a schedule that would get him to a place where it's easy to reach a town where he can hire a car.

So, being Poppa, he's worked out three 20-mile days to reach Pawling in New York, then this morning he started around 6am and walked through until late afternoon to get his mileage.

Contrast that with my own indolent schedule, where I didn't manage to leave the warm and comfortable bed in Vanessa's home until 8am, then got on the road (which in this context is code for ""wander across the road to the cafe for a leisurely breakfast"") half an hour later.

However even I was surprised to find Poppa sitting at the exact same cafe, where he was just finishing his own breakfast.

In truth, I'd hoped to make an earlier start, mostly because there was a forecast for a thunderstorm this afternoon. But rule one of thru-hiking is to listen to your body rather than the arbitrary hiking schedule you've created, and in this case the eight days since my last full day off from hiking merited an easier start to the day.

And possibly, just possibly, the three single malts I'd drunk as part of the previous evening's peat-off with the New York businessman and the two earlier pints of beer might have also played a part...

Given Poppa's example of industriousness and early rising, I should have made my own breakfast a quick and efficient affair then hiked on. But the loveliness of the garden setting and the pleasant temperatures on this early August day had me lingering on for an hour before finally escaping the vortex of the cafe.

As I went to leave, the waitress explained that Poppa had paid my bill. This was presumably because I'd paid the Uber fare the day before, telling him, Spiff and Littlefoot to pay it forward to some other cash-strapped hiker in future rather than paying me their share of the $9.50 fare.

Midway across the seven mile leg along the ridge towards Falls Village, the next town, the skies opened and rain poured down. It had the feel of a short sharp shower, so I sheltered under a tree until the worst was past before continuing on.

Encountering nobos who were soaked to the bone soon after vindicated this call, although the first bunch remained resolutely happy despite the drenching.

It was sunny again by the time I walked into Falls Village and did a short detour to the Toymakers Cafe, which was famous on the trail for the quality of the food.

Poppa was already there, having just ordered his lunch and beating my attempt to pay back his breakfast largesse.

Soon after his lunch was served, he was back on the road by 2pm. I farewelled him, saying I'd see him down the road but would be waiting for my own burger to settle before hiking on. 

By the time I was about to escape from this latest vortex, the skies had darkened and the rumble of thunder presaged round two of the storm. It wasn't hard to stay put as a downpour followed that was as fierce as the one we'd watched from the Mexican restaurant in Great Barrington but lasted much longer. The streets were literally awash with water.

I didn't leave until 3.15pm. The plan had been for another 11 miles to a campsite Poppa said he was heading to but a series of steep climbs and descents slowed progress and by the time I reached Pine Swamp lean to, I'd have faced doing another 3.4 miles in an hour and a half, likely landing me there right on dusk.

The latest forecast was for it to rain all day tomorrow, so I was contemplating doing an on-trail nero to give my body a rest and to catch up on this journal. Doing that in my tent rather than a shelter wasn't an appealing prospect so I called the day early and headed to the lean to. 

It's no wonder every known version of the tortoise-vs-hare parable ends with a tortoise victory! But I'm ok with this. My goal is to have fun out here rather than relentlessly pounding the miles, and flatter terrain ahead on the mid-Atlantic states should allow me to make up for today's hydrophobic indolence...

Bashful, who I hadn't seen since my post-Whites slowdown in the middle of Vermont, was the only person at the lean to, although other nobos wandered in over the next hour and a half. She said she'd been walking alone for a long time, seemingly between the various sobo bubbles.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The early bird doesn't just get the worm -- or, in this case, more miles -- but also sees more wildlife. Poppa saw six moose in Maine and New Hampshire, while lots of people didn't see any. This morning he encountered a momma bear and two cubs as he was leaving Riga lean to.","Salisbury

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574548,"When some nobos asked me what the trail was like in the bit of Connecticut I'd already done, I said the immediate analogy that came to mind was ballroom dancing. 

Some of them looked a little puzzled, so I added: ""It's like quick-slow-quick-quick-slow.""

Today particularly exemplified this, with five of the easiest miles on the entire AT bookended by some of the toughest miles since we left the big mountains behind. All this means it's hard to make any kind of sensible prediction for how far one might be able to hike on any given day.

There were other factors at play personally too, and this morning I'd expected to make a late start, using the forecast half-day of rain to rest and catch up on this journal. 

The decision to stay in the shelter was rewarded when rain began to fall soon after dawn. Soon it was falling heavily, prompting some of the campers nearby to take shelter within.

But an hour later, it seemed to have blown itself out. An updated weather forecast -- thanks to the newfound internet connectivity in the lower New England states -- showed that it had indeed been one short sharp storm rather than the all-day drizzle that had been predicted.

I was good with that, because it meant I could head on and crank some miles, even though the idea of a rest after averaging nearly 20 miles a day for more than a week also held undoubted appeal.

The decision not to have headed on the previous evening proved to be the right one because the next section of trail were some of the slow-steps of the ballroom dancing analogy and, based on my time this morning, it seemed I'd have struggled to arrive before dark.

But maybe that pace also reflected the time since my last true zero day? For some of the climbs that followed, it definitely felt a little like I was running on empty.

This was particularly the case for the ascent of Silver Hill, which had a campsite on the far side featuring a roofed pavilion, which had originally been a potential goal for the previous evening before I succumbed to the serial food vortexes of Salisbury and Falls Village.

This was one of the enervating climbs that bookended the easiest five miles yet of the AT, where it followed along the now-substantial Housatonic River. The break -- and the ability to stride out -- was something unimaginable back when we'd been dealing with the quagmire gymnastics of Maine.

Bashful and I had been leapfrogging each other, in another example of tortoise-vs-hare hiking styles. My naturally faster pace was offset by my wish to chat with all the nobos we were meeting and to hear some of their stories, during which time she'd catch up again.

One thing she's mentioned was that she'd decided to get off the trail in New Jersey, having concluded she'd spent too long away from her partner. Until then, she'd reduced her mileage to 10 miles or so a day so she'd enjoy her final weeks on the trail.

She stopped at the shelter midway through the riverside section but I pushed on, aiming to get into Kent that night. In between was St John's Ledges, which was billed, according to the comments in the guide, as some of the most difficult trail since the Whites.

As stated often before, I'd long since ceased paying attention to nobos' warnings but wondered if maybe this was a message worth heeding. Comments on Guthook, the app I'm using as the trail guide, talked about it being exceptionally sketchy to do in wet weather.

But of course it was fine, featuring a boulder staircase that we'd have dreamed of seeing in the middle of the Mahoosucs. Once on the crest of the ridge, the trail undulated relatively gently for the next few miles before eventually coming down to the road.

After about 20 minutes with my thumb out, I was driven to the supermarket to stock up for the next section of the AT. 

Kent proved to be a wealthy little town, clearly showing the gentrifying effect of its proximity to NYC, and on this pleasant August weekend, it was hosting some kind of classic car show and sidewalk sale. The place was humming.

Then I went to find a restaurant to fulfill my more immediate needs for calories and alcohol, finding the perfect place at the Kent Pizza Garden.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: As I was finding a place for dinner, a bunch of archetypal weekend tourists were chatting about the AT and then looked at me as if I was some kind of exotic species. After the usual questions -- I've been hiking for two months, I hope to be done by Halloween and, spoiler alert, I have to sleep in the woods -- they asked me where I was sleeping tonight. I think my answer (""I have no idea"") might have truly shocked them.","Pine Swamp lean to

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575138,"Today was quite a day for milestones. After a few hours of hiking, I crossed the unmarked line which signifies the one-third point of the trail. 

Then after lunch I crossed out of Connecticut for the final time (the trail had earlier briefly crossed into New York and back again), with this border marking the end of not just our fifth state but of New England as a whole. 

But probably of the greatest significance, given the central role that food now plays in my hiking universe, I did my first bout of ""deli blazing"" -- hiking from deli to deli, the compensating counterbalance for the less-wild and the more densely-populated nature of New York state.

If Toni's Deli is an accurate introduction, I'm in for a fun time in this state. The hot roll filled with enough melted cheese and deli meats to choke a horse was the perfect end to a hiking day.

I'd started that morning in Kent with a town breakfast, which always seems to set me up well for the day. A local filling his car with gas then drove me a mile out of his way to drop me back at the trail.

There was a short steep climb to regain the ridgeline and that's pretty much where the trail stayed for the next five miles before dropping down to Bulls Bridge, a historic covered bridge at a point where the Housatonic squeezed through a set of cataracts exploited for hydro electricity generation.

I blue-blazed down a side trail to see the bridge, which remains in use, and then took advantage of the convenience store nearby to slake some cold soda ready for another afternoon of climbing and descending.

I'd already crossed briefly into New York on the stretch before Bulls Bridge and the bottom of the hill was roughly mile 729.9, which my internal calculator seemed to think was one third of the current AT distance of 2189.5 miles.

The next section of trail took me across the Connecticut-New York boundary for the final time.

I had a powerful incentive to haul a few more miles: Toni's Deli, about which nobos had been waxing lyrical.

And it was work the extra effort, even if my ass was definitely dragging on the ground a little by the time I finally arrived an hour before dark.

The sandwich they created revived my spirits and then the updated forecast on my phone -- calling for rain from soon after dawn, totalling an impressive-for-these-parts half an inch -- was enough to confirm my original plan for tomorrow to be a zero day.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The deli people seem to be used to hikers too -- they understand about enormous portion sizes and of the importance of WiFi and the provision of power outlets. And they let hikers sleep on the side lawn for $2, where they have the opportunity to be, um, serenaded to sleep by highway noise on one side and the blaring horns of passing Metro North trains on the other.","Kent, CT

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575435,"How much easier is the trail in northern New York? I took three hours off the AT today to have lunch with a visiting friend but still managed to get in just shy of 20 miles and also eat town food three times.

The day revolved around meeting Christine, a former New Yorker who I met in Abu Dhabi after she moved there with her husband, John. 

Having caught up former sandpit dwellers Jen, Yas, Matt and Tommy in Boston and then Kathryn in Vermont, Christine quipped that catching me on the trail was the 2017 version of the 2016 Pokemon craze.

She'd been visiting friends in Manhattan but was heading up to their country home near Egremont, just over the border from Great Barrington in Massachusetts, so I arranged to meet her at midday near Nuclear Lake.

The complicating factor in this is I didn't know what the trail will be like in New York. So far, different volunteer groups had been responsible for specific sections of the trail, and the differing philosophies at play produced markedly different kinds of trail, with correspondingly diverse average hiking speeds.

My inherent pessimism about potential speeds and a near-pathological hatred of keeping others waiting by being late meant I allocated four hours to do a smidge over eight miles.

First of all, though, was a diner breakfast. At 7am, I dragged myself out of bed and walked a few hundred yards down the road from my motel to the nearest deli.

This was only just a few miles up the road from Toni's Deli but the difference caused by the trailer park across the road was obvious. Especially from my years reporting from the criminal courts, I always could tell from their faces which people have had hard lives -- whether through hard drugs, alcohol, smoking or just the vicissitudes of life. All of those present in the diner, whether they were staff or customers, had that look.

But the welcome was genuine enough, the coffee did the business and the breakfast was the kind of stodge that I knew would power me over the next few miles.

Hitchhiking is illegal in New York, I'd been told, but I managed to get a lift down the road easily enough with someone who had previously taken lots of AT hikers and knew where the trail crossing was.

Because I'd allowed for a conservative 2mph pace, the trail was -- of course -- like a racetrack.

Nuclear Lake was named for the nuclear research facility that was briefly housed in this former private hunting estate, and less happily for the accident in the 1950s that led to the leaking of radioactive material. None of this history was in any way obvious nor explained to the passing AT hiker, although with that knowledge I was happy I didn't need to fill water from any of these seemingly unpolluted streams.

The fast trail and my excessive inherent pessimism meant I arrived at the meeting place on Highway 55 a full hour early.

That was fine, since the weather was sunny and warm and I thought it would provide the chance to catch on this journal. But instead I ended up chatting with another guy also waiting in the parking area. 

Tar Heel -- from, of course, North Carolina -- had thru-hiked the AT back in the Mesozoic era of 1979 but now was hoping to catch up with his two stepdaughters, who were hiking it this year. These turned out to be two of the three Goldilocks, from the tramily Three Goldilocks and the Bear. He proved to be an interesting guy, and we compared notes on places like Nepal, for which we'd both organised fundraisers in response to the 2015 earthquakes.

After an entertaining half hour, he realised the tramily had already passed this way so he departed in hope of catching them at another road crossing.

Soon after that, Christine arrived and we headed across to Karen's Diner in Pawling, where we spent a truly enjoyable hour or so catching up on the events in the nine months or so since I left the middle East. 

Fortified with both food and details of friends from my old life, she then dropped me back at the Nuclear Lake parking area and, three hours after my arrival, we headed off in our respective directions.

Normally a three-hour absence from the trail would have resulted in a daily distance tally in the low teens. But the trail remained equally fast this afternoon for the next eight miles. 

This took me to Highway 52, where a quarter mile side trail led to Mountain Top deli. This had been my original intended goal for the night, since the deli allowed hikers to pitch their tents in the back garden for free.

But I worked out it was early enough that I could head to the deli, stock up on dinner and still make the next shelter before dark. Strictly speaking, RPH shelter didn't require that kind of pre-planning, since it's famous for being one of only a few AT shelters where one can order pizza delivery, but I had my heart set on another deli meal.

Late afternoon is one of my favorite times to hike and I used to call it golden hour on the CDT. The incentive to get to the hut before dark was definitely helpful and thanks to yet more nice trail -- amid a couple of solid climbs -- I rocked up to RPH at 8.15pm. There was maybe 15 minutes of walkable light left.

I found Three Goldilocks and the Bear already here. They were all laid out in food comas, with the stack of empty pizza boxes telling the rest of the story.

It was surprisingly unbuggy so I was able to crash out on a sun lounger just outside the shelter, where I fell asleep after a truly mesmerising display of fireflies in the garden.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: One of those I'd been hiking around has had to get off the trail for a week to attend to some unrelated bureaucratic demands. He's a recently retired 30-year Navy veteran, which is known to lead to a certain, um, firmness of thought patterns. So his practical joking former hiking partner has arranged to send him some packing tape via some nobos. ""After his years in the military,"" the former hiking buddy told me, ""he's going to see this, not understand why I sent him the tape and it's going to drive him crazy!""

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575436,"Observing the passing parade of nobos is a bit like watching the seasons change. The dead-eyed speedsters who predominated early on were eventually replaced by the diligent hikers who retained a proper sense of enjoyment and now we're getting into the party bubble. 

They're the slower-moving ones who are on course to take six or seven months to complete their hikes, having struggled to escape the various vortexes of comfort that the trail provides between the actual hiking.

When I took the quarter mile side trail to Canopus Beach in Fahnestock State Park and saw a dozen nobo hikers milling around, it was clear that most of them were in the party bubble.

This point was particularly emphasised when it became obvious that most of these people had arrived the day before then hung around until 10am, when the park's concession stand opened again.

As I was heading away again at 11.30am or so after a quick refueling stop for a hamburger, few of the overnighters showed any inclination to leave and one even cautioned, in all seriousness, against leaving in the hottest part of the day. 

It was clear this was a group that was immune to Katahdin fever, a common malady in which hikers are driven by the destination rather than the journey.

The day was indeed hot but the trail was entirely within the tree line so the heat was certainly manageable. 

The trail was also mostly kind and we were yet to see evidence of what nobos had warned us about New York, which involved variations on: ""It's really badly marked but if you can't see a white blaze, look for the nearest pile of rocks because the trail will go straight over it."" 

As with nearly all such prognostications, we ignored it and said nothing, but were thinking: ""Just wait till you get to Maine!"" They'll find out soon enough.

I took a break at the final road crossing, where I had three more miles before my intended destination for the night, which was a baseball field in a sprawling church complex used as a rehab centre. For reasons unknown to me, there's a 30+ mile gap between AT shelters so the church lets hiking addicts camp on the field for free.

I'm not sure if it was my demeanour or the pastoral concerns of the locals but two cars stopped while I rested at the roadside before the final push and asked if I was ok.

I was, and despite some hilly sections the final three miles took an unexpectedly short one hour and 15 minutes, to the extent that I questioned my map reading skills when I arrived at a road crossing just on the outskirts of the church complex because it seemed too soon.

Usually at the end of the day, its easy to overestimate how far you've travelled, with a spirit-crushing effect when the reality becomes clear. I'll take this over that!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We're used to seeing groups of a dozen or so kids hiking bits of the trail as part of their annual summer camps. Today a truly enormous group of around 50 headed past as I was leaving Fahnestock State Park. This immediately brought to mind the huge school groups I'd encountered on the Israel Trail earlier in the year, which led me to joke that the Israeli Ministry of Education guidelines state that the minimum safe number for hiking is enough people to be able to recreate the crowd scene in Ben Hur. Sure enough several of the hikers in the group today had Hebrew writing on their shirts, identifying them as ""shvilistim"" (the Hebrew word for hikers). Maybe it's a cultural thing?","RPH shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575432,"The last piece of the AT to be completed was back in Maine, crossing under Sugarloaf mountain in what we were discovering was classic AT style: by first dropping then regaining 2000ft instead of following an easy undulating ridgeline that would have avoided this unnecessary exertion. 

Today we hiked the very first section of the AT to be completed, which was the complete opposite experience. It was, in a rare moment of trail accuracy from nobos, ""like a Japanese garden"".

But there was so much more to Bear Mountain State Park than that, including a museum and trailside zoo that was originally supposed to be the model for all 14 states on the AT so that city dwellers could not only experience some wildness in their increasingly industrialised society but also learn more about the natural world they were passing through.

So far as I know, no other state built their own trailside zoo so today this one stands alone. It was certainly popular with children and family groups, although any smelly AT hiker who followed the white blazes as it goes through the zoo is more likely to feel like one of the exhibits than a visitor.

This was also the lowest point of the trail, in more ways than one. Physically, the zoo trail was just 160ft above sea level but environmentally and morally, this was very much an ""old school"" zoo where animals were kept in tiny enclosures. The saddest of all of these was the black bear, which sat surrounded by birds of prey (vultures? buzzards?) as if they were awaiting his imminent demise.

The low elevation was probably responsible for this being one of the hottest sections of trail yet, particularly when the trail left the shade of the forest and crossed the Hudson River via Bear Mountain Bridge.

The midday heat left me feeling lethargic despite the awesome deli breakfast just a mile from our ball park campground. I tried topping up at a hot dog concession but the only thing that really helped was retreating into the aircon at the Bear Mountain Inn, a depression era work project similar to Timberline Lodge on Mt Hood or even Bascom Lodge on Mt Greylock.

After being there for half an hour, Spiff and Littlefoot walked in, looking similarly enervated. They admitted feeling in a DGAF mood and opted for some of the craft beers being sold in the restaurant.

I understood entirely what they were feeling. ""Some days,"" I said, ""are just high-gravity days.""

I stayed for an hour longer with them, partly because their cellphone charger had been stolen the day before and so they used mine to charge their phone. But I was also feeling equally torpid, although I knew that the beer on a hot day was only going to make matters worse.

I headed on, more out of a sense of obligation rather than enthusiasm, in mid afternoon for the ascent of Bear Mountain via the trail the nobos had described as the Japanese garden.

This was the biggest climb we'd done in some time but it was also beautifully graded, thanks in part to the gazillion interpretive signs that explained the AT and the best-practice construction techniques that were on display here (but which, ironically, were only occasionally seen elsewhere on the actual trail).

By the time I reached the tower at the top, I was very grateful to have avoided the lunchtime beers. The far side was equally well graded and I made good time down to the road in the far side, at which point the usual trail quality resumed.

There was a shelter on the ridge of the next mountain but it was half a mile off trail and, unusually, didn't have any source of water in the immediate vicinity. It was reported to have an excellent view of the Manhattan skyline but the haze that stymied the view from the tower meant it was unlikely to be at its best.

So I pushed on, aiming to camp at the next shelter after that. But at 8pm and with a mile to go before the shelter, a makeshift campsite presented itself on the far side of Black Mountain and I decided it was good enough.

This is my lowest tally of miles from a full day of hiking in a while but for a high-gravity day, it's not too bad.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: This was not only the biggest climb we'd done in some time but also one of the longest dry stretches. From what the nobos say, we'll be relying increasingly on roadside water caches left by trail angels -- or will this prove to be just another example of baseless nobo hype?","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center baseball field

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575433,"One of the bits of advice that Shaman, a nobo we met way back in Monson at the southern end of the 100 mile wilderness, gave was not to look at the map of where the AT went because it would only dispirit us. 

While we've long since learned to ignore anything nobos say unless it revolves around food, this advice was accurate.

Shaman's example was a section in the south which does a huge six-mile loop that could be avoided by a quarter mile shortcut. The only reason he hadn't followed his own advice was that he'd been on a ridge above the loop and could see it and the shortcut.

On any other long trail, the idea of going without a map would be absurd. But one of the many ways in which the AT is different is it's so well marked with white blazes that many hikers make do with just an elevation guide, advising whether the trail climbs or descends, how steeply and for how long, so the ignorance-is-bliss principle is a feasible option.

Today this was demonstrated via a series of PUDs -- pointless ups and downs, an AT speciality. Had I not had a map I might have convinced myself that the several brutal ascents and descents might have been unavoidable from, say, crossing a ridgeline.

But I prefer to have a real map and that showed the unpalatable truth: in almost each case, the climb over an isolated knoll was wholly unnecessary.

""This is all good training for Maine,"" I told the nobos who came past. But obviously sobos don't need to train for Maine, having already experienced the real thing, which added an extra degree of pointlessness to the task.

A section hiker who was pushing dark to do nine miles summed it up rather more succinctly, describing the PUD he'd just done as ""this motherf***er"".

It wasn't all PUDs, though, although there were certainly more than I cared for. Today was also the day we encountered such evocatively-named New York trail landmarks as ""the lemon squeezer"" and ""agony grind"".

The first one was a convoluted difficulty which the trail specifically routed itself to encounter when there was easy terrain to either side. The next was a series of jumbled boulders for about half a mile.

""If these were on the Mahoosucs,"" I muttered to myself, ""they wouldn't have names and the only reason why they'd be memorable is because sobos would be thinking 'Oh, the trail's improved'.""

There was also another hazard on today's route that was truly avoidable but in this case of some seriousness: the bear problem at Fingerboard shelter. We'd been hearing stories about this place since New Hampshire but despite the reputation, there was no bear box provided and the problem persisted. 

As if to emphasise this, I found the remains of a ripped-open drybag that had been hanging from a tree -- apparently in textbook fashion -- but which had been snaffled by a bear just the day before.

All this makes today sound grim but there were certainly bright spots, such as meeting Headley, a local trail angel who runs a food and water cache just before a notorious PUD. He comes by every couple of days to restock the supplies and on this occasion came with apples, bananas and even mangos.

He was good value to talk to and it was nice to have the chance to thank him in person.

After this day of convoluted difficulties and unnecessary PUDs, I was glad that the final few miles were all downhill to Fitzgerald Falls. I arrived to find Train, a hiker I'd been leapfrogging since Maine, already in situ.

This was a popular place, being close to the road and featuring a 50ft waterfall, which meant it took a little while to find a tent site without broken glass from where idiots had smashed bottles.

But I finally found a suitable place and managed to put up my tent just as the light patter of raindrops turned into proper rain. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: I feel like a failure: today was a day without a deli, in a state so filled with them that they call it ""deli-blazing"" rather than ""white blazing"". But thanks to Headley's generosity, I did manage to eat food I hadn't carried. And today's campsite is designed to put me in striking range of a roadside hot dog vendor tomorrow. Win!","Mt Black

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575603,"On my previous thru-hikes, there has always been a crucible moment when the landmarks stop being physical, such as lakes or passes or mountains, and start revolving around food instead.

I suspect the deli blazing of New York* has prompted this moment on the AT because I'd specifically arranged my hike today to be bookended by two sessions of eating town food.

(* Notwithstanding yesterday's #TrailFail in which I didn't visit a single deli.)

But of course, hiking the AT -- and life in general -- doesn't always fit neatly into these scripts we write for ourselves.

I'd chosen my campsite not just so I'd be set up to get to the first deli-blaze option when it opened but also so that there'd be no sign of my temporary occupation. But because of the rain that lasted for most of the night, I couldn't help leaving a conspicuous diamond-shaped dry patch on the leaf litter showing where my tent had been. As LNT failures go, it was one I could live with.

The terrain remained pleasant for the first couple of miles to the next shelter, where there was a veritable nobo bubble in situ, thanks in part to the previous evening's downpour causing them to seek shelter.

How many more of these nobo bubbles are we likely to see? Most of the nobos have already gone past and many of those stragglers at the back of the pack -- whether due to injury, indolence or excessive partying -- seem likely to flip to Katahdin from Harper's Ferry, the trail's halfway mark.

Those present were a friendly bunch, although the fact that they were at the back of the pack seemed less surprising since they were just getting moving when I'd already hiked a few miles after an already leisurely start to my day so I'd arrive at the first trail food option when it opened at 10.30am.

They including a family unit of a brother and sister thru-hiking with their father. The brother, Fiddle, had extended this literal tramily by adopting a kitten in Waynesboro, VA, and carrying him on top of his pack through West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and now New York. This peripatetic feline even had his own trail name: Odie the trail cat.

They also warned of difficult trail ahead for me, which is a perpetual refrain from nobos that we'd mostly learned to ignore after so many previous well-meaning attempts at advice had proved to be baseless hype.

I headed on and the trail was a real superhighway, but with two short sections where it took to the bedrock ribs that had remained unvegetated 20,000 years after the ice cap finally retreated from these parts. 

Just to emphasise the superhighway status, both of these were avoidable via blue-blazed trails to one side.

As I approached the actual highway, I took a further blue-blazed trail heading to where the Guthook app said the two food options were sited.

One was a creamery, offering ice cream sourced from the dairy farms in the valley below, but it didn't open until midday, which ruled that out. However the hot dog guy was supposed to open in mid-morning, which ought to allow me to still make it to a farm shop near Vernon, New Jersey, that was famous on the trail for its food.

You know that epithet about assumption being the mother of all f-ups? I assumed from the Guthook icon and the descriptions that the parking lot opposite the creamery was where the hot dog guy rocked up in a mobile van.

At 10.30am, the parking lot was still empty. Ten minutes later, I figured he must have cancelled for the day and so I walked despondently back to the trail via the highway... and in the process found the permanent hot dog van on the southern side of the road.

Two chili cheese dogs later, my energy levels -- and my world view -- were much improved.

This was fortunate, because the next six miles to the New York-New Jersey border fulfilled the nobos' trail warnings by following the crests of a series of bedrock ribs. And there was no blue-blazed route to avoid these, which were rendered even more tricky by the previous evening's rain.

This made for slow and frustrating progress, until soon after I crossed the New York-New Jersey border and the trail abandoned the ridge and headed into a series of gently rolling hills. 

My average speed must have doubled by this point, but thanks to the dumbassery involved in finding the hot dog guy and then the slowness of the rock ribs that formed New York's farewell to the sobos, the afternoon was drawing on as I scaled the final ridge between me and Heaven Hill, with its gourmet farm produce shop.

The final part of the journey involved a rare moment of steep terrain, which was dubbed -- and roundly criticised --by the nobos as the ""stairway to hell"", coming soon after the delights of Heaven Hill.

However amid the going from the nobos came some good news: the farm stand was as good as the climb was bad and -- crucially -- closed at 7pm.

By then it was 6pm and I cantered down the steep rock staircases, emerging at the road half an hour later. A few more minutes and I was standing outside Heaven Hill -- looking at a locked gate and a conspicuously empty parking lot.

A guy walked past from the nearby farmhouse and explained they'd closed at 6pm. Dang! 

Then he asked how far I'd walked to get here. ""About 18 miles,"" I replied, thinking he might be tempted to show some kindness to a hungry thru-hiker.

""Oh,"" he replied. ""Cool."" And then he continued walking. Dang again.

At that point, my attention shifted to the next bit of trail food, at Pochuck farm restaurant, which was about three miles away. It was closed now but would open at 6am, so I needed to find somewhere to camp in between.

This seemed uncertain, since the terrain in between was a mix of marshland and pastures. There were a couple of streams marked on Guthook but in each case it was so clearly agricultural that I didn't even try filtering from them.

Just as it was getting dark, the trail headed through a patch of forest on an elevated shelf above the marshland. After a few false leads, I found a tent site that had clearly been used by previous thru-hikers. A few minutes later, my tent was up and I'd retreated within.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: I dropped in to Wawayanda shelter in mid afternoon. One of the log book entries said ""Wawayanda"" is an ancient Indian word that translates as ""under the flight path of La Guardia"". It didn't seem like this was a good place for light sleepers...","Fitzgerald Falls

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575608,"Should the calzones at Annabel's restaurant in Unionville be banned from the Olympics? 

Based on the way I powered up to New Jersey's highest point -- the creatively named High Point State Park -- there is a case to be made that these Italian delicacies are definitely performance-enhancing.

I'd arranged to stay tonight with a local hostel run by a former thru-hiker named Mosey, but after being trapped in the food vortex of Annabel's until 2pm, I warned Mosey that I might not make it to the meeting place until 7-8pm.

But with the aid of the calzone, I walked up to the park HQ just before 6pm.

The trail might have something to do with it, of course. Notwithstanding the ascent of the state's highest peak -- a modest 1800ft or so -- the trail was generally beautifully graded and fast.

So too might the huge breakfast and coffee I'd earlier enjoyed at Pochuck Valley farm market, which fueled me over a series of hills and then through the Wallkill River national wildlife refuge to Unionville.

I'd been short of water the night before, thanks to just missing the opening hours of the Heaven Hill farm stand and then finding the water in the swamp-like rivers after that unappealing. It meant I hadn't cooked dinner at my campsite just before the start of the boardwalk.

I already knew from going stoveless on the Israel National Trail that not having a big evening meal usually manifested itself in flagging energy levels the following afternoon. Given that today was going to be long and end with a decent climb, this lesson was a little unnerving.

But the Israel trail didn't offer the deli blazing that the AT does on this part of the world, and that made all the difference.

I was on the road this morning at the early -- for me -- hour of 6.50am because I knew the Pochuck Valley farm market restaurant was open fewer than two miles away.

The early start was already rewarded by the last bit of fog lifting off the marshes through which the magnificent boardwalk meandered.

It turned out I wasn't the only one caught out looking for a campsite last night. On the bridge over Pochuck Creek -- not near the bridge but actually on it -- someone had pitched their tent. I said hello as I went past but the bottle of wine in a paper bag outside the tent suggested the occupant had had an entertaining evening.

This was a Sunday morning and the first early recreational walkers were just arriving so I was guessing his or her sleep in was going to come to an early end.

The restaurant, reached via a mile-long road walk, was everything it was billed to be. That's really saying something, given the raptuous praise previous hikers had given it.

Even at 7.30am, there were some others present. It seemed like this was the local old guys' regular get together on Sundays.

My focus was on coffee and a breakfast sandwich, which arrived with egg, ham and dripping with melted cheese. I think the server looked shocked when I wolfed it down then immediately ordered another.

One of my favorite activities is to settle in over coffee and read a newspaper cover to cover. The cafe had the usual New York papers but also had the local one, The New Jersey Herald, so I went with that -- and discovered it was a discordant right-wing rag with no balancing liberal or progressive voices.

But it was still a pleasant way to start the day and I left at 9am, feeling ready to tackle the hills on the way to New Jersey high point.

Soon after returning to the trail I met some LASHers -- the accepted acronym for people doing ""long-ass section hikes"" along the AT. Zed and Sue were hiking from Massachusetts to Harper's ferry in West Virginia and were clearly even less morning people than me, since they were packing up around 9.30am.

But what they lacked in timely departure they made up for in sheer pace, easily blitzing me up and down the hills.

I knew Unionville was about 10 miles away and that the second half of the journey was on almost flat terrain. Even the hilly bits were generally well graded and then as the trail went into the national wildlife refuge, it was as flat as a pancake. I could get used to this!

The final traverse into Unionville followed a former train line, which just goes to show how easy the grade was.

Coming into the turnoff into town, the AT left the railroad route and headed uphill for reasons unknown. I stayed on the train track and discovered the reason for the detour when the line followed a girder bridge about five metres above a waterfall -- and getting to the other side meant inching across a narrow girder with no handrail.

Having survived that, I was soon walking into the pleasant little village of Unionville, which was just over the New York state line. The idea of a final deli blaze even after I'd nominally left New York was an amusing final flirtation with this state. As I was walking in, a nobo walking back to the trail confirmed that Annabel's restaurant was ""legit"".

Zed and Sue were already in situ so I sat beside them and ordered the Stromboli calzone. At $6.95 for one, I was thinking it couldn't be that big so, taking my cue from the Pochuck restaurant, I ordered two.

""Are you sure,"" the waitress asked. I was.

When the first calzone arrived, it was truly enormous -- even by the standards of American portion sizes.

""I think I've made a mistake,"" I thought, later getting the second calzone to take away and putting it into my pack, ""but it's a mistake I suspect future me will be very happy with.""

And I am.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575609,"A few hours into my truncated hike today, I walked up to Mashipacong shelter and saw an unfamiliar face but someone who was clearly a thru-hiker. 

""Are you a nobo?"" I asked.

""Sobo,"" he replied. ""I'm Grandpa.""

This was a name I'd been following in the trail registers since near the start of the trail. He was also no ordinary thru-hiker, because this was his fourth thru-hike of the AT. And his second sobo hike.

I soon discovered that wasn't even the end of it. His goal was to hike the AT six -- SIX! -- more times.

I remember thinking that I couldn't imagine hiking this trail even twice, let alone multiple times. This was both for reasons associated with this trail in particular but also the general principal that because there are so many other awesome trails around the world -- including the PCT and CDT -- redoing the AT would be like going into a restaurant and ordering the same meal again and again and again and again when there are other awesome options on the menu.

He then pushed on, heading to the next shelter for the night, while I hung around reading the register at this one. As befits someone with close to 8,000 AT miles under his shoes, he rocketed away at a great pace and I didn't see him again that day.

This meeting was purely serendipitous. If I hadn't taken the morning off the trail, I'd have been ahead of him because he'd returned to the trail after taking a few days off and, through his habit of walking fast but taking long breaks off the trail, it's unlikely our paths would have crossed again.

My leisurely morning was its own reward even before that. Just having the opportunity to do my laundry was worth it, after last doing it back in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, which I was a little embarrassed to realize had been FOUR states ago. It had also been a sweaty while since my last shower.

But as Mosey's sole guest for the day, there was no rush to get back to the trail so instead we could have an interesting morning chatting about our respective homes and lives. The heroin epidemic I'd been hearing so much about was no abstract problem for her, with several members of her extended family having become entangled in that particular web.

When we headed to the trail, it was via a Walmart in Pennsylvania to resupply. After being dropped off back at the park HQ, I went into the park office, which had been closed the day before, and was rewarded with the cold Pepsi they give to every passing thru-hiker. Win! 

I delayed my already tardy departure yet further by eating a final heavyweight meal at a picnic table before dumping my trash and reluctantly donning my pack at 1.30pm.

From here, the trail followed the crest of a long and gently undulating ridgeline that would take me eventually into Pennsylvania in two more days. My goal was more modest: depending on whether the rocks in southern New Jersey were as bad as the nobos had claimed (spoiler alert: they weren't), I'd hoped to reach either Gren Anderson shelter, where Grandpa had gone, or to the fire lookout tower a mile or so beyond.

Thanks to the nobos' latest overblown warning, I reached the fire tower with an hour of light to spare. The picnic table facing the sunset was an added bonus.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Along the way today I met Treehouse, who proudly boosted that he'd taken 97 zero days so far as part of a hike that had already spanned about six months. Then I worked out that after starting in February, he'd stopped and worked at an AT hostel near Damascus for two months.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576082,"Cowboy camping is the norm on trails like the PCT, and probably two thirds of my thru-hike was spent sleeping under a sky of swirling stars instead of pitching my tent. 

Like just about everything else on the AT, those trail rules don't apply here and so far every single night on the trail has been on some form of shelter, be it my tent, a lean to or some form of hotel or hostel.

But with the spirit of optimism that worked so well for the US in Iraq, I decided that it might the first time to bring cowboy camping to the AT.

The forecast was good, the landing on the fire lookout tower was off the ground and thus out of range of ticks, spiders and similar annoyances... What could go wrong?

Until sunset, the mosquitoes had barely made their presence felt but as soon as the sun set, they came out in force, compelling me to don my headnet and pull the sleeping bag up to my neck. This came at a cost because it was a warm night and even in my summerweight bag, I was sweating.

""Maybe I should just pitch my tent,"" a wise voice inside my head suggested. ""Nah!"" replied the more common voice of laziness and misplaced optimism, thinking that the evening would cool off soon enough.

After an hour of repeating the cycle of sweating in my sleeping bag and then occasionally opening it to let in cool air -- and, unfortunately, mosquitoes -- I managed to get to sleep.

And then, around 10pm, the first raindrops began.

""Are you freaking kidding me?"" I thought, with both wise and lazy voices now in a rare moment of unity.

At first I ignored it (see: voices, lazy and/or unwarrantedly optimistic) but when the rain persisted, the wise voice prevailed and I went down the tower and pitched my tent.

All this drama might explain why I was going a little slowly this morning.

Fortunately I had a compelling goal ahead: the Mohican Outdoor Center, which offered beds, showers and -- most importantly -- a deli. The only impediment was it was a shade under 20 miles away and I knew the deli closed at 6.30pm.

Everything revolved around one crucial question: Would the trail be kind or cruel today? 

Even with the previous evening's cowboy camping shenanigans, the prospect of a cooked meal had me heading away early. 

Wild, the other thru-hiker present, demonstrated the single most identifying trait found among everyone at the back of the nobo bubble: an inability to get going early. But she'd also had the brains to pitch her tent last night instead of cowboy camping, so I wasn't really in a position to pass judgement.

I was hiking without poles, as is my preference in terrain not involving steep descents, which might have been crucial to unwittingly sneaking up on a young bear.

It bolted from about 20 meters away, crossing the trail and then disappearing into the western side of the ridge at a pace that was astonishingly quick.

Usain Bolt couldn't have outrun this bear, which I promptly dubbed Ursain Bolt(ed). I was happy to have ticked this box for charismatic megafauna, but unlike my tally of seven moose, I was more than happy not to see more than one.

Soon after this encounter, the ridge gently descended to Culver's Gap then climbed back up more steeply on the far side to regain the ridgeline and continue the long traverse that had begun at the New Jersey high point two days before.

I'm happy to report that the rest of the way was firmly in the kind end of the trail spectrum, rather than the cruel one, and for long stretches the trail was on old and gently-graded forestry roads. There were sections of entirely unnecessary difficulty -- of course, since this is the AT after all -- but most of these could be bypassed.

Soon the Rattlesnake Swamp side trail appeared and I took it to Mohican Outdoor Center, arriving at the entirely respectable hour of 3.30pm.

An hour later, I'd eaten my first copperhead sandwich (a concoction of cheese, bacon and chicken breast), was waiting to order a second shortly before the kitchen shut. I also have my hot shower and bunk room -- where I'm the sole tenant -- sorted.

Do I need to say it? Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Along the trail today I ran into Mooseburger, an 84-year-old who'd thru-hiked the AT in 1999 and has since been rehiking it for a month every year, with the exception of one summer when he had a hip replacement. He's done a second cumulative full hike of the AT and is well on the way to his third. Like with Grandpa the day before, I couldn't help asking why not try a different trail? He said the PCT's easy gradients meant there was no challenge to it. And there's a challenge to doing a trail you've already done twice?","Culver fire tower

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576083,"The two warnings from nobos that we were given again and again and again were about the mud of Vermont (or, as they dubbed it, ""Vermud"") and the rocks of Pennsylvania (""Rocksylvania"".)

As we crossed the Delaware River and changed from New Jersey into Pennsylvania, we didn't know whether to expect the rock warnings to be more overblown hype, like the mud had been. Or is there some veracity to the rock stories that, as a nobo called Treehouse had told me two days before, had been so dispiriting that they caused several of his friends to quit the trail?

As we were pondering this on the ascent out of Delaware Water Gap, a section hiker approached, having come out of the area we were about to enter.

Our attention was inescapably drawn to his boots, which were truly knackered and being held together with liberal quantities of duct tape.

""They looked new before Pennsylvania,"" he explained.

But, like everything on the AT, it was just a matter heading on and finding out. The most measured nobo response I'd heard about the rocks were that they were tedious rather than difficult and that they were also intermittent, with long stretches of easy trail between them.

Still, after seeing those boots...

My departure from Mohican Outdoor Center was a leisurely one, timed around breakfast being served at 8am. The breakfast was worth waiting for, and it fuelled me through the first part of the day.

I'd expected the 12 mile walk to Delaware Water Gap to be a mundane one but soon after rejoining the AT, I happened upon Grandpa and Train. We ended up walking most of the way to town together, which gave me a chance to get to know each of them a little better.

One of the things I found puzzling about early retirees, as Grandpa was, is how much they focus on making their money last and how little they think about paying forward all the levels of privilege that had allowed them to retire early in the first place.

But Grandpa's apparent obsession with the AT had a point. He knew the trail -- and more specifically, the people along it who help out hikers -- well enough that he could do a seven-month thru-hike for $1000. Any other trail would be far more expensive.

And his daughter, a financial planner by trade, said that if he lives this minimalist lifestyle for six more years, he'll have enough money to open an AT hostel which will be donation based and just break even, while helping hikers with shallower pockets.

Train was similarly interesting. He works writing network software to cover HVAC systems but through working for government, he has the highest level security clearance. Through this he has access to places like the White House.

And yet he lives in Maryland, 15 minutes from where he was born, and has never travelled outside the US. Ever.

His AT dream started when he was a 12-year-old boy scout and encountered a thru-hiker who stopped who explained what he was doing.

""I thought it was the coolest thing ever,"" he explained, and he vowed to do it one day. His 50th birthday, along with a few other events, was the prompt to turn ""one day"" into June 1, 2017, on Katahdin.

These conversations helped some fairly mundane miles go by. There were a few features of note, but such features were out trumped by the prospect of more town food, across the border in Delaware Water Gap. After a slightly unnerving crossing of the river on the Interstate 80, which bounced every time a big truck went past, we walked into the pleasant enclaves of town.

The Church of the Mountain hosted hikers for free, so Grandpa headed there while Train and I headed to a bakery and then to a gas station convenience store to do enough of a resupply to get us to Palmerton.

Once the afternoon heat had eased a little, we climbed up the riverside bluff to regain the continuation of the long ridge we'd been following north of the river. It's the same geology, so why should the rocks be any different here?

And then we saw the guy with the duct-taped boots...

One of the bits of beta he gave us was that the difficult rocks didn't start for a few miles further and we had easy travel to Kirkridge shelter.

I guess we'll find out about the rocks tomorrow...

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: One of the geomorphic landmarks today was passing the last glacier-carved pond on the trail, showing we were finally out of the area covered by the Larentide ice sheet until 20,000 years ago. Will that mean no more ribs of bedrock? And is this the reason why ""Rocksylvania"" is different?","Mohican Outdoor Center
",Kirkridge lean to,"Aug 16, Wed",17.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576084,"""I do not like the rocks of Pennsylvania."" 

That comment from Train, coming apropos of nothing as we sat taking a break in the midst of the ongoing rock garden that had been the trail for at least the past five miles, was a tacit admission that maybe all the nobos' warnings about ""Rocksylvania"" actually involved a germ of truth.

If it was any consolation, at least the trail designers didn't seem to be looking for the rockier terrain to add more challenge, as they had done as recently as a few days ago. It was clear that everywhere was rocky.

And the terrain wasn't quite as bad as the nobos' hype about there being nowhere you can place your foot flatly. I was doing so for probably 80 per cent of the time.

Even with having to concentrate on our feet all the time, we still managed an entirely creditable 2.5mph. It was, as one trustworthy nobo had said, tedious rather than particularly difficult.

And after more miles of this than I'd have preferred, the trail returned to normal tread and we were able to walk normally again. 

Throughout the day, there were more rocky sections but not for any sustained distance and we were able to complete a respectable tally of just under 20 miles. With rain forecast for tonight and then again tomorrow afternoon, this sets us up well to get into Palmerton by lunchtime.

Our progress was also helped by another dose of town food in the middle of the day. To be honest, I hadn't seriously considered making the mile-long trek to the cafe in Windy Gap but when we crossed the road after nine miles of walking, Train said he was surprised I hadn't suggested it. With the midday heat making itself felt, the idea made more sense and we rocked into town for burgers, fries and many refills of cold, sweet sodas at a very hiker-welcoming cafe. 

The terrain -- PCT grades, but sadly without PCT tread quality -- also gave me chance to get to know Train a little better. Like just about everyone out here, he's an interesting guy. I guess it comes automatically when people actively choose to follow a different path -- figuratively but also literally -- to the one society pushes us towards.

Among the trail discussions that helped the miles fly by were topics such as the large percentage of the new generation of tech grads who seem unwilling to get their hands dirty, about the need to care about doing your job better today than yesterday rather than giving in to complacency and mediocrity, and various tales of youthful indiscretions before we were old enough to know better.

All this helped us arrive at our campsite a couple of hours before dark. There was a spring but it was about 0.4 miles down a steep slope. 

Since we're definitely in bear country, I suggested one of us go down while the other watched the packs. I still had plenty of energy so I offered to go, and Train was more than happy to accept! When I returned half an hour later, I concurred with his view...

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The bear issue is certainly real, which made it rather more worrying when, while checking out the various campsites, we found some previous occupant had dumped probably a pound of dog food -- presumably surplus to his or her needs -- in the middle of camp. That's not going to help...","Kirkridge lean to

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576085,"When the rain began -- first with a few fat drops and then with a downpour that verged on the biblical -- all we could do is watch. 

It helped, of course, that we were watching this tempest through a window while sitting inside an air conditioned room at a hiker hostel rather than being out in it.

""This was a good day to take a nero, eh Train?"" I quipped. He'd thought about continuing on to the trail south of Palmerton but was very happy to have given in to my indolent tendencies rather than his more innate workaholic ones.

I'd worried that this well-forecast afternoon storm might have occurred while we were descending Lehigh Gap, a notoriously difficult jumble of boulders where the ridge we've been following since the New Jersey high point is breached by the Lehigh River.

It's why I was keen to get going early this morning, since the speed of the trail remained an unknown, even though we only had less than 10 miles to do.

As it happened, the long rock gardens similar to the start of yesterday's section were absent, other than for a brief moments. 

But since it had rained all night, the rocks we did encounter early on were slippery and required extra care. 

This area is famous for the boulder descent but also for the remediation efforts to revegetate the ridge after the effects of a century of zinc smelting in Palmerton had left it looking as barren as the moon. 

The smelter had closed down more than 25 years ago but the vegetation was definitely still in recovery mode compared to the long green tunnel the rest of the ridge had been. 

""I'm sure there would be great views here,"" Train said, ""if we weren't in this cloud.""

One of my theories so far about Rocksylvania is that for nobos, every difficult section is followed by an easy one, like a kind of half-apology.

What it meant for us sobos is that every time I found a section of easy trail, I'd begin to think they must be something awful ahead. Quite often, this was proved right.

So when the trail avoided the rocky crest of the ridge and instead took a fast and smooth old forestry road to one side, I knew we were getting close to Lehigh Gap.

We were fortunate to not just avoid doing this segment in driving rain but also for the jumbled boulders to have mostly dried out from the previous evening's heavy rainfall. With one short section of scrambling, where use of hands were as essential as they had been in Maine, we reached the highway just before midday.

In truth, it was not nearly as bad as I'd expected -- the guidebook talked about it being ""reminiscent of the Whites"", which is a chilling comparison to those who'd already done those mountains -- but by the same standard, we knew that in different conditions it could have been much much worse.

Soon we were sitting in Bert's Restaurant in Palmerton, eating a huge pile of appropriate stodge, and an hour later, we'd snaffled bunks in the old manager's office at the back, showered and had done our laundry when the afternoon deluge began.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Until a few years ago, AT hikers would stay for free in the town's old jail. But then a few badly behaved hikers ruined it for all who followed and that option was closed. We're fortunate that other locals, such as the manager of Bert's, took it on themselves to fill the gap.","Delps Spring campsite
","Palmerton, PA","Aug 18, Fri",9.70
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576751,"The restaurant owner took one look at me as I walked in and immediately said: ""Dirty hikers!"" 

I looked back at him and said: ""Well, it's a dirty restaurant, so we'll fit right in.""

His laughter showed I'd chosen the right response.

The Blue Mountain Summit B&B has a bit of a mixed reputation on the trail, based on reviews from previous hikers cited by Guthook. One talked about how the owner insulted the group of seven hikers for their entire meal, despite being the only customers.

But I suspected before I arrived that he was someone who enjoys getting a rise from complete strangers. The correct strategy was to respond in kind.

By the time we left, he'd been sitting at our table cracking jokes and then laughing uproariously as we showed him the reviews of his place -- and, more particularly, him -- on Guthook.

Better still, the burgers and fries powered me for the rest of the afternoon and helped me do my longest day in some time.

That top-up meal was after a town breakfast at Bert's had already powered me through the first half of the day. Stodge really does make a difference when it comes to hiking, at least for my metabolism.

The three Goldilocks and the Bear had rocked up into town the previous afternoon and, when the downpour began, quickly reached the same conclusion about taking a nero.

All six of us headed back to the trail after breakfast, driven by the manager of Bert's and by the shuttle driver, who was a 2016 AT thru-hiker who was forced off the trail by injury here and has been here ever since.

Train and I leapfrogged them through the morning, until they took an extended lunch break just before a particularly rocky section.

This included the knife edge -- yet another feature that wouldn't even have had a name if it had been in Maine and which barely slowed us down. 

After that, the trail reverted to fast and flat forestry roads.

""I will take the rocks of Pennsylvania,"" Train said, ""if most of the trail is like this.""

Four miles after our burgers-with-sarcasm-on-the-side, we reached the Allentown Hiking Club shelter, which shows the lack of effort put into tread quality was inversely proportional to the effort to make the shelters appealing. This one even had a chess board installed on the porch.

The Goldilocks crew were aiming to stay, and Train was meeting a friend of his brother (or some similar kind of two-degrees-of-separation connection) for trail magic the next day.

But I still felt like I had gas in the tank and I wanted to reduce the distance I needed to do the next day to reach Port Clinton, so I pushed on.

Immediately after the shelter, the forestry road ended and the rocks resumed, but some trail crew has spent time arranging them into a smooth surface akin to crazy paving. I took a photo to show that not all the rocks of Pennsylvania are bad.

After that, I used my standard practice of opting for the first decent campsite after 7pm. After passing a few marginal ones shortly before that arbitrary cut-off time, I reached the top of the hill at Dan's Pulpit and found a great site with an outstanding view.

I'd briefly pondered cowboy camping on the rocks but the abortive last cowboy camping experience and the presence of some mosquitoes had me pitching the tent instead.

This decision was vindicated when I turned on my phone and found the clear skies forecast of that morning had been replaced by a thunderstorm warning. Soon after a short sharp storm rolled through, but the accompanying rain didn't even fully wet the tent fly. I heard later from people who were merely a few miles away who were soaked by a massive but highly-localised downpour.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Throughout the AT so far, I've picked up any trash I'd encountered. On sections clearly only hiked by thru-hikers, there was virtually none but anywhere with day hikers -- such as the series of easily-reached lookout crags we walked past today -- there was so much rubbish that I had to stop picking it up...","Palmerton
",Dan's Pulpit,"Aug 19, Sat",22.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576752,"Time doesn't have a lot of meaning on the trail, since it doesn't much matter to us whether we're a hill on a Wednesday or a Saturday. 

Weekends are one example when the outside world interferes in this obliviousness, through the sudden presence of a gazillion joggers and day hikers on the AT, reminding us that the rest of the world operates on a somewhat more regulated schedule.

This was a good thing. My descent from Dan's Pulpit had involved the traditional reward for being first on the trail: an all-you-can-eat buffet of spiderwebs.

But then after a little less than an hour, I met a day hiker coming in the other direction and the way forward was miraculously clear of these examples of arachnid industriousness.

More day hikers and joggers followed. The corollary to sharing the trail with those on a seven-day schedule is that I had to remind myself that day hikers still have that city-dwellers' reticence towards strangers.

With other thru-hikers or LASHers (the official term for""long-ass section hikers""), I'd always chat with them about their experience. With the weekend warriors I'd usually be meet with an expression that comprised puzzlement and outright suspicion.

So be it.

Day hikers weren't the only ones I was sharing the trail with. On a forestry road I found a black rat snake stretched out across the path, its distended abdomen showing it had had a successful night hunting. Clearly it just wanted to lie in the sun and digest without interruption, but it too was learning about the intrusion of the human-derived working week.

At the lookout sites -- the Pinnacles and the Pulpit -- there were also eastern timber rattlers and copperheads enjoying this pleasant sunny day. 

In time the trail wound its way down to below the dam providing Hamburg's drinking water then back up onto the ridge before descending once again to Port Clinton.

This was the end of my day, having arranged to get picked up by Craig of the highly-rated Rock and Sole hostel. 

While I was waiting, I took advantage of the firefighters' social club: a speakeasy where thru-hikers were welcomed as temporary members and could partake of draught beers for $1.25. I was signed in by Squeaky, the local fire chief, and then had some other random locals buy me a beer. Life was good!

If I thought that put the day on an upward trajectory, it was benchmarked by Rock and Sole. 

Craig and Jodi have specialised in running a hiker-focused b&b after he retired from 25 years as a state trooper. For $40, they provided dinner, bed and breakfast, including a ride back up to the trail and to a Dollar General to resupply. 

That was already a bargain but the quality of Jodi's cooking took it to an extra level, as too did the experience of being in a happy family home as opposed to a commercial accommodation experience. 

It was interesting too because I finally had the chance to meet Tinkerbell, a solo sobo woman whose name I'd been seeing in shelter logbooks for more than a month.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: It turned out I'd just missed Dirt, Sweetblood and Sriracha, who left Rock and Sole just as Craig was collecting me. They were once days ahead but I'd slowly closed the distance through some longer days on my part and some shorter days for them. Maybe tomorrow...","Dan's Pulpit

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576754,"Today was a green tunnel day of the kind we'd been warned about for the middle part of the AT but haven't yet experienced. 

But that was ok, because it made today a day to clock miles rather than marvel at the views. Since I didn't start until a leisurely 9am and with the longest day in recent weeks ahead of me, this was a good thing.

As had been the case for most of the past few weeks, the trail followed a long, flat and most featureless ridge. After a few views as I climbed up out of Port Clinton and then again at a lookout in the first half hour, there was nothing to see other than the trees either side.

It was so flat that in the absence of anything elevated to send the trail over unnecessarily -- one of the AT's classic PUDs (pointless ups and downs) -- the trail had to resort to a PDU (pointless down and up) to inflict unnecessary exertion into the process.

Even with that, I don't think there was a climb of more than a couple of hundred feet. Even better, there seemed to be some hikers directly in front of me because I wasn't dining on the usual spider smorgasbord.

Today was also the eclipse day. I'd had mixed luck with eclipses in the past. I traveled to one in China in 2010 but it rained all day. An ocular eclipse in Tanzania last year was also cloudy. I'd thought about travelling into the zone of totality this year but didn't want to jinx everyone else's experience. Instead I had another partial eclipse experience, like the one of had in Nepal in 1995, which was akin to wearing a pair of sunglasses.

I had two deadlines. One was dusk, which in these increasingly equinoxial days was close to 7.30pm, and the other was to get back in time to ensure I didn't miss out on the latest round of Jodi's exceptional home-cooked meals. 

Since I was slackpacking and had had a fairly easy day yesterday, I hoped to be done in time for the nominal 6pm dinner time, but I was also carrying my headlamp in case the terrain proved harder than expected.

But with little to distract me from cruising the miles and with northbounders being increasingly few in number, I managed to knock off nearly 24 miles in a little under nine hours.

For the final two hours of this, the few other people on the trail told me that I was only a few minutes behind Dirt, Sriracha and Sweetblood. Even going at about three and a half miles an hour, I couldn't quite catch them.

Instead I found myself racing against the rumbles of an approaching thunderstorm, and arrived at highway 501 as the skies looked truly threatening.

I sent a quick text to Craig, telling him of my arrival and hoping that he got to the pass before the storm did.

The storm arrived first, but only in the form of a short sharp shower that lasted barely a minute. Craig arrived soon after and we had the chance to chat some more about his state trooper days, which included him telling me how he once broke up an Amish prostitution ring.

""Really?"" I replied, in unveiled surprise.

""Yep,"" he replied with a straight face. ""This woman was having up to six Mennonite...""

I am happy to say that the quality of Jodi's cooking was in reverse proportion to the quality of her husband's jokes!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: When I passed a campsite early on today, I encountered Trouble. He was yet another repeat hiker of the AT, having thru-hiked a few years ago and then having done a yoyo. But like the others -- Grandpa, Mooseburger etc -- they hadn't experienced the other trails before returning once more to the AT. As Trouble explained it, no two hikes were the same and he gave the famous epigram not being able to step in the same river twice. For me it was like going to an amazing restaurant and ordering the same thing every time. Your macaroni cheese might not be exactly like last night's, but it's going to be pretty damn close!","Rock n Sole hostel

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577854,"I'd barely emerged from Craig's car and was yet to start today's hike when I spotted an unfamiliar hiker crossing the road. 

That's how I met Sriracha, and while I was explaining to him how I'd been following his name in hut registers for months I heard a voice behind me cry out: ""Rolling Thunder!""

It was Dirt and Switchback, who I'd last seen nearly 700 miles earlier as we descended the Presidential Range in New Hampshire and had been hoping to catch for weeks.

The extra member of the crew, Sweetblood, was ahead somewhere after making an earlier start. They'd all been staying at 501 shelter, which is famous on the trail partly for being an actual hut rather than a three-sided lean to but mostly because a local pizza restaurant will deliver there.

It was great to catch up as we walked on towards the 1000 mile marker for sobos -- something that had seemed impossibly far-off in those early months in Maine and New Hampshire but was now just four miles away. Despite the momentousness of this landmark, no marker existed for it -- until a week or so ago, when one had been constructed from stones by Scout and Nature Boy.

I still remember reaching the 1000-mile marker on the PCT, which had been after crossing the high Sierra in the big snow year of 2006, and that it was the first time I'd hiked that far. 

There was no equivalent point on the CDT because each group effectively hikes their own variation of the trail, meaning that the 1000-mile marker is different for each group.

Nobody in this group had hiked that far before, and I recognised in them that same feeling I'd felt 11 years earlier.

From there the trail followed along the crest of the ridge, making for fast travel until the ridge ended and dropped down to where a major motorway crossed.

Our little group had been trucking along at this point, enjoying the ability to walk and talk, but when the trail headed steeply downwards, the difference between 20-something and 50-something knees became more apparent and I dropped off their breakneck pace.

I caught them again as the trail headed under the motorway, where some benevolent trail crew has installed some crude benches. The others were in situ, having concluded it was a perfect place for lunch.

As we ate and chatted, three other hikers came the other way: Parkour was celebrating his four-month trailversary today but still hoped to reach Katahdin without flipping, which seemed an ambitious increase in pace. The others with him, Bulk and Johnny Appleseed, seemed more likely to make it.

Would these be our last nobos? It certainly seemed like it, since the others all seemed to have either flipped or skipped from Harper's Ferry.

But I also predicted there would be a truly delusional nobo somewhere behind them, harbouring the notion that Maine will be no more taxing than Maryland.

Dirt, Sriracha, Sweetblood and Switchback were aiming to do 22 miles today and then 25 the day after to reach Duncannon. But since they'd done a series of short days recently and I'd done some long ones, I was aiming at an easier schedule that would get me into town half a day later.

What that meant was I only had to do six more miles to Rausch Gap shelter, while they were aiming for a campsite five miles further, so I opted to stay in the cool of the bridge until the heat of the day had eased a little more.

I farewelled them, but knowing I'd catch them again soon enough when Dirt's mother and cousin arrived to hike to the halfway mark with them. They were a fun group who I'd like to hike with again.

The trail headed through a formerly thriving town, based around coal mining and railway engineering, of which not a single sign remained other than some old road and railway beds.

Even with a 90-minute head start the others had had, I caught them at the shelter, where they'd gone to fill up with water before their climb up to the ridgetop.

I was happy to settle into the deserted shelter, and doubly so when rain began to fall. It quickly turned torrential and unlike nearly all similar previous storms, it went on for the best part of an hour.

Life is good, but I hope it's equally good for the others on top of the ridge, and that they'd got to camp and put their tents up in time...

AT fact of the day: The famous rocks of ""Rocksylvania"" have eased up, with their place seemingly taken by gnats. These have a habit of dive bombing into people's eyes (although for reasons unknown they leave me alone) but the others have adopted a local habit of using Sassafras leaves on their heads as a natural gnat repellant. I don't know if it works, but it definitely looks odd...","Highway 501
",Rausch Gap shelter,"Aug 22, Tue",17.50
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577855,"Today was about water. Too much at the start, and then too little at the end. 

I was fortunate that the ""too much"" part was something I only experienced vicariously, having the serendipity to be in the shelter when a severe and unforecast storm rolled through.

It became clear what I'd missed out on when, within a few minutes of leaving the lean to, I found a family group in a campsite.

""Did you guys stay dry last night?"" Their emotive reaction to my question said more than the words ever could.

It turned out they'd made some rookie camping errors, particularly when it came to choosing tent sites that were flat and smooth. These are usually because they're deposition zones of soil from rainfall.

But one of these had gone one better by unwittingly choosing a tent site directly below a water bar on the trail, so the torrent flowing down the trail was directed to her tent.

""The water was about three or four inches deep and flowing straight into my tent,"" she explained.

I said I'd been surprised none of them had come to the shelter and that I'd been there on my own. They asked if it was far away, and when I said it was less than half a mile, it added an extra layer of suffering to their experience.

But, on the plus side, it seemed the trauma of their evening would mean they were unlikely to make the same mistakes again. Good judgement, the saying goes, comes from experience. And experience, the educative part of the saying continues, usually comes from bad judgment.

Of course all this left me wondering how Sriracha, Sweetblood, Dirt and Switchback had got on last night, since even with their impressive ability to hike at nearly 4mph, they'd have still been short of their intended campsite when the tempest struck.

The topography that was more of what I'd become accustomed to since Connecticut, when the Appalachians became a series of flat level ridges, with the trail alternating between going along these and crossing shallow valleys to go from one ridge to the next one running parallel to it.

The ridge from Rausch Gap was a slight variation on this theme by having a stream running along its length, turning the original single ridge into two. The trail followed the stream, with the benefit that there was the absence of the near-constant backdrop of traffic noise that had been our companion since Connecticut.

The trail itself gently climbed alongside the stream but despite the easy gradient, there was a distinct lack of campsites. But there was plenty of water, including a series of spontaneous springs bubbling out of the ground.

Near the gentle pass at the top of the valley, I went past the campsite where the others had been headed and was surprised to see a mailbox. These are often used to hold trail registers, and inside was one -- including messages from the four.

""Woohoo!"" Switchback had written. ""Rain party!""

Dirt added a few more details, saying they were happy to be in camp and having set up before the worst of the storm hit.

The rest of the day involved dropping off this latest ridge then heading across and onto the next parallel one, to the west. My intended destination was a shelter five miles along the ridge.

There was a spring a few minutes walk off trail, but my guide described an intermittent spring on trail higher up. Having watched all the springs earlier, I was pretty sure this would be flowing so I didn't bother to camel up at the lower one.

And, inevitably, it wasn't. But instead of heading back down, I figured my half litre should probably last me for the five miles to the shelter.

Thanks to mostly being on a level ridge in the shade of the trees, that half litre proved to be enough. Water was available near the shelter, via a 0.2 mile side trail that was notorious for its steepness.

It was indeed as steep as the reputation, but I was more impressed by the effort that went into creating the 300-step rock staircase rather than my personal effort in negotiating it.

I'd got in before 3pm so even with the trek to the spring, I had a leisurely afternoon with the shelter entirely to myself.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: It was only as dusk fell that it seemed like I'd reached a threshold point of my hike: a day without meeting any nobos. There are still hikers heading north, but most of them will flip up to Katahdin from Harper's Ferry, the spiritual halfway point because of the ATC headquarters there, and hike back down again rather than risk being cut off by winter. Now how will we get (accurate) advice about food and hostels and (laughably inaccurate) advice about the trail?","Rausch Gap shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581752,"Nothing demonstrated the fall from grace of the town of Duncannon quite like The Doyle hotel.

This elaborate old building would have been the height of opulence when it was built about 110 years ago but over the decades it -- and the town -- had gone from genteel decline and was now in a state of outright decrepitude. 

This was reflected in the price: $25 a night for a room, which was a quarter of what I'd paid a couple of weeks earlier in New York for a truly meritless hotel next to a trailer park. 

Needless to say, this meant The Doyle was famous on the AT and even though hikers have notoriously low standards, the place was so grimy that its unofficial nickname on the trail was The Doylet.

It was competing with one of the local churches, which took hikers in for free as part of its ministrations to the apparently destitute and homeless. Free is a tough price-point to compete against, which might explain why it seemed like no money had gone into maintenance since the owners, a pair of old hippies called Pat and Vickey Kelly bought it about 15 years ago.

And since my philosophy for this hike has been to collect experiences rather than seek comfort, it seemed ideal. 

That morning I'd hiked along a long, flat, straight and wooded ridgeline that typified the AT in the mid Atlantics, and the only thing breaking up the monotony of this long green tunnel was regularly walking into spider webs, which seemed to be particularly bad on this section. 

This ridge was only broken because, over countless aeons, the Susquehanna River had cut through it. I could see the ridge continuing on the far side of the river, but the trail headed down to cross the river on a highway bridge. Just before descending, the trail offered a view across the river at Duncannon, which from that angle looked more leafy and established than I was expecting.

However any delusional expectation that it would be like the manicured towns of Connecticut quickly dissipated when two strip clubs formed a gateway to the main street. 

It went downhill from there.

The unkempt look of the houses I was walking past on the way into town hinted that this was classic Rust Belt country that had been left behind economically. I later learned that this county voted for Trump over Clinton by more than 3:1, being exactly the kind of place that is susceptible to oversimplistic populist messages by politicians. 

Arriving at The Doyle just before midday, I went to the bar to arrange a room and was surprised to find Pan, who I'd last seen back in Vermont and who I thought was still behind me. Over a cold Yuengling beer, he explained that in New York he'd split from his girlfriend, Tink, and had then done a series of 30-mile days but had come down with a leg injury which had forced him to take some days off in Duncannon. Every stage of that process sounded like it sucked .

After all this, I had lunch and got to meet Pat and Vickey, who were friendly and quirky in equal measure, making them amusing to chat to. They hooked me up with what had once been a grand room but which now looked like a flophouse, which was exemplified by the bottom rail of the wooden window having at some point fallen off and disappeared. From the appearance of the wood around the missing part, this did not seem to have happened in recent years.

But it was comfortable enough and the ceilings were high enough for the room temperature to be pleasant. It was a fine place to chill for a few hours before attending to the only other thing on my day's agenda: dinner and beer at the bar.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The Doyle is used to hikers and whether nobo, sobo or flip-flopping, they'll have been on the trail long enough to earn an appetite. Despite this, the cook did his best to talk me out of ordering a large fries because he doubted I'd be able to finish them and the cheeseburger I'd ordered. Ha! As if.","Peter's Mountain shelter
","Duncannon, PA","Aug 24, Thu",11.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581816,"For once, it seemed the nobos had been right: Duncannon appeared to mark the southern extent of “Rocksylvania”, as Pennsylvania’s notoriously stony trail tread was derogatorily dubbed.

Once I’d descended into the Cumberland valley, the trail proved to be fast, flat and easy, putting me on course to do my biggest day yet – and that’s when I encountered the “Trip hazard ahead” sign.

Seriously? After about 150 miles since Delaware Water Gap in which the rocky trail tread meant tripping was a constant hazard, why on earth did they put this sign here?

The reason turned out to be bureaucratic. Some kind of cable passed across the trail and since this potential hazard was of human rather than natural origin, the risk had to be mitigated by being covered by a mat and then further nullified by this sign. 

In a way, it made sense. If I tripped over this, I could sue the utility company. If I tripped on one of the roughly three gazillion loose rocks elsewhere on the trail, I’d have to sue God – and he’d proven to be notoriously difficult to serve a summons. 

As with most prognostications by nobos, I wasn’t entirely sure whether to believe their reports about the trail improving, which is why I snuck out of The Doyle(t) hotel around 6.30am. I then wandered across the road to a diner to stock up on cholesterol and carbs and hiked out of town at 7.30am – one of my earliest starts yet.

I knew there was a solid climb up to Hawks Crag to start the day, but my hopes of making fast progress weren’t aided when I saw a signpost pointing towards “Hawks Crag” but the white blazes went a different way, along the road. I opted to follow the blazes, which led to a parking lot from which the trail headed steeply uphill but then steeply back downhill to meet the original trail marked by the signpost. The AT presumably took its detour because of the paucity of car parking at the original site.

The Awol guide also talked about the climb being “very rocky” but in comparison to the benchmark set by the rest of the AT in Rocksylvania so far, the trail was beautifully constructed and a joy to walk.

Once back on the top of the long, flat, wooded ridgeline, it was back to business as usual -- which was not surprising since this was the same ridge I’d been following for days until the gap cut by the Susquehanna River forced the trail briefly down to Duncannon. I’d been almost identical ridges for hundreds of miles.

But it was clear the topography was changing. Soon after this, the trail dropped down to about 18 miles of gloriously flat easy hiking through the Cumberland valley before heading back up into hills that were less regular and basically more like normal rolling mountains. 

When I dropped into Darlington shelter, just before the descent into the valley, I ran into a young sobo called Scout whose life mission was to catch up with the other Scout, whose progress he had been following through the hut registers for hundreds of miles. 

I told him he was only a few days behind him, but young Scout’s pace had led to him succumbing to shin splints which seemed likely to thwart his aspirations just as he was closing in on his nominative doppelganger.

The hut register was full of nobos cursing the brutality of the ascent out of the valley to the ridgeline, which I took mean that the way ahead was very very easy. And it was. The hill was beautifully switchbacked and then segued into beautiful trail through the gently rolling hills of the valley.

The rest of the day was very fast, threading through paddocks and cornfields and occasionally crossing busy motorways via overpasses. Usually the cost of easy walking through agricultural areas comes in the form of contaminated water, but a spigot at a farm building run by the ATC meant I didn’t have to worry about filtering my water. 

I was starting to flag a little towards the 22-mile mark, which was when I found a cheap polystyrene cooler at one of the road crossings. The cheapness of the cooler is usually directly correlated to the infrequency of it being stocked, which is why I fully expected to find it empty other than the discarded wrappers of those with better timing. 

But the cooler had just been restocked and offered a series of treats that were chilled with ice. Thank you, @makaylapaige. Your timing was immaculate.

I had been a little worried about getting to Boiling Springs in time but walked into the town at 4.15pm. It took about a nanosecond to realise this was the polar opposite to Duncannon and this was a village as immaculate and middle class as any in Connecticut.

I called Lisa, who runs a low-key hiker hostel on their 5 acre smallholding on the outskirts of town. For $20, she collected me from town, provided food to cook for dinner and breakfast, a hot shower in their home and a bed in an outbuilding. I had the place to myself, making this possibly the best bargain on the trail so far. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Once I knew I was going to get to town at a reasonable hour, I turned on my phone to check for messages, since my parents are of an age and condition where I have to be ready for bad news. They were fine but bad news came instead from another source: a friend from Abu Dhabi who’d recently lost his job in the latest round of cuts prompted by low oil prices had had a massive heart attack at home in Britain and had died. One of the odd things about expat life is that you see people one day and then not the next, whether for relocation or, as in this case, death. It was odd to think that I’d never be able to catch up with Tony again in the UK or some other expat posting.","Duncannon, PA

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581835,"It began promisingly and with so much hope and commitment, but as the halfway mark grew nearer the toll began to tell and some fell by the wayside. 

That's an accurate comment about the AT in general, with about three quarters of those who start a thru-hike failing to complete it. But today this dynamic played out in microcosm via the medium of ice cream.

Sriracha and Sweetblood were attempting one of the more venerable of the AT’s innumerable traditions: the half gallon challenge. This is where hikers strive to eat half a gallon of ice cream at Pine Grove Furnace State Park to commemorate reaching the halfway mark on the trail. 

It seemed a little contrived for sobos, partly because we hadn’t yet hit the halfway mark of the trail and weren’t due to do so until tomorrow. But a challenge is a challenge and they were up for it.

It began well, even though the recent passage of so many hikers and the state park’s store running down its stock ahead of the impending end of the summer season meant the only flavour available in half-gallon containers was mint chocolate. 

And because the half gallon tubs of ice cream don’t actually contain half a gallon, an extra pint was required to make sure the actual amount ingested was the full measure. At least there was a better range of flavours available in the pint size but together the challenge cost $10, also making it a good little earner for the state park store.

Sriracha approached the task like, well, like a thru-hiker. Sweetblood did her best but less than halfway into the first tub was struggling and hadn’t reached the two-thirds point when Sriracha downed the final swallow of his supplementary pint.

Victory came at a price, however, and the inevitable thermal consequences of ingesting half a gallon of ice cream in the space of 32 minutes meant he was soon shivering with mild hypothermia. 

Sweetblood, meanwhile, ended up face down on the table. Defeated! 

But the Newtonian nature of the universe was confirmed and for every action (Sweetblood’s inability to eat more ice cream) there was a balancing reaction (Dirt descended onto the remaining ice cream like a seagull on French fries). 

I’d hoped to catch up to Sriracha and crew that day as I left Lisa’s low-key hiker hostel that morning. They’d hiked ahead a few days before as we approached Duncannon but I knew Dirt’s mother and cousin were coming out to hike with them for a few days so their mileage was going to decrease enough for me to catch them.

Lisa’s husband drove me back into town to get back on the trail, earning what I hope were some serious marital credits for allowing her to sleep in on this day, a Saturday. 

 I’d seen some tangential comments about Denali in the register at the hostel and asked him about it and was told he’d attempted it twice, unsuccessfully, and was aiming to have a third go when he retired in a few years time. We talked about my solo ascent of it back in 2008 and how Juicy Fruit, another 2017 sobo who Lisa had tried to entice back to the hostel after spotting him in town while picking me up, had climbed it just before starting the AT. (No wonder Maine didn’t hold any terrors for him!) 

The pleasantness of the trail through the Cumberland valley went up another notch as the AT went straight through the middle of Boiling Springs, which was possibly the most civilised, polished and beautified village I’d seen this side of the cover of a box of chocolates. 

Even when it emerged into the fields surrounding the town, the grade and trail tread remained entirely civilised and the ascent into the hills to Center Point Knob beyond was gently graded, even though this was a return to normal mountains instead of the long flat straight ridges I’d been following for nearly a month.

This was also just before the start of the university year and I ran into a couple of university groups doing pre-orientation leadership courses in the woods, which served as a reminder of how overwhelmingly white the general hiking community tends to be.

Crossing a wooded valley on the far side of the mountain, I ran into Dirt, Sweetblood, Dirt’s mother Scarlet and cousin Sandy, who were moving at a gentle pace with plenty of breaks as befits the latter pair’s absence of trail fitness. Sriracha and Switchback had been hiking with them but had gone ahead.

The terrain proved to be nearly as featureless as the long flat ridges of recent weeks, even if the actual topography was a little more varied. This was definitely the long green tunnel, in which there were few if any views and the only interest came from occasional brief but convoluted routes through what the guide described as “rock gardens”. It was an easy place to make miles.

I later passed Young Scout, who was hobbling heavily after aggravating his nascent shin splints by doing a 25-mile hike the previous day. There was nothing nascent about his shin splints now and he had already resigned himself to taking a day off instead of trying to abide by his original schedule of meeting his family in Harpers Ferry in a few days time.

Notwithstanding his goal to catch Old Scout, this seemed both wise and inevitable. Just watching him hobble felt painful.

He wasn’t assisted by the trail tread, which deteriorated for most of the second half of the day into an unwelcome return of “Rocksylvania”. But in the final few miles towards Pine Grove Furnace State Park, it improved again to follow an old forestry road and then an old railway bed that was so ridiculously smooth and flat that it was busy with families on bicycles.

At a lake, complete with a patrolled swimming beach, the trail became sealed for the final half mile or so to the state park store. I’d hoped to visit the AT museum here but missed the closing time by half an hour so instead I wandered over to the store, where Switchback was devouring a burger, which was an impressive feat given that he’d completed the half gallon challenge only an hour earlier. This was a boy who could both hike and eat at a level that was wondrous to behold!

He headed on soon after, only narrowly missing the arrival of Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt. They’d headed off ahead of Dirt’s mother and cousin so they could get to the store before it shut at 4pm.

After their mixed fortunes at the half gallon challenge, they waited around for the others to arrive while I wandered over to the neighbouring Ironmasters Lodge, which was the former forge master’s stately residence but which now served as a kind of hostel. For $35, they offered dinner, bed and breakfast. Three nights in a row of a bed and a shower? Embrace the civility! 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Switchback was trying to meet his mother in Front Royal, about 160 miles away, in seven days. He’d decided to do this by hiking 10 miles yesterday (so he could spend time with Dirt’s mother and cousin), 20 miles today, and then 30 miles tomorrow. This schedule would put him in place to attempt the four-state challenge, another AT tradition in which hikers try to do in one day the 44 miles from the Pennsylvania border, through Maryland and West Virginia, to the Virginia border. Since Switchback had already done the much tougher Connecticut challenge – doing the 52 miles in one day, along much more difficult terrain – this didn’t seem likely to tax him especially. After that, he aimed to reverse this fartlek-style hiking schedule by doing 30 miles, 20 miles and then 10 miles into Front Royal. Madness! But he was fit enough for this to be a feasible objective...","Boiling Springs, PA

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581849,"Woah, we’re halfway there.

Woah, livin’ on a prayer.

Take my hand, we’ll make it I swear.

It was no surprise that one particular Bon Jovi song was on my internal playlist today. This archetypal hair-band power ballad from 1986 might have an ironic appeal in 2017 but we were indeed now “halfway there” on our hike from Katahdin to Springer.

This was not a singular event. Yesterday we’d had the halfway ritual of the half gallon challenge. A couple of miles into today’s hike, we came upon the elaborate formal halfway marker which, because of the way the total trail length keeps increasing as more switchbacks are added to the southern half of the AT, is about four miles short of the actual halfway point.

And then we had the real halfway point, which features a much more modest sign which is moved around each year based on the exact length of the trail, which was 2181.0 miles at the time of the formal halfway marker’s construction but which is now 2189.5 or so. 

Just how much this has changed over the years had been shown the previous day, when I ran into a group of day hikers north of Pine Grove Furnace State Park. They were looking for the halfway marker, which one of them remembered from 15 years or so before had been on this trail. I set them straight and said it was now in the opposite direction from the state park headquarters.

For our little troupe of Sriracha, Sweetblood, Dirt, Dirt’s mother Scarlet and cousin Sandy, it meant something extra: the end of Scarlet and Sandy’s brief hike with them. Their car was parked a few metres away from the 2017 halfway marker at Dead Woman’s Hollow Rd. 

More importantly, they’d bought a 30-pack of PBR, a bottle of vodka and stuffed them with lots of ice in a cooler in the back of their car, so they could celebrate. Even after several days, the beers were still cold. Better still, they were kind enough to include me.

I’d run into them again about an hour into today’s hike and hiked with them to the halfway point, which provided the chance to get to know all of them a little better. Scarlet and Sandy were doing exceptionally well for people who were trying to hike alongside those who had a 1000 miles of trail fitness.

It also confirmed that Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt are a fun group with whom I was hoping to hike some more, which was ironic because having just caught up with them again I had to hike on ahead because I was trying to get to Harpers Ferry in a few days time so I could go down to Washington DC to visit a friend I’d known from Abu Dhabi. I knew Sriracha was aiming to do the four-state challenge and figured they’d catch up again. 

Despite the deleterious effect on hiking aspirations of trying to empty the 30-pack and bottle of vodka, we gave it a solid shot and then packed out the rest with us. I had three cans but Sriracha stuffed half a dozen or so into the mesh pocket on the back of his pack. I might have lost any ultralight cred I might have (which isn’t much), but it seemed that each of our respective campsights would be convivial.

After watching a heartwarming display of familial affection between Dirt and her mother as they prepared to part ways, I headed off down the trail because I was aiming to get to Route 30 that night.

The AT remained in green tunnel mode for the rest of the day but that was at least conducive to cranking out the miles. By 5pm or so, I reached Quarry Gap shelter, which was renown as one of the nicest on the AT.

Some benevolent caretaker had really gone to town on the place, which featured a series of improvements such as a swing chair, hanging flower pots overflowing with blooms, the best spring I’d seen in weeks and even a two section shelter, which I automatically assumed would be divided into Snoring and Non-Snoring. 

As I arrived I encountered Lapsang and Footprint. I’d been following the latter, a young Austrian woman who’d hiked the PCT the year before, in the log books for months and she’d been just ahead of me for a long time. Lapsang was her boyfriend but who was only meeting her on weekends because of the demands of having a job.

It turned out I’d just missed the mysterious benefactor of this shelter, who’d they said had left shortly before my arrival but only after pointing out to Lapsang and Footprint the various edible mushrooms growing on fallen trees nearby.

Lapsang was wondering if I had any oil to fry the mushrooms. I didn’t but I offered them a still-cold PBR from my pack, which prompted his eyes to open wide in a mix of delight and surprise. 

I was really tempted to stay but I’d only started this leg with a few days food and needed to resupply in Fayetteville tonight for the final section into Harpers Ferry.

After half an hour for a stop I’d envisaged would only last five minutes, I reluctantly booked it down the trail and reached the road shortly before dusk. There was a new diner about 0.4 miles down the road, to which I walked and sated my carb and cholesterol needs before calling the phone number associated with the Trail of Hope hostel in Fayetteville.

The guidebook suggested they would take hikers to resupply on the way to the hostel and the man on the phone offered to do that. It took much longer than it should for me to twig that the hostel was not a commercial venture but a Christian one, with the $22 fee going to fund the associated church’s outreach programme for the community. Like a depressing number of other towns along the east coast, this area had a raging opiod problem. My driver was a church volunteer.

But he amenably drove me to a Dollar General to resupply and then dropped me at the hostel before heading back home. The hostel was entirely empty so I had the whole place to myself.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The question of when we’d meet our last nobo had been on our minds for some time but despite the five day gap since Parkour’s group, I predicted we would meet a truly delusional nobo who remained convinced they could reach Katahdin without flipping or skipping. I was somewhat disturbed to be proved right by encountering Tree, who said he had a hard deadline of October 9 when he had to be back in California – even shorter than Parkour’s ambitious aim to complete his hike by Baxter State Park’s nominal closing date of October 22. Tree hadn’t even got to the halfway point and despite taking months to get to here was predicting he could “pull 30s through Maine” and complete his goal. I thought back to when I was struggling to do a mile an hour through parts of Maine but kept my counsel to myself, offering instead a simple: “Well, good luck.”","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581875,"I’m done with these Yankees. I want all y’all to know I’m now officially in the South.

That was the effect of crossing the Mason-Dixon line, which was the arbitrary historical boundary between the north and the south. On the ground it didn’t mean much -- what was I expecting? Banjos?

But in the grander scheme of things, it’s yet more proof that there is actually an end in sight – just -- for this grand adventure on the AT.

And like a lot of things pertaining to the eastern US, this was something about which I knew very little – to the extent that it was only when I googled the history of this boundary that I discovered it wasn’t actually the “Mason-Dixie” line, as I’d thought for the best of half a century!

I’m guessing I just wasn’t having a very sharp day. For days, I’d known that right on the Maryland border was Penmar Park and pondered on whether the origin of the name was Welsh, since Pen is a familiar suffix that means the top of something. Penmar Park is a prominent viewpoint which was once one of the most popular resorts in the eastern US, attracting up to 20,000 people a day, so “pen” could well have been an apt moniker. 

It was only when I arrived that it finally dawned on me that it was simply a portmanteau made up of the first three letters respectively of Pennsylvania and Maryland... “It’s probably good that I’m not operating heavy machinery at present,” I muttered to myself and continued to hike southwards.

It helped that today was not a day that required much mental agility. As it has done for weeks, the AT followed long flat forested and mostly viewless ridgetops that were what were left of the 500 million year old Appalachian mountains. These mountains were once as big as the Rockies but such are the vicissitudes of life and/or erosion that now they get no higher than 2000ft for hundreds of miles.

From the Trail of Hope hostel, I went back to the diner for a suitably hearty breakfast and then headed back into the hills. I always hike better with town food in my stomach and this food fuelled me for the first 10 miles of the day.

This took me to yet another excellent shelter that had been showered with benevolence and effort from one family, which had been maintaining it since the the 1990s. There were lots of things to like about it but none more than the signs on the two separate shelters, which read “Snoring” and “Non-snoring”.

Then it was back into the long green tunnel again for the rest of the way to the Maryland border, which I reached in late afternoon.

My erstwhile hiking buddy Train hailed from Maryland and had hiked all 44 miles of the AT in the state, saying several times while we were traversing the rocks of northern Pennsylvania that the Maryland section was much nicer.

So it was something of a shock when the trail continued on the southern side of Penmar Park as it had been north side of the border, which is to say the AT standard of rocky and rough, even if it was not as bad as the worst bits of Rocksylvania.

But I only had a few more miles to do to get to Raven Rock shelter, my destination for the night. 

The only person present was a grey-haired woman, who was a sobo section hiker from Washington DC. Shortly after I arrived, Juicy Fruit and Suches walked up – as was becoming a frequent occurrence, I’d thought they were way ahead of me only to find they were behind. 

Even if the trail was not an improvement, the quality of the shelters in Maryland certainly improved. This was a big, new double-decker shelter with an expansive covered area in front and bear cables nearby for hanging our food.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The woman at the shelter turned out to be a former peace corps volunteer who went on to work for USAid, the foreign aid branch of the US government. She proved to be good company, particularly once we worked out that we’d both been to some fairly obscure locations, such as Somalia. She seemed a little shocked that I’d gone there on holiday compared to her own experience of having a squad of armed guards with her at all times.","Fayetteville, PA

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581904,"""I have never seen a mass of such filthy, strong-smelling men. Three in a room would make it unbearable. The filth that pervades them is most remarkable... They have become so inured to hardships that they care but little for any of the comforts of civilisation. They are the toughest set of creatures I ever saw, their features, hair and clothing matted with dirt and filth, and the scratching they kept up have warrant of vermin in abundance...""

Thru-hikers, right? But this is a quote from an anonymous citizen of Maryland about the Confederate soldiers who crossed into their state early in the US civil war.

The parallels with the modern-day hordes of thru hikers plying the Appalachian Trail 155 years later was an obvious one, and the people who'd featured this quote on a roadside interpretive display seemed fully aware of it. The mural was headlined: ""19th century backpacker.""

There are many reasons why I was glad not to be doing the four-state challenge but one was because I would have missed the chance to take in the details of the Civil War battlefields that were literally under our feet.

I hadn't known much about the conflict beyond the broad strokes of what happened, so the details of this battle, and how it fitted into the overall trajectory of the civil war, made it seem rather more real and less like something from a dusty history textbook.

It also added an extra level of interest to another day in the long green tunnel on – you guessed it – long flat forested ridgelines that rarely offered views. 

The forecast was for rain from 11am or so, and in the hope of getting as much of today’s hike in before that meant I was up before dawn and hoisted my pack onto my shoulders around 7.30am. 

And immediately felt the first spots of rain. “Seriously?” I asked the clouds, but they didn’t reply. 

The rain was just nuisance drizzle rather than anything serious and I didn’t bother putting on my rain jacket for the few miles to the next hut, where the residents – an eclectic collection of section hikers -- had opted for a leisurely start to the day. One was another former Peace Corps volunteer aged in her late thirties who seemed a little uncomfortable in her own skin and was aiming to hike for a few weeks into the southern Shenandoahs, not least of which as a means of putting off making a decision about what to do with her life. 

In the half hour I was there chatting, Juicy Fruit and Suches walked past without stopping and the rain got heavier, prompting me to don my rain jacket before continuing. At least the trail was notably kinder than it had been in northern Pennsylvania and instead of going on the slow and rocky absolute crest of the ridgeline, it tended to follow old logging roads just to one side, which made for much faster and more pleasant progress.

Another session in the rain took me to Pine Knob Shelter, where there were yet more people sheltering from the rain and seemingly in no hurry to get out into it. 

Two separate solo section hikers were particularly memorable. 

One was a middle-aged guy called Skittles who would park his car then do hikes along the AT from it. He was the epitome of the low-skills hiker who'd seemingly bought into the uber-macho image of backpacking: he had an enormous pack and was carrying a hatchet and also a huge knife, on the scabbard of which was another smaller knife. Possibly as a manifestation of this macho expectation, he’d got a fire going, for which I was certainly grateful.

The other was Plus One, a middle-aged woman hiking with her dog and who was applying a thick layer of mascara as I approached the shelter. Seriously? She had an enormous pack and was also carrying a conventional handbag, which contained things like full bottles of shampoo. She was even louder and brasher than her makeup choices would have predicted. 

The other pair were a father and daughter out for a few days and whose rolled eyes whenever Plus One’s volume or brashness reached peak levels expressed their desire to get out of here. I concurred and fortunately the rain ended, leaving a drearily overcast but otherwise dry day.

Just after crossing an interstate highway via a full-enclosed overbridge is when I started to reach areas rich in Civil War history. This began with the original Washington Monument, erected by the townsfolk in honour of George Washington and which was now one of four towers to claim that title. This one was considerably smaller than the more famous one in Washington DC but this one had a staircase going to the top for the view, although the benefits were pretty marginal on this grey day.

At the parking lot directly below was an interpretive centre to the battles that had occurred here on September 14, 1862, which I went into primarily to dry out a little but which then helped me make sense of the battle sites I was about to walk through in the next couple of hours. 

In short, the Confederate forces were hoping for a quick victory that would bring a swift end to the Civil War but Union forces won the day, albeit in a way that didn't vanquish the rebel side either, with the result that the conflict waged on for another three years or so.

At each of the two main sites, near South Mountain, it was odd to think about the literal blood under my feet in what was now seemed to be idyllic pastoral scenes. 

I hiked on another couple of miles to the next shelter, which was another luxurious double-storey affair like last night’s one. Besides a section hiking couple who marvelled at my ability to hike in trail runners, there was an enormous group of university students from some expensive private Catholic college who were on an orientation hike before starting the academic year.

It would have been really easy for the youthful enthusiasm to combine with the size of the group to dominate the shelter, but these guys – or at least the group leaders -- were particularly self-aware and at pains to prevent that happening. It was heartening to see. They also tried and failed to get a fire going, so I offered some of my denatured alcohol to get it started. After all, by this time tomorrow I was going to be in Harpers Ferry, where I could restock.

Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581944,"”I’m hiking the AT,” I explained. “I think I’m supposed to drop in here?”

The staffer at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy beckoned me outside, where he photographed me against a backdrop I’d seen in a gazillion other thru-hikers’ photos. The resulting photo went into a binder of similar images of nobo, sobo and flip flopping AT hikers.

This is how I discovered I was the 32nd sobo to have reached what’s known as the spiritual halfway point of the trail, in the historic township of Harpers Ferry.

This was the final of the long series of halfway points on the AT, beginning with the half gallon challenge, the formal halfway marker, the accurate halfway marker, crossing fom the North to the South on the Mason-Dixon line and now this, the spiritual halfway point of the Applachian Trail because of the presence of the ATC. 

I was surprised that Juicy Fruit and Suches, hikers who go way faster than my geriatric pace, were not in the book ahead of me, but they rocked up to the ATC about an hour after I’d arrived and while I was enjoying a rest in the hiker lounge. 

Not for the first time, I used the phrase: ”I was sure you were ahead of me?” They said they got sick of walking in the rain the day before so they’d hitched into a town at a road crossing after they’d last seen me because there was said to be free massages offered to thru-hikers from some kind of therapy school. Alas their timing was off and they picked the one day it was closed, although they were able to have a free hot tub session.

We wandered back into town together and found a burger place for lunch and a pint, then booked into the bunkhouse at The Town’s Inn, run with quirky charm by a former Texan academic, Karan. 

Even though the 16+ miles we did today is roughly six times what the average American walks each day, it was a short day by our standards and felt like a rest day, especially when my specific goal after a few longer days is to do absolutely nothing other than lounge around for the rest of the afternoon. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We’d barely finished our burgers and might have been on to a second beer when Juicy Fruit, Suches and I looked at each other and all said words to the effect of “Is it wrong to already be hungry again?” Hiker hunger is certainly kicking in.","Rocky Run shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582010,"I was hiking along late in the day when I saw someone striding towards me who clearly had the thru-hiker look. 

It was only when he got closer that I twigged it was Goose, an Australian flip flopper who I’d last seen in central Maine on his northbound hike from Harpers Ferry. Most people doing this opt to return to Harpers Ferry and head south to Springer but he was one of only a handful who did both sections northbound.

This in turn meant he had only a couple more hours of hiking to finish the AT, but he seemed relieved rather than excited by the prospect of being done. 

Goose explained how he’d split up from his girlfriend in Australia while on the trail and, since Springer, had hiked on his own for weeks at a time then took to doing 30-mile days -- both of which generally combine to produce the dead-eyed resignation we saw in so many nobos early on.

But he was also looking forward to the future and had a 12-month US visa, which meant he could do the ski season here, particularly since there was no girlfriend back home to whom he needed to return. He seemed guardedly optimistic, which was good.

Taking time to have an extended chat with Goose was a little at odds with an afternoon in which I was trying to crank out the miles, but I was glad I did. 

By the time I stopped a few hours later, I’d done just under 17 miles for the day, which was remarkable given that I hadn’t got back on the trail until lunchtime. 

The delayed start was because train services between Harpers Ferry and Washington DC work fine -– if you’re a commuter. Apart from the daily Amtrak service, there are two commuter trains into DC in the morning and then two back in the late afternoon. 

After leaving Sara’s home, I took the metro to Rockville and then took an Uber from there to Harpers Ferry, getting back on the trail at 12.30pm. After a solid climb up from the river, the trail headed along the undulated ridgeline and stayed there.

Within a few miles, I’d found the border sign for Virginia, my 11th state and the end point for the sobos trying to do the four-state challenge of going from Pennsylvania to Virginia via the 44 miles of Maryland and West Virginia. You could almost feel the relief echoing from the hills, or maybe it was the lingering apprehension of the nobos who were about to begin?

My goal for the evening was to get to a notorious section of trail dubbed the Roller Coaster, where the trail veers off the ridgetop and instead goes up and down over a dozen or so ancillary ridges on the western side. You could even buy a T-shirt locally, saying: “I survived the Roller Coaster.”

The shadows were beginning to lengthen when I got to a sign plonked apparently in the middle of nowhere: “You are about to enter the Roller Coaster. Have a great ride!”

It was a little difficult to know what to make of it. We’d been getting similar well-intentioned drastic warnings from nobos almost since the day we started, but ever since exiting the Whites in New Hampshire, they had all proven to be universally overhyped.

I knew that a certain degree of humility is prudent on long hikes, as in any part of life, so I tried not to dismiss the difficulties of the Roller Coast too blithely, so I figured it would be best to wait and see. 

Half a mile or so after the sign I reached the spring I’d been aiming for and was happy to find it was flowing well and that there were campsites nearby. Just as I set up the tent, the first drops of rain began to fall and the last bit of light faded away.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We’d been warned that anyone who had become accustomed to regularly knocking off state boundaries would need to steel themselves for Virginia, the longest state and taking a full one quarter of the trail. The AT even had a term, the “Virginia blues”, for the discouragingly long time it took to cover the state’s 550 miles. I suspected anyone who suffered from the Virginia blues might struggle on the PCT, where the California section is 1,750 miles long. That took me three and a half months –- longer it’d taken to cross into my 11th state on the AT.","Washington DC

Like most of the stories I’d heard about the AT before hiking it, the profusion of rats has proven to be a bit overhyped. (The snorers bit isn’t exaggerated, though, and most shelters host nightly snorchestras. This includes me, which is another reason why I generally tend to avoid shelters and camp instead.)

But on a grey, chilled and drizzly day, all such considerations are relegated into second place and the hiking world descends on whatever shelter is on offer.

Today was just such a day, although I managed to miss hiking in the rain entirely through the cunning method of not getting out of my tent until after 1pm, by which time the rain had stopped. And then I only hiked about four miles to what turned out to be one of the nicest places on the entire trail: Bear’s Den hostel.

On the PCT and CDT I probably would have sucked it up and hiked through the rain but everything has changed with the advent of smartphones and the existence of five bars of reception at my campsite, which I meant that I knew this weather front was due to blow through rather than stick around.

That and I received a message from Sriracha and Sweetblood, who I thought were half a day ahead of me, that they were actually behind me and were heading to the Bear’s Den from their stealth campsite just outside of Harpers Ferry. 

I finally emerged from my tent just as members of Three Goldilocks and the Bear passed by to get water from the spring. They too said they were heading to Bear’s Den. Packing up a wet tent reminded me why it was good to seek more substantial shelter on wet nights.

As has been the case throughout the mid Atlantic section of the AT, there haven’t been many views from the long green tunnel and today the few times it would have been an option, the only views on offer were of clouds. At one such overlook, I met a mother and son pair who were aiming to hike the whole AT, after which he was going to keep going, like a modern-day Peter Jenkins, all the way to California on foot.

With just four miles to do and the Bear’s Den being closed until 5pm, I took a half-mile detour down to the Horseshoe Curve restaurant, sited on the inside corner of a hairpin bend of the old road that was now superceded by a big new highway. 

I went for burgers and beer, enticed by discovering I’m now apparently within the sphere of influence of Devil’s Backbone Brewery’s products. The brewery itself is famous for being, well, a brewery and also for being super hiker-friendly and letting hikers camp for free in the woods next door.

But it turned out the restaurant was run by a former DC couple, the man of whom had a long career in the CIA, specialising in counterterrorism. Just from the tiny fraction of stories I heard, he would have been a good person to arrange a much longer session. 

In time I wandered back up the road and the one mile further to Bear’s Den, arriving half an hour before it opened but finding a dozen or so people inside in one bunkroom that was open, enjoying the heat, warmth and, if I recall correctly, a really terrible 1980s movie playing on the VCR.

When the hostel opened, I was able to snaffle a bed and discovered that the much rumoured inclusive package – a bed, a soda, a tub of ice cream, a large pizza, laundry and all-you-can-eat make your own pancakes in the morning for $30 – was reality rather than just cruel hearsay. That was a very easy decision.

Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt rocked up in time, the latter of whom talked about heading on to a sodden campsite in another mile or so. This seemed to be for financial reasons – a corollary of most sobos being new college grads – but after enjoying the warmth of the hostel and seeing the drizzle return outside, sense outweighed cents and she booked a room.

The rest of the evening was an enjoyable catch up with that they’d been up to, along with Three Goldilocks and the Bear and a gaggle of people from the DC area who were just up for a few days.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The lodge was originally a summer home to escape the stifling heat of the plains below and was lavishly constructed in stone for a local couple. He was a doctor and she was an opera singer, which was why one end of the lounge involved a curved row of windows to aid the acoustics for which she held concerts. After falling into disuse, it eventually was bought by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.","Rocky Branch spring

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582044,"As I reached the top of the hill, I found Sweetblood and Dirt lounging in the sun on an open grassy patch, enjoying the view. It was a truly idyllic location.

”What would make this even better?” I asked them.

The usual answers came forth. Most of these, as befits being on the second half of a thru-hike, tended to revolve around food.

”What about cold beer?”

And then before they could say anything else, I produced three cans of cold beer from my pack. 

This is something I’ve managed to do at some point on my other two thru-hikes, thanks to my personal capacity for shamelessly soliciting trail magic from strangers in a way that blurs the boundary between yogi-ing and downright begging. What can I say? It’s my super power.

The best part is always the look of incomprehension on the recipients’ faces. “But... but... how...?”

I explained how I'd suspected the odd chalk markings on the trail we’d been following for the past hour had been left by a hash house harriers group, an international organisation that was started after WWII by British officers in what was then Malaya who sought to recover from their weekend hangovers through exercise. The movement had since spread to all seven continents and its adherents describe themselves members of “a drinking club with a running problem”. I’d been a member of one such branch in Abu Dhabi and that was the connection with Sara, who I’d just visited in DC.

As we climbed the hill after crossing Virginia Route 50, I fell behind – as usual, and as befits hiking with people well under half my age -- and was on my own as the chalk markings became increasingly fresh. When I reached a trail junction and found a group wearing mildly risqué T-shirts, I asked if they were hashers. They were. Being hashers, one of them had hauled up a pack containing a bin liner filled with ice and cans of beer. Did I want one?

They were kind enough to extend this offer to beers for Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt as well, although I suspect the unfortunate designated beer carrier was happy to lighten his load.

All of which led, about 15 minutes later, to Sweetblood and Dirt’s surprised expressions. To be fair, it took them about a nanosecond to get on board with the idea of drinking cold beer while sitting in the sun on a patch of grass.

We’d set off that morning from Bear’s Den hostel as the last bit of overnight drizzle was replaced serendipitously by clear blue skies, leading Dirt to announce that she’d definitely made the right call in opting to pay to sleep inside. After an initial chuckle at a sign that read “To AT. To rocks.” -- and a discussion about how much more appropriate this would have been in northern Pennsylvania -- we embarked on the second half of the Roller Coaster. 

To be entirely honest, the Roller Coaster was barely distinguishable from the rest of the trail and although the last two ridges involved solid climbs, every single metre of it seemed better than the average trail we’d encountered in New England.

In the midst of the Roller Coaster, we encountered Plus One at a shelter. After seeing her and Skittles at a shelter north of Harpers Ferry, she said he’d been stalking her. Indeed some of the others hiking around us heard him talking about her as “my girl”, even though they’d barely interacted. Sweetblood and Dirt also hiked with her while Sriracha was doing the four-state challenge because she was too scared to hike alone and she’d tried to enlist park rangers at Harpers Ferry to her aid.

There was, I suspected, a fair few shades of grey in this and what might mostly kindly be called her erratic manner meant it’s possible she had added two and two to get seven. But similarly there was no doubt that her fear was genuine and heartfelt.

I noted also that while most of our group had hiked the short side trail to the shelter, one of our group had heard her voice – let’s just say it’s pretty shrill and carries far – and immediately turned around to continue hiking the trail.

I was still wondering exactly where the truth lay in all this as we hiked past another important point on the trail, where we had 1000 miles left to Springer mountain. I was expecting this important nobo landmark to be commemorated in some way, such as “1000” created through rocks or something similar, but there was nothing.

It was soon after that when I found a circle marked in green chalk on the trail and wondered if this might be a hash trail, although that seemed entirely unlikely. But then more familiar hash markings followed, including “BVC” at the highway crossing, urging hashers to be very careful.
And then soon after that, I was surprising the others with cold beers.

There were another few miles to our intended destination for the night, which was a brand new double-decker lean to called Whiskey Creek shelter, which replaced a still extant but much smaller and mankier lean to called Dick’s Dome shelter. We were about to discover that these double entendre names were something that Virginia specialised in.

Three goldilocks and the bear were already there, as was my erstwhile hiking companion Train. All of this made for a convivial night and a reminder why I was happy to be hiking with Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt again.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: There’s a difference between facts and truth. If anyone today had asked me about the roller coaster, I could have stated, with absolute accuracy, that it had taken me three days to cover the 12-mile stretch. Omitting the bit about camping half a mile into it, hiking four miles the next day and then completing it today without difficulty is what created the gap between facts and truth. But it was fun to think about the ways one could mess with gullible and/of apprehensive nobos. After telling them that, I could have really freaked them out by saying: “And West Virginia... Man, it took me three days to cover the six miles in West Virginia...” Two neros and a zero-day trip to DC might have been a little closer to expressing the truth.","Bear's Den hostel
",Whiskey Creek shelter,"Sep 03, Sun",18.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582083,"One moment we were enjoying a quiet break at Manassas Gap shelter and the next we were surrounded by a dozen or so dogs. 
This turned out to be just another manifestation of our proximity to the DC area, where there is an organised group comprising dog owners who like to go running with their pets. They were briefly worried whether we’d be upset by this sudden profusion of canines but one look at how we were all petting their dogs quickly put them at ease.

Inevitably, that led to us chatting about our thru-hikes, leading to them in turn asking whether we needed anything. As it happened, we did – we were aiming to do a quick resupply in Front Royal before going into Shenandoah National Park but it was looking like a tough two-road hitch.

One of the dog owners was kind enough to drive us to a generic discount grocery store for our resupply and then drive us back again to the trail, even though he lived in the opposite direction. The drive made it clear that this would have been a tough route to hitch hike. 

He also proved to be an interesting guy, who’d relatively recently retired from the State Department, where he’d specialised in South America. This had required him to learn Spanish and his fluency via an initial immersion course and then several postings was such that the Spanish speakers he interacted with never picked him for a Gringo but couldn’t be sure where he was from. Mexicans, he told us with a grin, thought he was Colombian, while Colombians were convinced his accent was Mexican.

The trail was not particularly exciting in this section, but at least it wasn’t following straight, flat ridgelines as it had for most of the last 400 miles or so. Still, it was almost entirely forested and viewless, and felt like it was a connector section before reaching Shenandoah National Park tomorrow. 

As if to compensate for this, the next shelter we encountered was famous for being one of the nicest on the trail so far. Whoever is responsible for the Jim and Molly Denton shelter went way beyond the minimum and this structure was three-sided like the others but otherwise was of an entirely different kind. An expansive deck at the front featured Adirondack chairs, while there was a separate covered eating and cooking area nearby. And a game of horseshoes set up in the grassy area in front. And a spring-fed shower, which Train tried and reported back was “very very cold”. 

It was a shame that it was too early in the day for us to stop so we pushed on. The next compensating factor was the Mountain Home bed and breakfast, set up literally a stone’s throw from the AT by a couple who we were told had thru-hiked the year before.

They didn’t seem to be home but they left open the “Cabin”, a self contained building which was also an appealing place to stay. More importantly from our point of view, they had ice cream and similar luxuries available on the honesty system. And there was a swing seat looking down the valley where we could enjoy the view while eating our tubs of ice cream. WIN!

Moorenko’s was a brand I hadn’t seen before but their ginger ice cream was delicious. And, as the company slogan on the tub stated, it was “cheaper than therapy"".

We knew the final section of the day was likely to hurt, since we were climbing up into the Shenandoahs. It was indeed hard work but the trail was good and our fitness was up to the challenge.

Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt had stocked up on water at Mountain Home but Train and I were aiming to visit a spring on a 0.2 side trail from the shelter. This is another sign of the time of year but the spring was only barely flowing and was difficult to access, being little more than a puddle in a gap between excavated boulders. We obtained water, but it contained a fair bit of fibre.

Three goldilocks and the bear were already present and it took a bit of ingenuity to find campsites on the rocky and sloping ridge. As ever, we were aided by the work of those who had gone before to create camping areas. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Everyone hikes their own hike out here, as is only right since there are no real rules to an AT hike other than the ones you impose. There are, however, differing levels of purity. My only requirement was for a continuous line of footsteps from Canada to Springer, which allows for occasional blue blazes, while others want to see every single blaze. When our driver dropped us off at the highway and not the car park from which he’d originally taken us, we were faced with a quandary: is it worth doing a few hundred yards of meritless road walking? About half of us – including me – decided it was.","Whiskey Creek shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582094,"We’d been looking forward to the Shenandoah National Park for a while. After several weeks of mostly nondescript ridgelines on the AT, the prospect of more extensive views and better trail was beguiling.

But the odd aspect of today was that we were equally motivated by getting out of the Shenandoahs, because later this afternoon we were due to meet Sweetblood’s grandfather and uncle, who were hosting us at their family’s country home nearby for two zero days. 

Sweetblood had been looking forward to this for seemingly her entire hike and as today grew closer she’d been exhibiting the kind of excitement usually reserved for seven-year-olds on Christmas morning. She and Sriracha are also “big tent” people – it’s just one reason why I like hiking with them -- and demonstrated this by inviting most of the hikers in our vicinity to join the mountain house trip.

All this set up today for an unusual mix of wanting to enjoy the park while also wanting to hoof it to the rendezvous point. Originally, the meeting place was going to be Thornton Gap, requiring us to cover 25 miles and thus really having to haul ass along the trail. Wisdom prevailed and we rescheduled our meeting place to be Elk Wallow wayside.

There was still a reasonable distance to cover but we were aided by the trail improving in quality once we crossed the national park boundary after an hour or so of hiking this morning. This was in keeping with being in a national park, with its increased budgets and standards, but also at odds with the fact that the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, which had been responsible for trail maintenance since Pine Grove Furnace State Park, also did the maintenance of the AT here. 

In the earlier days of the AT, we would have covered this distance by walking on Skyline Drive, the road that was designed in the 1930s to create a car-friendly national park. Now the trail mirrors the road by going above or below it.

As soon as we first crossed Skyline Drive, we decided to do some retro-blazing by following the road because the AT went 500ft to the top of a hill then 500ft straight back down again to the road, which had contoured around. Dirt’s sense of purity had her following the real trail but the rest of us took the road and waited for her at the far end, by which time we’d reminded ourselves how much road walking sucked.

Fortunately, this was also the most egregious section in terms of pointless height gain and loss, so the benefits of road walking after that did not justify preferring it to the trail.

While we were waiting for Dirt, Train ended up coughing violently – as a result of... well, let’s just say that he takes safety meetings very seriously and holds them constantly – and there was a sudden movement in the thick shrubs to one side.  Shenandoah National Park is known as bear country and I suspect this was our first bear encounter, although we couldn’t get a definitive sighting to confirm.
Another aspect of having transitioned from summer into autumn manifested itself when springs and streams that were shown on the Guthook app as ""reliable"" (as they probably are when nobos come through here) were now no longer flowing. There was supposedly a stream on the hill Dirt climbed (she said it was dry) and I was pretty certain it ought to be flowing downstream where it crossed the road, but it too was dry.

Fortunately, we were all carrying enough water to get us to Gravel Springs shelter, our intended lunch site, despite a solid climb over an intermediate hill. At least these climbs were definitely compensated in the form of frequent views over the park.

Pan arrived just as we were about to leave and was quickly invited to join our double zero that day. We then hiked along even easier terrain to Elk Wallow wayside.

Among hikers, the waysides – informal restaurants attached to small grocery stores selling food and tourist kitsch – are a major part of the Shenandoahs’ appeal. From here on, we passed one nearly every day and I got in on the action at this one by ordering two chilli cheese dogs – ‘cos MURICA! – and a beer. I could get used to this!

An hour or so later, Sweetblood’s grandfather John and uncle Dave arrived in two cars, into which we squeezed, made the standard apologies for our rank hiker aroma and drove to Luray.

On the way we stopped at an Italian restaurant to assuage our hiker hunger – we were humbled when our hosts insisted on paying for all of us – then went to the neighbouring supermarket to stock up on beer and snacks for the next two days. 
The forecast for tomorrow is for a day of drizzle, but we’re going to be inside and doing nothing but eating and drinking. WIN!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: As we were hiking along, we met a couple coming the other way and quickly realised it was Bashful and her boyfriend Mark. She'd always told him she'd never get married so he never asked but one consequence of the months she'd spent away from him was realising that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him. So when she got off the trail in New Jersey, she went to Washington DC to meet him and bought a ring to propose. And he said yes.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582122,"It'd be wrong to say that we did nothing during our two days at Sweetblood's grandfather's sumptuous mountain house.

One activity was our continuing cultural elucidation of Dirt, whose movie knowledge reflected the narrow compass of deemed acceptability one might expect from a bible college student who came from a deeply religious family. 

This had led to constant refrains of ""What do you mean you've never seen [insert iconic movie here]"". And we're not talking about her failing to have seen movies like Debbie Does Dallas or Straw Dogs or even The Omen. Going through the collection of DVDs at the home led to Dirt admitting she'd never seen either The Princess Bride or Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

So we watched both of those. And drank beer and cider. And chatted to John and Dave. And generally chilled out. I tell you, our days were full! 

AT fact of the day: I'd been falling behind on this journal while on the trail so most of my time at the house was spent catching up. And after doing eight days of entries using the crappy swipe-typing on a dodgy five-year-old smartphone bought second hand in Jerusalem last year, something went wrong* and I lost them all, prompting me to give up on updating this journal contemporaneously, although I took notes to do now I'm off the trail.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582138,"The shadows were starting to lengthen as we approached Pinnacle Rock, but it seemed like we would still have plenty of time to get to the campground a mile or so beyond. 

But when we saw the gorgeous view from the top of the crag and realised it was going to have a grandstand view of the sunset, there was an instant vote in favour of cooking dinner here instead. 

This kind of spontaneousness is something I've always like about the hiking life, not least because it reminds us that for all the need to make miles before the onset of winter, the rules out here are what we decide them to be rather than imposed externally. 

The sunset was indeed worth waiting for, and worth hiking in the gloaming for afterwards. 

We were fortunate that all of us were carrying enough water to cope with this new development, although Train later admitted that he'd already added flavouring to his water so he had the unusual experience of blackberry-flavoured noodles. 

The day had also started with food, understandably enough, although after being fed throughout our double zero by Sweetblood's grandfather and uncle, we insisted on cooking breakfast for them today. Even then, Dave came down early to help us cook a hearty (IE: full of cholesterol and carbs) meal, after which we squeezed back into two cars and reversed our journey to Elk Wallow wayside. 

After thanking them profusely -- but, inevitably, inadequately -- for their prodigious hospitality, we headed up the trail. There seemed to be new work on some of the water bars we were encountering and this became more obvious as we hiked along, which was explained when we met a couple of trail maintainers who'd been responsible for their work. I always enjoy meeting those who help keep the trail in shape because it means we can thank them directly for their unsung work. They in turn explained that the Shenandoah's large bear population was one of the biggest challenges to keeping the trail in shape because they turn over rocks in water bars in search of bugs and worms.

Our intermediate goal was Thornton Gap, where Sweetwater was due to meet Cianna, her best friend from college, to hike with us for a few hours.

She was unfortunate to join us at the start of a steady two-mile climb up from the gap to Mary's Rock, 1100ft higher, but fortunate that the climb was on beautifully graded trail that had been created as a bridle path by a depression era work group in the 1930s. It was relatively painless and the views made the effort worthwhile, although the real icing on the metaphorical cake was running into day hikers who announced they have spare cold beers for us. 

Once we farewelled Cianna, we hiked on to Byrd's Hut and found Pan already there, along with 2am, a new college grad who I'd apparently met earlier in Vermont. He'd been hiking with a buddy from college who'd been injured and later got off trail, after which 2am went from doing 10-mile days to 30-mile days, at which point he crossed paths with us.

He and Pan were both settled in but the rest of us aimed to go further and left with an informal agreement to meet tomorrow at Skyland Wayside, which had a breakfast buffet. There was much enthusiasm for this idea.

It was a mile past there that we reached Pinnacle Rock and made our impromptu decision to enjoy a meal with a view.

That meant we were definitely pushing dusk by the time we finally reached Pinnacles picnic ground, where we found Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt set up in an idyllic grassy spot on top of a small knoll. 

It was a good site. Too good, as it turned out, because the park police came by at 11pm and informed us we weren't allowed to camp there. They were good about it -- they could have ticketed us but instead just told us to hike out of sight and reset our camp. We found a passable site a few minutes walk into the woods, where we set up again while trying not to be freaked out by the weird eye reflections from the herd of deer that were wondering what these interlopers were doing in their world. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The closest thing to a silver lining of our late night wake-up call was I'd forgotten to drink the PBR I'd been carrying all day. If not for moving the tent, it would have ended up being a breakfast beer -- which probably wouldn't have made the day end well...","Timberville

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582161,"""You're hiking the AT?"" a day hiker asked.
""Yes,"" I replied, expecting the usual questions: Are you doing the whole thing? How long will it take? Did you start in Maine? How much does your pack weigh? Do you poop in the woods? Etc etc.

But no. This was something else.

""If you're on the AT,"" he said, pointing in the direction I was about to head. ""You want to follow those white blazes on these trees.""

""Oh... Um, thanks."" I said, suppressing an urge to add: ""So that's what those white things I've been seeing since Maine are! I've been wondering.""

When the tramily gathered once more a couple of miles later, we quickly discovered that we'd all interacted in this way with this day hiker.

Sweetblood and Dirt were convinced he was mansplaining, as defined by men explaining condescendingly towards women, but Sriracha and my own experience suggested there was no gender divide involved. 

""He was dorksplaining,"" I suggested. ""He did this to everyone.""

This was a discordant moment on a day which had been shaping up as one of the best, at least based on the town-food test, because we were due to hit not just one but TWO waysides, with their restaurants and all the hiker fuel they contained.

The first, Skyland Lodge, had lived up to the billing, which is good because there needs to be a powerful incentive to see me hiking by 7.15am. Being up early and the first on the trail meant I came close to a bear encounter, finding instead a very fresh scratch mark on the trail where some hungry bruin had been hunting for bugs -- apparently until detecting my imminent arrival.

It was only 3.8 miles to Skyland Wayside, which proved to be far bigger than its Elk Wallow counterpart and spanned many accommodation blocks, an expansive store and -- thankfully -- a restaurant with a buffet breakfast. 

The waitress was a little perplexed when I rocked up solo and asked for a table for eight but I looked slightly less delusional when Pan and then 2am rocked up soon after, despite having to an extra two miles. They were clearly fast hikers. Sriracha and Train followed suit, arriving an hour before the end of the buffet but still more than capable of getting their money's worth out of it. Sweetblood and Dirt took their time and arrived shortly before we waddled out of the restaurant, our pockets stuffed with some cupcakes to share with them.

From there it was easy hiking on good trail that contoured around the hills on the opposite side to Skyline Drive rather than going over the top of every knoll on the ridgeline. Soon after we'd been dorksplained by our day hiker about the trail being marked with white blazes, we were still comparing notes when we arrived at Big Meadow wayside, which proved to be even more lavish than Skyland had been. It included an upmarket hotel as well as the usual camping and cabins. 

And, of course, a restaurant for more chilli cheese dogs and a blackberry milkshake.

The rest of the afternoon was more cruisy hiking towards Bearfence Mountain. Once again, we were pushing the available daylight to get down from the viewpoint to Bearfence shelter. And once again the prospect of another session of the sunset cooking club was more enticing. (Fortunately Train seemed to have learned his lesson from last night and had plain water rather than flavoured to cook with.) 

The sun was long gone by the time we reached the shelter. Such is the effect of our proximity to the DC area, the niceness of the Shenandoahs and being here on a weekend, it was packed with people and even all the available camping sites were taken. 

I managed to find a place to pitch my tent right next to the shelter, but even the presence of two loud and annoying people next to my tent, talking over each other about the Jersey Devil (a local equivalent of Sasquatch or the Yeti) long into the night. I was tired enough -- and still full enough from two lots of town food -- that I didn't care.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We'd only needed to carry one day of food after the mountain house sojourn because of today's pair of waysides. At Big Meadow, we only needed to stock up for one night because there's another wayside tomorrow. This, as much as the scenery, is why the Shenandoah National Park is rated so highly among AT hikers. I could get used to this.","Pinnacles picnic area

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582183,"After yesterday's indulgent double-wayside schedule, today was looking grim on the town-food front: 30 miles between opportunities to indulge in chilli cheese fries. The horror!
But when all looked lost, a solution presented itself: Train's daughter Emily was studying at James Madison University, a short drive from where the VA Route 33 crossed the AT, and she was coming to visit her dad for a couple of hours. 

And what college student doesn't want a free meal? So Train arranged to meet her at 9am and then we'd all drive up to Loft Mountain wayside to catch up over food. WIN! 

One of the common themes of my AT hike is that I hike slower than all the others around me, which is hardly surprising when they're mostly less than half my age and haven't (yet) wrecked their knees through mountaineering and adventure racing and two other thru-hikes.

A corollary theme is hating to feel anyone is waiting for me, which is why I was on the trail at a recent record of 6.45am, aiming to cover the six miles to the meeting place in time.

For all my hatred of getting up early, the calm and quiet meant there are definite benefits to hiking at this hour and I cantered along mostly easy trail to the meeting place, arriving just after 9am. None of the other faster members of the tramily had caught me, which was quietly satisfying even if my goal was simply not to be the last.

The true reason for this became apparent when the others rocked up over the next hour: Train's daughter hadn't got his messages about the meeting place until this morning and was running late. 

Once everyone was together we hiked another three miles or so to Swift Run Gap, with Train taking a cross country route down to Skyline Drive to meet Emily, who was at overlook nearby. We all reconvened at the gap, after which Emily was kind enough to drive us to Loft Mountain wayside where we sated all our desires for carbohydrates and cholesterol. She seemed nice, although she didn't seem to quite get why her dad wanted to hike the AT as the fulfillment of a dream he'd had since he was a 12-year-old scout and met an AT thru hiker.

She dropped us all back at the gap, at which point Train went to pay for her to fill the tank with gas and the rest of us resumed our hike. From the gap, we worked off some of our wayside food by hauling ass up the steady climb to the summit of High Top Mountain. From that point, the trail undulated along the ridgeline while Skyline Drive snaked around below. 

We arrived at Pinefield Shelter to find a group of section hikers present, who I suspect were mentally scarred by learning that we'd covered four times as many miles as they had, despite our taking a two hour lunch break at the Wayside and carrying beers with us.

But they were a fun bunch and we swapped stories into the evening.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The reliability of water continues to confound. There was a spring marked near the summit of High Top Mountain which I assumed would have no chance of flowing, based on how few of the water sources listed on the Guthook app had been running. And of course it was flowing well -- probably because we carried a full load of water up the mountain.","Bearfence Mountain shelter

The section hikers with whom we'd shared the shelter looked traumatised by this exclamation. We'd shocked them the previous evening when they asked how far we'd come that day and discovered it was rather more than their six miles. Now we were going to do more than four times as far and we seemed like we're looking forward to it.

And we are. On the PCT and the CDT, I'd done marathon days within a month or so of starting the trail, as fitness kicked in, and often did a series of 30+ mile days. But like in everything else about the AT, this trail has been different and the biggest day so far -- in the rolling farmland of the Cumberland valley -- still fell short of the 26.2 miles of the regulation marathon.

But the stars aligned to make that our goal today, thanks to an appropriately sited shelter, the easier trails of Shenandoah National Park and a 13-mile dry stretch that made stopping short more problematic than continuing.

Not all the stars aligned, however. Last night, Sweetblood had come in limping a little from sore knees and shin splints and was worried about pushing the miles today so she diverted from the trail and came with me to the Loft Mountain wayside. For me, it was another chance to stock up on the stodgy town food that helps me hike and I was going to meet the others at the Loft Mountain store, near the camping area at the top of the hill. For Sweetblood, she took the pragmatic decision to hike the road rather than risk aggravating her niggling pains on the more strenuous trail. I wished her well and arranged to meet her halfway through the day.

The others were a little saddened to hear of Sweetblood's decision but were also supportive.

As we headed along the trail, I encountered a couple of hikers coming the other way and saw one had a PCT class bandana from 2016. Lobby -- short for Immortal Lobster, which was an epic trail name that had an equally epic origin story -- had indeed thru-hiked the PCT last year and now was section hiking with her friend, Trinket. It was particularly awesome to meet someone else who understood what the PCT is like and that not all trails are like the AT. It was like a secret bond, and I ended up chatting with them for close to half an hour.

Even after all this time, there were still a handful of nobos coming through, although all of these now accepted they will have to flip up to Maine. Soon after my interaction with Lobby and Trinket, I saw someone of clear thru-hiker demeanour walking towards me.

Bookworm had started on May 16 and had managed to hike fewer than 800 miles in a little under five months, which worked out as a very impressive 7.4 miles per day. There's nothing wrong with a leisurely pace, which probably increased the enjoyment factor, but he was adamant he'd be able to get through Pennsylvania before flipping from Delaware Water Gap. As before in similar circumstances, I tried to maintain a neutral expression and just said: ""Well, good luck.""

The tramily met up for lunch at Black Rock shelter, which was our last water for 13 miles and roughly the halfway point for the day. 

Half a marathon left? No problem! And it really was pretty painless, although I adopted my usual caboose position, trailing well behind the others.

I thought that this would mean no chance of seeing any bears, for which the Shenandoahs are famously replete, but I ended up seeing two within five minutes. 

The first was when I was walking about 200m behind Train. A truly enormous bear didn't react as Train went past but then bolted into the forest when I went past a few minutes later, which is the only way each of us realised it was there. I must be a noisy hiker. Or I'm scarier than Train?

Train was a little miffed at missing the bear but then when I hiked on ahead of him, I'd barely gone a few hundred metres before another crashing sound in the undergrowth showed there'd been another bear in my vicinity. It was a yearling and was running full pelt into the forest. This time Train was really miffed because he'd missed this one too, so I suggested he hike ahead in case there was a third bear. 

There wasn't, of course, and instead we completed the final few miles to the shelter, which we reached just as the day transitioned into dusk. I was very glad to see the spring flowing just before reaching the shelter since we were relying on it.

There was definitely a buzz among our group for taking on and achieving a task like our marathon day. It was nice to be able to bask in the glow of the experience, even if it sounded paltry by PCT and CDT standards. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Dirt's walking stick is one she's carried since Vermont, adding a ribbon for each state she completes. It even has ""Dirt"" enscribed into the side. It'd done nearly 1000 miles, but suddenly broke today out of the blue.","Pinefield shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582224,"Of all the scenarios for how today was likely to end, it's fair to say I did not rate highly the prospect of Dirt and Sweetblood getting spontaneous tattoos on a kitchen table from a guy they'd met a couple of hours before. 
But that unpredictability is just one reason why I really like trail life. 

Sitting around in an anarchic share house in Charlottesville was the polar opposite to how the day began, in a shelter in the woods. 

Considering yesterday's literal and figurative marathon, we all bore up remarkably well physically and could have done a normal day of hiking but we were grateful instead to do be doing a short day to Rockfish Gap, the end of the Shenandoahs.

A series of other factors prompted this. One was the warning we'd been repeatedly given about potential torrential downpours as the remnants of Hurricane Irma reached us. Another was the presence in nearby Charlottesville of Pepa, an AT and PCT alumni who'd helped at Scout and Frodo's with me for several weeks as we ministered to this year's PCTers. And, because we're hikers, there was also the existence of a famous-on-the-AT all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet for $11 in Waynesboro. 

There was not much to say about the 7.9 mile section of trail to Rockfish Gap. It was pretty fast and despite a few minutes of rain at the start that prompted me to use for the first time the umbrella I'd been carrying since Harpers Ferry, it was mostly dry.

Needless to say, our top priority was the Chinese buffet and we took advantage of the list of trail angels offering to give lifts into town. 

The restaurant staff were obviously used to hikers and showed us where to stow our packs well away from where their aroma could affect any real paying customers then ushered us to the buffet. Maybe my standards tend to veer towards quantity over quality but the buffet was the business and we went back for plate after plate. And how many Chinese buffets feature mac and cheese?

We were sitting around digesting when Pepa and a friend, Carly, turned up to collect us in two cars. It was a generous effort, given that a few days before I asked if the tramily could come and crash at his house. 

It all worked out awesomely, Pepa's two flatties were kind enough to welcome us in then he shuttled us to and from the supermarket to resupply. Then he went to his cafe to grab the leftovers from the bakery section and brought them back. As befits someone who'd hiked 7000+ miles, he understood hiker trash and our needs.

The evening might have been complete through watching another movie designed to educate Dirt's gaps in her iconic movie history, with in this case a screening of Pulp Fiction. but then Pepa's flatmate was talking about having a tattoo gun as his hobby. The next thing I knew, Dirt and Sweetblood were getting tattoos behind their right ears.

It was the perfect random moment to end a classic AT day.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The Chinese restaurant included fortune cookies and some of ours were spot on. Dirt's said: ""Depart not from the path which fate has you assigned."" Mine was also on point: ""You are one of the people who 'goes places in life'."" No mention of the 3mph bit, though...","Calf Mountain shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582258,"""Hey, Rolling Thunder,"" Train whispered conspiratorially, then beckoned me to one side before pulling out a pair of coconut halves. ""What do you think?""
It'd been a few weeks since the tramily had watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a recurring motif of which had been King Arthur and his crew simulating horseback travel by having their vassals clop coconut halves.

Now we were an hour or two into the Blue Ridge mountains on a grey and misty day and Train revealed that he'd secretly bought a coconut at the supermarket in Charlottesville the day before and then borrowed a saw from Pepa to cut it into halves.

""You've got the perfect accent to announce it as we walk into Wolf Shelter,"" he added.

And a few minutes later we did just that. Sriracha, Sweetblood, Dirt and 2am went through the same process I'd just done: disbelief at what they were seeing, then puzzlement and finally laughter.

This was then followed by an instant agreement that we definitely had to carry the coconut halves all the way to Springer and Sweetblood announced that from this moment, our tramily would be known as the Knights of the Round Table.

Team KRT, as we became known, was born. Or at least named.

Pepa and his flatmate Keith had been kind enough to drive us back to the trail that morning, where the mountains remained shrouded in grey clouds. This was a far cry from the dire warnings of torrential downpours caused by the tail end of Hurricane Irma. I'd slept out on the porch, where the worst the weather threw at us was a steady light drizzle.

We knew the forecast was for it to clear up during the day, which it did by the time we'd completed the steady 2000ft climb from the shelter to the top of Hunchback mountain, which was on the ridge of the Blue Ridge Parkway -- the biggest climb we'd done for more than a month.

The parkway was a little bit like a low-rent version of Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park and, like Skyline Drive, the trail and the road intertwined along the top of the crest of the ridge.

Once on the ridgetop, the hiking was unremarkable and with few views. For the final few miles, we traversed on the same side of the ridge as the road but below it before emerging where another road crossed the ridge at Wintergreen ski resort.

I emerged onto the pass just as a car stopped to give Sweetblood, Sriracha and 2am a lift down towards Devil's Backbone Brewery in the valley below. 

There was room for me but I decided instead that I'd better wait for Dirt and Train, just in case they weren't sure knew which way to hitch off the ridge to get to the brewery. They arrived about 15 minutes later and the first car to go past -- a summer worker at Wintergreen skifield -- stopped to pick us up. He was clearly used to hikers and took us straight to the brewery.

Devils Backbone had quite a reputation on the AT and at least one member of each party of nobos we'd met seemed to have been wearing some kind of Devils Backbone merchandise. We'd heard plenty of stories about how awesome and hiker friendly the place was, even though its indie-brewery cred had been diminished by selling out to the Anheuser-Busch corporarate conglomerate that owns brands like Budweiser.

Thru hikers tend to stand out and we were greeted as such immediately by a greeter, who advised us genially but firmly to pitch our tents and then come back for some hospitality. I suspect this was a prudent suggestion born of having to deal with too many hikers who went drinking and then tried to pitch their tents or possibly even find the camping area. 

Soon enough we were back at the bar, where we settled in for a meal. The greeter said some other hikers had arrived she automatically assumed they'd join us, which was fine by us since the ""big tent"" is one of the hiking community's default positions that I enthusiastically endorse.

The new arrivals turned out to be people I hadn't met before -- an Ohio flipper called OK and a Maryland sobo called Happy Feet -- but who were to become constant companions in the next two months. They fitted right in and we had a convivial night before wandering back over to the campsite.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: A middle-aged couple I passed on the trail had a suspicously familiar accent and proved to be Kiwis who split their time between Waiheke Island, off Auckland, and the US. I had a sneaking suspicion they were once in the diplomatic service and thus we were likely to have some mutual friends but I greeted them, as I do any Kiwis, with my basic Maori: ""Kia ora, kapai?"" (""How are you? Good?"") Alas my bluff was called when they responded in fluent te reo and I had to admit that I spoke Maori like a Pakeha tamaiti from Te Whenua o Te Potiki-Tautahi (White boy from Christchurch)...","Charlottesville

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582290,"Pain now? Or pain later?

On the ascent of the Priest, a peak famous on the AT for involving a brutal 3000ft climb over 3.5 miles, the question wasn't quite as simple as that because pain was inevitable. Instead the options were more pain now (by camelling up for water early on in the ascent for tonight's camp on the summit) or more pain later (by having to hike on to the shelter to get water then walk back to camp).

I opted, as I usually do, for pain now and filled up with three litres of water from the creek the trail crossed about 900ft into the 3000ft climb. I didn't need familiarity with the metric system to work out that three litres of water meant three kilograms of weight.

The others opted for pain later and went ahead. That didn't make much difference because I'd inevitably have fallen behind anyway and instead I plugged away up the hill. I was grateful that, unlike Maine, the trail was actually pretty good and it was easy to slowly grind my way upwards.

We'd already done one big climb that day, up to Three Ridges, but through a spectacular bit of dumbassery, I'd managed to add an even earlier one to that right after leaving Devil's Backbone brewery.

We'd wandered over to the restaurant for the hiker breakfast, which cost $5 for an impressive concoction described as ""whatever the cook decided to make"". In today's instance, it was a mix of eggs, vegetables and fruit.

There was reputedly a free shuttle back up to the trail at 9am but at 8.40am, I wandered out to hitch up to free up space for the others. One car offered a ride to Wintergreen Resort, which I declined because the turnoff was well before the place we'd hitched down from the previous evening, Then another car said they were going up to the pass and I accepted a ride.

By ""the pass"", I soon discovered the driver actually meant Wintergreen Resort, with the result that I had to hike about 300m of ""bonus"" ascent over more than half a mile to reach the place where I could abide by my goal of contiguous footsteps. My worst case scenario -- of being passed by the rest of the tramily being transported by the brewery shuttle -- was averted by a few minutes by my hauling ass up the road.

Once we were all back together again, we followed the trail over a small hillock and towards the ascent of Three Ridges, about which we'd been hearing dire warnings for months from nobos. The climb was fine and the warnings proved to be yet more nobo hype.

In the midst of this we met another couple of straggler nobos. Broken Arrow was a 70-year-old woman who has been out since February and seemed to be loving her hiking life. Later we encountered Superdave, a professional gambler who had been out since June 22 after winning enough at poker to be able to hike. Neither aimed to flip or complete their thru hike but were instead just seeing how far they could go.

After the top of Three Ridges, we were warned -- by nobos, so not entirely trustworthy, but warned nonetheless -- that the descent would be worse than the subsequent ascent of The Priest. So it proved and I at least was grateful we weren't coming up this way.

We regathered at Harpers Creek shelter, where we encountered Footprint, Happy Feet and OK and tried to entice them to camp on the summit with us instead of at the shelter a little further on. 

Once we crossed the river and then a road, the ascent of The Priest began. Despite adding a bonus 3kg part of the way up, it was actually OK and I slowly plugged my way up to the top, dead last but arriving in camp faster than those who had to hike on the third of the mile to get water from a spring near the shelter.

The campsite was next to rock ledges that had spectacular views for the sunset and seemed likely to have an equally awesome view of the sunrise too. Footprint and Pan joined us as we cooked on the ledges and enjoyed the sweeping views, feeling like the richest people in the world. And we are, in the things that matter.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Around 1300 miles into this trip, we ought to have some hiker cred. But we managed to be 180 degrees wrong in our prediction of where the sun was going to set -- a mistake that only became apparent when the sun burst through the cloud cover... D'oh!","Devil's Backbone brewery

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582325,"""Attending bible college has made me acutely aware of all the sins I've committed on trail. I've decided to enumerate the top three: 

* I confess that when I saw Sriracha and Sweetblood, I thought they were section hikers

* I confess that I told EVERYONE on trail that Rolling Thunder snores. Really loud.

* I confess that on one occasion I made a 'Human Centipede' reference to our massage train. Disclaimer: I was very drunk that night. I guess I ought to confess that too.""

Anonymously confessing one's trail sins in the log book at The Priest shelter is one of the most venerable of the many traditions on the AT. Seeing just what was written in it was one of the main motivators for getting going this morning and we sat around at the shelter, vacillating between amazement, revulsion, disbelief and a range of other feelings at what was written within.

""Professor Sprout and I have behaved quite inappropriately within earshot of others, at first delusionally thinking we were being discreet but then quite a bit since realising otherwise.""

""I have sinned. I washed my lady parts in a small spring in Pennsylvania -- and it wasn't a piped spring.""

""People ask us if we're married. We are -- just not to each other. Everyone involved is OK with it.""

""Forgive me father for I have sinned. I woke up one night and needed to pee but couldn't find my sandals and took GG's -- and accidentally peed on them. I've never told her.""

And so on. Switchback managed to get FIVE separate mentions from those who admitted having impure thoughts spurred by his thighs.

All this left us squirming and laughing in equal measure, and variations on what we'd read -- including working out the identities of those who'd attempted to remain anonymous -- fuelled our conversations for the rest of the day.

It helped the miles cruise by, which was helpful because the terrain was -- thankfully -- kinder than the previous day but also less memorable, involving for the most part a series of traverses through viewless forest. 

Progress was affected -- at first negatively but then positively -- by two factors. One was when the trail went past what was clearly once a hilltop farm that had since been entirely reclaimed by nature, with only the existence of an old apple tree absolutely covered in fruit showing people had once lived here.

This had a particularly acute effect on Dirt, who scoured the apples and gathered up the best. Some were immediately eaten and more than half a dozen others were carried for later.

At a shelter soon after, we were gently teasing her for having collected seven apples, which she'd placed in front of her on the shelter's picnic table. While she was looking away, I snuck an apple out of my pocket and put it with hers and then, when she looked back, asked: ""I thought you said you had seven apples? You must have grabbed eight.""

She stared at the line of apples with a ruffled brow and was clearly thinking ""Did I grab eight?"" This might have bugged her for days if not for another moment of distraction, at which point some of the others added another two apples to her stash.

This time she realised what was going on. Two middle fingers were raised, followed by a ""F*ck you guys!"" There was a smile in her voice, though, so we hadn't offended her too deeply. We hope.

Also during this break, someone passed on the snippet of information that Buena Vista had a farmers market on Saturdays. Farmers markets, we quickly discovered, are to Dirt what catnip is to felines. ""We have to go there.""

Buena Vista was a feasible distance and there was a campground in town. I'm always down for a town visit, because it means town food. 

Whether we were motivated by fresh fruit or stodgy diner food, the positive draw of this on our hiking pace more than compensated for any time lost at the apple tree. After crossing what seemed to be one of the first of the balds -- treeless areas on tops of hills -- for which the southern AT is renown, we descended 2000ft to the highway.

I arrived last, half an hour before dark, to find the others trying to hitch into town. It was a slightly tough place, right on the crest of the hill, and made more difficult by there being six of us. Even with Dirt and Sweetblood acting as ""ride brides"", with the rest of us off to one side, the passing cars were showing us no love. 

But the established hiking culture on the AT meant there are shuttle drivers on call and after ringing around a few, we arranged a lift to town for a remarkably modest sum. An ordinary family sedan duly arrived and somewhat improbably, we managed to fit the six of us along with the driver for the nine mile drive into town. 

Sweetblood and Sriracha shared the front seat, which was a slightly scary because our young driver showed a penchant for speed that was at odds with the combination of the winding road and the laws of physics. His habit of starting every sentence with ""Incidentally"" also did little to instil confidence, but he was likeable enough and we arrived at the campground safely.

A final surprise for the day was finding an ice cream shop next to the campground. And then finding that the owner, a former journalism lecturer, gave every AT hiker a free ice cream.

Need I say it? Life is good.

AT fact of the day: My own confessions? I could have filled an entire page. Forgive me trail gods, for I have:

* relentlessly slagged off the AT as not nearly as nice as the PCT and CDT*;

* suggested that the reason for The Priest's name is that it leaves you feeling sodomised; 

* on wet nights have sometimes slept in shelters even though I know I snore**;
* once went four states (Great Barrington, MA, to High Point, NJ) between washing my clothes**; and 

* once joked that the unseen occupant of an unfamiliar tent at a recent shelter might be [notorious pink blazer] wearing a skin suit created from [notorious pink blazee].

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582360,"What thru-hiker doesn't need a rock?

Clearly I do, because I've just carried one for more than 20 miles. 

The genesis of this began when we were hitching out of Buena Vista after a morning of mixed fortunes. It was a success for me, who found a classic US diner and was now on the verge of a cholesterol coma, but it was bitter disappointment for Dirt, who discovered the farmers market that had enticed us into town no longer existed and instead her breakfast came from a Dollar General, eaten hiker-trash style on the pavement outside.

Dirt, 2am and I stuck our thumbs out on the outskirts of town and we were duly collected by a family in a small jeep who offered us space in their trailer, sitting on some roofing iron. It was an entertaining ride, not least when a police car came the other way, but we made it to the pass without incident.

We were in the process of thanking our benefactors when the mother stepped forward with their young son and said: ""Grayson has something he wants to give you."" Grayson duly handed over a painted rock with ""PEACE"" on it. 

""Thank you,"" I replied, because clearly my thru hike would be incomplete without a rock. I am, admitted, not the most ultralight hiker out here but I generally draw the line at carrying rocks, even painted ones with peace messaging.

Others might have taken the rock and then surreptitiously dumped it down the trail but in a moment of soppiness, I put it in my pack and started thinking about how cool it'd be if a relay of us could take Grayson's rock all the way to Springer. So I grabbed the family's phone number and promised to provide updates on the rock's progress.

It helped that the trail was downhill for most of the first couple of hours so the extra weight didn't manifest itself as it might have if we'd been facing a brutal ascent. 

The downhill route was because, for reasons that were not immediately obvious, the trail went downstream of a dam before heading regaining the ridge on the far side. The upside of this was it took us past Brown Mountain, an old farming settlement of a kind that was once commonplace in the Appalachians but which had long since been abandoned and reclaimed by nature. A historic interpretive sign talked about how they grew corn here in the narrow valley, which seemed nearly impossible to conceive, but there was no question in conceptualising just how desperately insecure life must have been here. 

The knee issues that had seen me using 800mg of ibruprofen a day back up in Maine and New Hampsire had been brought under control to the point that I hadn't used any Vitamin I since Vermont and I'd even stopped using my hiking poles in recent weeks. Sriracha had started having knee problems, however, and gratefully accepted the offer of borrowing my poles until they came right, which meant my pack was actually probably lighter even with Grayson's rock. 

The ascent on the far side of the dam was steep but steady and we reunited at a spring near the top of the ridge. As was becoming a trend in the last few weeks, water was becoming more marginal and although there was a pooling spring, it required a scoop to access. We were very happy to see it flowing because this was the last reported water for 14 miles.

The steep grades continued even after we regained the ridgeline but motivation for onward progress came from a desire to get to the road to make it into another town, Glasgow. Despite our deflating experience with the lack of the farmers market in Buena Vista, we'd heard from reliable sources that Glasgow has a dinosaur. A DINOSAUR! 
It also featured a free shelter in town for AT hikers, as well as a new hiker hostel called Stanimals and a kick-ass diner. But I think we were all agreed that the main draw was the fibreglass dinosaur statue in the middle of town. The Awol guide even had a dinosaur symbol when it listed Glasgow's amenities, as it should.
Because we were likely to be chasing dusk again, as we had the evening before, we decided to call ahead and arrange another shuttle. The driver was waiting for us as we stepped onto the highway at 7.30pm and soon after, we were at the shelter in the middle of town.

There was a real sobo bubble present: September, Footprint, Happy Feet, OK and a bunch of people we'd been seeing in registers, such as Backwoods Barbie and Backwoods Ken. There were also others such as Simpleton Extraordinaire, a teacher from Vermont who was flipping around the trail with his dog, Jamieson, for 80 days. It was a cool group and the shelter -- an Eagle Scout's community service project -- was plush, with power sockets, a fire ring and even hot showers. All for free. And, of course, there was the dinosaur.

Soon we had beer and calzones and were sitting around the fire, catching up with those we hadn't seen for a while and finding more about those who were new to us. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Train's off the trail. We're all accustomed to the high drop-out rate on the AT, where only a small fraction will finish, but we didn't expect anyone to drop out after the halfway mark and with mostly easy country between here and Springer. And we especially didn't expect it to be a member of our tramily. But he asked for a four-month break from work to do the AT but realised he wasn't going to be able to make it in time so he's getting off now to give him a couple of weeks to adjust back to real life again before resuming work. He's already talking about hiking the whole thing next year. We understand the decision but it's sad to lose a tramily member.","Buena Vista
",Glasgow,"Sep 16, Sat",21.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582397,"The sobo bubble reluctantly left Glasgow around lunchtime, but only after running out of excuses to depart.

First of all, it took a while before everyone finally emerged from either the shelter or their tents. And then Simpleton Extraordinaire made a sumptuous cooked breakfast for everyone. And then we resupplied at the small but hiker-friendly grocery store in town and finally of course we needed to have the official Sobo Bubble photo at the dinosaur statue.

Part of our reluctance to depart might not have been to do with Glasgow, although the town's dinosaur had an undeniable draw. Another factor might have been the solid 2,500ft climb we faced to regain the ridgetop.

We paid to be shuttled back to the trail, gratefully avoiding the hassle of the one-mile walk to the junction with the road from which we'd have to hitch back to where we'd been picked up last night. We then crossed the James River via an old railway bridge that was reputed to be the AT's longest footbridge and then had a mile along the riverbank before finally following a stream up to a shelter, from which the climbing began. 

I was going to leave Grayson's rock here and had prepared a note explaining its significance and including Grayson's phone number so future carriers could carry the rock forward and update Grayson's family on its progress. But as I was doing this, Simpleton said he'd take it the next leg and put it into Jamieson's pack. The rock heads south!

The only down side of our late departure was that we started our ascent in the heat of the day and it took a while to gain enough height for the heat to moderate. I was glad to be doing this in mid-September rather than in the middle of summer.

Thankfully the climb was in four separate stages, with time to recover in between as it traversed around the side of hills in between going straight up them. The climb was not too much short of what we'd done on the Priest but this was definitely easier, thanks to being broken into sections. The trail quality was good too, which made it easier to maintain a rhythm and thus easier to hike.

I went into slow-and-steady mode and rocked up to camp after everyone else. Once again, we were grateful the pooling spring was flowing because this was the last water for about 14 miles. A potential spring noted by Guthook about two thirds of a mile earlier had been flowing so slowly as to be only worthwhile in desperate circumstances.

Soon we were sitting around a fire, cooking dinner and continuing the discursive conversations that had made our stay in Glasgow so enjoyable. And tomorrow we only have a few hundred more metres of ascent to get to the top of the ridge, which ought to make tomorrow easier.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Early on in the ascent of the hills today we passed the point where a LASHer*, Mountain Man, fell from the trail and died a few days earlier. We're not entirely sure where he fell but there was a point where the trail had a steep dropoff, but it's hard to say exactly what happened and whether it was a fall or maybe a heart attack or something like that. But it's a reminder to us all to value the time we have.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583016,"Thru-hiking is not supposed to be terribly complex: you eat when you're hungry, drink when you're thirsty, hike until you're tired and camp where there's water. The simplicity of life out here is part of the appeal.

But the fact we're camping tonight in the middle of a 10-mile dry stretch shows there are exceptions to this rule. 

There's one word that explains this: Bojangles.

I hadn't heard of this southern restaurant chain but the starry-eyed expressions that North Carolina natives Sriracha and Sweetblood adopt at any mention of the name suggests this local franchise is something special. Seriously, Pavlov could have elicited a greater salivatory response using the name of this restaurant than he ever did with his bell.

All this is in keeping with the aphorism that the landmarks on the first half of any thru-hike tend to be geographical -- lakes, mountains etc -- but on the second half they tend to revolve around food. 

Looking ahead, we realised we were about 45 miles out from this beacon of southern cuisine, which meant two roughly 20-mile days and then a five-mile cruise into Daleville, home of the northernmost Bojangles on the Appalachian Trail.

And what that meant for us today was stopping in the middle of a long dry section, requiring us to camel up with several kilograms of water to haul up the hill to one of the few shelters on the trail that doesn't have a water source attached to it.

It didn't help that we adopted our usual Team KRT stance by hiking slowly in the morning, with lots of long breaks, and then hauling ass in the afternoon at a time we should have been having more frequent breaks and when we'd certainly appreciate them more. 

Part of this is because most of the tramily members are, like me, definitely not morning people. Sriracha and Sweetblood didn't manage to leave camp today until 8.20am.

And, to be fair, there was an exogenous reason why progress was halted within a few miles today -- we ran into a military guy living in DC who was hiking for a few days and insisted on plying us with freshly brewed coffee at a lookout.

Even before that, I was halted by the enticing and deeply photogenic scene of the sun streaming through the last bit of cloud enveloping the hills.

Then the trail emerged from the trees to excellent views at Apple Orchard Mountain. Given our plundering of apple trees at abandoned farms in the previous few days, we expected more of the same on this mountain but nominative determinism failed to affect reality and this was a hilltop distinctly devoid of fruit.

It was at this point, having covered just five miles by midday and realising that we needed to do nearly three times as far in the afternoon to put us in position to get our intended mileage to set us up for Bojangles.

The second half of the day was a more perfunctory affair compared to the indulgent laziness of the first part. With the hoary breath of a deadline at our necks, we hauled ass to Thunder Hill shelter for lunch. We discovered this was only 0.2 miles off the Blue Ridge Parkway, which explained a clearly non-hiking couple who were present. They were nice enough though, and particularly when they shared the rest of their lunch with us. 

Then it was time for ass-hauling mode, leading to a creek where we filtered water to take up to the dry shelter above. I vacillated about whether to camp next to this water and catch up with the others tomorrow and farewelled the others but then the business of the road and the placement of the campsites right next to it made me change my mind. I camelled up then camped halfway to the shelter. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Today we hit the northern extent of Bob Peoples -- a legendary AT figure -- graffiti, with a shelter saying that ""When Bob Peoples drives a car off the lot, it increases in value"".","Harrison Ground spring
",Buchanan Trail junction,"Sep 18, Mon",18.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583046,"We had plans today to do the miles more sensibly and less ass-backwards than yesterday, when we adopted a slower pace and more breaks in the morning then had to haul ass in the afternoon.
We even discussed a strategy: we'd do 11 miles before lunch and then, six miles later, we'd have a break just before the start of the big-ass hill to get to the shelter.

And then we hit the hawking crag and all these carefully crafted plans turned to dust.

In truth, we were OK with this. Plans, after all, are just a means to have fun out here and ought not be considered as if they are carved in stone when the reality underpinning them changes.

In this case, the trail emerged onto the Blue Ridge Parkway at an overlook that was crammed with cars and people. We quickly learned that this was a famous hawk observation area and we met Alan, a guy who stood astride both the twitching and hiking worlds by offering cold sodas and snacks to every hiker and birder who came by. 

It was also a pretty idyllic site in which we could kick off our shoes then lounge around on the grass while basking in the sun. And did someone say free food?

Soon enough, a few other birders came by, wanting to hear about our hikes and also to offer us spare cookies. 

They told us (let's just say the conversations were pretty one-sided since our mouths were full!) that this was a particularly famous site for spotting birds of prey and September was the best month to be present. In one previous year, 8000 hawks had come past in one day, including 3500 in a single hour.

Today was rather quieter than that -- maybe 20 went past during the hour we spent there -- but we tried to imagine how it must have been on that day. (It helped, of course, that imagining is another thing you can do while eating yogied cookies!)

It was nice to be back hiking with the others after camping on my own last night at a site which proved to be the most ant-populated bit of the Appalachians so far.
This was only about a mile and a half from the shelter the others stayed at and, with an early start, I arrived just as Dirt, 2am and Simpleton Extraordinaire were setting off. I caught up with the events since we'd parted, which was more entertaining than expected because Jameson, Simpleton's dog, chased away what they were pretty sure was a bear in the middle of the night.
About three and a half miles later, we caught up with the others at a pooling spring near a road crossing. I was grateful it was flowing -- although less grateful that Jameson decided to sit in the spring before I could get water from it -- because it was listed as intermittent and the next certain water was 10 miles away. Half a dozen miles later, we encountered the hawking crag and our plans changed.

All this left us a little way behind our intended schedule but the PCT-like grades that followed meant it was easy and fast hiking down to the creek which was the last source of water before our 900ft ascent of Fullhardt Knob shelter. 

Like last night, this shelter has no water source -- it featured a water tank supposedly filled from the roof but Young Scout had given us the important beta that it was empty -- and we were headed to it purely because it means we can have breakfast in Bojangles the next day. For all the extra effort we're going through, Bojangles has a lot of living up to do!

Like yesterday, the others used this final water source to cook dinner, since it would save having to carry cooking water up the mountain. 

Ever since the PCT 11 years ago, I'd watched jealously as people would cook and then hike on another couple of hours, which was also a bear-smart thing to do because it meant there weren't cooking smells around the campsite to attract pesky bruins.

But, also like yesterday, I sat around watching them cook rather than participating. I'd tried several times on the PCT and since to eat a big meal and then hike and it just doesn't work with my particular physiology. Since there are so many other factors -- a general imperviousness to injury (touch wood), a capacity for endurance and a poor sense of smell -- for which I had been blessed with a natural capability for thru-hiking, it seemed churlish to complain about something as minor as not being able to hike on a full stomach.

This final break also provided a hint at how this epic hike actually has an end point in sight -- just. 
I'm due to get my next pair of shoes in two days time, having last changed them about 750 miles ago in Connecticut, and this pair is likely to last me all the way to the end at Springer mountain. The new shoes are certainly overdue, as shown when I slipped on my way down to the creek and grazed my shin because the tread is far less grippy than they need to be. 
And as we chatted at the creek while the others cooked dinner, I also announced that I was hoping to hike with them for the rest of the way. Sweetblood, Sriracha and Dirt were also starting to make final plans for the trail. It wasn't that long ago that reaching Springer was an impossibly distant theory but they'd worked out that if we average 17-mile days until Damascus -- Dirt's home town -- we would then be able to average 12 miles a day and still finish the AT a week before Thanksgiving. 
The end is becoming visible, and the plan to slow down to enjoy the final weeks rather than treating it like an ordeal to get over with as soon as possible is just a reaffirmation that I'm hiking with like minded people.
The final haul up to Fullhardt Shelter -- the shelter sign was, of course, defaced in exactly the way you would expect -- was not too bad, being a steady ascent that was mostly on old forestry roads.

Now we're exactly five miles away from Bojangles.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The hut registers have been providing entertaining reading and one sobo ahead of us, Cauldron, had proved to be a consistently amusing scribe. At the waterless shelter I passed this morning, he wrote: ""Dear ATC, I was advised that this shelter was dry but it rained all night. Please explain.""","Buchanan Trail junction
",Fullhardt Knob shelter,"Sep 19, Tue",21.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583070,"I don't need to know what Christmas morning is like in Sweetblood's home now because I've seen how she reacts to the prospect of breakfast at Bojangles.

As this journal has often recorded, she and Sriracha are not normally morning people and regularly emerge from their tent long after the rest of the tramily have got out of theirs.

And today? She was ready to go an hour before dawn. Before dawn!

Sriracha was up too and his verdict was telling: ""I can't even imagine what it'd be like if she was on crack.""

We set off just before 7am, just as the first rays of light were coming through the trees. This was deeply aberrant behaviour for Team KRT. 

Since we were on top of a mountain, the way was fast and downhill for nearly the whole way to Daleville, although in reality no uphill could have inhibited Sweetblood's determined pace.

As it happened, we quickly discovered an extra incentive to move quickly: a jellowjacket ground nest right on the trail. Although I was -- inevitably -- near the back, I somehow managed to avoid getting stung by the aggravated swarm but nearly all the others were, suddenly finding their walking paces suddenly transformed to full-tilt running to get out of range of these angry wasps. 

Later on, we heard that 2am had it worst, since the first sting prompted him to drop his hiking pole, which rolled down the hill. While getting it, he was stung half a dozen more times before being able to run off.

From the forest, the trail went into a more farmland environment and finally into the urban one of Daleville, on the edge of which was a shopping plaza featuring Bojangles. The familiar packs of Sweetblood and Sriracha could be seen sitting outside it.

Soon I was sitting down next to Sweetblood and Sriracha, who coached me to order cajun chicken and biscuits, washed down with half a gallon of iced tea. I was particularly impressed that the menu board actually included ""fixin's"" -- what are known as sides elsewhere -- complete with the missing G. And it was good, although I'm not sure it quite lived up to the billing. Given the expectations raised over the past few days, I'm not sure anything could have.

About 20 trail miles ahead is one of the most famous sights on the AT: McAfee's Knob, featuring a particularly photogenic cliff. But how to tackle the distance between here and there saw a fracturing of Team KRT after Bojangles. 

The others were aiming to hike to the knob and camp on top for the sunset and sunrise. Since it was from there fewer than 10 miles to where we were due to meet Dirt's grandfather, aunt and uncle, who were going to take us to their home in Roanoke overnight, we had the prospect of an on-trail nero on the knob. 

Unfortunately, Jameson, Simpleton Extraordinaire's dog, had been limping for the past couple of days and was favouring one paw before he even got going this morning, prompting Simpleton to find a vet to see how serious the problem is. As it happened, there was one across the road from Bojangles. While we were still at breakfast, Simpleton announced that he was going to have a short day and Uber up to a road crossing a few miles from McAfee's Knob and meet the others there, offering to bring up supplies of booze to make for a more convivial evening. Sweetblood found appeal in this prospect and decided to join him.

The others opted to hike another 20 miles but that seemed too ambitious at my pedestrian pace, so I arranged to spend longer in Daleville and then just hike up to the next shelter, just under 10 miles away. I'd have two days of more even mileage and meet the others tomorrow as they enjoyed their nero on McAfee Knob. 

This also allowed me to hit up the outfitter in the shopping plaza (which turned out to be the best one since Monson), resupply at the supermarket, send home my trekking poles and bug headnet via a UPS, get another meal in town and then hike on once the heat of the day had dissipated. 

As I was eating a second town meal on a grassy verge, I spotted Footprint, Happy Feet, OK and Wizard at the Three Little Pigs barbecue restaurant. Half of Three Goldilocks and the Bear, Dr Bronner and Cricket, were also with them, doing 10-mile days so that the other half of the team, sisters Pumba and Professor Sprout, could catch up again after having to return home to North Carolina briefly for the funeral of a family friend. 

We headed out of town together but soon separated because of our different paces. Once I'd hauled up to the top of the mountain, the AT headed along the ridgeline as it made a grand U-shape towards McAfee Knob, about 15 miles away.

Just as I got to the ridgeline, a short but heavy storm front rolled through but it was still so hot that I'd have been as wet with sweat if I'd donned my rain gear. Instead I was happy to shelter under the Walmart umbrella I'd been hauling for 500+ miles since Harpers Ferry, using the theory that rain on the AT so far had tended to be either short and heavy or in such modest drizzle that it wasn't worth putting a rain jacket on. In this instance, the rain ended after 10 minutes, although the trail resembled a creekbed for the next hour or so before soaking into the soil.

A couple of hours after that, I rolled into Lambert's Meadow shelter, which was full of thru hikers and section hikers and who provided convivial company for the evening. 

The water source was the creek below, but even with the rainfall it was flowing so gently that I needed to borrow Dr Bronner's scoop -- a cut-down version of a SmartWater bottle, weighing only a few grams -- to get water from a shallow pool. Water is definitely becoming more of a problem, and I vowed when we headed to Roanoke in a few days, I'd create a scoop of my own.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: In the last week, water had started to become more of an issue, particularly since the nobocentric Guthook app was no longer always accurate about whether a source used by nobos in the spring is still reliable for sobos in the fall. One of the nice parts of trail culture is we put out word asking those ahead to report on what the water sources were actually like -- which is how we learned that Fullhardt Knob shelter's tank was empty -- and have set up a message network comprised of hikers ahead of and behind us to provide on-the-ground reports. This is all more proof of Scout's observation that ""this [thru hikers] is the community I've always wanted to be part of"".","Fullhardt Knob shelter
",Lambert's Meadow shelter,"Sep 20, Wed",14.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583097,"On any other day, visiting the most photogenic site on the entire AT and then a legendary trail restaurant would have been today's highlights. 

But this was no ordinary day and instead the best bit was an encounter with some day hikers in the midst of a rollercoaster section of ridge west of VA Route 311.

These were, of course, not just some random strangers. These were Three Gallon and Cucumber boy, who I'd last seen 11 years ago on the PCT somewhere in northern California.

I'd been present when they'd first met in the aircon break room of a wind farm that was the final rump of the Enron energy empire (which was being auctioned off that day, which might explain the leisurely pace of the staff and why they so generously welcomed us in to avoid the heat of the day). And I'd been present when that interaction, um, changed into something else a few days later. 

Just what that ""something else"" became was best demonstrated by the baby carrier Cucumber Boy was wearing and, in particular, the exceptionally smiley toddler, 20-month-old Sacha, contained within. 

That's not to diss McAfee Knob or the all-you-can-eat awesomeness of the Home Place, just off the trail at Catawba. An informal rule on the AT is that the merit of a restaurant is directly related to the number of states between it and when we first heard of it. We'd been hearing stories about the Home Place since the first week of our hikes, 10 states ago.

I knew all this was coming up today, which is why I'd opted to ""eat some spiders"" -- AT slang for being the first to hike the trail each day, at the cost of having to break through all the spider webs constructed overnight -- by leaving the shelter at 8am. 

I had a vague idea that it'd take three hours to get to McAfee's Knob but the trail went alongside Tinker Cliffs in a way that slowed my progress as I enjoyed the expansive views. Then at the shelter shortly before the final climb, I had to detour off to one side to fill up with water at a spring. Footprint joined me there and we got to watch a truly enormous black rat snake who was there first reluctantly slither off after it concluded we were not going to move on quickly enough for its liking.

Soon after, I'd sweated my way up to the top of the knob and made a quick side trip on a social trail to find the others, who had all enjoying a lazy and enjoyable morning. I was a little surprised to find they'd been joined by Pan, who I hadn't seen for a couple of weeks. He had been well ahead until he was delayed by rescuing a lost hunting dog. 

We were later joined by Ben, a sobo thru-hiker I'd last seen in Stratton in Maine and who I'd met briefly on the PCT when we both thru-hiked in 2006. He'd been hauling miles and was 300 miles ahead in Tennessee but the visa of his Teutonic hiking buddy -- BFG, which depending on who you talked to, stood for either Big Friendly German or Big F***ing German -- had run out so he got off trail. 

Like nearly all those hiking ahead of our sobo bubble, he'd ended up hiking on his own, cranking out long lonely days -- I remember thinking how I'd hate to hike the AT that way -- but he'd decided to take a few days off to meet his (non-hiking) girlfriend and come back to McAfee's Knob.

We eventually moved on around 12.30pm, thinking the way down would all be downhill and being surprised by how undulating the trail was. It was also stinking hot and we were definitely wilting, despite downing water in great quantities in a bid to stay hydrated.

We were particularly grateful when Ben offered to slackpack our gear to the Home Place restaurant, where he too was dining that night, allowing us to tackle the four mile ridge ahead without full packs. I was definitely down for that idea, although he later admitted that he'd forgotten just how bad a dozen well-used packs can smell, and particularly when the olfactory offence was flailing the unadjusted nostrils of his girlfriend.

It was nearly at the end of the ridge that I'd encountered Three Gallon, Cucumber Boy and Sacha. As I stopped to talk, we were quickly passed by everyone else. They were meeting Dirt's family at the road crossing a mile or so ahead, but we were happy to mosey along at the kind of pace a toddler can manage. The others were long gone by the time we reached the road, where we drove a couple of miles along to get to the Home Place.

The restaurant was worth the 11-state wait -- for $12, there all you can eat fried chicken, pulled pork, lucious buttery biscuits, mashed potato and ham and pea soup... It was simple but done spectacularly well, which explained why it was only open four days a week but had queues going out the door of the stately farmhouse set in rolling fields. With Ben, we had a mini-reunion of four PCT06 alumni.

It was great to catch up with my former PCT buddies and to see them doing well. They were talking about meeting up again to hike with me for a few days in the Grayson Highlands, which will provide an even better chance for a more expansive catchup.

Soon they were heading back to their home a couple of hours drive away and I was squeezing in beside the rest of Team KRT into Dirt's family's cars to make the trek to Roanoke for a night off the trail. 

Dirt's grandfather, Bill, and his daughter Stacie and her husband Shane proved to be gracious and generous hosts who had been well briefed about the realities of the trail and how we ought not to be deemed human until we'd showered and changed into clean clothes. We also put a load of washing on, using the never-before-used double-extra-heavy-duty wash option to counteract nine fetid days -- including climbing The Priest -- since the last wash.

Then in defiance of the usual bedtime of 8pm, we sat around shooting the shit with them until the unheard of hour of 11.30pm. A great night.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Although parenthood had obviously changed Three Gallon and Cucumber Boy's lives, they retained an element of thru hiker lifestyle because they were in the midst of building their own home in rural Virginia. I was embarrassed that I was meeting them after nine days since my last shower, but she quickly put me at ease by saying that the last time she'd had a hot shower was when visiting Scout in Daleville as he passed through more than a week before. After that it was all cold splash-washing with a bucket. Hiker trash FTW!","Fullhardt Knob shelter
",Catawba,"Sep 21, Thu",14.70
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583126,"As soon as Dirt casually announced that Roanoke had a farmers market, we knew the day was going to involve a leisurely start. 

We were more than OK with this. For a start, I'm always an enthusiastic supporter of indolence and we knew it'd also give Dirt and her grandfather time to catch up by heading to the market on their own.

And from the reports of the trail ahead, it seemed like we were going to more than make up for an early slothfulness by climbing to the Dragon's Tooth in the afternoon.

Our first mission this morning was to make an appropriately stodgy and cholesterol-laden breakfast of the kind the US does so well, after which the rest of us sat around in various depths of cholesterol coma. 

Once Dirt returned and then we were driven back to the road crossing around 12.30pm, such were our raging metabolisms that we immediately stopped for lunch. Team KRT is definitely an army that marches on its stomach.

We were eased into the day's endeavours by a short wander through farmland and then along a gently graded old road through a forest beside a gently burbling stream, which eventually led us to the road where Four Pines hostel was a short distance one way and the Home Place a few miles the other. 

Then, suitably warmed up, the real work began. At first it was just steep trail but then it started going through a series of short sections of steep but easy rock of a kind I hadn't seen since New England. 

Just as these were beginning to get a little tiresome, we reached the top of the ridge and hiked the side trail to Dragon's Tooth, an isolated crag made up of the same tilted rock strata we'd just ascended.

Simpleton and Jameson were there, having not been able to come back to the house the previous night because of Stacie's cats. They'd stayed in a hotel then hiked on to here today to wait for us and although he was too polite to say anything, it was clear he'd been waiting there for a while. 

After the others scaled the tooth, we kicked on along the undulating and rocky ridge that curved in a long U-shape. There was a shelter at the far end of this but it was half a mile off trail and the water was reportedly iffy, so we opted to continue instead to Trout Stream in the hope of finding campsites there. 

This confidence was rewarded when we found a great campsite just far enough off a small gravel road to be secure. 

Dirt had been hankering for a campfire so we made one nearby. If I'd been on my own, I'd probably have gone straight to bed and cooked from my sleeping bag but it was nice to have a convivial evening around the fire instead. Whiskey had been carried from Roanoke and the fireside tales were augmented by whiskey and peach drink mix that through a combination of imagination and wishful thinking, decided was the hiker trash equivalent of whiskey sours...

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Today we finally met someone I'd been steeling myself to seeing for more than a week: tighty-whitey man. http://www.trailjournals.com/journal/photos/20825/1148959 (That's Scout's photo, on a warmer day. For us, he had thankfully donned a shirt) It turned out his name is Omega and he was sort of thru-hiking, although it was tough to get much information out of him because his manner made Eeyore sound delusionally happy. A few minutes earlier, he'd encountered Sweetblood, a preternaturally happy person who tried to break through his funk by saying something about how even if he was having a bad day, he was still alive and out here so had reason to celebrate. ""It's better than being dead,"" she quipped. ""I suppose so,"" he said, clearly unsure! For me, he was asking about getting to the Home Place and I told him how long it'd taken us to climb up from the road. He was trying to get to the Home Place before it shut at 7pm but I heard days later he didn't manage to do the couple of miles to the road until 9pm...","Catawba
",Trout Creek,"Sep 22, Fri",9.50
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583156,"The highlights of Tinker Cliffs, McAfee Knob and the Dragon's Tooth proved to be but a brief aberration from the AT's business as usual: a series of long and mostly featureless forested ridgelines running in parallel with each other in a vaguely Georgia-ish direction. 

We certainly felt very familiar with today's agenda -- set off early when it was still cool, do a big climb up to a ridgeline which we'd follow for several hours, descend to a valley that is usually the only source of water before camp and then, in the heat of the day, sweat our way up to the top of a parallel ridge which we'd then follow for the rest of the day -- because apart from the last few days, it's what we'd been doing for more than a month. 

But at least now the trail is pretty good and even featured pleasant grades of the kind that made the 1600ft climb out of camp this morning entirely painless. 

And there were a few unique landmarks to distinguish today from the ""rinse and repeat"" cycle of the AT in Virginia. As we'd left camp, 2am advised us that there were benches marked on the AWOL guide at the top of the ridgeline. It became the goal for our first break.

These benches were at the Audie Murphy monument, named for the most decorated US soldier in the Second World War who survived that conflict but was killed in 1971 when his plane crashed into this ridge not far from this spot. Now there is a substantial granite monument bedecked in American flags and various forms of military paraphernalia. 

We only realised it was Saturday from the number of day hikers we encountered after the monument, which was more easily reached from the opposite direction. 

The next notable landmark came after we'd had lunch at Niday shelter, part of the way up the next parallel forested ridge, and found a sign signifying that we were standing astride the eastern continental divide. Water to one side of this ridge flowed into the Atlantic and water on the other flowed into the Gulf of Mexico.

There were yet more indications that there had once been farms on the crests of these ridges, presumably because the rainfall here was more reliable or maybe because the seemingly more valuable riverside land was unavailable.

If it had been up to us, these indications would have been in the form of old apple trees groaning with fruit but in this case it was mounds of rocks that had been shifted to improve the fields up here. It must have been a difficulty and hardscrabble existence. 

No other sign that this land had ever been cultivated remained and the forest had long since claimed back the vanity -- or desperation -- of these early farmers.

In time we left this ridge too and walked down into cleared farmland -- home of an enormous old oak that was reputed to be the second biggest on the trail -- then back into forest to the campsite that was our goal.

It was not a particularly nice campsite, featuring a couple of good sites but most of the others being sloping and substandard. But we made it work, got another fire going and had yet another convivial night before what's likely to be another day of rinse and repeat.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We've missed the worst of the heat, compared to nobos, but the last few days have been scorching. I drank a litre at lunch and carried two more out of Niday shelter but it was only just enough to get to our campsite. We're going to have to pay more attention to this as these dry post-equinoxial days continue.","Trout Creek
",Sinking Creek camsite,"Sep 23, Sat",18.10
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583235,"Sobos are people too! While the nobocentric nature of the trail is understandable, with about five times as many being GAME (going Georgia to Maine) rather than MEGA (Maine to Georgia), there are times when this gets too much.

Today was such a day.

A brand new hut register had been left at Laurel Creek shelter, which we reached early into today's hike, and the first page listed the mileage, elevation and the next shelter. The first and the third of these were for nobos, so we quickly added ""Nobo"" between ""next"" and ""shelter"" then added an extra line noting that the next sobo equivalent was War Spur shelter at (sobo) mile 1522.4.

It's a start -- sometimes you have to light a candle rather than curse the darkness.

This event was a small diversion from what for more than half of us had been a restless night because of the sub-standard campsite. 

Dirt had offered me one of the last sites in the main camp when we'd arrived together the previous evening but I demurred, preferring to be further away at a flatter spot right on the side trail. Based on the way her tent had slid down the slope from that site until it was literally wrapped around the tree beside which she'd camped, my option seemed remarkably prescient, even if it was primarily motivated by ensuring the others were outside the aural envelope of my snoring.

As we headed on through a mix of farm fields and short stretches of woods, we headed back up to the latest ridgeline after a short stop to adjust the nobocentricism of the Laurel Creek shelter register.

The 1000ft climb out of the shelter was steep and surprisingly overgrown, unlike most of the well-maintained sections of trail we'd been on, but at least 2am and Dirt were ahead, taking on the spider-eating duties for the rest of us.

I managed to do my share of arachnid ingestion later on when I unwittingly continued on when the others all took a side trail to a lookout. I remember thinking how quickly the spiders had rebuilt their webs and then, just before getting to War Spur shelter, encountered a truly enormous black rat snake sunning itself on the trail and wondered why it'd come back to the trail so quickly after presumably being disturbed by Dirt and 2am going by.

The more obvious conclusion -- that I was the first to come through -- only sunk in when I arrived at the shelter to find it empty.

Cauldron, a sobo ahead of us, was still amusing us with his register entries: ""The War Spur shelter was built as a memorial to the Nobo-Sobo war of '61. The war of nobo aggression is what sobos call it. Sobos were simply stating that they had done the hardest part of the trail first, while nobos were claiming all trails were created equally. Peace was finally reached when both sides agreed the real problem was 'can't make up their mind which direction' flip-floppers.

""PS: I'm so sure Blood Mountain is as hard as the Bigelows.""

There was one more big hill to come and then a long traverse along the ridgeline to the shelter that was our intended destination.

Another aspect of the trail's nobocentricism was that the water assessments by the guides -- AWOL and the Guthook app -- tended to be geared around typical conditions when nobos came through this way in Spring, a much wetter time of year than the fall.

It left us guessing which ones would be reliable for us, and having to be conservative by carrying spare litres as a Plan B. 

This hill showed just how difficult that process was, thanks to the complex and hidden hydrological factors of the Appalachians. Part of the way up the big climb from the shelter, we crossed a source described as reliable but which was bone dry.

But then the next source, described as unreliable and located much higher and next to the summit, was flowing gently into a pool. There must be some kind of aquifer at work, I thought to myself as I made a mental note to alert the other sobos about this via our water-report message group.

I'd been hiking with Simpleton on this section but he was not feeling enthused, having accidentally missed a trail turning as the AT crossed fields early on today and ended up walking a bonus half mile before realising his mistake and having to do another bonus half mile back again. 

So when he saw a sign showing a trail to VA Route 613 that was 1.5 miles, compared to 2.5 miles on the AT, he opted to take it as a shortcut. ""It goes to the road,"" I remember saying, ""but it might not be at same place as the AT."" But it wasn't marked at all on Guthook, so I didn't really know.

About an hour later, I reached the VA Route 613 and found a map on a sign that showed the two routes -- and that the shortcut Simpleton had taken did indeed take him to VA Route 613 but at a place two miles road walk from here, giving him three bonus miles for the day.

From there, we had a few miles along the ridgeline to the shelter but instead of being good trail on the crest of the ridge, as the AT has tended to do for the past few weeks, it stayed off on one side. Maybe there was a public access issue that explained this but the trail undulated along the side of the ridge, often becoming as rocky as anything in Pennsylvania, before finally levelling off a little just before the shelter.

A few section hikers were already in situ and we attended to the chores of getting water from the spring down the hill. I'd hoped to fill up at one of the reported springs on section of trail since VA Route 613 but none were flowing. In truth the descent and reascent was not too bad, and the way the water flowed directly from a pile of talus meant I didn't bother treating it.

Soon we had the circle of culinary friendship going, with the usual telling of tall tales and the last bit of the whiskey we'd been carrying since Roanoke.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We'd camped last night with a flip-flopper called Idaho Bones, with whom we'd been crossing paths since McAfee Knob. He was an unusual and interesting character and one of the reasons why he said he like to hike with us was because our presence might break his habit of not leaving camp before midday. He was still packing up when we left and we haven't seen him since...","Sinking Creek camsite

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583270,"Towns tend to become the intermediate goals on this five-month hike to Springer mountain. Well, not towns so much as what towns signify: town food, hot showers, clean clothes, resupply etc.

On this section, we'd been gearing up to visit Perisburg, with the idea that we'd do two 18-mile days and then we'd be five miles from town -- close enough to be there in time for breakfast. I was even contemplating going ahead of the others to have a town dinner and a night at one of Perisburg's hiker hostels.

But then we reached Ricefield Shelter, located about eight miles from town on a cleared ridgetop with commanding views over the rolling valleys of West Virginia, and it was Game Over. 

This kind of spontaneity is less common than it should be in the thru-hiking world, where too many people have a blinkered obsession with miles and schedules rather than what appears in front of them. One of the many reasons why I fit into Team KRT is we instantly voted to stay right here, even though it put us in the middle of a long dry stretch for which we hadn't prepared by camelling water for the night.

A shorter day too was a counterbalance against another night of less-than-ideal sleep. In this case, the culprits were one of the section hikers in the shelter rather than the sloping campsite. Unusually, Sweetblood and Sriracha had chosen to have the convenience of sleeping in Bailey Gap shelter rather than camping outside, but they paid a price when one of the section hikers snored like a bulldozer. All night.

We'd realised the previous night that the section hikers were a little odd. One was a nobo who was carrying a full-size hatchet, he said weighing ""only"" 1.5lbs. This was the source of his ostensible trail name, but among ourselves we dubbed him ""Axe Murderer"" instead. The other hiker, an older gentleman going southbound was strongly suspected of being the shelter snorer, which is why he was instantly (and surreptitiously) dubbed ""Snorchestra"".

The trail headed down to the valley then became rather more confused as it headed circuitously along a river then up and back down a creekbed via a switchback that had me confused when I could hear some of the others talking as they hiked but didn't catch up to them for a couple more miles.

This was a part of the AT that was famous for having a zip line across the river to the home of a trail angel called The Captain, who was as famous for his zip line as he was for the free camping space and the cold sodas he offered to passing hikers. But alas it seems he was no longer in business and instead all we had was a very loud Alsatian to show that we were near his home.

We hiked on to Pine Swamp Branch shelter, which was both particularly appealing -- it had a fireplace in the far wall of the three-wall stone shelter. which would have been perfect for a cold and wet day -- but also off limits, supposedly because of being threatened by dead trees. In truth, we couldn't see any directly threatening trees and it looked pretty much like every other shelter we'd slept in for the past month.

But we weren't aiming to stay anyway and it was a sunny hot morning. Instead we hiked another mile to the last creek crossing to fill up before the start of the big climb back onto the latest ridge. 

After the directness of the trail up to now, we thought the ascent would be a similarly brutal affair but in reality it was remarkably well graded, switchbacking up the hill at a wholly civilised grade. Once on the ridge, we were literally astride once again the Virginia-West Virginia border for the first time in about 300 miles. 

The ridge was mostly viewless and featureless, other than going through some semi-cleared areas that were in the process of being reclaimed by the forest and past a few old apple trees which were once again absolutely laden with ripe fruit. 

""This is sobo privilege!"" I told the others. ""Nobos don't get the benefit of this!"" But they were too busy harvesting apples to pay me any attention.

In time, we crossed a power line -- usually the only source of views on these forested ridges -- and then went past an AT&T cellphone station, which was possibly the only time when my phone registered better service than Verizon. An hour after that, we were striding towards the end of the ridge, which was truncated where the New River had cut through an ancient mountain ridge, when we suddenly came across the clearing containing Ricefield shelter. The shelter was nothing to write home about but the cleared area around it was something special.

Unusually, I was near the front at that point (mostly because the others had stopped at the weakest of trickling springs to fill their water supplies) and any thoughts about heading on instantly evaporated. As the others arrived in dribs and drabs, they too came to a separate but congruous decision. We had enough light left to go hunting for wood for a fire. 

Snorchestra, our suspected vocal companion of the previous night, arrived and headed to the shelter. I asked him if he'd brought a tent and he said he hadn't, thinking it wouldn't be too busy on the AT at that time of year. 

The sunset was everything we thought it would be. Most of the others are cowboy camping but even within an hour of dusk, it was clear there was going to be a massive dew overnight, prompting me to retreat to the shelter too.

This is a really special spot, and we'll still get to town in time for a late breakfast. WIN!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: It was odd to be back in West Virginia again, albeit briefly. There's a lot of talk about the ""Virginia blues"", because the AT stays in one state for one quarter of its overall distance and the trail itself tends to be on long, flat and forested ridgelines. But it's only going to take us about a month to get through Virginia and anyone who complains about that probably isn't well suited to the PCT, where it took three and a half months -- basically as long as we've been on the AT, crossing 11 states from Maine to Virginia -- to cross my first state border and enter Oregon.","Bailey Gap shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583307,"Technically, we've been in the South ever since crossing the Mason-Dixon line at the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, but despite going through some once-prosperous Rust Belt towns like Duncannon that voted overwhelmingly for Trump, we haven't really felt like we were in the real South.

Until Perisburg.

I was walking into town when a middle aged woman came rushing up to me as if I was a long-lost friend, introduced herself as Johnny and insisted me and my hiking buddies were welcome to come to her home -- a dilapidated shack and matching pool hall behind her -- to, as she put it, ""drink beer, smoke pot and part-AY"". (Yes, she really did say it as ""part-AY"")

""We're in the South. Ain't nobody gives a shit what you do here!"" she added, in a manner I believe was intended to be an endorsement. And she insisted on giving me a tour of the inside of her home and the powerless pool hall next door. I left with a promise that I'd extend her kind offer to the others in the tramily and we might be back. And by ""might be back"", I meant ""will avoid at all costs"". 

It was an odd interlude to an unusual morning. The others, who'd camped, were all dealing with the heavy dew overnight and I was the second one to hit the trail, just as the sun was rising at 7.20am. Sweetblood did spider-eating duties until the spring, 0.6 miles on, where I filled up with water, and after that the trail was amenable to extended conversations. Chatting to her about issues such as cultural appropriation -- ranging from everything from blackface (bad) to visiting tourists eating McDonalds instead of French cuisine in Paris (also bad) -- made the miles fly by to Pocahontas Road.

From here, the trail did a classic PUD -- pointless up and down -- over a hill between here and the New River. At the far side of this was a second, unexpected, PUD that finally took us to the highway bridge over the New River, leading to Perisburg.

As I was crossing this, I saw a guy on a bicycle with a trailer heading down the highway towards me. He saw me taking a photo of him and stopped to chat, which is how I found out that Hobo Harry was a metalworker who was heading from Buffalo in New York down to Florida to work on the rebuild after Hurricane Irma. He had been effectively homeless for the past five years, travelling from one place to another and donating most of his $30/hour salary to charity since he only needed about $200/month to live on. 

He was also clearly someone who hadn't had anyone to chat to for a while, based on the enthusiasm with which he launched into a conversation with me. And he was also clearly a kindred wandering spirit, so I suggested he join the tramily for our late breakfast in town.

Soon after that, I encountered and eventually escaped from Johnny's unorthodox but no doubt heartfelt hospitality and met the others outside the Lion supermarket, where we had a first breakfast before Team KRT and Hobo Harry headed up to La Barranca, the Mexican restaurant. 

Around 1pm, we waddled back to the supermarket to meet Neville from Woods Hole Hostel, 10 trail miles ahead, who was going to drive our packs to the hostel so we could slackpack. Just like Johnny, Neville was also female -- maybe it was something to do with Perisburg? -- but she also made a rather better first impression and we were looking forward to staying at a place about which we'd been hearing gushing as a haven of comfort and awesomeness on the AT. 

I was very grateful to be slackpacking because even though fuelled by Mexican food, the climb out of the valley to the top of the ridgeline in the heat of the day was a beast. The idea of doing it with four days of food as well as the usual pack weight did not bear contemplation. 

There were a few distractions to this grind, including meeting a group of women hikers coming the other way whose leader was carrying a truly enormous machete ""in case we meet a snake"". It's defensive capabilities were somewhat muted when they took a full five minutes to coax the machete from its disintegrating scabbard when I asked for a photo.

But mostly it was just a grind to Angel's Rest, a lookout on a rock with commanding views over the chemical factory we'd walked past earlier in the morning. After the viewpoint, we cruised along the standard flat forested AT ridgeline. 

We were hauling along because we knew that Woods Hole did an awesome communal organic meal each night from home-grown produce but weren't sure if it was 6pm or 7pm. As we got to within a couple of miles of the road crossing where we'd turn off the trail, Sriracha was hauling ass in his new ultra-lightweight Xero sandals when he tripped and ended up kicking a rock with his toes at full force. He's a pretty staunch hiker but he limped the rest of the way and we were all left wondered just how he'd be in the morning.

Woods Hole was a hickory log cabin that proved to be as awesome as it had been billed. Neville's grandparents opened it up for AT hikers decades earlier and although it was originally the grandfather's idea, the grandmother had adopted it after his death. Now the grandmother had died, Neville was running it with her husband, a former AT thru-hiker called Michael. Both were professional massage therapists and she did free yoga sessions each evening on the lawn. 

We were elated to discover that Footprint, an Austrian hiker we'd last seen at McAfee's Knob, had been here doing work-for-stay for the past few days after messing up her foot through doing big miles with the goal to finish the trail before her six-month visa ran out. Together with half a dozen section hikers, there are a bunch of us here. Soon we'd settled in, showered and then helped Neville, Footprint and others in the kitchen, making then cooking pizzas and creating a salad. 
With a hand-holding circle in which we said what we were thankful for that day, we tucked into some truly wonderful food. It turned out we all had the same idea -- this is such a nice place, we ought to delay our departure tomorrow for as long as possible.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The Mexican restaurant was not the only food option in town, which featured an all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant. But we deemed the price -- $6.95 -- to be too suspiciously low to trust what we were eating. And it was a good call, because Tuesdays at La Barranca is dollar taco day!","Ricefield shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583345,"For the second day in a row, we've been dissed by section hikers for our modest mileage aspirations. 

Yesterday it was by JB, a former AT thru hiker who was back out for a month, and today a LASHer* from DC called Siesta openly mocked our intended seven-mile day.

But we had the last laugh -- we didn't leave at all!

There were external reasons for this -- it had been a while since we'd had a full day off and, as suspected, Sriracha's little toe is pretty messed up from his unintentional soccer practice with a boulder yesterday afternoon.

But mostly it was because Woods Hole turned out to be an even cooler and more inviting place than the stories we'd heard, with the result that we just didn't want to leave. 

As an organic farm which creates and serves its own meals, this is a kind of nirvana for Dirt but she was ostensibly the keenest of us to move on -- but for reasons of finances rather than an actual desire to hike further. 

But the kind of place Woods Hole is -- and the reason why it's so welcoming -- was demonstrated by the existence of the Broke Hiker Jar. For obvious reasons, it's not advertised outside as such but visitors whose bank balances are a little more replete can donate to a jar used for those who are running short on cash to pay for meals and accommodation. This was tailor made for Dirt's situation, and I donated enough for someone to stay in the dorm and have a meal, so the end result was it came out even. Even without that, the jar was full of $20 notes among smaller denominations.

The cool vibe was also despite some obvious marital friction between Neville and Michael. She described him as ""an intense energy"" and I later heard a series of stories of enmity, although I never witnessed it myself. Running a place like this isn't for everyone and it was probably for the best that he was going to be taking the next year off, having adventures elsewhere.

For the rest of us, it was time to chill and play with the hyperkinetic kitten before we gathered for the 4pm group yoga session and then repaired to the kitchen to help create the latest evening repast.

Need I say it? Life is good.

AT fact of the day: I spent the day reading most of Grandma Gatewood's Walk, the story of an Ohio grandmother who was the sixth person and first woman to thru-hike the AT. It was particularly famous for her verdict on the trail immediately after she finished: ""I read about this trail three years ago in a magazine and the article told about the beautiful trail, how well marked it was, that it was cleared out and that there were shelters at the end of a good day's hike. I thought it would be a nice lark. It wasn't. There were terrible blow downs, burnt-over areas that were never re-marked, gravel and sand washouts, weeds and brush to your neck, and most of the shelters were blown down, burned down or so filthy I chose to sleep out of doors. This is no trail. This is a nightmare. For some fool reason they always lead you right up over the biggest rock to the top of the biggest mountain they can find. I've seen every fire station between here and Georgia. Why, an Indian would die laughing his head off if he saw those trails. I would never have started this trip if I had known how tough it was, but I couldn't and I wouldn't quit."" Still rings true, 60 years later!","Woods Hole hostel

I've been hiking with Team KRT long enough to know when they're tempted to give in to the vortex effect of a nice place and I rated the chances of leaving today as about even.

But I also knew that after one unplanned zero day here, we probably ought to escape the vortex and keep heading south while the weather was still good. As I put it to the others as I watched them waver towards indolence: ""I don't want to be hitting snow in the Smokies!"" 

(Since I'm updating this journal four months afterwards, I can now state that subsequent events showed I had a point!) 

And we did eventually leave, despite Footprint's vocal protests, around 11am. But it was a close run thing and I waited until I could actually see the others put on their packs and start hiking before I dismissed my concerns about a failure to launch. 

Simpleton and Jameson were also seemingly about to leave but we got a text later saying they hadn't. Neville had talked Simpleton into taking more days off to let Jameson's injured paw heal. It was the right decision but it was odd not to have been able to say goodbye to someone who'd been a member of our tramily for a while.

Once back on the trail, the hiking was undemanding, following the ridge for about six dry miles and then heading down a valley. The vegetation has started to change too, with thick stands of rhododendron becoming more common, with the result that the AT sometimes appeared to be more like a tunnel than a trail as it worked its way through the thickets.

I stopped for a break at Wapiti shelter and found, from glancing through the register, that it might more accurately have been dubbed Heartbreak Hotel. A week or so earlier, there was an entry from a hiker I knew -- let's call him F -- who wrote: ""The last seven miles [from Woods Hole] were the most difficult for me so far on trail. Every step I took the better I felt, or at least that's what I'm trying to convince myself. Lying here alone, nauseous, an empty stomach and a broken heart. Tonight's sleep will be minimal at best."" 

And a couple of entries later was another hiker we knew -- let's call her D -- who wrote: ""I've lost both my hiking partners within a few days and I'm heartbroken. [F] and [B, who got off trail], I'm grateful for the miles I spent with you. Hiking with people is always a compromise in some way. I guess now is the time for me to be selfish on this trip and hike solely for myself.""

And a few weeks before that was an entry from Bookworm, the nobo we met in the Shenandoahs who'd been averaging seven miles a day over the past four months, who was talking about the emotional effects of splitting up with his hiking partner, although there was no matching comment from the other side.

I hiked on, finding cruisy miles down to the turnoff to Dismal Falls, where I met the others. The falls weren't roaring, as befits the long dry spell we've been enjoying, but they certainly weren't dismal either and they provided a place for us to chill the beers we'd carried from Woods Hole and also a great place to cook. After cooking, we wandered back to an excellent campsite a couple of minutes away.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: One of Team KRT's idiosyncrasies are the bird calls we've been using to communicate whether we were ahead or behind the others on trail. Sriracha is ""Caw!"", Sweetblood is ""Coo!"" and mine has been ""CaWAA!"".

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583419,"I'd been chatting to the random nobo hiker for about 10 minutes when I stopped, paused and said: ""Are you... Sail Away?""

She looked suitably shocked. Which is to say, she was indeed Sail Away, but had no idea how I could possibly have known who she was.

Scout and I had been told about her months earlier when we visited Dick Anderson, the guy who'd had the original idea for the International Appalachian Trail, which continued north from Mt Katahdin into Canada and then, eventually, across the north Atlantic and down to Morocco.

(Keen readers of this journal will also remember that I didn't have much beta before that meeting in a Portland, ME, nursing home and managed to exemplify my capacity for faux pas by asking Dick what his connection to the IAT was.)

Sail -- as she said she was known for short -- was aiming to be the first person to hike all 20,000 miles of the IAT. Dick had heard she expected it to take five years but Sail said was now expecting it to be seven years. Not least because she barely had enough money to complete this year's hike, which she expected to be as far as she could get before winter stopped her. 
It was her reference to having started in Alabama rather than Georgia that made me realise who she was.
I'm known for chatting to almost every hiker I encounter, which probably explains why this, the shortest of the triple crown of US hiking, was taking me longer than either the PCT or the CDT. 

And it has to be acknowledged that some of the reactions I get -- particularly by the short-distance hikers who still possess that uniquely American paranoia about stranger danger -- have been less than ideal. 

But it also leads to encounters such as this one. I'd been hoping to cross paths with Sail Away for months but assumed we must have passed without meeting somewhere in New England. It turned out I'd been too generous in predicting her daily mileage because, like me, she preferred a more relaxed hiking schedule that allowed her to smell all the roses -- metaphorical and literal -- en route. 

We might even have missed each other that morning, since Sriracha, Sweetblood and I took a short cut along a road to Trent's Grocery rather than taking the AT, which did an even more pointless than usual PUD up and over a hill before descending to VA Route 606. Dirt, who has vowed to hike every foot of the AT, and 2am, who does that but also eschews slackpacking, were Team KRT's purist offshoot and took the real AT.

We all met up again at Trent's grocery, a gas station and general store that seemed to be like a modernised version of a Norman Rockwell painting, with good ole boys in bib coveralls sitting around literally talking about things like shooting squirrels. The grocery had enough hiking-type food for a reasonable resupply and also offered BLTs for breakfast, along with coffee. In keeping with the increasingly unreliable water supplies, I also bought a bottle of sweet tea to increase my carrying capacity by a litre.

That proved to be a good call and most of the day was dry or featured dodgy sources. There was apparently water somewhere a long way down a creek at Jenny Knob shelter but otherwise the only water I saw on trail was a couple of skanky pools that had enough slime in them to suggest they were leftover from the last rain rather than flowing from some hidden spring beneath.

The hiking along the ridgelines, using trail or old logging roads, was so deficient in landmarks that afternoon that I ended up turning on my GPS feature on my phone -- usually turned off to extend battery life -- to confirm that I was where I thought I was. And I was, but that came at the cost of finding I also had five bars of service, which led me to waste the next half hour sending a series of texts to various far-flung friends.

This meant I was the last one to rock up into camp at Helveys Mill shelter, where there was a good source of water reached by a very steep 0.2 mile trail straight down a hill. I was not particularly looking forward to this but was resigned to it, only to find out that when Dirt, Sweetblood and 2am had gone down, they'd hauled up enough water for me as well.

""You guys,"" I said, with genuine emotion, ""are epic and awesome.""

The shelter log book made many references to mice and rats so it was an easy decision to camp in a beautiful cleared area a minute's walk away, where there's plenty of room for a fire and we even found some artists had been painting mushrooms and slogans on random trees.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: After a long spell of warm weather, the night's are just getting the first hint of a chill. I usually sleep uncovered but midway through the night have to drag my opened sleeping bag onto me as a kind of quilt. It's only a 40degF bag but I'm yet to zip it up on this entire hike so far. That day must be drawing ever closer.","Dismal Falls

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583475,"A polar blast that blew through in the second half of today has given us what I suspect is a taste of what's to come on our hike. 

Sweating through the middle of the day has been far more of an issue than concerns about hypothermia, but we all knew that colder weather would eventually transpire. It's part of the reason why we reluctantly motivated ourselves to escape the vortex of Woods Hole.

But it has been fascinating to see how quickly it went to the other extreme. For the first time since leaving the Canadian border four months ago, I had to zip up my sleeping bag tonight. But even after doing that, I was still on the cold side of comfortable in a 40degF bag.

The only good side of this was it is likely to mean the difficulties of the long distances between water -- and today, our aqua beta from Young Scout alerted us to a 16-mile stretch without any place to top up -- are not going to be as onerous because lower temperatures will mean we will need less water.

The previous evening, I'd been telling 2am about the katabatic effect -- the way cold air flows downhill at night -- to explain why it's usually warmer to sleep higher on a ridge than lower down in a valley. But I could also tell he didn't quite believe me, putting more faith into the more understandable but oversimplistic theory that temperature is a direct reflection of altitude.

However the first hour of hiking today provided a powerful lesson about the katabatic effect. It was mildly chilly at our campsite on the crest of the ridge but as we dropped down into the valley, the temperature dropped dramatically in the final 20m to the valley floor.

This brought us to a road which led over an Interstate -- an AT tradition is to moon the traffic on every Interstate, and for the first time I decided to join this less-than-esteemed club -- and then half a mile after this, we reached a diner right on the trail, named the Brushy Mountain Outpost. 

This had only opened in June but such is the power of food and the nature of trail gossip, we'd known of its existence for nearly as long. I was the first to arrive and was soon sating my carb and cholesterol cravings in the form of biscuits, gravy, eggs, bacon and coffee. 

Even better was that the person at the next table was Mongo, who ran the nearby Lickskillet hostel. He'd started as a nobo a few years ago but only got as far as here before getting off trail. He ended up working at a hostel in the area and then last year he'd bought a 1911 church for $15,000 and turned it into a donation-based hostel.

As I chatted to him about the 16-mile waterless stretch we had coming up, he said he was heading to a road crossing, VA Route 623, later that day to drop a section hiker off. This is where we were intending to camp.
A little light bulb went off in my head: ""Is there any chance you could drop some water for us there?"" He was willing to pay for this himself -- it shows what kind of person he is -- but instead I insisted on giving him $10 so he could buy 10 gallons -- enough for us and for quite a few of the hikers behind us. Deal!

One of the AT catchphrases is ""10 by 10"", meaning doing 10 miles before 10am, usually as a way to avoid the worst of the heat in the midAtlantics. Thanks to the effect of the diner, by the time we managed to escape this latest cholesterol vortex, we'd done 2.2 miles by 11.15am, which is not quite the same.

We were fortunate that the next section of the trail is maintained by the Piedmont Appalachian Trail Club, which had created some of the nicest trail we'd encountered yet. Mostly it contoured around hills rather than going straight up and down the other side in a pointless display of wasted energy. 

Thanks to the quality of the trail, the rest of the day went pretty easily despite a solid 1700ft climb up to the ridgeline after the last water source. I was very grateful not to be doing this with four litres of water in my pack and also not to be doing this on a stinking hot day.

We knew Dirt's extended family was aiming to do a trailside cookout for us tomorrow where we were camping tonight, meaning we'll have an on-trail nero tomorrow. 

Normally this would be a good thing but such was the polar chill that had descended that we couldn't even stay warm enough even while sitting around the fire and so we all ended up retreating into our tents early, where we tried -- with various degrees of success -- to stay on the comfortable side of cold.
But tomorrow we're going to be lavished with southern hospitality. WIN!

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Last night, I used Vitamin I -- as the anti-inflammatory ibruprofen is known in the hiking world -- for the first time since, I think, Vermont and certainly not since I left New England. I was happy to have reduced my use of Vitamin I from a worrying 800mg a day in the wilds of Maine down to nothing through reducing my mileage and taking better care of myself. Today my right knee felt fine and hopefully this was just a one-off rather than the sign of the long-term affects of hiking.","Helveys Mill shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583517,"I've never witnessed a military invasion but I've now seen the next best thing: southern trail magic from Dirt's extended family.

One moment, we were sitting around the fire in the middle of the day and then the next a convoy of cars pull up and out step nearly a dozen people. Soon they're pulling out trestle tables, crock pots, saucepans and coolers to set up a trailside meal.

Although ""meal"" doesn't come close to covering what is soon weighing down the tables. There must be 20+ kinds of food here: salads, stews, lasagna, chicken, rolls, fruit, cookies... It was a tsunami of food in quantities that could probably feed more than twice as many people as are present. And there was chilled craft beer.

""Oh, this?"" said one of the women who helped create this repast. ""Oh, this is just what we make every Sunday.""

The day was relevant because they'd picked today to do trail magic after attending church in the morning. They'd then headed home to finish creating this meal and driven an hour or so to where we were waiting beside VA Route 623.

And this isn't even Dirt's direct family. Her mom's new partner, Ricky, has arranged this with members of his family. It was southern hospitality of the kind you read about in books.

We'd waited most of the day for this and although I'm usually all about indolence, the polar blast of air that chilled us last night continued unabated, which is why we were huddled around the fire in what would normally have been the enervating heat of the middle of the day.

Sriracha and Sweetblood had solved the warmth problem by welcoming Dirt into their tent and using the five bars of phone service to stream episodes of Rick and Morty and The New Girl. They reported, in between giggling fits from watching the shows, that having three in the tent made it toasty.

The daily battle of the bladder was the only reason why I eventually emerged from my tent, after which 2am and I got the fire going. As we were festering the morning away, Trail Snail and another Happy Feet (a retired man rather than the young woman of that name) arrived but opted not to wait around for the trail magic.

Then Three Goldilocks and the Bear -- reunited once more after the two sisters had to briefly get off trail for a family funeral -- arrived and happily took up places around the fire until the hospitality horde arrived, at which point they contemplated moving on out of a sense of politeless and lack of entitlement but happily were convinced to stay and enjoy the repast.

We ate ourselves to a standstill, filled ziplok bags full of leftovers and still seemed to have had barely any impact on the volume of food. 

Three Goldilocks and the Bear headed on as our benefactors packed up and left, but I said to the rest of Team KRT that I was incapable of walking until I'd spent at least half an hour digesting. The others agreed.

Once we felt capable of forward progress, we had a vague goal of eight miles to a dam which was the end of our 16-mile waterless stretch but we only managed six miles, to Chestnut Knob shelter.

This was a former fire lookout cabin and unlike the usual AT shelters, didn't have an open side and was made with thick stone walls. After a steep climb up a hill, which was a grateful way to stay warm in the midst of a cold-ass day, we walked into the sun-warmed interior of the shelter and instantly opted to stay here.

Cricket and Pumba from Three Goldilocks and the Bear opted to go on to the dam, while Dr Bronner and Professor Sprout opted to stay with us, alongside a section hiker.

Hours later, I'm still barely hungry and I'm eating out of the doggy bags from lunch, although this is more out of an interest in lowering my pack weight than because of actual hunger. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: I'm still slowly getting used to being in the South, and particularly the habit of saying grace before eating. I'm fully on board with it -- it is, after all, just a version of mindfulness and gratitude -- but it's also contrary to a lifetime of secular/heathen experience of eating as soon as the food is served.","VA Route 623

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583549,"The way hikers have started to deck themselves out in fluorescent colours for hunting season provides a gentle hint that -- let me phrase this delicately -- Americans' enthusiastic application of their second amendment rights is not always matched by their ability to exercise them safely.

My last couple of weeks on the PCT was in hunting season but I was grateful that the first of those weeks was for bow hunters only. Possibly because it's much more difficult -- you need to be within 30m of an elk before firing -- they tended to be almost exclusively comprised of people who had opposable thumbs and the ability to form complex sentences. 

The contrast to rifle hunters was exemplified the following week when we met one beer-bellied bubba-style hunter who was standing beside the trail with a can of Bud in his hand. When we asked how the hunting was going, he replied: ""Hell, I haven't even got to camp yet.""

Today, the constant baying of dogs throughout the morning removed any chance of pretending it wasn't hunting season. Once we reached Lynn Camp Creek, we encountered half a dozen hunting dogs wearing heavy radio-tracking collars, while in the woods to our south, there were clearly many more dogs barking furiously but not apparently moving.

We were told later that the dogs had treed a bear. We never saw the hunters, who would have seen from their radio-tracking systems that the dogs had stopped in one place and would be making their way to it, with the bear unaware that by taking refuge up a tree, it was actually sealing its fate.

As hunting goes, this was barely more sporting than the bear hunters of Matagammon hunting camp back on the IAT in Maine, who spend a month stocking a cache in the woods with doughnuts to entice bears to it and then courageously wait in a hide a safe distance away and use high-powered rifles to shoot any unfortunate bruin that appears for its daily feed.

Hopefully this treed bear would be underage and thus be allowed, begrudgingly, to live. I didn't think this was very likely, but sometimes it's better to harbour a deluded hope than to dwell too long on an unpleasant reality.

That morning, we'd woken in our enclosed stone hut and were inestimably grateful to find (a) it was still much warmer than the ambient temperatures outside, and (b) our prediction that the middle-aged and portly section hiker would snore like a D12 bulldozer was happily unfounded.

Outside, there was a particularly beautiful view down into the fog-shrouded Burke Garden but it was also a cold-ass day and I headed off rugged up in my fleece and wooly hat, only able to ditch these after hiking for half an hour.

Once I'd warmed up, so had the day. The cold blast of the past 48 hours seems to have passed and we went back to the sweaty business-as-usual as we slogged up and down hills via the continuingly excellent Piedmont Appalachian Trail Club trails.

We stopped for lunch at Knot Maul Branch shelter, which was remarkably primarily for having a tiny barely-four-person picnic table that was presumably salvaged after a tree smashed into the full size ones we're more familiar with.

""Is this a table for ants?"" Sriracha exclaimed, in his best Zoolander voice, only to find that the register wit, Cauldron, had made the exact same comment as he came through a couple of weeks earlier. Great minds thinking alike? Or fools never differing? We opted for the former.

At the top of the climb following that, we had to negotiate an enormous blowdown. Given Hurricane Irma was just one of several storms that had devastated the southern AT, it was remarkable that this was the only bad blowdown we'd encountered. The presence of fresh sawdust besides clearly recent blowdowns before and after this one showed both the diligence of local trail maintainers and also how much tougher the trail would be without their efforts. 

As the trail crossed VA Route 40, I noticed a black van beside the road and found Hot Mess, another sobo and different to the Hot Mess Express who was still in the thrall of the Yellow Deli religious community up in Vermont. It turned out this Hot Mess had injured herself a while back and was now doing support for her partner, Bog Angel, and another sobo called Milkshake.

She was kind enough to offer me some water, which proved to be a propitious offer. The trail from there began to traverse a series of fields, making the next water sources were very rural and bovine in nature. I could have filled up but was able not to have to, although I was completely out of water when I finally rocked up into camp.

As I reached Reed Creek, I found a message from Three Goldilocks and the Bear at a trail junction, asking us to join them in their camp. I also found 2am, who'd wandered around for 20 minutes trying to find the campsite without luck. He eventually concluded that it was further down the trail and then, to save Dirt and Sriracha from going through similarly pointless searching, I waited for them at the junction to let them know.

Soon we were all united once more at the campsite, which was about five minutes further down the trail. A fire was going and we were soon cooking and catching up with each others' movements. Having been doing effectively identical pace to them since Vermont, there was talk about all of us finishing together -- an appealing prospect.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Our predecessors at last night's shelter were clearly fans of one of my favourite movies of all time, The Shawshank Redemption. On a beam on ceiling, one person had written ""Brooks was here"" and next to it, in a different hand, someone else had penned: ""So was Red."" We hope he eventually found Andy.","Chestnut Knob shelter
",Reed Creek,"Oct 02, Mon",17.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583587,"How do you pick between today's highlights? We hit the three-quarter mark on the trail. We met Sriracha's parents and grandmother and had lunch with them at a Mexican restaurant. Our packs are now laden with granny's homemade fudge. Tonight's shelter is not only ridiculously luxurious (showers!) but also one of only a few on the trail where you can order pizza to be delivered -- and we did.

Against that competition, it says something that my personal highlight for the day was Long John Silver's response to the list of 19th Century school punishments displayed at Lindamood Schoolhouse.

The original 24 punishments were amusing enough: boys and girls caught playing together would receive four lashes. Drinking ""spiritous liquors"" at school merited eight lashes but playing cards earned you 10. Building swings and climbing trees was similarly proscribed.

Long John Silver penned his response at Chatfield shelter, the next one south after we left the one-room 1894 schoolhouse. Clearly he'd had some hiking time to come up with 20 trail sins, which included: Neglecting to bear bag (one lash), Yellow blazing (two lashes), bitching about the White Mountains (four lashes), Enjoying Connecticut (five lashes) and -- worst of all -- asking if I'm going the whole way (10 lashes).

Overall, it was quite an eventful day. That was good because it was also a pretty dreary day in terms of the actual hiking terrain, in which we cruised out miles through yet more of the long green tunnel.

After our two-day cold spell, temperatures this morning were back to normal and that made it easier to get going. But with the prospect of town food only a few hours away in Atkins, there was never any doubt that we'd have a powerful incentive to hike.

Just as we were about to get underway, a couple who were clearly thru-hiking -- let's just say that there's a look that people get after more than a thousand miles which is immediately recognisable to those who have done the same -- came barrelling through on trail and steadfastly ignored the cheery greeting that Sweetblood and others made to them. Ah well, they're hiking their own hike. 

Just as we'd reached camp the previous evening we'd passed a big sign supposedly signifying the trail's three-quarter mark (although in true nobocentric fashion, it was marked solely as the ""one quarter"" mark). Like all such permanent signs, it was now in the wrong place because of the southern half of the trail being lengthened by namby pamby initiatives such as switchbacks.

The current three-quarters mark was a few miles into today's hike but I could see from Guthook that it was at a point -- where the trail rejoined the ridgetop after traversing around a knoll -- that might not be obvious on the ground. But after keeping a close eye on the interaction between the trail and the terrain, I was pretty confident I found the right spot then spent a little while turning some sticks into a ""3/4"" sign beside the trail.

From there, the trail took me past the site of a former shelter which seemed to have burned down -- the steps up to it still existed, along with the stumps on which it sat but, Ozymandias style, nothing else remained. Now it was a campsite rather than a shelter.

That in turn took us into a series of agricultural fields and eventually into Atkins, an interstate services town which we reached via an underpass that deprived us of the juvenile satisfaction of mooning the passing traffic.

In keeping with the tramily's southern origins -- Dirt was from Damascus, less than a week away, while Sriracha and Sweetblood were both from North Carolina -- we're getting into the zone of serious familial trail magic. Today it was Sriracha's parents and grandmother, who insisted on paying for our lunch at the Mexican restaurant, El Burrito Loco, connected to a gas station.

It says something about hiking vs non-hiking metabolisms that we inhaled the hiker special -- the mountain man burrito -- while Sriracha's family struggled to eat more than half.

But it was also nice to see an example of family support in action, especially when my own is so far away. Although there was a tense moment when Sriracha casually announced our intended finish date is November 11, a week later than his mother, a nurse, had arranged to take time off so she can be present...

Lunch fuelled the rest of the afternoon, as we headed to Lindamood Schoolhouse, where AT hikers are welcome to stay overnight, and then up to Chatfield shelter, where Long John Silver's wit kept us amused for the rest of the miles to Partnership shelter. 

This was a very popular place, and for good reason. Besides being an awesome two-level shelter with showers and water taps, there was also pizza delivery. 

It helped explain why everyone nearby had converged on this place, making 19 of us in total. Besides Team KRT, there was also Three Goldilocks and the Bear, a flip flopper called Idaho Bones, several section hikers and Pinkman, a sobo thru-hiker who'd been living here for four days while recovering from a staph infection.

The others had gone to a Walmart and returned with a slab of beers, which we consumed around the fire while waiting for our pizza order -- 11 family-size pizzas for 19 of us -- to arrive.

This has been a good day. Life is good.

AT fact of the day: In stark contrast to today's many highlights was a definite lowlight. I received a message from a friend in New Zealand that her father, Norman Hardie, had gone into palliative care. Norman was a remarkable man -- just one of innumerable accomplishments was he made the first ascent of Kangchenjunga, the world's third highest peak, while on the four-person reconnaissance trip in 1955. The full-scale ascent team being assembled for the following year was the same crew that had made the first ascent of Everest two years earlier and Norman and the others knew they were unlikely to be in summit parties then so he and his friends on the reconnaissance ""gave it a good nudge"" and all four reached the summit. My favourite memories of him are of walking alongside him in New Zealand's southern alps -- a pace that lent him to tell tales of his younger years -- and each night in the hut, when he created hot toddies that remain my gold standard for such drinks. While walking today, I was also in touch with my old newspaper in New Zealand to set up Norman's obituary so that despite the depleted newsroom sizes of modern journalism, it would be done properly by someone who knew something about mountaineering. Combined with also trying to arrange to hike with Three Gallon and Cucumber Boy in the Grayson Highlands, I had a lot of metaphorical balls in the air today...","Reed Creek
",Partnership shelter,"Oct 03, Tue",18.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583617,"There's a cost that comes from having as many metaphorical balls up in the air as I did yesterday, when I was coming to terms with my friend in New Zealand going into palliative care and getting in touch with my old newspaper there to prepare his obituary, while also trying to arrange to meet up with Three Gallon, Cucumber Boy and Sacha to hike in the Grayson Highlands -- and trying to do all this with crappy AT&T connectivity. 
That cost emerged midway through today when I realised I was a day out of sync with Three Gallon and Cucumber boy, thinking I was meeting them tomorrow when they actually expected to meet the day after.
I'd headed off ahead of the rest of Team KRT because I thought I'd need to do 23 miles today -- doable, but a long day -- to meet Three Gallon and co at the shelter they were aiming to reach. 
But around midday I got a message from them saying I was a day ahead of the schedule we'd discussed. The trouble was that I only had a day and a half of food and was relying on them for my next resupply. 
This was further compounded by not being sure if my reply reached them. My phone claimed to have service and the message status was listed by it as ""sending"", but no particular indication that it had actually been sent. I figured I'd let future me worry about that.
I explained this food dilemma to Three Goldilocks and the Bear when I met them at Trimpi shelter and Cricket was kind enough to lend me the spare meal she'd been carrying, possibly for quite a while. Together with some fudge and cookies I'd cadged from Sriracha's supply from his granny -- as I was leaving Partnership shelter, he said: ""It's dangerous to go alone. Take this."" -- I figured I'd be OK. 
Trimpi shelter was another example of the enticing shelters in the South. It was an attractive stone-walled structure with a fireplace in the far wall that would be perfect on a wet spring day. Even on a warm fall day, it was still a nice place to spend a little time.
Water was flowing from a piped spring near the shelter in just enough quantity to make it viable, which was important because it took a while to reach the next source. It was in the middle of this dry stretch that the rest of Team KRT was aiming to reach tonight.
I thought about pushing on to Old Orchard shelter, where Three Gallon and co were going to reach tomorrow, but in the absence of any word from them, I opted instead for an easier day and stopped four miles short at Hurricane Ridge shelter.
Three Goldilocks and the Bear were present, as was a young hiker called Tea Time, who I'd met just before McAfee Knob. He was an 18-year-old who'd started on the AT as a whim after hitchhiking the Blue Ridge Parkway and had been switching between hiking and yellow blazing his way around, including hitching from Partnership shelter to here via the road. He was an interesting guy but also very young and had virtually no money. He slept beside the fire in a US Red Cross blanket to augment a very thin sleeping bag.
But it was still a convivial night of conversation around the fire. And I have enough food to meet my friends tomorrow.
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: One of the guys who was at Partnership shelter was a flip-flopper who had also yellow-blazed from there but wasn't at this shelter tonight. He had spoke to me wondering why some groups, such as the Goldilocks, seemed to be unfriendly to him. Maybe he couldn't remember last night when, having drunk rather more communal beers than he paid for, he'd racked out next to the Goldilocks women and went on to recount, in loud voice and vivid detail, all the women he'd slept with since starting the trail. Maybe that was it? I guess we'll never know...","Partnership shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583668,"We were hiking along through the Grayson Highlands wondering when -- or even if -- we were going to see the ponies.

Others hiking in the opposite direction had talked about seeing ponies and even longhorn cattle but for us, we've seen bupkis. And then we saw movement under a stand of low trees

It turns out the ponies are smarter than us and have been avoiding the heat of the day by staying in the shade of the forest. There are about 10 of them, ranging full grown males -- although even they were comically short and barrel-chested -- down to whatever a pony's pony is called.

There's always been a awkward distinction when cute animals also turn out to be wild and these ponies -- brought up to the highlands and released to keep the balds from revegetating -- have been wild for the best part of a century. 

We'd heard cautionary tales that despite looking like a species so easily anthropomorphisable that they ought to feature in a show like the Teletubbies, they need to be approached with caution. Most of them were very approachable but when one of us got to close to one of them for comfort, the reaction quickly reminded us of the need to keep our distance.

But still.... ponies!

This was pretty exciting for me but 20-month-old Sacha, in his mother's child carrier pack, was wide-eyed with excitement. And his mum, Cucumber Boy, became pretty excited too -- albeit for different reasons, when one of the ponies rears up at us as a warning to stay further away.

It turned out that Three Gallon and Cucumber Boy -- TG and Q, as I'd dubbed them in my 2006 PCT journal -- had received my text messages the day before and, just to add more comedic miscommunication and because the universe has a sense of humour, they received them in a different order to how they were sent. 

But, kindhearted people that they are, they'd moved their schedule forward by a day to compensate for me getting the dates wrong and being a day ahead of when we'd originally agreed to meet. 

I realised all this when I reached the road crossing a few miles into today's hike and found their car sitting there. It had dew on it, which showed they'd got there the previous day. Dang! I should have hiked on to the shelter last night!

I checked the front car door and it was open, giving me access to the extra cold-weather clothing I'd mailed to them to bring to me and also to the food they'd bought for me. It'd been a few years since they'd thru-hiked but they remembered the unusual calorific requirements and the stash included Little Debbie cosmic brownies, which Q assured me had the highest calorie:gram ratio of any food she knew.

And there was beer! I only have to hike about seven more miles today, so I grabbed eight cans as a surprise for the other members of Team KRT when we reunite at Wilson Creek shelter tonight.

It was about a mile and a half of gentle but steady uphill to get to Old Orchard shelter, where I found TG and Q just as they were packing up. Q opted to head on with Sacha hiking as far as he could before resuming his place in the baby carrier while TG and I headed down to the spring to fill up with water for the day.

The easy PCT-style grade of the trail after the shelter allowed us to chat as we ambled our way towards Q and Sacha. There's something about trail conversations that make them easier than the equivalents in town, which is part of the reason why I was glad we were going to be able to spend a couple of days hiking together rather than only seeing them in the hectic environment of the Homeplace restaurant a few weeks earlier.

Soon enough we caught up with Sacha, who was making his way determinedly up the trail while being watched vigilantly from behind by Q. 

Sacha took his place in the backpack once the trail became rockier -- and thus the consequences of a stumble more serious -- but we were still able to make steady progress uphill. Q was carrying Sacha and a few of the essentials but TG was carrying everything else. As any parent of a toddler will know, that's a LOT.

They tried to put Sacha down for a mid-afternoon sleep but there was WAY too much stimulation going on for that to happen and he spent his time vacillating between stages of tiredness and meltdown -- I'm sure half the time hikers came by us, they were convinced they were walking into a child sacrifice. After it became obvious that sleep wasn't going to happen, we opted to continue.

As we headed onto the rolling highlands and through The Scales, where stock was mustered and weighed back in the old days of commercial grazing, there had no sign of any ponies. Then, a mile or so later, we realised they'd all been hiding in the trees.

When we finally moved on again after our pony encounter, it was an easy downhill run through forest to the shelter where we were spending the night. I put the others' beers in the cold water of the creek to chill them then went about the important tasks of keeping Sacha entertained. This was a kid with serious energy, as well as a perpetual smile.

The others in Team KRT rocked up through the afternoon and we caught up on each other's news, including the dry camp they'd made the previous night that ended up being next to the nest of some kind of bird that had scared the crap out of them by having a screech that they all assured me was absolutely identical to a woman being murdered. It must have been an entertaining night.

Happy Feet and OK are also here, along with Milkshake, Bog Angel and Hot Mess and a few other section hikers. It was good to give TG and Q a taste of trail life again, and particularly the extra fun that comes from being in a good group. 

Sacha is a pretty easy kid he is to look after, although he was getting very clumsy and stumbling through tiredness -- just like thru-hikers, I thought to myself -- shortly before they headed off to their tent right on dark.

The rest of us squeezed into the shelter, where attempts to get to sleep were displaced by fits of laughter as we joked around in the dark.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Q had already hiked the AT before meeting TG on the PCT. They finished that over a couple of years and have also done a solid chunk of the CDT. With his parents having done 10,000 miles of hiking, it's fair to say that nature and nurture were both conspiring to make Sacha a hiking prodigy.","Hurricane Mountain shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583726,"When we reached the heart of pony territory, we came prepared. Thanks to Dirt's grandfather, we had a supply of apples.

But it turns out that while the Grayson Highland ponies were happy to accept apples, there was something else they craved and knew that thru-hikers had in plentiful supply: sweat. 

About a nanosecond after the apple was eaten, one of the ponies went straight for my legs and started licking off the salt from eight(!) days of accumulated sweat. Ewwww! (For the pony -- it was the closest I'd had to a shower in a week)

This experience was bookended by two sessions of Dirt family trail magic. We started the day needing to do a ""one by 10"" -- one mile by 10am -- to meet with Dirt's grandfather and swap 90% of our packs' weights for apples. 

And we were being picked up by Dirt's mum and Ricky that afternoon and being taken to their comfortable hilltop home for several nights of sleeping indoors, hot showers and all the other accoutrements of civilisation. 

Back at the shelter this morning, the benefit of Sacha missing his afternoon nap the previous day came in him sleeping through until 7am. As any parent will attest, this is the Best Thing Ever. The previous day he'd woken at 5am -- an hour and a half before first light -- and would not go back to sleep.

I headed off with TG, Q and Sacha, going slowly up the hill, but joined Team KRT when they headed past so I could dump my pack contents with Dirt's grandfather.

The weather was perfect bluebird skies and the fall colours were the best we'd seen yet. Like Dirt's mother and new partner and cousin, her grandfather seemed nice too and we looked forward to meeting all her family over the next few days.

Within a few miles, some random hikers going the other way told me that TG and Q were ahead of us and we caught them up when we converged around a group of ponies who we plied with apples. We even found the long-horned cattle that had eluded us the day before.

We headed away once more and hiked another few miles, with Sweetblood carrying Sacha in the baby carrier to give Q a break. 

A feature called Fat Man's Squeeze could be easily navigated without even slowing down, which proved that the difficulties in the South are either waaaay easier than in New England or that ""fat man"" has a very different meaning to people in the South than elsewhere. (Both may have had some validity) 

Soon after this, Team KRT pushed on to lunch at Thomas Knob shelter while I stayed with TG and Q, who were heading back to their car via a short cut before then, as they had lunch at a series of idyllic grassy terraces among some pine trees.

This was even nicer when we discovered there was another group of ponies enjoying the terraces. After another lesson on what it's like to backpack while parenting -- in this case, learning that white tufts of toilet paper from previous LNT failures are like gold to inquisitive toddlers and thus demand constant vigilance -- I headed south and TG and Q headed home. 

It was definitely more relaxed hiking with them for a couple of days. It was hard to believe that 11 years had passed and I hope it won't be another 11 years before I see them again.

I caught up with Team KRT at the next shelter then took the side trail shortly afterwards to Mt Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia. 

The summit experience was less than exciting and I only realised I'd reached it because the trail suddenly ended in the middle of a forest and while looking for where it continued, I saw the trig point in a rock. But it was also the second last highest state peak we'd do on the AT, after previously tagging the highest points of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey. After here, there was just Clingman's Dome, the highest in Tennessee and the overall AT highest point, which is yet another sign that this epic journey is actually coming to an end.

After that we hauled along, aiming to meet Dirt's mother Scarlet. I was hiking alone at one point when the trail left a section of forest. There was yet another group on ponies sheltering just into the shade, which is where I discovered their predilection for licking hikers' sweat.

Perhaps because of this, I completely missed the AT's counterintuitive turn uphill and started following a different trail that headed straight ahead. I would have worked this out fairly quickly from spotting the blue blazes, but I was saved from getting as far as that by a random hiker I'd been chatting to on the trail shortly beforehand. He caught up as I was about to head in the wrong direction and he helpfully pointed out where the AT actually went. Thank you, random stranger!

This was the end of the highlands' pony zone, which helped us make fast time along a series of rolling hills and down to a parking lot where Scarlet and Ricky were waiting for us in two cars. After 40 minutes of driving along obscure back roads, we ascended a truly scary driveway to their home.

Now we're showered, dressed in clean clothes, sated with an enormous spaghetti dinner and kicking back with some craft beer.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The random hiker who saved me from a navigational snafu at the final group of ponies turned out to be only two degrees separated from me. I'd chatted to him briefly on the trail before the ponies and, after asking where I was from, said he'd spent quite a bit of time in New Zealand, including working in a private 3000 acre nature reserve on Banks Peninsula called Hinewai Reserve. I told him I'd been to the reserve and met the founder, Hugh, with whom he'd worked. Now we're one degree of separation apart.","Wilson's Creek shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583762,"Dirt has walked home.

That wouldn't usually be a matter of note, but when her walk started in Maine and involved around 1700 miles of far-from-easy trail to your home town in southern Virginia, it's an achievement that has a somewhat higher gravitas.

It helped that the final lap of this epic was an easy one: slackpacking on the Virginia Creeper rail trail to downtown Damascus.

This isn't strictly the AT, which mostly avoids the cruisy rail trail -- all downhill at an average grade of -1%! -- and instead, in classic AT fashion, heads into the hills for a series of PUDs that are so egregiously pointless that I'd dubbed them SPUDs: Seriously Pointless Ups and Downs.

We had a few miles of hiking before reaching the rail trail but it was all downhill and on fast trail, with the only impediments to forward progress being the necessity of stopping to take in the increasingly impressive fall colours of the forests we were hiking through.

After swapping Grayson's rock between us for nearly 400 miles, we left it with a note in the first shelter, asking whoever took it on to continue alerting him to its progress as it made its way towards Springer. I mentioned it on the Sobo AT fb page and several people volunteered to keep it heading southwards.

Everything changed when we hit the rail trail. Being a Saturday with nice weather near the peak of fall colours conspired to see what seemed like most of the population of Virginia biking along the trail. 

The AT followed the rail trail across a massive timber viaduct then headed back into the woods for the first of several SPUDs.

Our resident purists are Dirt and 2am, but she'd done the section from the Grayson Highlands to Damascus as a shake-down hike before heading to Maine and didn't feel the need to do it again. 

But Sriracha was feeling the need for purity and followed 2am on the AT while the rest of us wandered along the rail trail. We agreed to meet for lunch where the two paths intersected again. 

Near the rendezvous site we encountered a donation-based sausage sizzle being run as a fundraiser by Dirt's church and we lingered there for a while, including meeting Dirt's younger brothers Elijah and Harper and their dog Rosie, who were going to hike the rest of the way with us.

After sharing the path with a gazillion cyclists, we opted to take the AT after lunch so we'd get some peace and quiet. Mostly this paralleled the rail trail via a less easy path on the side of the hill but eventually we crossed another road and then the trail headed up and over the final SPUD between us and Damascus, four miles away. We opted for purity and took the AT.

Soon we reached the Damascus town sign and then we immediately went to the ice cream shop, where we found Happy Feet and OK in situ. Dirt's mother had left a car in town for her and we walked to that then headed back for another night of a huge meal, cocktails and cold beers.

Life is very good.

AT fact of the day: The proximity of the AT to the rail trail prompted some unwitting wild life encounters. Clearly most cyclists didn't know the most famous trail in the US was next to the Virginia Creeper trail and one had the misfortune to head what seemed to be an appropriate distance into the woods to attend to a call of nature, only to unwitting choose a site literally two feet from the AT. Elijah was in front at the time and stopped so the mystery cyclist wouldn't realise her mistake. As he said later: ""I saw a bare!"" ""A bear?"" others asked.

Just how blessed my walk in the southern AT has been was demonstrated by remembering the last few times it had rained, one of which was when we took a double zero at Sweetblood's grandfather's home and another was when we were in Charlotteville with Pepa as the tail end of Hurricane Irma soaked everything. That's ridiculously lucky.

But it's not like we were doing nothing in Damascus -- there was a Harry Potter marathon to play. The sobo demographic meant the others in Team KRT were the generation whose childhoods were intrinsically tied with JK Rowling's tales of the young wizard, whereas I had neither read the original books or even seen one of the movies. 

This double zero turned into a triple zero because Sriracha had come down with some kind of intestinal distress. After making a visit to a doctor's clinic in Abingdon, he was prescribed antibiotics and, although he didn't ask it, he was happy to accept the benefits of taking an extra day off to recuperate. The fact that it was also raining on our third zero-day was just the icing on the cake.

And in turn we met the southern superbubble he was hiking with, which included many of the people we'd hike with for the next month. There must be 30 sobos in town tonight. Crazy!","Damascus
",Damascus,"Oct 08, Sun",0
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583859,"""Only losers are still in Virginia!""

That was the greeting I received from Beast as I walked up to the signpost marking the border between Virginia and Tennessee. He was sitting with a dozen other members of the Sobo Mega Bubble -- Team KRT and his own mega-crew, dubbed The Second Breakfast Club -- just on the other side of the sign.

After about five weeks since I'd crossed into Virginia on the outskirts of Harpers Ferry, it was hard to argue with his observation. Although I also couldn't help enjoying the irony that they were all sitting on the uphill side of the trail and thus, because the trail at this point was heading a fraction south of due west, it meant they were probably all actually sitting in Virginia.

I opted to keep that point to myself and instead gratefully plonked down my pack next to all the others.

This wasn't the only ironic moment of the day and it wasn't even midday yet. After a couple of chilly days as the remnant of Hurricane Nate blew through, today was soul-sappingly warm and humid, meaning I was sweating buckets as I ground my way up the hill out of Damascus. 

The ironic aspect of this was that my pack was now weighed down with much more warm clothing. This included the extra layers TG and Q had brought me a few days before but also a sleeping bag thermal liner I'd bought from an outfitter in Damascus that morning and which, along with a lightweight bivy bag, I was hoping would allow my 40degF sleeping bag to cope with the expected temperatures over the next month. 

Based on the temperature right now, it seems like I'd have been OK just with the thermal liner and without needing the sleeping bag at all, but the more rational side of my brain insists that over the next month, we'll progressively swap from warm weather with a few chilly interludes to cold weather with a few mild respites.

A further irony came in the form of the ""triple zero curse"", where several days off from hiking has the counter-intuitive effect of making me feel less energised instead of being refreshed. Combined with the heat of the day, the outfitter stop and a couple of other town chores, I was definitely the last one out of town.

I was grateful that the trail for the rest of the day after meeting up at the border seemed to revert to the long, flat and forested ridgetops that had characterised most of our time since New England.

The Second Breakfast Club were aiming for two shelters hence, 18 miles from Damascus, but we were aiming for about three miles shy of that, at a camping site with a supposedly reliable piped spring.

When we reached the first shelter at Abingdon Gap for lunch, we discovered that Footprint and Simpleton, who we'd last seen at Woods Hole, hadn't got word of our extra zero-day and had hiked into this shelter last night with trail magic for us.

It was disappointing to have missed them but they'd hidden some of the treats -- beer, fruit and herbs -- for us to find, having provided the location as a riddle in the log book. Alas the cryptography was not of Enigma-style deviousness -- the riddle for the beer's location, for example, was ""Your mind is in the G______"" -- and had been worked out by those hiking ahead of us. All that was left by the time I got there were some sprigs of cilantro/coriander.

Of greater moment was discovering that earlier in the log book Omega, the nobo who exemplified himself for hiking just in his ""tighty whitey"" underwear, had recorded the moment when he realised that this was appropriate hiking couture. 

""Day 65 from AFSP [Amicalola Falls State Park], Day 64 from Springer Mountain. 

""The other guy in the shelter had a fire going, trying to dry his pants which got soaked in the rain. Last time I hiked in the rain, all that got wet were my socks boots and underwear so hiking in my tighty whiteys is fun AND practical! Works great for me. No pants forever!""

It sounded like it was a literal road-to-Damascus experience, although we wondered if this philosophy would work quite as well in the Presidential range...

The rest of the afternoon dragged by. Sriracha was still feeling drained from his intestinal distress of the previous few days and I wasn't going much better but without an excuse other than being old and decrepit.

I was grateful to find the roadside spring at our campsite was flowing slowly but steadily. I filled up a few litres then trudged up the hill to the campsite to cook. It's good to be back out in the woods again.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: The Second Breakfast Club seemed like a cool group and it was good to get to know the other members a little better than I had in our brief encounter at Crazy Larry's hostel in Damascus. It was today that I learned that two of them, Jay and Ash, had got engaged on the trail in Maine and were aiming to marry on Springer mountain on November 11, the day after they plan to finish the trail. That's about when we were aiming to finish too and they've made it clear they want every hiker in the vicinity to feel welcome both at the ceremony and the reception afterwards. This is shaping up as a truly epic way to finish our hike...","Damascus

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583902,"We're becoming accustomed to the AT in the South being rather more civilised than it had been in Maine and New Hampshire, but one section of trail today really drove the point home by being fully wheelchair accessible.

""This,"" I told the others, ""is what the PCT is like."". 

This was partly in jest, having endlessly tormented the other tramily members by comparing the suitable-for-horses grade of the PCT to the cruel-for-the-sake-of-being-cruel nature of the AT's tread, but it also had an element of truth to it. And as a section of gently graded gravel path wound through some farm pastures, it was easy to hike at PCT-style speeds.

To be fair, even before and after this short stretch of accessible trail, the trail had been both fast and easy.

Shortly after this wheelchair accessible section, we crossed Tennessee Route 91 but I miscounted how many streams we'd crossed and missed the chance to fill my water bottle, leaving me with half a litre to cover the three miles to the next reported source, a pooling spring described as unreliable.

Fortunately, that half litre proved to be sufficient and that spring was flowing enough to be a viable source but the one after that, for which we were aiming to fill our bottles to avoid a steep 0.5 mile side trail down a hill to a spring at our intended campsite, was absolutely bone dry. Water continues to be more problematic than before.
Soon after this I ran into Oh Yeah, a nobo thru-hiker who'd missed this section and was two miles away from completing his thru-hike at Tennessee Route 91 and was reflecting all the excitement one might expect. I'd also met a father and daughter pair (he was The Colonel but her name escapes me) who were also cleaning up a missed section to Damascus of their thru-hike.
The route after lunch was the familiar AT formula of long, flat and forested ridgelines, broken in one place by the memorial for a hermit who lived beside the trail. Like so many previously occupied places on the AT, there was no sign anyone had ever lived her but the memorial, presumably by a niece or nephew, marked that place where Nick Grindstaff ""lived alone, suffered alone and died alone"". 
I was suffering alone, but not in a manner comparable to Uncle Nick, and arrived at Vandeventer shelter to find the Second Breakfast Club in situ. It was a nice spot on top of a knoll, promising grandstand views of the sunset and sunrise, but I headed down the hill on a side trail to where they told me Team KRT was camped on a saddle halfway to the the shelter's spring. Of all the long and arduous treks to access water so far on the AT, this might set a new record.

But it was good to catch up with the others and soon I'd set my tent up and joined the others in a circle of culinary friendship.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Tennessee Route 91 also marked the point where Sriracha and Sweetblood had begun their southbound shakedown hike, months before they started from Katahdin. What was easy for us now with 1700 miles under our feet was not quite the same for them then, coming in fresh and (probably) carrying too much. Their tales of getting their trail legs while also coping in sub-freezing temperatures, where water froze inside their water bottles, sounded harrowing.","Low Gap, Tennessee
",Vaneventer shelter,"Oct 12, Thu",17.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583972,"To say that Bob Peoples is an AT legend is a bit like saying Donald Trump likes Twitter.

I'd heard about him for years for his trail work crews and for his trail advocacy, while his reputation on trail is such that we'd been finding Chuck Norris style graffiti about him in shelters miles before reaching his home turf in Tennessee.

Maybe the biggest tribute of all is that meeting this amiable, humble and gently spoken superstar of the trail was today's highlight despite spirited competition between some of the best (and worst) sections of trail yet, random and awesome trail magic and being offered freshly-cooked smores by the Second Breakfast Club.

And also despite the cat-pee smell. But more of that later.

We'd started the day down in our campsite watching the Second Breakfast Club head out early. They're not naturally early risers but halfway through today were aiming to resupply in Hampton, a town sited a few miles off trail, and that required an early start.

I don't have to go into town, although not for commendable reasons. Despite being on the tail end of my third thru-hike, I still haven't managed to master resupplying and one of the reasons why I was dragging my ass out of Damascus a couple of days ago was because it turned out I had five days of food for the nominally three-day section to Hampton. Considering I've got about 20,000km of hiking under my calloused feet, I still make rookie errors...

The start of the trail was easy as we followed the gradually descending ridgeline to the dam creating Watauga Lake.

After yesterday's unexpected encounters with three nobo thru-hikers on the verge of finishing the trail because they were coming back to complete a section they'd had to skip earlier, I met yet another today. 

Stitch had skipped this section because she didn't want to lose her tramily while recuperating from some kind of ephemeral injury and was back to do this section, leaving her with just one more to complete her hike. That section was through the Roanoke balds and she'd been deliberately been keeping it until last so she could share the experience with her mother.

Soon after that, I reached the road and found some hikers about to head into the woods. Their boots, heavy packs and cleanliness made them stand out from the thru-hiking fraternity but clearly that recognition isn't reciprocal because they asked me if I was a day hiker!

""Sort of,"" I replied, ""if you count 139 day hikes in a row.""

This was met by blank expressions, which suggested the reality still hadn't quite dawned on them.

The next section featured a series of warning signs about bears and the problem was sufficiently bad that the shelter in the middle of the section was closed for that reason and was slated for demolition.

I'd heard stories that this area was a last-chance saloon for problem bears from places like the Smokies and the Shenandoahs. Later I heard that one of a pair of female bears relocated to here had later taught her two cubs that humans carry the energy-dense food they crave and will abandon it when approached.

Whether there is any veracity to these stories, bears were the reason why the shelter was shut and we were warned not to stop in the four-mile stretch from the dam to Shook Branch picnic area. Supposedly it was closed entirely to anyone other than thru-hikers and LASHers.

We all regrouped at the picnic area, along with OK and Happy Feet and a bunch of the Second Breakfast Club who were about to head to town. We also met yet more previously unknown sobos, in the form of Rogue and BearScare. The latter's trail name came from his reportedly horrendous snoring scaring any bruin that might be tempted to make contact.

The next section featured the PUD that had -- reportedly -- been the inspiration for the term for the AT's Pointless Ups and Downs. This seemed to have some veracity because the map showed that instead of arcing across through a forested area on the northern face of a considerable mountain, it followed up one ridge, traversed below the summit and then headed all the way back down again on the neighbouring ridge. It really was pointless. 

Sriracha and Sweetblood, who had done this section already on their shakedown hike, could not find the enthusiasm to do it again -- and who could blame them? They decided to get lifts to skip ahead to Kincora Hostel, run by Bob Peoples. 

Such was their lack of knowledge of the AT back then that they'd never heard of Bob and it was just random that they chose his famous hostel as the place where a friend would pick them up after the hike. A few hours in his company back then had changed all that and they were looking forward to staying the night there this time. 

Better still, they were happy to take most of the contents of my pack with them so the PUD would be pointless but not (as) painful. 

And then, as we sat around in the sun, a guy came rocking up to us and asked if we wanted trail magic. It turned out to be Jim Gregory, the proprietor of Boots Off hostel, just a few minutes walk away, and soon after that he disappeared in his car and returned with a series of hot pizzas. 

We wandered up to the hostel to eat the pizzas. It looked like a great place and one we'd happily have enjoyed spending time in if it wasn't halfway through the day and with Bob's Kincora hostel only a few hours away.

With a much lighter pack, I headed up the Mother Of All PUDs and found it was indeed as pointless as pitched. But it was at least pleasantly graded and I made fast time back down to Laurel Creek, where many of those who'd hitched to Hampton had walked up the creek from town, avoiding the PUD entirely.

I met them as 14 of them were settling in around a fire. Dirt had been through about an hour earlier -- she was hiking ahead to meet a friend from university who lived nearby -- but 2am was still there, seduced by the Second Breakfast Club's exuberant atmosphere.

They'd brought up a prodigious amount of alcohol and were even plying everyone -- even passing hikers like me -- with smores cooked over the campfire.

And they are a fun group. In other situations I might have been tempted to take a short day but slackpacking meant I didn't have either a tent or sleeping bag, compelling me to make it to Kincora hostel that night.

The rest of the way was fun, taking the low route through a gorge that would be unfeasible in even the slightest rain, and then seeing Laurel Falls, which was the best we'd seen for some time. 

After a steep climb up some rock steps, the trail then followed an old railway bed, making it both fast and easy -- until a place where there was clearly once a trestle bridge that no longer existed. 

Even despite the subsequent descent to river level and back up the far side, I was grateful for the easy terrain for the second part of the day. I rocked up to Kincora hostel right on dark.

Bob Peoples was chatting amiably with Sriracha and Sweetblood on the porch and had been for four hours. I soon understood why when Bob started telling stories of his decades of supporting the trail and the 20,000-plus people who'd stayed at his hostel. To give just one example, the way he helped organise everyone at the ALDHA conference after the publication of A Walk In The Woods to wear ""Bill Bryson is a candy ass!"" shirts 
He'd bought the place specifically for its proximity to the trail and back in the days when thru-hikers only numbered a few hundred a year, Kincora hostel was a rare treat and a must-stay location. Now there is much more competition from the new wave of hostels, such as Boots Off.

I'd heard that the place had gone downhill since Bob's wife died several years back and that there were lots of cats stuck inside and three raccoons living under the sink. All that proved to be true and the acrid smell of cat pee when I entered the dorm room was initially overpowering. 

Bob was pretty sanguine about this -- ""It's $5 a night, so if they don't want to stay, they don't have to"" -- which I suspect meant he had become desensitised to the full extent of the smell. It says something about Bob's company that it was still worth staying here.

Life is good, albeit with a fairly strong ammonia smell...

AT fact of the day: Jim the hostel owner had the usual coterie of unusual staff hanging around the place -- AT hostels, we discovered, acted as a kind of lost dogs' home -- and one of these was Twisted, an older guy claiming to be a seven-times AT thru-hiker -- including having done the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia a dozen times -- and also a triple crowner. But something about his manner raised my BS-detection instincts honed by 35 years in journalism. Maybe he has done what he said he had but I suspect we've met the first example of an AT phenomenon: people who claim to be hikers but who are really just homeless exaggerators... Time will tell.","Vaneventer shelter
",Kincora hostel,"Oct 13, Fri",17.60
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584030,"We didn't have to wait long to have reason to thank Bob Peoples for his unstinting trail work. 

As soon as we left his hostel and wandered back to the AT, we faced a long and grinding climb back up to the latest long, flat and forested ridgetop. In the process of this, we could make out where the original AT went straight up the ridge in a way that brought back unpleasant memories of Maine. 

But we were inordinately grateful to see that original route was being revegetated and instead we walked up a series of pleasantly graded switchbacks that crossed over the original direct route.

That gratitude counterbalanced the pervading smell of cat pee that we carried with us after our night in the hostel. 

Sriracha and Sweetblood had opted for a bedroom because it had a door that might be able to keep the cats -- and the tomcat smell -- out. But about 15 minutes after going into the room, they found a cat on their bed, having found a way inside.

They'd said the mezzanine floor was even worse for cat pee smell and since I was gagging at the smell just in the kitchen, I opted not to even go up there. Instead, I slept on the couch as the least-wrost option.

Even after just one night, our reaction to the smell was more muted by the next morning, which might help explain Bob's lack of concern about the tomcat aroma. Maybe after a few years, you don't even notice it at all any more? 

It was something to ponder as we reached the ridgetop and began traversing along one side. For reasons not immediately obvious, we were all moving slowly this morning. Sweetblood was only one of the three of us who seemed to have some pep in her step. Dirt was somewhere ahead, aiming to spend time with a friend from university before rejoining us in two days, while 2am had opted for some alone time and camped about half a mile before Kincora. He was probably already ahead of us.
We hiked nine miles in to Hardcore cascades for lunch -- even here Bob's hand was present, since Hardcore was the name of his trail maintenance crew. We were there when the Second Breakfast Club mega-crew came through in a series of small groups. 

We followed them for the rest of the day, arriving at Mountaineer Falls shelter to find them already in situ, along with 2am who had been ahead of us all day. The shelter was one of the nicest ones on trail but it already seemed pretty full so after cooking dinner, we opted to camp on the ridge above.

Today was a pretty modest day with one big climb in the morning and mostly just traversing after that. Not sure why I'm so tired, but tomorrow we're meeting one of Sriracha's college friends to stay at his aunt's mountain house so we'll have a nero in which to recuperate.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: As befits the sobo demographic, where most of those on the trail southbound are new college grads because graduation is too late for a northbound hike, most of the members of the Second Breakfast Club are in their early twenties. Beast came up to me today as his crew soared past and complained about everyone in his crew being younger than him and how he struggled to match them for pace and endurance. And he's 32 -- just over half my age. I told him I understood!","Kincora hostel
",Mountaineer Falls shelter,"Oct 14, Sat",17
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584089,"A day of fewer than nine miles would not normally require an early start but we're meeting Brian, Sriracha's university room mate, at lunchtime today to be taken to his aunt's mountain house for some time off trail.

This was further exacerbated for me personally because I walk more slowly than my much younger companions, who have not yet worn out their joints through mountaineering, Telemark skiing and adventure racing. 

All this meant I left the campsite at 8.10am, while the others were still packing up, and enjoyed easy, quiet trail going gently downhill to a river. The trail followed this upstream until the trail headed steeply up a tributary valley.

Midway up this tributary was Jones Falls, which was 0.1 miles away along a side trail, but the trail marker acted as an impromptu Yelp! review by being graffitied with admonitions such as ""Worth it! GO!"", ""Epic!"", ""You are a fool if you miss this"", ""0.1 miles. Worth it!"" and ""Awesome"".

And it was indeed worth the side trip to see it.

Soon after that the trail went from forests into more rural terrain, including going past an old cemetery and through pastures that looked semi-abandoned and seemed to be regenerating back to native bush. This regeneration process is what I'd expected of large sections of the AT, only to learn that regeneration has either gone on for long enough to create mature forest cover or for it to be relatively recent.

After that it was easy terrain down to the road, where we found Rob, a trail angel who used to run a hostel in Massachusetts but now did trail magic at random moments for nobos and then sobos. 

He was a military veteran who stood out for having a mohawk and also a white van emblazoned with an image of the cartoon of Casper the friendly ghost on the side above the slogan ""The friendly AT van."" 

Combined with a couch in the back which he used to ferry hikers around, it was a mix of attributes that would have screamed out dodgy child abductor in any other situation but it says something about the culture of the AT that this was just normal. 

Most of the Second Breakfast Club were present and being ferried into town by Rob to resupply before heading on to the next shelter. A hint that this next section over the Roanoke balds was going to be a highlight came in the form of the large number of day and weekend hikers emerging from the mountains to the south.

Brian arrived soon after and we were driven into North Carolina to stock up on food (for the next section) and beer (for tonight), hit up a southern barbecue restaurant for lunch and then drove to the home of his aunt, Missy. Her home was in an upscale mountain community and was both welcoming and eclectically furnished and decorated, as one might expect of an opera set designer who splits her time between here and New Mexico.

Brian's sister had thru-hiked the previous year and stayed here too, so Missy knew what to expect and that's why we were shuttled into the showers and then quickly had the washing machine decontaminating our clothing.

Our luck with the weather has continued too. We're doing a double nero, with an early finish today and a late start tomorrow, which combines almost perfectly with a short burst of rain coming through. I'm sure we'll be on the wrong end of this cycle eventually but for the time being... life is good!

AT fact of the day: In the supermarket we found a brand of beer made by the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company, so of course we had to buy some. And now we've found that it's brewed in Franklin, an AT trail town we'll be able to visit in a few weeks. WIN!","Mountaineer Falls shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584185,"""So, North Carolina,"" I said, trying to conjure up the voice of a James Bond villain. ""We meet again.""

Nobody was there to hear me but I'd been waiting for this moment for more than four months. And, in a sense, I'd actually waited for it for 53 years.

Back in 1964, when I was two years old, my parents took me and my three older siblings on a seventh-month around the world trip while my father took a research sabbatical from his job. 

I remember none of this, unsurprisingly, and the only lasting impact it had on me was that in Raleigh, North Carolina, I was jumping up and down on a bed and managed to swan-dive into the bedhead, leading to an anxious moments for my mother, who had to spend the night waking me every hour to see if my pupils were dilating as a way of assessing potential brain damage.

I still have the scar.

But for 53 years, North Carolina and I have coexisted without crossing paths. Until today, when after a long and steady climb I reached Doll Flats, a campsite straddling the ridge and featuring a sign that showed that this was the watershed that formed the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. 

Fortunately there were no beds to jump on or fall off. I suspected falling off my Thermarest at camp later wouldn't have the same effect as on that fateful day in 1964.

The strenuous 2800ft climb was almost welcome because the storm front that had delivered rain overnght and into this morning had also brought with it another blast of chilled air. Fortunately the overnight rain eased off while we were being driven back to the trail by Brian, picking up Dirt along the way, but this was a cold-ass day of a kind that I suspect is going to become the norm.

If I thought it was cold on the climb up through the forest from the highway, a helpful recalibration was provided by emerging from the treeline soon after. The strongest winds we'd encountered so far on the trip added windchill to the already cold temperatures and the high humidity meant it felt even colder. 

Cold-but-damp is an awkward combination to dress for but it's also the default weather in New Zealand so it was a familiar challenge. Everyone I met was rugged up in rain jackets but I opted for a windstopper fleece vest and a strategy of not stopping, and it worked perfectly.

It helped that this was some of the most scenic trail in a very long time, despite the distinctly less-than-poetic name of Big Hump mountain. From the top, we could see that our progress would be mostly along balds, with occasional patches of forest in between. Nice trail has always had an effect of adding an extra gear to my performance and that was the case here.
Having magnificent views in all directions certainly added a sense of enjoyment to the process and more than compensated for the lack of shelter from the freezing gales. It also showed how viewless so much of the AT has been since New Hampshire.

The goal was Overmountain shelter, an old barn made available to hikers and in a spectacularly beautiful site nestled in a sheltered corner of the range.

This is likely to be our coldest night yet, which ought to be the first real test of the thermal liner and bivy bag I've been carrying since Damascus. It was so cold, I immediately jumped into my sleeping bag and am cooking from that. 

OK and Happy Feet were already here and over the course of the next hour the rest of Team KRT rocked up to the barn too.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: You can tell this is home turf for southern Virginia native Dirt, who spent last night with a college friend and has arranged to meet another friend tomorrow and then yet others the night after. And when she arrived at the barn today, she realised she knew one of the section hikers present. The South is a small world...","Missy's mountain house
",Overmountain shelter,"Oct 16, Mon",9.20
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584233,"Cold does not really capture the nature of last night. It was not just cold but BONE-ASS cold.
But my new enhanced sleep system passed the test... just. And since I still had an extra component -- I could have put up my tent and got inside that -- that I didn't need to deploy, I declared this a success. 
It had been tempting to sleep inside the barn on its mezzanine floor, which would have still been a fairly draughty affair because of gaps in the weatherboards, but having done so would have deprived me of the corresponding benefit of getting the sun first thing when it rose.
We were already aware of the warming power of sunlight when the sun crept over the horizon and instantly warmed us as we sat in our sleeping bags, but just in case there was any shred of doubt, the frost on the roof was immediately melted and turned into a 10-minute deluge of drips from the side of the barn facing east. I'd never experienced anything like it.
It still took a while to motivate ourselves to hike out, although the reward for doing so was to find that Bob Peoples had arrived to lead a trail crew here. They'd parked their cars outside the barn and were heading to the next shelter to do some remedial work.
Although we didn't need any further proof about the overnight temperatures, the substantial frost feathers on the trailside vegetation provided a photogenic way to show just how cold it had been. Once again, the prospect of climbing a hill out of camp offered the appealing aspect of warming us up.
Dirt went ahead early because she was meeting a college friend, Carlie, at the next bald. By the time we got there, the day had warmed up considerably, with clear blue skies and not a breath of wind, let alone the gales of yesterday. We enjoyed the chance to laze around in the sun with a gazillion day hikers who'd come up a mile from the road nearby.
We followed their path down to the road crossing then climbed up the hill beyond to Roanoke High Point, the site of the highest shelter on the AT -- a repurposed fire tower cabin, and thankfully fully enclosed rather than three-sided -- and the first time the trail had been over 6000ft since the Presidential range way back in New Hampshire. 
It seemed like the Second Breakfast Club had got to here the previous day and their entries in the hut register made it clear how cold, wet and miserable their day had been. By leaving at lunchtime from Missy's home, it was just we had definitely dodged a bullet and the thought of tackling last night's temperatures with wet gear did not bear thinking about for long.
The far side of Roan High Knob was another place where Bob Peoples was famous for his input. Nobos once knew of this as the ""Roan groan"" because the trail went straight up the ridge for a few thousand feet but now there were dozens of switchbacks, for which my knees were very grateful.
In the process of this descent, I ran into a couple of apparent day hikers, Rambo and Flicker, who turned out to be sobo thru-hikers who'd changed their hike after 700 conventional miles and were doing self car support with two cars, allowing them to do 30-mile days with day packs. 
They were pretty much sick of the trail -- 30-mile days have that effect -- but they were also aiming to be done in 12 days. Twelve days! Better them than me -- I was happy we were aiming for a daily mileage of only a little over 14 miles to finish on November 11. 
Then later, I met another thru-hiker, a nobo flip flopper called F-stop, who was aiming to get to her starting point near Harpers Ferry before the winter weather really kicked in.
All this took us down to the Hughes Gap road and then a grinding ascent up to Clyde Smith shelter for the night. 
We were concerned to see a lost and clearly starving hunting dog at the camp, and even less happy to find out that the others had seen it roll in human shit in the middle of the camping area. (Thanks, privy-less Tennessee AT shelters!)
Team KRT is a very animal friendly group but the dog was shunned, albeit with an explanation about the reason... It blotted its copybook even further when it followed a hiker down to a spring, where it then rolled in the water source.
There was another flip flopper there, an older guy called Vietnam Vet, who said he intended to look after the dog and make sure it returned to its owner. Later Goldilocks and Gnome, two sobo thru-hikers who'd been part of the mega sobo bubble in Damascus, rocked up to complete the crew at the shelter. 
We're at the same altitude as our shelter last night but the weather is much warmer, for which we are very grateful.
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: Dirt had hung back at the bald to chat to her friend for as long as possible, but this came at a cost when she was caught by dusk as she hiked the last few miles to camp. We'd started the habit of leaving a hiking pole, buff or cap to mark turnoffs so that those behind know we've gone off trail, but someone inadvertently brought in 2am's pole so she didn't have that hint.

It was little surprise they were looking second best when they packed up and we deferred our departure until 10am to see how they were faring.
2am went ahead but we found him less than a mile later, lying on the ground and clearly not doing well. Sweetblood was doing about as well as could be expected, but that was markedly short of doing well. 
Fortunately, there was an AT hostel down a side trail less than two miles from our shelter. Greasy Creek Friendly was as famous for being a nice place to stay as it was for the occupant of the neighbouring house, who had a habit of verbally abusing any hikers that went past. 
(If his house, the only other one in the hamlet, wasn't nicknamed Greasy Creek Unfriendly, I will be very disappointed.)
By the time we reached the turnoff, it was clear that neither 2am or Sweetblood would be able to continue so they headed down to the hostel, along with Sriracha who was wondering how he'd managed to dodge this particular bullet. Dirt and I continued on, agreeing to meet again in Erwin, the town 30 trail miles ahead.
Today's hike, after our recent reminder of the benefits of hiking on balds, was a reversion to the usual long, forested and viewless ridgelines to which we'd become so accustomed. The main upside was at least it meant we made good miles.
This was despite a grunty ascent of Unaka mountain, the reward for which came near the top of the mountain in the form of a mossy enchanted forest which was some of the nicest woodland we'd seen this side of New England. 
Just the other side, we hiked through a stand of pine trees and found one decorated like a Christmas tree. Closer examination showed it had a more sombre story, serving as a memorial to a local young man who'd died aged barely 22.
Usually this would be most likely be either a road crash or a suicide, but with the opioid epidemic afflicting much of the territory the AT went through, it seemed equally likely that that might have been the cause of his premature demise. 
From here, we headed down to a spring, where we stocked up with water for tonight's camp at a place called Beauty Spot. In the process, we found two sobo section hikers present. Morocco Mule and Denim were very very familiar names for weeks in the shelter registers so it was odd to finally meet them. Such is the monodirectional nature of trail communication, of course they had never heard of any of the members of Team KRT.
An hour further on we reached the next bald, which went by the entirely accurate moniker of Beauty Spot. We found Happy Feet and OK in a campsite with room for two more.
Dirt's friends had both cancelled while we were hiking -- it was a midweek night and they worked day jobs, so it wasn't wholly surprising -- but such was the awesomeness of the views of the sunset over the mountains ahead, we were happy to have made the effort to get here.
And tonight, I'm using my bivy bag in an attempt to do my first successful cowboy camp on the AT...
Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584361,"Miss Janet is one of the names synonymous with the AT.

Partly this was from her running a famous hostel in Erwin, Tennessee, for years. After closing the hostel about 10 years ago, she swapped to doing mobile trail magic by using a minivan to follow the nobo herd from Georgia to Maine and then, once most of the nobos are done, would head south to do the same for the sobo herd en route to Springer.

And a significant part of this notoriety is that she's one of the trail's true characters and even though she's never done much more than a few short hikes, she serves as an example of how the AT's longer history has resulted in a different social ecosystem that had developed around it.

She is, in short, a trail tragic.

That's not meant pejoratively. And when Dirt announced today that she's lined us up to stay with Miss Janet at her house tonight in Erwin, I was inestimably grateful because my philosophy about this trail has been that I've wanted to experience every facet of the hike and that includes meeting as many of its characters as I could.

Dirt had initially called Rob, the mohawked trail magician with the dodgy-in-any-other-circumstances white van we'd met a few days earlier. But the decision of the Second Breakfast Club to slackpack back to Erwin tonight meant he was full and he offered Miss Janet as an option instead. 

Between us and our rendezvous with Miss Janet was 11 trail miles. 

I'd managed to successfully cowboy camp last night for the first occasion on the whole AT. (And since I'm writing this months after finishing the trail, I can also state this was the only successful occasion in more than five months)

It helped that the temperatures were warmer than Overmountain shelter and I didn't even need to use my sleeping bag liner. The katabatic effect meant there wasn't any frost on the ground around our hilltop camp but there was once we'd descended a few hundred metres.

Usually our delayed departure in the mornings in caused by cold-weather inertia but today it was also caused by the awesome view from our campsite across a fog-filled valley towards Mt Mitchell. At 2037m/6684ft, this was the highest peak not just in North Carolina but in the whole of the Appalachians, although the AT circles around it rather than going over it.

The trail was mostly downhill and fast, with lots of water available in the second half. By lunchtime, we arrived at the meeting space where Miss Janet was dutifully waiting. 

It turned out that she no longer had a home in Erwin but her uncle's home in the town was caught up in some kind of will-dispute with the wider family and she was able to use it while that was grinding its way through the courts. That's where we were staying.

Most of the Second Breakfast Club were slackpacking back to Erwin from either Spivey Gap (11 miles) or Sam's Gap (24 miles) but two other sort-of sobos, Buck and Rogue, were there. Like quite a few other people we'd met, they'd abandoned the idea of a pure hike and were mostly yellow-blazing around.

Miss Janet was kind enough to drive us to Walmart to resupply and also to get the supplies make a huge communal meal for everyone that night. We then went to possibly the worst Mexican restaurant I'd ever been to -- given its location right next to the Walmart, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised.

After that, there were the familiar chores of any town day: showers and laundry and repacking.

Once everyone was back, the house was full of hikers and as boistrous as one would imagine. The other groups are fun but they also tend to suck all the air out of the room and after more than four months in the hills, my capacity for big noisy crowds has certainly diminished. I escaped early and hid in the back room where Dirt, OK and Happy Feet are also camping.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We thought we ought to send a message to our sick colleagues, showing them we were thinking about them. For reasons that are not immediately obvious, this turned into sending a photo of OK drinking an enormous frozen margarita, albeit with tears added in post-production to say we were sad they weren't here with us...","Beauty Spot

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584428,"One of the quirks of the trail is how you can not see someone for months and then they appear around the next corner. 
That's how it was today, when we encountered Boss and Sweets plugging their way up the hill out of Erwin. I hadn't seen them since, I think, the Wildcats at the northern end of the White Mountains, which was less than a month after leaving Katahdin.
We might never have encountered them if we hadn't opted to take up Miss Janet's kind offer to let us slackpack today, which meant we were dropped at Spivey Gap and hiked northbound for the 11 mostly-downhill miles back to Erwin. 
They said they were aiming to finish on November 12, the day after us, which meant that we might never have seen them since they were hiking at almost exactly the same pace as us but a day behind.
This was an unexpected benefit because the slackpack option was primarily to give Sweetblood an easier day while she recovered from the norovirus-like illness she'd been afflicted by a few days earlier. This was also why she spent much of today hiking in a false nose and glasses because, as Miss Janet put it, ""nobody can be unhappy wearing a false nose and glasses because anyone walking towards you will smile at you when they see it"".
We'd been at Miss Janet's house that morning when we got word that Sweetblood, Sriracha and 2am had camped less than five miles out and would be in town by 10am. Once they'd been collected, there was some inevitable faffing around before we got to the trail but none of us were complaining.
First we went to Pal's, the most awesome drive-thru diner I'd seen yet in the US -- and this is a country well known for its drive thrus and its diners. How awesome? It's across the road from a Bojangles but Sriracha and Sweetblood were happy for us to go to Pal's and not Bojangles. (Cue: sound of head exploding)
There was further awesome faffing when Miss Janet drove the scenic back roads past farms owned by her extended family on the way up Spivey Pass, including to a hidden waterfall. 
And even once we reached the gap, there was another delay to take a photo. Miss Janet and I were talking about a mutual friend, PCT trail angel Terrie Anderson, who has the habit of mooning everyone as they pose for their photo outside their house in southern California. It seemed only right that we should get a photo of all of us mooning and send it to her. 
Once we finally got going, we ran into Teatime, who said he was supposed to have met his family in Erwin but they'd cancelled on him. This left him absolutely flat broke and after trying to find some kind of casual work in Erwin, he'd opted to hike to Hot Springs, the next town, and try his luck there. 
He really was absolutely broke, with barely enough food to make it. But he also explained that he was at that very moment stoned out of his gourd on pot. This was a recurring theme for supposedly broke hikers who exploited trail angels or skipped out without paying -- they always seemed to have money for pot.
This in turn took us to No Business Knob shelter. Miss Janet had explained the origin of the name, which offered final conclusive proof that we are in the South: the land all around was owned by one extended clan and this mountain was used to distil moonshine and unless you were family, you had ""no business"" being there.
The rest of the day involved a long descent back down to Erwin, which is where we met Boss and Sweets, who were hiking with Bangles, who I hadn't previously met. About an hour after that, we walked back to our rendezvous with Miss Janet.
We'd dwardled because we only had 11 miles to do but Happy Feet had opted to slackpack from Sam's Gap, 24 miles out, and she showed how much she could throw down by arriving only 20 minutes after us. That girl is fast!
There's only about five or six of us at Miss Janet's tonight, which makes for a less overwhelming atmosphere and allowed us to get to know her a little better. As befits someone who's been in the hiking community as long as she has, she has a LOT of stories that ranged from funny to sad to strange to disturbing -- and sometimes all those at the same time. 
We headed to the neighbouring town of Johnson City for an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet and also to find a bank where my ATM card would work. (Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank doesn't work everywhere -- who knew?!)
And then we dropped in to Walmart once more so Sriracha and Sweetblood could resupply and discovered that Halloween costumes were now on sale. On the CDT in 2010, we'd finished on November 1 so five of us had hiked the final 60 miles in Halloween costumes and even managed to trick or treat for beer at a trailside farm.
We're going to be on the trail for Halloween this year too... I think it has to happen!
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: Some of the Second Breakfast Club had opted to bail at Spivey Gap after 13 miles because of knee pain and not do the next 11 miles into town. I asked one of them if they were aiming to come back and do the missing miles later and he looked at me, paused meaningfully and said: ""Those miles... they are with god now.""","Erwin, Tennessee
","Erwin, Tennessee","Oct 20, Fri",11.10
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584491,"Our hiking buddy 2am is usually the first one to get a little antsy at Team KRT's well-established leisurely approach to getting the miles in. 

Part of the reason might be because his family has booked their flights to see him finish on Springer on Saturday November 11 and have booked their flights -- and, more importantly, his -- back to New York state the next day. He has to do the 187 trail miles by then.

Even though we have nearly three weeks to cover this ground, there's only one more zero day planned in that time and after his recent bout of norovirus-like illness, he might be thinking the margin for incapacity is a little tight. And as a newly minted engineer, he is also a little Type A in his approach to life.

All this explained why he headed on from Sam's Pass today while the rest of us lazed around in the sunshine, reclining on the grass. We not only said we'd follow but even asked him to get a fire going for us at the campsite just before Devil's Fork Gap. 

And we meant it... at the time. But then the trail magic beer arrived...

However that's getting ahead of ourselves. That morning as Miss Janet drove us back to Spivey Gap, we'd stopped at Bojangles to get breakfast. This is in itself a hint that Sweetblood had fully recovered from her intestinal distress.

But since Miss Janet is driving Happy Feet on to Sam's Gap, 13 miles trail miles further than our drop-off, it didn't take a lot of persuading for her conclude that an easy day would be beneficial to her recovery. 

It is true that I might have deliberately planted the seed of this idea in her head, motivated by the chance to slackpack between one and the other. And since water seems a little sketchy on this section, it meant we could stockpile a few gallons there so we could top up as we came through.

This plan worked a treat. Miss Janet decided to take Happy Feet and Sweetblood on a secret women's business roadie from Spivey to Sam's Gap and Sriracha, OK and I avoided carrying four days of food up a big-ass climb from the road. 

As has been the default in the South, the trail remained pretty good and generally well graded but it certainly hurt less to haul up the mountain with just a light pack, even though we're now ferociously fit. 

We headed over Little Bald, which wasn't actually a bald, and then made our way up to Big Bald, which was. In keeping with the Appalachians' trait as a bird migration corridor, we started hitting bird watching stations and mist nets monitored by ornithologists. 

After emerging from the tree line and just before the final climb up to Big Bald, we met a group of experts who were inspecting, cataloguing and releasing the captured birds. It was definitely worth stopping for a quarter of an hour to watch them in action, along with the throngs of day hikers out for a Sunday stroll on a gorgeous day.

And once we were on Big Bald -- clearly named by a team of creative poets -- we sat and lazed around in the sun, with no apparent rush to head on. I'd brought two Bojangles cajun chicken biscuits for lunch, so I was a happy hiker. 

In time we headed to Sam's Gap and had a pleasant reunion with Happy Feet and Sweetblood there -- they'd also been enjoying a lazy morning in the sun -- but we were rather less enthused by the idea of shouldering our full packs again.

So we procrastinated yet further and that's when 2am, who eschews slackpacking and had carried his pack the entire way that morning, opted to head on. 

And that's when one of the day hikers came up and asked us if we wanted anything. This was Stretch, a LASHer who'd done big chunks of the AT and who had moved to Asheville as a treechanger. He'd been out doing sketches of the trail for the latest in a series of books of trail sketches -- hence the name -- and it only took a few minutes to realise that we'd seen one of his previous books at Rock and Sole Hostel back in Pennsylvania. The world is very small. 
You can read about his book here: http://www.blurb.com/b/6235335...
""Are you sure you don't want anything?"" he asked.

We said we already had plenty of water, thanks to the stocks Happy Feet and Sweetblood had brought here.

""I've got beer...""

And that's why we didn't leave for another hour. And when we did, we'd happily volunteered to make our packs even heavier by carrying a few cans of beer. Sweetblood and I even carried one each for 2am because we felt sorry that he'd missed out.

A few hours later, we were chasing darkness and opted to stop at a ridgetop campsite about two miles short of where we'd agreed to meet 2am. For what it's worth, we actually felt bad when we reluctantly drank his beers since it was unlikely we'd catch him before Hot Springs. 

And then about an hour after dark, Dirt got a text from him: ""Guess I'll let the fire go out...""

Sorry, 2am!

AT fact of the day: The mathematical landmarks are starting to fly by now. It took an age to do 10% of the trail back in Maine but since then we've ticked off the one-quarter, halfway and three-quarter marks. Simple math suggests that the four-fifths mark happened even sooner and the six-sevenths mark -- which is pretty much exactly where we're camped right now -- was even sooner again. We were talking about how on our final day we'll mark the 2188-2189ths mark a mile before Springer Mountain, having crossed 2187-2188ths mark shortly before. It's what happens when you have a newly graduated math/stats major in your tramily but it's another sign that this epic hike is drawing to an end. Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584546,"One of the disquieting aspects of hiking the AT at this time of year has been the number of lost and starving hunting dogs we've encountered.
Pan had found one such radio-collared dog incapable of walking and carried it to the nearest road, where he heard from locals that the owners of the dog were renown for not treating their dogs well.
Only a few days ago, Vietnam Vet had found a starving dog -- and, we suspect, the source of the illness that wiped out 2am and Sweetblood -- and opted to wait with it at a shelter until its owner arrived. 
Now it's our turn. As we headed over a bald towards Jerry's Cabin shelter, we encountered a very young and also very very skinny dog with a radio-tracking collar on its neck. From its yelps, it was clearly not in a good way and the shelter register made it clear it had been hanging around here for days.
Sriracha's phone uses Verizon so he was able to call the owners, who claimed it had been missing for a couple of days. That didn't really match with what we were seeing but whatever. 
Then because it was in such poor condition, Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt ended up carrying it for six miles -- SIX MILES -- to rendezvous with its owners.
This is in keeping with this trio. I'd already heard plenty of stories about how their home in North Carolina was a menagerie of rescued animals and the only thing that surprised me so far was they hadn't yet adopted an animal on this trip.
It was clear they were tempted with this one, though, since there were lots of factual holes in the owners' story.
We hadn't expected this when we left Six-Sevenths camp this morning. Usually ridgetop campsites are comfortable but something about this one seemed to channel the wind all night. As soon as we left camp, the buffeting stopped and we walked past a bunch of beautiful campsites, including one with a killer view of the sunrise.
And then we descended to Devil's Fork Gap and went past the camp where 2am must have stayed and felt a pang of guilt about that...
There's some bad weather coming so we're hauling miles to get to a shelter to hunker down. I'd been extolling the virtues of a shelter zero -- a zero day in a shelter -- and depending on what it's like tomorrow, that might be what happens.
In the meantime, we had to content ourselves by having lunch on a spectacular outcrop called Big Butt Mountain. It was a great spot to eat. I cannot lie. You other guys cannot deny.
It was after that we encountered the lost dog on our way to Jerry Cabin shelter. I'd been tempted to stop here for the night since the shelter had a fireplace inside, which would have been great for a shelter zero, but we thought it would be wiser to cross Firescald Mountain -- a supposed difficult section of trail, or so supposed uber-hiker Twisted had told us -- while it was still dry and sunny.
I'll admit to a bit of apprehension about Firescald Mountain, which had the old AT as a low level route that bypassed the difficulties. As we got to where the old and new ATs split, there were dire wanrings about how difficult it was graffitied on the signpost.
And I don't think anything has ever been so overhyped. ""Unending rock scrambling!"" was one such claim but the sobo translation of these nobo claims was: ""slightly rocky trail"". 
I think on the entire thing, I used my hands once -- a far cry from the difficulties of something like the Mahoosucs, when I'd had to use all my bouldering skills to find a way through.
Soon after that we completed the final few miles to Little Laurel shelter, where there was just one other person present -- a sobo we'd been following for months, named Turtle Trax -- which meant there was plenty of room for us in the shelter.
There's a slow but adequate spring nearby which has allowed us to fill with water using the last of the light. Something tells me water won't be an issue tomorrow!
About half an hour after full dark, Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt arrived and told us how they'd had to carry the ailing dog for six miles. But they were also beaming from having had the chance to do something good, which says all you need to know about this trio.
Now we're all settled in the shelter. 
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: I'm calling bullshit on Twisted, the self-declared seven-times AT thru-hiker and triple crowner. He'd said the toughest part of the entire trail was Firescald mountain, which seemed a little far fetched after what we'd been through in Maine. But we also hadn't yet been there and gave him the benefit of the doubt, even though his boastfulness and lack of modesty automatically made me suspicious of his claims. Having now done Firescald mountain, it'd be one of the easiest days in Maine! It's weird but it seems like he's yet another example of people on the southern AT who claim to be things they're not, like the stolen valour of fake military veterans...","Six-sevenths camp
",Little Laurel shelter,"Oct 22, Sun",20.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584632,"Throughout the day, a series of cold and sodden hikers dropped in to the shelter, looked wistfully at us sitting around dry and comfortable in our sleeping bags and then headed back out into the maelstrom before the lack of exertion meant they cooled down so much they started shivering.

The first of these were Boss, Sweets and Bangles, followed later by Morocco Mole and then Halfway, the latter of whom announced we were ""the only sensible people I've met all day"". All of them were heading to a hostel about three trail miles ahead.

Just how bad was the weather? Heavy rain combined with gale-force winds to make life truly miserable for those outside -- it was one of those days when it's utterly impossible to stay dry, no matter what one's gear. We had a hint of this when the occasional gust sent rain all the way in to the point where it hit the back wall of the shelter, which would have to be 13ft/4m under the eave of the shelter. 

Seriously, it was that bad. Just to stay dry, I had to get out my bivy bag and put my sleeping bag inside that. The others brought out their tent flies and sheltered under those.
But notwithstanding the occasional blast of rain hitting the back wall, we were pretty chipper. It helped, of course, that we had plenty of examples from the other sobos of what it'd be like to be out there with them in the storm. 

I've always been a fan of on-trail zeros and have proselytised them to everyone who was prepared to listen -- and probably quite a few who weren't.

On the PCT, Three Gallon and I had festered at Thousand Island Lake in the Sierra, thanks to still feeling knackered from crossing from Kennedy Meadows to VVR in one epic-12 day stretch in a very big snow year and because, as part of being traumatised by weight loss from that section, we'd unwittingly headed out from Mammoth Lakes with four days of food for the nominally two-day stretch to Tuolumne. 

On the CDT, we'd added an extra day of food to our packs for our seven-day crossing of the Wind River Range in Wyoming so we could fester at Cirque of the Towers. Admittedly this was a bit of a bunk since our arrival coincided with a blast of cold wintery air that sent us huddling into our sleeping bags instead of using the spare time to explore the cirque and swim in the alpine lakes.

But the key factor compared to doing a zero day in town is that there was NOTHING to do, even if we wanted to. In town, we'd have gone to a series of restaurants, done our laundry, resupplied for the next leg and utilised WiFi to catch up with communications with the outside world.

An on-trail zero here avoided all that, except that being the AT, we had five bars of mobile phone coverage so we spent the time catching up with episodes of The New Girl, streamed on someone's smartphone, as well as less tech-dependent diversions such as a convoluted drinking game based on the whiskey I'd carried from Erwin.

The rain eased off and was replaced with blue skies by 3pm, at which point Sriracha, Sweetblood and Dirt -- succumbing to a sense of cabin fever -- opted to hike on. Happy Feet, OK and I opted to stay, which is how I ended up being introduced to the anarchic, left-field and downright weird fun that is Rick and Morty, a cartoon series that truly defied description. 

The rain returned later on but we were still warm and comfortable in the shelter and very happy with our decision.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: As if we didn't need validation for our shelter zero, Morocco Mule provided it when he explained how his phone, wrapped in a plastic bag inside a dry bag, had got soaked during his hike from Jerry's Cabin to our shelter. The weather really was that bad.","Little Laurel shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584731,"""Don't take the shortcut trail.""

""Don't come down Roundhouse Ridge trail.""

""I'm seriously not kidding.""

These were the series of messages I received from Sweetblood's crew, who'd gone ahead on the path of the old AT, which was four miles shorter than the current trail but was reputed to be a little overgrown. As they'd headed off, they said they'd let us know what it was like and whether it was worth doing.

And she did indeed let me know via a series of messages at the time -- but which I received only AFTER I'd completed the shortcut trail and walked into Hot Springs.

Such are the perils of failing to follow the white blazes that mark the official AT, which is why hiking this trail is called whiteblazing. This in turn has led to a series of related terms: blueblazing for following non-official routes that are marked in blue; yellowblazing for using roads to bypass sections of trail; and even pinkblazing for opting to, um, pursue romantic options in the form of another hiker.

In this tradition and because the AT had once gone this way, we'd dubbed today's route as retroblazing, which made us all feel better about shortcutting.

Considering the strength of yesterday's tempest, today dawned with calm blue skies as if nothing had ever happened. Only the number of branches and leaves covering the trail ahead provided corroboration. 

An hour or so after I left the shelter, I reached Log Cabin Road just as some of those we'd seen yesterday -- Halfway, Turtle Trax and a couple of section hiking women -- were hiking back up from Hemlock Hollow hostel. 

Given that they'd soaked themselves in yesterday's storm and had to spend money to get dry again, our decision to take a shelter zero was looking pretty good. That impression was bolstered when they gave a very lukewarm verdict on the dilapidated hostel, with lots of things in poor repair but with the key parts -- the ability to get warm and dry again -- functioning properly.

We had a short standoff as I prompted the others to head on because, having become accustomed to always being the slowest member of Team KRT, it took a while to realise that of the five of us standing there, the other four were even slower than me.

After a couple of grunty climbs -- the Carolinas Mountain Club didn't seem to believe in switchbacks -- I reached the shelter and then followed the trail as it undulated along a ridgeline towards a fire tower. Just as I started the final climb, I encountered a young guy with a truly enormous backpack stuffed to overflowing and who was carrying even more stuff in a bag in his left hand and then his sleeping bag in his right. It was quite a sight.
He explained how he'd got completely soaked yesterday and was out on the trail because he'd just quit university ""because it's for losers"". He also asserted in defence of quitting school that he'd ""made millions"" -- of mistakes, I suspected -- and aimed to hike north for as long as it was working out for him. I suspect of the millions, he was in the process of making one more but opted instead to keep that observation to myself and to give some platitudinously supportive comment instead. 

I was still mulling this when I reached the turnoff to the retroblazing trail. Apart from sending me a message, the others said if they backed off the route, they'd leave crossed sticks or something similar to say it wasn't feasible. At least five of them had gone this way but there was no such indication so I followed them.

What followed next was the classic example of the psychology behind why people stick with bad decisions. The trail started off being as good as the main AT and slowly deteriorated but in time it became seriously overgrown when it entered a burned area where there was lots of shrubby regrowth because of the absence of tall trees taking the sun. 

Then a huge downed tree lying lengthways along the trail a few miles after the turnoff prompted those who had gone this way to head off in two directions. Happy Feet had left a note for me saying that Sweetblood and Sriracha had headed left, straight down towards Hot Springs, but she and OK were heading right.
Heading left was what prompted Sweetblood's later phone messages to me. Going right seemed most likely to be the correct way -- and some old and faded white blazes later showed that was accurate.

Our approach was familiar to anyone who's made a bad property investment or believed in letters from Nigerian princes, is that we'd already invested too much to back out and retrace our steps back to the turnoff. I remember thinking to myself: ""How bad can the rest of the trail be?"" And of course, the consequence of (a) the amount of time and energy I'd already invested, (b) the distance back to the real AT, and (c) the teasingly close proximity to where the old AT emerged onto a road ensured that the final mile or so was the worst bit of all.
In truth it was doable, if not particularly enjoyable, but with the wisdom of hindsight, the smart decision would have been to take the longer real AT route. Now, if only I'd been warned!

Soon I was crossing the French Broad River -- it was brown, roiling and swollen, just to prove that yesterday's storm was no figment of our collective imaginations -- then walking down the main street of Hot Springs. 

This was a very pleasant town and that impression was bolstered when I discovered the outfitter offered thru-hikers a free computer terminal to book and print their Great Smoky Mountains National Park permits. I then found a restaurant selling awesome food that was awesomely stodgy even by the standards of the South and then found the others at Laughing Heart hostel.

2am was there, having hiked in the previous evening in the rain and then opted to zero, along with Boss, Sweets, Bangles, Counselor and Tea Time, who all hiked in today.

Soon we'd all resupplied and showered, after which the sobo mega bubble met up again to have dinner at a bar/restaurant with a singer then went for a hot tub from the town's eponymous springs, which were warm enough to keep us toasty as we wandered back through the streets of Hot Springs on a night that was clear and bitterly cold.

Life is very good.

AT fact of the day: Also in town was Vietnam Vet, which was something of a surprise given he should have been at least a day behind us. It turned out that he too seemed to be a manifestation of that subset of AT hikers who only pretend to hike. The presence of his car key on his belt -- which had confused me when I'd spotted it way back at Clyde Smith shelter, at which time he said it was so he could get into his car at home in Maryland if nobody was present when he returned from the trail -- now made more sense. This fake-hiker thing is a very puzzling phenomenon of this trail...","Little Laurel shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584797,"There didn't seem much prospect of sugar-coating the task ahead: from Hot Springs, the trail climbed straight up for 3000ft.

But it turned out there was actually a way to sugar-coat this, once I realised over breakfast that it was going to be feasible for us to slackpack the 20 miles to Max Patch. Why I hadn't realised this the day before is a mystery to me, but after a couple of phone calls I'd arranged for a local guy to collect our packs from the hostel and meet us at Max Patch around 6pm.

Unfortunately Sweetblood and Dirt had already headed up the trail by then but Sriracha, who hung around town to buy a couple more things from Dollar General for the haul across to our next resupply in Gatlinburg, enthusiastically took up the option of carrying a much lighter pack.

In truth, the climb out of town was actually OK, thanks in part to the trifecta of a steadily graded trail, chilly temps that made exertion appealing rather than enervating, and also because I'd eaten close to my body weight in classic Southern breakfast stodge, which is the perfect fuel for this kind of activity.

In terms of the weather, it seems likely we've transitioned from having warm temperatures with occasional cold spells to the autumnal norm of having chilly conditions with occasional mild temperatures.

This is a concern because we still have ahead of us the highest section of the trail, through Great Smoky Mountain National Park, which is notorious for blizzards for the nobo earlybirds and for the sobos of the fall.

The silver lining of this is that the autumn colours keep getting better and better. I'd thought the coppery hues as we crossed Firescald mountain were impressive three days before but today the forest was awash in golden leaves.

Given we hadn't left town until 9.30am, I was glad it only took four hours to do the 11 miles to the top of the mountain, having caught up with Dirt and Sweetblood near the top. We headed on and had lunch at Walnut Mountain shelter, a dilapidated but atmospheric old lean to which was renown to be the most mouse-ridden on the entire AT.

That set us up to take it easier after lunch, since we had about four hours to do nine miles and without any huge climbs along the way.

Our goal was Max Patch, which was also known to be one of the nicest balds on the entire AT. After Dirt and I had extolled to Sweetblood, Sriracha and 2am the enjoyment of cowboy camping on top of Beauty Spot a week or so earlier, we were aiming to camp right on top of Max Patch to get the full benefit of the sunset and the following sunrise.

The Second Breakfast Club had done this last night but we hadn't yet heard that this came at a cost of freezing their asses off, prompting many midnight regrets. 

By the time we got to Max Patch, the views were everything they'd been billed to be but the bone-ass cold temperatures and howling wind made it clear that camping on top was not going to be feasible. Instead we headed back down into the treeline and camped on an old abandoned road.

Sriracha and I headed to the road, half a mile ahead, to get the contents of our packs and then I reclimbed to the top of Max Patch for the sunset. We all had every single stitch of clothing on and I was only able to last for 30 minutes before uncontrolled shivering began.

By then, the sun had set over the Smokies, into which we're heading tomorrow. At least climbing the range is likely to keep us warm.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: As this hike nears its completion, we're starting the process of doing things for the last time. Today, for example, the trail through Hot Springs is the last time it goes through a town. Over the next few weeks we'll reach our last state, our last resupply, our last hot shower and then finally our last camp, our last shelter, the last road crossing and then finally the last white blaze. This is a familiar process from the PCT and then CDT, and it serves as a way to adjust -- in as much as one can -- to the looming end of trail life...","Hot Springs, NC

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584868,"Which of today's two last-time moments should be highlighted, now that we're at the stage of this epic hike that we're counting down the last times we're doing things?

If I was trying to impress, I'd mention that entering Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the last national park we hike in on the AT. (And oddly enough it's also only the second, after Shenandoah National Park, so I guess it's not all that special.)

But since I'm long past the phase in life of trying to impress, my favourite last-time moment of today was of a different kind: we crossed our last interstate highway, I40. More importantly, that meant it was the last chance to follow the AT tradition of mooning every interstate, although because the trail crossed via an underpass it meant Sriracha and I had to, um, express ourselves via the off ramp.

Today also featured a first: the first time we've stayed in a shelter protected by chain-link fencing and with a bear-proof latch on the only door.

This is in keeping with the Smokies' reputation for bears, which in turn is why park rules ban hikers from staying overnight anywhere other than the shelters and camping is only allowed if the shelter concerned is full. Gulp!

All the day's landmarks happened in the latter part of today and the first half of today was almost verging on dull as the trail followed an undulating ridgeline through the usual viewless forests. In another month when the leaves are gone, the views will be better but we're glad we'll be done with the trail well before then.

The location of our campsite, on an abandoned road near where it headed around a spur, was yet more proof of the katabatic effect. The proximity to the spur meant there was very little hill above us and what we'd missed through this was made clear when I wandered along the road towards a gully to attend to my morning constitutional. The cold air flowing down from the balds of Max Patch meant the temperature just a few minutes walk from our campsite dropped by about 10 degrees.

The lack of gobsmacking views or other distractions is always conducive to doing the miles and we hauled along for a couple of hours before our first break, at which point we were overtaken by two sobos, Potable and Sticks, who were hauling ass and were on a four-month schedule to finish the AT. 

The only break from the forest was a small bald which we shared with some kind of aircraft navigational facility, although of greater concern to us was the ability to sit in the sun, which made it the perfect place for lunch.

Then we went back into the forest again for the long gradual descent to Standing Bear Farm, a hostel that is a true AT landmark -- partly for commemorating nobos completion of the Smokies, which is often an ordeal of snow, ice and low temperatures, but also because it's famous for outbreaks of norovirus, the consequence of the cumulative effect of poor trail nutrition and equally poor trail hygiene. 

Like a lot of other famous AT hostels, it had the usual coterie of sketchy hangers on ""working"" there. But it was friendly enough and my main goal was to resupply for the short hop over to Gatlinburg. 

It turned out that the Second Breakfast Club had had the same idea when they came through the day before, which meant the cupboards were pretty bare. There was, however, enough to resupply, although that involved buying some brands of energy bars I'd never heard of before, which is often a leap into the unknown. I guess I'll find out in the next couple of days.

Potable and Sticks were also present and the others in Team KRT rocked in over the next hour, during which we warmed ourselves externally (via a heater in the communal kitchen) and internally (via the pizzas they sold for $10). 

Just as we were leaving, OK and Happy Feet rocked up. They explained that her main cold-weather clothing was a puffy jacket, which she'd worn for the climb out of Hot Springs but her sweat had rendered it useless, prompting them to stop early and make a fire to dry it back out again.

She was very very happy to find that Standing Bear Farm sold cold weather clothing bought from local Goodwill shops, including a perfect Mountain Equipment windproof fleece for $5.

Soon after this we crossed I40 and then began a grunty 1200ft climb up to Davenport Gap shelter, in the midst of which we crossed into the national park then hauled up to the bear-proof shelter, where we were happy to call it a day.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: When I met Potable and Sticks, they asked if I was ""the triple-crowner"", meaning someone who'd hiked the AT, PCT and CDT, the three main US trails.
I replied: ""Not yet."" Even though we're about 90 per cent of the way through the AT, there's still plenty of options for things can go wrong and to confirm the universe's fondness for hubris. As I told the others in Team KRT, I'll only become slightly confident of completing this trail when I cross Neels Gap, 30 miles from the end...","Max Patch
",Davenport Gap shelter,"Oct 26, Thu",16.50
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584947,"""I'm kinda thinking,"" I said to the others as we lazed about in the sun, ""about doing 27 miles today to save hiking much in the rain tomorrow.""

This did not make a lot of sense, given that I said this at 11.30am and, in true Team KRT procrastinatory fashion, we'd done all of 3.5 miles so far today before settling in for an extended break. 

We'd planned to do the 30-mile haul across to Newfound Gap, from which we'd head in to Gatlinburg, in two 15-mile days. There was even a shelter at almost exactly the halfway point, which seemed impossibly apt.

But then we got the weather forecast, which was for mild and clear weather today but for a serious cold and wet blast coming in overnight. The high today was forecast to be 47degF/8degC but tomorrow, the warmest it would get was forecast to be 29degF/-2degC. And that the warmest -- the low was predicted to be 23degF/-5degC. And that was in Gatlinburg, 5000ft lower than we're going to be.
As we left the shelter this morning there'd been talk about reaching the shelter at 20 miles, which was quite a way off trail and was said to have an unreliable water supply. By the time I reached the lookout, the idea of a 27-mile day had crept into my head.

Sweetblood and Dirt didn't think it seemed likely, although they increased their goal to the shelter 20 miles in so they'd only have 10 miles to do tomorrow. But Sriracha, 2am, OK and Happy Feet could see the wisdom of this change of plan, even if the wisdom of adopting this at 11.30am was not nearly as obvious.

To say the least, the tenor of the day changed rather a lot at that moment.

One reason why we'd tarried so long at this break was that it was a spectacular viewpoint and that the forest below included the best autumn colours yet. At some point we're going to hit peak colour, after which they'd decline, and we were wondering if this was the moment -- and a sunny spot on a windless day seemed like quite a good place to contemplate this.

But from then on, we had to haul ass. As the designated slowest member of Team KRT, I was resigned to finishing in the dark but the others were hopeful of having enough light.

And it's not like the next 23 miles is easy. By one estimate, we have 6000ft of cumulative climbing, including 500ft at the very end of the day.

In truth, I actually enjoyed the rest of today as one of those improbable challenges that feel so good to complete. After nearly 2000 miles, we're pretty fit and have a now finely-honed ability to settle into an all-day pace, even though in this case ""all day"" really did mean what it said.

I had one short break at Tricorner Knob shelter, our original destination, for a late lunch at 3.30pm and then pushed on for the final 12-mile leg. Fortunately the climbs were steady rather than brutal and the trail tread was good.

It helped too that the final seven miles was particularly beautiful, along a narrow crest of a ridge that had been made into an easy horse-grade trail thanks to unknown workers when this was a depression-era work project.

After one of the nicer sunsets I'd seen, I had to finally break out the headlamp around 7.10pm, after which it took a little while to get used to the spooky effect of shadows moving around. I knew from my adventure racing days that it was important not to put the head lamp on one's head and better depth perception would come from carrying it wrapped around my left hand, which in turn grabbed my pack strap.

It took another hour and a half in the dark to complete the hike to Icewater Spring shelter, which was full to the rafters with other hikers also hiding from the storm. Thanks to a generous overhang, I was able to crash out on the dirt in front of the sleeping platform, alongside OK and Happy Feet.

I was in pretty good shape considering the distance and the exertion, which failed to out-trump the feeling of satisfaction of making it here tonight. 

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Our last for the day: the last time on the AT that I expect to do 6000ft of cumulative climbing or hike a marathon. That's not such a bad thing.","Davenport Gap shelter
",Icewater Spring shelter,"Oct 27, Fri",26.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585023,"The wisdom of yesterday's impromptu marathon was apparent this morning, when the rain bucketed down from just before dawn.

One of the groups in the shelter had left at 3.30am -- around three hours before first light -- and presumably to beat the rain. Another left right at dawn, and managed to time their departure to EXACTLY the arrival of the heavy rain. 

OK, Happy Feet and me took their newly-freed places on the sleeping platforms, alongside Sriracha and 2am, and quickly concluded that there are few pleasures more enjoyable than watching torrential rain from the inside of the shelter. 

Admittedly we knew that we'd have to go out into this at some point but we opted to let the future versions of ourselves worry about that and in the meantime we'd revel in knowing we aren't the ones sloshing our way along a flooded trail.

Of course two members of Team KRT were out in this and were on their way to us from the shelter about seven miles back. We felt a little bad about that, but then went back to enjoying the ability to watch the rain outside from the warm and dry environs of our sleeping bags.

After we'd enjoyed several hours of pleasant indolence, Dirt and Sweetblood rocked up at about 10.40am. They were pretty wet but being able to keep moving was enough to keep them warm enough, which is why they headed on after a couple of minutes at the shelter. This was our cue to pack up and follow them.

By that point, our decision to defer to our future selves was paying dividends because the rain had tapered off to a nuisance drizzle. My umbrella, which I'd been carrying since Harpers Ferry and which had so far worked as the perfect rain deterrent, was enough to keep me dry as we headed over the top of the ridge above the shelter and then down to Newfound Gap.

What was surprising was how many people were out, given the miserable conditions, in the short three-mile stretch between our shelter and the road and it took me a while to realise it was the weekend. What made a greater impression was how poorly equipped many of these hikers were, with one -- young, white male, of course -- carrying no pack or rain jacket and wearing a cotton T-shirt. 

Once at Newfound Gap, we regrouped and found Jamey, Sweetblood's dad, who had driven up from North Carolina to do trail magic for her and the rest of the extended Team KRT. 

Soon we'd squeezed into a white van and were driven down through absurdly pretty autumn colours towards the distinctly unlovely town of Gatlinburg, where we had lunch, went to a Walmart to buy supplies for the next day, and then went to a lush mountain home Jamey had booked on Airbnb.

And boy, was it lush. It was one of those trophy holiday homes for which the US is famous, featuring five bedrooms and a games room and open fire places etc. It was really nice and I'd be tempted to say we're not going to leave the house, but we can see a hot tub on the deck...

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We weren't just buying supplies at Walmart. As today's photo shows, we also bought Halloween costumes to hike in for the next few days. Can I beat my record in 2010 on the CDT, when my tramily successfully trick-or-treated for beer?","Icewater Spring shelter

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585120,"The snow that was falling at our mountain mansion, 5000ft lower than we'd been on the AT, made it very easy to decide to stay an extra day here and abandon our plan to hike out.

What made it even easier was getting messages from the others we knew in front of and behind us.

The Second Breakfast Club had headed back to the trail on the day we came down but encountered truly miserable weather. Many of them are pretty minimalist in terms of gear -- as shown when they posted photos showing them wearing puffy jackets with cheap plastic rain jackets over the top as they headed through a foot or more of snow -- and we knew these were unforgiving conditions in the mountains.

Fern, Gully, Wrong Way and others were behind us by a couple of days on Max Patch, where they also encountered snow a foot deep and cold blustery winds.

And us? We did battle with a hot tub and drank beer... http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And in case some people think we were shirking, we continued Dirt's catch-up of iconic movies that she missed because of her deeply religious upbringing. Last night was The Big Lebowski and today was Fight Club. A true sign of a quality movie is they stand up even when seen again -- particularly Fight Club -- so this was truly no hardship.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: It'd be tempting to think that because we didn't hike today, there wouldn't be another ""last thing"", where we're doing something for the last time on the trail. But that's not so. Giardia takes two weeks to incubate and with our projected finish date of November 11, today is the last day we need to treat water if we want to avoid getting afflicted by intestinal distress on the trail. (We'll keep treating it anyway, since giardia isn't much fun even if you do have easy access to porcelain, but it's just one more landmark on the way to Springer.)","Gatlinburg

...and found the road was closed.

The culprit seemed to be the national park's environmental rules that prevent salting the road so that even a remarkably modest quantity of snow was able to keep the road shut even after temperatures had risen.

After faffing for a while, we headed back to Gatlinburg, which was even less lovely than it had seemed two days earlier and we understood why it was informally known as the Redneck Riviera. Apart from the existence of Dollywood, the -- and I'm not kidding -- Dolly Parton theme park outside town, there were T-shirt shops portraying Trump as Superman, some kind of Jesusworld Christian-themed attraction and lots and lots of places selling things like corn dogs and funnel cakes.

Jamey headed back home with our thanks for his generosity over the previous few days and then we spent the afternoon waiting to hear if there was any news on the road. 

The prospect of the road opening today seemed unlikely so 2am looked online for a place to stay in town and found two rooms in a motel that could take all of us for $100. That included an all-you-can-eat breakfast where I'm pretty sure we can get our money's worth...

We'd just booked that when we received a text message from the rangers that the road was open... Of course!

I was happy to head up now and forfeit the hotel booking but it seemed like I was alone in this so instead we spent the rest of the afternoon wandering around the awesomeness that is an abandoned mini-golf course, then whiskey tasting and dinner at a pub-restaurant after which we took part in the quiz night as ""Team Hiker Trash"", blitzing the first two rounds but then falling at the end.

All this might explain why the evening ended with all of us getting ""This ass climbed Mt Washington"" -- a tattoo we'd half-seriously talked about getting as a tramily -- written on our asses in Sharpie. 

Hmmm. Maybe you had to be there...

But life is good, and tomorrow we're due to go higher than than Mt Washington for the first and only time on the AT.

How could I resist that, and especially when I used the ass Sharpies to change it to ""Rolling Thunder buddies""? Except my costume really really looked like Pedo Bear instead!

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585264,"Does it make easier or harder to hitch hike in a redneck town while dressed as a pedo bear, Eeyore, Super Mario and a raging bull? And also when we're in a group of eight, since we also have OK, Happy Feet, Dirt and Packaged Meat in our crew? And also when hitch hiking is illegal in Gatlinburg?

It turned out I needn't have worried because as we walked to the edge of Gatlinburg this morning, a guy came up and said: ""Are you thru-hiking? Do you need a lift up to Newfound Gap? We're going that way.""

This was our introduction to Pizza Maker, who had thru-hiked the AT way back in 1984 but was in town for some kind of tourist convention as part of his T-shirt design job. What that meant was he had a van that could easily fit all of us in one go as he and some friends went up for a day hike. In the end, we split between the van and his friend's Jeep.

He even offered to give us all free T-shirts, which led his friend to look askance at him and say that he'd never been offered a free T-shirt!

But soon we were back up at the pass and profusely thanking our unlikely benefactor, then headed off along snow-covered trails under a clear but cold blue-sky day. 

I'd been worried about being warm enough but I ended up facing the opposite problem. My $20 Walmart bear suit was seriously toasty, to the extent that after unzipping it as far as possible (and beyond the demands of modesty) and rolling up the arms and legs, I was overheating.

Getting sweaty is not pretty in the outdoors so after a couple of miles, I reluctantly ditched my bear suit and hiked in the thermal top and the short wash-day shorts I'd been wearing underneath. And since my wash-day shorts were chosen for low weight rather than high modesty, they were very short

If I'd been getting odd looks for my pedo bear outfit -- oddly enough, it seemed few people were realising that today was Halloween -- that was nothing compared to the looks I was getting for walking through ice and snow in short shorts and a flimsy shirt. 

One South African guy section hiking northbound even asked if I'd ""got the memo"" about it being full wintery conditions. In truth, the level of clothing worked perfectly for the grunty climb up to Clingman's Dome, even though it was clear from the thick water ice on the trails that there'd been a freeze-thaw process going on yesterday.

We had lunch at the bottom of the dome, which at 6643ft/2024m the highest point in Tennessee and on the entire AT. It also features a 1950s-era spiral-shaped concrete observation tower that was another 45ft higher but ever since we'd been in Maine, we'd heard that it was closed for the rest of the year for restoration work. 

Thanks to our extended stay in Gatlinburg, I wasn't entirely sure where Three Goldilocks and the Bear were at this point but I knew that the sisters, Pumba and Professor Sprout, had hiked to here from Springer as a warm-up for their sobo hike. That helped explain why they'd managed to hit the ground running in Maine but we weren't sure if they'd then finish their hikes here or accompany the other two, Cricket and Dr Bronner, for the remaining way to Springer so they could finish together. 

What we did know was that we reached the 200 miles to go marker was shortly after we left Clingman's Dome, which of course was done with the patently false admonition that it was ""all downhill from here to Springer"".

We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the rest of the day was almost all on the sunny side of the range, which meant the near-total absence of the snow and ice that had prompted us to walk carefully all morning.

Later we crossed the 2000-mile mark on an otherwise unremarkable traverse across a snowy, north-facing face of a knoll and then soon after that we arrived at the shelter where we intended to spend tonight.

It was awesome to find Wizard there since we hadn't seen him since Damascus. Soon we were caught up on his recent adventures, which included being at Icewater Spring shelter -- our destination of our 27-mile day -- with Counsellor and Turtle Trax for the blizzards that we'd missed by being in Gatlinburg.

It was clear we'd really dodged a bullet by getting out of the range when we did. Because it had been raining as they'd hiked up into the Smokies, all their stuff was wet and in the shelter everything froze rock hard as temperatures dropped to 17degF/-8degC. It sounded harrowing and particularly when they did a dash over to Newfound Gap to escape down to Gatlinburg, only to find the road closed by ice.

But now we've got a fire going and telling lots of stories about the past few months on the trail.

",Derrick Knob shelter,"Oct 31, Tue",17.80
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585354,"The Smokies are notorious on the AT for being a serious obstacle. Because of their height and the correspondingly bad weather, many sobos only become confident they will complete the trail once they emerge from the range. For nobos, it's their first big test.

All this makes it curious that for us, the Smokies have been the scene of two of our longest days on our entire hike. 

The first was weather related, as we opted to do a marathon-plus day with a big-ass climb to avoid an incoming blizzard. Today also had an external focus, but of a different kind: the Fontana Hilton.

The actual name is the Fontana Dam shelter, but such was its reputation for luxury -- with a solar-powered phone charging station, hot showers (!) and, most famously, the ability to order pizzas to the door -- that the Hilton tag has stuck. The pizza aspect in particular was a strong motivating factor, which became rather ironic in light of later events.

This mileage didn't seem likely that morning, with Dirt complaining about a painful back and Happy Feet still suffering because her recent conversion to zero-drop Altra shoes had left her with distinctly unhappy feet. Along with Wizard, who just wasn't feeling up for a big day, they were all talking about stopping at a campsite after 18 miles.

At first the trail rollercoasted steeply up and down along the ridge, making the miles seem even longer, but once we got past Mollies Ridge shelter, the trail began a long and nearly constant descent out of the Smokies towards Fontana Dam and our enthusiasm returned for reaching the Fontana Hilton.

As we reached the campsite, all of us except for Wizard opted to continue. The last landmark before the dam was Shuckstack Mountain fire tower, which was open and had a commanding view over the most of the range we'd just traversed. 

I wasn't going to bother making the steep 0.1 detour up to it until the admonitions of the others persuaded me to change my mind and it was indeed an impressive view. The treads on the fire tower stairs had also been recently replaced, which improved my faith in them, but no such love had been lavished any time recently on the actual observation room itself. It would certainly be an entertaining place to sleep in strong winds.

Just as I returned from that diversion, Tarzan -- a member of the Second Breakfast Club -- rocked up. He'd got off trail for a few days to visit his girlfriend and was now in the midst of a 32 mile day to catch up to his tramily, who I suspect are a couple of days ahead. He is one of the strongest hikers I know but he's aiming to do nearly 100 miles in three days to catch the Second Breakfast Club. That certainly put our supposed long day into perspective!

After that, it was a slog down through yet more beautifully autumn-toned forests down to the dam, across it and then to the Hilton a little way beyond. Happy Feet and I arrived together right on dark. 

We were surprised to find there was nothing in the shelter to indicate how to order pizza. Usually there are menus in the hut register or a brochure pinned to the wall but here there was nothing, even though the pizza ordering capability is the number one reason why the Fontana Hilton is so well known. It was practically an article of faith.

We tried googling it, thanks to having strong cellphone reception, but also to no avail. Maybe it's only during summer months when the dam's visitor center is open? Instead we were left wondering.

Thanks to not being sure we'd get here tonight, most of us had been carrying an extra meal so the lack of pizza is an inconvenience rather than something serious.

So instead we're concentrating on our luxurious accommodation, which is indeed definitely a step up on what we're used to.

Life is good.

",Fontana Hilton,"Nov 01, Wed",23.70
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585434,"We'd only been going a little more than a mile this morning when we found a pair of moss-covered old boots near a trailhead at Fontana Village Resort Marina. Closer examination showed they were full of pebbles.
A laminated note explained the context. These boots belonged to James/Bamahiker, who had harboured a dream to thru-hike the AT in 2016 when he retired and in his various section hikes before that, this was the furthest north he'd reached. 
But as his wife explained in the note, less than two years before his thru-hike, he was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. ""He fought hard to beat this goliath, but God had other plans. James went home to be with his lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, on July 15, 2015.""
She'd put a pair of his old boots here, filled them with pebbles and invited hikers to take one, carry it ""to the end of their hike, wherever that may be"" and then email her a photo.
""Carrying his pebbles would be symbolic of James hiking the AT. Please help my husband's dream continue to come true."" 
And that's why I'm now carrying a pebble. 
I suspect this request was primarily aimed at northbounders so Bamahiker could vicariously reach Katahdin but I figure any distance would provide some kind of solace to Mrs Bamahiker. And since I'm writing this long after finishing the trail, I can attest that it completed the rest of the AT and did the Coast to Coast adventure race in New Zealand and the plan is to leave it on Mt Wilhelm, the highest peak in Papua New Guinea, in May.
But all that was in the future. We made up for our pizza disappointment last night by taking a shuttle to have breakfast at Fontana Village Resort, which had been formed from the dam construction camp. We had to go to the resort anyway to resupply so breakfast was a bonus. 
We didn't get back to the trail until around 11am, which must have been frustrating for Tarzan, who had come down to resupply but hadn't eaten at the restaurant and had to wait for us to finish before taking the shuttle back to the trail. For us it's not a big deal but he's aiming to do 32 miles today and it's much more pleasant to do that in daylight than darkness.
It was soon after starting the hike today that I found Bamahiker's boots and picked up a pebble. This was just at the start of a loooong but steadily graded climb to regain the ridgeline once more, on which we undulated for most of the rest of the day.
On the way up, I passed Happy Feet who was still adjusting painfully to her first zero-drop shoes. She's a pretty staunch hiker who, like all of us out here, doesn't like to admit weakness but it's clear she's doing it tough. We all sympathised, especially at being in pain after already having hiked so many miles and when we are so close to the end.
Lunch was at Cable Gap shelter, which looked idyllic from afar but as I approached I was told by the others that the shelter itself was swarming with wasps, which explained why they were sitting maybe 50 yards away. Even there, there was a steady stream of wasps flying around.
The rest of the day was pretty unmemorable other than a seriously steep descent towards Stecoah Gap, where Sweetwater Road crossed the ridge. It was steep enough for me to briefly regret sending home my hiking poles way back in Daleville and I'm sure it could still hear the profanities of as-yet-trail-unhardened nobos who would have suffered as they slogged their way up.
There was another solid climb up from the gap and I paid for our late start by being overtaken by darkness about three miles from our intended campsite at Locust Grove Gap. Once again, I ended up hiking by headlamp and was very grateful to smell woodsmoke and then see the fire the others in the tramily had created.
Soon we were all sitting around, cooking our respective dinners, when we heard the sound of someone hiking northbound without a light. A young bearded guy soon appeared in the gap and came down to chat -- although ""chat"" might have been an ambitious description for a conversation that followed.
Even though we've hit the odd southern AT zone where there are several supposed thru-hikers who are really just pursuing a mobile version of homelessness and even a few who have made wild claims of thru-hiking powers that haven't stood the test of scrutiny, we try to take people on their word.
This guy was very cagey about saying his name and, once he said he'd was a musician, was even cagier about naming the band he said he was in. And it didn't take long for big holes to appear in his stories about supplies at Nantalaha Outdoor Center, which he variously said he'd left that day or several days ago.
But whatever. We figure people can be who they claim to be out here so long as it doesn't affect us and soon we all headed to bed. He stayed around the fire for a while but then abruptly opted to hike on into the night. Our strong suspicion is he not only didn't have a headlamp but also didn't have a tent and a gentle rain began. We heard later from those behind us that he rocked up to the next lean to, Brown Fork Gap shelter, sometime around 2am and slept inside. The South certainly has its characters!
Now it's quiet again and I'm being serenaded to sleep by the gentle patter of rain on my tent.
Life is good.
AT fact of the day: I'm really hoping that today's ""last time"" moment is hiking by headlamp... This is a skill I'd like to retire from my repertoire.","Fontana Hilton

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585532,"Just one day after vowing to retire night hiking from my repertoire of thru-hiking skills, we're rushing down a hill trying to take advantage of the last tiny bit of twilight before it turns into fully fledged darkness.

Failure? Short memory? My slowness, even by the standards of the officially slowest member of Team KRT?

Instead I'm more than happy with this course of events, because it reflects the tramily's willingness to change the plan when events on the trail justify it -- and the truly gobsmacking sunset views from Wesser Bald Fire Tower were more than justification. In truth, the only reason we were heading down rather than camping on the tower itself was because we were being bribed with Bojangles cajun chicken biscuits, brought by some university friends of Sriracha and Sweetblood from North Carolina.

We'd known about the Bojangles -- er, sorry, the reunion with Sriracha and Sweetblood's friends -- for a while, and that was part of the reason for hiking as far as we did the day before, because it put us in a position where we'd definitely reach Tellico Gap tonight. It was easy for us to get going this morning for that reason and also because at lunchtime, we were due to cross the Nantahala River, which was the site of the Nantahala Outdoor Center and its corresponding restaurant.

(Did I mention that the second half of any thru hike revolves around landmarks of food rather than geography?)

The immediate goal as I set off ahead of the others was the bald within a few miles of our campsite but the bad weather that had caused the rain overnight was hanging around, with cloud teasingly close to burning off denying me a view.

I dropped into Cold Spring shelter to fill up with water but was amused to find a large empty bottle of Trader Joe's water in the shelter itself. ""Pure New Zealand artesian spring water"" was the claim on the label, which was enough to raise a smile for those like me from Christchurch, with its aquifer-sourced water system, because that's what we call tap water.

Then there was a long descent down to Nantahala Outdoor Center, which was sited overlooking a white water kayaking course. The others were there and about half of us headed to the restaurant for an appropriate carbo-loading meal.

The food was helpful because immediately afterwards, we faced a 4000ft ascent that felt -- and was! -- the biggest hill since The Priest, way back in northern Virginia. But unlike on that hill, the grade of the trail here was steady rather than steep and we had the added benefit of fall colours in the forest that were truly mesmerising. 

Near the top of the climb, there was a burned area which provided views off to the west, revealing the best autumn colours yet. Could it get better than this? (Spoiler alert, since I'm writing this months afterwards: no)

After that, there was a gentle rollercoaster route along a ridgeline, with a gushing spring just before the final ascent to Wesser Bald Fire Tower at which I filled up for the night. These towers have been a mixed bag. Some have been awesome, while others were open but dilapidated, some have been too dangerous to climb and some have been locked. It turned out that this fire tower had burnt down or fallen over years ago but had been replaced relatively recently with a viewing platform.

The others' packs showed they'd made the ascent and I followed suit, finding the tower had a grandstand view of one of the most spectacular sunsets of the entire hike. We had it to ourselves, with the exception of one local guy who'd walked up and gave us the beta that there was a fire trail that went straight to Tellico Gap, unlike the meandering AT route. 

The sunset kept getting better and better, which in turn made our departure later and later. And it really was only the obligation to meet Sriracha and Sweetbloods' friends that prompted us to leave, after which we hustled down the trail.

It was still barely light enough when we reached the pass and found that the only apparent place to camp was a car parking zone. We set up a little reluctantly but with the understanding that when our Bojangles deliverers, Thomas, Katie and Alyssa, arrived, they'd park their car to stop others driving into our tents. 

We had a series of calls saying they were running late but since hunger is the best condiment, that meant we were even more vocal when they arrived around 9pm bearing Bojangles and beer.

It was fun to meet them and to see Sriracha and Sweetblood tell them about the last five months on the trail.

Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585701,"The US approach to firearms is utterly perplexing to those outside the country but apart from some genuine hunters we've been meeting, that hasn't really been a factor out here on the trail.
Until today, when I met a guy who exemplified the guns-are-essential mindset. He was a section hiker with an enormous pack that already boasted an axe and a hatchet. At his hip, he had a handgun of substantial calibre but said it was just one of a range of firearms he had contemplating carrying for his safety.
""I really think that if you're hiking with anything less than a .22,"" he said, ""you're just being irresponsible.""
Right.
I was happy he was heading the other way and I headed on, prepared to repel bears and mountain lions and other threats in my usual way: using my personality.
Our lunchtime destination was Wayah Bald, which had a road leading to the top from the south and featured a substantial stone lookout that had been ravaged by fire. It was still a good place to stop for something to eat, with a commanding view off to the east.
Just beyond was a forest which had burned at the same time as the stone tower and which was the scene of a trail crew learning how to fell trees safely with a chainsaw. One said hello as we passed and introduced himself as Colin, whose hostel, Gooder Grove, we were heading to that night. 
After that, there was a long haul along a gradually descending ridgeline towards Wayah Road, after which there was a short uphill and another final descent down to Winding Stair Gap.
One of the final landmarks on this route was Swinging Lick Gap -- a Lick being a local term for a trail or route -- but I already knew what I'd find if there was a sign. Juvenile humour had, after all, already been a constant on the trail and someone with a distinctly adolescent sense of humour had earlier changed Deer Lick Gap in Virginia by adjusting the L to become a D. Sure enough, this one too was vandalised in the same way.
Soon after that I emerged onto the highway at Winding Stair Gap to find the others had all already got rides towards Franklin, about 15 miles away. It took me about 30 minutes before someone was kind enough to stop and I was doubly grateful when they went out of their way to drop me within a few minutes walk of Gooder Grove Hostel, where I reunited with the others of Team KRT.
This was a seriously cool place with the owner, Colin, setting just the right atmosphere. The best proof of this were the house rules: ""Be kind, be kind of clean, and enjoy being.""
And after we'd done the chores of showering -- ""kind of clean"" was about as much as any of us hoped for after 2000 miles -- and laundry he was nice enough to drive us into town.
We had dinner at the Detroit diner, on his recommendation, then wandered a couple of hundred metres to our real goal, the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company, for post-meal beers such as Trail Mate golden ale, Slack Pack IPA, Springer Fever pilsner and Twentymile IPA. Even better, it had a mammoth 5m/15ft long AT trail map on the wall, showing how far we've come and how close we are to the end.
After resupplying at the nearby supermarket in town -- a funnier but potentially more hazardous option in light of our brewery visit -- Colin was kind enough to come by and collect us again. And he gave us a discount price to stay since there were six of us. 
I opted to leave my pedo bear outfit to add to his loaner clothes collection, which he was absolutely certain would be go-to clothing for at least some of the hikers who followed. It's that kind of place.
Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585787,"After having an amazingly rain-free run for the second half of the AT, with the only real precipitation having occurred when we were taking some spectacularly serendipitous zero days, the forecast is suggesting that our run of luck is about to come to an abrupt end.

It rained overnight while we were in Franklin, just as it had the night before when we were camping, and the latest long-range forecast has it raining until just before we reach Springer Mountain.

While rain tends to be far more of a problem for nobos in the spring, we were resigned to the next 110 miles or so being a damp affair but also knew that we were so close to the end that even a return of the snow was unlikely to stand in our way.

Because of the threatening skies, we were very happy to defer our departure while we created a stonkingly good cooked breakfast at Gooder Grove. Usually we head to a diner for a final dose of town food but I don't know why it took us so long to realise that with a bit of work, an even better meal can be created in a hostel kitchen for a fraction of the cost.

After Colin kindly drove us to the trail, the clouds remained grey, low and threatening but did not progress to actual rain as we ground our way back up to the ridgeline. Eventually some sunshine -- wan and chilled, admittedly, but sunshine nonetheless -- even began to shine through.

We had a good landmark to aim for our midday break. Albert Mountain fire tower offered a fine view, particularly to the east, and although the viewing room was locked, the tower itself is exactly 99.9 miles from Springer Mountain. 

It's hard to believe all those months back in Maine that we'd finally be down to double-digits and with a finish date just six days away, but that wasn't the only Maine reference on offer here in the deep south: the trail headed down a series of sloping rock ledges in a distinctly Maine manner, requiring care and the use of hands. This was a reminder I didn't particularly need, but it was at least short lived and it made us more grateful when the trail resumed to the default setting of being a long series of traverses along the ridge.

By mid afternoon the cloud level had lowered to envelope the ridge we were walking through, making it much more atmospheric and damp but still without any actual rain for the rest of the afternoon until we reached Carter Gap shelter. 

Georgia is barely half a mile away due south of us but from here the trail loops back towards the north and doesn't actually cross the border for another 15.4 miles. But by any measure we'll be in our 14th and final state by tomorrow.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: My ""last thing"" for today is that I'm on the last fuel container of fuel for the trip, although not in happy circumstances. A pair of flip-flopping hikers who'd I'd met back in Vermont and who'd been at Gooder Grove last night are getting off the trail because the mother of one of them had died. They still had, I think, a few hundred miles to go but it sounds like they're now done with the trail for this year... I hope this is the last hiker getting off the trail we encounter.","Lazy Hiker Brewing Company, Franklin
",Carter Gap shelter,"Nov 05, Sun",15.90
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585860,"Normally reaching our 14th and final state on the AT would be a matter of significance, but we all blasted past the NC/GA sign with barely any fanfare.

The reason? After watching a damp night from within the dry interior of Carter Gap shelter, the forecast for tonight and tomorrow morning is much worse so most of us opted to push to get all the way to Dicks Creek Gap tonight. The idea is to take advantage of sleeping inside at Top of Georgia hostel and to make a late start tomorrow once the storm had rolled through.

To be fair, there isn't a lot to justify dawdling between here and there. It's not quite the monotonously flat, straight and forested ridgelines of much of the mid-Atlantic section of the AT but there still isn't much to slow down for. There probably wouldn't have been many views anyway, but even that prospect was nullified by hiking in cloud for most of the day.

Instead the most noteworthy factor was that we started half a mile from the border with Georgia but then began heading west and then veered due north, back towards Canada, for several miles. 

I'd experienced something similar on the PCT, when the nobo trail heads due south for a while in northern California and I surmised at the time that after more than three months in the state, it was doing this deliberately to trap us for longer. (This was followed by the mileage-sapping effect of amazing roadside blackberries and finally a wet spell -- bringing my rainfall total for whole of California to just 12 hours over three and a half months -- before we finally crossed into Oregon)
Since the AT was now far better built and with kinder grading that in the early months, maybe heading north was intended to be a last-ditch effort by the trail designers to delay our arrival at Springer?

That was something to ponder as we hiked on in conditions that were chilly and damp but not actually raining. We stopped into Muskrat Creek shelter for lunch and were fortunate to be there when a passing squall briefly soaked everything.

The only other occupant was a section hiker who said she'd thru-hiked the AT the previous year and so far had been festering in the shelter rather than heading out into the rain and was going to ask Colin from Gooder Grove to pick her up at the next road crossing rather than hiking further. 

It was unfortunate that after our experiences of several pretend hikers in the last month, I couldn't help but quietly assess her story for inconsistencies but everything checked out. Having to question hikers rather than my natural instinct of taking them at their word is yet another skill I hoped not to use again on the trail but this vow didn't even last until the end of the day...

We hiked on in a light drizzle after it passed and continued hiking through cloud and mist towards the NC/GA border, where I stopped for barely a minute and 2am took a quick photo. 

Our original destination for tonight was going to be Plumtree Orchard shelter, four and a half miles away, but the forecast storm was enough motivation for most of us to head all the way out to the road, which was another four and a half miles. Dirt was the only outlier, possibly for financial reasons.

By this point, I figured I'd be overtaken by darkness, just three days after I'd predicted that I'd night-hiked for the last time on the trip. But I was OK with this and the reward of being indoors tonight seemed a reasonable payoff.

I did the last three miles in the dark and emerged onto the road, grateful that it was just another half mile down the highway to Top of Georgia hostel, where I arrived about half an hour before their closing time of 9pm.

I'm not entirely sure what to make of the guy runnning it, Sir Packsalot. He claimed to be a triple crowner -- a claim subject to a lot of disbelief and derision in some hiking circles -- and also said this place is a non-profit but ran it with ruthless corporate efficiency, apparently trying to squeeze every cent out of us.

To give one example, he told us we were only allowed to use the WiFi for 10 minutes during our stay, which is a pretty bizarre request. The result is to make us feel like unwelcome barriers between him and our wallets. 

However since we're also only a little over 70 miles from the Springer, I figured he deserves a bit of leeway because he must get the worst of the crazy and deeply unprepared nobo hikers who start the trail as a form of therapy but haven't yet quit. He's also been busy with hikers since February, so he was probably also a little burnt out at the end of a long season.

I figure the next day or so would clarify these conflicting impressions. In the meantime, we're in a very clean hostel out of the rain and we've been able to get frozen pizzas to eat.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Our last state line! The next state line will be crossed by car. Our last hostel! Um, I think... The landmarks are starting to fly by. I'm not brave enough to say there'll be no more night hiking or any more fake hikers...","Carter Gap shelter
",Dicks Creek Gap,"Nov 06, Mon",24.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585935,"Our cunning plan to do a big day yesterday to avoid hiking in the rain today did not quite go the way we wanted.

For a start, any lingering benefit of the doubt we'd given Sir Packsalot was quickly dispelled this morning by a series of incidents. We resupplied from his store and found it was the most expensive store on the entire trail, which is quite something given that it's (a) in the South, which is way cheaper than New England, and (b) on a highway with a supermarket 15 minutes drive away. When energy bars cost more than the AMC huts, where the price factors in them being carried in on foot, it's safe to say there's a pretty healthy profit margin.

But that was up to us, since we had the option of hitching into town if we thought prices were unreasonable. What really rankled was how much shade he was throwing at Mountain Crossings store at Neels Gap, our next resupply, claiming they really gouged hikers. The clear intention was trying to convince us to resupply for the final 70-odd miles here but his prices and his demeanour turned us against that even more than the concern about the extra weight. 

(And, since I'm writing this after finishing the trail, I can say that Mountain Crossings is much cheaper than Sir Packsalot's rip-off store!)
We'd also told him the previous evening that we were aiming to leave sometime around midday to avoid the forecast early storms. He said checkout was 10am and asked us to bring our departure forward, which we did by agreement to 11am.

We were fully packed from about 10am but as we waited until the time we'd agreed to be driven back to the trail, he told us we weren't allowed to sit on the couches in the lounge. Seriously? The final straw was when he told us at 10.58am that it was time to go. Most of us were in the minibus within two minutes but a couple of others were still putting their shoes on and got on a couple of minutes later -- literally a further two minutes -- by which time he'd wandered off in a huff and came back at 11.15am, having done nothing other than presumably make a point about timeliness to us tardy hikers. So why not just herd us together at 10.55am?
All this meant we had quite a bitter taste in our mouths from our Top of Georgia hostel experience. The true irony was that for most of the morning, it was overcast but dry and just as we started hiking out of Dicks Creek Gap -- a time when the forecast said the weather was supposed to be clearing -- the skies began to darken and thunder reverberated around the hills.

There was a shelter just under four miles from Deep Gap and the rain was starting to get heavy just as I got to the turnoff. Sriracha had left his buff on the shelter signpost -- our tramily sign to say we'd taken the side trail -- so I headed in on the 0.3 mile side trail. 

Sweetblood also detoured to the hut soon after and we sheltered inside as the rain began to come down in a deluge unlike any we'd seen so far. It lasted at this pace for an hour, which is how it rains in the mountains in New Zealand but not like the five-minute downpours I'd encountered so far on the AT. There was a lot of lightning going on too, which made me doubly glad to be in shelter and off the top of the ridge.

The hut was one of the nicest so far, with a large mezzanine sleeping area and impressive mortice and tenon construction. I began to settle in, taking out my sleeping mat and sleeping bag and started reading someone's discarded 40-page fragment of To Kill a Mockingbird.

Towards the end of this deluge, Packaged Meat arrived and soon the reverberation of thunder was replaced by profanities directed at Sir Packsalot. 

Meat had asked to stay until early afternoon and agreed to sit outside on the bench to allow the hostel workers to clean the interior. At midday, Sir Packsalot announced he had to leave, which meant he was going over the top of the knoll before Deep Gap at the height of the thunderstorm. 

Although I thought he was not taking full responsibility -- Sir Packsalot might have kicked him out, but Meat had chosen to hike on in the storm rather than wait in the rain at a lower elevation -- but it was further confirmation that Top of Georgia had gained the notoriety of the worst hostel on the entire trail. 

About an hour later as the rain ebbed to a light drizzle, Sriracha and Sweetblood announced they were aiming to hike on to Tray Mountain shelter, about eight miles further on. I'd settled in at that point and kept reading my book but after two more hours, the remains of the rain had been replaced with glimpses of blue sky so I packed up and headed on too. Meat opted to hike further as well. 

The rest of the day was a bit of a blur, pushing on along an undulating ridge in an attempt to reach the shelter before being overtaken by darkness. Wait, didn't I already vow to retire night hiking from my repertoire? Twice? Including yesterday??

In truth this challenge made the next section fun when it might otherwise have been more of the long green (and now wet) tunnel. I hauled ass and made it just as the last light faded, announcing my arrival in the form of a question: ""It's not night hiking if you don't use a headlamp, right?""

Unlike Deep Gap shelter, this one was absolutely full to overflowing, with maybe half a dozen tents pitched nearby. Meat arrived soon after and because he'd sent home his tent a couple of towns back as a weightsaving measure, we had to squeeze up to make room. Hopefully he'll have learnt a lesson from this incident. Kids, don't do this!

Soon we'd eaten and were enjoying the usual Team KRT pre-sleep banter, with the final part of the evening being using Sweetblood's phone to play a Harry Potter audiobook for all of us. There's a single section hiker in the shelter with us and he's impressed by the obvious cameraderie of a cohesive tramily.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Can I count night hiking as my ""last time"" thing again, for the third time? There's only one more hostel left in the next 60 miles to Springer and we're not aiming to stop there, so I'm pretty sure that we've had our last hostel stay.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586061,"I tend to use my camera as a kind of diary, mostly taking pictures of natural beauty and tramily shenanigans but also some images that serve solely to remind me of matters of note on the trail even if I know that to anyone else the conditions will render the resulting photo as an unintelligible mess of pixels. 

I'm not sure what it says about today's damp hike along cloud-misted ridgelines that for the first time since leaving the Canadian border nearly five and a half months ago, I didn't take a single photo. 

(The photo accompanying today's entry is one I borrowed from earlier, although such is the unchanging nature of recent hiking in the long, green and misty tunnel, even I couldn't have told the difference.)

I didn't even realise this until the next day but in its own way, it showed what kind of day today was: a trudge in the rain rather than a highlight of walking from Maine to Georgia. 

Every thru-hike has days like this. On the PCT, nothing could compare to the southern Californian deserts and then the Sierra, which is why lots of hikers consider large tracts of Section O in northern California as a drag. The CDT had a few uninspiring days following jeep trails through rolling forested hills in Montana between sections on the actual divide but that's as bad as it got. I'd expected New Mexico to be mostly boring jeep trails and skanky water sources but its reputation turned out to be wildly overblown and for me, and most of those in my tramily, it turned out to be my favourite state. 
We'd heard plenty of stories about the AT of how the nobos have to walk through day after day of rain in the southern states, with a predictable result on the disillusionment and drop-out rate. Tadpole, one of my PCT companions, had hiked the AT in the superwet year of 2003, when they had 24 days in a row of rain. Afterwards, it was deemed to be a point of pride to have been in the Class of 2003, even if I suspect most of them didn't enjoy it much at the time -- definitely ""type two"" fun.
But I don't think we've had more than a dozen days of rain on the entire AT this year, let alone two dozen. It was yet more proof that going sobo seems to get all the tough stuff out of the way early on.

Just like on my mobile phone's memory card, not much of today stayed with me either. It didn't even rain that much, although it felt like it was about to for most of the day. Instead I trudged up hill and down hill, had lunch with Sweetblood at Blue Mountain shelter and finally squelched my way to Deep Gap shelter an hour or so before dark. (No night hiking = win!)

I arrived to find some kind of minor drama going on, with a local hiking group having lost one of their members and who was carrying the tent for his wife. While obviously their main concern was for the missing hiker, we also assured the wife that we'd make room for her so she'd have somewhere dry to sleep.

The group was camping nearby and after a couple of hours, the missing husband turned out to have blithely walked past the turnoff to the shelter and did a bonus 10 miles -- five miles out and then five miles back -- to end the drama in a happy manner.

I'm tempted to blame the rain on Packaged Meat's hubris-inviting decision to send home his tent a couple of weeks back. Once again, he had no option but to sleep in the shelter, which in turn meant some of the others in Team KRT had no option but to camp as the threat of rain turned to reality around dusk.

There were also a few section hikers around, including a couple of older guys who looked at us thru-hikers as if we were zoo animals, and a forest ranger from Alabama who is section-hiking the AT a week at a time and was the source of funniest deadpan life observations I'd heard in years.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: We're aiming to camp tomorrow, because the mileage suits our schedule to finish in three days, and the last night on trail will be at a church's covered picnic area where we've been told some 2017 nobos are organising trail magic for us sobos. It seems likely tonight will be our last night in an AT shelter.","Tray Mountain shelter
",Low Gap shelter,"Nov 08, Wed",15.40
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586153,"Blood Mountain definitely has a reputation on the AT, although that reputation tends to be diametrically opposite for nobos and sobos.

For nobos, who have not yet hiked 30 miles in total on the trail and are carrying too much stuff all while still getting their trail legs, Blood Mountain is the first really big hill on their way to Maine. One of the cruel corollaries of getting trail fit is that after the first day on trail, the pain gets worse for a week or so before it gets better. 

For us, though, Blood Mountain is barely consequential other than to remind us of the times back in Maine when we'd look on in wonder at nobos flying past on 30-mile days. Today's cruisy climb up the mountain is proof of just how far we've come, physiologically and geographically, since then.

We had a hint at the pain nobos are going through on and immediately after Blood Mountain when we hiked to Mountain Crossings, an outfitter and hostel at Neels Gap. This is the first place most nobos resupply on the trail and it's famous for the place for epic pack shakedowns, where people dump huge amounts of extraneous stuff in the hope of resurrecting their thru-hiking aspirations. Lots of disgruntled and defeated hikers also get off here.
Foot problems are also rife, which is why people don't just throw away their traitorous shoes but tie the laces together and hurl them over the boughs of a substantial tree directly outside Mountain Crossings. There must be well over 100 pairs of shoes on that tree.

It was still cold and damp when we arrived in late morning. Nine, who has been an on-again off-again member of the Second Breakfast Club, had fallen off the pace a little amid a series of health difficulties which would have ended almost anyone else's thru-hike. But she's clearly made of sterner stuff than almost anyone else out on the trail this year and stayed at the hostel here to wait for Packaged Meat so they could do the final miles to Springer together. They'd met because both were wannabe sobos from Ohio and did a bunch of training hikes together and headed into the 100 mile wilderness on the same day after us.

The difference between Mountain Crossings and Top of Georgia hostels couldn't be starker. For a start, all of Sir Packsalot's bleating about price gouging, my resupply here was still expensive but much cheaper than at Top of Georgia's store.

And the people working there couldn't be nicer, asking about our hikes and generally treating us like sentient human beings rather than walking wallets.
They weren't surprised at the amount of shade Sir Packsalot had been throwing their way but also had no wish to badmouth him back, preferring instead to pretend he didn't exist. That too said a lot about their character.
Nothing quite captured the difference more than their offer, because it was a cold-ass day, for us to enjoy the warmth of the hostel while the rest of Team KRT wandered in, even though we weren't staying. 

While we were waiting, some of the others realised there was a round the mountain trail that avoided having to climb Blood Mountain immediately after Neels Gap. When we headed off after lunch, only Dirt, 2am and I opted to head over Blood Mountain. 

The others are purists -- 2am doesn't even slackpack -- who want to see every white blaze, whereas I'm usually pragmatic about the merits of whether to take the official trail. There didn't seem to be much point climbing the mountain in the mist but after hearing so much about Blood Mountain for all these years, I wanted to experience it for myself.

And it was a viewless as expected and the route up the northern side was the epitome of indirect, veering around and through what seemed like every rock outcrop. The greasy conditions demanded care, since it would be a particularly invidious form of failure to end a thru-hike through injury just 30 miles from the end.

On the far side of the mountain, the AT improved markedly and featured a gently-graded descent on good trail. I couldn't help thinking: ""This is what causes nobos to complain so much?"" It's amazing what 2000+ miles of trail fitness can do.

We all reunited at a campground near a stream. The various hurricane remnants that have lashed the southern AT this season are particularly obvious here, with lots of downed trees, but there had been enough remediation work to render this campsite usable for all of us.

The rain seems to be clearing too, which is in keeping with a forecast for clear weather for the next two days and then a wet, wintery blast. But the plan is that we'll be off the trail by then...

Life is good.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586281,"Nobos are often the subject of scorn from us sobos. 

At first this is a derision born of envy because while we're still getting our trail legs in the wilds of Maine, they're cruising past and doing unimaginable daily mileages. There's a kind of equilibrium from the Bigelows through to Moosilauke at the southern end of the Whites, but from then on, nobos are subject to unbridled -- albeit often tongue-in-cheek and hopefully good-humoured -- mockery, and particularly whenever they have the temerity to bleat about trail difficulty.

But today, I will not stand to have a single word said against nobos! They are our trail siblings and we love them unconditionally!

This may or may not be because a bunch of nobos have travelled back to the trail from across the country specifically to pay forward the trail magic given to them by doing some for us, the Great Sobo Bubble of 2017. 

This is the upside of the way the Great Hiker Trash Trail Wedding tomorrow has bunched the various sobo groups together. The Second Breakfast Club came through here yesterday and our group of eight had originally planned to stop tonight at the shelter before Hickory Flats cemetery -- site of the trail magic -- because it would put us within a few hours of reaching Springer tomorrow.

We're glad we made it to here because Water Boy, Chilli Dog and a bunch of others have really put on something special, laying on hot food, beer and a huge fire at a church picnic site just off the trail at Hickory Flats. They seem like cool people, although none of us could remember crossing paths with them back in New England.
This wasn't even the only trail magic today. Because we're a couple of days away from finishing, family members who are coming to see their loved ones finish the trail have arrived a couple of days early and are doing what they can to help us.

Nine's father has driven up from Florida and has booked a room at the Amicalola Falls Lodge for all of us for the night after we finish. Today he met us at Woody Gap, providing the chance to dump some stuff we won't need again in the next 24 hours.

That's all we have left -- 24 hours. None of the stuff we dumped involved clothing because the corollary of the clear blue skies that greeted us this morning is that we also had cold-ass temperatures.

It seems now that we're finally left behind the vacillating between mild and cold the weather has done in the last few weeks. Now it's just cold all the time.

But the clear weather also meant there were views, which were also further improved because of the increasingly bare trees as autumn continues. 

I hiked mostly on my own this afternoon and rocked up to Hickory Flats to find most of the others already there, along with our kind hosts. Eventually the extended version of Team KRT -- me, Sriracha, Sweetblood, Dirt, 2am, OK, Happy Feet, Packaged Meat and Nine -- were united, along with Counsellor, another sobo we'd camped with last night.

I was very happy on this cold-ass day to see a roaring fire going, courtesy of Water Boy, Chilli Dog and their friends. They'd been following the progress of the sobo bubble and picked these few days as the best time to do trail magic, which was spot on. They must have helped 30 sobos over these days. 

The final night on trail is definitely different from any other. I remember it having a very valedictorian tone on the PCT, in part because for most of my then tramily, we were about to complete something that we'd originally considering simply inconceivable: a 2650-mile hike through some of the most beautiful country the US has to offer. Only Andy, who'd thru-hiked the AT but still hadn't managed to get a trail name on either trail, knew he could do this.

On the CDT, for reasons unknown it was the second last night that felt like the celebration. The final night was just five trail miles from the Mexican border, which we could see from our campsite under the stars.

Tonight here at Hickory Flats was different again, in part because we're with others rather camping as a tight tramily in the wilderness. Tomorrow we'll be done.

Life is good.

AT fact of the day: Last trail magic, last night on trail, last rainfall... We've now done 360/361ths of the trail, or 99.726%... I can finally safely say I won't night hike again because this is our last night. Our last night...","Lance Creek campground

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586356,"I'm hiking along an old forestry road beside Long Creek and it's been an increasingly disconcerting span of time since I last saw a white blaze. 

This is worrying, for matters of ego as much as of navigation, since I'm more than 2,184 miles into the Appalachian Trail and less than two hours from becoming a triple crowner. After avoiding nearly all navigational snafus on the AT so far, there is NO WAY I'm going to let myself get lost on the final five miles. 

I even keep looking around, thinking that being so close to the start of the trail would mean the marking for nobos would be exaggeratedly frequent and clear, but there's still nothing. I'm grateful that I'm using the Guthook app rather than the mapless AWOL AT guide because it means I can check what topography the trail is supposed to be going through. It concurs with the trail I'm following but it'd be nice to have a white blaze as confirmation.

Finally, after what must be more than a mile, there's a white blaze and my concerns evaporate but it's also a reminder of the need for vigilance, even though I'm so close to the end. Hubris, RT, hubris... 

Last night plunged down to temperatures that made me grateful that this is final time we'll sleep outside. Even this morning called upon element of my high-altitude mountaineering experience of how to get going when temperatures are below freezing. 

Today for the first time on the entire trip, I've kept my fleece on even after warming up, opting to go slowly to keep my temperature under control rather than strip back a layer. Although I'll admit that the paucity of white blazes along Long Creek also had me sweating, albeit for different reasons.

I'd left ahead of the others with the theory that it means we'll arrive at the southern terminus at Springer Mountain at about the same time but they certainly looking like they were in no hurry to leave -- and if there's one thing I know about Team KRT after 1200 miles, it's that they enjoy smelling the roses along the way.

 And after all, our only deadline today is the Sobo Hiker Wedding of Ash and Jay at the southern terminus at 3pm. 

All this meant I decided to go even slower than my non-sweating policy required, including a side trip into Stover Creek shelter. There was an AT maintenance crew training session going on here, so I had the chance to thank those who'd helped make the trail easy to hike (white blaze gaps notwithstanding) and who do so for future generations of thru-hikers. 

In time I returned to the trail and completed the climb up towards Springer Mountain, eventually stepping into the parking lot at the forest service road just 0.9 miles from the southern terminus. 

I saw Nine's dad sitting in his car and jumped in to enjoy much warmer conditions, thinking the others were still behind me, and it was only after chatting to him for 10 minutes or so that I realised that the others had already been through and were actually ahead of me.

Hubris, RT, hubris!

So I hauled up the gentle climb up to Springer Mountain and once the top was just in sight through some low shrubs, I pulled out Train's coconuts and clip-clopped my way up the final 50m to the others.

The end of any thru-hike is usually an anticlimax and so it was here. I'd been working towards this moment for five and a half months but just like life itself, thru-hiking is always about the journey rather than the destination. 

Team KRT gets it done: www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7mAHv...
2am's family was present and had managed to find some Lazy Hiker beer to celebrate the end of the trail and our newfound status as lazy non-hikers. Props to him: he'd done the official trail the whole way and, apart from the ascent of Katahdin, had eschewed all options to slackpack. His parents seemed unsure exactly what to make of the rest of us!

Sriracha and Sweetblood also had a bunch of friends from North Carolina who did the final 0.9 miles with them, bearing bottles of bubbly. And Ole Man, who we'd last seen at Woods Hole hostel, also turned up, which was a bit of a shock.

It was still pretty cold so after an hour or so on top, we wandered back to the parking lot, where Dirt's father was due to meet us. He'd driven over from his home in Alabama and brought trays of Subway sandwiches and beer, which we enjoyed as we sat around in the wan sunshine, soaking in the idea that we'd finished with the AT.

2am headed away with his family and Happy Feet also headed off on the long journey back to Maryland. We'd seen plenty of hikers go over the last five and a half months and it was always with the knowledge that our paths might cross again. The oddest thing about finishing is that the realistic option is that we won't cross paths by chance.

The rest of Team KRT were keen to attend Ash and Jay's reception down in the valley tonight but had been a little ambivalent about being present for their actual wedding at the southern terminus. I'd been keen on both, thinking it was an appropritately epic and memorable way to finish an epic hike and, through dint of inertia, we were still hanging around the car park when 2pm rolled around and the first of the wedding guests started arriving. This was enough to swing the momentum towards the rest of us attending the wedding.

The members of the Second Breakfast Club had finished yesterday and looked disconcertingly clean, wearing suits or elegant dresses, while people like Beast were sporting haircuts and trimmed beards. Three Goldilocks and the Bear, who'd finished with them yesterday, also reappeared in polite attire. We, of course, looked like the dirty homeless hikers we'd been until about an hour before.

We rocked back up the 0.9 miles to the southern terminus for the wedding, which because of some essential car breakdown, ended up starting an hour late -- remarkably good considering the logistical challenges involved.

It was a humbling event. Ash's brother David, who'd done the thru-hike with them, gave a stirring speech and it was just nice to be around a really cool couple who together are more than the sum of their parts. 

And if they can survive thru-hiking the AT, marriage should be a breeze!

So we made our way back to the road, where we drove back to Amicalola Falls Lodge, where Nine's dad had booked a room big enough for everyone who remained from Team KRT. Soon we'd showered and changed into the least manky clothes we possessed, which is about as glam as we were capable of getting.

We then made our way to the wedding reception, which was a fun affair in which we had the chance to celebrate with about 30 of those around whom we'd hiked for around five months. The feeling of being around those completing their first thru hike was something worth bottling, although our main focus tended to be on unbottling...

AT fact of the day: The ""last time"" moment of the day? Everything.","Hickory Flats cemetery
",Springer Mountain,"Nov 11, Sat",6.30
Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586452,"The cold rain that was lashing Amicalola Falls Lodge when we woke up today is reason enough to think the timing of our hike has been extraordinarily fortunate. 

Yesterday's surreal and epic hiker trash wedding and the bacchanalian reception that followed wouldn't have been the same today. We felt for Boss, Sweets and Bangles, who are scheduled to reach Springer Mountain a day behind us but in conditions best described as an exercise in suffering. 
In its way, that's a handy metaphor for the trail as a whole.
The others in Team KRT became accustomed to the tone of my, er, observations about the AT and particularly its habit of choosing routes that added unnecessary and pointless difficulty.

""Don't mind him,"" they'd say to others we met, ""he hates the AT.""

Can I say in my defence I really tried to like it? When it was taking a toll on my body early on, I slowed down in the hope of making hiking the AT more enjoyable. Whenever I had the chance to make the hike easier, I tried to take it up in the hope of engendering a more positive impression of it. 

But...

Maybe the best description I heard came from Crispi, a hiker from Texas who did an seven-month nobo thru-hike on the AT last year that involved a lot of partying. I met her this year while I was trail angelling at Scout and Frodo's place in San Diego before she set off on the PCT, less than six months after reaching Katahdin. I met her again a month later while I was trail angelling at the Andersons, at mile 478, at which time she was able to more meaningfully compare the two experiences. 

""Oh man, it's been different -- this is so much more enjoyable,"" she explained. 

""But [the AT and the PCT] are different animals. The AT will always be my first love, but you're not always meant to be with your first love.""

(A slightly fuller version of her take can be found on my Humans of the PCT17 page here: www.facebook.com/Humans.of.PCT... )

As the motto of my journal says, I expected the AT would involve having to ""embrace the civility"", a play on the unofficial CDT motto of embrace the brutality. I'd thought the frequent towns and hostels and the whole hiker-support ecosystem on the AT would make it a more civilised affair, despite its notorious reputation for PUDs -- pointless ups and downs.

But that meant-in-jest slogan came back to haunt me because the AT felt like the most consistently brutal of the three trails, although in terms of short-term arduousness, nothing will beat doing the Sierra in the high-snow year of 2006. 

And as Crispi rightly observed, they are different beasts. And the AT doesn't have that special place of being my first love. That's the PCT for a whole range of reasons, only some of which are to do with the trail.

The triple crown is not something to which I ascribe any importance, although I admire those who have done it. If the CDT in New Mexico had proved to be as meritless as its dire reputation had it, I'd planned to get off the trail. (Like most trail tales, the ""boring jeep roads and skanky water"" rep was vastly overblown and it ended up being my favourite state.) And if the AT had truly sucked, I'd have got off it too.
It never reached that stage. But equally, there was no moment -- unlike on the PCT and the CDT -- when I felt like I wanted this experience to go on and on. 

I'm writing this five months to the day after heading back from Amicalola Falls Lodge to the real world. As I'd said when I decided to hike the AT, any thru-hike has to be good. And this one was.

Rolling Thunder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586544,"Hike Your Own Hike is a motto I try to live by. But HYOH is not the only aphorism that guides me, and another is about not reinventing the wheel. 

On the AT and on all my previous trails, I hiked my own hike but I also made a point of listening to the advice from those who had gone before, adopting the bits that worked for me and discarding the bits that didn’t. 

In that sense, I’ve hiked a bunch of different people’s hikes.

It's in this spirit that I've compiled the following tips for those thinking about a sobo AT hike. It's certainly possible to yell ""F... you, RT!"", ignore every one of these and successfully hike the AT, but I think for most mortals -- and particularly those on their first thru-hike -- some of these will help make trail life a little more enjoyable. Or at least lessen the fear factor ahead of time.

Accept that going sobo is tough! The single toughest day on the entire AT for sobos is the very first one, and apart from a few cruisy days at the start of the 100 mile wilderness (which don't feel all that cruisy because you're still getting your trail legs), it doesn't really start getting easier until after Moosilauke at the end of the Whites. I found the AT more physically arduous overall than either the PCT or the CDT. Combine that with the classic beginner thru-hiker mistake of going out too hard, too fast and you have the number one reason why people get off the trail through being injured or disheartened in the first six weeks. While it's important to keep the miles ticking over -- say, at least one shelter per day -- the primary goals for the first 500 miles are to keep your feet, knees and the rest of your body in good shape and to make sure you're enjoying the trail. Once you're past the Whites, you can start cranking the miles. You have time! This seques to the next point:

Sobo on the AT is the only direction in the triple crown that doesn't get stopped by winter: Katahdin closes in late October, if you're lucky, and blizzards in both directions on the PCT and CDT can force hikers to abandon their thru-hikes, which is a powerful incentive to put in the miles. But AT sobo? It gets pretty cold from mid-November on but every year, early nobos meet late-running sobos finishing their hikes in February or even later. You have time, which allows you the luxury of making sure you keep enjoying the hike. I deliberately slowed down after Monson because the trail was so tough and I wasn't enjoying it as much as I wanted to. Enjoying yourself is one of the biggest predictors of a successful thru-hike, which in turn seques into...

Have fun! Never forget this. So often we’d see people -- particularly the frontrunning nobos, who were hitting the toughest terrain and corresponding lowered mileages just as they really wanted to be done with the trail -- who were treating the hike as if it was a hair shirt, to be endured rather than enjoyed. If it gets really bad, slow down. If it's still bad, take some time off. The trail will still be there in a week’s time. Your job is to make sure you are too.

Don't believe all the hype about the Whites: As I came out at Rangely after the toughest bit of the AT yet -- for the first time on the trail, the nobos even gave us fleeting respect for completing it -- I met a guy who was clearly an experienced thru-hiker with a tiny pack. He turned out to be a PCT alumni so I figured he'd have a realistic view on the Whites compared to the apocalyptic warnings we'd been hearing. ""I've done some hiking, man, but the Whites?"" he told us, pausing for dramatic effect before adding simply: ""F...!"" After the Mahoosucs, I was concerned about the Whites -- and of course it was not nearly as bad as claimed, mostly because the quality of the trails was way better than the bog/cliff duopoly of the Mahoosucs. Of course there are good reasons to treat the Whites with respect and caution -- and it's why it's the site of two of only three places on the AT where I was prepared to wait for good weather: Katahdin, the Presidential range and Franconia Ridge -- but it's not as bad as the fearmongerers say.

South of the Whites, nobos are wrong about everything... The first nobos we met were pulling 30s in the 100 mile wilderness and seemed like some kind of superspecies who bore little relation to us mortals. But after the Whites, we'd hear nobos complaining genuinely about the trail they'd just done and then we'd find it was easy compared to what we'd come through. ""Vermud"" -- the nobo nickname for Vermont -- exemplified this, in which one nobo earnestly told us about how the mud had come over the top of his shoe, seemingly unaware that one of those he was telling this to was a sobo hiker who'd gone up to her waist in a bog in the Mahoosucs. We started taking any well-intentioned trail tips they gave us with a large grain of salt (although they were kinda right about ""Rocksylvania"").

...except about food and hostels: Nobos were great for this. They always had the most up to date info about the great restaurants and places to stay, including new places that had opened and places that sucked. *COUGH*TopOfGeorgiaHostel*COUGH* A good test is how many states in advance somewhere is recommended. For example, we'd been hearing glowing reports about the Home Place in Virginia from nobos all the way back in Maine, 10 states earlier, and it lived up to the hype.
The Long Green Tunnel stereotype is real: Especially once you're out of New England, long sections of the AT are a green tunnel without views and often following long, flat, forested ridges that go on and on and on and on. And on. Just accept that some days will suck, particularly in the mid-Atlantics. Sometimes it’s what’s going on inside that makes the miles drag by. Take it easy on yourself, crank up your music/podcast and accept that sometimes the miles just have to be done rather than savoured or even enjoyed. 

Take zero-days – and especially on-trail zeroes – and make sure they’re real zero days: It took about half of my first thru-hike before we realised how important it was for zero days to be real zero days to be beneficial. Often we’d do all the town chores and ended up feeling like we needed to get back on the trail to have a break. On the second half, we’d rush around like mad on the first evening to do all the chores and then schedule nothing for the next day other than watching bad TV, eating town food and drinking beer. And an on-trail zero day – as we did in a shelter when a severe storm blew through in North Carolina – was worth its weight in pizza vouchers.

Be patient about getting a trail name: One of the mottos of thru-hiking is ""the trail will provide"", and that also applies to trail names. About a third of people I met had named themselves, which isn't in the spirit of the trail, while others had jumped on the first trail name that was suggested, only to regret it later when the perfect trail name emerged. I understand the concerns about doing something stupid that gets you a trail name you regret, but a trail name has to be accepted and only really sticks when you reply to it. The best trail names are clever and involve an awesome story, which kinda rules out names like ""Not Yet"" and ""Just [Real first name]"". Be patient and let the trail provide. You will be rewarded.

Accept that re-entry may be tough: Give yourself time and space to get back to normal life again. One theme that came up again and again for most hikers is that the hike was a point of transition in their lives, either due to events of their making or due to things that happen to them. And often when you finish the hike and head back home, the things that were in action before are still there. Cut yourself some slack and allow yourself time to ease back in. Struggling with re-entry is the norm. Fortunately you can overcome this with a 12 million step programme, otherwise known as the triple crown.

Or you can ignore all of these suggestions. You'll work it out and find your own path.

Always remember that life is good.
