Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552006,"I added my name to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's thru hiker registry today, so I guess it's official. My Flip Flop hike will start from Davenport Gap, NC on March 25, 2017 and head north to Katahdin before jumping back to Davenport Gap and heading south to Springer.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Wed",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552128,"I first started dreaming about thru hiking the AT when I heard about it as a teenager; however, it was always one of those ""someday"" dreams pushed to the background as my life was occupied with such things as building a career and raising kids. Blogging for my brother (All In) on TrailJournals when he hiked the trail in 2011 rekindled the glowing embers of the banked coals of my long dormant dream; however, when I picked up a hitching thru hiker (Patriot) near the Mt Rogers Visitor Center the next year, the embers flared up into full flame. After telling my wife about the encounter when I got back to our home in West Virginia, she said, ""I think you should do it"". It took another five years to reach a point where I could realize my dream and actually attempt a thru hike. During those years I started reading TrailJournals entries from other thru hikers (my all time favorite TJ blogger is CoMOMdo of the Florida Flip Floppers - check it out) and reading books about all aspects of a thru hike. I have been a backpacker all my adult life (hey, when you live someplace as special as WV - how can you NOT hike?) and have hiked portions of the AT in Virginia and Tennessee; however, they've always been shorter hikes of 2-4 days in duration. This was a whole new beast which would require a lot more planning and research!",,View Entry,"Dec 04, Sun",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552412,"My current plan is to start at Davenport Gap, NC on March 25 and head north. When I reach Mt Katahdin, I will secure some as yet undetermined means of conveyance to get me back to Davenport Gap and hike south to Springer Mt. (this plan is subject to change depending upon the outcome of a developing situation at work). For all you non-hikers out there, this is known as a Flip-Flop hike. The vast majority of thru hikers start at Springer Mt, GA in Mar/Apr and hike north to Mt Katahdin, ME. A few start in the North in Jun/Jul and hike south and even fewer still start somewhere in the middle (most often Harpers Ferry, WV) in Apr/May and hike north to Katahdin (Flip) and then jump back to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Springer (Flop).My plan had always been to do a ""traditional"" Flip Flop from Harpers Ferry. This was attractive for several reasons. First, it is the closest access point to the AT from my home in Morgantown, WV. Second, it kept me out of the overwhelming crush of hikers starting from Springer between Mar 1 and Apr 1 (known fondly as the Bubble). Third, it allowed me to miss winter weather in the Smokies. Fourth, it allowed me to experience both the comraderie of a northbound hike with all the NOBOs and the more solitary nature of a southbound hike with much fewer SOBOs on the trail as I headed south. Finally, it allowed me to start my hike as part of the 3rd Annual Flip Flop Festival at the AT Headquarters in Harpers Ferry (having already attended the 1st and 2nd Annual Festivals). Unfortunately, real life interfered with my ideal hiking plan and I found myself hemmed in at both ends by non-hiking events that required me to start my hike no earlier than Mar 25 and finish no later that Sep 16. These time constraints would have put me in Vermont at the height of mud season if I started that early from HF and in the broiling heat of VA in July for the second half of my hike, neither of which was too appealing.Still wishing to avoid all the problems associated the overcrowded trail conditions resulting from the Bubble by starting from Springer on Mar 25, I consulted with the wise and all-knowing Laurie Potteiger of the AT Conservancy. We studied the map and looked at my start- and end-date requirements and determined that a modified Flip Flop starting at the northern terminus of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park at Davenport Gap would best fit my needs. This would put me ahead of the Bubble, allow me to miss butt-deep snow in the Smokies and would still provide me with a piece of the solitary SOBO hike when I Flopped to Davenport Gap in late summer to finish out the hike. So, that's where the plan now stands. Only, just last week a new development cropped up at work that may throw this whole plan out the window. But, that's for another installment...",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Mon",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552618,"On December 12, my employer announced a Voluntary Separation Program to reduce headcount. Interested employees were requested to apply for the VSP and Management would determine, based on whatever arcane formulae they used to determine headcount reduction needs versus employee skillset needs, what employees qualified for the VSP. On December 21, my wife (who works for the same employer) and I found out that we qualified for the VSP. Woo hoo! Our last day of employment is January 11; however, we will continue to receive pay and health benefits for several more months. So, in effect, my employer will pay me to hike the AT! Merry Christmas to me! And a Happy New Year!I had previously planned to start my thru hike on March 25 because I planned to continue working until our company's annual bonus payout in mid-March. Now, with the VSP, I can start the hike in late February (on or about the 25th) from Amicalola Falls and get out ahead of the Bubble. I am currently re-evaluating my equipment choices to determine what changes I need to make to account for the earlier start date (I hope to post my gear list soon). Having previously been caught in an early April blizzard in the Smokies on a section hike several years ago, I know that Winter is not done with this area for several weeks to come. One thing that will need some adjusting is my shelter. I plan to carry a Jacks R Better Bear Mountain Bridge Hammock. With the earlier start date, I will need to add an underquilt and underquilt protector for added warmth. This, of course, adds to the weight of my pack. What can I remove from the the pack to help compensate for the added weight? Hmm, decisions...decisions... I suspect I'm going to be busy in the New Year reworking my pack!

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553156,"There are a ton of books out there that can teach you the mechanics of preparing for and completing a thru hike. I only know of one book, called Appalachian Trials, that addresses the psychology of thru hiking. In it, author Zack Davis states that one of the things you need to do is publicly state your intention. That way, in those low times when thoughts of quitting cross your mind, you will think of everyone who is following your hike and, rather than disappoint them, or maybe just to save face, you keep on hiking. Pretty soon things turn around, the rain stops, the sun comes out, and you wonder why you ever thought about quitting in the first place. Well, let me tell you, even though I hadn't really planned it, I have definitely publicly stated my intentions! When word of my Voluntary Separation from my employer got out, people started asking me what I planned to do. My thru hike seems to have struck a chord with everyone! I think everyone who is not taking the package sees this as a romantic adventure and an escape from the hum drum life of a laboratory. Tomorrow is my last day - all that's left now is the exit interview and turning in my company ID. After some traveling to visit kids and grandsons and some long overdue painting around the house, I will be hitting the approach trail at Amicalola Falls on February 26 (my 53rd birthday!). I have been doing preparation hikes with full pack in nearby Cooper's Rock State Forest. Last week, it was 16 deg F and 6 inches of snow. I am pretty happy with my chosen gear and feel pretty good about my readiness for winter in the southern Appalachians. Not ultralight by any means, but not too bad weightwise. Definitely better than what I carried in the 80s and 90s! Just a few more tweaks...",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Tue",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554086,"I worked my last event yesterday at Monongalia EMS. So, now I am no longer working as either a scientist or a medic and I am now officially completely unemployed (at least for the next six months or so). Of course, I have been able to fill my days with LOTS of painting. My wife, Marguerite, is completely on-board with me taking the next 5-6 months to hike on the AT; however, she did have two stipulations: (1) I would carry and use my shiny new SPOT Tracker she got me for Christmas and (2) I would help her paint all of the rooms in the house that I have been meaning to paint for the last 8 years or so before I left. Eight years of painting compressed into about 3 weeks is a lot of painting. At least it has kept me from obsessing about trail planning.Although not obsessing, I have continued to make changes to my gear, even as my start date creeps under the one month mark. I just wasn't happy with my winter pack weight. Total pack weight with water and food was still over 30 lbs. So, after much soul searching and internal debate, I have decided to start the hike with a Zpacks Altaplex tent rather than my Jacks R Better Bear Mountain Bridge Hammock, allowing me to shed the additional weight of a suspension system, full tarp, underquilt, UQ cover, and spreader bars. Although I much prefer my hammock to sleeping on the cold, hard ground, dropping the extra weight will take some of the stress off of the titanium plate on my right clavicle (the result of sailing over the handlebars of my mountain bike several years ago). Once I shed the winter gear, I plan to return the hammock to my pack until I reach the Whites in NH, at which time I plan to switch back to the Altaplex.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Thu",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555155,"I am spending the night at my stepson's house in Knoxville, TN. Then tomorrow Chris is taking me to Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia to start my thru hike. I plan to do the Approach Trail tomorrow and actually reach Springer Mountain Monday morning for the official start of my thru hike. This has been a dream whose realization has been a long time coming. This never would have happened if my wife, Marguerite, had not been so understanding and supportive and actually encouraged me to give this hike a try. On my way here, I passed where the AT crosses under I-81 in SW Virginia. I couldn't resist stopping to take a photo of the iconic white blazes.",,On your mark...get set...,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555226,"Today was a really great start to my AT adventure. Chris and l arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park around noon and I registered as AT thru hiker #230 for the 2017 season. The weather was spectacular! Blue skies and   temps in the high 50s. Chris and I then passed through the arch behind the visitor's center and started up the 8.8 mile approach trail to Springer Mt and the start of the AT. The first thing you hit is a set of 650 steps that parallels Amicalola Falls. Ugh! At the top of the steps, Chris and I parted ways and I continued along the approach trail. The previously busy trail got very quiet after I got away from the tourist attractions. I took this opportunity to put on my hiking kilt since I was no longer in danger of mooning all of north Georgia as would have happened if I climbed the steps in my kilt. Over the next 7 miles I did see a lot of day hikers. I also passed a few thru hikers as we struggled our way up to the long climb to Springer. It's kind of funny, we are all kind of tentative. We don't want to sound overly boastful and proclaim loudly the we are going all the way to Maine! We also surreptitiously check out each other's packs trying to determine if they know more about what they are doing than we do. After climbing and climbing and climbing for 7.4 miles I finally reached Black Gap shelter. I had planned to stop there for the night rather than push on to Springer Mt; however, when I got there I was the only person there and I still had over two hours of daylight. So, I decided to push on to Springer. What a great decision! When I reached Springer there were 8 other people enjoying the setting sun. Everyone was sort of keeping to themselves and almost shy. I decided that would never do and started introductions. It turns out we had people from FL, NH, NY, Philly, Paris, and South Africa! We all then proceeded to the shelter together and had a nice evening filtering water, fixing dinner, and figuring out the bear cables (cables that suspend your food in the air out of reach of bears). It is now 8 pm (hiker midnight) and we are all tucked in our sleeping bags in the shelter or our tents and ready for bed. All in all, a great day!","Amicalola Falls

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555319,"Hawk Mt Tent Site 2 /27/17Today was another good day on the trail. I awoke to overcast skies and the feel of rain in the air. It was a pretty cold night and I discovered that my 20 degree rated down quilt wasn't quite as warm as I'd hoped. Tonight, more layers of clothes. Once again, I kept the mileage low as I build up my hiker legs. As a result I had a leisurely morning and didn't leave camp until almost 10 AM. I saw several more hikers starting from Springer Mt this morning, having decided to forego the Approach Trail. The range of hikers is fairly amazing. I had three twenty-somethings blow by me like I was standing still. Come to think of it, I was standing still taking a water break when they passed; but you know what I mean. Not five minutes later, I met a woman heading southbound. The first thing she said to me was ""I'm going home. I've hiked five miles and my feet hurt, my toes are tingling, and I'm hallucinating that the creek is talking to me."" I'm not making this up! Of course, she had a pack as big as she was. I'm amazed by the number of people who have an overly romantic view of hiking the AT and come out here with no idea what they are getting into only to quit a few miles into the hike. After a nice lunch near a waterfall, the rain arrived. Rain. Lifebringer to a parched land crying for water... The tears of the Angels come down from Heaven to water the little flowers... I hate rain. Luckily, I was able to ride out the worst of the high winds and lashing rain at a pavilion that the Bethel Baptist Church generously makes available for thru hikers. After the rain passed, I hiked on to the Hawk Mt Tent Site. This site just opened this season in an attempt to relieve the overcrowding at the Hawk Mt Shelter that occurs every year when the crush of hikers known as the Bubble arrives. Luckily, my plan to get out ahead of the Bubble has been successful. There are quite a few hikers out here; but, it isn't overwhelming yet.","Springer Mt shelter

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555351,"2/28/17 Woody Gap,GAMiles hiked: 20.6 Miles left: 2169.7Rain. Again. Lots of rain. Everything is damp. Yuck. The day started out nice. I woke up at 6 AM just as it was getting light. A fog had settled in overnight and the woods had that really cool, mysterious look to them. It has been a bit of an issue adjusting my sleep schedule. I climb in my tent when it gets dark and I read or write my blog and generally fall asleep by 9 pm or so. Of course, being one of those people who only sleeps about 5 hrs a night, I am wide awake by about 3 am. So, by 6 am when it starts getting light I'm more than ready to get up. I am also one of those people who can't just hang out very well, so by 8 am I was ready to head out. I started out hiking this morning with a 20 Something named Alexa. We were hiking along at a good clip and having a pleasant conversation. Then we reached the first climb of the day. I told her to go ahead since she would probably be faster than me on the climb. Well, that took care of hiking with Alexa! She was gone! I had a couple of pretty steep climbs today. But the trail is so nice and well maintained it wasn't too bad. Volunteers from the GA AT Club maintain this section of the trail and they do an excellent job. I also met two Ridge Runners. They are people who patrol sections of the trail and answer hiker questions and help educate hikers about Leave No Trace and hiker etiquette. I truly appreciate the work these people do to make this trip possible. Of course, by leaving so early, I reached my planned stopping point at Gooch Mt shelter by 1 pm, which was way too early to stop for the day. So, on the third day of my hike I broke my rule of no 10+ miles in the first week and pushed on to Woody Gap. Alexa was also at Gooch Mt Shelter when I arrived and we discussed pushing on a little further. She headed out while I was packing up my lunch and I haven't seen her since. About 2 pm the rain arrived, heralded in by several rounds of thunder. I quickly donned my Goretex jacket and my rain kilt and covered my pack just before the skies opened up. The problem with hiking in a Goretex jacket is that it keeps the rain out; however, you get just as wet from sweating. I slogged on and finally arrived at Woody Gap in the pouring rain. There is a hiker hostel nearby that will pick up hikers and shuttle them to the hostel for the night. I decided it would be nice to get out of the rain, so I called them. Totally booked for the night! Bummer. I guess it's tenting in the rain for me. About that time, another hiker I had met, Ant Man, showed up. We found a suitable tent site and pitched our tents in the rain and have settled in for the night. Unfortunately, the Weather Channel is predicting severe thunderstorms tomorrow. Bummer.","Hawk Mt Tent Site

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555426,"3/1/17 Blood Mt Cabins, Neel Gap, GAMiles Hiked: 31.4 Miles to go: 2158.4Another good day on the trail, after a miserable night. It poured all night. I stayed relatively dry; however, everything was damp. Even worse, my air mattress has sprung a leak! So, I ended up on the hard ground in a damp tent. A long night to say the least. Antman and I woke up to rain. So, we quickly packed up and headed out. Rumor on the trail was that strong thunderstorms were on the way today. So, I called Marguerite and asked her to call Blood Mt Cabins when they opened and make a reservation for tonight. Luckily, the rains let up; however, the fog and blustery winds continued. I know I have complained a lot about the rain; however, I do realize that we need the rain to fill the streams and springs. Today, we climbed over our first 4000 footer. Blood Mountain, 4457 ft, was a brutal climb. I understand it takes about 3 weeks to get your hiker legs. I guess it doesn't happen magically. It's crossing mountains like Blood Mt that does it. You know what they say - ""No rain, no pain, no Maine.""Blood Mt wasn't as steep as yesterday's Sassafras Mt, but it went on forever! I climbed it with a young woman named Courtney. Even though we didn't talk all the way up the mountain, it was nice to climb it with someone else. A funny thing about hiking is you feel like you are the only person out there; but, in reality, you have people all around you. Throughout the day, you pass people and people pass you. Blood Mt is known for its incredible views. Didn't see 'em! At the top - nothing but clouds. And a Chinese hiking group getting ready to have a picnic. I briefly considered trying out my Yogiing skills (as the name implies, that's when a thru hiker engages a picnicer in conversation in hopes they will offer you food); but, I wasn't really hungry and I wanted to get off the mountain before the skies opened up. Where the ascent of Blood Mt was fairly brutal, the descent was treacherous. The pathway is so overused that it has been eroded down to the bedrock in places (anyone who has hiked Dolly Sods Wilderness in WV understands what I mean). As a result, the wet rocks were slick. I had a couple scary slips, but managed not to fall. As I got down lower on Blood Mt, I came out of the clouds, the wind calmed down and the trail calmed down. The walk into Neel Gap was actually quite serene and pleasant. Neel Gap is the first major road crossing northbounders (NOBOs) reach. It is also where Mountain Crossings, which is a cool outdoor store, and Blood Mountain Cabins are located. When I arrived at Mountain Crossings, Courtney, who had left me behind on the descent of Blood Mt, and Alexa (remember her? She left me behind climbing a mountain yesterday.) were on the porch talking to Antman. So, we invited them to join us at the cabin. Blood Mountain Cabins are great! I highly recommend them to anyone coming this way. Laundry is included in the cost of the cabin. We all spread out our wet gear to dry and collected up our clothes to be laundered, took showers, and worked on repairing gear. The cabin looks like an REI store exploded. Around 5:30 pm the Heavens literally ripped open. Thunder, lightning, high winds, pelting rain. We were all sitting in a warm, dry cabin thanking my dear wife, Marguerite, for making arrangements for us so we weren't stuck out in the maelstrom. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Mr Mule, a hiker I had met a couple days ago, was standing on the porch looking like a drowned rat. He asked, ""Is there room on your floor for a tired hiker?"" He went on to tell us he had taken a nasty fall coming down Blood Mt (in fact, after getting bloodied on Blood Mt, we convinced him to change his trail name to Blood Mountain). Of course, we couldn't turn him away! So, here we all are sitting around laughing and joking like old friends. Tomorrow it's supposed to be sunny! I expect another good day.
By the way, thanks to everyone who has posted to my guestbook. I have not been able to respond to everyone due to limited battery life on my phone. But, know that I have read and appreciated every comment. They really make my day.","Woody Gap stealth site

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555478,"3/2/17 Low Gap, GAMiles hiked: 42.9 Miles to go: 2146.9Sunshine! Glorious sunshine! We woke up to a beautiful, blustery day with full sunshine and temps in the 30s. Blood Mt (the man, not the mountain) and I decided to have a hot breakfast at the Blood Mt Cabins lodge. He insisted on buying my breakfast since we were so kind as to take him in last night. Antman, Alexa, and Courtney decided to head on out. After breakfast I arranged with the owner to borrow a galvanized wash tub in an effort to find the leak in my sleeping pad (fill the tub with water, put the air mattress underwater, squeeze and watch for bubbles). All I managed to do was freeze my hands. I decided to go to Mountain Crossings and buy a new sleeping pad and resupply food for the next four days. Blood Mt stayed behind to get his clothes laundered since he arrived too late yesterday to get them done. After resupplying and shipping a few items home, I headed out. It was a great day hiking. A little on the blustery side; but, I was wearing sunglasses! Today's hike wasn't too bad. Only one big climb. The rest was undulating along ridge lines. I passed several people and was passed by several people. The Twenty Somethings are interesting. They all put in earbuds, put their heads down, and fly up the trail. I move slower, listening to the forest and taking in the views. I also talk. As anyone who knows me will tell you, I like to talk. I talk to other thru hikers, I talk to dayhikers, I talk to Ridgerunners. Rocks... Trees... In fact, the day before yesterday, I stopped to talk to a hunting dog coming down Sassafras Mt. He was one of those hound dogs they use for bear hunting. As he came trotting along the trail, I noticed that he was wearing a GPS collar so his owner could track him. I could also see down to the road and could see a pickup truck driving along and the owner was hollering for the dog. I said, ""You know they're looking for you."" He just grinned and said, ""Shh"" and trotted off into the woods. I went on my way, too. I figured I didn't have any dog in that fight. Anyway, as a result of my talking to everyone, I never caught up with Antman, Alexa, and Courtney. I experienced my first trail magic today. Trail magic is when something unexpected happens along the trail, usually at a time when you need it most. Trail magic is usually performed by nice people, known as Trail Angels, who go out of their way to do nice things for thru hikers. In the last few years, it has sort of become associated with people providing food to thru hikers and, unfortunately, many hikers have almost come to expect trail magic like they are entitled to it because they are thru hikers. Now don't get me wrong, if someone offers me food, I'm not going to turn it down. I just hate that sense of entitlement that seems to have grown in my the past few years among many thru hikers. In my particular case, I was running low on water coming out of Hogpen Gap. I knew it was several more miles to the next reliable water source, so I was trying to conserve. Luckily, some nice Trail Angel had left jugs of water beside the trail. Yay. I arrived at Low Gap Shelter, where we all had agreed to stop for the night, to find a major tent city. Everyone had pushed into Neel Gap yesterday to avoid the storm. As a result, we all ended up at Low Gap Shelter today. The shelters are three sided structures that sleep 6-12 people; spaced every 7-10 miles apart or so, and generally have water, bear cables, and a privy. So, people tend to hike shelter to shelter. There must be 30-40 people here. Courtney was here; but, no sign of Antman or Alexa. I checked the shelter register and they had left us a note saying they were pushing on a few miles. Courtney and I decided that we had hiked enough for the day and went looking for a flat spot to put our tents. We found a spot and set up our tents near Alex, his dad Jerome, and their dog Springer. Just as it began to get dark, Blood Mt arrived and joined us. Tomorrow promises to be another pretty day.","Neel Gap, GA

Miles hiked: 52.6 Miles to go: 2137.2
Ok, so it's day six of the thru hike and I am under a roof. Again. Blood Mt and I are sharing a room at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA. Yeah, I know that it was only two days ago that I was in a cabin; but, I have an excuse. Last night was very cold and blustery. Popcorn's digital thermometer said it got down to 27 F. It turns out that my down hiking quilt, which is rated for 20 F, wasn't quite up to the task. Even wearing all my clothes, I was very cold. I lay there shivering all night. See, I prefer a quilt to a sleeping bag because I just can't get comfortable on the ground, so I spin all night like a rotisserie chicken. So, I end up tied up in a sleeping bag. Actually, I prefer a hammock to a tent to get me off the ground; but, a hammock decked out for winter, with a top quilt and an underquilt, and tarp is just more weight than I want to carry. Anyway, after spinning and shivering for several hours, I finally looked at my phone in the hopes that it was almost morning. 11:58 pm!? It was a long night...
We awoke to another clear and blustery day. Sunshine and temps in the high 30s. I was planning a longer day because of the way the shelters were spaced out. Courtney, who also had had a cold night, and whose feet were hurting, and who was expecting a package, planned to come to Hiawassee. Blood Mt didn't think he was up to hiking 15 miles and was thinking Hiawassee sounded pretty good. Antman and Alexa had already flown ahead. So, it looked like the end of our little group. Blood Mt and I exchanged contact info as we headed out because I hike at a faster pace than him and planned to go farther on ahead. 
The section from Low Gap to Unicoi Gap was very nice and I hiked much faster than I expected. At one point I overtook another hiker named Not Fade Away. He asked if he could take my picture because he was taking pictures of the ""characters"" he met on the trail. I wasn't quite sure I liked the sound of that, so I asked him to snap a picture of me with my phone in hopes of seeing this character he saw. I still don't get it. As you can see, it's just me in a kilt with a ponytail, bushy white beard, and a funny red hat, carrying a hiking staff. Whatever. 
When I had phone signal at Unicoi Gap, I called Marguerite and told of my night and that I might need to change out my quilt for my warmer sleeping bag, especially since the Smokies, with mountains in excess of 6000 ft, still lay ahead. Since we were heading into the weekend, I didn't think there was any way to get a package to me in Hiawassee before Monday or Tuesday (I sure didn't want to hang out in town a couple days waiting for it) and the next town was a few days away. Marguerite worried about me being cold for several days. So, in typical Marguerite fashion, she sprung into action. She suggested I get a room in Hiawassee and she would Fed Ex it to me overnight. I went ahead and made arrangements at a hiker-friendly motel called the Budget Inn for me and Blood Mt and arranged for the shuttle to pick us up at 3:00 pm and sat down to wait for Blood Mt. When he arrived at Unicoi Gap he was most happy to see me and have a room waiting for him in Hiawassee. 
The man at the Budget Inn had told us to watch for the blue and white shuttle van. I know what you're thinking - what kind of van would a place like Budget Inn, where the rooms are $45/night, have? And you'd be exactly right. This thing appeared to be held together by rust, duct tape, and bailing wire and was driven by a big friendly, fur cap wearing guy named Buck, an ex-hiker whose trail name is Desert Reprobate. He had just arrived today after driving cross country from California to work as a shuttle driver during the hiker season (I can't make a this stuff up!).
During an exciting ride down the mountain, I heard back from Marguerite that Fed-Ex guarantees overnight delivery to anywhere in the world - except Hiawassee, GA. What ensued next was a scramble across Morgantown, WV, as she and her sister Marilyn drove from Fed-Ex to UPS to the post office, where the USPS guaranteed express delivery by 3 pm Sunday. The final plan was that she would ship the package to the Top Of Georgia hiker hostel, which is located right off the AT 19 miles away at Dick's Creek Gap, where I will pick it up Sunday evening. We hope. 
So, now I am in the Budget Inn in Hiawassee, GA, with Blood Mt snoozing in the next bed over, Courtney next door, Alex, Jerome and Springer next to her, Sleepy Bear and Pudge down the way, and False Summit next to them. Just another day on the AT.","Low Gap Shelter, GA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555618,"3/4/17 Tray Mt Shelter, GAMiles hiked: 58.3 Miles to go: 2131.5When I was imagining what it would be like to hike the AT, I often imagined a day like today. We woke up around 7:00 AM at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. Blood Mt needed to mail a package home and I needed to get more denatured alcohol for my stove. AWOL's AT guide said that the hardware store in Hiawassee sold denatured alcohol by the ounce, so I headed there. I arrived at the store and asked the little old lady working the register about the alcohol and she told me that they no longer sold it by the ounce; however, I could purchase a can of it. Well, it turned out they only sold it in 1 gallon metal cans, which would be just a bit heavy to carry. So, I asked her if they sold Heet gasoline additive, which is essentially denatured alcohol. She said I would have to go to the auto parts store next to the Hardee's about a 1/2 mile down the road to buy Heet. Now, you need to understand something about thru hikers. We willingly choose to hike a 2200 mile trail; but, we hate to walk any more off-trail steps than we have to. So, I walked down the road and bought the Heet at the auto parts store (and stopped at Hardee's for a biscuit). As I was walking back up the road, I remembered that I also needed butane for my lighter. So, I stopped back in the hardware store and talked to the same lady.""Do you sell butane refills for lighters?""""Well Sir, if we have anything like that, it would probably be in the automotive section.""""Um, why would butane be in the automotive section? Wait, you have an automotive section!?""""Yes Sir. Aisle 3.""Of course, you know what they also had stocked in the automotive section in Aisle 3 - Heet! Bottles and bottles of Heet. Oh well, at least by walking to the auto store I got a biscuit. By the time we finished running our errands, we were too late for the 9 am shuttle back to Unicoi Gap, so we had to wait for the 11 am shuttle, along with Courtney and another hiker I had never met. When we arrived at Unicoi Gap, a church group from the Raleigh area was putting on a hiker feed, complete with grilled hamburgers and all the fixings. Like I said in a previous post, if someone offered me a hamburger I wasn't going to turn them down. The burger was delicious and the people were really nice. I only felt a little guilty eating a burger just after arriving in a van from town. Due to the late start, the day's hike was pretty short. This is what is known as a Nearo Day. There are two types of rest days: a Zero Day is when you hang out in town all day and hike zero miles. A Nearo day is when you spend a part of the day in town and only hike a few miles. Today's 5.7 mile hike counted as a Nearo; however, the hike included a climb from 2949 ft Unicoi Gap to 4193 ft Tray Mt, with a few ups and downs thrown in for good measure. The hiking weather was perfect - high 50s, sunny, and only a light breeze. And the views of the North Georgia mountains were incredible. To top it all off, the Tray Mt Shelter is the prettiest shelter I've seen so far. It sits on top of Tray Mt and looks out over a sea of mountains. The sunset was gorgeous! I got in early enough, followed by Courtney and Blood Mt, to find a nice place to pitch my tent, get water, and eat a leisurely dinner. One of the weekend hikers rating here even built a campfire as it was getting dark. There are probably another 30-40 people here - mostly new faces. The Trail is getting pretty busy. Tomorrow, we make for Dick's Creek Gap and the Tip of Georgia hostel where my warmer sleeping bag will hopefully be waiting. Another good day on the trail.","Hiawassee, GA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555693,"3/5/17 Plumorchard Gap Shelter, GAMiles hiked: 73.8, Miles to go: 2116.0We awoke to a glorious sunrise on Tray Mt. The view to the east was incredible. Most people quickly packed up and headed out. I took my time and drank my tea and watched the sunrise. I knew I only had 11 miles to hike to get to the Top of Georgia hiker hostel to pick up my heavier sleeping bag, so I was in no hurry. Last night was a little warmer, so I didn't freeze. I was pretty cold; but, not teeth-chattering cold. The hike to Dick's Creek Gap, where Top of Georgia hostel is located, was pretty easy, with only one really steep climb over Kelly Knob. As a result, I reached the hostel by 1 pm. I was able to get my box (yay!) and pack up a few things to send home. I was also able to get a couple of hot dogs and a Mt Dew for lunch. I had planned to spend the night at the hostel and had reserved a bed in the bunkhouse the previous day; however, it was still early, it was beautiful, I felt great, and I had been in Hiawassee and only hiked about five miles the day before. Therefore, I decided to press on to the next shelter. I was feeling a little antsy about getting trapped in the gravitational pull of Hiawassee. The hostel is located slightly north of the town and ran shuttles down to the town several times a day. It would feel weird to be back in Hiawassee - like I was making no forward progress or something.  I had already paid a non-refundable fee for the bed, so I ""paid it forward"" and let the next guy who arrived have my spot for free. He was so excited - my own little bit of trail magic. The only real downer was that I had passed Blood Mt and Courtney, who were also planning to stay there, earlier in the day and would be heading out before they arrived. I wasn't as worried about Courtney, she was just a young kid whose hike happened to coincide with mine for a few days. But, Blood Mt and I had really hit it off and I felt like I might be walking away from a good friendship. The problem is he hikes slower than I do. So, I either hike shorter days to keep with him or he hikes longer days (and risks injuring himself) to keep up with me. One thing I promised myself when I started this hike is that I wasn't going to get caught up in someone else's hike. I was going to hike my own hike. So, in the end, I left him a note and headed back out. The rest of the hike was uneventful and almost melancholy. The pretty sunny day had clouded over and the woods had changed from fairly open ridge tops to more dark and shaded valley. When I arrived at the shelter, I realized that they were all strangers and I felt a little out of place. But thru hikers being who they are, it wasn't long until we were all sitting together fixing dinner and getting to know one another. I am now sitting in my tent in my warm and comfy sleeping bag feeling content about my decision. One funny, almost tragic, thing happened last night that I probably shouldn't share; but, you guys have hiked this far with me, so I guess we're like old friends. Like I mentioned, it was really cold last night. I should also mention that, ever since I had a run-in with kidney stones a few years ago that put me in the hospital, I drink a lot of water. I realized after the kidney stones that I did not consume enough water and was in a perpetual state of dehydration, which contributed to the formation of the kidney stones. So, I have been consuming a gallon or more of water every day during this hike. Of course, at some point that water has to come back out - even if you are sleeping in a tent in 29 degree weather on top of a mountain in Georgia. Well, an acquaintance who hiked the AT last year had suggested to me that I should keep an empty bottle in my tent to use so I didn't have to traipse around in the dark and cold to relieve myself in the middle of the night. Keeping this in mind, I held on to a small orange juice bottle that I had bought in Hiawassee. Now, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person and I learned in paramedic school about how much urine is produced by the average adult male. Of course, I didn't take time to consider that when I chose this bottle. I just wanted something small that would easily fit into the outer mesh pocket of my pack (you see where this is going, don't you?). Anyway, during the middle of the cold, dark night I awoke to the feeling of needing to pee. Bad! I grabbed my bottle and sat up in my sleeping bag. Oh, blessed relief! As the level of the fluid continued to rise in the bottle, the magnitude of the impending tragedy began to soak in, as it were. I was in a sleeping bag in a zipped up tent and, I don't know about you, but I can't just turn on and off the spigot at will. As I watched the level of the yellow liquid increase with mounting horror, I had visions of carrying a pee-soaked down hiking quilt into the hostel and having to explain why I needed to wash it before I shipped it home. Luckily, the bottle turned out to be just large enough - tragedy averted! By the way, while I was at the Top of Georgia hostel today, I bought a Gatorade. It's a much bigger bottle than an orange juice bottle.","Tray Mt Shelter,GA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555792,"3/6/17 Beech Gap Tenting Area, NCMiles hiked: 90.4, Miles to go: 2099.4I awoke to rain on my tent at 4:30 am. I had actually slept much better last night with the warmer sleeping bag. Everything with backpacking is a trade-off: weight vs comfort. Some people come out here with tiny ultralight packs that weigh under 20 lbs and some come out with 60 lb monster packs. I fall in the middle at about 30-35 lbs. It was another blustery day with rain on and off until about 2:00 pm. The highlight of the day was crossing the NC/GA border. We can now mark one state off the list. North Carolina wanted to make sure us punk thru hikers who were feeling all high and mighty because we'd defeated Georgia knew who the real boss was. So, she threw 4708 ft Courthouse Bald at us as soon as we crossed the border. It was probably the hardest thing I've climbed since Blood Mt. Speaking of Blood Mt (the man, not the mountain), I got a text from him saying that he was taking a zero day at Top of Georgia hostel due to swelling in his ankles. I also got a text from Antman saying he was at Franklin, NC. I don't know where either of the girls are. I assume that Courtney is somewhere behind me and Alexa is probably in Harpers Ferry by now. It's probably safe to say that our little group from Blood Mt Cabins is done.I have begun to see some of the characters that the hiker Not Fade Away was talking about. I hiked for awhile with Beatin' Mice and Tippy Toes, a couple from Atlanta. Beatin' Mice (the man) hikes in a pagoda and has a large caliber pistol in a shoulder harness for ""protection"". I met Polaroid, a young woman who carries a full sized Polaroid camera and takes one picture a day with it. I have also met several stoners out here. It appears the stoner lifestyle and the hiker trash lifestyle mesh pretty well. One thing I will say for the stoners is that they are generous. I have been offered a toke several times. I always graciously decline (the last thing I need is residual THC in my blood when I apply for a paramedic job in the Fall). They always look confused and a little hurt when I decline. Sorta like, ""I thought you were one of us."" I guess I look enough like a stoner that they just assume. I've been surprised by the number of women I have seen on the trail. Traditionally, the ratio has been something like 80:20 men to women. This year it appears to be more like 60:40. I assume it's the effect of the book and movie ""Wild"". I have also s a n a large number of veterans. A veteran I talked to (see below) attributes it to the trail working as a good transition from military to civilian life. I had planned to stop at Standing Indian Mt Shelter for the evening; however, the talk is that bad weather will be moving in overnight. So, I decided to cross the 5435 ft mountain today rather than risk crossing it in bad weather tomorrow. Besides the sun was out and perhaps I would actually get a view from the summit. It turns out that the climb was a breeze! The treadway was mostly smooth, soft dirt and it was nicely graded. It appears to have been an old logging or fire road at one time. And it had switchbacks! It must be very expensive to ship switchbacks out from the Rockies because we've seen precious few of them in the Southern Appalachians. Generally, it's a frontal assault straight up the mountain. Of course, as I climbed Standing Indian Mt, the clouds moved back in and visibility dropped to just a few feet. As I neared the summit, I heard a crow caw and imagined the spirit of the old Indian himself was laughing at my folly for have the audacity to think that I might steal a view from his summit. We have moved into the area that was so devastated by forest fires last Fall. The standing trees appear to be OK, with scorch marks on the lower 12 - 18 inches of their trunks. However, the undergrowth is completely gone. It looks like some kind of strange war zone. I finally reached Beech Gap tenting area after a long day of hiking. There was a young couple and a man that I had seen earlier in the day standing by a fire. They welcomed me and I immediately set up my tent so it could dry from this morning's rain. After we ate and the young couple retired to their tent to do whatever young couples do in their tent, the other hiker, Baloo, and I sat by the fire and talked for a couple of hours. He is a recently retired 46 year old US Army Lt Colonel and oozes integrity from every pore. I really enjoyed his company. It is amazing to me still how easy it is to strike up conversation with complete strangers on the AT.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555850,"3/7/17 Budget Inn Franklin, NCMiles hiked: 105.8, Miles to go: 2084.0It was the most miserable day on the trail so far. And the most epic! I awoke to rain. It had rained off and on all night. Baloo was just heading out as I was packing up in a light rain. He is section hiking and doing big miles, so we said our goodbyes. The young couple was still in their tent doing whatever young couples do in tents. I started out in my long pants and Goretex jacket because it was pretty chilly; but, after a couple of miles I switched back to my kilt and took off the jacket. In a soft rain, you get just as wet from sweating in the jacket as you do from the rain. I walked in a tunnel all day. The fog was so thick, you could only see 20 ft ahead. The forest was quiet except for the wind and constant dripping off the rhododendrons. The face of the forest has changed since Georgia. It is much more lush, with rhododendron thickets everywhere - although these are all burned. There were no views to be had and I saw no other NOBO hikers all morning. I did see a few southbound section hikers; but, everyone was in their own world and no one felt like conversation. It was pretty much a miserable day. The trail was actually quite nice, with a smooth treadway and long but gentle ascents and descents. Then I started up 5250 ft Albert Mt. The lead-up was about a two mile ascent in which I gained about 550 ft. The trail was essentially stuck on the side of the mountain. Now don't get me wrong - it was an incredible feat of trail engineering. But, at one point, I looked down and realized a misstep would send me off into the white abyss. I couldn't tell how far down it was due to the thick fog; but, I think it was far enough. Then we reached the last 0.3 miles. The elevation profile on the map showed the trail going straight up - and it was right. To make matters worse, this is when the rain went from gentle to maelstrom. The wind kicked up and the rain started pelting down. The trail was so steep that, at times, I had to throw my walking sticks ahead of me and pull myself up with my hands. Meanwhile, the trail, which was bare rock at this point, turned into a waterfall, cascading down upon me. And the rock got slick. And my glasses fogged up. This is when the Wilderness EMT inside of me decided to speak up. ""Dude! You are in prime hypothermia conditions! It's 50 degrees, the wind is raging, the rain is soaking you, you are expending a lot of energy and you're wearing short sleeves and a kilt!"" To which I responded, ""I'm a little busy right now! My hands are kinda tied up holding onto the side of the mountain. Besides, there's nowhere to stop and take off my pack and put on my Goretex jacket!"" It was epic!The climb seemed to go on forever; but, I finally reached the top. There was a fire tower at the top. The guidebook suggests going up in the fire tower to see the fantastic views. Bummer. The other cool thing about the tower is that it is at the 100 mile mark. I have entered triple digits hiked!I really was beginning to get chilled at this point. So, I put on my Goretex jacket and started hoofing it down the trail to warm back up. At this point, a plan began to form in my mind. If I can keep hoofing it and pass the next two shelters, I can cover 19 miles to Winding Stair Gap and go into Franklin for the night. The more the rain pelted me, the more I liked this plan. At Rock Gap, which was about three miles before Winding Stair Gap, I came upon another thru hiker standing next to the road, which happened to intersect with the trail. He said, ""Hey, you made it! The bus will be here in ten minutes.""""Bus?""""Yeah. Didn't you know the county runs a special bus for thru hikers to take them into Franklin. It's only three bucks.""Woo hoo! The best three bucks I've spent on the trail!At the next bus stop, which was Winding Stair Gap, who should be standing there but Baloo? He also decided to head into town out of the rain. It gets even freakier. On the way down the mountain, I got a text from Antman wondering where I was on the trail. It turns out that he had arrived in Franklin yesterday and taken a zero day. Apparently, Alexa is in town somewhere too!After I got settled in my hotel room at Budget Inn (yeah, it's owned by the same guy who owns the Budget Inn in Hiawassee), showered, washed clothes, and laid my stuff out to dry, Antman and I met up for dinner and shared tales of our adventures. It was kind of a bummer to miss out on the apparently amazing views on Albert Mt; but, on reflection, I'm glad it worked out the way at it did. This way, I had a much more epic tale to share! The weather is supposed to be sunny tomorrow. Yay. 
Also, one point of clarification. A reader was confused by my post the other day when I said Beatin' Mice hiked in a pagoda. I was referring to the conical hats like the Vietnamese farmers wear. I had always thought they were referred to as pagodas (yes, I know a pagoda is a building).
Apparently, Google doesn't think so. Sorry for the confusion.","Beech Gap Tenting Area

I planned to take the 11 am shuttle back to Rock Gap; however, I needed to resupply and figure out why my water filter was leaking. It was too far to walk to the Ingles, so i ended up resupplying at Dollar General. It's actually surprising how much food Dollar General carries. After resupplying, I went to the local outfitter store to see if I could get a new gasket for my Sawyer water filter. I filter or chemically treat all of my water. I've known too many hikers who have ended up with giardiasis to risk drinking untreated water. It turns out that Sawyer changed the design of their filters a couple of years ago because of the leaking issue I was experiencing. In the end, I ended up just replacing the filter. The motel offered free shuttle rides back to the trailhead. The bus was driven by Ron Haven, the owner of the Budget Inn. Ron is one of these larger than life characters that has owned five motels, been a professional wrestler, owned 90 rental units,restores older model pick up trucks and organizes gun shows. He also apparently knows just about everyone associated with the AT. Needless to say, the ride back to the trailhead was entertaining. Of course, when I started hiking out of Rock Gap, I immediately started climbing. A Gap is where two mountains meet and is lower than the summit of either mountain. So, naturally, most roads go through gaps. I consider ""Gap"" a four letter word. The first few miles after a town stop are always the worst. You are almost always climbing, your pack is heavy because you've just added several day's worth of food, and you are sluggish because you've eaten too much while in town. Before too long, though, you get into a rhythm and you start eating up the miles. After a couple of ups and downs I came to Winding Stair Gap and started the long climb to Siler Bald. On the way up the hill, a met an older couple coming down who had been out for a day hike. After exchanging pleasantries the man said, ""Hey, how would you like an orange?"" Trail magic. Score! I ate it with dinner. It was yummy. The clim to Siler Bald was almost four miles long and seemed to go on forever. The climb was well worth it though. Balds are grassy summits that occur in the Southern Appalachins. I have never heard a good explanation as to why some mountains have grass on the summit. I reached to summit of 5001 ft Siler Bald in the late afternoon as the shadows were getting long. It is a steep 0.2 mile climb to the actual summit from where the AT crosses Siler Bald. Once again, the climb was well worth it. 360 degree views of beautiful mountains. It was gorgeous. I decided to camp on Siler Bald; but, due to pretty windy conditions on the summit, I chose a campsite a little lower down that was out of the wind. Just as I started to set up my tent, who should show up but Courtney. It's funny how your hikes flow into and out of the hikes of those around you. While I finished setting up camp, Courtney decided to camp on the summit and climbed on up. After dinner, as it was beginning to get dark, I built a small fire. Pretty soon I see Courtney walking down from the summit. She joined me at the fire and we discussed our separate adventures since we'd last crossed paths. As the fire died down, she reluctantly trudged back to the summit, where I can hear the wind blowing pretty strongly. There are a bajillion stars in the sky and I'm ready for bed. Not an epic day like yesterday; but , a very pleasant one nonetheless.","Franklin, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556002,"3/9/17 Wesser Bald Shelter, NCMiles hiked: 131.1, Miles to go: 2058.7Today was my longest hike to date - 17 miles. I had only planned to do about 12; but, sometimes plans change. I awoke to a beautiful sunrise on Siler Bald. Courtney came down from the summit as I was finishing packing my gear and informed me that I had missed out on the best sunrise ever. I saw it just fine from my campsite slightly below the summit. The trail In the morning proved to be fairly difficult. Steep ascents and descents and rocky and rooty treadway. I continue to walk through burned out forest. The forest fire in this section appears to have been particularly bad. When I reached the top of Wayah Bald I actually had to search a bit for the trail because the trees with the white blazes had been cut down or had been burned. The stone tower on Wayah Bald used to have a wooden roof. Now all it has is four burned out posts and several melted plastic interpretive signs. Unfortunately, under our current Administration, I doubt there will be money earmarked for those kinds of repairs. I ran into Tiptoe and Right Move at Wayah Bald. I had ridden on the shuttle out of Franklin with them yesterday. Tiptoe is a skinny guy with wiry hair and a pointy goatee. He carries a plastic ukulele. His name derives from the Tiny Tim song, of course (if you don't know who Tiny Tim is, Google it). Right Move is more muscular, with a shaved head and tattoos. Both guys are really cool. I would play leapfrog with them the rest of the day. After Wayah Bald, I ran into a ridgerunner with the Nantahala AT Club. She was touring the shelters under their care picking up trash. Trash left by hikers is a big problem. I guess they figure it either doesn't matter or someone else will pick it up. I actually had trouble getting away from the woman. She really talked my ear off. The trail after Wayah Bald settled down quite a bit. The ups and downs got more reasonable and the treadway smoothed out. Coming into Burningtown Gap I saw a sign every thru hiker loves-""Trail magic ahead"". When I arrived at the gap, there was a man handing out food and drinks. I had a Gatorade and oatmeal cream pie. Yum! I also took an apple for later. I dearly missed my apples since the Dollar General in Franklin didn't carry any produce. Eating healthy food is a real issue on the trail. It's hard to carry enough weight in food to meet your daily caloric needs due to the huge calories you're burning every day. So, you end up carrying calorie-dense foods, such as Snickers bars. After a long climb out of the gap, I finally reached Cold Spring Gap Shelter. I also finally caught up with Courtney. It was only 3 pm, which was too early to stop for the day. So, I decided to push on another 1.4 miles to the Big Branch Campsite on the other side of Rocky Bald. Courtney is planning to meet her parents tomorrow at the next gap past   Cold Spring Gap Shelter, so she decided to stay put. We said our goodbyes; but, I suspect as often happens on the AT, we will meet again. It was a pretty long climb up and over the summit; but, I finally reached the Campsite. I was not impressed. It was perched on the side of the mountain and there was not a flat site to be had. I looked at my guidebook and determined it was another 3.7 miles to Wesser Bald Shelter, up and over Wesser Bald. It would be pushing it, but I should be able to make it just before dark. I started hoofing it and made it just as the sun was going down. Unfortunately, the tent sites here are just as bad as at the Campsite. To top it off, I walked right into the middle of a dispute between some of the people in the shelter over whether to hang their food on the bear cables or not. The final blow was when I received a text from Blood Mt saying he and Popcorn and Sticks and Pudge were all together in Franklin having a nice evening. So, here I am in my tent which is set up on a slope. That means I'll be sliding sideways in my sleeping bag all night. It's supposed to thunderstorm later tonight. And the guy in the next tent over is snoring like a freight train. It's going to be a long night. Bummer. Sorry if this installment isn't a sparkling as the others.

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556079,"3/10/17 Nantahala Outdoor CenterMiles hiked: 137.0, Miles to go: 2052.8What a difference a day makes. The lightning storm came in with a with a flash and a bang, high winds, and rain; but, it was fairly short lived. I actually slept pretty well, with only a small amount of sliding on the incline. And the guy next to me quit snoring. I knew I had a short day into the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) so I didn't rush out of camp. I let the high winds dry my tent while having a leisurely breakfast. I left at the same time as two other 50-something hikers, Rooster and Hydrator, and ended up hiking the 5.9 miles to the NOC with them. It was a pretty epic hike along a narrow ridge with a precipitous drop off either side. We reached the end of the ridge at the Jumpoff. The Jumpoff is an incredible rock formation that juts out at the end of the ridge, with 240 degree views. It was incredible! Then we started the drop into the Nantahala River Gorge, a 2200 ft drop with some fairly technical rock scrambles that took all of our concentration. To add to the stress, the wildfires last Fall had ravaged the trail through this section, making the treadway pretty unstable in places. It was epic! Albert Mt all over again - minus the rain. In fact, during our hike, the sun broke out and gave us a beautiful day to hike. Constant conversation with Hydrator and Rooster made the hike pass quickly. Rooster has a good friend who was recently diagnosed with ALS, so he is hiking to raise awareness of ALS and raise money for ALS research. Check out his website at http://Hike4Roger.com. We reached the bottom and arrived at the NOC. It's a really cool place on the Nantahala River that offers all kinds of outdoor recreation like whitewater rafting and zip lines. In fact, this was the site of the whitewater canoe events at the 1996 Olympics. They have a restaurant, a well stocked outfitter, general store, laundry, and bunkhouses. It's another landmark spot on the trail. I had reserved a bunk and planned a Nearo as a rest day. The term ""rest day"" is a misnomer. There are always chores to be done: laundry, shower, restock food, repair/replace equipment, eat. We did all those things and had a pleasant day of it. As Rooster, Hydrator, and I sat down to dinner, Tiptoe and Right Move came in. We invited them over and we all had a great dinner discussing our adventures so far on the trail. When I returned to the bunkhouse after dinner I found that I had been joined in the eight bunk room by two more people - Tiptoe and Right Move! How cool. Spring has begun to arrive in the Southern Appalachians. We are seeing tender green shoots and little purple flowers poking up among the ash and char of the burned forest. Insects are buzzing around us throughout the day. Buds are appearing on the trees. And I heard my first neeker breekers in the pond near the bunkhouse. On the flip side, we are all watching the weather and evaluating. Forecasts are calling for 6-8 inches of heavy snow in the mountains tomorrow night. We are all debating wether to head out tomorrow and risk getting stranded at a shelter or just take a zero day at the NOC. It appears for awhile at least, I have found a pretty cool group to hang with. I had a reader ask if we actually call each other by our trail names. In the beginning, as we were all still a little uncomfortable in our thru hiker skins and hadn't all acquired trail names, we still used each other's given names. Now, as most of us are beginning to feel more comfortable on the trail and have done something to acquire a trail name, the given names are fading away. In fact, I don't know Rooster's, Hydrator's, Tiptoe's, or Right Move's given names. I think trail names serve a couple of purposes. First, in a world where we share space so intimately in shelters and hostels (most of the privies don't even have roofs or doors), trail names give us just a little piece of anonymity. Second, it makes us all part of the thru hiker tribe. And, finally, it separates us from our real world selves and allows us to be someone a little different for a short while. I'll keep you posted about the upcoming Winter storm and how it affects our hike.","Wesser Bald Shelter

The total accumulation predictions had dropped from 5-8 inches to 3-5 inches, so I decided to go ahead and head out. Tiptoe and Right Move decided to take a zero day at the NOC and allow the snow to move through. When I went to Rooster and Hydrator's cabin they were waffling about whether to take a zero or not; however, when they heard I was heading out, they decided to go also. I had to wait around a bit while they got their stuff together; but, soon enough we were under way.   We left under full sun; but, pretty soon the clouds moved in and the skies began to take on that leaden appearance that portended snow. The climb out of the Nantahala Gorge was as advertised - long, steep, steady, and never ending. We gained 3678 ft in elevation over the next 5.8 miles. We climbed for over four hours. At times the trail was so steep I was walking only on my toes, with my heels off the ground. Rooster is a faster hiker than either me or Hydrator, so he would hike ahead and wait for us to catch up. He could have left us in the dust; but, he was a patient man. As we climbed, we began to be pelted by tiny ice pellets, then snow, then back to ice. At least it wasn't rain. After what seemed an eternity of climbing, we finally reached the Sassafras Gap Shelter and decided to stop for lunch. When we entered the shelter, we found six people already there in their sleeping bags hunkered down waiting for the snow. It was only 12:30 pm and the snow was not even predicted to start accumulating until 7:00 pm. I couldn't imagine just sitting around all day in my sleeping bag waiting for the snow. After a quick lunch, we continued climbing up and over 5062 ft Cheoah Bald. Although the snow continued to swirl, it never really accumulated. About 3:00 pm, we started looking at our options for the night. We had originally planned on a 15.8 mile hike to Brown Fork Shelter; but, the long climb had taken longer than we had planned and left us pretty wiped out. We decided to stop at Stecoah Gap. There was a hiker hostel listed in AWOL's AT Guide that Hydrator was really pushing for us to go to. I believe he was pretty concerned about the impending snow and felt that his tent wasn't quite up to the task. Rooster and I were less inclined to go to a hostel since we had just stayed at the NOC; however, we finally agreed to go to the hostel. When I called the hostel, called Cabin in the Woods, the proprietor was not very excited at the prospect of having to get us back to Stecoah Gap in the morning if we actually got the predicted snow. So much for our plan. Rooster and I were ready to just camp; but, Hydrator was still concerned about the snow and didn't want to camp. In the end, he ended up making arrangements for a shuttle driver to meet us at Stecoah Gap and take him to a Microtel in nearby Robinsville. Rooster and I didn't want to pay the $79 apiece for a room, so we planned to camp.   It looked like the end of our little group, with Hydrator going to town and us staying on the trail. When we arrived at Stecoah Gap, Rooster and I started looking for a place to camp. Hydrator came walking up and said that he just found a business card stuck to the sign at Stecoah Gap that advertised a hostel, called Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel, that wasn't listed in AWOL's guide. Hydrator called the number and found out that it was $25/person and was only 2.5 miles from the gap. We decided that sounded pretty good, especially since we couldn't find a suitable camping spot and a very cold rain had begun to fall. The shuttle driver that Hydrator had called arrived, so we told her of the change in plans. She agreed to take all three of us to the hostel. She was a really nice lady named Becky who had a really nice Lincoln MkT. We hated to put our muddy boots in her car; but she was quite insistent. At first, she wasn't familiar with the hostel, which concerned me a bit. Then she said, ""Oh, wait! That's Lonnie's place. I haven't seen it yet; but, he told me that he had converted his old house behind the gas station into a hostel."" Hmm, sounding better all the time... It occurred to me that I was flying down a rural North Carolina road at dusk on a snowy evening with two guys whose given names I don't even know, being driven by a total stranger, and being taken to a house behind a gas station. Stephen King couldn't have come up with a better opening scene for one of his novels. When we arrived, it indeed was an old house set back in the woods behind a gas station. I sorta had visions of Silence of the Lambs (""It puts the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again""). Becky called Lonnie on the phone to let him know that she'd brought us there. He said that he was out picking up another hiker; but, that we should go on in. Becky decided to come in and take a look around too. When we walked in there were a father and 15 year old son sitting there watching TV. They were section hikers who had bitten off a little more than they could chew and had bailed when they found Lonnie's business card at Stecoah Gap. The house turned out to be great! We each got our own bedroom with sheets and blankets and it had full shower, laundry, and kitchen available. Becky took us back down the road to a local diner where we had a good hot meal. Lonnie stopped by when we were done eating and took us back to the hostel. He turned out to be a really nice guy who bent over backwards to accommodate us. He even offered us each a beer. Apparently, this is a dry county, so he goes to the next county over and buys a case of Yeungling and keeps it in the trunk of his car to offer to thru hikers.So far, the snow has failed to materialize. So, we would have been fine camping it appears. This is actually much nicer. On a side note, we actually ran into three Southbounders (SOBOs) today! They started from Maine last September and hiked through the winter. They had a lean, confident, weathered look about them that made us look like squeaky clean baby hikers. I guess we'll have that cool hiker trash look by this August.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556239,"3/12/17 Fontana Village, NCMiles hiked: 164.4, Miles to go: 2025.4The big snow event turned out to be about 2-3 inches of snow on the AT. I awoke at Lonnie's hostel around 7:30 AM. I had planned to get up earlier; but, with the time change, I ended up sleeping in longer than expected, as did Rooster and Hydrator. Lonnie showed up around 9:00 and by the time we got our stuff together and he drove us back to Stecoah Gap, it was about 10:00 AM when we started hiking. Immediately out of Stecoah Gap we started climbing Jacob's Ladder. I have learned that there are so many features on the trail that if a feature earns a name it's probably significant. Well, Jacob's Ladder was steep! And with 2-3 inches of snow on the trail over top of mud, it was slick. By the time we slogged our way to the top, we were all roasting. The sun broke out about 11:00 AM and the temperature quickly rose into the 40s. With the sun and warmer temperatures, the snow quickly began to melt. After Jacob's Ladder the trail quickly moderated and we had a pleasant hike along undulating ridge lines, with only a couple of steep hills to contend with. We quickly learned that, with the slick snow and mud, the downhills were the hardest part. I ended up on my butt twice and Hydrator went down three times. Rooster managed to keep his feet, but only after a couple fairly close and acrobatic saves. With the pleasant weather and pleasant company the day passed quickly. After hiking 8.5 miles, we stopped for lunch at Cable Gap Shelter. I was fairly chagrined to find that someone had left their trash at the shelter. So, Rooster and I split it up and carried out someone else's trash. It really irritates me when people are so inconsiderate. After lunch, we had one more big climb. Then we started the long descent into Fontana Gap. There is a large lake in Fontana Gap and, in fact, the AT crosses over the dam, which is the highest dam east of the Mississippi. The descent was a 1700 ft drop over three miles and seemed to take forever! We finally reached the bottom around 4:30 PM. We had made reservations at the Fontana Lodge (yes - our third night in a row sleeping inside!). When we reached the Fontana Marina we called the lodge and requested a ride to the lodge, which was about 1.7 miles away. They sent the maintenance guy in a beat up pickup truck to retrieve us. I sat in the front and the other two rode in the bed of the truck with our packs. Apparently, it was a chilly ride for them. My ride was quite pleasant. Now I am in my room at the Fontana Lodge, enjoying the amenities. Tomorrow, Rooster and I cross the Fontana Dam and enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Hydrator is taking a zero day tomorrow to meet up with his girlfriend. My current plan is to go off-trail at Newfound Gap on Wednesday for a couple of zero days in Knoxville to visit with Chris, Eleanor, and Marguerite. Woo hoo! Only, now they are calling for snow and extremely cold weather, which may lead to closure of the road to Newfound Gap. All the thru hikers are debating what to do next. We'll see what tomorrow brings, I guess.","Stecoah Gap, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556301,"3/13/17 Fontana Lodge/Knoxville, TNMiles hiked: 164.4, Miles to go: 2025.4So, the plan was to spend the night at Fontana Lodge, cross the dam this morning, and head up into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park with Rooster. Hydrator is spending the night at the lodge with his girlfriend, then planned to head out tomorrow. I was going to hike the 42 miles to Newfound Gap, where my daughter-in-law Eleanor was going to pick me up Wednesday afternoon and take me to Knoxville for two zero days with her, Chris, and Marguerite. Well, the weather has put the kibosh on all those plans. Right now, it's a pretty day on Fontana Lake; however, it's supposed to turn rainy this afternoon, then to snow tonight. And then the cold moves in. Predictions are for highs in the teens, lows in the single digits, and wind gusts upwards of 40 mph, with below zero wind chills. The forecast is for 4-8 inches of snow or more in the mountains, on top of what came down earlier this week. The road to Newfound Gap is already closed from the previous snow event. The problem is that once you enter the Smokies, the only place to exit before Davenport Gap (80 miles up the trail) is Newfound Gap. The rest of that time is spent on top of the ridges at 5000-6000 ft elevations. All the thru hikers are scrambling to make alternate plans for the next couple of days. Rooster is heading back to Lonnie's hostel, where Hydrator will join him tomorrow. Several people are hunkering down here at the lodge for a couple days. Some are hopping over the Smokies to Hot Springs to continue North and will come back ""someday"" to pick up this section. A few hardy (and foolish) souls are heading on up into the mountains. Several of us are pretty worried about a 60-something woman thru hiker who appears to be woefully unequipped for the temps who headed out across the dam this morning. There are all these thru hikers haunting Fontana Village like Lost Souls in puffy jackets, quick-drying khaki pants with zip-off legs, and muddy boots. We wistfully glance up at the mountain peaks overshadowing the valley and mutter to ourselves. We have been out here two to three weeks at this point and are just beginning to hit our strides. The winnowing process has eliminated about half of those that started with us. We have almost convinced ourselves that we just might be thru hiker material. We are frustrated that we've hit this obstacle that has slowed us down and wonder if maybe we should have gone ahead and pushed on into the mountains. The tourists just shake their heads and think we are weird. I made arrangements for a shuttle driver to take me to Knoxville this afternoon, where I will hang out until Saturday. Steve, the driver, has been a back country outfitter in the Smokies for 24 years, leading fly fishing trips. He is also the he husband of Becky, the woman who shuttled us from Stecoah Gap to Lonnie's hostel. Steve is a very interesting man who thru hiked the AT last year. Between his fishing and AT stories, it was a quick ride to Knoxville. I'm now hanging out at Chris' house in Knoxville waiting for Marguerite to arrive Wednesday. It is pouring the rain here, so I imagine it is snowing like crazy above 5000 ft. Although I'm a little frustrated not to be making miles through the Smokies, I'm glad not to be in the terrible winter weather.","Fontana Village

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556414,"3/14/17 Knoxville, TNMiles hiked: 164.4, Miles to go: 2025.4I enjoyed the zero day in Knoxville hanging out with Chris' dogs and visiting the local outfitter store. I heard from Antman. He headed up into the Smokies on Friday. He reached Newfound Gap today. He said it was gnarly up there. Snow, cold temps, high winds, and big snow drifts. When he and a couple other hikers reached Newfound Gap, the road was closed. Luckily, a snow plow driver took pity on them and took them the 15 miles down the mountain to Gatlinburg. They plan to zero until at least Thursday to allow the weather to improve. Since I don't have any trail tales to share, I thought I'd share some trail background. Hiking the trail is cool in one respect in that you generally don't have the worries of the outside world. Most hikers have put their outside lives on hold. No bills, no daily work grind, no rush hour traffic. I haven't even listened to the news in a couple of weeks. Your concerns are reduced to the basics: where am I going to find water? Where am I going to sleep? How steep is the upcoming hill? Generally, it's pretty nice; but, it's also a bit of a pain. The biggest pain is no running water. You don't think about how much you depend on running water until you don't have it. You can't wash your hands, you can't wash your food, you can't wash your dishes, you can't wash your clothes, you can't flush the toilet. We all have visions of drinking out of clear mountain streams; but, in reality, you need to treat all your water. Unless you can see it coming from a spring straight out of the ground high on a mountain, you have no idea what may have possibly contaminated it upstream. Believe me, with no running water, you don't want to get diarrhea in the backcountry. Most people carry either a filter or chemical treatment. If you carry a filter, you have to make sure that it doesn't freeze and crack. So, on cold days you carry it in your pocket and on cold nights you sleep with it in your sleeping bag. Keeping clean becomes a real problem. Baby wipes and alcohol gel cleaners become your best friends. Thru hikers don't shake hands (I know where my hands have been; but, I don't know where yours have been). Instead, thru hikers either bump fists or elbows in greeting. If someone offers me food such as M&Ms or trail mix, I politely decline unless I watch them open a new package (I know where my hands have been; but, I don't know where yours have been). If I offer someone something to eat, I pour it in their hand. I don't let them reach in the bag (I know where my hands have been; but, I don't know where yours have been).E-coli contamination is the issue. There are no bathrooms with flush toilets. Most shelters have privies; however, the privies are just a hole with a toilet seat. The privies have no doors and many don't have roofs. You just do your business there in front of God and everybody. You also carry your own toilet paper and wipes. If you are not camping at a shelter at night or if you are not at a shelter when you have to go, you find a nice spot in the woods away from water sources, campsites, trails, etc, and dig a hole six inches deep, do your business and cover it back over. Leave No Trace ethics require that you carry out the used TP. There's nothing worse than seeing little white TP flowers on the ground where some animal has dug up where someone tried to bury the TP. I have a special airtight, odorproof bag, called a Stink Sack, in which I carry out used TP and wipes for later disposal. Of course, the first thing every thru hiker does when they hit town is wash their hands. Hey, this thru hiking business is no walk in the park. Next time I'll tell you about hiker midnight, hiker boxes, and bear bagging.","Knoxville, TN

Most people are planning on heading out tomorrow. Marguerite is on her way to Knoxville for our previously planned meet up, so I won't return to the trail until Saturday (it'll be definitely be worth the delay to see Marguerite). I'm just sort of bumming around town today checking out downtown Knoxville. It's now later in the evening and Marguerite made it to Knoxville. It was really great to see her. The past two and a half weeks are the longest we've been apart in 20 years. We went out for pizza and trivia night at Barley's.

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556674,"3/16/17 Knoxville, TNMiles hiked: 164.4, Miles to go: 2025.4 So, we bought a house in Knoxville yesterday. Before this whole AT adventure kicked off we had developed a timeline. The plan was that I would leave my job in March 2017 and hike the AT. Marguerite would stay at her job until September 2017 to provide us with insurance. I would return from the trail in late Summer or early Fall and work as a full time medic in WV until Spring 2018, when we would put our house on the market and move to Knoxville, TN. Then our employer (Marguerite and I worked at the same place) offered a Voluntary Separation Package (VSP) that we both chose to take. We decided that, rather than wait until 2018, it made more sense to go ahead and put the house on the market this year. We worked like dogs, painting and fixing up the house before I left for the trail. I started in the AT on Sunday, Feb 26, with residual paint on my arms and hands and the house went on the market Monday, Feb 27. The very first couple to look at it signed a contract for the asking price! Woo hoo!Before leaving for the AT, we switched from AT&T to Verizon because Verizon has the best cell phone coverage on the trail and AT&T has the worst (""No AT&T on the AT!""). I have had really good coverage on the trail pretty much every day - except Monday, Feb 27. On Monday, Feb 27, I needed phone signal to be able to electronically sign the contract for the sale of our house. I was at Hawk Mountain Tent Site and had intermittent signal, so I walked up and down the trail trying to find enough signal to complete these documents. Of course, this all happened in the evening - after dark. So, here I am walking up and down in the pitch black (and cold!) with just my headlamp to light the way. After several miles and hours, I finally completed the documents. When the bad weather arose in the Smokies earlier this week, I already had plans to come off the trail to look at a potential house in Knoxville. The weather just pushed me off the trail a little earlier than planned. So, anyway, we liked the house and when Marguerite arrived yesterday we signed the contract. I plan to return to the trail Saturday morning and continue my northbound journey until mid to late April, when I will have to take a couple weeks off-trail to help move the household (including three dogs and two cats) to Knoxville. Upon completion of the trail, it will be like the John Denver song Rocky Mountain High - ""coming home to a place he'd never been before"". I'll be trading in ""Country Roads"" for ""Rocky Top"". I have already acquired a TN paramedic license, so I will do the full time medic gig here instead of WV. In the meantime, Marguerite and I are enjoying a couple of days together exploring Knoxville and discovering important places like ice cream shops.","Knoxville, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556887,"3/18/17 Russell Field Shelter, NCMiles hiked: 180.1, Miles to go: 2009.7It poured the rain last night in Knoxville, which sort of matched our moods as Marguerite and I prepared to say goodbye for another month. In sort of a cosmic joke, the Coleman air mattress we brought to sleep on at Chris' decided to spring a leak. It sank under my 200+ lb body, so poor little Marguerite kept rolling into the middle all night like she was trapped in my gravitational field. This morning dawned gray and overcast; but, at least the rain had passed. Chris and Marguerite accompanied me back to Fontana Village, where I had left off on Monday. We said our goodbyes and I headed off into the woods. I walked along the edge of Fontana Lake for about three miles. I passed the Fontana Hilton, one of the fanciest shelters on the trail, with flush toilets and a cold shower. I then walked across the Fontana Dam, which is the highest dam east of the Mississippi, and headed up into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The GSMNP, or the Smokies, is the most visited park in the National Park System, with 11 million visitors a year. The vast majority of those visitors never get more than a mile from their cars; however, even a small fraction of 11 millions people can have a big impact on the park's backcountry. Therefore, to lessen this impact, the Park Service has come up with some rules. Everyone needs a permit to hike in the backcountry and everyone must camp at shelters. Short-term hikers must specify where they plan to hike and which shelters they plan to stay in. Thru hikers purchase a permit ($20) that is valid for eight days to hike the 68 miles of the AT that run along the spine of the Smokies, high above the car tourists. They are required to stay in shelters along with the short-term hikers; however, if a shelter is full, they must surrender their spot in the shelter and set up a tent. As I entered the Smokies, I dropped the top portion of my permit into the permit box and started the long climb up to the ridge. I was coming off of five zero days in Knoxville, so I plan to push straight through the Smokies in five days. With no opportunity to resupply, my food bag is very heavy. So, the climb up the mountain proved to be pretty tough! Luckily, the sun came out and temps rose into the fifties. Also, the trail conditions turned out to be pretty nice - muddy, but no snow and ice.   The highlight of the day was climbing the Shuckstack Fire Tower. This is a decommissioned 50 ft fire tower on Shuckstack Mt. We had high winds all day with gusts up to 50 mph. Normally, I'm not bothered by heights; however, climbing that tower in 50 mph winds was a bit unnerving! My kilt was flapping in the wind for sure!I was expecting to see a lot of people on the trail today; but, my hike proved to be quite solitary. I saw a father and three young sons out for a three day hike and I saw one other NOBO - a fellow Mountaineer from Ritchie Co, WV, who I had previously met way back in GA. At one point while I was hiking, I heard a couple people hacking and coughing. Surely, it couldn't be... it was! It was the stoner couple I had met shortly after Plumorchard Shelter in GA! They were sitting on a log taking a break. There're still out here and still toking. They also still have their dog who is afraid of everyone. After some small talk, I headed on my way. Then it hit me - they still had their dog! One of the other rules in the Smokies is no dogs in the backcountry. I arrived at Mollie's Ridge Shelter and talked to a very nice Ridge Runner who told me there were still a couple of spots available in the shelter. I told him that I was thinking of pushing on the 3.4 miles to the next shelter. He told me that that Shelter was full and I'd have to tent. That made up my mind. I definitely wanted to push on so I would be able to tent and not have to sleep in the shelter. The shelters are full of disease carrying vermin every night. They also have mice! I sort of wanted to stick around and see what happened when the Ridge Runner saw the stoner's dog; but, I pushed on. I arrived at the Russell Field shelter and found that it indeed was full with a Boy Scout troop and other thru hikers. So, I am happily ensconced in my tent listening to coyotes howling in the distance. It's good to be back out here.","Knoxville, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556997,"3/19/17 Siler's Bald Shelter, NCMiles hiked: 194.7, Miles to go: 1995.1The AT kicked my butt today! I think I was still feeling the effects of a strenuous climb yesterday and my pack is still heavy from additional food - although I'm working on that. The real problem is that the trail threw everything at us today - snow, ice, mud, rocks, roots, steep ascents, and steep descents. It was much more difficult than what I and all the other hikers expected. We awoke in a cloud. And the cloud was full of ice crystals that coated everything. We hiked in the cloud all morning, until the sun finally broke through around 1 pm. It was in the low 20's when we awoke and it didn't warm up until the sun came out. It still never got out of the 40s. The kilt stayed in the pack today. I also found the crowd today. I saw a ton of hikers (actually, the weight of the hikers, plus all their gear probably weighed several tons). We were all being beat up by the trail. The ridge we are hiking through the Smokies runs roughly northeasterly. So, when you are on the south slope of the ridge the snow and ice have been melted due to full sun. On the northern slopes, where the sun has not hit, there is a lot of ice and snow. I even had to break out the micro spikes today. I have carried these things since GA in case I needed them. They were buried in the bottom of my pack, so I resisted digging them out. Finally, after a couple of slips, I berated myself enough about being lazy that I dug them out. They were incredible! It's like they were made for this! It made a huge difference on the icy sections. After hauling myself up and down (and up and down!) many mountains, I finally made it to Siler's Bald Shelter. I had considered going another 1.7 miles to the Double Springs Gap Shelter; however, by the time I reached Siler's Bald Shelter, I was done. There are about eight other hikers here and I am in the shelter for the first time on this hike. There is a roaring fire in the fireplace and it is actually quite comfortable. I think I'll sleep well tonight.","Russell Field Shelter, NC

No mice and minimal snoring. We awoke to a beautiful clear morning around 40 degrees. This was especially nice since we would be crossing 6643 ft Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT. On clear days, you can see up to 100 miles from the summit. Today's hike wasn't as tough as yesterday; but, it was still really tough. Hiking the Smokies isn't for sissies. I did come up with a theory while hiking today. The toughest day I've had on the AT was also the only day that I didn't wear my kilt. Coincidence? I think not!It was a fairly long and steep climb up Clingman's Dome; but, the sun was hanging in there. As I was nearing the summit, I saw the clouds moving in. Alas, by the time I reached the weird tower on top with the curving walkway, the clouds had settled in. No views. Bummer. I had to deal with the same trail conditions as yesterday. In fact, there was even more ice. I hiked all day in my microspikes. Coming down the back side of Clingman's Dome I was literally walking on a frozen waterfall. The trail was bare rocks covered with 2-3 inches of solid ice. Sticks and Hummingbird (both of whom I hadn't seen since GA) both took falls on the ice. Luckily, no harm done in either case. My pack is still heavier than I'd like and appears to be bigger than many out here. However, it's a balancing act between weight on your back and comfort and safety. Case in point - microspikes. If you remember, I tried reducing weight by carrying a 20 degree hiking quilt and had a couple of pretty miserable nights. I am definitely willing to take the weight penalty for my 15 degree mummy bag. The other highlight of the day was crossing the TN/NC state line at Newfound Gap. For the next couple of days we will bounce back and forth between the two states. Newfound Gap is a big attraction for tourists from Gatlinburg. When I arrived, I was amazed to see hundreds of tourists milling about. I guess it's Spring Break for a lot of school systems. Many of the thru hikers were catching rides down to mountain to Gatlinburg for the night. Although the gravitational pull of Gatlinburg was pretty strong, I continued climbing out of Newfound Gap toward the shelter. I was amazed at the number of tourists who were coming down the trail since the trail was very muddy and icy. They had hiked up to he trail only to discover there were no views to be had today. And most of them were in tennis shoes. There must be someone in Gatlinburg that sells bear bells (those are the bells people put on their packs to let the bears know they are coming so the bears can prepare to eat them). Everyone had bear bells on their packs! And the smell of perfume, cologne, and deodorant was overpowering. After you've been away from it for awhile, you realize just how much smelly stuff people wear. After a long climb, I finally arrived at the shelter. Marguerite, Chris, and I actually stayed at this shelter 20 years ago when we hiked this section during Chris's UT Spring Break. We got caught in a snow storm and had woefully inadequate sleeping bags. It was pretty miserable at the time. Now it's fond memories. The 12 person shelter has 13 people in it tonight, so we are pretty packed in. I'm curious to see how it goes...","Siler's Bald Shelter, NC

It was filled beyond capacity and with everyone moving around in their sleep and several snorers, it was not a very restful night. Luckily, tonight will be the last night I am required to sleep in the shelter, since I will be exiting the GSMNP tomorrow. Today was my longest day yet on the AT - 19.8 miles. This had to do with the locations of the shelters. It was either going to be a 12 mile day to the first shelter or a 19 mile day to the second. I reached the first shelter at 2:00 pm, which was too early to stop. So it became a 19 mile day. Luckily, trail conditions moderated considerably. There was only ice near the beginning of the hike. After that, rising temperatures caused all the ice to melt. So, I ended up hiking in Standing water most of the day. I have to say, the trail maintainers do an excellent job throughout the park. I spent the entire morning with my head in the clouds - literally! I couldn't see 30 feet ahead of me. Every now and then, a great expanse of white would present itself off to the side of the trail, hinting at yet another incredible vista I missed. Now don't get me wrong, the woods are beautiful. They are all lush, damp, mossy forests filled with evergreens. The woods have the feel of the Forest Primeval, where at every turn you expect to see some mythical creature, such as a fairy, wood sprite or Minotaur frolicking in a misty glade. Or possibly Sir Gewain jousting with the Green Knight. However, the brochure promised me dazzling views. I want my views. Somewhere along today's route, I passed the 220 mile mark. That means I have completed 10% of the hike. Well, that's a sobering thought, That means I have 90% left! I keep from getting overwhelmed by the immensity of the hike by breaking it into bite size chunks. Tomorrow - Standing Bear Farm and resupply. Friday - Hot Springs, NC and a zero day. In between - hike, set up camp, filter water, cook, journal, sleep. Lather, rinse, repeat. In the afternoon the sun finally broke out and provided the promised views. It was the needed boost to complete this long, long hike. I am now lying in the shelter with 10 other hikers listening to thunder and rain pattering on the tin roof. So much for views tomorrow.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557305,"3/22/17 Groundhog Creek ShelterMiles hiked: 247.2, Miles to go: 1942.6Today was an interesting day in which I ran the gamut of emotions. During the night we had a real gully washer of a storm pass through. High winds, thunder and lighting, and rain pounding on the tin roof of the shelter. The shelter has an upper and a lower deck and sleeps 12. I was on the upper deck,   so the roof was about 18 inches above my head. Needless to say, the rain was loud. Along with all the shuffling, snoring, coughing, etc, of 11 other people, it was another restless night. A couple people got up at 6 AM, so pretty soon the whole shelter started getting up. I think we were all ready to get the day started so we could finish the Smokies and get to Standing Bear Hostel for resupply. I actually started hiking with my headlamp before sunrise. Of course, when the sun came up, I was hiking in a cloud. Again. At least it wasn't raining. If you will remember, we hiked along the ridge bisecting the park at elevations exceeding 6000 ft. When we entered the park, we climbed up to the ridge. Today we descended. For miles. Going downhill sounds easy. It's not. Think about going down uneven log stairs with 12-15 inch drops. For five miles. On top of that, last night's thunderstorm had turned most of the trail into a waterfall. My knees and wet feet weren't happy. On the way down, I passed Mt Cammerer trail. The AWOL guidebook says the 0.6 mile hike to the overlook is definitely worth it since it is the best view in the park. I could see about 20 ft ahead of me with the mist. I kept on hiking. As I descended, the forest slowly transformed from the Forest Primeval, to the Rhododendron Forest, back to the eastern hardwood forest we had been hiking in before the Smokies. As the mist slowly dissipated, so did the feeling of the mystical forest. Finally, after miles of dropping in elevation, I reached the end of the Smokies. To be quite honest, it was a bit of a letdown. As I had said, I break the trip up into bite sized chunks and the Smokies had been a benchmark since the beginning of the trip. Now they were done. I was in a bit of a melancholy mood and the sound of traffic whizzing along I-40 as I exited the Smokies just added to the feeling. The AT actually passes under I-40 before climbing steeply back up the hill on the other side. The first fifty feet are a steep set of uneven steps. I looked at those steps. Then I looked at the highway sign pointing toward Knoxville. For the briefest flash of a second I thought all I had to do was stick my thumb out and inside 90 minutes I could be in Knoxville, where I could grab my Jeep and be home by nightfall. I looked back at the steps, cinched down my shoulder straps and started climbing. Because I'm a thru hiker, and that's what thru hikers do. After 0.7 miles of climbing, I reached the gravel road leading to Standing Bear Farm Hostel. As I approached the hostel, I could hear music playing and people laughing. When I arrived, I saw several people I hadn't seen since before the Smokies, such as Tiptoe, Buddy Al, and Jam. And I saw many of the people I had traversed the Smokies with, such as Lumberjill, Strider, Big O, Winter, Boots, and J. And I saw a bunch of friends I hadn't met yet. We all bought enough food to get us into Hot Springs on Friday and bought frozen pizza and sodas to eat while we recharged our phones. It was a delightful time. The sun was shining and it was warm as we all recounted our adventures traversing the icy, snowy, misty Smokies. The highlight of the day was the box I received in the mail. There's a bit of a backstory, so bear with me. My mother has a friend in her quilting group named Charli Fulton who will be starting her thru hike in April. While Marguerite and I were visiting my mom before I started my hike, we had lunch with Charli so we could talk about our upcoming hikes. Charli brought along some homemade biscotti that her friend had made for her to take on the trail. As the conversation evolved, I discovered that her friend, Tony Abatjoglou, is a former co-worker that I have known since 1993. When Tony found out that I was hiking the AT, he baked a batch of biscotti for me and Charli arranged to have them sent to Standing Bear Farm for me to pick up. I was polite and shared a couple with some people; however, I am coveting the rest to have with my evening tea for the next several nights. Thanks Tony and a Charli!.After completing our business at the hostel, Lumberjill, Strider, and I started the 5.7 mile climb to the summit of 4263 for Snowbird Mt, where we planned to camp in the field near the FAA tower. Fueled by pizza, friendship, and sunshine, we made quick work of the climb. In fact, we made the climb so quickly, we decided to continue to the shelter, which was two miles further on. We arrived at the shelter to find about 20 other people here. Since we are no longer in the Smokies, I can return the I my cozy and quiet tent. Yay. I know this has run long; but, I will relate one more humorous thing that happened today. Just after I left the Smokies, I came upon a couple of dayhikers hiking with their teenaged son. They were engrossed in conversation and did not hear me approaching. I discreetly made noises such as shuffling my feet and clacking my walking sticks to let them know I was there. Finally, I said ""it's a nice day, huh?"". Well, the woman screamed and jumped a foot in the air. She then started laughing and said they had been talking about bears. I, of course, had to give her my best bear impersonation, which made us all laugh. Just another encounter on the AT.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557404,"3/23/17 Walnut Mountain Shelter, NCMiles hiked: 260.3, Miles to go: 1929.5It was a beautiful day to be on the AT. We awoke to clear skies and full sunshine. Since we were only going 13.1 miles today, I kind of took my time packing up and, as a result was one of the last people out of camp. Strider and Lumber Jill were long gone by the time I got started and I didn't see them again until I reached the shelter this evening. That was OK, though. It was a day for hiking my own pace and enjoying the sunshine. Today's hike included another AT icon - Max Patch. Max Patch is a huge grassy bald that was originally cleared years ago for cattle grazing. The cattle are long gone; but, the area has become such a draw for hikers and tourists due to its incredible 360 degree views that it is now maintained against the encroaching forest. Getting to Max Patch turned out to be a real leg burner - log steps (I hate log steps!) and pitches so steep I was walking on my toes with my heels off the ground at times. The climb was definitely worth it, though. Max Patch was incredible! You could see row upon row of mountains going off in all directions. If you are ever in Western NC, add it to your ""must see"" list. Don't worry, you can drive almost to the summit. I almost committed an error on Max Patch that would have haunted me the rest of my life, though. First, some background. The AT is marked all the way from Georgia to Maine with 2x6 inch white paint patches, usually painted on trees or posts, called blazes. That's how we know we are on the right trail. Trails that intersect with the AT, such as trails to shelters or water sources, are marked with blue blazes (as in ""where in the blue blazes are we!?""). Other terms have arisen, such as ""yellow blazing"" - that's when you skip a part of the trail by getting a ride (derived from the yellow lines on the road). Or pink blazing - that's when a guy alters his pace (either speeds up or slows down) in pursuit of a girl. Then there's aqua blazing, which is canoeing the 30 mile portion of the Shenandoah River that parallels the AT in Virginia. Anyway, those hikers that do not yellow blaze or slack pack (that's when you get someone to shuttle your pack forward and you hike a section with just a daypack) are known as Purists. Purists have to hike past EVERY white blaze. Often there are two blue blazed trails leading into a shelter - one from the northern approach and one from the southern approach. A Purist will enter and leave a shelter on the same trail so as not to miss any white blazes on the AT between the two trails. In the end, it's all about ""Hike Hour Own Hike"". If you want to yellow blaze - fine. If you want to slack pack - fine. If you want to pink blaze - fine. You may take some good natured ribbing (unless you are just being a jerk and a nuisance to the girl), but fine. If you're a Purist - fine. Other hikers may think you are a little too uptight about the whole thing, but fine. You guessed it - I'm a Purist. Now back to Max Patch. When you near the grassy summit, the trail runs up the middle of the clearing with occasional white blazes on sign posts. I climbed up the steep trail to the summit to where a bunch of other hikers were hanging out enjoying the view. I happened to look down the slope to my left and saw a long curving line of white blazed posts leading around the edge of the grassy area before turning to the summit where I stood. I had missed the AT and inadvertently taken a short cut to the summit! Imagine my horror and chagrin! I immediately went back down the short cut and followed the curving path of the AT to the summit. As you can imagine, I was good naturedly ribbed for being such a Purist. At least I will sleep the blessed sleep of the Innocent tonight knowing I didn't miss any white blazes. The rest of the hike was a nice rolling trail generally trending downward from Max Patch. A good portion of the trail paralleled a beautiful rushing mountain stream. I hiked a good portion of this section with Winter, a young lady from NYC who recently graduated high school and will be starting college in the Fall. We had a nice discussion about our families and the woods vs the city which helped the miles pass. Of course, the final 1.3 miles of today's hike was uphill - it's always uphill it seems . I am now camped in my tent at Walnut Mountain Shelter with about 20 other hikers. The wind is roaring up the mountain, my tent is shaking and the guy lines are buzzing in the wind. It will be a brisk night. That's alright because tomorrow we reach Hot Springs, NC and a much-needed zero day after completing the Smokies. It's been a week since I've showered.

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557524,"3/24/17 Sunnybank Inn, Hot Springs, NCMiles hiked: 273.4, Miles to go: 1916.4Town Day - woo hoo! We all come out here for our own reasons; but, a part of it for all of us is to get away, on some level, from current society. However, we are all drawn in by the towns. After seven days in the woods, a town visit was long overdue. In town, you don't have to filter water, sleep on the ground, or poop in a hole. Life in town is a brief respite from the rigors of the trail. After being one of the last out of camp yesterday, I actually hauled my butt out of my sleeping bag and was packed up, done with breakfast, and ready to hike by the time the sun came up. We started the day with a big climb right out of the shelter. Although I was the first one out, Whistler caught me halfway up the hill and T-Rex was right behind him. At the top of the climb, I stopped to catch my breath and give Marguerite a quick call. Lumber Jill showed up just as I hung up, so we started hiking together. Lumber Jill is a 5' 4"" powerhouse who worked for the Minnesota Conservation Corps before she decided to hike the AT and then go back to school for her Master's Degree. She gets her legs churning with this hybrid walk-run step and it takes a full stride of my 36"" inseam legs to keep up with her - barely. However, I was ready to get to town and the miles always go faster when you have someone to talk to, so I tucked into her slipstream and drafted off of her all the way to Hot Springs. We covered the 13.1 miles in less than five hours. As we caught sight of the town in the valley below us, all conversation ceased and we were like two horses who've scented the barn and doubled down to get to town. Hot Springs is a genuine trail town where the AT goes right down Main Street. About 10% of the town is populated by former thru hikers. It appears that most of the town's income derives from the thru hikers. There are several hostels and B&Bs, a good outfitter store, and two restaurants in town that cater to the thru hikers. With the bad weather in the Smokies last week, the thru hikers have sort of piled up into a mini-bubble. So, everyone was scrambling last night to make reservations. I generally try to make reservations ahead; but, I had made plans to go visit family in Durham that fell through at the last minute when I found out that all the car rental companies require an actual physical credit card to make reservations. I am carrying a debit card and I have my credit card loaded in my iPhone to use with ApplePay, so no one would rent me a car. All of a sudden, I also needed a reservation. I knew that Rooster, who was a day ahead of me, was staying at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn. So, I called and had him check with Elmer. Luckily, they had had a cancellation, so I got in. Woo hoo!When we reached town, Lumber Jill and I parted ways because she was staying at another hostel; but, on my way to Elmer's, I caught up with Strider and found out he was staying at the same place. Cool! It took us a bit to find Elmer's because it is a pretty low key place. So, we asked a guy on the street who was an obvious thru hiker (zip-off tech pants and puffy jacket) and he pointed us in the right direction. Elmer's is this really cool Victorian house, built in the 1840s, that has been housing thru hikers since 1948, when Earl Shaffer, the very first thru hiker passed through here. Earl, a WW II vet, undertook the first thru hike to ""walk off the war"" (I highly recommend his book, Walking with Spring). They have a brass plaque on the door of the room where he stayed proclaiming ""Earl slept here"". Elmer's assistant Matt, a 2016 thru hiker, greeted us and gave us the introductory tour, accompanied by Pearl the cat, who took her tour guide duties very seriously. Pearl's brother Earl and Jimmy Carter the dog round out the rest of the staff. After the tour, the first order of business was a long, hot shower. Next came a trip to the laundromat to try to beat our stinky, smelly clothes into submission. After that, Strider and I finally got some lunch at the Smoky Mountain Diner across the street. The rest of the afternoon was spent drying out and repairing equipment, checking in at home, and resting our legs. I rounded out the day by having dinner with Rooster at the diner, where we caught up on each other's adventures through the Smokies. Rooster is heading out tomorrow, so it was nice to get a chance to touch base with him. I am now sitting in a rocker on the front porch finishing up my blogging duties to keep you, my faithful readers, up to date. Tomorrow, we are taking a zero day to rest our legs after our tough push through the Smokies and over Max Patch and to resupply. Sunday morning, Strider, Lumber Jill, Winter, Legs, T-Rex, Darwin, Truck, Oz, Machine, Jam, Tiptoe, Half-price, and the rest of our ragtag band will continue our northbound odyssey to Mt Katahdin, looking forward to our next town day in Erwin, TN.","Walnut Mountain Shelter, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557617,"3/25/17 Hot Springs, NCMiles hiked: 273.4, Miles to go: 1916.4Zero day. A day to rest your legs and get your town chores done. I awoke to the smell of breakfast cooking. When the bell rang, we went to the dining room where Elmer and Matt had laid out quite the spread - eggs, biscuits, brown gravy, grits, homemade granola, and melon. Before we could eat, we had to answer these questions: our real name, our trail name, where we were from, what we did before the trail, what we planned to do after the trail, and who in history we would like to hike the trail with. Elmer is quite the interesting host, a former Methodist minister, organic chef, Inn master, curmudgeon, and man of the world. It was an interesting breakfast. After breakfast, I took care of chores. Figuring out how many days hike to Erwin, TN, how much food I'd need, sorting through the pack and sending items such as micro spikes home, and resupplying for the upcoming days. In the afternoon, Strider, Lumber Jill, Winter, Legs, Darwin, and I went to the hot springs for which the town is named and soaked in mineral water for an hour. It was amazing how much better my legs and feet felt after the soaking. It appears to be a pretty nice group that I have fallen in with for the time being. They are all young enough to be my kids; but, I appear to be accepted as part of the group. I appear to be on the younger side of the older hikers and hike faster than most of them (except for Rooster, of course), so I find myself surrounded by younger hikers. There's this other element of hikers that I'm beginning to see on the trail that I think of as The Traveling Circus. It's this group of hikers that don't appear to be focused on getting to Katahdin. They are more focused on being out here having a good time and getting high. They were at the Alpine Inn, a fleabag motel on Main Street, last night hanging out, being loud, and giving thru hikers a bad name until late into the night. Unfortunately, I have seen a couple young hikers that I've met getting caught up in that scene. I just have to remind myself that I am not their father and let them hike their own hike. The rest of the afternoon was spent in long term planning. It appears that I will probably come off the trail at Atkins, VA around Easter to do the move to Knoxville. Then, I will return to the trail in early May. After dinner, I hung out with the group for awhile at the Laughing Heart Hostel and then went back to my room to get ready to head out on the morning. I'm beginning to get antsy to get back on the trail. I think I do better with Nearo days rather than Zero days. Tomorrow, Strider and I plan to have breakfast at the diner and hit the trail by 8 AM or so. Rain is forecast for the late afternoon, so we'd like to be settled into our tents before the rain arrives. The rest day has been good for my body; but, now it's time to start heading north again. Those mountains aren't going to climb themselves!","Elmer's Sunnybak Inn, Hot Springs, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557768,"3/26/17 Allen Gap, NC Stealth SiteMiles hiked: 288.2, Miles to go:1901.6Prior to starting this endeavor, one of the things I wondered about is what would happen if I got sick on the trail. Well, today I found out. I had a pretty restless night at Elmer's and when I awoke in the morning, I ached all over. The very thought of dragging myself out of bed and packing my pack seemed too exhausting to contemplate and the smells of Elmer cooking in the kitchen downstairs turned my stomach. It took about an hour and a lot of sitting on the edge of the bed just sort of staring at my pile of equipment,; but, I finally got my things all organized and packed. I contemplated talking to Elmer about spending another night; but, he had made it clear upon check-in that there was a two night limit. He said he instituted that rule because he's learned over the years that people tend to get caught in the vortex and not leave if they are allowed to stay on longer. I'm sure that, under the extenuating circumstances, he would have made an exception; but, I did not want to stay in town any longer. After a day and a half, I really had the urge to move on. I settled my bill, put on my rain gear (of course, it had to be raining), shouldered my pack and headed out into the rain to the diner across the street. Even though I wasn't really hungry, I felt I'd better try and eat something. I joined J, Push On, and Buddy Al at their table. They all had these big breakfasts with eggs, sausage, pancakes, cinnamon rolls, etc. The very thought of eating any of it turned my stomach. I ordered plain toast and apples and was only able to eat about half of it. I decided to go ahead and start hiking because I knew I was going to be really slow. Every joint in my body ached and I felt like I was walking in molasses. By this time, it was obvious that I also had a low grade fever. Of course, Mr Paramedic was carrying antiinflamitories, antibiotics, antihistamines, antiemitics, and antidiarrheals; but, no antipyretics. I took an antiinflammitory and made a note to pick up some aspirin at my next resupply. As I headed out of town, Lumber Jill caught up to me. We crossed the bridge over the French Broad River and began the long climb up the steep switchbacks on the rock cliffs on the other side of the river. Going uphill was quite exhausting, and we had a lot of it today. Lumber Jill was obviously worried about me because she hiked much slower than usual and took many more rest breaks to keep me in sight. I finally convinced to go on and that I'd see her at the shelter. Luckily, the rain didn't last long and the sun actually broke out and it was a pretty day. Before long, Rash and Piñata, a brother and sister hiking pair from PA passed me. Then Glim Glom, Hummingbird, Wet Wipes, Darwin, Legs, and Strider all came by in short order. Everyone commented on how bad I looked and that I should have stayed in Hot Springs. I continued to trudge along through the day and finally reached the shelter at 11 miles. Everyone was there and debating pushing on. The problem was the shelters were either at 11 miles, which was generally too short, or 19 miles, which was too long, especially after just coming out of town, which are harder days in general. It was decided to push on another 3.8 miles to Allen Gap, which showed a water source in the guide. I contemplated staying at the shelter; but, I didn't like this shelter. It sat in a gap with a lot of wind and there were no flat tent sites. I did manage to nibble on some food, which made me feel a little better. While eating, I realized that I had hiked all day with my shirt inside out. I'm sure that added to my pitiful appearance. Most people set out while I was eating. Lumber Jill, Winter, and Oz were debating only going another two miles to Deep Gap rather than pushing on to Allen Gap. I hiked with them as far as Deep Gap; but, then decided to push on to Allen Gap since it was mostly downhill. By the time I reached Allen Gap, I was feverish and pretty swimmy headed. Everyone else had already taken most of the flat spots for their tents. So, I just sat there for awhile, trying to muster enough energy to look for a tent site. Eventually, I got off my butt and found a site on an old forest service road that ran next to where everyone else was camped. Big O and J arrived and joined me on the road. It's not a perfect site; but, it will do. I still wasn't hungry; but, I forced myself to eat dinner because I knew I needed the calories. When Bo, an anthropology professor at Duke, saw me shivering by the fire in my long pants and down jacket when everyone else was sitting around in shorts, he gave me two aspirin for now and two for later. I was so exhausted by the time I hung my bear bag that I crawled into my sleeping bag and immediately fell asleep, even before taking off my glasses. It is now the next morning and, after a good night's sleep, I think I feel pretty good this morning. Hopefully, it was just one of those 24 hour bugs. We'll see what the day brings...","Hot Springs, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557886,"Flint Mountain Shelter, NCMiles hiked:307.0, Miles to go: 1882.8The plan was to hike an 18.8 mile day today. That would leave us a 14 mile day, a 13 mile day, and a 6 mile Nearo into Erwin, TN. I woke up feeling pretty good today. My fever broke during the night and I actually was hungry. I had concerns about an 18.8 mile day, though, since I had been so sick yesterday. I figured I'd go to the Jerry's Cabin shelter at 12.0 miles and evaluate. It was a pretty morning and I was the third person out of camp behind Big O and J. They like to hike for a few miles and then stop for breakfast. We had a pretty big climb to start the day, so it wasn't long before Oz, then Lumber Jill, and then Rash and Piñata passed me. I've gotten used to being one of the slowest people in my current hiking group. I am also 20-30 years older than all of them. I could feel some residual soreness in my hips and knees and I was also a bit concerned with my hydration state after hiking with a fever all day yesterday. So, I drank lots of water and took it slow. Pretty soon Strider, Darwin, Legs, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes, and Honey Badger came flying by. They had all waited until Mom's Store, which was located 200 ft from where we camped in Allen's Gap, opened. Apparently, it wasn't much of a store; but, they had beer and candy, so those guys were happy. Everyone was concerned and asked how I was feeling today, so that was cool. Today's hike turned out to be more difficult than expected. The climbs were long and there were a couple parts than ran along an exposed ridge that involved a lot of rock scrambling. It was beautiful but tough. At one point during the exposed ridge hike, I looked back and could see the mountains being swallowed by rain clouds. Just as I finished the exposed section, the rain began to fall. I trudged on through the rain, pretty worn out from the long term effects of whatever crud I had had and the rock scramble across the ridge. As I neared the shelter, I was passed by T-Rex, Tip Toe, Scout & Scoutmaster, and Machine. They were all hiking in the soft rain without shirts on and had tied bandanas around their heads and had stuck rhododendron leaves in them to look like feather headdresses. Scout didn't have a headdress since he's a dog; but, he had rhododendron leaves sticking out of his panniers. They had looked like Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. When I arrived at the Jerry's Cabin Shelter, I was pretty tired and had decided to stay. All the others that I started the day with had moved on to the next shelter. As I sat there resting, the rain stopped and the sun came back out. I also watched T-Rex and Tip Toe bantering back and forth. I like both of them; however, the T-Rex and Tip Toe Show starts to get a little old after awhile. The funny thing is, I knew and liked everyone at that shelter; but, they weren't the people I've been hiking with the past few days. I looked at the map and saw it was 6.7 miles to the next shelter. I looked at my watch and saw it was 4 pm. I could be there before dark if I pushed it. The sun was back out and I had my second wind after sitting there awhile and having a snack. So I girded my loins, cinched up my pack and headed out. It was a long climb up Big Butt Mountain (that's the real name of the mountain); but, it was a longer descent down the other side. So, I was able to stretch out my legs and I made it to Flint Mountain Shelter a little after 7 pm - just enough time to set up my tent, get water, cook dinner, and hang my food before dark.When I arrived I was met with a chorus of ""Beaker!"", ""Glad you made it, man!"" When the sun went down, we all sat around the fire talking until about 9:30 pm. It was a push; but, I'm glad I went for it.","Allen Gap, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557990,"Low Gap Campsite, NCMiles hiked: 321.9, Miles to go: 1867.9Today was a leisurely day on the trail. We were only hiking 14.9 miles, so no one was in a real hurry. It's funny how our perspective is already changing - anything less than 15 miles is an ""easy"" day. Luckily, the crud I suffered from two days ago is a distant memory. It rained all night; but, thanks to my Zpacks Altaplex tent, I stayed warm and dry. The rain continued on and off during the day. When it wasn't actively raining, the trees were all dripping water. So, we stayed wet most of the day. At times I felt like I was back in the Smokies, with the mist and lack of views. Leisurely is a bit of a misnomer. We had all looked at the elevation profile and saw that we had to cross over just a couple of climbs. It's pretty funny how we can fool ourselves. Those climbs turned out to be pretty tough! The first one went on forever! At least we hiked next to a very pretty stream with lots of waterfalls for quite awhile. I had started out with Lumber Jill, Winter, Oz, and a guy who joined us last night named 1st Sergeant - he seems pretty cool. I stopped to post my blog and they got ahead of me. I spent the rest of the morning trying to catch up to them and was surprised how far ahead they got. After 7.5 miles, I reached the shelter and stopped for lunch. By then, the rest of the group, who had lounged around camp because of the short hike, had caught up. I was surprised that Lumber Jill and the others I started the day with weren't there. It turns out they had all stopped at a hostel we had passed along the way. I had been chasing them all morning and they were behind me!After finishing lunch, I headed back out. I reached the intersection of the AT and shelter trail just as Lumber Jill arrived. She was struggling today because she had hiked a 21 mile day yesterday since she had stopped earlier than the rest of us on Sunday. She walked behind me and let me set the pace. Sometimes when you are struggling, it's good to hike with someone else and let them set the pace. All you have to do is hike and let the conversation help the miles pass. As we hiked, the rain finally stopped and blue patches began to appear in the sky. We crossed under I-26 and began our second big climb of the day. We hiked through a couple of high mountain meadows that were really pretty. By now, the weather had cleared enough that the views were really nice. Of course, all the fast hikers that had lounged over lunch passed us again. We finally arrived at our camp site for the evening. Since it wasn't at an actual shelter, everyone had to set up tents. Unfortunately, there are more tents than flat campsites. I am on a bit of a slope, so I will be sliding down in my bag all night. Not ideal, but not totally horrible either. We all sat around after dinner and talked. I found out that Glim Glom is also a chemist and an EMT. What a cool coincidence!This little group I've fallen in with is pretty interesting. Darwin is definitely the leader. He carries himself with the confidence and grace that comes from being a former collegiate athlete. He's about 25 and looks like he stepped right out of Outside or Backpacker magazine or maybe GQ. His girlfriend Legs is a former volleyball player from CA with black hair and legs that are befitting of her trailname. They are the protons of the group. The rest of the group are the electrons swirling around them. Strider, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes and Honey Badger are all twenty something men that are like inner shell electrons that are tightly bound to the protons and will not be pulled away from the nucleus. Then there are the outer shell electrons: Lumber Jill, Oz, Winter, and me. We are not as tightly bound to the nucleus. Depending upon the chemical reaction, we may be pulled away from the nucleus. For example, I know that when I reach mile 544.0, I will be going off-trail for a couple of weeks and probably won't see any of the group again. The others are all young women who aren't as concerned about being part of the group. For example, Lumber Jill, Oz, and Winter all stopped earlier on Sunday night and camped at a different spot. However, all three hiked 21 mile days and caught back up yesterday. It will be interesting to see how little long this group stays together. Little things (some good, some bad):Waking up to sunshine. The smell of a pine forest. The way the leaves get skewered on the end of your hiking poles. The satisfaction of stepping just right on the edge of the poles to dislodge the leaves without breaking stride. The sound of voices and laughter at the end of the day that tells you you have finally reached the shelter. The constant sound of jets in the distance that reminds you the rest of the world is still out there. The sea of mountain peak after mountain peak as far as the eye can see.","Flint Mountain Shelter, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558103,"3/29/17 No Business Knob Shelter, TNMiles hiked: 336.5, Miles to go: 1853.3Today was a great day on the trail. Although, I think the earth must have shifted on its axis during the night. My tent was on a 2-3 degree slant when I went to bed; however, it must have shifted to a 20-30 degree slant after I fell asleep. I inchworm slept all night. I would wake up at the lower end of the sloping tent, would pull myself back up, fall back asleep, and wake up in a heap at the bottom of the tent again. Not the most restful...We awoke to full sunshine and warm temperatures. I hiked all day with First Sergeant. What a great guy! He's a thirty year US Air Force veteran who is about my age. We talked all day about our kids, grandkids, wives, careers, etc. Although I really like all the young adults I've been hiking with, it was nice to talk with a contemporary. As an added bonus, we hike the same pace. We started climbing straight out of the campsite and climbed for quite awhile. Near the top of the climb, the trail got pretty rough and rocky. We finally reached the top of the climb and found ourselves on an open bald. What a surprise! We all had somehow missed in the guidebook that we would be crossing a bald. It was beautiful, with 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. It was every bit as pretty as Max Patch. First Sergeant and I were the first ones there since we were the first out of camp. Soon Lumber Jill, Darwin, and Oz joined us. We all just hung out for awhile taking pictures and enjoying the full sunshine. The rest of the day was spent in conversation and hiking on pleasant trail that had more downhill than uphill. We still had a couple of pretty big climbs; but, I think the trail legs are beginning to kick in. They weren't too bad. I decided that we were having such a good day that we were destined to have trail magic when we crossed US 19 at Spivey Gap. I told Oz, Lumber Jill, First Sergeant, and Legs about my premonition when we all stopped at the same place for lunch. Alas, when we reached Spivey Gap - no trail magic. Bummer. First Sergeant and I continued hiking in the warm sunshine as the rest of the crew passed us one by one. We did come upon Lumber Jill sitting on a log having a snack about 4 miles before the shelter. So, the three of us finished out the day hiking together, discussing plans for a town day in Erwin, TN tomorrow. We reached the shelter about 4 pm and found several nice, flat spots for our tents. Yay. After we had eaten and were cleaning up, Machine arrived. He had hiked a 21 mile day to catch up. The first thing he said was, ""Hey, did you guys get some of that trail magic at Spivey Gap?"" I knew it! I knew there was going to be trail magic at Spivey Gap! Apparently, the person arrived right after we passed through. Bummer. Maybe next time. In a little while, Winter, who also put in a 21 mile day, arrived. There are now about 12 - 14 people settling in for the night. Some of them in the shelter and some of us in tents. Tomorrow - a six mile hike into Erwin, TN. Town day - yay!Little things (all good):Town day!Good conversation making the miles disappear. Spring flowers beginning to appear. Rushing mountain streams. Second graders who have chosen my blog for their 20 minute daily reading assignment.","Low Gap Camp site, NC

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558194,"3/30/17 Uncle Johnny's Hostel, Erwin, TNMiles hiked: 342.7, Miles to go:1847.1Town day! We woke up to clear skies and moderate temperatures. We were only hiking 6.2 miles today; but, we were headed to town. So everyone was up early and ready to go. Lumber Jill headed out while I was still eating breakfast, so no drafting off of her like I did into Hot Springs. First Sergeant and I headed out together. We both stopped when we got phone signal to post our blogs and call our wives, allowing most of the crew to pass us. One tough climb (the climbs are getting easier though!) and a couple of steep ups and downs along the ridge and then a three mile drop into Erwin, TN. We started catching glimpses of town and the Nolichucky River. It's always cool when you start seeing town. After what seemed like a quick descent, we were at Uncle Johnny's Hostel on the Nolichucky River, or just Uncle Johnny's for short. I hadn't made any arrangements to stay because the rest of the group was planning to resupply, eat town food, and head out to the shelter five miles past town. First Sergeant had reserved a ""cabin"" at Uncle Johnny's (they're really just private or semi-private rooms as opposed to the bunkhouse). He offered to let me stay with him if I wanted. I was waffling about whether to stay or not until I heard the weather forecast - thunderstorms and a high wind advisory overnight. They were able to change his room from a single to one with bunk beds, so I was set. Uncle Johnny's is another one of those icons on the trail; but, as usual, it's about what you'd expect for $25/night. Plus $5 for a shower and $5 to wash clothes. First Sergeant and I got checked in and took showers. The rest of the crew took showers before heading out to hitch hike to Walmart to resupply. Meanwhile, a bunch of other hikers we knew showed up: Big O, J, Jam, Courtney, T-Rex, Tiptoe, Hummingbird, Irish, Scout and Scoutmaster, and Ramsey Bolton (and, yes, all you Game of Thrones fans, he does have a resemblance to Ramsey). I was especially pleased to see Right Move, whom I hadn't seen since the NOC. Only, now he's back to being Molasses, which was his original trail name before Right Move - its complicated. And there were a bunch of hikers I'd never seen before. Also present were the Traveling Circus, the three hiker trash guys I had last seen in Hot Springs, where they had been kicked out of the Laughing Heart Hostel for cleaning out the hiker box. Every hostel has a box, known as the hiker box, where people can place things they don't need, like extra food, fuel canisters, clothes, toilet paper, etc. It's up for grabs for whoever needs it. The first thing you do when you arrive somewhere new is check out the hiker box for cool stuff you just can't live without. These guys weren't staying at the Laughing Heart. They were passing through and raiding the hiker box. Anyway, these guys were now at Uncle Johnny's doing work-for-stay. Sometimes, if you don't have enough money, hostels will allow you to clean bathrooms, etc, in place of paying. These guys obviously are hiker bums yellow blazing their way up the trail, hanging out and partying at the hostels. I mean, they are nice enough guys. It's just not my idea of hiking. Hike Your Own Hike, I guess. At 12:30 pm, seventeen of us piled into a 15 person shuttle van and went to the all you can eat (AYCE) pizza buffet. AYCE is a very important word for thru hikers. After stuffing ourselves with pizza and resupplying at the IGA across the street, we piled back into the shuttle and returned to Uncle Johnny's. Lumber Jill and the rest of the crew were there and getting ready to head out. I really hated to see them leave. I have so enjoyed hiking with that group; but, I respected that they were trying so save money by moving on quickly. It's so easy to overspend when you stay in town. We still needed to wash clothes. Uncle Johnny's only has one washer and dryer and the dryer did not appear to be working. I found out there was a laundromat in town, so I decided to rent a bike ($2) and ride to the laundromat. It was kind of funny. Everyone was amazed that I was going to ride 4 1/2 miles to the laundromat. First of all, I'm an avid cyclist who routinely rode my bike 8 miles to work, not to mention thousands of other miles on road, gravel, and mountain bikes. Second of all, I've just walked over 340 miles to get here!I went to the stable of rental bikes and picked out my ride. It was an ancient, rusted Specialized Rock Hopper with a Bell comfort seat and a loose kickstand. At one time it had been a noble steed. Now, it looked as though it should be relegated to the glue factory. Nevertheless, I set out for the laundromat with my and First Sergeant's dirty clothes in a borrowed book bag (it was included in the cost of the bike rental) on my back. The AWOL guide has a map of the town, so I knew where to find the laundromat. Unfortunately, when I arrived, I found it closed - as in ""Out of Business"" closed. I asked a couple of women I saw across the street and they directed me a mile up the road to the other laundromat. I found it right where they had said and proceed to wash our clothes. As I was folding our clothes, I realized that I had less than 45 minutes to get back to the hostel to catch the 5:30 shuttle to the Mexican restaurant for dinner. So, I jumped back on my trusty steed and started pedaling back, only to discover that the Weather Channel was right on the money with their high wind advisory starting at 5 pm. You guessed it - a strong headwind all the way back! Fortunately, after much hard pedaling since only about half the gears worked, I arrived back at the hostel with 9 minutes to spare. With the arrival of many more guests, 24 of us piled into two vans for the trip to the Mexican restaurant and subsequent shopping at Walmart. We are now back in our ""cabin"" listening to thunder and wind outside. I hope Lumber Jill, Strider, Darwin, Legs, Oz, Winter, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes, The Machine, and Honey Badger are all safe and sound in the shelter tonight. It sounds like a bad night to be on top of a mountain.","No Business Knob Shelter, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558329,"3/31/17 Cherry Gap Shelter, TNMiles hiked: 358.8, Miles to go: 1830.0It rained most of the night, with a line of thunderstorms moving through around midnight. 1st Sgt and I slept well in our small room. Although, it was a bit stuffy. We were up around 7 AM and checked out and on the trail before 8 AM. We were aiming for a campsite about 12 miles away. The first post-town day is usually pretty rough. You are carrying three or four days' worth of food, you invariably have to climb out because most of the towns are in river valleys, and you usually feel sluggish from eating too much town food. On top of all that, it was a wet, blustery day. So, 12 miles seemed about right. We left the hostel under threatening skies, crossed the river, and headed into the woods. The trail crossed the railroad tracks and wound along next to the Nolichucky River for quite awhile before starting up the hill along a babbling mountain stream. It was actually a fairly pleasant walk until the skies opened up and immediately soaked us. 1st Sgt and I continued to slog through the rain as we climbed out of the river valley. We've found that our paces are quite compatible and that our personalities are even more compatible. So, walking and talking, even in the pouring rain is quite enjoyable. So much so that we arrived at the Curly Maple Shelter, about 4.7 miles from Uncle Johnny's, much earlier than expected. When we arrived at the shelter, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes, and Honey Badger were still packing up. As we all stood under the shelter waiting for the rain to slacken, the guys told us that the group had had a veritable feast last night with all the food they had carried out of town. They also told us they were headed to a campsite another 17 miles away, which was farther than 1st Sgt and I planned to hike today. So, we bid them farewell and told them to give our regards to the rest of the group. We then took a few minutes to check in with our wives while waiting for the rain to slacken. Once the rain let up, we continued on our way. Today's hike was mostly uphill; but, it wasn't bad at all. We spent the day in conversation about deep subjects like ""Marianne or Ginger?"" (definitely Marianne). We continued to learn about our shared interests like Scouting, books, and music. We didn't see many people out on the trail today, three section hikers and a trail runner. We arrived at our planned stopping point at 2:30 PM, which was way too early to stop for the day. So, we decided to press on another 5 miles up over Unaka Mountain to the Cherry Gap Shelter. It was a 1200 ft climb to the top of the mountain; but, the top of the mountain was covered with this really cool thick spruce forest. 1st Sgt commented that it looked like a ""Hanzel and Gretel"" forest, so we started watching for a witch's house made out of candy. No such luck!When we arrived at the shelter, we were pleasantly surprised to find Lumber Jill, Winter, and Oz at the shelter, along with three other hikers named Maps, Stache (both guys), and Ringer (a middle aged woman). I think 1st Sgt and I were were both pretty happy to see ""our girls"" again. It had turned quite blustery and chilly, so we didn't waste time setting up our tents, changing into warmer clothes, and fixing dinner. I am now in my tent listening to the wind roar and raindrops splat against the side of the tent. I am safe, warm, and dry. I love my little tent. Tomorrow we enter the Roan Highlands!","Uncle Johnny's, Erwin, TN

It rained off and on during the night and by morning everything was damp and dripping. After breakfast, 1st Sgt and I headed out. As usual, all the younger hikers passed us in short order as we did our home check-in with our wives.It was gray and foggy all morning. Our hike was generally climbing today as we made for Roan High Knob Shelter. At 6100 ft, it is the highest shelter on the AT. Since it was Saturday, we saw lots of day hikers and section hikers. The coolest thing to happen today was we ran into Rooster, Hydrator and Hydrator's girlfriend slackpacking southbound. Slackpacking is when you hike with a small pack, carrying just food and water. They knew they were going to see us today, based on my blog. So, they made two extra sandwiches for us. Sweet! Trail magic!We stopped at the Clyde Smith shelter to eat our lunch, where some southbound section hikers told us about trail magic at the next road crossing. A family was grilling hot dogs. We headed out for the road, which was about 3 miles away. As we approached the road, 1st Sgt and I could smell hot dogs grilling. Apparently, North Carolina has some sort of flower or bush that gives off a grilling hot dog scent because, when we arrived, there was no one grilling hot dogs. Bummer. We had missed the hot dogs; however, the trail angels had left potato chips and sodas. We were quite happy with those. The salty chips and sugary sodas were just what we needed because we were getting ready to start a 5 mile, 2500 ft climb to the top of Roan High Knob. Over the next three hours, we climbed and we climbed and we climbed. We climbed up smooth, well graded trail. Then we climbed on rocky trail. Then we climbed on rocky, wet, muddy, steep, rooty trail. Part way up the climb, 1st Sgt got a message from his wife that he had dropped his wallet. Ringer, whom we had met at the shelter last night picked it up, found his wife's phone number in the wallet and called her. Whew, that was a close one! Ringer will bring it to him at Mt Harbour Hostel. The only problem is that we are moving faster than her, so we will have to take a zero day to wait for her to catch up.   About two miles before the shelter, we came upon Winter sitting on a log. She said she was having trouble with her leg hurting; but, she planned to push on to Overmountain Shelter, which was an additional seven miles past Roan High Knob. Darwin and Company were all there and she wanted to catch up. We encouraged her to stay with us. She said she'd think about it and promised that if she decided to push on she would stop at the shelter and let us know. 1st Sgt told her that if we hadn't heard from her by nightfall, we were going to come look for her. The sun finally broke out about 4 pm and it turned into a beautiful afternoon. However, over 6000 ft, it was very windy and cold. We arrived at the shelter and found that it was a fully enclosed cabin with a loft. We set up for the night in the loft. It is snug, dry, and warm and we are out of the bitter wind. Winter arrived and informed us that she was pushing on to the Overmountain shelter and planned to night hike with her headlamp until she arrived. 1st Sgt and I were sad to hear she was pushing on; but, neither one of us is her father, so there wasn't much we could do. I did get a text from Lumber Jill saying that she had stopped at Stan Murray shelter, which is a couple of miles before the Overmountain shelter. I told her to keep an eye out for Winter, so hopefully Winter stops there. We had another hiker named Jeeves join us in the loft. He is a pleasant young man we'd never met before. We all shared dinner and caught up on each other's hikes and passed along trail gossip about who's where along the trail. Tomorrow is supposed to be sunny and in the 70s. We will also be passing over some very scenic balds. It should be another glorious day.","Cherry gap shelter

I think that it stayed dark in the loft of the fully enclosed shelter, so we slept later. By the time we ate breakfast and packed up, it was going on 9 AM. We headed out in full sunshine and warmer temperatures than when we went to bed. After 1.5 miles of hiking, we reached Carter Gap and the beginning of several miles of open balds on the Roan Highlands. It was a gorgeous day with full sun and highs in the 70s. Being such a beautiful day and a weekend to boot, we saw tons of weekend hikers, including a physical education class from Appalachian State University. One student and I had a friendly disagreement over whether Appy State or WVU are the ""true"" Mountaineers. I think we all know the answer to that one!1st Sgt and I were enjoying the balds and talking to other hikers so much that we kind of dawdled a little longer than we planned. At one point, we talked to a Southbound section hiker who told us that he had met Winter at the Overmountain Shelter this morning. We were both relieved to hear that she had made it to the shelter last night (yeah, we can't help ourselves - we are both dads). We stopped for lunch at Stan Murray Shelter, where we shared the picnic table with a young woman from Green Bay named Big Rocks and a German woman from Trier named Powerhouse. We had actually met her the night before last and she had been very excited to find out that, not only was I familiar with her hometown, I had visited it. After lunch, we stopped in to check out the Overmountain Shelter. It is probably th coolest shelter we've seen so far on the AT. It is an old barn that was converted to a shelter by the Tennessee Eastman Hiking Club in 1983. It sleeps about 30 people and has incredible views of the valley below and the balds above. It even has incredible views from the privy, which doesn't have a door or a roof and only about 4 foot high walls, so you get the full view of your surroundings during your morning Constitutional . When we checked the shelter register, we found that Winter had left us a note letting us know she had made it safely to the shelter at 10:20 pm the previous evening. After visiting Overmountain Shelter, we still had about 7 miles left to hike and two big climbs over Little Hump and Big Hump and the afternoon was slipping away. So, we got down to business and started hiking in earnest. The climbs over the Humps were tough; but, soon enough, we were starting the five mile descent to US Rt 19. The descent was pretty rocky at first; but, the farther down the mountain we came, the more the treadway smoothed out. At mile marker 390.7, we crossed the TN/NC border for the final time. We have been flitting back and forth across the border since the Smokies. We have finally bid NC farewell for good. Two states down and 12 to go. We finally reached US Rt 19 and hiked 0.3 miles down the road to the Mountain Harbour B&B and Hiker Hostel. 1st Sgt's wife had made reservations for us yesterday after she found out that Ringer had found his wallet. We are going to zero here tomorrow and wait for Ringer to arrive with the wallet.   They had already quit serving dinner from the food truck; but, we were able to buy frozen pizza, sodas, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream in the General Store, so we were set. The proprietor, Shannon, showed us to our room in the main house and even cooked our pizza and washed our laundry while we showered and cleaned up. The rest of the evening was spent in pleasant conversation with Shannon and one of the other guests. They are calling for thunderstorms and 1-2 inches of rain tomorrow, so it will be a good day to take a zero. I just hope Ringer can make it over the Humps tomorrow to deliver the wallet...","Roan High knob sheltet

We were pretty late rolling in last night after hiking 16.3 miles, so we really didn't have a Nearo yesterday. We awoke to the smell of breakfast cooking and headed downstairs for coffee and tea while David, the proprietor, finished preparing breakfast. Just before 8 AM, the boarders from the bunkhouse arrived. We were actually staying in a room in the main house, thanks to 1st Sgt's wife making reservations. Breakfast was quite the spread - biscuits, gravy, sausage, ham, eggs with perogies, hash browns, fruit, home made cinnamon rolls, apple pastry, and more! We all ate our fill while the Weather Channel played in the background, telling us to expect 1-2 inches of rain today. After breakfast, we made calls to our wives and children and cleaned and dried our gear. Pretty soon, as promised, the rain arrived. It poured, and poured, and poured. We got at least 2 inches of rain and the creek in front of the house rose high up its banks. During the maelstrom, 1st Sgt got a call from Ringer. She had crossed the Humps in high winds and rain and had arrived at US Rt 19 with his wallet. Yay!The rest of the afternoon was spent planning out the next portion of our hike and talking to Shannon, David's wife, and other hikers. I also enjoyed hanging out with Rose, Robert, and Mokie the dogs and Petunia the cat. For once I didn't get antsy to get back out hiking in a zero day. I guess pouring rain will do that. We had lunch and dinner at the food truck they run in front of the hostel. David's lunch and dinner offerings were as good as the breakfast. The sun broke out in late afternoon and the rain receded. We should be good to head out in the morning, although I suspect the trail may be pretty sloppy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone passing through - not just hikers. I'm already making plans to come back with Marguerite in the Fall when the leaves start changing.","Mountain Harbour B&B, TN

Waah! It is now after 10 pm - 2 hours past Hiker Midnight. So, I will apologize in advance for this briefer than usual account. We left the Mountain Harbour B&B after another huge breakfast, walked the 0.3 miles along US Rt 19 to the trailhead and started climbing. Post-Zero Day hikes are always tough because your pack is heavy, you always start out with a climb, and you are always sluggish from too much town food. Today's hike was no exception. Actually, the hike did not really have any huge climbs and the weather was beautiful. So, it was a great hike. We didn't have any great views today; but, we did pass several really cool waterfalls. 1st Sgt and I were joined today by Bo. He is the hiker who gave me aspirin when I was sick after Hot Springs. He's about our age and hikes about our speed. We were passed by several of the younger hikers today, including Courtney, Hummingbird, Ramsey Bolton, Sitting Bull, Krampus, Captain, and several others I do not know. We are all camping together at the shelter tonight. We will all be at the Boots Up Hostel tomorrow. Due to aggressive bear activity, the next shelter has been closed and a six mile section does not allow camping. This section occurs right about where we would finish up tomorrow. Luckily, the hostel is perfectly positioned. In fact, 1st Sgt and I have speculated that in true Scooby Do mystery fashion, the owner of the hostel is probably dressing up in a bear suit and scaring the locals in an attempt to keep his hostel full. (""I would've gotten away with it too if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!""). They are also calling for thunderstorms tomorrow evening. It sounds like a good time to be indoors again. After a large climb tomorrow, the rest of the way into Damascus, VA looks pretty smooth. We hope to be through with TN and entering VA by the weekend.","Mountain Harbour B&B, TN

We fixed breakfast, broke camp, and headed out by 8:15 AM. 1st Sgt, Bo, and I hiked out together and were quickly passed by the rest of the pack. Based on the elevation profile, we expected a fairly gentle hike. Wrong again. We had a fairly steep hike out; but, it finally settled down and was a rolling hike. A quick aside about Bo. He is a professor of anthropology at Duke. I assumed his name was an allusion to Bo Duke, as in Dukes of Hazzard. It seemed a bit low brow for a college professor. It turns out that his actual trail name is Bard Owl because he was enthusiastically extolling the virtues of the Bard Owl one night around the camp fire. As happens with many trail names, Bard Owl got shortened to B.O. He didn't particularly care for the connotations of that name, considering how bad we all smell. So, it eventually became Bo. The clouds moved in fairly quickly; but, the rain held off. Our conversation ranged from Native cultures, to AT culture, to Doolittle's raid on Japan, to hiking the Camino trail in Spain. Once again, the miles passed quickly. We arrived at a road crossing and saw a sign for Kincura Hostel. It is run by AT trail legend Bob Peoples. 1st Sgt wanted to stop by and meet him, so we headed up the road. Bob Peoples has worked on the trail for years, leading trail maintenance crews. He is also a retired Major in the USAF. 1st Sgt was like a kid in a candy store. He and Bob talked Air Force for quite awhile; but, with bad weather moving in, we finally decided we needed to move on. We then went through the best part of the hike today - the Laurel Fork Gorge. The Laurel Fork roared through the gorge and the trail ran right next to the creek. At one point, the trail was a two foot wide ledge wedged in between the cliff and the creek. Epic! We also had a nice flat section along the the creek for several miles. Then the climb up Pond Mountain began. It was not a particularly difficult climb; however, it WAS a particularly long climb. We gained 2000 ft over 2.5 miles. And then the wind began. We had a few raindrops, so we stopped and put on our pack covers; however, the rain never really materialized and, eventually, the wind settled down. Much ado about nothing. We then descended for two and a half miles - much better than climbing. When we reached the bottom, we took a left turn on the road and came to Boots Off Hostel. It's a fairly new hostel; but, Jim and company appear to have their act pretty much together. After showering and getting cleaned up, 10 of us piled into the Hiker Hauler - a really cool lifted Suburban - and got a shuttle to town for food. Most of us ended up at McDonald's (yeah, I know that ""food"" is a pretty liberal description of what you get at McDonald's) where I learned about a brilliant culinary masterpiece from Hummingbird - the McGang Bang. For the uninitiated, you pull apart a McDouble and put a McChicken Sandwich between the two patties and smash it all together. It is incredible! I probably couldn't eat it in real life; but, it's amazing what you'll eat when Hiker Hunger kicks in. The problem is that you cannot carry enough food to replace the number of calories you expend walking 15-18 miles a day. So, when you hit town, you eat large amounts of food to compensate, i.e. Hiker Hunger. Ramsey Bolton actually bought 14 McDoubles to eat on the trail for the next two days. We are now back in our room at the hostel. 1st Sgt, Bo, and I are all sharing a room. It's a bit tight; but, after sharing shelters you kind of get used to it. It was originally supposed to just be me and 1st Sgt; but, Bo somehow missed out on the whole Bear and Bad Weather thing. So, by the time he called the hostel, they were completely full. We talked to the owner and he was fine with Bo crashing in our room, so all is well. The storm front is expected to move through tonight, with falling temperatures all day tomorrow and snow forecast for Friday. It may make the hiking interesting...","Moreland Gap Shelter, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559039,"4/6/17 Iron Mountain Shelter, TNMiles hiked: 442.9, Miles to go: 1746.9Winter is back! We headed out from Boots Off in a light rain this morning, so we all put on our rain jackets. The rain quit. We got warm and took off our jackets. The rain started again. Bummer. The rain then settled into a cold drizzle that went on all morning. We spent the first couple hours of our hike along the shores of Watauga Lake. It was fairly flat and quick hiking. We finally crossed over the dam and started to climb. And climb. In fact, the rest of the day was pretty much spent climbing. We also spent most of the day hiking along the ridge above Watauga Lake. It is a big lake. As we climbed, the wind started picking up and continued to blow fiercely the rest of the day, with gusts up to 30-40 mph. And the temperature started to drop. We stopped for a quick lunch at a shelter; however, we quickly got chilled. So, we added a couple of layers of clothes and started hiking again to get warm. Then, the rain turned to ice pellets and sleet before finally turning to snow. The wind was blowing so hard that the pellets hitting our faces really stung. Our conversation would drag as we put our heads down and hiked into the wind. Then, 1st Sgt would ask a random question of me or Bo to get the conversation going again. We continued in this fashion all afternoon as the ground slowly turned white. Somewhere along the line, we decided that we didn't want to have to set up tents in the snow. So, we planned to sleep in the shelter. The only problem was that we expected all the younger hikers to pass us at any minute and take all the shelter spots. Our only hope was that they procrastinated long enough this morning due to the rain that we beat them to the shelter. At one point, Courtney passed us hiking south. She had made arrangements to spend another night at the hostel and slack pack today. As we neared the shelter, our hopes of getting shelter spots increased. We stopped to get water, expecting Hummingbird and all the other young guys to come around the corner any minute. We decided that if they showed up we would hike three abreast and not let them pass. And trip them with our hiking poles if need be. We arrived at the shelter around 4:00 pm, before the young guys. Yay. There were already three hikers here; but, the shelter sleeps six. So, there was room for all of us. We quickly changed out of our damp clothes and jumped into our sleeping bags to warm up. Sitting Bull, Krampus, Ramsey Bolton, and Hummingbird eventually arrived; but, decided to hike on farther. Once we warmed up, we eventually climbed out of our bags and fixed dinner. Over dinner, we got to know Capernicus, Glass Legs, and Gentle Ben. All three young guys appear to be pretty cool. We are all now settled in our bags and ready to sleep. Unfortunately, I have to pee. Bummer.","Boots Off Hostel, Hampton, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559349,"4/7/17 Abingdon Gap Shelter, TNMiles hiked: 458.8, Miles to go:1731.0(Sorry for the delay in posting this account. I heard from four people wondering where my post was. I had the entire thing written last night and when I went to post it when I got signal this morning, my frozen fingers hit the wrong button and deleted the whole thing. I will try to recreate it to the best of my ability now.) First of all, people let's get one thing straight. Many people asked me if I was still wearing my kilt with the return of winter weather. If you will recall, the one day I did not wear my kilt on this entire trip was the worst hiking day I have had. So, from now on, just assume that I am wearing my kilt, irregardless of weather. We awoke to winter weather once again. There was only about an inch of snow on the ground; but, high winds and temperatures in the 20s made for a pretty cold night. We had snow blowing into the shelter on us all night. Actually, I stayed pretty warm; but, 1st Sgt said he got pretty cold. Even though we had spent 15 hours in our sleeping bags, no one appeared to be in a hurry to get up. Finally, Capernicus and Glass Legs, two of the guys we met when we arrived at the shelter, got up, packed up, and headed out. Bo, 1st Sgt, and I quickly followed suit. Gentle Ben, the third hiker, was still in his sleeping bag when we left. The worst part was that our boots had frozen during the night and were almost impossible to get on. It took several miles of walking before we warmed up and our hands and feet, not to mention our boots, thawed out. It had quit snowing during the night; however, we continued to have high winds and overcast skies all morning. Luckily, we were undulating along a ridge and having interesting conversation, so the 7.6 mile hike to Double Springs Shelter passed quickly. It was strange to look down in the valleys and see green fields and blooming trees. Winter appeared to only be up on the ridge tops where we were. We stopped for lunch at the shelter and shared it with a southbound section hiker from Mt Storm, WV, named Bluecoat. We all ate quickly and headed back out before we got too chilled. During the afternoon hike, the sun finally made an appearance and the temperatures rose into the 40s, causing the snow to melt. The high winds also finally gave out and it turned into a fairly pleasant afternoon. Bo, 1st Sgt, and I make a pretty good team. I somehow always end up in front, setting the pace, and the other guys always come up with interesting topics to keep the conversation as lively as our hike. At one point in the afternoon, Courtney passed us. She had resumed her hike at the point where she had been dropped off for her southbound slack pack yesterday. She was planning to push all the way to Damascus tonight and quickly left us behind. We continued to plod along at our regular old guy pace. When we arrived at Abingdon Gap Shelter, we discovered that our two companions from last night that had headed out before us were not at the shelter, as we expected. It appears that they also had decided to hike on into Damascus. So, the three of us had the shelter to ourselves. The funny thing was that all three of us decided to set up our tents since the snow had melted and this shelter had plenty of good tent sites around it. After setting up our tents, we went to get water. The spring was a LONG way down the hill from the shelter. When you are at home, you take for granted how easy it is to turn on the faucet and get either hot or cold water. Out here, any time we want hot water, we have to take time to walk to a water source, filter the water, walk back to the shelter, set up our stove, and heat the water. The thing is, as inconvenient as it is, we are doing this out of choice. There are millions and millions of people who have to work much harder than this to get clean water every day. We sometimes forget how good we have it. Tonight is Bo's last night on the trail. He only planned to do the a section hike from Springer to Damascus and is meeting his wife tomorrow. We decided to build a fire in honor of his last night. We had an enjoyable evening of easy conversation - three old friends sitting around a campfire. It's amazing how quickly friendships form out here. Bo and 1st Sgt are now in asleep in their tents and I am finishing my blog next to the dying embers of our campfire. Tomorrow we will hike 9.9 miles into Damascus where I have not one, not two, but THREE packages waiting for me. Town Day! Yay.","Iron Mountain shelter, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559350,"4/8/17 Broken Fiddle Hostel, Damascus, VAMiles hiked: 469.2, Miles to go: 1720.6We awoke to clear skies and cold temperatures. Surprisingly, last night seemed much colder than the wintery night in the shelter. We also had an almost full moon that lit up my tent like a night light. Bo, 1st Sgt, and I fixed breakfast, using up pretty much all that remained of our food. Hikes into town are generally pretty good. Your backpack is lighter because your food bag is empty, you are generally hiking downhill, and all the delights of Town Day await. This is an especially exciting day because, not only are we entering one of the most iconic towns on the trail, we are finishing off another state. The AT runs right down the main street of Damascus, VA. This town embraces thru hikers more than any other town on the trail. Every May, Damascus hosts Trail Days, a three day homecoming for thousands of thru hikers which includes food, music, parades, vendors booths from all the outdoor companies, big and small, and a whole host of other activities. Our hike was tinged with a bit of sadness, though. Even though we had only hiked with Bo for a few days, we really hated to see him leave. The three of us had formed a pretty tight bond over the past few days. I think Bo was having mixed feelings about leaving the trail. On the one hand, he was excited to see his wife and get back to a major project he had in the works. But, on the other, I think he heard the voice of Mt Katahdin, ever so softly, calling to him to continue on with his newfound friends. About 8 miles into the hike (which wasn't nearly as downhill as we'd expected, by the way), we arrived at the TN/VA state line. Crossing state lines is always exciting. It's a tangible demonstration of forward progress. We stopped and took selfies and posted to Facebook like a bunch of teenagers. Finally, we arrived in Damascus and followed the trail under a wooden arch built by an Eagle Scout, through the town park, and down the main street, where the trail is paved in bricks, many of which were purchased and placed by supporters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. After meeting Bo's wife and wishing him a fond farewell, 1st Sgt and I found our way to the Broken Fiddle Hostel, where we stashed our packs before heading out to collect our packages. 1st Sgt had a resupply box and I had three boxes. I had a box sent by my daughter Amanda which contains three days worth of dehydrated organic hiker meals. They look delicious. I also had a box from Marguerite that contained my credit card and a batch of blonde brownies. Yum. And, finally, I had a box from my former co-workers at Mylan that contained all kinds of goodies. Thanks guys! We had way more food than we could possibly carry, so we shared some of our bounty with fellow thru hikers at the hostel. Boy, were they excited! Hummingbird aptly described my friend Sue's Snookies as ""heroin in foil wrappers"". We were able to accomplish all our town chores - resupply, shower, laundry, and eat town food. We also saw several hiker friends that we haven't seen in awhile: Engine & Caboose, Jam, Molasses, and Sticks, to name a few. As a result, we've decided to just take a Nearo and head out of town tomorrow. We are headed for the next AT icons - the wild ponies at Grayson Highlands!","Abingdon Gap Shelter, TN

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559514,"4/9/17 Lost Mountain Shelter, VAMiles hiked: 485.0, Miles to go: 1704.8Today's hike started out good, got better during the day, and ended up awesome this evening. I woke up about 7:00 AM and discovered that 1st Sgt was already up and showered. We headed out a little before 8:00 AM and found out that Hummingbird, Ramsey Bolton, Courtney, and Sitting Bull were heading to In the Country Cafe for breakfast. It was right on the AT, so we joined them. The food was pretty good; but, the service was slow. So, it was almost 9:30 AM before 1st Sgt and I got started hiking. We either hiked on or next to the Virginia Creeper Rail Trail most of the day. It was a beautiful sunny day, with temperatures reaching almost 80 degrees. It's hard to believe that two days ago we were hiking in Winter. We still had all the post-town day elements to deal with: heavy pack, belly full of town food, and mostly uphill hiking all day. But, it was such a beautiful day and such a beautiful region that we had a great hike. We stopped at Saunders Shelter for lunch, where we met a thru hiker named Uncle Heather. He was a fairly flamboyant man with fading green hair (St Patrick's Day?) whose claim to fame appears to be winning several drag queen pageants in Baltimore. He was a fairly interesting man. I did finally find out about Alexa from him (remember her from the very beginning of the trail?). She is now going by the trail name McFlurry and is about four days ahead of us. We came upon a neat pond in the woods and spent several minutes watching small fish and the biggest, fattest tadpoles I've ever seen in my life. These things were four inches long! Some of them had developed their back legs. It was so cool!We continued to plod up the trail toward Lost Mountain Shelter. Both of us were feeling a little tired; but, were really enjoying the day. I think the 40 degree change in temperature was really wearing us down, though. At one point, we stopped for water and our conversation went something like this:1st Sgt: ""No one ever thinks about routine things like filtering water when they think about hiking"".Me: ""Yeah, I know what you mean""Him: ""It's like Gilligan's Island - they always have water"".Me: ""Yeah, you pretty much have to suspend disbelief with Gilligan's Island"".Him: ""Like Wrongway Feldman"".Me: ""Or the musical group that left them there because they thought the women would be too much competition"".Him: ""Yeah, or the...""Me: ""Um, Sarge, wait... Consider this - Bo has only been gone a day and we've reverted to conversations about Gilligan's Island"".Him: ""Ha, ha, ha. Well, I guess we know who the true intellectual is"".We arrived at the Lost Mountain Shelter around 6:00 pm. Uncle Heather and two women section hikers were the only people there. We were kind of surprised. We expected to see all the rest of the group here. As we were setting up our tents, Courtney came bouncing into camp with a slack pack. Her parents had come to visit and were bringing her regular pack to the shelter. It was located only a mile from the road. When her parents arrived, along with her pack, they brought pizza, sodas, chips, bananas, and brownies. Score! We all ate until we were stuffed. I contributed the blonde brownies that Marguerite had sent me to the party. Unfortunately, I did not manage to reduce the weight of my food bag much. Pretty soon Hummingbird and Sitting Bull arrived and joined the party. It was great fun. In the end several other thru hikers and section hikers arrived and made a mini tent city. To top off the evening, Hummingbird produces a cribbage board. He totally skunked me; but, it was great fun. We are now sitting around a campfire telling ghost stories under a full moon. Virginia has been great so far and we haven't even seen the ponies yet.","Broken Fiddle Hostel, Damascus, VA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559659,"4/10/17 Thomas Knob Shelter, VAMiles hiked: 497.3, Miles to go: 1692.5Today's hike turned out to be tougher than any of us were expecting. We awoke to another beautiful day as the sun came up. Uncle Heather was already gone. Hummingbird, Courtney, and Sitting Bull all took their time getting up since they were only hiking 12.3 miles to Thomas Knob shelter. 1st Sgt and I were planning to go 17 miles to Wise Shelter, so we headed out right after breakfast. We descended 1.5 miles to Rt 58 and then the climb started. It was a 2000 ft climb to the top of White Top Mountain. It wasn't too steep; but, it went on forever. As we ascended, we began passing Boy Scouts in various states of distress as they were struggling up the trail with tragically heavy packs. We found out that it was a troop from Northern Virginia out for several days to earn their 50 Miler badge. After an interminable climb in the steadily rising temperatures, we reached Buzzard Rocks. The rest of the scout troop was at the rocks waiting on the stragglers. The open bald around the rocks was as pretty as any we've seen so far. We could see row upon row of mountains marching off in all directions. We descended to another road crossing at Elk Garden, where we stopped for lunch. At this point, we began to realize that the heat and climbing were beginning to wear on us. We knew we had to climb back up to Mount Rogers (the highest peak in VA), so we began to entertain the thought of stopping at Thomas Knob Shelter, which was just below the summit of Mt Rogers, rather than pushing on to Wise Shelter if the climb turned out to be bad. The climb turned out to be bad. It wasn't too steep; however, it was extremely rocky. With close to 500 miles on our shoes, they are beginning to break down. So, we felt every rock and root. As we climbed, the trees began to thin out and the land began to take on the open character that I so love about the Grayson Highlands. We also began to see piles of poop and tiny hoof prints in the mud that spoke of the presence of the feral ponies for which the Grayson Highlands are famous. As we approached Thomas Knob shelter, 1st Sgt and I both agreed that the climb had beaten us up enough that we did not wish to go any further. When we reached the shelter, we were met by four ponies - a stallion and three mares. The ponies were very tame and very much interested in licking the salt off of us and our packs. There may have been an apple or two that got shared with the ponies also. Pretty soon, the Boy Scouts arrived and the ponies followed them to the tenting area. Since there were 16 scouts and several leaders, they pretty much filled the tenting area. So, the thru hikers all decided to stay in the shelter. It is a double decker shelter that sleeps 16. Hummingbird, Courtney, and Uncle Heather are sleeping on the top level and 1st Sgt and I (who have been dubbed ""The Dads"" by the younger hikers) are sleeping on the lower level. Standing Bull is cowboy camping outside the shelter. Although it was a pretty tiring day and we didn't make as much mileage as we'd planned, seeing the ponies easily made up for the pain and effort of the climbs. Also, although Hummingbird whipped me at cribbage again, he didn't manage to skunk me this time!","Lost Mountain Shelter, VA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559812,"4/11/17 Stealth Camp, VAMiles hiked: 516.5, Miles to go: 1673.3I awoke this morning to the clip-clop of little hooves as five ponies arrived at the shelter. A couple of the bolder ones even stuck their heads in the shelter to check on us. I suspect the ponies make regular visits to the shelter at breakfast and dinner time. After visiting with the ponies and eating our breakfast, 1st Sgt and I packed up and got ready to head out. As usual, Courtney (now called Brie), Hummingbird, and Sitting Bull took their time getting ready since they all hike so fast. Surprisingly, Uncle Heather had not headed out before daybreak as is his usual habit. He was complaining of a migraine and decided to stick around and sleep a little longer. 1st Sgt and I headed out into another beautiful morning. We hiked across the stark beauty of the Grayson Highlands, with its open balds, rocky outcrops, and row upon row of mountains marching off into the distance. It makes me think of what the Scottish Highlands must look like. In fact, at one point, I climbed upon a rock outcrop to get better cellphone signal to call Marguerite. A section hiker we met yesterday passed by and she commented that I looked like a Scottish Clansman standing on the rock in my kilt with the rising sun backlighting me. I imagine the cellphone in my hand kind of dashed the illusion. We saw many more ponies as we hiked across Grayson Highlands and saw many section hikers out enjoying the scenery. We were both pleased to find we could easily fit through a rock formation called ""Fatman Squeeze"" that the trail passed through. We were also pleased to pass the 500 mile mark on our hike today. We are nearing one quarter of the trail completed!We both remarked on how much better we felt today compared to yesterday. I guess we are getting used to the heat, plus the elevation changes were much more gradual than yesterday. That's good, since we needed to make up about five miles that we didn't hike yesterday. We stopped in at Wise Shelter for a late morning break and saw in the shelter register that Darwin & Company had spent the previous night there. I miss Lumber Jill, Winter, and Oz; but, I'm pretty sure we won't ever catch back up with them. We continued our trek across the highlands and finally reached Old Orchard Shelter around 2:00 pm, where we stopped for lunch. We were joined by two brothers, both doctors, and their young-adult children. They were doing a three day hike in the area. It turns out that the brothers, both a little older than me, were originally from Fairmont, WV and one of the brothers lives in Charleston, WV, just a couple of miles from my mom. So, it turns out we know a lot of the same people. They were all such nice people and were very interested to hear details of our thru hike. They especially liked hearing about our rag tag group of hikers that includes two older retired guys, a recent high school grad, a college student, an Army medic just out of the service, and a drag queen. You know, it doesn't seem all that strange until you tell someone else about it. After a nice long lunch and visit, we continued on to our final destination at Hurricane Creek Shelter. We arrived around 5:30 pm; but, we weren't too impressed. It sat on sloping ground and the tenting area was located quite a distance from the shelter. As we talked to the two hikers who were already there, Hummingbird arrived and announced that he was pushing on to the next shelter. Sitting Bull and Brie arrived in short order and said they were also pushing on and that Uncle Heather had passed them earlier and was also pressing on. That's all it took. 1st Sgt and I shouldered our packs and headed out. 1st Sgt and I ended up hiking another three miles before finding a suitable spot to set up camp. We passed Uncle Heather where he'd stopped for the night and Hummingbird, Sitting Bull , and Brie all passed us. We ended up hiking 19.1 miles today, which will make the hike to Partnership Shelter tomorrow much more manageable. We are all making for Partnership Shelter because it's one of the few shelters where you can get pizza delivered to the shelter! Also, 1st Sgt and I are on a tight timeline and the extra miles today made up for the short day yesterday. We are on a tight timeline because we have to be at mile marker 544.0, where the AT passes under I-81, by 4:00 pm on Thursday. We are getting picked up by Enterprise Rent-a-Car and we are then driving to my mom's house in Charleston, WV, where Marguerite will meet us. 1st Sgt will then return the rental car on Friday and continue his hike while I go back to Morgantown with Marguerite to pack our house for the move to Knoxville, TN. After much internal debate and weighing of alternatives, I've decided that when I return to the trail after helping Marguerite get settled in Knoxville, I am going to jump ahead to wherever 1st Sgt is (probably somewhere near the entrance to Shenandoah National Park) and complete the hike with him. I will then return and finish the portion in VA that I missed. As much as yellow blazing a portion of the trail does not fit in with my Purist mindset, I just think that 1st Sgt and I make too good of a team to let that slip away (heck, the younger hikers even call us ""The Dads""). Plus, if I run into a time crunch for any other reason, it would be much easier to finish a portion in VA than in ME.","Thomas Knob Shelter

By morning, the rain had passed; but, the day was overcast and drippy. Oh well, we had beautiful weather in the highlands, so that's all that mattered. 1st Sgt said that someone had passed before daybreak wearing a headlamp. So, we figured it was probably Uncle Heather. We ate breakfast and headed out before 8:00 AM. Our 19+ mile day yesterday had made up for the short day the previous day; however, we had 15.9 miles to Partnership Shelter, so we wanted to get an early start. The shelter is located next to the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area visitor's center. You can have pizza delivered to the visitor's center. We wanted pizza for dinner. Yeah, I know we had just had pizza for dinner in Sunday. But that didn't matter. Partnership Shelter is known for pizza delivery. We had to have pizza. After hiking about five miles, we arrived at Trimpi Shelter and decided to take a break. We've found that short breaks where we take our packs off for 10 or 15 minutes make a huge difference. As we approached the shelter, we could hear Brie, Sitting Bull, and Uncle Heather talking. Hummingbird, who had night hiked the previous evening to reach Trimpi Shelter, had already headed out. We sat and visited way too long. We still had over 10 miles to hike and, at 2 mph we were looking at another five hours of hiking. We were trying to reach the visitor's center before they closed at 4:30 pm because we weren't sure if we'd have cell phone service to order the pizza. The visitor's center has an outside phone for local calls; however, some SOBO section hikers had told us the phone wasn't working. Not to mention, AWOL's guidebook said pizza could be delivered; but, it didn't list a phone number. 1st Sgt and I decided not to stop for lunch and try to push extra hard to make it in time. Of course, we faced a long climb up to the ridgeline and long climbs are not our specialty. Not to mention, the sun finally broke out and the day heated us right up. We hoofed it up the hill and did pretty well for two old guys and were pretty proud of ourselves. We were hot and tired; but, we had shown that mountain who was the boss! When we reached the ridge top and found we had phone signal, I called the visitor's center and got the phone number for the pizza place. As I was on the phone, Uncle Heather, who we had passed at the bottom of the climb eating his lunch, sauntered up the hill like it was no big deal. He wasn't out of breath. He wasn't sweaty. I hate Twenty Somethings! He suggested we go ahead and call the pizza place and set up a 6 pm delivery. Brilliant! I love Twenty Somethings with bright ideas!With the pizza taken care of, we were able to slow down and enjoy the ridgeline hike. We still made it to the shelter by 4:00 pm. Uncle Heather was hanging out at the shelter after sauntering off and leaving us in the dust miles back. He informed us that Hummingbird, Brie, and Sitting Bull had decided to catch a ride into town. 1st Sgt and I decided to go to the visitor's center and find a soda machine. There was a scale beside the soda machine, so I weighed myself and found that I have lost 25 lbs!There was a German couple named Laura and Lucas at the shelter who wanted to order pizza; however, it required a $30 minimum order. It turns out that the outside phone at the visitor's center had been fixed, so we called and added a pizza for them to our order. They were so excited. They tried to pay for their pizza; but, I told them that it was all part of the AT international relations program and would not accept payment. They were even more excited. Additional people showed up at the shelter throughout the evening. We now have 11 people here - American, German, and Danish and are having a good time eating pizza and conversing. Tomorrow, 1st Sgt and I need to hike 11.4 miles, mostly downhill, by 4 pm to pick up our rental car - easy peasy mac and cheesey!","Stealth Site, VA

Partnership Shelter prohibited tent camping, so 13 of us slept in the shelter. With everyone rustling around and snoring and bright moonlight shining into the shelter, I just didn't sleep well. I got up at 6:00 AM and read my book at the picnic table until people started stirring in the shelter. 1st Sgt and I ate a quick breakfast and headed out. We had to cover 12.0 miles to the Barn Restaurant, where we were going to be picked up by Enterprise at 4:00 pm. Covering the mileage in that time wouldn't be difficult; however, we wanted to leave some wiggle room. Plus, we wanted to have time to eat lunch at The Barn before they picked us up. It was another beautiful, sunny day. We had to generally climb for 5 miles up to 4200 ft, then descend the rest of the hike to where the AT crosses under I-81. The treadway turned out to be pretty rocky; but, generally it was an easy hike. We stopped in at the Chatfield Shelter for a quick privy break. It was a fairly small shelter without any good tenting spots; but, it had a nice privy. About eight miles into the hike we started to see signs of civilization, with pretty fields and farmhouses. We arrived at the Virginia Settler's Museum. One of he buildings at the museum is the historic one room Lindamood School, which was built in 1894. There was a female hiker coming out of the school who looked really familiar; but, I couldn't place where I knew her from. I asked her her trailname and she it was Princess. Aha! Now I knew her! Her husband is named Rocketman. I had previously followed their hike on TrailJournals. They were out doing some hiking in the area. What a small world!There was a sign telling thru hikers to stop into the school and partake of trail magic supplied by the local United Methodist church. The schoolhouse was really cool; but, the trail magic was incredible! Iced sodas, chips, fruit, snacks, and a whole range of toiletries. It was the best trail magic we've had yet. Another 2.8 miles of hiking through fields, woods, and meadows brought us to Rt 11. It was amazing to see that, with the drop in altitude and the increase in temperature, Spring had suddenly sprung. There were wild flowers, blooming trees and buzzing insects. It was both amazing and beautiful. Our first stop was the Relax Inn, where 1st Sgt had a resupply box waiting. What a dump! It made the Budget Inn in Franklin look like a Hilton. I would not recommend this place to anyone. We next went to The Barn restaurant, where we had the one pound Hiker Burger. It was huge and delicious. I would recommend this place!After lunch, we were picked up by Enterprise and got a rental car. We then drove to my mom's house in Charleston, WV. We had a fun evening relating stories of the trail to my mom and my sister Becky. Marguerite arrived around 8:00 pm and joined the fun. Tomorrow, 1st Sgt will return the rental car and resume his northward journey. Marguerite and I will return to Morgantown and pack up the house for our move to Knoxville, TN. I will be off-trail for 2-3 weeks, but will keep track of 1st Sgt's progress and rejoin him when the house is settled in Knoxville. In the meantime, I will try to post every couple days just to keep the blog going. If you have any questions about the hike up to this point, drop me a note to my guestbook page and I will try to answer them in my posts over the next couple of weeks.

He made it back to Marion, VA, dropped off the rental car, and headed back out on the trail. If you haven't already, you should check out 1st Sgt's blog on TrailJournals.com. My daughter wanted to hear about bears on the AT. When I talk about hiking the AT, probably no subject piques people's interest more than bears. I get all the standard questions: ""Aren't you afraid of bears?"" ""Are carrying a gun?"" ""What about bear spray?"" No, no, and no. The only bears on the AT are black bears, so forget all those movies you've seen about rampaging Grizzlies. And the bear in the ""Walk in the Woods"" movie was a brown bear. However, weighing between 100 - 500 lbs, black bears are still a consideration. Every night, after setting up camp and eating dinner, we all put our food and other aromatic items like trash and toothpaste into a bag and hang it in a tree where bears can't reach them. In Georgia and North Carolina, most of the shelters have bear cables where you just clip your bag to a hook and pull it up in the air. As we moved farther north into TN and VA, the shelters quit having cables for some reason. Now we have to hang our own bear bags. This process involves finding a suitable tree limb, attaching a small bag to a 50 ft piece of cord, finding a small rock to place in the bag, tossing the rock bag over the tree limb, attaching your food bag to the cord, hoisting the bag into the air, and securing the free and of the cord to a tree. Sounds simple. It's actually quite a pain. This process actually provides hours of entertainment - when you are watching someone else do it. It's fun to watch them tramp through the underbrush looking for just the right tree, getting hung up in the greenbrier and other underbrush. Then it's fun watching them find just the right limb - not too high, not too low, and strong enough to hold your food bag. Then they have to find a rock. The woods are full of rocks, right? Until you need one about the size of a tennis ball, or so. Then there are none to be found anywhere! Next they have to toss the bag in just the right arc to sail up and over the limb. This is the most entertaining part of all! There's always that one athlete who can toss the bag in a beautiful arc and drop the cord right onto the limb with ease. However, most people toss the bag again and again, trying in vain to get the bag over the limb. First throw is way too low. Second throw goes too high and gets tangled on a small branch above the limb. They pull on the cord to try to retrieve the bag. It hangs up. They pull harder. The rock bag suddenly comes loose and comes rocketing straight towards their head. They somehow miss getting brained by the rock bag and make a third attempt. This throw is arcing just perfectly! Unfortunately, they are standing on the end of the cord and the bag abruptly stops and comes falling back on their head. Argh!Finally, they get the cord over the limb and start hoisting their food bag into the air. Since they've just resupplied in town, the food bag is very heavy and the cord cuts into their hand. Ouch. They get a friend to help hoist the food bag. Unfortunately, they didn't pick their limb carefully and it breaks, sending food bag, cord, and limb showering down on their heads. Lather, rinse, repeat. They finally get the bag in the air ten feet off the ground and at least six feet from the tree trunk and then comes the debate about how best to tie off the loose end of the rope:""Just tie it around the tree""""No. I've heard the bears have figured out how to get the cord loose.""""That's silly. Bears don't have opposable thumbs.""""They don't untie it! They cut it!""""With their claws!?""""I don't know!""""Maybe they bite the cord...""""Why don't we tie it off using the PCT method?""""Great idea! Do you know how to do the that?""""No. Google it""""I don't have phone signal""""Don't you have Verizon?""""No. AT&T""""You know what they say - No AT&T on the AT.""""You have Verizon. You Google it.""""Can't. We're down in a gap. No signal""""Well, poop!""As you can imagine, people tend to get lazy and begin to stop bear bagging. They decide to hang their food in the shelter instead. This leads to arguments with people who have taken the effort to bear bag. I have heard that by the time you get to New England, no one is bear bagging anymore. The reason that bear bagging is such an issue is that bears are lazy animals. If they can just eat human food, they don't have to spend all day foraging. And once bears become habituated to human food, they don't want to go back to roots and berries and they become aggressive. We have passed through two areas on the trail now that we're closed to camping due to aggressive bears. Unfortunately, aggressive bears usually end up being dead bears. There have been actual bear attacks on sleeping hikers in the Smokies in both 2015 and 2016 and the only fatal black bear attack in the southeast occurred in the Smokies in 2000. So, bears need to be taken seriously. On the other hand, I have backpacked my entire adult life and have never seen a bear in the woods. In fact, I have only talked to one thru hiker who has even seen a bear on the trail this year. So, even though bear concerns are real, I'm not too concerned about bears. Like most thru hikers, I just hope to get to see a bear in the wild.","I-81, Atkins, VA

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560280,"4/15/17 Morgantown, WVMiles hiked: 544.4, Miles to go: 1645.4Got out and rode my bike 20 miles today and discovered that hiking and cycling do not use the same leg muscles! My legs and butt are tired and sore after only a 20 mile ride. At least I got out and moved some. Another question I've gotten is, ""what is your favorite thing about the hike?"" Undoubtedly, it's the people I've met on the trail. I have met a broad range of people, from high school students to retired military personnel, doctors, lawyers, steel workers, Germans, Danes. And the coolest thing is that it doesn't matter who we are off the trail. We are all thru hikers and are linked by the common bond of shared experiences. We've all slept in shelters, pooped in cat holes, had sore feet from rocky trails, hiked in the pouring rain, and been cold at night. We've all experienced the thrill of coming into town to get a shower and eat way too much town food. And we can all pick out another thru hiker from a mile away. We all basically look like homeless people with hiking poles. It's amazing how quickly friendships form on the trail. And you may hike with someone for a day or two and then not see them for another month. As soon as you see them, though, the friendship picks right back up. I have hiked with several different groups over the course of the past seven weeks and know or at least heard of most of the hikers a day ahead of me and a day behind me on the trail. Whenever I go into a restaurant and see a table of thru hikers,I tell the server that I'll just sit with these people. If I don't know anyone at the table, I will soon enough. Since we are all in this adventure together, we tend to watch out for each other. When one of our thru hikers lost his debit card and had no money to buy food, the rest of us made sure that he did not go hungry until he got a replacement card. 1st Sgt is actually well known on the trail for giving food away, especially chocolate. Since the hike takes 5-6 months, it tends to happen at transition points in people's lives. Most people are either straight out of school (or taking a semester off) or retired. You don't tend to see many people in the 30-50 year old range. As a result, you see a bunch of old people hanging out with a bunch of young people - it's pretty cool. Another thing you see a lot of is former-military hikers. Once again, I think the hike serves as a transition from military life to civilian life. In fact, Earl Shaffer, the first documented thru hiker, said he came out here to ""walk off the war"" in 1948. Although there is a lot of age and social diversity on the trail, unfortunately there is very little ethnic diversity. I have met two Asian, three African American, and one Hispanic thru hiker. All the other hundreds of hikers I've met are Caucasian. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has actually implemented programs to encourage hikers of color to join the thru hiker family. We'll see how successful they are with future hiker classes. Another funny phenomenon is how fast information is spread among the thru hiker community. The rumor mill is alive and thriving through word of mouth and shelter registers. We all have heard of Double Barrel, the hiker with the eighty pound pack which contains such things as a solar shower and a camp chair. Or Little Foot, the five year old boy hiking with his mother who snores so loud he wakes up the entire shelter. A constant topic of conversation is who has gotten off the trail and why. Without a doubt, even though the views are incredible and the feral ponies were really cool, it's the people who make the hike.","Morgantown, WV

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560486,"4/17/17 Morgantown, WVMiles hiked: 544.4, Miles to go: 1645.4We had a nice Easter yesterday. Marguerite, my step-daughter Jenny, and I went to Easter service, we came back and walked dogs and started taking pictures off the wall. I think the packing will start in earnest today. I also ordered new shoes and insoles today. The Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners have been working for me, so I ordered another pair. I opted for the low rise instead of the mids to save a few ounces. I expected to get about 500 miles out of each pair, so I am right on schedule. I also plan to switch out my winter gear while I'm home. We are past the Grayson Highlands and it's almost May, so the threat of cold weather is diminished. Leaving behind the winter gear will help reduce my pack weight. The balance of weight vs comfort is a constant consideration and constant topic of discussion. Uncle Heather is an ultralight backpacker. He carries a 12 lb base weight, which does not include food and water. His pack is very small and allows him to hike very quickly. It also reduces wear and tear on his back, legs, and feet. On the other hand, he often gets cold at night because he has a light sleeping quilt (""Pack light, freeze at night""). Although I've never met him, Double Barrel has become a legend on the trail for the enormous pack he carries. He is purported to carry two bear canisters for food storage (hence the name Double Barrel), camp chair, and a solar shower. He also only hikes about 8-10 miles a day because his heavy pack slows him down. 1st Sgt and I fall in the middle between these two extremes. My pack weight is somewhere in the 35 lb range, including food and water. 1st Sgt appears to be about the same. The pack is heavier than I'd like; however, I don't freeze at night. If you will recall, I started out with a 20 degree hiking quilt and had a couple of miserable nights before Marguerite sent me my 15 degree mummy bag. The bag was especially nice when we hiked into winter in the Smokies. Now, the bag is getting a little warm at night, so I plan to switch back to the quilt. I also plan to switch back to my hammock. Although I have been very satisfied with my Zpacks Altaplex cuben fiber tent, I look forward to returning to my hammock. My original plan had been to start out in my hammock; however, since you sleep suspended in the air, you tend to lose much more body heat to convection than you do when sleep on the ground in a tent. As a result, you have to carry additional insulation in the form of an underquilt with the hammock. Of course, the underquilt means more weight. So, in the end, I substituted the 19 oz tent for the hammock. I have been very jealous of the hammockers I've seen on the trail. Hammocks have some distinct advantages over tents. First, you aren't sleeping on the hard ground with roots and rocks under you. More importantly, all you need is two trees with the appropriate spacing. The ground can be sloping, rocky, etc, and it doesn't matter because you are suspended over it. On several occasions I have had to set up my tent on less than ideal surfaces, leading to issues which made sleeping difficult. Even without the underquilt, my hammock and tarp weigh more than my cuben fiber tent. So, I am going to have to eliminate additional weight to compensate. I should be able to eliminate some winter clothes that I won't need anymore. I think I've even got 1st Sgt considering a hammock! Once I get my summer pack lined out, I'll share my gear list.","Morgantown, WV

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560964,"4/20/17 Morgantown, WVMiles hiked: 544.4, Miles to go: 1645.4Packing is in full swing here in WV. We have to be ready to load the truck when my son arrives Tuesday. It's amazing how much stuff you accumulate over time! Marguerite and I are working diligently to get rid of things we just don't need. We have taken two big loads to the Ranch Store, which is a local store similar to Goodwill. We have also given away a lot of furniture and just thrown out a lot of junk. We took a break yesterday and ran up to REI in Pittsburgh. I had to return my air mattress. It consisted of eight long chambers of equal size that held air when inflated. The wall between two of the chambers had separated, leaving six equally sized chambers and one big chamber. Unfortunately, the big chamber was right in the middle, so when I slept on it at night I would roll either left or right, making sleep difficult. It turns out that, since it had been purchased more than a year ago, it was longer covered under warranty. So, I had to buy a new one. I also bought 1st Sgt a Luci inflatable solar light because he had been coveting mine. It's a surprise for when I return to the trail, so don't tell him. Finally, I got my new shoes yesterday! Yay! Since I had such good luck with the Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners, I stuck with the same thing. I did decide to go with the low rise shoes rather than the mid-rise though. I have been keeping in touch with 1st Sgt and look forward to rejoining him on the trail. I just have the small matter of completing the sale of two houses, packing up the house, loading a Uhaul truck, driving to TN, unloading the truck, and putting the house back together before I head back.

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561460,"4/23/17 Morgantown, WVMiles hiked: 544.4, Miles to go: 1645.4The packing continues. We have given away or thrown away so much stuff; but, we still have so much to pack. It's amazing how much stuff two people accumulate over the years. We are making a concerted effort to reduce the amount of stuff we own because we are moving to a smaller house. It's the same struggle I go through with my backpack on the trail - only on a much larger scale. Where's the balance between comfort and weight (or in this case, room in the Uhaul)?As you can see from the picture, I did find time among all the packing to get my hair cut (click on the ""photo"" button to the left to see the ""before"" picture). Most people have been shocked and wondered why, after letting it grow for over two years, I cut it all off. Two words - deer ticks. Everyone always asks me if I'm afraid of bears. I'm MUCH more worried about deer ticks. Most of us are used to seeing the dog tick, about twice the size of a capital ""O"" or bigger. A deer tick is much smaller - about the size of a small ""o"". They are very hard to see under the best of conditions. Giving them a veritable forest to hide in on my head gives them a much greater chance of getting by undetected. The reason I am so concerned about deer ticks is that they carry Lyme Disease. Initial symptoms include fever, malaise, and joint pain. Left untreated, it can lead to a range of neurological issues such as meningitis and memory loss. Chronic Lyme Disease can last for years. With the mild winter, deer tick populations are predicted to explode this summer, especially in the Northeastern US (which happens to be just where I'm walking to). With the exploding tick population will be a concomitant rise in Lyme Disease. Hence, the shearing. I am taking additional steps to reduce potential deer tick exposure. I sent my hiking clothes to a company in NC called Insect Shield which pressure treated them with permethrin, an insect repellent that ticks hate. The protection is suppos d to last for 70 washings. Now that it is warmer, I will check myself regularly for ticks as part of my bedtime wet wipe wash routine. I will also watch for the telltale sign of Lyme Disease, which is a bullseye shaped rash at the site of the tick bite. Unfortunately, this rash only shows up in about 25-50% of the cases. However, if I do find a deer tick or bullseye rash, I will immediately begin taking the prescription doxycycline capsules that I am carrying in my first aid kit and follow up with a medical professional upon arriving in the next town. If I don't see a rash but begin to feel malaise and joint pain, I will probably start a prophylactic dose of doxy anyway. The problem with that scenario, though, is hiking 15-20 miles a day leads to malaise and joint pain on its own! I guess if I have greater than normal malaise and joint pain, I'll go with it. Of course, the other benefits of shearing my flowing locks are that it will be much cooler and easier to manage. No more waking up with a tangled rat's nest that I would have to try to comb out with a small comb just so I could pull it back in a ponytail. No more washing my long hair with questionable shampoo provided by the hostel. Although, the guy who cuts my hair cautioned me that, even though my hair was short, I still needed to ""deep condition"" it once a week. Ha! I'm lucky if I get to wash it once a week!Finally, apparently everyone from my mother to the garbage man has been relieved that I no longer look like a half-crazed homeless guy (Q. How do you tell a thru hiker from a homeless person? A. Thru hikers carry hiking poles.) Although, I did have one co-worker who liked my ""Jerry Garcia"" look. In about 10 days, when I return to the trail, rather than Beaker from Morgantown, WV, I will be the ""new and improved"" Beaker 2.0 from Knoxville, TN.","Morgantown, WV

After several days of hard work and with the help of my son Sam and his friend Dylan in WV, and my step-son Chris in TN, Marguerite and I are finally in Knoxville. The house is still a mess; but, things are beginning to come together. 
With three dogs and two cats, the drive from WV to TN was a long one. The dogs actually did pretty well; but, the cats weren't too happy. Marguerite had two dogs and one cat (in a carrier) in her car and I had one dog and one cat (also in a carrier) in the Uhaul truck with me. We stopped often to let dogs out and we had to stop twice and deal with cats peeing In their carriers. The heavy rain in WV and VA, the  heavy truck traffic on I-81 in VA and TN, and the heavy fog in TN just added to the enjoyment. 
We actually stopped for gas in Atkins, VA, and had dinner at The Barn. That is the very same restaurant where 1st Sgt and I had lunch the day I came off the trail. It was a bit strange to be back around the AT as a non-hiker. I talked to a thru hiker named Jersey Mike while I pumped gas. I told him I was also thru hiking, but had come off-trail to move from WV to TN. He was nice; but, I'm not sure he actually believed me, even after I did the traditional thru hiker fist bump rather than shake his hand. 
I also saw four thru hikers walking from the restaurant back to the Relax Inn. It was funny, I could tell at a glance that they were thru hikers and I'm sure they were all nice people; but, they weren't MY thru hikers. No 1st Sgt, Blood Mountain, Hummingbird, Lumber Jill, or Uncle Heather in the bunch. It just reinforced my decision to jump back on the AT with the people I've been hiking with. 
There are times this past couple of weeks that have left me exhausted and sore. And saying goodbye to our WV friends definitely wasn't fun. But, we are pretty excited to be here in TN. Everyone we've met on our new street has been very friendly and welcoming. Not to mention, based on everything I've heard from 1st Sgt and others, with all the rain they've gotten, it was definitely a good couple of weeks to be off the trail. 
I've kept in contact with 1st Sgt and hope to join him again in about a week. I suspect he'll be close to Shenandoah National Park by then. Right now, with packing and unpacking, doing two house closings, setting up new utilities, insurance, licenses, registrations, internet service, etc, etc, etc, the AT feels a million miles away. It almost feels like it was all a dream. I'm really hoping I haven't totally lost my hiker legs by the time I get back out there. 
I also know that this week in Knoxville will really fly by and I won't be ready to go back when it's time. There will be a million things left undone and, after three weeks together, it will be very hard to leave Marguerite again. But I'll worry about that next week. Right now I have a ton of boxes to unpack!","Knoxville, TN

The house in Knoxville is beginning to look like a home. Most of the boxes in the house have been unpacked. We are planning to do some remodeling, so a large number of items will remain in boxes in our garage or in a storage unit until that work is completed. 
With the majority of the unpacking completed, we were able to get out and take care of much of the business associated with moving. We opened new bank accounts, got TN driver's licenses, and TN vehicle registrations. TN is one of several states along the AT that offers an AT vanity plate. I couldn't resist. I had to have one for my Jeep. That new license plate made me way happier than something like that reasonably should have. What can I say - I guess I'm just a big kid. I've waited for years for WV to adopt one, so I finally gave up and moved to a state that offered an AT vanity plate. 
As the house comes together, that small, distant voice of Mt Katahdin gets fractionally louder in my head. 1st Sgt is 250 miles further up the trail than when I left and is beginning to crank out bigger and bigger daily miles. The chunk of trail that I will have to come back and complete in the Fall continues to get larger. Of course, he's right on schedule with where I predicted he'd be; but, I'm still beginning to feel a little more left behind with every adventure he relates in his blog. 
Barring any unforeseen issues with the house, I will probably return to the trail this coming weekend. It looks like Waynesboro, VA will be the most likely rendezvous spot to meet back up with 1st Sgt. The only problem is figuring out how to get there. 
It's about a five and a half hour drive from Knoxville to Waynesboro, which is too long of a round trip for Marguerite to drive in one day. She could break the trip up into two days; however, the problem is that her son Chris will be out of town this coming weekend and we don't know anyone else well enough yet to ask them to watch our menagerie overnight. 
A one way car rental is pretty exorbitant, so I'm thinking of leaving the driving to Greyhound. I can get a bus ticket from Knoxville to Charlottesville, VA for $62. The bus leaves Knoxville at 12:30 AM and arrives in Charlottesville at 8:35 AM. Then, I could grab a shuttle, cab, or Uber for the 28 mile trip to Waynesboro. Just getting back to the trail should be an adventure itself! Once details are finalized with 1st Sgt, I'll update again.","Knoxville, TN

I talked to 1st Sgt on the phone Wednesday and we finalized plans to meet back up. We plan to meet Monday morning at the visitor center at Rockfish Gap. 1st Sgt expects to arrive in Waynesboro, VA, on Sunday and take a Nearo to resupply. On Monday morning, he will catch a shuttle up to Rockfish Gap. 
Meanwhile, I will board a Greyhound bus Monday morning at 12:10 AM in Knoxville. That alone ought to be interesting - Greyhound bus stations always seem to be in the sketchiest part of town. Marguerite is planning to take Gertie, our most protective dog, with her when she drops me off. I also think she plans to slow down just enough for me to roll out of the car as she speeds off, locking the doors enroute. My backpack ought to be sufficient to break my fall. 
I will then ride through the Virginia countryside all night, sleeping with one eye open, arriving in Charlottesville at 8:25 AM refreshed and ready to hike. A nice trail angel named Jeff offered to give me a ride from Charlottesville to Rockfish Gap; however, that was when I planned to arrive on Sunday, so I'm not sure if the new arrival time will work for him (Jeff - please email me directly at rmillerwv@gmail.com. I tried to reply to your post and TrailJournals said the email failed to go). If that doesn't work out, I will grab an Uber or a cab. 
 With all the work we've done putting the house together, I still haven't looked at my pack to determine what I plan to switch out for Summer hiking. Of course, right now, it's pretty much like early Spring in the Southeast, with lows in the 30s and 40s at night. It has also rained. And rained. And rained. I can't say I'm sorry that I've missed out on the recent weather that 1st Sgt and all the other thru hikers have been dealing with lately.
Although I'm excited to get back on the trail, I hate to think about leaving Marguerite again. The house is in pretty good shape; however, we are planning to do some renovations this Summer that she will be stuck dealing with. Luckily, we have a good architect (her son Chris) overseeing the project. Once again, I am very lucky to be married to such a patient and resilient woman.

At the bus station in Knoxville. We got the house in good shape before I left. I went through my pack and removed my winter gear and replaced it with my summer gear today. Marguerite helped me with some equipment repair. 
The drive to the bus station was uneventful. As expected, the bus station was pretty sketchy; however, Marguerite did stop the car. I didn't have to jump out while she sped off. I don't quite blend in with the other passengers in hiking gear and carrying a backpack. I decided to wait until I get back on trail to put on my kilt. I figured it would reduce my chances of getting beat up. 
I'm hopeful my to actually get some sleep on the bus. I expect tomorrow to be a tough enough hike as it is, having been off trail for 3 1/2 weeks. Sleep deprivation will only add to the pain. 
Leaving Marguerite and the new house was pretty tough. At least this time I'm not leaving her with her hand in a cast and needing to sell the house. It will also be strange to be back on the trail. With all the work on packing the old house and setting up the new house, I haven't had time to think much about the trail; however, I'm looking forward to seeing 1st Sgt again and Shenandoah National Park will be pretty cool. I'll let everyone know how the first day back goes.

My day didn't get off to a good start. I was supposed to leave Knoxville at 12:30 AM on a Greyhound bus. The only problem was that at 12:30 AM the bus was sitting in Nashville waiting on a driver. I ended up spending the night sleeping on a bench in the bus station with four other people, only two of which were other passengers. The bus finally arrived at 5:00 AM. 
I ended up buying one of the non-passengers breakfast out of the vending machines. At first, based on the smell, I thought he was a thru hiker. Then I realized he was not carrying hiking poles.  He'd asked me for 20¢, but I had no change. I watched as he asked everyone else to no avail. He then checked all the machines for change. He was obviously hungry and not just scrounging for change. I then noticed that the machines had debit card readers, so I offered to buy him some food. All he wanted was cheese and crackers and pop tarts. I offered to buy him more; but, he said that was enough. 
Unfortunately, the bus didn't pull out until 6:40 AM. What's worse is that they combined the 12:30 AM bus with the 6:30 AM bus. The problem is that the 12:30 bus was an express bus; whereas, the 6:30 bus was a local. Therefore, my 8 hr bus ride became a 9.5 hr bus ride. Bummer. Last year, a 10 hr flight from Germany to Washington DC with my daughter and her one year old twin boys turned into a three day ordeal. So, in comparison, an 8 hr bus trip turning into a 15 hr trip is nothing in comparison. I just feel bad making 1st Sgt lose another day on the trail.
Once we got rolling, the bus ride was actually quite comfortable and the small towns were interesting. We just stopped at too many of them! After many hours and many small towns, we finally arrived in Charlottesville a little after 4 pm. In ten minutes I had my bag, had summoned an Uber car, and was on my way at to Rockfish Gap. 
1st Sgt was waiting at the gap and it was like we'd never missed a beat as we took off walking and talking just like normal. He filled me in on all the trail gossip of who was where on the trail and who had gone home and so forth. It was 7.7 miles to the shelter and after 5 pm when we started walking, so we had to hoof it to get there before dark.
It was amazing how different the woods looked after being gone for over three weeks. The trees had leafed out and the ground cover had filled in. You could no longer look out and see grand vistas. We were hiking in the proverbial ""green tunnel"" you hear so much about. We didn't see any other thru hikers; however, we saw several day hikers. I was a little winded on some of the uphills; but, all in all, I don't think my hiker legs suffered too much during my time off trail. 
We arrived at the shelter just as it was getting dark - hooray for us - and discovered why we hadn't seen any thru hikers on the trail. They were all here! Every flat spot had a tent - about 6 or 7. It wasn't quite dark yet; but, most people were already in bed. One person who was still awake was Ramsey Bolton! How cool - we hadn't seen him since Damascus. 
I was glad I had switched out to my hammock when I was home because there were no good tent sites left. I found appropriately spaced trees and set up my hammock. It was already pretty dark and I hadn't set it up since last Fall; but, luckily I remembered how it all went together. 1st Sgt opted to stay in the shelter since only one other person was in it. 
It's now 10 pm and everyone else is in bed. I am fed, my bear bag is hung, and I am in my hammock with all my clothes on. There is a frost warning for tonight and none of us are carrying winter gear. So, it might prove to be a chilly night, especially since I don't have an underquilt for my hammock. It's great to be back!","Knoxville, TN

I stayed warm in my hammock last night. It didn't get as cold as expected and I wore all my clothes to bed. I slept really well. I am so happy to be back in my hammock. It is much more comfortable than sleeping on the ground. 
We were on the trail by 7:45 this morning. We were planning a 19.1 mile day, so we wanted to get an early start. We'd hoped to see Ramsey Bolton to say goodbye because he was only planning a 13.1 mile day to the next shelter. However, he was still asleep in his tent when we headed out. 
It was a beautiful day for hiking - full sun and highs in the 50s. 1st Sgt led out and set a pretty quick pace. I was follo I got behind, holding on for dear life. It was like hiking behind Lumber Jill into Hot Springs, only the view wasn't as nice. I guess three and a half weeks off the trail was harder on my trail legs than I'd hoped. Not to mention, 1st Sgt spent those 3 1/2 weeks getting stronger. 
By the time we rolled into the Black Rock Mt Hut for lunch 5 hours and 13.1 miles later, I was pretty beat! Taking the pack off, eating lunch, and resting for awhile rejuvenated me and soon we were ready to head out and finish off the last 6 miles to the Loft Mt Campground where we planned to spend the night. I suggested to 1st Sgt that he could go ahead and hike his own pace and I'd meet him at the campground. He poo-pooed  the idea and told me to go ahead and take the lead and we'd hike my pace. 
We made pretty quick work of the last few miles and arrived at the campground a little after 5 pm. We picked out and paid for our site, set up camp, and headed to the camp store to buy dinner. After dinner we each splurged and spent $1.75 for 5.25 minute showers. It felt wonderful. I also took the opportunity to check for ticks. We each had removed ticks from our legs as we hiked today, so I am on high alert for ticks. 
When we returned to our campsite, Ramsey Bolton was there! He'd decided to push on to the campground and had seen our campsite on the way to register for a site so he set up his tent with us. It appears that we will have bad storms mid-week, so the three of us took some time to plan out the next few days to try to find shelters and park facilities to minimize how much we have to set up tents and hammocks in cold rain. It will be nice to have Ramsey with us the next few days. 
In the ""It's a Small World"" category, it turns out that one of the section hikers in the site next to us lives about 10 miles away from our new home in TN. We even talked about him maybe joining me for a portion of my make-up hike in VA in the late summer. How cool is that?
I find I'm a little sore tonight and I may have a small hot spot on my left foot that I will treat with Luekotape before heading out tomorrow; but, all in all, I'm pretty pleased with today's hike. It's great to be back out here.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Today was a banner day on the trail - 1st Sgt and I saw our first black bear! We woke up to overcast skies, a possible harbinger of things to come if you look at the weather forecasts. We headed out at 7:45 AM, leaving Ramsey snoozing in his tent. It was a 2.5 mile hike to the Loft Mountain Wayside, where we planned to have a hot breakfast. The wayside was only about a mile from us if you cut through the campground; but, the AT did a big loop around the campground. And you know us and the white blazes...
Today we were rewarded for our devotion to the white blazes. As we hiked around the campground, we heard a rustling in the bushes about 25 yards to our left. We both looked over in time to see a young bear looking back at us. He only stood there for a second before plunging into the brush, so we unfortunately were not able to get a picture. How cool! The rest of the morning we were on high alert watching for more bears. It's amazing how much a squirrel can sound like a bear. 
The wayside was located on Skyline Drive, which was 0.6 miles down a steep trail from the AT. Luckily, the breakfast was worth the steep hike back up to the AT - eggs, sausage, hash browns, toast, hot tea, and a blackberry milkshake. Of course, since it was in the park, it was expensive. We didn't get back on trail until 10:30; but, that was OK because we were doing a relatively short hike of 15.3 miles.
As we hiked, the skies cleared and it turned out to be a pleasant day. There was quite a bit of up and down; but, the treadway was nice and smooth. 1st Sgt led out most of the day. He can still outpace me on the uphills; but, I'm holding my own on the downhills and flats. I also found that my feet didn't hurt as much today. I think I'm beginning to get my hiker legs back and should be up to speed by the time we leave Shenandoah National Park. 
If you haven't visited this park, I highly recommend it. Skyline Drive and the AT criss-cross one another along the ridgeline for 101 miles. We probably crossed Skyline Drive six times today. The views all along the way are incredible. There are several places along the way to stop for food and other essentials like blackberry shakes. Not cheap, but way convenient. 
The forest is a riot of colors right now. Red, yellow, blue, purple, and orange flowers everywhere. I wish I knew more about flowers so I could identify them. The forest is also alive with songbirds of every variety. Once again, I wish I could identify more of them. Also, the trees have all leafed out since I left the trail in early April. 
The big news on the trail is potential bad weather over the next few days. It's supposed to move in tonight and rain 1-2 inches over the next couple of days. We are staying in a shelter tonight to keep our equipment dry. Tomorrow, 1st Sgt, Ramsey, and I are planning a 20 mile day to Big Meadows Lodge, where Marguerite has reserved a room for us. Hopefully, the forecasts are wrong...","Loft Mt Campground

Today was an absolutely miserable day to be in the woods; but, I had a great hike! We had rain off and on all night. Luckily, we were in the shelter, so we stayed dry. I didn't sleep as well as I would've in my hammock, but I wasn't packing up wet gear this morning. So, it all balanced out. 
I awoke at 5:40 and saw that 1st Sgt was already up, so I got up and started packing. We were on the trail by 6:35 AM, our earliest start ever, hoping to take advantage of a break in the weather to cover as many miles as possible before the rain returned. It wasn't until we had been hiking for awhile that 1st Sgt told me that he was just getting up to use the bathroom and intending to lay back down and sleep more when he saw me start packing, so he started packing up too. Oops!
Although the woods were wet and dripping, it was pleasant walking. 1st Sgt, who has contracted a terrible case of bear fever, just knew that early morning was the best time to see another bear. Unfortunately, no bears this morning. 
We made it 3.7 miles before the rain pummeled us. We were soaked to the skin in a matter of minutes. There's something liberating about being absolutely soaked. Since you can't get any wetter, you don't have to worry about jumping from rock to rock, trying to keep your feet dry. You can just walk right down the middle of the raging torrent where the trail used to be. Your feet aren't going to get any wetter! There was also no reason to worry about rain gear since we were already soaked. 
Of course, along with the rain came fog. Soon we could only see a few feet in any direction. My view was further diminished by the fact that, as always happens on rainy days, my glasses fogged up. If you are planning to hike the AT, wear glasses, and have expendable cash, I would recommend LASIK surgery before starting the hike!
In the rain and fog, it is easy to sort of allow your world to diminish and become inwardly focused and brooding. That's the nice thing about hiking with someone else. There's someone to converse with and keep you from focusing on how miserable it is. And our conversations have evolved! We've gone from Ginger vs Marianne to such esoteric subjects as ""do you like Spam better fried or straight from the package?""
After several hours of hiking through intermittent showers, we arrived at Lewis Mt Campground, where we planned to stop at the camp store for lunch. The only problem was that the fog was so thick we couldn't find the store! We did eventually stumble upon the camp host trailer, where we knocked on the door and got directions to the store. After warming up in the store and eating lunch, we headed out for the last 8 miles of our adventure. The temperature was steadily dropping, so we donned our rain jackets for warmth. 
I was actually surprised at the number of hikers we encountered on the trail on such a cold, wet, miserable day. One such encounter was particularly cool. We were passing two southbound hikers when one stopped and said, ""Hey - are you Beaker?"" He then went on to say, ""Wow. You've really cleaned up. And you've changed your outfit. By the way, how was the move to TN?""
It turns out that Sugarfoot had been following me regularly on TrailJoirnals until he started his own hike. We stood and talked to him and his hiking partner Carry Less for several minutes. How cool was that!? 
After several more miles and showers, we finally arrived at Big Meadows Lodge. Once again, we had to ask directions to find the lodge because the fog was so thick. We eventually got checked in and were joined in short order by Ramsey Bolton. We had a slight dilemma when we first arrived and wanted to leave a key at the front desk for Ramsey - we didn't know his real name! I inquired whether either of the women working the desk were Game of Throne fans. Luckily, since they didn't know Ramsey Bolton was the name of a fictional character, they didn't bat an eye when I said I wanted to leave a key for Ramsey Bolton. 
After cleaning up, the three of us went to dinner in the lodge restaurant and washed our clothes at the laundromat. We are now back in our room, which is old, rustic (i.e., no TV, phone, or internet), and obscenely overpriced. But it is cold and very wet outside, and we are warm and dry inside. So, we are very happy. 
BTW, Ron and Sue M, you should be happy. I finally broke the 20 mile barrier!","Hightop Hut, VA

Another rainy day. 1st Sgt, Ramsey, and I awoke around 6:30 AM in a nice warm, dry room at the Big Meadows Lodge, ate a hot breakfast in the dining room, and were on the trail by 8:30 AM. 
The morning was overcast, brisk, and foggy, but no rain. We had an 18.8 mile day planned, with lunch at the Skyland Lodge restaurant (I love hiking SNP - food everywhere!). Ramsey was still fiddling with his pack after breakfast and told us to go on. I think he prefers hiking alone. The trail was pretty flat and the rain was holding off, so we made good time. I feel like I'm pretty much back up to speed at this point. Yay!
We passed through a section of very pretty waterfalls cascading down the rock faces next to the trail. If we hadn't have had all the rain yesterday I don't think many of these would have been flowing much. Of course, there were no views to be had. We passed many overlooks that were walls of pure white clouds. It's like the Smokies all over again, substituting rain for snow. 
At one point in the hike, we saw contraptions that looked like the styrofoam trays from ground hamburger packages strung together in a stack of six or so, hanging from a pole about four feet in the air. We speculated that they were a trap of some sort, maybe gypsy moths or pine borers or maybe even aliens. We never decided what they were and moved on. 
After hiking eight miles, we reached the blue blazed trail to Skyland Lodge. Once again, the fog was so thick that we couldn't even see the lodge; however, we were at least able to find it this time without asking for directions. 
It was a little before noon, so we had to wait a few minutes for the restaurant to open for lunch, which gave Ramsey time to arrive and join us. We all had nice hot lunches and prepared to head back out. Ramsey had checked the weather forecast on his phone and it looked like rain would start any minute. 
It was noticeably cooler when we emerged from the building, so we donned our rain jackets for warmth and headed out. As predicted, it was t long before it began to sprinkle. We passed an older man taking a break along the trail and he asked, ""So, does hiking in a skirt work?"" Without batting an eye, I said, ""Sure! It got me him!"" and pointed to 1st Sgt. It took them both just a second...
We continued to hike and eventually came upon a crew of US Geological Survey employees carrying what appeared to be stacks of six or so styrofoam trays like what comes in ground hamburger packages (see picture). Aha! Now we would have an answer to our mystery! It turns out that they are rainfall and humidity monitors that they are placing as part of a study of salamander habitat in Shenandoah National Park. We stood and talked to the crew for probably twenty minutes. Luckily, we both find that talking to people we meet along the way is one of our he most interesting aspects of the hike. 
As we continued to hike, it settled into a steady rain. At one point, we passed a couple hiking down the mountain and, of course, stopped to talk. It turns out that they are Flip Floppers that just started at Rockfish Gap a few days ago. They did not appear to be enjoying the rain. When we told them our trail names, they both lit up. It turns out they had been reading our trail journal pages before starting their hike. Cool!
We finally arrived at the shelter wet, but not soaked to the bone (more specifically, not soak to the undershorts - that s when the problems start). We are now tucked in our sleeping bags in dry clothes in the shelter. We are sharing it with father and son section hikers from PA. The Flip Floppers opted to tent. 
The rain is still steadily falling; however, it's supposed to pass through by 9 AM and then be nice for the next 8 days! Yay! Tomorrow is a 22.4 mile day, so we plan to be up early. We'll have second breakfast at the Elkwallow Wayside late morning, pass out of the park in the afternoon, and be at a hostel tomorrow evening where we can dry out, resupply, and plan out our last few days in Virginia.","Big Meadows Lodge, VA

1st Sgt, Ramsey, and I shared the shelter with two Southbound section hikers last night. It was pouring the rain and there were no good hammock sites, so I opted to sleep in the shelter rather than hammock. Whenever I sleep in a shelter, I wear earplugs to block out the sounds of other hikers snoring. I had gotten my earplugs out of my toiletries bag before placing it in the bear bag with my food (it contains toothpaste, etc, so it gets bearbagged also). 
By the time I finished my blog, all the other shelter dwellers were asleep. Two of the dwellers turned out to be prodigious snorers, so I decided to put in my earplugs before I went to sleep. Unfortunately, when I reached in my pocket for my earplugs, I discovered that the shape of my dental floss container is remarkably similar to that of my earplugs case. Unfortunately, the shape of dental floss is nothing like that of earplugs. To make matters worse, the prodigious snorers appeared to be coordinating their efforts. When one stopped snoring, the other took up the task with great gusto. It turned out to be a long night. 
1st Sgt and I awoke around 5:30 AM to a gray, blustery, dripping world. We packed up, ate breakfast, and were on the trail by 6:30 AM. Our destination was the Elkwallow Wayside, eight miles distant, where we planned to have second breakfast. The miles passed quickly and, by 9:15 AM, we were tucking into our hot breakfasts. We did make one small wrong turn on the way to the wayside that made us go approximately 0.6 miles out of our way and required us to crawl under a blown down tree (twice!). Oops. 
After second breakfast, we returned to the trail and were soon joined by another thru hiker whose trailname was Norm (inspired by the Cheers character). He started his thru hike on 3/31 (over a month after us!) and was averaging 25+ miles a day, including stops. He must have been feeling lonely today because he slowed down to hike with us for most of the day. He was a nice guy and it was fun to add a third voice to our conversation. 
While we were stopped along the Skyline Drive eating our lunch, several members of a local hiking club came along. They stopped to talk and spent the next 30 minutes asking us questions about thru hiking. We were the first thru hikers any of them had met and they had lots of questions. 
After a few more miles of blustery, damp hiking we finally arrived at the Terrapin Station Hostel. It is in the basement of a home owned by a 1995 thru hiker named Mike. With a name like Terrapin Station, it was a pretty easy leap of logic to determine that Mike is a Deadhead (he saw the Grateful Dead in concert 130 times!). 
After showering and washing our damp, smelly clothes, Mike shuttled me, 1st Sgt, Ramsey, and another thru hiker named Bluebell to the local grocery store for resupply. Afterwards, we hung out in the hostel gabbing until bedtime. 
Today was my longest day on trail - 22.7 trail miles. With the additional miles we walked on blue blaze trails (not to mention taking a wrong turn), we actually walked closer to 25 miles. Tomorrow, 1st Sgt and I will continue heading north while Ramsey takes a zero day to rest a sore ankle. We expect to be in Harpers Ferry next Tuesday. We are also expected to have good weather for the foreseeable future. Yay.","Pass Mountain Hut

I observed a first on the trail today. As you can probably guess, 1st Sgt is a fairly level guy. Well, I watched him have a meltdown today, including a few cuss words and a possible threat of violence. It was quite hilarious. 
Fair skies have finally returned to the AT. We awoke to full sunshine coming in the windows of the hostel. 1st Sgt and I packed up and headed out by 7:30 AM. Ramsey is taking a zero day to rest his ankle and Bluebell was slow packing up, so we said our goodbyes and headed out. As usual for a town day, an uphill climb with a heavy pack and a stomach full of town food started the day. 
We cruised along under sunny skies enjoying the dry weather. Unfortunately, the trail is still pretty mucky, with running water in many places. So, our feet still ended up pretty wet. 
We saw a lot of day hikers out today. It appeared to be mostly families, so I suspect there were a number of Mother's Day hikes. We'd see smiling Moms, huffing and puffing Dads, and bored kids. I imagine the conversation went something like ""what I'd really like for Mother's Day is for all of us to go on a family hike"". Followed by ""aw Mom! Can't we just take you to IHOP for breakfast?""
At one point, we saw AT trail volunteer Tom out cutting weeds along the side of the trail. We thanked him profusely for his service to the trail. It is the huge number of hours of work by countless volunteers that provide such a great trail for us to hike on. We always thank the volunteers when we meet them. 
While we were talking to Tom another hiker came by with his family and asked us if we planned to stop for ice cream when we hit Va Rt 650. He told us the ice cream store was next to the barbecue place right where the trail crossed the road. That, of course got our attention. We had planned to eat lunch when we reached to Jim & Molly Denton shelter in another two miles; however, the prospect of barbecue and ice cream was well worth delaying lunch another 3 miles until we reached the road. We thanked him for the information and headed on our way. 
We still dropped in at the Jim & Molly Denton shelter because we'd heard so much about it. It is one of the nicest shelters on the trail, with a front porch with lounge chairs, horseshoe pit, picnic pavilion, and even a solar shower. It was too bad we hit the shelter in the middle of the day. It would've been a great place to spend the night. After checking out all the amenities and scanning the shelter register to figure out where all our friends are, we headed on our way with visions of pulled pork dancing in our heads. 
After hiking through miles of mud and muck and seeing several more families out hiking for Mother's Day, we arrived at the roadside. As we scanned the buildings that looked like houses, trying to decide which was the barbecue place and which was the ice cream place, I began to get a sick feeling in the pit of my empty and withered stomach. 
I looked at the AWOL guide and discovered that the restaurant was 1.2 miles to the west. For someone driving a car, 1.2 miles is ""right on the trail"". For someone walking, it's a half hour walk. This is the point that 1st Sgt melted down. It was a pretty impressive tirade. At first, I was as upset as him; but, I began to get tickled watching him and was soon laughing. We consoled ourselves with the fact that on Mother's Day the restaurant would've been too crowded to get service anyway. 
We ended up finding a picnic table right next to the trail and had a nice lunch eating the food we had carried, thus eliminating some weight from our packs. By the time we finished lunch, 1st Sgt had quit fuming and I was only occasionally chuckling. Still, we both agreed that a chocolate milkshake really would've hit the spot. 
After lunch, we settled into a long climb, followed by several more miles of muddy trail and hiking families. A warm, sunny afternoon and a full belly left me wanting a nap. At one point we came across a group of birders out for their annual Mother's Day birding hike. We entertained them for about 20 minutes with tales of thru hiking. We are developing quite the routine, complete with jokes and fun trail facts. I think talking with the birders improved both our moods and bolstered our spirits for the remainder of the hike. 
We arrived at the shelter around 5 pm. This spot actually has two shelters - an old, small shelter named Dick's Dome and a brand spanking new shelter called Whiskey Hollow. The old shelter had a couple staying in it and they had spread out, so we headed to the new shelter 50 yards up the hill. 
We are now set up at the new shelter, with me in my hammock and 1st Sgt sharing the shelter with two thru hikers and a section hiker. There is another section hiker tenting nearby. We had never met the thru hikers before; however, Echo and Kricket are both really nice young guys. 
We've noticed that the thru hikers are really thinning out. We are only seeing one or two others at the shelters, where we were seeing sometimes up to 20 other thru hikers at a time. We've also noticed that almost all the thru hikers we are now seeing are young men. All the women and older hikers seem to  have disappeared. We did spend the night with Bluebell at the Terrapin Station Hostel; however, she had just started her Flip Flop thru hike at Rockfish Gap. We also know that Lumber Jill, Winter, Oz, Legs, and Brie are still on the trail; but, they are all several days ahead. In general, though, its mostly young men. I guess attrition is taking its toll. Two more days to Harpers Ferry and the spiritual mid-point of the trail at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters.","Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel

This turned out to be a tougher day of hiking than we initially expected. We awoke to another beautiful morning. By the time I got up, took down my hammock, and packed my bag, 1st Sgt was also up and ready to go. We hit the trail around 7:30. 
The first 11 miles of the trail were pretty easy. We even got to play Frogger running across the four lane US Rt 250. Luckily, there was a median and traffic was light.
Then things got more interesting. We entered the Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster is an 11.5 mile section of trail with steep PUDs (Pointless Ups and Downs). About every mile, you climb up about 600 - 800 ft of steep, rocky trail. Then you descend on steep, rocky trail, rock hop across a stream, and start climbing. Lather, rinse, repeat. 
We spent the last seven miles of our hike in the Roller Coaster. The first couple climbs weren't too bad. By the seventh (and longest, steepest) climb, we were really feeling it in our legs. At least we've had the last several hundred miles to get conditioned. Several of the section hikers we passed were really suffering on the Roller Coaster. It turns out that one of the section hikers we met is following us on TrailJournals. Yay!
Another cool thing that happened today is that 1st Sgt reached the 1000 mile mark. That's a lot of walking! I will cross the 700 mile mark tomorrow and will have 319 miles of Virginia left to hike when I summit Katahdin. I have been very content with my decision to skip ahead and rejoin the hike with 1st Sgt. We hike together really well. Besides, we've heard through the hiker grapevine that norovirus has once again broken out in the bubble further south. I am really happy to stay away from that!
Tonight we are staying at the Bears Den Hostel in Bluemont, VA. The hiker hostel is located in the basement of an old mansion owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. For $30 we got a bunk with pillow and sheets, a shower, laundry, a 12 in pizza, a soda, a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream (which is 1200 calories alone!) and a waffle breakfast. That's a pretty good deal!
Tomorrow we will hike 20 miles into Harpers Ferry, WV where we will visit the Headquarters of the ATC and get our pictures taken for the hiker scrapbook. What's even more exciting is that we will get to have dinner with my son Sam and my soon-to-be daughter in law Caileigh.

This was a banner day on the AT - we had another 20 miler, we checked off another state, we visited the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ, we saw old friends, and I got to see my son and his fiancé. 
1st Sgt and I were the first ones up this morning at the Bears Den Hostel. I find we pretty consistently wake up around 5:30 AM now. We went upstairs and made self-serve pancakes to allow others time to wake up. We then packed up and were on the trail by 6:30 AM. Our goal was to get to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters before they closed at 5:00 pm so 1st Sgt could pick up a resupply package he had sent there. Otherwise, we would be sitting around tomorrow morning waiting for them to open. 
The first four miles of our hike were still in the Rollercoaster and were pretty steep. We also had to play a serious game of Frogger trying to get across rush hour traffic on US Rt 7 without getting smashed. We did get a nice view from a rock outcropping and ended up spending more time there than planned. As a result, we really had to pour it on to get back on schedule. Luckily, the Rollercoaster soon ended and the trail moderated considerably. The treadway was still pretty rocky; but, the ascents and descents were much gentler. 
Looking at the AWOL guide, we found that there was a convenience store on Rt 9 at the 15 mile mark that had a deli. Food is always a good motivator for thru hikers. So, we redoubled our efforts and made it there a few minutes after 1:00 PM. 
After a delicious lunch eaten in front of the convenience store, we hightailed it the rest of the way into Harpers Ferry, stopping only long enough to take pictures at the state line. We arrived at the ATC HQ at 4:18 PM. 
At the ATC HQ they took our pictures in front of the building and added them to the 2017 hiker picture album. I also found out that I am thru hiker number 238 to reach this point from Springer Mt. When we went inside, we found Courtney (now going by the trailname Hoops) and Sitting Bull there! How cool! I hadn't seen them since before I went off trail in early April. It's always fun to run into old friends on the trail. 
We next made our way up the street to the Teahorse Hostel. It's a very nice and clean hostel. While we were getting cleaned up, my son, Sam, and his fiancé, Caileigh, arrived. Since Hoops and Sitting Bull were also with us and we wouldn't all fit into their car, we decided to walk to an Italian restaurant just down the street. In the end, we were joined by two other hikers named Gibby and KJ. It was a very good meal and, to top it off, Sam bought my dinner. Woo hoo! Thanks Sam! After dinner, Sam and Caileigh drove me and Hoops to the grocery store to restock for the next segment of our hike. What a great help that was! Thanks again Sam!
We are now back at the Teahorse. The funny thing is that they do not cater exclusively to hikers. There are as many non-hikers here as there are hikers. I don't think the nonhikers quite know what to think of us. There is a young woman here who is starting her Flip Flop hike in the morning. It's fun to see the mixture or nervousness and excitement and remember that we were all in the same place a few months ago. 
Tomorrow, we cross the Potomac River and head into Maryland. After 40 miles, we will cross the Mason-Dixon Line and officially enter the northern portion of our hike.","Bears Den Hostel, VA

Another great day on the trail. I know I say that a lot; however, it's true. I have had very few bad days on the trail. We woke up around 5:30 AM and got ready to go. The hostel price included a waffle breakfast, so we went into the kitchen to fix ourselves some waffles. The only problem was, although there were waffle makers, there was no waffle mix. 
Luckily, we had cinnamon rolls. The evening before, on our way to dinner, we passed a bakery that sold pepperoni rolls. Pepperoni rolls are a WV food that I've never seen anywhere else. I love pepperoni rolls. 1st Sgt had never heard of pepperoni rolls. So, obviously, we had to buy pepperoni rolls. We ended up buying a half dozen pepperoni rolls to share with our friends. Since she was getting ready to close for the night, lady who owned the bakery was very sweet and threw in five cinnamon rolls for free. They ended up being our breakfast. 
1st Sgt did call the guy managing the hostel to say there were no supplies for making the waffles and got the answering machine. He showed up just as we were leaving. Bummer. 
We got back on the AT and followed it down through downtown Harpers Ferry. Harpers Ferry is one of my favorite towns in WV. It is located at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers and is the site of John Brown's Raid, a failed attempt to seize guns for a slave uprising prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. Most of the historic section of town is owned by the National Park Service. As a result, it has been preserved and is a great place for a history buff.
We ended up lingering in town for awhile and 1st Sgt even found two nearby geocaches. Eventually, we found our way across the bridge over the Potomac River and into Maryland. The trail through WV was only four miles long, so we finished off another state. 
After crossing the river, the AT runs along the C&O Canal Bikepath for a few miles, providing other opportunities to check out cool historical things. If you aren't familiar with the C&O Canal, you should Google it. It had a fascinating history. 
After a couple of miles, we left the bikepath and started climbing out of the valley, stopping to take in the views at Weverton Cliffs. I had received a message on my guest page from trail angel Vickie (aka ""Real Deal"") saying she wanted to meet up with us and bring us lunch. Cool! She had suggested we meet at Gathland State Park around 11:45 AM. Gathland was just a few miles up the trail, so that should have been perfect timing. The only problem was that we had lingered a bit too long looking at cool historical things. 
When we realized we were running late, we had to put it in high gear and move it down the trail. We ended up being a little late; but, she was quite gracious about it. Vickie had brought us Italian subs, cold sodas, ice, homemade brownies, and fruit. What a feast! We asked what we had done to deserve all this and she said that she enjoyed reading people's blogs on TrailJournals and bringing them lunch. I am constantly amazed at how many nice people there are out here on the trail. 
After lunch, we felt quite lazy and were ready to just hang out or maybe take a nap under the cool pavilion, especially since temperatures had risen into the 90s. Unfortunately, we had another seven miles to hike. So, we shouldered our packs and headed out. The afternoon passed slowly; but, we eventually made it into camp. 
We are staying at the Dahlgren Backpackers's Campground. A free facility provided by the state of Maryland for us by backpackers. It had tent pads, a bear pole, and, best of all, toilets and hot showers. Score! Another great day on the trail!","Teahorse Hostel, Harpers Ferry, WV

I fell asleep last night before I could write my blog and slept all night. Luckily, I woke up at 5:00 AM and wrote my blog before anyone else woke up. I was just finishing up when 1st Sgt woke up. We ate breakfast, got packed up, and were on the trail by 6:50 AM. 
It was a pretty tough day on the trail today. 18.8 miles, fairly rocky and hot, muggy weather. We did see some interesting sights. The first thing we came to was the first Washington Monument, completed in 1827. It looks nothing like the obelisk in DC; but, it's pretty cool nonetheless. We also crossed over I-70 on a long pedestrian bridge. 1st Sgt got the truckers to honk. 
We spent most of the day hiking with Gibby, a former thru hiker who is back doing a long section hike. It was just a long afternoon slogging through the heat. I drank a gallon of water during today's hike and sweated it out as fast as I put it in.
The final hill to the shelter just added insult to injury. It was steep and rocky. To top it off, the spring where you get water for this shelter was 0.6 miles away down a hill. So, we all filled up our water bottles on the trail at a spot 0.7 miles before the shelter and lugged the weight of the extra water up the hill. 
This is a very nice shelter. It's new and big. However, mosquitoes are beginning to move in in the evenings. So, I am in my hammock with my bug net zipped. It's an interesting mix of hikers here. There are five NOBOs, including Hoops (Courtney), who arrived after hiking a 26 mile day. There are several Flip Floppers here, still nervous and figuring out how it all works. We've been very encouraging to them and suggesting that they take it easy the first couple of weeks. We also have several section hikers, so it's pretty full here tonight.

This turned out to be a fairly short day - 13.2 miles; but, that's OK. Some days you just have to take it easy. We got up, ate breakfast, and were on trail by 7:30 AM. Gibby had gotten up and headed out earlier. 
We weren't in too much of a hurry because we were meeting my friend and former co-worker, Ahmed Rahman, for breakfast at 10:00 AM at Pen Mar Park, which was 4.7 miles away. Ahmed took a vacation day and drove five hours round-trip just to come and have breakfast with us. How cool is that!?
As we hiked along, we came upon two young thru hikers sitting on a log looking like zombies. We recognized one of them as Calves, whom we'd last seen at Partnership Shelter in Southern Virginia. It seemed awful early in the morning for them to look so worn out. A conversation ensued:""Hey guys! How are you doing?""""We're alive...barely""""You look beat. Where did you start hiking today?""""Virginia""Ahh, now it all made sense - the Four State Challenge. You see, hiking day in and day out tends to get boring. And it appears to affect the younger hikers the most. They haven't had years of mind-numbing jobs to prepare them to be bored every day. So they come up with challenges, such as the Four State Challenge. 
The Four State Challenge involves hiking in four states in 24 hours. You start just south of the WV line in VA, hike through WV and MD, and into PA. 44 miles in 24 hours. These two were just about five miles south of the PA border when we saw them; but, their time was about up. I hope they made it. 
The next challenge happens at the mid-point of the trail in about two days. It's called the Half Gallon Challenge. It involves ice cream, so it's more my speed. You'll hear more about it at a later date. 
Even though the trail was rocky and hard to follow in places, we made it to Pen Mar Park just about the same time as Ahmed. He drove us to town (I noticed he put the windows down. Hmm...) where we had a wonderful breakfast at Dixie's Diner and a nice visit with Ahmed. After breakfast, he returned us to the trail and we continued north. 
About a half mile later, we came to the Mason Dixon Line. This is the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania; but, it is much more than that. It is the demarcation  between the South and the North. We are no longer hiking in the Southern Appalachians. We are now in the Northern Appalachians. Not only that, it is no longer the AppaLATCHians. It is now the AppaLAYSHUNS (it'll always be the AppaLATCHians to me).
Whereas the underlying theme of the Southern Appalachians, with the Georgia Mountains, Smokies, and Roan Highlands, was a rugged beauty; in this section, there is a real sense of history. There are monuments and placards describing Civil War battles everywhere. 
We walk through the woods and come upon stone walls that are hundreds of years old slowly being reclaimed by the forest. They are very poignant. Someone spent hours and hours of back breaking labor building those walls. Not only that - if you put your ear down to one of the stones, close your eyes, and listen intently, just above the sound of your heartbeat you will hear the crackle of muskets, the booming of cannon, the screams of men and horses, and the moans of the dying. I hear that if you come out here on a night when the moon is just a sliver, you can see the forms of the combatants in the mists, locked in eternal strife. 
Luckily, we were hiking in the daylight, with full bellies, and lazy attitudes. We even stopped at one point to soak our tired feet in an ice cold stream. A brief thunder shower, more thunder than shower, helped cool things down. Trail magic, in the form of cold juice boxes over ice, helped even more. 
It was after 4:00 PM when we reached Tumbling Run Shelter. We contemplated hiking another 6.5 miles to the next shelter; however, that also included a 1000 ft climb. We liked the looks of the shelter area, there appeared to be a lot of nice people here, and there was a stray cat living here. The cat tipped the scales  in favor of staying. She is a very sweet cat who is making out like a bandit, with a new group of hikers feeding her and loving on her every night. 
I am now fed, my chores are done and I'm hanging out in my hammock. I can hear the younger hikers talking and laughing by the campfire. We've come into a small bubble of Flip Floppers who started in Harper's Ferry. They are very excited and nervous and still figuring it all out - just like us in February. It's been another good day on the trail. Tomorrow - 20 miles.","Raven Rock Shelter, MD

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565422,"5/20/17, Rodeway Inn, Shippensburg,  PAMiles hiked: 779.5 Miles to go: 1405.3
Conditions were perfect today for an epic hike - temps in the 60s, overcast skies, light breeze, fairly flat elevation profile, rested legs from a short day yesterday, and light packs since we were almost out of food. We rose to the challenge - 29.5 miles! Bam!
We didn't actually start out to hike 29.5 miles - it just sorta happened. We were on the trail by 6:50 AM and planning a 20 mile day to Birch Run Shelter. The day was perfect for hiking, so we made great time. It wasn't long until we'd covered the 10 miles to Caledonia State Park, where we took a break and were able to find a soda machine. While drinking our sodas, I was looking at the Guthooks AT app on my phone and saw that it was 12.3 miles further to Ironmasters Mansion Hostel at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. We had thought it was farther, so we decided to go for it. We called to make reservations, but had to leave a message. 
Pine Grove Furnace State Park has a special place in the hearts of thru hikers. It is located just past the halfway point of the AT. The General store at the park is the site of the Half Gallon Challenge, where a thru hiker eats a half gallon of ice cream to commemorate reaching the halfway point. 
After hiking 15 miles, I checked the app to see how we were progressing and found that it was 14.5 more miles to the hostel. Oops! I had obviously looked at it wrong the first time. We decided to go back to our original plan of 20 miles to Birch Run Shelter. I called the hostel back and actually got a person this time. I told him that we had misinterpreted our mileage and wouldn't make it there tonight after all. He laughed and said that was fine. 
We made really good time hiking and arrived at Birch Run Shelter by 3:00 PM, which was way too early to stop for the day. I told 1st Sgt that conditions were perfect for an epic hike and that we should go for it. He agreed, somewhat hesitantly, so off we went. As we were hiking along, we came upon Trippin, a young female thru hiker we had met yesterday. She hiked with us a for a few miles until she reached the stealth campsite where she planned to spend the night. 
While hiking with Trippin, we reached another milestone - the halfway point of the trail! It's all downhill from here. Woo hoo! 
By the time we reached Tom's Run Shelter, which was 4.7 miles from the end of our hike, our feet were beginning to hurt and we were slowing down. Any thoughts of stopping were soon cast aside, though, when we arrived at the shelter and found it overflowing with weekend hikers and two Boy Scout troops. 
We trudged on and after 12.5 hours of hiking we finally arrived at the hostel. Wait... there's a sign hanging on the step rail. What does it say..? HOSTEL CLOSED FOR SPECIAL EVENT!? Uh oh, now what? 
We walked next door to the General store, where we found Captain, Good Life, and Hoops (AKA Courtney or Brie) hanging out on the porch.  Hoops and Good Life had successfully completed the Half Gallon Challenge and were looking a bit green around the gills. They were also trying to decide where they were going to sleep tonight. The hostel was closed, the campground was full, and the next viable camping spot on the AT was three miles away. 
Cell service was spotty; however, I was able to text Marguerite. She went to work and secured us a room at the Rodeway Inn in Shippensburg (~10 miles west). It only had a two star rating; however, all the other hotels in town were full. Besides, they were willing to allow five adults in one room. Now all we had to do was figure out how to get there. 
Hope and Good Life were able to secure a ride with a local couple. Unfortunately, their 1978 Chevy Nova was too small to take all of us. Fortunately, Captain, 1st Sgt, and I were able to get an Uber to take us to town. In the end, we all made it to the Rodeway Inn. It actually turned out to be an OK room. We were able to cobble together dinner from the gas station next door.
We are all fed and showered and ready for bed. The kids insisted that 1st Sgt and I take the beds and they would sleep on the floor. They said that if we hadn't come along, they would probably have not figured out where to go. We are all safe, warm, and dry for now. Tomorrow, we have to figure out how to get back to the trail, decide if we are up to the Half Gallon Challenge, resupply, and decide how far are hiking tomorrow. I can tell you this - it's not going to be over 20 miles.","

As you can see from our mileage, today was a much lazier day than yesterday. We all woke up and got moving by around 7:30 AM. The room rate included a ""Continental Breakfast""; but, we didn't hold out much hope and figured we'd end up back at the gas station for breakfast. 
We walked through the breakfast area and saw that the continental breakfast consisted of toast. Yep, that was the sum total of the offerings - toast. Dry toast - not even buttered. We didn't even break stride. We kept walking right out the front door and toward the gas station, laughing the whole way. At the gas station we feasted on such delights as microwaved sausage, egg, and cheese biscuits, breakfast burritos, and little chocolate donuts. 
After our scrumptious breakfast we returned to our room and rounded up our stuff. It's amazing how fast five backpacks can explode and cover a room. Once packed, we began ruminating on just how we were going get back to the trail. When you are driving, ten miles isn't so far. Walking is a different story. 
Then something amazing happened! We were sitting with the door to our room open to the parking lot (five thru hikers and their packs don't smell so good) when this guy comes walking up and says, ""You're Beaker, right?""
It was an incredible trail angel named Iceman. It turns out that Iceman section-hiked the entire trail over a seven year period and now enjoys helping other hikers with their hikes as a way to stay connected to the trail. He had read my TrailJournals blog and knew that we needed a ride back to the trail. 
He had tried to post a message to my guest page; but, the ""new and improved"" TrailJournals has a bug that prevents people with Apple products from posting. So, like any reasonable person, he got in his car early on a Sunday morning and drove an hour to Shippensburg to find us. He had enquired at the front desk about our room number; but, they wouldn't give it to him. So, he drove around the building looking for us. Luckily, due to hiker stench, he was able to see us sitting in our room with the open door. 
Oh yeah - and he brought donuts. Premium donuts. Major score! I am continually amazed at the people out here who are willing to help us thru hikers. I am seeing amazing views, wild animals, and historical sights on this trek; but, it's the people like Iceman and Real Deal who make this such a wonderful trip. Thanks Iceman - you were a real bright spot in our day!
We crammed five hikers and their packs into Iceman's car and headed back to the Pine Grove Furnace General Store. We arrived just as Sitting Bull, who had zeroed in Harper's Ferry due to shin splints, came walking up. 1st Sgt and I opted out of the Half Gallon Challenge, settling on just a bowl of ice cream. Sitting Bull and Captain rose to the challenge, though, and promptly demolished a half gallon of ice cream apiece. 
After watching them eat their ice cream, touring the AT Museum located next door, and eating lunch, we didn't get back on the trail until 1:00 PM. We quickly realized that our feet were still pretty tender from yesterday's marathon hike. So, we decided to check out the next shelter and possibly make it a short day. 
The next shelter turned out to be a nice shelter with individual bunks. There were a mother and daughter already there who were doing a Flip Flop hike. We started talking to them and soon our NOBO friend Ringer arrived (you may recall that Ringer is the woman who found 1st Sgt's wallet when he dropped it in NC). Pretty soon, we decided we were done hiking for the day. 
It has been a pleasant evening. We all decided to stay in the shelter tonight since there is a chance of rain. No one wants to pack up a wet tent or hammock if they don't have to. Tomorrow, it's on to Boiling Springs!","Rodeway Inn, Shippensburg, PA

1st Sgt and I were up and on the trail by 6:50 AM. We had a 1.5 mile hike to the Green Mountain General Store and Deli, where we had a yummy, hot breakfast. When we arrived, Cheap Sunglasses and Rabbit were enjoying coffee on the picnic table out front and Ringer soon arrived to join us. It was a lovely hiker trash picnic!  As we were finishing our breakfast, it started to rain. Luckily, it was only a light rain; however, it continued on and off throughout the day. 
We had a fairly short 12 mile day into Boiling Springs, where we planned to spend the night in a hostel. The problem is that the AT passes through farm fields for the next 14 miles north of Boiling Springs, with no opportunities to camp and limited water supply. Therefore, we had the option of a 12 mile day or a 26 mile day. We chose option number one. 
Although we haven't reached the big rocks for which the AT in ""Rocksylvania"" is famous, the trail has definitely gotten rockier as we work our way north. The problem is that our light weight trail runners aren't up to the task (I've already worn through the toes of my shoes and my socks are sticking out). As a result, our feet are pretty bruised and sore. So, 12 miles definitely seemed the better choice. 
1st Sgt's wife is flying in for the Memorial Day weekend and they are driving to Asheville, NC, for an event 1st Sgt wishes to attend. I am hitching a ride to Johnson City, TN, where Marguerite will pick me up and take me to Knoxville for the weekend. At that time, we both plan to get sturdier shoes for the upcoming rocks. 
The trail into Boiling Springs generally wasn't too bad. There were some ups and downs and some rocks to deal with; but, pretty much a typical day on the trail. We did pass through one section that the map referred to as a rock maze. It wasn't truly a maze; but, it did require a bit of boulder scrambling. It was actually pretty fun.
At one point, we heard rustling in the brush to our right. Was it a bear!? We decided we'd better check it out. We walked to the edge of the drop off and looked down, hoping to see our second bear. Instead we saw a man about twenty feet below us, raking the leaves on the forest floor with a large bamboo leaf rake. When he heard us, he stopped raking and stood looking at us. 1st Sgt said, ""We thought you might be a bear. Is everything alright?""  The man looked at us and said, ""Yes. I'm just looking for something.""  We looked at him. He looked at us. It was as obvious that no more information was forthcoming, so we shrugged our shoulders and continued hiking north. 
As we approached Boiling Springs, the trail ran between fields of corn and barley for several miles. We walked around the fields in the open, making several 90 degree turns. I assume that's what all of tomorrow's hike is going to look like. Hopefully, it is overcast tomorrow. 
The town of Boiling Springs is a quaint town with a shallow pond in the middle of town that was constructed in the 18th Century. We arrived in town around 2:00 PM and were not being picked up by the hostel until 4:25 PM, so we got some lunch at a wonderful Italian restaurant and bought a few needed supplies. 
At 4:25 PM, Lisa fRom Buck Off Hostel picked us up. The hostel is located in a shed beside their home. It has bunks for five and offers showers and laundry. Nothing fancy, but all the essentials. 1st Sgt and I are here with Ringer, a woman named Ghostwalker, and three other female hikers. It is d finitely one of the more unusual hostels we've stayed at.

This was a great day to see a bunch of old friends. We were up, packed, and ready to go by the time Lisa, the hostel owner, came out to get us for the ride back into town. She drove us by the ATC regional office, where we dropped our packs, and then ndropped me, 1st Sgt, and Ringer at the grocery store for resupply. We then walked the mile back to the ATC office, stopping by a diner for breakfast. 
In short order, we stowed our supplies, shouldered our packs, and headed out. Today's hike was probably the flattest hike we will see on the entire trail. We spent the day hiking in the Cumberland Valley. The theme for the day was ""pastoral"". We spent the entire day skirting wheat and corn fields, crossing fence stiles, and passing farmlands. 
There is still a real sense of history in the area, as we pass old stone farmhouses. We even passed a small family cemetery, where the latest date I saw on a headstone was 1889. 
The hike went very fast, even after we took time in Carlisle to visit the Middlesex Diner for lunch. Soon, we were leaving the Cumberland Valley behind and climbing a steep rocky path to the shelter. The spring at the shelter is unreliable, so we loaded up with extra water at a spring about a mile before the shelter and lugged the extra weight up a fairly steep rocky trail. 
The shelter is pretty busy tonight. There are several Flip Floppers who are now about 100 miles into their hikes. You can see the confidence and comfort levels growing in them all. We also are staying with Ringer, Cheap Sunglasses, and Rabbit, whom we've been seeing quite a bit in the past few days. We also ran into Gibby again, who we thought was miles ahead of us. 
Best of all, though, was the arrival of Darwin & Company. They've all just returned from Trail Days and put in a 26 mile day. I haven't seen any of them since Roan Mountain. I was so excited to see Lumber Jill, Strider, Oz, Winter, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes, Darwin, and Legs again. The best part is that they were genuinely glad to see me again, even though they were all amazed with my short hair and trimmed beard. Unfortunately, with me and 1st Sgt going off-trail for the weekend, they will quickly pull ahead of us again; but, it was great to see them even for one night.

We had rain overnight - just enough to make my tarp wet, but not enough to get the rest of my equipment wet. By morning, the sun was out and it was a good morning for hiking. We had breakfast with Darwin & Company and headed out while they were still packing up. No worries, though, we knew they would all pass us on the trail. 
Shortly after leaving the shelter, we came upon The Machine sleeping beside the trail. He had missed the trail for the shelter in the dark last night. Once again, I hadn't seen him since TN, so it was great to see him again. After visiting a few minutes, we moved on. 
Good Life, an 18 year old guy from Asheville who's been hiking around us the past few days (he was with us at the motel in Shippensburg), caught up with us and hiked with us the rest of the way into Duncannon. 
At one point as we climbed up to the top of the ridge, we came upon a group of 7 or 8 middle aged women who get together every year to day-hike portions of the AT.  We have seen them 5 or 6 times over the past week. They have taken to calling me ""Kiltman"". They asked us to take their group picture. In return, they took a picture of the three of us. Good Life says that, as we passed, they were surreptitiously taking pictures of my kilt. Hey - when you got it, you got it!
We eventually caught up with Ringer, who had left camp ahead of us this morning and she joined us. Pretty soon, Darwin passed us. Then, one by one, the rest of the Company began passing by. Everything was right with the world - just like old times. We didn't care. We were enjoying the hike, with Good Life and me belting out tunes from Jesus Christ Superstar at the tops of our lungs, while 1st Sgt and Ringer followed behind. I think Good Life was both surprised that I knew all the lyrics and that I could carry a tune. Once again, when you got it, you got it!
As we hiked, the trail became rockier and rockier. And our feet became hurtier and hurtier. It's definitely time to replace these trail runners with sturdier shoes. I have already worn holes through the toeboxes on each shoe and the thin soles have left my feet bruised and sore. 
We eventually stumbled over the rocks and hobbled into town. Lumber Jill, Oz, and the Machine caught up to us just as we reached town. So, a parade of seven hikers made its way to Main Street and the Doyle Hotel. Ah, the Doyle Hotel. What can you say about the Doyle?
The Doyle Hotel is another AT icon. It was built in the early 1900s and has received no maintenance or cleaning since. It is, without a doubt, the rattiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It also has a bar on the first floor that makes great burgers and other assorted bar food.  We all gathered in the bar at the Doyle and had lunch. 
1st Sgt and I are getting off trail this weekend to visit our wives. His wife is flying in and meeting up with us to drive to Asheville. They will drop me off with Marguerite in Kingsport, TN, to spend the weekend in Knoxville. As a result, we've decided to stay at the Doyle to facilitate the process. 
Our friends were disappointed to hear that we were not hiking out with them. They had hoped we would have a few more days together. One by one, as they finished up lunch and headed out, we said our goodbyes and wished them safe travels. I was particularly sad to see Lumber Jill leave. Except for my hiking buddy 1st Sgt, she is my favorite thru hiker on the trail. 
After they headed out, we spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up and lounging around. Good Life stayed in town to take care of some college registration business and is sharing our room. Gibby also stayed in town and is across the hall. He will be gone by the time we get up in the morning. Ringer headed out this afternoon and will spend the evening with the gang on the trail. Brie, Sitting Bull, and Captain are somewhere ahead of us. We feel a little left behind; but, that's OK because tomorrow we get to see our wives! Yay!","Darlington Shelter, PA

We survived our night in the Doyle Hotel. I checked for bed bugs before going to bed last night and didn't see anything; but, I still chose to use my ground cloth and down quilt rather than sleep on the sheets. Although this appeared to be the perfect haunted hotel, no rattling chains or moaning, ethereal, floating bodies - just snoring. It also poured the rain all night - a good night to be inside. 
I awoke around 5:30 AM and went to the bathroom down the hall (only one per floor). On my way back, I passed Gibby's room. He was up, had the door open, and was packing up. He invited us to go to breakfast with him. When I went to get my shoes, 1st Sgt was waking up. So, he got up and joined us. We left Good Life sleeping on the floor. 
We went across the street to the diner and had breakfast. Gibby had pancakes. They were huge! He couldn't finish two of them. Our server told us that they had a pancake challenge. Seven was the most ever eaten. 
After breakfast, Gibby headed out for the trail and we went back to our room to pack. We told Good Life about the challenge when he woke up. He immediately headed to the diner to take it on. When we finished packing, we headed over to see how he was doing. 
The challenge absolutely crushed him. Four and a half pancakes and he was done. The diner owner kept warning him not to blow chunks on her floor. He managed to make it out of the diner without getting sick; but, he was looking awfully green around the gills. 
He had a couple more hours until 1st Sgt's wife arrived. So, we walked down to the Old Sled Works. It was as a factory that made Liberty runner sleds until it closed in 1990. It has been repurposed into a huge consignment shop. We walked around for a couple of hours looking at cool stuff and a bunch of junk; but, we didn't find anything we couldn't live without. 
Eventually, we made our way back down the street to the Doyle, where Christine was meeting us. In short order, she arrived and we jumped in the car and headed down I-81 to Kingsport, TN. I-81 roughly parallels the AT. The long car ride really drove home just how far we've already come - and we are only half way!
Marguerite met us at Kingsport, TN, and we came back home. The dogs were all happy to see me (as was Marguerite). It'll be nice to be home for a couple of days. With rested feet and sturdier shoes, we will be ready to attack the rocks of Rocksylvania next week.","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA

I have been a bit remiss in writing my blog this weekend. I had an immensely enjoyable time at home with Marguerite and the dogs and just never found time to write. We didn't do anything out of the ordinary. We just spent an enjoyable weekend at home. 
I was happy to find that I still liked our little house this weekend as much as I did when I left a month ago. It had been a whirlwind moving in and I had left before I really had time to get used to being in our new home. It will be even nicer once the planned renovations are completed. 
I had a couple ""honey-do"" projects to complete that I hadn't gotten done before I left last time. That meant several trips to Lowe's. And then several more to return things and buy new things. After the requisite number of Lowe's trips to satisfy the Home Improvement Gods, I successfully completed my projects. 
I also managed to find time to have breakfast with my old hiking buddy Blood Mountain. He was in town for a few days resting his battered feet. Marguerite and I met him at Trio Cafe on Market Square in downtown Knoxville. Afterward, we did some shopping at Mast General Store. Since I was once again remiss in not getting a picture of Blood Mountain at breakfast, I have included a picture of him being chased by a dinosaur. 
The rest of the weekend absolutely flew by, filled with such chores as resupplying for the next four days (heavy pack, ugh!), replacing my worn out trail runners with sturdier Keen hikers, and re-evaluating everything in my pack to try to eliminate a few more ounces of weight. 
We had a violent storm pass through Knoxville yesterday evening, knocking out the power. I was happy to be inside, out of the weather. At about 3:30 AM, the power was restored and we quickly discovered which lights had been left on throughout the house. 
Before long, it was time for Marguerite to return me to Kingsport to meet up with 1st Sgt and Christine. It was a bit of a melancholy ride. I'm excited to tackle the rest of the trail; however, I probably won't see Marguerite again until August. Bleah!  
The ride to Carlisle was uneventful. We had dinner at the Middlesex Diner, where we had lunch when we passed through last week. Tomorrow, we will return to the Doyle in Duncannon and continue our inexorable march toward Katahdin.","Knoxville, TN

I awoke in my motel room in Carlisle, PA, to pouring rain. Yuck. 1st Sgt, his wife Christine, and I decided to forego the continental breakfast in the motel and go to Waffle House and wait out the rain. 
We timed it just right, so by the time we finished breakfast and drove back to the Doyle Hotel the rain had passed. 1st Sgt and I shouldered our packs and headed out hiking, while Christine headed for the airport for her flight back to Texas. 
It was a typical town departure day - full bellies, heavy packs, and, after walking through town and across the river, a long rocky climb to the ridge. We both quickly decided that the sturdier Keen boots were much better on our feet than our trail runners. 
The rain had passed; however, the woods were dripping and the humidity was around 90%. So, of course, my glasses fogged. Bummer. It was also a very short time until our crisp, clean clothes were drenched with sweat. So much for clean laundry. 
The trail was fairly rocky; however, once we gained the ridge, it was pretty smooth sailing. So, we made pretty good time and the morning passed quickly.  We saw several people out hiking and, of course, stopped to talk to all of them. 
As we crossed the pedestrian bridge over PA   225, we saw a sign that makes any thru hiker's heart flutter: ""Trail Magic Today!""  It went on to say that all thru hikers were invited to a nearby cabin for a Memorial Day picnic. It turns out that the cabin is owned by four brothers in their 80s. They have been hosting a Memorial Day picnic for their families for the past 22 years and always invite thru hikers. 
What a great picnic it was, too! Burgers, dogs, various side salads, beans, sandwich fixings, sodas, beer, and wine. And desserts! Lots of desserts! And everyone was so welcoming! Of course, we stayed too long and ate too much; but, we finally hit the trail again around 2:00 pm. 
By the time we reached the next shelter it was 4:00 pm. The problem was, with our late start and impromptu picnic, we'd only covered 11.5 miles. This is a difficult section logistically because the shelters and water sources are scarce on the ridgeline. After debating and studying the map, we decided to press on a few more miles. It feels like we have been creeping through Pennsylvania. 
We finally stopped at a nice camp spot a little after 6:00 pm and 16.1 miles. There's no water here; however, we carried enough with us to get us to a water source in the morning. It's pretty breezy here on the ridge; but, it looks like we shouldn't get any rain until we've had time to pack everything away in the morning. I hate packing up a wet tarp! The weekend at home was nice and I really miss Marguerite; but, it's good to be back out here knocking down the miles.","Carlisle, PA

If I were compiling a list of the ten best hikes I've experienced out here, today's hike would not make the list. Far from it. In fact, I'd have to put this on the 10 worst hikes list. 
We had rain off and on all night and awoke to blowing rain this morning. I had to pack away my tarp soaking wet. It's amazing how much weight wet equipment adds to your pack. We quickly ate a cold breakfast and got walking to warm up. 
It was just nasty weather all day - cold rain, fog, and wind. How do you have both fog and wind, anyway!? When it's like this, the woods become almost oppressive. Everything is wet, so you can't sit down. The trees drip on you and your feet and legs get soaked brushing against weeds along the trail. And, of course, my glasses fog!l At one point, I finally just took them off. It's better to  see fuzzy rocks than not see anything at all. 
Although the majority of the hike was on the ridgeline, we did dip down into a couple of gaps. Then we had steep climbs to get back on the ridgeline.  Wet rocks just added to the fun. The rocks continue to get worse the farther north we hike, which is really beginning to take a toll on our feet. 
We reached the Raush Gap shelter at noon and stopped for lunch. We had already hiked thirteen miles, so we were ready for a break. This shelter was built in 2012 and was pretty nice. Unfortunately, it was way too early to stop for the day. Even more unfortunately, the next shelter was another thirteen miles away. 
The afternoon was more of the same - rain, rocks, and ridgeline. We passed several bright orange streams - leftovers from the bygone coal mining industry in the area. Any of my WV friends are all too familiar with acid mine drainage. 
As the afternoon wore on, we began thinking about a campsite for the night. Everything was soaking wet and muddy. Besides, if we stopped, we would just set up our tent/hammock and jump in to escape the rain. There is nothing more boring than lying in a damp hammock for hours. 
So we kept on hiking. At some point, we made the decision to continue to the shelter. We knew that it was a large double decker shelter, so it shouldn't be full. There would be nothing worse than hiking all that distance to still end up in the rain. 
We had a particularly steep, rocky climb to the ridgeline after crossing under I-81.  Then, just to make sure we were really miserable, the thunder rolled and the rain increased in intensity. We continued to trudge to the shelter, telling each other corny dad jokes (the ones that were sure to get eye-rolls from your kids) to pass the time. The only problem was we both knew the same corny dad jokes. So, we moved on to old commercial jingles (""My bologna has a first name, it's O-S-C-A-R....). 
One cool thing that we did see today was hundreds of little orange salamanders. Or maybe newts. I don't know my lizards very  well. At least someone was enjoying the rainy weather. 
We finally arrived at the shelter around 7:30 pm as the fog was beginning to get pretty thick. It turned out to be a huge shelter with only two people in it. 1st Sgt and I got the loft to ourselves, where we could spread out our wet things to hopefully dry them a little. So, for now, we are safe, warm, and dry, albeit, a little beat up from the tough, wet hike. Unfortunately, they are calling for the same weather tomorrow.","Stealth campsite, PA

I awoke around 6:00 AM to thunder and rain pelting the roof of the shelter. I turned over and went back to sleep. We finally dragged ourselves out of bed a little after 7:00 AM and started packing up, hoping the rain would end. I had everything ready to go before I finally pulled on the dank, musty, damp clothes that have been wet since Monday. Ick. 
Our stalling did pay off, though, because by the time we finally left the shelter at 8:30 AM the rain had stopped and the sun had begun to peak out. As we hiked, the clouds continued to clear. Before long, we were hiking in full sunshine. 
The trail profile for today was incredible. We ran for miles along the ridgeline and our hike was almost completely flat. The trail surface was another matter. The rocks continue to get more numerous. I'm pretty sure that someone is coming out every day and turning the rocks to make sure the pointiest sides stick straight up. 
After a few miles, we came upon a trail angel who was providing trail magic. He thru hiked last year and his trail name was Earnhardt. I don't know what Dale Earnhardt looked like, but 1st Sgt said he could see the resemblance. Earnhardt also had his dog, Clyde Miller, with him. Earnhardt's last name is not Miller - just Clyde's. Anyway, being a former thru hiker, Earnhardt knew what we liked. He had Mt Dew, Gatorade, oranges, apples, chocolate chip cookies, various chips, muffins, Snickers bars, gum, candy, toothpaste, and a charger for us to charge our phones. Wow! We sampled a little of everything and took chips, Mt Dew, and apples for lunch. 
We continued on our way, occasionally struggling over particularly nasty rock outcrops until about nine miles into the hike we came to a beautiful stream at just about lunchtime. Perfect! We put our Mt Dews in the stream to chill, hung out our still sopping tarp and tent to dry, soaked our battered feet in the ice cold water, and basked in the sun. By the time we finally got ready to hike again, it was already 3:00 PM and we still had 9.5 miles to go. 
The afternoon passed quickly. It's amazing the difference a day (and the sun) makes. Whereas the woods felt uninviting and oppressive yesterday, today the woods were warm and lovely. At one point, we came upon Cheap Sunglasses and Rabbit hanging out talking to another hiker named Piccolo. We hadn't seen those guys since just before Duncannon and expected them to be ahead of us after our weekend off the trail. I guess they are in no hurry. It turns out that someone had picked up Piccolo's food bag at the last shelter, so he had no food and was trying to figure out what to do next. 
After visiting awhile, we headed out again. Now it was 5:30 PM and we still had 4.5 miles of rocky trail to cover to reach the shelter. It was going to be another late arrival. We hoofed it over the next few miles and arrived at the shelter around 7:15 PM. There were only two other guys at the shelter - Nico from France who was doing a southbound section hike and a Flip Flopper named Wizard whom we had previously met at Tumbling Run Shelter. 
While we were fixing dinner, Piccolo arrived , hoping that someone had brought his food bag here. No such luck. However, it did turn out that Wizard knew who had his food bag! Another hiker mistakenly thought someone had left their food bag at the shelter and had picked it up. Wizard was able to call the other hiker and make arrangements for Piccolo to retrieve it tomorrow. In the meantime, The Dad's sprung into action and we came up with enough food to tide him over until he gets his food bag back.
I am now resting comfortably in my hammock with tired feet and a full belly. We have a 9 mile hike into Port Clinton tomorrow and a forecast of full sun. Yay!","William Penn Shelter

Today was a funny day of ups and downs - old friends, sore feet, good food, rocks, and a disappointing Cabela's. We were up and on the trail by 7:30 AM. With only 9.3 miles to town, we expected to be there by 11:00 AM. Since the post office where 1st Sgt was picking up his resupply box didn't open until noon, we would have time to grab lunch first. Then we could hitch a ride to the Cabela's in nearby Hamburg to look for a new pair of shoes for me.
When I went home for Memorial Day, I replaced my worn out trail runners with Keen boots, which could better stand up to the Pennsylvania rocks. I had bought these boots before the start of my hike and had broken them in well. Unfortunately, my size 13 feet have gotten bigger with 900 miles of walking, which apparently is not uncommon. As a result, my toes have been cramped, leading to pain and discomfort. I was looking forward the past few days to getting to the Cabela's in Hamburg to replace them. 
The hike into Port Clinton was uneventful (but rocky), except for the last mile. The last mile was straight downhill which, of course, jammed my toes to the front of my boots. Ouch! We arrived in town around 11:00 AM and made our way to the Port Clinton Hotel to have lunch. 
As we were putting down our packs, we heard a squeal and looked up to see Hoops (aka Courtney) running across the street to greet us, with Sitting Bull close behind. They had zeroed in town and were just getting ready to leave. We invited them to join us for lunch. We went into the hotel restaurant and said we'd like a table for four, at which point the waitress apologetically told us that customers were required to shower before they could eat in the dining room, but we were welcome to eat at the bar. We told her that we had indeed showered. She then clarified that last week didn't count. Oops! We, of course, were happy to eat at the bar, where we proceeded to eat the hugest plates of nachos we'd ever seen. 
While sitting at the bar, we started talking to these cute young thru hiking sisters who also apparently hadn't showered this week. As is customary when thru hikers meet, they asked our trail names. I said mine was Beaker and they exclaimed, ""Beaker!? Cool! We've heard all about you!"" My partner in crime then said, ""And I'm 1st Sgt!"" To which they replied, ""1st Sgt. Hmm, that's nice."" As you can imagine, I have had a great time all day recounting that encounter. 1st Sgt doesn't appear to have much of a sense of humor today...
After retrieving 1st Sgt's resupply box, we set out to hitch a ride to Cabela's, which was located 3.4 miles away in Hamburg. Towns near the AT are used to hikers hitching rides, so it's usually not a problem. I had switched from my kilt to pants all the same, figuring small town drivers might not be ready for the kilt. It didn't matter. We didn't get a ride. We walked to Cabela's. Now you have to understand something about thru hikers. We'll gladly walk 2200 miles over all kinds of terrain on the AT; but, we HATE to walk any further in town than is absolutely necessary. 3.4 road miles was an eternity!
We finally arrived at Cabela's, parched and exhausted from our long, lonely sojourn along a busy highway, being passed by so many cars that had so much room for two old, broken down thru hikers. I took the time to put on my not so smelly town shirt and replace my toxic socks with clean ones before entering the store. We made our way through this huge store to the huge footwear section. Guess what? Cabela's has no shoes larger than 13! Argh - I put on my not so smelly shirt and nontoxic socks for nothing!
We went back outside and I changed back into my smelly shirt and toxic socks and called Marguerite, who has been very worried about my feet. She, of course, sprung into action, called REI, ordered size 14 Keen Targhee II mid height boots (brown Shitake color), and arranged to have them shipped to the Wind Gap, PA, post office, where they will be waiting when we arrive Monday. I love that woman!
Our original plan had been to get the resupply and boots and hike out of town about six miles to the first shelter. It was now 4:00 PM and we still had to get the 3.4 miles back to the trail before we could hike the six miles, including a steep 1000 ft climb, to the shelter. While I was working on the shoe issue with Marguerite, 1st Sgt made the executive decision to call the Rock and Sole Hostel and make arrangements to be picked up at Cabela's, fed dinner, shower, have our clothes washed, spend the night, have breakfast, and be dropped back off at the trail in the morning. What a great guy!
We are now at the Rock and Sole with full bellies, clean clothes, clean bodies, and comfy beds. What a great day this turned out to be!","Eagles Nest shelter, PA

After a wonderful breakfast at Rock and Sole Hostel prepared by Jodi, 1st Sgt and I were shuttled back by Craig to the pavilion at Port Clinton to continue our hike. When we arrived, who should we see but our old buddy Ramsey Bolton! It's funny how we continue to cross paths with all our friends. 
Craig suggested we stop by the Port Clinton Barbershop on our way out of town and grab a donut. The barbershop is very hiker friendly and offers free donuts and coffee to all. 1st Sgt decided that it was time to trim up his beard anyway and I'm always ready to eat a donut, so we headed over.
What a cool place! The barbers are father and son. The son is 69 and the father is 90! There were rocking chairs, coffee, tea, donuts, and cookies. And great music! We ended up hanging out and talking to the barbers for quite awhile after Sarge got his beard trimmed by the father. 
Eventually, we shouldered our packs and headed through town and into the woods. The morning sun was shining in our eyes so I went to pull my hat brim down further. That's when I realized that my hat was sitting in the barbershop. Crap! 1st Sgt hung out with the packs while I ran back through town to the barbershop and retrieved my hat. We finally started hiking in earnest around 10:30 AM. Luckily, we only had 15 miles to hike today. 
As usual when leaving town, we climbed. This climb wasn't too bad and eventually we attained the ridge and cruised along. The rocks are still a nuisance because you spend the entire hike looking at your feet. It actually takes quite a bit of concentration and if you let your guard down you might find yourself on the ground. In fact, we heard that our friend Good Life took a bad spill, landed on his chin, and had a possible concussion. Apparently, he's off the trail at least temporarily and maybe for good. 
We had a couple of nice views from overlooks today and the second half of the hike was downhill on wide and fairly smooth trail. So, we were able to move it out and arrived at Eckville Shelter a little after 5:00 PM. 
We were met at the shelter by Hoops and Sitting Bull. As usual, it was nice to see them. Hoops was moving on to the next shelter because she has to go off trail for a few days and is trying to get in some extra miles before she leaves. Sitting Bull decided to stick with us and will hike with us the next few days so he doesn't get too far ahead of Hoops. 
There are about 15 people at the shelter tonight. Most people are tenting; however, 1st Sgt and I were able to snag two of the six bunks built into this shelter. Rain is predicted for the morning, so by sleeping in the shelter we will be able to keep our equipment dry. Once again, this turned out to be a pleasant day on the trail.","Rock and Sole Hostel

We've been hearing since Harper's Ferry, it seems, that the rocks are going to get really bad. First, it was supposed to be right after the Mason-Dixon Line, then Pine Grove Furnace, then Duncannon, then Port Clinton, and so on. Don't get me wrong, the rocks have been quite a nuisance and our feet are really feeling them; however, we keep expecting a rockpocalypse but they continue to be like the day before. Well, I can now tell you where the bad rocks start - just north of the Eckville Shelter. 
I awoke to rain hitting the shelter roof. It's amazing how hard it is to drag yourself out of bed when you know that you have to go hike in the rain. Eventually, 1st Sgt drug himself out of bed, so I did the same. The Weather Channel app was saying that the rain would clear out by 10:00 AM, so least we weren't looking at an all-day rain. 
We were packed and on the trail by 7:30 AM. Shortly after leaving the shelter, we began a rocky 1000 ft climb. We have been hiking around two college-age sisters and their uncle for several days now - Silly Spilly, Pluck, and Shenaniguy. They seem like really nice people (they were the other unshowered people we had seen in the Port Clinton Hotel bar the other day). So, when we caught up to them on the climb, we were happy to stop and visit for a minute. 
As we reached the top of the climb, the rocks turned vicious. We are now hiking on one of two varieties all the time. They are either large rocks that require hand over hand climbing and rock-hopping or small, sharp wobbly rocks that turn your ankles and poke the soles of your feet. As you can imagine, navigating the rocks really slows us down. Of course, wet rocks are even worse. 
Luckily, the rain moved out around 10:00 AM, as promised, and the sun came out. We struggled over the rocks for several miles and finally reached the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter where we stopped for second breakfast. We are in a little bubble right now and shared the shelter with several other hikers. It turns out that all of us had decided to head to the Blue Mountain Summit B&B, about another 4 miles ahead, for lunch. 
We lucked out and the trail smoothed out, allowing us to make good time to the restaurant. It's amazing how food-motivated we've all become - like horses who smell the hay in the barn. By the time we arrived at the restaurant, there were 11 of us ready for a town food lunch. Anytime we don't have to eat Spam, peanut butter, or tuna for lunch is a time to rejoice. Though the service was slow, the food was good. 
After lunch, we only had 6.1 miles to the shelter. The only problem was the rocks got even worse. At one point, we found ourselves on a knife edge, walking on big slabs of rock tilted at a 45 degree angle. That proved pretty tricky. 
After miles of rocks, we finally reached the shelter. It turned out to be an old and small shelter with very limited tenting space. We managed to get five tents and one hammock into the small space and several other people are camping near us along the ridge. We have now eaten and done our evening chores and are all settled into our various tents (and hammock) for the night. Tomorrow, we pass another AT icon - the near-vertical climb out of Palmerton.

Walking under the forest canopy on the ridgeline this morning, listening to the church bells ringing in the valley below, I thought of Emily Dickinson. When she was criticized by a neighbor for not attending Sunday services, she responded with the following poem: 
Some keep the Sabbath going to the Church –I keep it, staying at Home –With a Bobolink for a Chorister –And an Orchard, for a Dome –
Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice –I just wear my Wings –And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church,Our little Sexton – sings.
God preaches, a noted Clergyman –And the sermon is never long,So instead of getting to Heaven, at last –I’m going, all along.
I've always felt the best place to see the glory of God is in the forest. Walking along this ridge I was once again reminded how blessed I am to be able to undertake this journey. 
The weather forecast was calling for rain today, so we got up and got hiking to cover as much ground as possible before the ubiquitous rocks became slick rocks. We were particularly hoping to complete the climb out of Lehigh Gap before the rain settled in. 
The climb out of Lehigh Gap is another AT icon. The New Jersey Zinc Corporation ran a smelting operation for over 80 years in the town of Palmerton. Heavy metal emissions from the smelting operation completely denuded the slopes of the neighboring Blue Mountain, which in turn led to severe erosion. The whole area is now a Superfund site. This is where the 1000 foot climb occurs. Portions of the climb are almost vertical and require climbing hand over hand up the bare rock face. 
We hoofed about six miles over rocky trail to reach the Lehigh Valley. As we came down the ridge, we discussed the possibility of hitching into nearby Palmerton for lunch before starting the climb.  Sitting Bull, who is a later riser but faster hiker, caught up to us as we were debating and said that it was supposed to start raining any minute. As it began to sprinkle, the three of us decided the best course of action was to forgo lunch and climb while the rocks were dry. Good choice. 
The climb was everything it was advertised to be. Many times we had to put down our hiking poles to be able to use our hands to pull ourselves up the rock face. If you were to lose your balance - easy to do with a 35 pound backpack on your back - you would get seriously hurt. To add to the experience, we were all carrying extra weight because the upcoming ridgeline has no water, so we had to fill up all our containers with water before starting our he climb, adding an additional 5 pounds to our packs. The three of us took our time on the ascent and made it safely to the top. 
For being such Brave & Fierce thru hikers, we were rewarded with a couple miles of smooth, rock-free trail. What a glorious couple miles that was; but, lest we begin to think that Pennsylvania was going soft on us,  it was no time before we were back in the rocks with a vengeance. To add to the misery, the rain settled into a steady downpour. Ugh. 
We slowly trudged along for another 6.5 miles in the pouring rain, until we arrived at Delp Spring. This part of the ridge was flat enough to accommodate a few tents, so we decided to stop for the night to rest our poor, battered feet. I set up my tarp to give us a place to prepare our food and hang out out of the pouring rain. There is nothing more miserable than hanging out in a damp tent for several hours waiting for the rain to abate. The tarp at least gave us a dry place to congregate. 
We thought that most of the people around us had hiked on an additional six miles to the shelter;however, it turns out that they were all behind us and began arriving one by one. When they saw us hanging out under the tarp, they all decided that they were sick of the rain and ready to stop for the day. Pretty soon, we had twelve people under the tarp. It was tight quarters; but, a lot of fun. Everyone was grateful that I was not an ultralight hiker and was willing to hike with a large tarp. They were also very excited about the two King Size dark chocolate candy bars 1st Sgt and I had to share with the group. 
The rain has finally abated and we are all in our tents or hammocks for the night. We are all hoping for sunny days until we can get out of PA and off these rocks.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter, PA

It rained off and on all night. I stayed dry under my tarp; however, I had to pack up the wet tarp in the morning. Have I mentioned that I hate packing up wet equipment?
1st Sgt and I were the first ones out of camp this morning - as usual. Older hikers always get started earlier than the younger ones; but, they also tend to get passed during the day. Younger hikers also tend to take more breaks while older ones continue to trudge ever onward. Sort of a tortoise and hare kinda thing. So, we end up at the same place in the evening. It works out really well. 
The rocks continue unabated. We have moved from the big slabs of rock to little pointy rocks that just shred your feet and twist your ankles. Although my feet hurt, mainly because my boots are a little tight, 1st Sgt's feet are really torn up and blistered. As a result, he is really suffering. 
We were making for Wind Gap, 10.6 miles away, where I had a new pair of size 14 boots waiting for me. It threatened rain all morning; but, the rain held off and we finally made our way into town. 
The plan was to hike the 0.8 miles into town, go to the pizza place and order pizza, run to the Post Office next door while the pizza baked and grab the boots, eat lunch, and head back out of town. The best laid plans of mice and men...
The pizza place was closed, so we walked to the Beer Stein. The Beer Stein was closed, so we walked to the Broadway Cafe. The Broadway Cafe was closed, so we moved on down the street looking for somewhere open to eat. All the while, 1st Sgt was hobbling along. Pretty soon, we were almost two miles from the trailhead. 
We eventually decided that it would be a good idea to rest 1st Sgt's feet and get a room at the Travel Inn Motel. The Travel Inn is not only the trashiest motel that I've stayed in on the trail, including the Doyle and the Franklin Budget Inn, it is without a doubt the trashiest motel I've EVER been in. It appears to have many guests who live here full time, with grills and Big Wheels outside the rooms. 
Our shower has no cold water, just water so scalding hot that you can't stand in it. The only light in the room is a lamp. If you turn on the air conditioner, the lamp goes out.  There are pieces of plywood where I assume the closet used to be. There is an old cathode style TV on the ""dresser"" that is missing a drawer. 
While 1st Sgt rested his feet, I walked back to the post office and picked up my boots. I now have happy toes. I also stopped by the CVS and Autozone and picked up Epsom salts and a pan for 1st Sgt to soak his feet. His toes are also happier now. 
Our friends Matador, Tin Man, and Dirty Harry are in the same motel. Matador came to visit and introduced us to our next door neighbor who he had met while looking for us. She invited herself in and told us all about the ""vortex"" behind the plywood boards. She was very nice and just a little crazy. At least, I hope she's crazy and there's not really a vortex in our room. 
Tomorrow we have to hoof it 16 miles to Delaware Water Gap (after walking back across town) to be there by 4:00 PM to meet Marguerite. She's coming to town for a day for an early anniversary celebration. Our 20th wedding anniversary is on the 13th; but, her schedule worked better for her to come this week. We will take a zero day on Wednesday.  1st Sgt plans to rest his feet at the hiker hostel while Marguerite and I stay at the nearby Hampton Inn and take care of zero day chores, such as resupply, laundry, getting my hiking poles repaired (they both lost their metal tips on the rocks), and drive back to Eckville Shelter to pick up my Kindle that I left there last Friday. Happy anniversary, indeed!
Hopefully, after Delaware Water Gap and the PA/NJ border, the rocks will finally let up and our feet can get back to normal. In the meantime, I'm really excited about seeing Marguerite tomorrow and taking a zero day on Wednesday. That is, if we don't get sucked into the vortex tonight...","Delp Spring Campsite

1st Sgt and I survived the Night of the Vortex. We speculate that it was the Air Conditioner of Protection that got us through.  Let me explain - while our crazy meth-head neighbor Tracy was explaining the Vortex to us yesterday, and its connection to Hell, and her past interactions with gods and devils (I'm not making this up!), 1st Sgt turned on the air conditioner and promptly shut down the power to the outlets on that side of the room.
We were discussing walking over to the main office (no phone in the room) to talk to the manager about getting a new room or at least restoring the power when Tracy says, ""Wait! I can fix this! Give me something to plug in."" 1st Sgt gave her his phone charger and she walked over to the plug on the opposite wall, plugged in the phone charger and wiggled it around and, amazingly enough, the air conditioner roared back to life! 
At one point during the night, I sort of recall the air conditioner kicking off and 1st Sgt jumping out of bed and wiggling the outlet to get it working again. I could've sworn that when the air conditioner went off, the boards over the Vortex began to bulge as if something was pushing on them from the other side. When the air conditioner came back on, the bulging subsided.  I guess I could've dreamed the bulging boards part... We discussed the incident over breakfast at Dunkin Donuts this morning and concluded that the Air Conditioner of Protection probably saved us. 
We had to hike 1.9 miles to the trailhead, then an additional 15.5 miles to Delaware Water Gap, where Marguerite was picking me up for a zero day. 1st Sgt's feet were pretty sore and he was worried about us being late to meet Marguerite, so, once we were back on trail, he urged me to hike on ahead. 
The rocks were worse than ever, so I quickly outpaced 1st Sgt and left him behind. After awhile, it started thundering and lightninging. Then the heavens opened up, making the rocks even slicker than before and soaking me to the skin. I continued to hike for awhile; but, before long, I just couldn't stand it. This was the type of day where you really needed a hiking companion, especially if you were already hurting. 
I turned around and started hiking back to 1st Sgt. Before long, we were reunited and I think he was pretty pleased I came back. We continued northward and eventually reached Wolf Rocks. This section consisted of big tilted slabs of rock that were really slick. It was nice to cross it with someone else in case one of us slipped. In fact, we later talked to two younger thru hikers who fell crossing this section. 
After more adventures on the lovely PA rocks, we eventually reached Delaware Water Gap. Marguerite's plane ended up getting delayed, so we still managed to beat her to town. We found the Presbyterian hiking hostel where 1st Sgt planned to zero and rest his feet. It was like Old Home Week there, with Silly Spilly, Pluck, Shenaniguy, Sitting Bull, Lotus, Wizard, and Peace already there, and Matador, Tin Man, and Dirty Harry arriving soon thereafter. 
Marguerite picked me up in sheet order and we headed over to a hotel in Stroudsburg where we will zero tomorrow and take care of typical zero day chores. 1st Sgt is zeroing at the hostel, resting his feet and deciding what to do about his battered feet. On Thursday morning, we will enter New Jersey, where we hope we will soon see the end of the rocks.","Travel Inn, Wind Gap, PA

Zero Day - yay! Zero Day with Marguerite - even yayer! In true zero Day fashion, we didn't really do anything but zero day chores. We went to the grocery store for resupply, ate, washed clothes, ate, and drove back to Eckville Shelter to retrieve my Kindle reader. Oh yeah, we also ate. 
It took us over an hour each way to drive back to Eckville Shelter; but, what an amazing stroke of luck that I forgot my Kindle at one of the very few shelters on the trail that you could drive to. And one of the few shelters that had a caretaker who could go look and see if I had actually left it there in the first place. 
Tomorrow, Marguerite heads back to TN and 1st Sgt and I cross the Delaware River and head into a new state. Hopefully, one with fewer rocks.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

I think we may finally be leaving the accursed PA rocks behind! Woo hoo!  Marguerite and I started the day early at the Hampton Inn in Stroudsburg, PA. She had a noon flight from the Newark airport; but, had to drop me off, drive back to the airport, and drop off the rental car first. 
We were back over at the Church of the Mountain hostel by 7:00 AM and she was on her way. I hung out visiting with other hikers while 1st Sgt finished packing. The place was packed! Lots of people I'd never met before. 
We hit the trail by 7:30 AM and were soon crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey. I was so glad to see PA in the rear view mirror (Ok. I don't really have a rear view mirror on my pack - it's just an expression). PA has been my least favorite state so far. It had limited views, lots of rain, and those freaking rocks! The only really fun part was the climb out of Lehigh Gap. 
So far, NJ has been great. After crossing the river, we climbed back up onto the ridge. The climb was fairly long, but not too steep. And, yes, we were still contending with leftover PA rocks. In fact, we had rocks almost all day; however, they weren't as bad as PA and they are beginning to peter out. 
We also had many more views! We walked along the edge of a ridge most of the day and had views of farmlands down in the valley below. And the woods are much more open and airy. And we had sunshine all day! And did I mention the ponds? We passed a couple of big, pretty ponds. And a really cool fire tower!
About 10 miles into the hike, we stopped at the Mohican Outdoor Center, which is operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. I bought a Ruben sandwich, a coke, and a choco taco. Even though we just left town, we never pass up an opportunity for more town food. 
The rest of the afternoon was spent hiking along a pleasant ridgeline. Since we were stealth camping at a site that did not have water, we had to carry four liters of water for several miles. It's always a shame to have to add more weight to the pack; but, sometimes it can't be helped. 
1st Sgt and I are now camped on the ridge with Wizard, a young Flip Flopper from VA. We expected several more people to stop here; but, a few passed by and several more apparently didn't come this far today. That's fine. The three of us are enjoying a pleasant evening and Wizard actually built a fire. By now, most NOBOs have quit building fires; but, if the Flip Floppers, who are still in the honeymoon phase of their hikes, want to build fires, we are happy to sit by them. All in all, I think I will enjoy New Jersey.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

I passed a milestone today - over 1000 miles hiked! Woo hoo! We are still loving New Jersey. The rocks are still here; but, they are regular trail rocks. They aren't nasty, sneaky, poky PA rocks. The smoother trail and relatively flat trail profile allowed us to put in our first 20+ mile day in a long time. 
It was a pretty chilly night last night, with lows in the mid-40s. My down quilt felt quite toasty this morning, so I had a hard time dragging myself out of the hammock. 1st Sgt didn't appear to be moving much faster. As a result, we didn't get on the trail until 7:30 AM. 
It was another beautiful, sunny day, so we quickly warmed up. We once again had nice views along the ridgeline and passed several pretty ponds and saw several larger lakes down in the valley. We are definitely in geography influenced by glaciers. Although I'm no geologist, I suspect that all the rocks in PA were laid down by receding glaciers. 
We quickly covered 12 miles in the morning and arrived at Culver's Gap around noon. Gyp's Tavern is located 0.2 miles off trail at Culver's Gap. You know what that means - town food for lunch! Woo hoo! We hung out at Gyp's for about an hour, eating lunch and charging our electronics. They were very hiker friendly and I recommend it to anyone hiking the AT. 
After lunch, we had to climb out of Culver's Gap (remember that gap is a four letter word!) with full bellies, which made us very sluggish hikers. We soon got back into the rhythm though and started eating away at the final 8 miles of the day. At one point, we came upon a covered pavilion at Sunrise Mt. We arrived to find Dogmouse and Wizard there listening to a man playing a guitar. What a pleasant scene! 360 degree views, full sun, cooling breezes, and an acoustic soundtrack. 
Alas, we still had 3.8 miles to cover to reach the shelter. So, we headed out with Dogmouse and Wizard. With Dogmouse leading out, we made short work of the miles and arrived at the shelter a little after 5:00 PM. There ate ten of us here tonight, including an ATC ridge runner. I am comfortably ensconced in my hammock and looking forward to more days like today.","Stealth site at Mile 1310, NJ

We had a ""Holiday Hike"" today, as 1st Sgt named it. Believe me, I realize how lucky I am to be out here doing this hike; but, some days it just feels like work. You get up, break camp, hike 10-12 hours, set up camp, eat, go to bed. The days where you slog through rain or through the green tunnel with no views feel even more like work. Today wasn't like that. 
Today we only hiked 13.5 miles; but, we packed a lot in. We awoke to another beautiful day and were on trail by 7:15 AM. It was just a few miles to High Point State Park, which included the highest point in NJ (1860 ft). We had seen a sign in the shelter the day before telling us that thru hikers could get a free soda at the High Point State Park visitor's center, so we were excited to get there. It's amazing how food-driven thru hikers are!
After our free soda we visited with a nearby Boy Scout troop and talked to them about our thru hike. One scout thought my kilt was really cool and wished he'd worn his (I bet he gets made fun of a lot). We then headed out toward the actual high point. 
On the way, while stepping over a fallen log, my right foot got snagged. Unfortunately, my backpack didn't realize my boot was communing with a log and kept on hiking. The result was me sprawled out face down on the trail. After ascertaining that I was unhurt, 1st Sgt asked me to stay where I was until he could get his phone and save the picture for posterity. I politely declined (Ok, so the declination may not have been all that polite). It's amazing that I survived the rocks of PA to be taken down by a log! Oh well, nothing bruised but my pride!
We eventually reached the highest point in NJ after taking a 0.2 mile blue blaze trail to the summit, which has a 220 ft tall obelisk at the top. For some reason, we decided it would be a good idea to climb 291 steps to the top of the obelisk to look out a hazy narrow window. At least we were smart enough to leave our packs below. 
After descending, we were soon on our way again. The rest of the day, the trail trended downward, passing through old farm fields and wetlands. It was a very pleasant and enjoyable hike. We kept flip flopping with a young female thru hiker from Poland named Zebra. We would pass her and stop to look at something and she would pass us back. She appears to hike at a steady 2 mph and does not stop for anything. She started her hike in GA over a month after us, so the technique appears to be working for her thus far. 
We came to a road crossing at County Rt 519 and were met by two friends of 1st Sgt. They are two geocaching friends of his who are both named Sue and collectively go by the name The Sooz (they are not to be confused with my two running friends named Sue who collectively go by the name The Suez). They were geocaching in the area and had decided to do some trail magic. They had brought fruit, sodas, snickers bars, chips, and home made brownies. Score! We hung out visiting with them and Zebra for quite awhile. 
We eventually moved on, passing through more stone wall bordered fields and pretty woods and wetlands. We were making for the town of Unionville, NY, where we planned to resupply and spend the night in the park behind the city hall (with permission from the city, of course). We are not done hiking in NJ yet; however, the AT passes so close to the border that the town we were hiking to was in NY. 
We even lucked out and were offered a ride into town from the trailhead. Score again! You know how much thru hikers hate to walk non-trail miles. We were under the impression that there was a shelter with showers behind the city hall. It turns out that they only had a portajohn and a small picnic pavilion. Not even an outdoor electrical outlet to recharge our electronics. Bummer. Getting our clothes laundered was out of the question. 
The Sooz had arranged to meet us for dinner  at the pizza place in Unionville. When they arrived and we told them of our disappointing accommodations, they offered to drive us to a hotel near theirs (it was already fully booked). We were able to make arrangements for a local motel and headed to dinner. During dinner, Sitting Bull texted saying he was in Unionville. He soon joined us at the pizza place and took us up on our offer for floor space in our motel room. 
We are now in our motel room. It is adequate, if not fancy; however, there is no Vortex to Hell, so we are good!  We are showered, 1st Sgt laundered our dirty clothes at the Sooz's hotel, and we are even resupplied thanks to the Sooz running us to Walmart (thanks for everything, ladies!).

Today's hike was more like a work day than yesterday; but, it was a fun day at work. 1st Sgt, Sitting Bull, and I were up at 5:00 AM because the Sooz were picking us up at 6:00 AM. A quick stop at Dunkin Donuts and a drive back to Unionville put us on the trail by 7:20 AM. Thanks again to the Sooz for all their kind assistance. 
It was another beautiful, clear morning which held the potential for a hot afternoon. We had a good blend of terrain today - flat trail next to wetlands, boardwalks through wetlands, a couple of big climbs, and up-and-down ridge walking. 
After a few miles through pastures and wetlands, we arrived at Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. We walked on open trails around the edge of the wetlands. With no trees for shade, it was beginning to warm up considerably. As we traversed the wetlands, we came upon an incredible sight - a turtle laying eggs! It was so cool! She had dug a hole and, as she laid each egg, she would cover it with dirt using her back legs. We must have watched for 20 minutes. It was amazing that such a small creature could have so many eggs in her. 
As we left the wildlife refuge we came upon trail magic in the form of cold sodas. Perfect! Just what we needed on such a warm morning. The sugar also helped fuel us as we climbed up and over Pochuck Mt. 
By the time we descended, it was lunch time! We ate lunch at the southern end of the Pochuck Boardwalk. There were several weekend hikers who were curious about our hike. So, we hung out for quite awhile answering their questions. 
After lunch, we crossed the Pochuck Boardwalk, a 0.9 mile boardwalk through the open wetlands. With no shade. And temperatures that had risen into the nineties. It was a very pretty section of the hike and there were Day hikers everywhere; but, it was hot!
The Pochuck Boardwalk was petty; but, the farmer's market at the end with drinks and ice cream was even prettier! As we sat enjoying our ice cream, all our friends began arriving: Sitting Bull, Shenaniguy, Silly Spilly, Pluck, Crazy Tree, Keller, Sauce, and Snooze, to name a few. We were all taking a little respite before we began the big climb of the day. 
If you will recall when I was discussing Jacob's Ladder way back in NC, I said that it was a bad sign if a geographic feature was significant enough to get a name. Well, this one was called ""Stairway to Heaven"".  It was a 1000 ft climb consisting mostly of rock steps. 
1st Sgt and I were the first ones to head out. Luckily, it turned out that the entire climb was in the shade. As it was, by the time we reached the top, we were drenched in sweat. We passed many local day hikers on the way up who marveled at our climbing ability, with full packs, no less! We, of course, were quite blasé about it and waited until we got out of sight of them to huff and puff. 
We were rewarded for our climb with a spectacular view back over the wetlands we had previously traversed. After enjoying the view and catching our breaths, we set out to finish the last five miles of the day's hike. As is often the case, these last miles were just plain work. We hiked along the ridgeline with no views and several PUDS (pointless ups and downs). At this point, it was after 5:00 PM, so we just put our heads down and hiked. 
We eventually arrived at the shelter and set up camp for the evening. Pretty soon, everyone started rolling in. It now looks like a tent city with probably 20-25 people here, including our old buddy Ramsey Bolton, who managed to catch up today. I would have to put this day near the top of the 'Good Hiking Days' list.","Ramsey, NJ

Today's hike felt more like a work day hike than a holiday hike. It was hot, rocky, mosquito-filled, and just plain work. The AWOL guide described the section like this: ""Despite the unimposing profile, rocks and abrupt ups & downs make this section challenging."" They weren't kidding. We spent most of the day scrambling up and down large boulders. At one point, the rock face even had rebar rungs to assist in the climb. 
Temperatures in the low 90s only added to the discomfort today. I know we complain when we walk in the rain all day; but, the heat just wilts you. And it seems that no matter how much tepid water you drink, you just can't quench your thirst. Of course, since we spent much of the day on big rock faces, we spent a lot of time in the full sun. 
There were good aspects to the day also. We entered New York this morning - our 9th state. We also got some pizza for trail magic. We had planned to stop at the hot dog stand for lunch and then go to the ice cream store for dessert. It turns out that the hot dog stand is closed on Mondays. So, we were waiting for the ice cream store to open with High Life and Chef when a trail angel stopped and gave us pizza. Woo hoo! We then proceeded to have incredible chocolate shakes. 
After lunch, we felt sluggish in the afternoon heat and struggled to reach the Wildcat Shelter, where we took a much-needed break and drank cold water from the spring. Eventually, we moved on and put in another five miles to the stealth site where we are spending the night. 
Water has been an issue in this section. Most of the water sources are run-off from ponds. The water is very tannic and unappealing. It's kind of funny - we get used to access to ice cold spring water straight from the earth. So, we get kind of picky when it comes to water. These sources are sluggish and the water is brown. Luckily, just 0.1 miles short of where we planned to camp for the night, a wonderful trail angel had left 11 gallons of water. It was still cold! Woo hoo!
We have eaten and stowed our bear bags and are now lying in our shelters (tent & hammock) sweltering. It's too buggy to be outside of our big nets. It is still mid-80s at dusk and not a hint of a breeze. Hopefully, the exhaustion from the day's labors will win out over the stifling air.","Wawayanda Shelter, NJ

First off, let me say ""Happy 20th Anniversary"" to the most patient woman I know. My wife Marguerite has endured my various endeavors over the years, such as Wilderness Search & Rescue and being an on-call paramedic while also working a full-time job as a chemist. And now she's keeping the home fires burning while I am out here living out a long held dream. 
Today was one of the toughest I've experienced out here in quite awhile. We are into our third day of heat in the 90+ degree range. That kind of heat just seems to sap all the energy right out of you. As soon as we started hiking, 1st Sgt and I were drenched in sweat. And no amount of water seems to cool you down.
Speaking of water, caches left by incredible trail angels saved us again today. The water sources listed in AWOL's guide continue to be sluggish, brown, unappealing little trickles that are typically outflows from ponds or bogs. Three times at road crossings today we came across gallon jugs of water. Someone is taking the time to fill these jugs of water and haul them out to the trail just so people they've never met will have fresh water to drink. Amazing!
For some reason, I was under the impression that once we passed Delaware Water Gap it would be smooth sailing through NJ, NY, and CT all the way up to Mt Greylock in Massachusetts. Well, it turns out that the terrain in NY is pretty tough. We spent our second day scrambling up and down over big rocks, sometimes slowing down to a crawl as we negotiated climbs or steep descents. And for some reason they don't appear to believe in switchbacks here!
I actually have a theory. Remember all the devastating wildfires along the southern portion of the AT last year? I think that all the switchbacks in TN and GA were burned up. When the ATC went to order new switchbacks, they found they were on backorder due to all the Western wildfires. They decided it was more important to make it easier for all the NOBOs just starting out. So, they yanked all the switchbacks out of NY and shipped them south, leaving behind rocky ascents straight up the mountainsides.  I assume they'll replace them sometime in the future. I just hope they don't use cheap Chinese ones that erode in just a couple of years.  
All kidding aside, some of these ascents made for dangerous hiking. A young college aged hiker we know named Snooze took a nasty tumble off a particularly tricky climb. His backpack took the brunt of the impact; however, he still ended up with scrapes and a fairly ugly puncture wound on his right calf. Passing hikers helped his sister Sauce patch him up, so by the time we saw them he was doing pretty well. I did insist on examining and cleaning the wound when we got to the shelter tonight. Everyone in the shelter gathered around to watch the show. They were all pretty amazed when I pulled out a set of nitrile gloves. BSI...scene safety...(never mind, it's an EMT joke). I also told him he needs to get the wound checked when we get to town tomorrow. 
We at least were able to make a stop at the lake in Harriman State Park this afternoon and buy cold sodas and Powerades. We ended up sitting at the pavilion way too long waiting for the heat to abate. As a result, we ended up stopping at a shelter four miles earlier than planned. When we got there, we found that everyone else had suffered just as much with the heat and terrain. That at least made us feel a little better and not quite so much like wimps. 
In the long run the shortened day won't make a big difference. We planned a six mile Nearo into Fort Montgomery for tomorrow anyway. We will just have to try to get an earlier start to knock down the added milesn. I hate losing mileage all the same. At this point, whereas 1st Sgt and others passed the halfway point back in PA, I still have more miles left to hike than what I've already covered. When we reach Katahdin, I will still have 320 miles left to hike in VA. I imagine, standing on Katahdin high-fiving with my friends, that I will feel like that kid that got to don the cap and gown and walk across the stage at Graduation; however, instead of receiving my diploma, I got a blank piece of paper tied with a ribbon and an invitation to attend summer school to finish that last class that I missed - ""The topography of Central Virginia"". 
At least we won't have the heat to deal with tomorrow. We had a cold front, complete with thunder, lightening, and rain, move through this evening and drop the temperature a good twenty degrees. High temperatures for tomorrow are forecast to be in the 70s. Yay.","Stealth Site in NY

Today's hike was much better than yesterday. A cold front moved through last night, dropping the temperatures. It was pretty muggy today; but, temperatures were only in the low 80s, making for much more comfortable hiking. 
We headed out around 7:00 AM. We only had ten miles to go to get to town. We were out of food, our clothes were so salt-encrusted from sweat that they stood up on their own, and we smelled bad. Really bad. So, we were in desperate need of a town day. 
The terrain was still very much up and down; however, the trail volunteers had done an excellent job of grading the trail and adding stone steps to the steep parts. So, we were able to move along at a pretty good clip. 
It wasn't long until we reached the four lane Palisades Parkway, where we got to play Frogger across the busy morning rush hour traffic. There was a visitor's center in the median a short distance from where we crossed. So, we took the opportunity to walk down and raid the vending machines, charge our phones, and use the flush toilets. 
A few more miles of hiking brought us to Bear Mountain, overlooking the Hudson River. At one point, we were actually able to see some of the New York City Skyline in the distance. This part of the trail is located in Harriman State Park and gets a lot of tourist use, so we saw a bunch of dayhikers. 
We descended off the ridge to the river, where the trail passed through the Trailside Zoo & Museum, featuring indigenous animals and a museum of the history of the area. The bear den was particularly disquieting. There were two bears in the pen, one of whom was lounging in a hammock. There were also about 50 vultures hanging out in the enclosure. 
Ironically enough, the bear enclosure is located at the lowest point on the entire trail, at 114 ft above sea level. I'm hoping these are either injured bears that cannot live on their own or just plain lazy bears who like lounging in hammocks all day. I consider the bears as kindred spirits and felt like they should be free to be out there trying to steal unwary hiker's food bags. In fact, we have been hearing about a particularly wily bear at Fingerboard Shelter (about 15 miles south of the zoo) who has been stealing hiker's bear bags out of the trees there. We ran into our thru hiker friend J who told us about the bear stealing two bags just last night. Unfortunately, these situations rarely end well for the bear. 
Once we reached the Bear Mountain Bridge, we called the Stony Point Center for a pickup since we had reservations for the night there. The Stony Point Center is a multi-denominational retreat center that takes in thru hikers for the night. It's a very nice place  with very friendly people. 
We got checked into our room, took showers, and got our laundry started. We then headed out to the store to resupply. The AWOL guide listed the grocery store as nearby. The lady who picked us up told us the store was located about a mile from the center. The hiker information packet they gave us at check-in listed the store as 1.5 miles from the center. It was closer to two miles away. Luckily, we got a ride to the store; but, we had to walk back. You know how much thru hikers hate to walk off-trail miles...
Upon returning from the store, we went to check on our clothes and both managed to leave our room keys in the room. Behind a locked door. Bummer. Our room was located on the first floor in one of the dormitory buildings located away from the main administration building. Rather than walk all the way to the administrative building just to admit that we had managed to lock ourselves out of our room, we decided the better course of action was to break into our room through the open window. Of course, you can guess who got elected to climb in the window. Better yet, 1st Sgt managed to record the act for all posterity. Since he went to all that trouble, I felt it was only fair to share the picture. 
After successful completion of our caper, it was time for dinner in the center's cafeteria. It was all you can eat (AYCE) - favorite words of all thru hikers. We were joined at our table by another thru hiker named Pa John. I figure the three of us ate as much as the rest of the guests combined. 
We are now clean, laundered, fed, and rested. Tomorrow, we cross the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge and continue our way north. We should be in Connecticut (""Gateway to New England"") by the end of the week. It is less than 800 miles to Katahdin. Although it's still soft, Katahdin's call continues to grow.","William Brien Memorial Shelter, NY

I had a flash of scientific insight while hiking today, and it is this: rocks - at least large ones - cannot swim. For the past few days we've been struggling with scrambling up and down over big rocks. Today we crossed over the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. The big rocks are gone. Based on this observation, it can be hypothesized that the big rocks were stopped in their northern migration by the Hudson River. Ergo, big rocks cannot swim. There are still smaller rocks, so apparently there is a point where the rocks get too heavy to swim - but that is a study for another time. Let's just hope they don't figure out how to cross the bridge. God, I love Science!
The absence of big rocks and high temperatures meant we had a nice hiking day. 1st Sgt and I started out the morning around 7:00 AM with another ""Old Guy"" hiker named Pa John who had spent the night at a Stony Point Center. After crossing the bridge, it was the typical post-town day. Full bellies, heavy packs, and a steep ascent. Yada, yada, yada. After attaining the ridge, though, it was a pleasant day of hiking. This is what I imagined hiking through NJ, NY, and CT would be like all along.  
After awhile, we came to a road crossing and there was a convenience store/deli that was not listed in the AWOL guide. We quickly took advantage of the unexpected gift f on the Hiking Gods to have second breakfast. While purchasing said breakfast, I realized that two of the people in line were EMTs. I asked if I could get nitrile gloves from them to replace the pair that I used while cleaning Snooze's wounds the other day. They were more than happy to oblige. How cool is that!?
While we were sitting at the picnic table out front, who should arrive but Wizard, Pluck, and Silly Spilly? Shenaniguy was having some foot problems, so he had hitched forward and was zeroing at the state park to rest his foot. No sooner did our friends arrive  when we had another great surprise. Ramsey Bolton arrived with a friend in tow who had come out to hike a few days. Ramsey had already given his friend a trailname and any Game of Thrones fan will marvel at Ramsey's brilliance.  His friend's trailname is Reek!
After second breakfast, our mini bubble set out for the State Park, where we all planned to camp. It wasn't long until the young hikers had left us old guys behind; but, we would spend the rest of the day crossing paths as one group or the other stopped for water, lunch, etc. What a fun day!
During one of the stops, Wizard told us of his encounter with the Fingerboard Shelter bear a couple of days ago. He had night-hiked into the shelter, arriving well after dark. As he was quietly eating his dinner so as not to disturb the other hikers in the shelter, the bear walked up to him. He tried shooing the bear away, but to no avail. He said the bear gave him a look so as to say, ""You're an idiot"" and sauntered over to the nearby tree containing bear bags, climbed the tree, snatched up two bags by their ropes, and commenced to feast. Apparently, other hikers were not able to scare off the bear, who hung out most of the rest of the night. Like I've said before, unfortunately, this scenario will not end well for the bear in the long run. 
We eventually arrived at the State Park Campground, where the whole group, along with a few other hikers, is set up for the night. The park offers thru hikers one night of free camping, where we have access to bathrooms, showers, running water, electricity, and a nearby pizza place that will deliver to the campground. Heaven! We were expecting Sitting Bull and Hoops to arrive; but, they didn't make it in. We will probably see them on the trail tomorrow. We are also expecting rain tomorrow.

Hiking conditions this morning were almost perfect. Sunshine filtered through high clouds, temps in the 60s, and a soft breeze. Unfortunately, 1st Sgt and I both were feeling sluggish today. I don't know if it was the long day yesterday or just cumulative fatigue over the past few days; but, we just weren't feeling it today. My joints hurt and I just had no energy (don't worry - I don't think it's Lyme Disease or anything, just one of those days). 
We trudged our way to the ten mile point,  where there was a deli 0.4 miles off-trail. We went there for lunch. They had a nice picnic table behind the deli and a water faucet and power outlets for charging - the important things. As we ate, it continued to cloud up. The Weather Channel app was predicting rain and it looked like they were going to be right. 
We decided to make for the Morgan Stewart shelter and try to beat the rain. As we hiked, the air got heavier and the rain felt more and more imminent. 1st Sgt and I pretty much hiked in silence today. Nothing really wrong, just one of those days for reflection. About a half mile before the shelter, the rain finally arrived. Luckily, we were able to reach it before we got too wet. 
There were four section hikers and Pa John already here when we arrived. We've spent the afternoon dozing and hanging out, visiting with the other hikers. We are staying in the shelter tonight to keep our equipment dry. Everyone else rolled in. We now have about 20 people camping here. A couple people built a fire and everyone is hanging out and enjoying each other's company.  Hopefully, tomorrow will be a more energetic day. We are hearing rumors of trail magic just across the Connecticut border...","Clarence Farhnestock State Park, NY

Today's hike was much better than yesterday. As my friend Sue said, I got the pep back in my step. I suspect I may have had a little bug of some sort. I had no energy and my joints from my hips down all ached. Without going into details, I also had some gastric discomfort I had attributed to rich deli food. 
All that was gone today and 1st Sgt, who was also feeling peppier, and I were able to step it out. One issue, though, was that it had rained all night and the woods were all drippy and wet. This, of course, made the rocks very slick. We both ended up taking pretty hard falls. I banged up my left elbow and he banged up his right hip; but, no permanent damage to either of us. 
The trail was very nice today. Some ups and downs; but, nothing too extreme, and the treadway was pretty smooth. We also saw some pretty cool sights.
 The first one was Nuclear Lake. There was a plutonium research facility located there from the 1950s to the 1970s, when they had an explosion that contaminated the lake and surrounding shoreline. It was remediated years ago and the facility is long gone. What's left is a beautiful lake, teeming with fish, geese, and beaver. AWOL's guide does warn you not to drink the water or swim in the lake, though. As we were passing the northern end of the lake, I heard a woodpecker banging on a tree; but, I could have sworn that it was a Geiger counter going off. 
We continued hiking through bogs, farm fields, and across rural roads all day. At one of these crossings we passed, the Dover Oak, the largest tree we will see on the AT. It was HUGE! I assume it's a couple of hundred years old. Imagine everything it has seen in its lifetime. I think when a tree gets that big, it must attain a certain amount of wisdom. I just wish we could hear what it has to tell us. 
Shortly, after leaving the Dover Oak, we came to another unusual sight. The AT actually has its own train stop. On weekends, you can catch a train from the AT and ride it to Penn Station in Manhattan. Many of our friends have taken zero days in New York City. Even better than the train stop was the deli located nearby. We were able to stop in and have a huge sandwich while we recharged our electronic devices. If you are ever in Pawling, NY, I highly recommend you stop at Tony's Deli. It was 0.7 miles off-trail; but, definitely worth the 1.4 mile round trip. 
Of course after eating a huge lunch, dragging our stuffed bellies up a long hill was torture, especially in muggy heat. Oh well, it was totally worth it. 
After a few more miles of rolling trail, we reached the Wiley Shelter. It is a fairly small shelter that sleeps six. Although the expected rain never came during the day, thunderstorms are expected overnight. So, 1st Sgt and I opted to sleep in the shelter to keep our equipment dry. We are sharing it with a woman in her 40s named Jessie's Girl. Her hiking partner, Grace Note, is set up in her tent near the shelter. All the rest of the regular cast of characters is here tonight: Sitting Bull, Hoops (she's back from registering for college), Moonshiner, Chipmunk, Mantis, Ramsey and Reek. 
Reek has to catch the train back to the city tomorrow. As a reminder of his time on-trail, he's left with a raw and chewed up left heel. I cleaned and patched it up as well as I could with supplies from my rapidly shrinking first aid kit. Hopefully, we got padded enough for him to hike the five miles he has to go tomorrow.

Today was a busy day. We crossed another state off the list, we hiked 20 miles, we resupplied, and we got trail magic. 
It rained on and off all night, so we awoke to drippy woods and overcast skies. We got up and out before 7:00 AM because we knew we had a big day planned. Luckily, by sleeping in the shelter, we weren't packing up wet gear. 
Shortly after heading out, we crossed the NY-CT border. Almost immediately, we started climbing and spent the rest of the day going up and down. It seems like every new state we enter has to show us how tough it is and hits us with something difficult. After awhile, it decides we've learned our lesson and settles down. 
We needed some resupply items, so we stopped at the Bull Bridge Country Store. What a great place! They were very hiker-friendly and allowed us to charge our phones while we shopped. 
With resupply done, we headed back to the up and down. The expected rain never materialized. In fact, the sun made an appearance in the afternoon. However, the high humidity made the hike pretty unpleasant. We were soaked in sweat all day long. In fact, my socks were so wet and salty that the skin on my arches was rubbed raw. I have cleaned them up the best I can; however, I'm pretty concerned about how they'll do tomorrow. 
As we came down the hill to CT Rt 341 we heard voices and I said that maybe we'd get trail magic today. As we approached the road, this guy said, ""Hey Beaker! Come have some trail magic!"" It turns out the trail magic was for us! It was provided by a former thru hiker named Scoops. I had met Scoops and his wife Iceberg at the 2015 Flip Flop festival. He has been following me on TrsilJournals and decided to drive 50 miles and track us down. What a spread! Fried chicken, sub sandwiches, Double Stuffed Oreos, cookies, candy, chips, drinks. Everything a they hiker craves. 
While we were feasting, along came Sauce, Snooze, Keller, and their friend (whose name escapes me now). Other hikers come along and we had quite a party along the side of the road. Thanks Scoops! It was great! I'm sorry Iceberg had to work and couldn't join us. I was also able to check up on Snooze's leg. He did go to a doctor and get antibiotics   And was doing much better. Yay!
Eventually, we had to quit feasting and move on. We still had to hike 7.5 miles, including the descent from St John's Ledges (remember what I've said about named features on the trail?). CT was still trying to show off, so the ascent to St John's Ledges was pretty tough. We passed Keller on the ascent and caught up with the others when they stopped to take in the view. 
Then came the descent. It was straight down and rocky. The others soon left us behind as we carefully picked our way down. Near the bottom of the descent, 1st Sgt said, ""Let's take a break.""  I replied, ""You want to make sure Keller does OK on the descent!"" ""Yep."" ""You're such a Dad!""  ""Yep. Happy Father's Day.""
Keller soon came along and safely negotiated the descent. CT, having decided that it showed us how tough it was, gave us a two mile flat hike along the Housatonic River to finish our day. We are now in the shelter (third night in a row in a shelter - I'm turning into such a wimp!) with Pa John and Mantis, listening to the rain. We are expecting two inches of rain tomorrow.

The weather reports have been predicting Big Rain for today for the past several days - up to two inches, with flash flooding possible. Our plan was to make for the next shelter, 10 miles away, and assess weather conditions before deciding wether to push on. Our ultimate goal is Salisbury, CT, on Tuesday. We have a room for the night and the earlier we arrive, the more time we will have in town. 
Our hike started out under gray skies and totally still air. It wasn't raining yet; but, rain would have been preferable to this high humidity and oppressive air. After hiking only a short while, our clothes were literally dripping with sweat. We actually stopped a couple of times at streams and rinsed out our clothes. They were soaking wet anyway, and dripping with clean water was better than dripping with sweat. 
As we hiked, the sun actually began to peak out and a breeze began to blow - how pleasant! After hiking all morning, we arrived at the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter just in time for lunch. Pretty soon, we had a pretty big crowd: Pa John, Spaz, Haiku & Wick (and their dog Baby Bear), Sauce, Snooze, Keller, Mantis, and Denise. Pa John and Spaz had already decided they were stopping for the night; but, everyone else planned to push on to the next shelter, which was 11 miles away. 
1st Sgt and I finished lunch and had decided to push on also when the skies turned dark, the wind picked up, and the thunder began rolling. The younger hikers all headed out to try to get as far along the trail as possible before the skies opened up. They didn't make it far. Pa John, Spaz, 1st Sgt, and I took cover in the shelter as the Heavens were ripped asunder. A fierce maelstrom raged for close to an hour. Pretty soon everyone around me was snoozing peacefully. I tried to nap too; but, lightening storms tend to energize me. I think it has something to do with all the positive ions generated by the lightening. 
Soon the storm passed and the sun came back out. I decided we should push on; but, 1st Sgt felt that it was getting too late in the day to push on to the next shelter and more bands of thunderstorms were on their way, so we should just stay put and hike it in to Salisbury tomorrow. I decided to go ahead and push on and meet up with him in Salisbury. I just haven't been feeling the Love on the trail the past couple of days and really needed some town time. 
I headed out under sunny skies and pleasant breezes. It lasted all of thirty minutes. Pretty soon another maelstrom was upon us. Thunder crashed, lightening flashed, and trees swayed crazily in the wind. I got soaked; however, since I've been wet, either from sweat or rain, for the past three days it really didn't matter. And, like I said, thunderstorms have always energized me, so I really enjoyed the hike. 
In a short while, the thunderstorm passed and the rain settled into a steady drizzle. The trail was a creek; but, my feet were so soaked it didn't matter. I stomped down through the middle of the puddles. The sensible thing would have been to stay safe, warm, and dry in the shelter and let the storms blow over; but, I am thru hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sensible went out the window months ago.
Of course, 11 miles in the pouring rain did start to get a bit long; but, at this point I was committed. You are only allowed to camp at established campsites in CT. So, it was on to the shelter. I arrived at the blue blazed trail that led to the shelter around 7:30 PM as it was getting dark and the fog was setting in. Of course, this shelter just had to sit 0.5 miles off the trail in a hollow down a steep and treacherous side trail. After what seemed like miles, I finally arrived. The shelter is full and there are about six tents in the tenting area, so I am set up in my hammock. 
Of course, everything is now soaked and my feet and hands look like prunes. That's OK though because tomorrow is a town day, so I can dry everything out, get clean, and recharge my batteries (both actual and metaphorical). Hopefully, I can get my feet healed up and get my mojo back. We are getting ready to head into Massachusetts and will be facing real mountains again.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter, CT

I awoke to sun and clear skies. Yay. I packed up and headed out. It was only a four mile hike into town, so I took my time packing. For only the second time on the trail, l did not hike in my kilt. I knew I was going to be able to do laundry today and I just couldn't stomach the thought of putting on my wet, dank hiking clothes one more time. So, I wore my camp clothes. 
The climb out from the shelter was very steep; however, once I hit the AT again, it was a cruise into town. I did have a few blow downs to deal with; but, nothing too bad. At one point, I stopped to get a drink of water and Sauce and Snooze, who left the shelter after me, caught up. They were scandalized that I was not hiking in my kilt. Sauce said it was like running into her teacher in the grocery store and they weren't wearing school clothes. I swore them to secrecy and said that we would never speak of the matter again. 
We hiked together the rest of the way into town, where Sauce was picking up a package at the post office. I then found Vanessa's house. She is a woman who has taken on thru hikers for years. I got settled in, got a shower, clothes washed, and set soaked equipment in the sun to dry. I then started looking for a doctor to look at my feet. 
I believe that days of wet feet and staying at less than reputable hotels may have led to vesicular athlete's foot. It's not quite like the common athlete's foot between your toes. It tends to occur under the thick skin on the soles of your feet. I also think the constant moisture and sweaty socks may have led a secondary bacterial infection. As a result, my feet are very sore and swollen. 
It turns out this town only has one doctor, who could not work me in. They also do not have a doc in the box. I talked to Vanessa and she gave me the name of a local doctor who does house calls. He only deals in cash and does not work with insurance companies. Hmm, sounds a little fishy... I called the guy and we discussed my symptoms. He at least sounded like he knew what he was talking about on the phone, so I went ahead and made an appointment for him to stop by this evening. 
1st Sgt and Pa John arrived around 1:00 PM and got settled in. We then went to look for lunch and ended up at the deli of the local grocery store - not too many restaurants to choose from in this town. While we were eating our lunch at the table outside the grocery store, a woman came up and asked if any of us needed denatured alcohol for our cook stoves. What a strange question! It turns out, however, that I indeed did need denatured alcohol for my cookstove. It also turns out that this woman was ""Trail Angel Linda"" and she always carried supplies for thru hikers in her car. Once again, how strange. Anyway, that solved the problem of me finding denatured alcohol for my cook stove. 
The rest of the day was spent relaxing and resting our sore tired feet. The doctor arrived around 7:00 PM. I really liked him. He did a thorough history and exam and most of all confirmed my diagnosis. He suggested I take several days off to rest my feet. However, having treated thru hikers in the past, he knew that wasn't happening. He then gave me antibiotics and antifungals and suggested I change out my socks as often as possible. 
1st Sgt and I are taking a zero day tomorrow to rest our feet. Hopefully, when we hit the trail on Thursday, our feet will be much better and we'll roll right through Massachusetts.","Limestone Spring Shelter, CT

Zero Day. Yay. I haven't taken many Zero Days. Usually, if I Nearo into town the day before, I have all my chores done and, by the time the Zero rolls around, I am itching to get back on the trail. This time was different. I devoted the day to taking care of my ailing feet. 
First thing this morning, I went to the pharmacy and got my prescription filled. Most of the rest of the day was spent sitting on the back deck at Vanessa's soaking my feet in Domeboro solution and keeping them elevated the rest of the time. My feet are definitely feeling better today; but, another day off of them was definitely called for. We did go across the street and resupply for our next leg of the hike.
Tomorrow we will cross into Massachusetts. It is looking like four days before we can resupply. At about 2 pounds a day, I generally don't like to carry more than three days of food; but, there appear to be fewer opportunities for stopping at delis for the next few days, so we will have to carry a little extra weight. We are also moving back into real mountains again, so the added weight is not welcomed. 
We got a text from Sitting Bull that he, Hoops, his brother Krampus, and Ramsey Bolton would be stopping in Salisbury for lunch and resupply, so we walked back to the grocery store and visited with them. I also heard from Shenaniguy, who is about a day behind us, that he had just met Hummingbird. If you recall, Hummingbird hiked with us, along with Ramsey, Hoops, Sitting Bull, and Krampus, through TN and Southern VA. I haven't seen him since Marion, VA, and hope we get to meet up again. It would be fun to get the old group back together for a day or two. 
The rest of the day was spent hanging out and resting our feet. I am a bit concerned about hitting the trail again tomorrow; but, I can't just hang out in Salisbury any longer. This town is pretty expensive! I worry that if my feet don't get better fast, I may be forced to go off trail for a week of rehabilitation. It's amazing how fast this whole thing came on and serves as a reminder of how easily you can get knocked off the trail - even with less than 700 miles to Katahdin. 
We are definitely in New England now. Salisbury has that classic New England feel - white picket fences, white churches with steeples, and graveyards with tombstones so old and weathered that you can no longer read many of them. Many of the tombstones in the graveyard next to Vanessa's have flags and plaques marking the graves of soldiers from the Revolutionary War and the French and Indian War. 
My friend Sue Miltenberger, who apparently is the only one who has been able to convince the TrailJournals captcha application that she is not a robot, posted a question on my Guestbook page about what I carry in my pack, so here goes: 
For shelter, I carry a 20 degree down quilt and a silk sleeping bag liner, an inflatable pillow, inflatable sleeping pad, small ground cloth, the Jacks R Better Bear Mountain Bridge hammock and a 10' x 11' silnylon tarp. 
For clothing, I wear the kilt, a wool shirt, wool boxer briefs, Tilley nylon hat, watch, wool socks, synthetic sock liners, gaiters, and Keen Targhee II boots. I carry a pair of nylon pants with zip off legs, extra wool socks and liners, a synthetic tee shirt, synthetic boxer briefs, a synthetic puffy jacket, light wool long john top, Vivobarefoot camp shoes and Goretex rain jacket. 
For cooking, I carry a Pepsi can alcohol stove, 900 mL titanium pot, insulated plastic cup, 10 oz plastic bottle of denatured alcohol, titanium windscreen, anodized aluminum spork, and Bic lighter. In addition, I carry two 1 liter Smartwater bottles, and a Sawyer Squeeze water filter and squeeze bag. I also have a food bag with 3 - 4 days' to worth of food. 
I carry a toiletries bag with toilet paper, trowel, wet wipes, and alcohol gel. Another toiletries bag has toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, Dr Bronner's soap, nitrile gloves, Desitin cream, and Gold Bond powder. 
In addition, I carry a small first aid kit, a small repair kit with duct tape and needle and thread, a head lamp, a small multi tool, SPOT tracker, wallet, two bandanas, small compass, small sitting pad, small thermometer, sunglasses, bug spray, headnet, iPhone, and raincover for my pack.
Finally, I carry an electronics bag that contains charger and cords for my iPhone, Mophie external battery, iPod Shuffle, headphones, and Kindle reader. 
What you carry in your pack is a result of personal choices and everyone's pack is different. You have to find that perfect balance of weight, cost, and comfort. Ultralight hikers are willing to sacrifice comfort (and sometimes safety) to carry less weight. Some hikers are doing this whole thing on a shoestring budget and have to carry heavier, less expensive gear. Some hikers like comfort and carry a lot of extraneous stuff. 
I've never weighed my pack, but suspect it's somewhere around 30 - 35 lbs with food and water. I am by no means an ultralight hiker; however, there are many people with much bigger packs than mine. I am always looking at what I have in my pack and comparing it to what others carry, trying to eliminate any weight without giving up too much comfort. The one cardinal rule out here is that you never mess with someone else's pack. What you choose to carry is your business. Sue - I hope that answers your question. If anyone else has questions or comments, you might try convincing the Guardian of the Guestbook again that you are not a robot. Some people seem to be getting through occasionally (at least I assume Sue isn't the only one left out there).

All of a sudden, when I awoke at Vanessa's place this morning, it was time to move on.  Although the last day and a half was just what I needed to heal my feet, Vanessa and her adult son are not the neatest people and the mess (such as last night's dinner still sitting on the kitchen counter) was all of a sudden too much. To make matters worse, 1st Sgt, J, and I shared our small room containing two sets of bunk beds with a young woman who, I would guess, has personal hygiene issues even when she is not thru hiking. As a result, our room smelled. Bad. 
Apparently, 1st Sgt and J felt the same. The three of us were packed and out the door by 6:30 AM. The only problem was that Sweet William's, the place we planned to have breakfast, didn't open until 7:00 AM. Luckily, there were outdoor tables at Sweet William's where we could hang out until they opened. 
After eating breakfast and hiking back to the trailhead, we were actually back on trail by 7:45 AM. It was a perfect hiking day - cool, sunny, and breezy. We were leaving town so, of course, we climbed. And climbed. We were almost out of CT and, I guess, CT wanted us to remember just how tough it was. So, it sent us up and over Bear Mountain. 
It actually wasn't too bad of a climb and, before long, we were over the top and down the other side and entering Massachusetts. Woo hoo! Of course, Massachusetts wanted to show us how tough it was and sent us over Mt Race AND Mt Everett. The climbing wasn't fun; but, it's nice to be back in actual mountains. The views from the Mt Race Ledges were incredible. And it's nice to once again have tumbling mountain streams rather than boggy, sluggish lake outflows. 
Hiking with J has been nice. He added a new element to our conversation. 1st Sgt and I have hiked together so long now that he just says' ""Joke number 7"" and I reply, ""Ha, ha, ha! Thats a good one!"" We found out all about J's family, career, hobbies, etc. it's funny - he started his hike on February 26 and we have crossed paths several times; but, this is the first time we've actually hiked together. 
Today's hike was fairly short - just 12.7 miles. We have now entered the Berkshires. This area is a very popular hiking area and has been loved to death. As a result, the ATC is trying to reduce overuse and only allows camping at designated campsites (they appear to be pretty serious about it - we saw two ridgerunners patrolling the area). So, we could either hike 12.7 miles today or 27.1 miles. We chose the former. With both 1st Sgt and I experiencing foot issues, the shorter hike was the better option. 
My feet are doing 1000x times better than when I hobbled into Salisbury two days ago. They are still pretty tender; but, the swelling is about gone. I'm hoping wet feet from the next two days of rain don't undo everything. 
We had a pleasant afternoon and evening at the shelter, visiting with other hikers and Ridgerunner Sarah. I am now comfortably ensconced in my hammock and ready to sleep. All in all, our first day in Massachusetts was great!","Salisbury, CT

We lucked out today. The forecasted thunderstorms went north of us. We had high humidity and a couple of sprinkles; but, no real rain. Although we had a couple of big climbs, today's hike was pretty good. 
1st Sgt, J, and I were on the trail by 6:30 AM and 1st Sgt set a pretty brisk pace. The morning passed pretty quickly and it wasn't long until we reached Rt 7. The AWOL guide said that the antique store near the trail crossing had a soda machine, so we headed over there only to find that the store was closed. Bummer. It's kind of funny - once you get your mind set on something like a soda, you become obsessed. We checked around a couple of other businesses nearby to no avail. 
Three sad little hikers returned to the trail, only to find that about a mile north a former thru hiker, Belch, and his friend were doing trail magic! Score! Mt Dew, Pepsi, watermelon, chocolate, and cheese and crackers. We were now very happy hikers and the sugar buzz carried us to the top of the nearby mountain. 
1st Sgt and I stopped at an overlook for lunch; however, J decided to keep on hiking because he said our pace was a little fast for him and he wanted to build up a little buffer. While eating lunch, we met Pom Pom and Deep Cheeks. They said that they had been treated to dinner and a place to stay in Great Barrington by a guy who was following me and 1st Sgt on TrailJournals. Way to go Kevin! You made their day!
After lunch, we settled in for the eight mile hike to the shelter. We hiked along, doing lots of ups and downs. About three miles before the shelter, I hit the wall. No energy! I struggled up the climb and finally caught up to 1st Sgt to find that he also owas struggling on the climbs. 
We eventually drug ourselves into the shelter, where we saw Monkey, whom we hadn't seen since NC, and No Hurry, who is averaging 3 - 5 miles a day. However, there was no J. The only thing we can figure is that he got off at the last road crossing and headed into town. 
We are both staying in the shelter tonight because we are expecting rain. Luckily, this shelter has four bunks (actually just wooden platforms), so we aren't sleeping on the floor. We are tired and our feet are also tired; but, our feet are actually doing better. Talking to other thru hikers, it appears that all our bodies are beginning to break down. Luckily, only 650 miles to Katahdin and I hear it's all downhill!","Glen Brook Shelter, MA

Today was one of those near-perfect days on the trail that you imagine when you are planning your trip. It didn't start out that way, though. 
It rained all night and we awoke to a steady rain. So, we ended up sleeping in a little, waiting for it to quit. As a result, it was almost 8:00 AM before we got on-trail. The rain had quit; but, the woods were all drippy. The humidity was so high that my glasses steamed and my shirt soaked through with sweat in a matter of minutes. As is typical on these days, little red efts were everywhere. 
As we hiked along, we heard this sound like wind coming up the mountain. Only it wasn't wind - it was a sheet of water. We took refuge under a pine tree and waited for the deluge to pass. Luckily, just as the tree was getting saturated, the rain let up. It was the last gasp of the storm, though. 
As we hiked, the clouds began to break up and the sun came out. Even better, a gentle but steady breeze began to blow. It was heavenly. Not only did it help cool and dry us out, it also helped keep the mosquitoes at bay. Eventually, it even helped push the humidity down. 
We were making for the Upper Goose Pond Cabin today. We have heard about this place from every southbound hiker we've seen the past few days. It's a cabin owned by the National Park Service and managed by the Appalachian Mountain Club. It has bunks with mattresses, canoes you can take out on the lake, and a dock which is perfect for swimming from. Not only that, the caretaker makes pancakes for breakfast! 
Before we reached the cabin though, we were going to pass another place we'd been hearing about lately. At the Jerusalem Rd trail crossing was the Running Spring Farm. The farm, which is actually a family home, had a small stand by the road that sells fresh and hard boiled chicken and goose eggs, sodas, chips, candy, cookies, and pop tarts. Not only that, they have a charging station for portable electronics. The stand is run by a brother and sister, ages 12 and 14. They raise the chickens and geese and buy and stock everything they sell in the stand. It made for a perfect lunch stop. 
The rest of the day was spent hiking under clear skies, low humidity, and gentle cooling breezes. We had a couple of pretty decent climbs; but, being Brave & Fierce thru hikers, they weren't a problem for us. It was no time at all until we arrived at the Upper Goose Pond Road, where we came upon trail magic! 
My friend Sauce had texted me last night and said that she and Snooze were taking a zero day because their parents were visiting. They wanted to know where we would be hiking because they wanted to put out trail magic and wanted it to be where we would pass it. Woo hoo! More soda, cookies, and chocolate. Not only that, but two former thru hikers, Shatterproof and Weeble, were at the same road giving out fruit. Score!
We eventually arrived at the cabin and it was  everything advertised - bunks, swimming, canoes, and a nice caretaker named Joanne. We had a very pleasant evening swimming, eating dinner, and visiting with other hikers. 
Even the wildlife got into the act today. We saw our second black bear. It was a small bear and it scampered off into the brush as soon as it saw us. We were careful to check around and make sure Momma bear wasn't lurking somewhere nearby, ready to jump on us for scaring her baby. Then, when we got to the cabin, we saw the resident baby porcupine hanging around the picnic table.  It was the first one I've ever seen in the wild. How cool!
All of these cool things came at just the right time. I was in need of a special day on the trail. Lately, the trail has been feeling a bit mundane. The other day, 1st Sgt said to me, ""You know, the pleats on your kilt aren't as crisp as they used to be."" If you ignore the disturbing fact that 1st Sgt noticed the pleats on my kilt or, even more, the fact that he felt compelled to comment on them, his comment was actually a pretty good metaphor for where my hike has been lately.
When I first started, the very act of walking in the woods was new, exciting, and liberating. I no longer cared about being able to differentiate syndiotactic and Isotactic phases of polypropylene by infrared spectroscopy. It was cool that I was walking in the woods on a Wednesday morning while everyone else was at work. 
Lately, walking in the woods is how we get from Point A to Point B. We've seen the rocks. We've seen the trees. We've seen the views. And most days, I don't even know what day it is. Our clothes all have holes. Our backpacks smell bad. Our feet hurt and our pleats aren't as crisp. Excitement now is a roadside stand that sells Mt Dew. 
Most everyone I talk to that started in Georgia feels the same, it seems. One man even told his wife, when she suggested coming for a visit, that it was probably best if she didn't because he would most likely end up going home with her. The Flip Floppers who started in Harpers Ferry haven't become as jaded yet. That's why I like hiking with them so much. 
Humans are such funny creatures. After awhile, even the most wondrous things become mundane. I imagine that the astronauts on the space station are excited to come home at the end of their tour. Don't worry. I'm not thinking about quitting. I'm not depressed. And I'm not having some sort of crisis. I'm just sort of telling you where my hike is right now.
 As we move further north, the woods are beginning to change. The hardwoods are being replaced more and more by conifers. We are seeing more ponds. And we are seeing strange and wondrous creatures like porcupines.
 Soon we'll be moving into the White Mountains and Maine. Although everyone says the last section of the hike is the hardest, they also say that it is the most beautiful. I'm also hearing wonderful things about Vermont from Lumber Jill, who is about a week ahead of me. I'm hoping the change in scenery helps bring back the wonder. Plus, I've never seen a moose. I hope I see a moose!","South Mt Wilcox Shelter, MA

Today was a good day on the trail. 20.6 miles of fairly flat trail, with only one big climb. After a restful night at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin, we were served blueberry pancakes by the caretaker. We were a little later than usual getting on the trail, since she could only cook a few pancakes at a time. We didn't mind waiting though. Our friend Squire and his two sons Stretch and Remix (14 and 12 years old) arrived at the cabin late last night after putting in a 25 mile day. It was nice to visit with them over breakfast this morning. 
Due to our late start and planned mileage, we moved it out and kept up a decent pace all day. We passed the October Mt Shelter at 8.8 miles into the hike and found a smoldering campfire left by last night's occupants. We did our civic duty and made sure the campfire was completely extinguished before leaving a note in the shelter register reminding people to make sure their fires were completely out and heading on down the trail. 
At 10.8 miles, we stopped at the home of the Cookie Lady. She is another trail icon. She and her husband have been feeding cookies to thru hikers for the past 30 years. They also sell sodas and ice cream, so we had to be sociable and buy something to eat while we visited. 
Then we were off again, fueled by soda and ice cream. The trail profile was pretty flat; but, the treadway was fairly rocky and rooty. Also, we passed through many marshy areas near beaver ponds that required walking on plank bridges. I still can't get used the lakes being on top of mountains. I expect them to be in the valleys and low areas. The marshy areas also meant bugs. Lots of bugs. I almost broke out the DEET for the first time. 
At about mile 14 we came upon Rob Byrd and his friend Nancy handing out trail magic from his van. More soda and cookies to fuel our final push into Dalton. By the last few miles, our feet were getting tired; but, we kept up the pace. As usual, the last mile of the hike seemed to take forever; but, eventually, we arrived in Dalton. To celebrate our successful hike, we stopped at Sweet Peas for some ice cream. One nice thing about hiking 20 miles a day is you can pretty much eat what you want. 
We then made our way to the Shamrock Inn, where we had reserved a room. We were met by none other than Rob Byrd who offered to drive us over to Pittsfield for dinner since all the restaurants in tiny Dalton were already closed for the evening. The meal was wonderful and Rob was a very interesting fellow. After dinner, he brought us back to the motel. And who should arrive shortly thereafter but none other than Squire and the Boys. They put in another long day and are now rooming next to us in the motel. Tomorrow, laundry and resupply before we begin our assault on Massachusetts' tallest peak - Mt Greylock!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin, MA

An opportunity presented itself to allow me to make a quick trip to TN, so I am off trail for a few days. Squire, Remix, and Stretch are heading to Johnson City, TN, because Squire's grandfather, who has been sick for an extended period, has been placed in hospice care. They graciously offered to give me a ride to Johnson City, where I will make arrangements to get to Knoxville. 
I think a few days off the trail will allow my feet to finish healing and allow me to see Marguerite and the dogs, which will help recharge my batteries. I also want to make a few equipment changes while I'm home. 
It will also solve another dilemma that was looming. 1st Sgt's wife is coming to visit her family in upstate NY for eight days. 1st Sgt has been planning to take some days off to spend time with her, which would have put me a few days ahead of him. We want to go through the Whites and the 100 Mile Wilderness and, ultimately, summit Katahdin together. 
This way, he can hike ahead a few days and, when I come back, I can catch up while he visits his wife. Sitting Bull, Hoops, Ramsey, and Hummingbird (who finally caught up) are on their way to Boston for a few days. Shenaniguy, Pluck, and Silly Spilly are taking a couple zero days. And Good Life is almost in CT. Hopefully, Squire and the boys are back on trail soon. I suspect we are all going to meet up some where in northern VT. It's cool how everything works out on the trail. Of course, Darwin & Company, and my good friend Lumber Jill, continue heading north, pretty much assuring that we won't see them again. I've asked her to send me a Katahdin Summit picture. 
In another example of ""the trail provides"", I was supposed to visit the sister of a high school friend on Wednesday when I crossed into VT. I called her and told her of my change in plans and wanted to know if I could stop by next week instead. It turns out that my high school friend, Linda, will be visiting her sister next week. In the end, they are going to pick me up at the Albany airport on Monday, put me up for the night, and return me to the trail. Boom!
Laura, the owner of the Shamrock Inn, was kind enough to drive us to the Enterprise Rent a Car office, where we picked up a car and headed south. We had an enjoyable drive, comparing notes on people we've met on the trail, hostels we've stayed in, and parts of the trail we've found most challenging.
Squire has been living abroad with his family on various military assignments the past several years. He recently retired and is using this opportunity to show his boys what America looks like. Squire is the kind of upstanding, competent person you want in charge of the military. His boys are the great kind of kids we all want our children to be. 
Speaking of kids, we drove for about six hours and ironically got a room for the night in a motel in Martinsburg, WV, across the street from my son, Sam's, apartment. Unfortunately, he is working a shift on the ambulance tonight and won't be off work until 7:00 AM. We have to be on the road no later than 8:00 AM so I can catch the 2:25 pm bus to Knoxville. We might be able to wave at him as we get on the road...
I'm excited to go home for a few days. I think that returning to the trail with a goal to catch up with 1st Sgt will take care of the mundanity I've been experiencing on the trail the past few days. Meanwhile, I'm getting a chance to make new trail friends in Squire, Stretch, and Remix. And, as an added bonus, I get to ride on I-81 yet again!","Shamrock Inn, Dalton, MA

After a fairly short night at the Knights Inn, we were up and ready to hit the road by 7:00 AM. As we were pumping gas, my son Sam texted that he was leaving work. So, we met him at the Dunkin Donuts. It was fun to at least have a short visit with him. 
The rest of the morning was spent riding down I-81, which essentially parallels the AT through Virginia. So, it was fun to share stories that happened at various places along the AT we passed as we headed back south. Squire and the boys are such easy companions the ride all the way from Massachusetts to Tennessee actually passed very quickly. Squire and I even discovered that we have very similar tastes in music. 
We were under a bit of a time constraint to get to Johnson City, TN, for me to catch the 2:25 PM bus to Knoxville. We knew we were OK when we passed the bus on I-81 near Wytheville. We stopped for a quick rest area break and were a bit concerned that it may have passed us back up; but, we were good. We reached Johnson City about 1:45 PM. The bus didn't arrive until 2:55 PM. A short and uneventful bus ride brought me to Knoxville. Then, a quick Uber ride and I was home. 
I am happy to be home once again with Marguerite and the dogs. She already has a honey do list started for me and I have to do a few things like replace broken or lost equipment and find new shoes. I imagine the time at home will pass pretty quickly. 
I was a bit unhappy about one thing today, though. I read 1st Sgt's TrailJournals blog and discovered he saw a bear yesterday! He's not supposed to be having bear sightings without me!","Martinsburg, WV

I enjoyed my zero day at home. I took care of a few items on the honey do list. I also shopped for new shoes. I started my hike in  trailrunners; but, switched to Keen boots through the Pennsylvania rocks. Now mm they are heavy on my feet. I also think that they contributed to my foot issues because they are very warm, resulting in perpetually sweaty feet. 
I went to my local REI and tried on various trailrunners. I loaded down a pack with 30 lbs of weight and walked around the store trying out various models of shoes. I finally settled on the Brooks Caldera shoes, size 14. I also replaced some broken and lost equipment. 
Tomorrow - a few more honey dos and a pack shake down to eliminate as much weight as possible before I return to the trail.","Knoxville, TN

In case you're wondering, today's picture had nothing like o do with the post. Honey-do list chores continue during my zero days. I had a funny thing happen. We have a detached garage that sits about 20 feet behind the house. The garage door has an ancient Sears garage door opener. When we moved in, the previous owners left only one ancient remote control for the opener. 
We had to end up replacing the receiver on the garage door opener and got enough remotes to put one in each car and one in the kitchen so we can open the door from in the house. Despite its advanced age, the garage door opener has worked fine until I went to open the door yesterday and it would only go up a foot before going back down. 
I went to investigate and took the garage door remote with me. To make a long story short, we had a broken spring on the door. I had to release the door from the opener and get the neighbor kids to help me push up the 15 ft wide wooden door that weighed a ton so Marguerite could get the car out of the garage to go to work. 
In the end, we were able to get a garage door repair company to come and fix it. During all the excitement, however, I managed to set the garage door remote down somewhere. I looked all over the garage and all over the house to no avail. No garage door remote anywhere. Marguerite came home from teaching chemistry lab and helped me look. No remote. 
At this point, I was beginning to get a sick feeling that I may have set the remote down on one of the cars while trying to get the door open. It was not on either car, so I figured it had probably sat on the car as one of us drove off until it went around a sharp turn somewhere and the remote flew off. 
This morning when we walked the dogs, I looked along the road and in the ditches. No remote. We finally decided that the thing was gone for good. 
Marguerite and I had also been talking about how we need to replace our ugly mailbox with a newer, prettier mailbox. I was running to Lowe's later and decided to figure out what I'd need to replace the mailbox and post upon which it sits. Unfortunately, we have two yucca plants planted at the base of the post. So, I was examining the yuccas to see how I was going to dig a new post hole without getting stabbed to death. And what do I find down in the yucca? The remote of course! Well, at least part of it. The cover was missing. 
I went digging down in the yucca for the cover which, of you've ever dealt with a yucca you'd know, is a very painful endeavor. Those leaves are sharp!  I eventually found the cover and was able to put the remote back together. 
Examining the remote, it appears that I indeed did place the remote on one of the cars during the door crisis. Whenever the car backed out of the driveway and turned onto the street, the remote tumbled off into the street. The beaten up appearance of the remote body suggests that a vehicle then ran it over. It must not have been a direct hit since the remote wasn't crushed. Instead, it must have been a glancing blow that sent it shooting into the yucca, where it awaited discovery by me. 
Upon reassembly and testing, I was amazed to find that the remote still worked! The remote has been returned to its rightful spot with only a few chips and scratches to commemorate the Grand Remote Caper. Nothing like this ever happens out on the trail...","Knoxville, TN

So, I got this idea from No Rush. He said that when he had to go off trail for Lyme Disease treatment he painted a white blaze on a tree in his yard to remind him of the trail.

Heading back to the trail after a very nice visit home. I finished several Honey-do projects and enjoyed spending time with Marguerite. We also had an overnight visit from our niece Lisa Rine, her husband GARY RINE, their son Daniel and his fiancé Joely as they were passing through town on their way to GA.  Oh yeah, and let's not forget Winnie the golden retriever!
Today I flew back to Albany, NY, via Baltimore and Philadelphia. All three legs of the trip were uneventful. It was a very quiet travel day and all the airports were almost empty. 
I was met at the airport by my high school friend Linda MacPeak Townley, her sister Kathy Foley, and her niece Heather. A short drive brought us to Kathy's home, where I met her husband Jim and their menagerie of dogs, cats, horses, goats, and chickens. Being the animal lover that I am, I was in heaven. 
We went to dinner at a local pizza place in nearby Bennington, VT, and then got the nickel tour of covered bridges and monuments in Bennington. The rest of the evening was spent visiting and filling in our lives since we'd last seen one another over 30 years ago. 
Tomorrow, I return to Dalton, MA, and continue my northward migration with a hike up and over Mt Greylock, Massachusetts' highest peak.

After a great breakfast of farm fresh eggs, bacon, and French toast, Linda and Kathy returned me to the Shamrock Inn in Dalton. I wanted to check in with Laura at the Shamrock and let her know I was back on the trail; but, she wasn't around. 
I hiked through town and headed back into the woods. It was a beautiful morning with crystal clear skies and temperatures in the 60s. The trail was pretty nice, with some rocks and muddy patches, but not too bad. After leaving town, I immediately started climbing up Cheshire Cobble. ""Up"" would prove to be the word of the day, as I would spend most of the day climbing up Mt Greylock. 
Before starting up Mt Greylock, though, I dropped down the back side of Cheshire Cobble into the town of Cheshire, MA. I happened to walk right past an ice cream/sandwich shop at noon. So, naturally, I stopped for a ham and Swiss on rye and a chocolate shake. 
With my stomach full of town food and my pack full of restocked supplies, it was time to climb a mountain. At 3489 ft, this mountain was the highest mountain in Massachusetts. Cheshire sits at 970 ft. So, I had to climb 2519 ft over 7.4 miles. Definitely not the worst climb we've done out here; but, it just went on for a long time. 
Since it was a holiday, and beautiful weather to boot, there were a ton of people on the trail. They were mostly day hikers; however, I also saw quite a few thru hikers. In fact, the first person I saw on the trail today was a thru hiker named Calves that I had last seen in PA. He had had several issues, including shin splints and a stress fracture in his foot, that had slowed him down for awhile. He came flying past me, almost running, slowing down just long enough to catch up on what we'd both been up to. He then roared off into the distance. Had he slowed down long enough, I may have been able to give him a hint as to why he was having so many medical issues. 
After climbing all afternoon, I arrived at the summit of Mt Greylock. The summit has a tower that is a war memorial to MA veterans. It looks kind of like a swooping light house. Mt Greylock also has the Bascom Lodge, which has a bunkroom where hikers can stay. I probably should have pushed on to the next shelter, but I decided to get a bunk for the night so I can hopefully see the fireworks from Adams, MA, which sits at the base of Mt Greylock. They should be just about at our eye level. 
The next three days will be 20+ milers as I try to catch back up with 1st Sgt and the rest of my trail friends. I think the week off was just what I needed. My feet are all healed up and appear to be working just fine in my trail runners. Also, I really enjoyed being back in the woods. Tomorrow - Vermont!","Shamrock Inn, Dalton, MA

Today was a beautiful day for hiking. Once again, clear blue skies and highs in the upper 70s. Bascom Lodge offered a ""continental breakfast"" as part of the lodging package; however, some section hikers that I ate dinner with informed me that the breakfast was actually a single muffin and they didn't start serving until 8:00 AM. I wanted to get an earlier start, so I ate my own breakfast from my food bag and headed out before 7:00 AM. 
I hiked down off of Mt Greylock to Williamstown, MA, where I had second breakfast at the Stop N Shop. It was located about 0.5 miles off-trail. I typically won't go that far off-trail for waterfalls and overlooks unless they are spectacular; however, I'll gladly do it for second breakfast. I'm going to miss second breakfast when I am done hiking and start eating like a normal person again.  
I texted with Wizard and Shenaniguy and found out that Wizard and Pluck are only 2 days ahead of me and Shenaniguy is off-trail with an injury. I'm bummed to hear about Shenaniguy; but, I'm excited that I am gaining on Wizard and Pluck. Also, I believe that Sitting Bull, Hoops, Ramsey, and Hummingbird are only about three days ahead. Unfortunately, 1st Sgt has been putting in the miles slackpacking while his wife is here, so it's going to take me awhile to catch him. 
I am also beginning to meet a bunch of thru hikers that have been traveling about a week behind us since Georgia. It's kind of funny to think that while I've been hiking with my little group of people all these months there are all these other groups of people all around us. 
The highlight of the day was knocking down another state. I crossed into Vermont just after noon. The nickname for Vermont on the AT is ""Vermud"". Almost as soon as I crossed the border, it became obvious where this nickname came from. I started hitting big patches of thick, squishy, black mud that stretched across the trail, making it impossible to go around. The trail maintainers have done a yoeman's job placing stepping stones in many of the worst patches. 
""Stepping stones"" is actually a misnomer. Most of the stones are boulders. Think about it - many of these mud holes are miles from a trailhead. So, the trail crews have to carry in any tools they need to place these rocks. And they aren't using power tools. So, most of these rocks are being placed using brute force. 
The dedication of the trail maintainers is humbling. I always go out of my way to thank them for all their hard work when I see them. Hopefully, I can do my part when I finish hiking and return home.
Of course, there are plenty of mud holes that have not been bridged with stones or logs. As a result, my bright new trail runners, along with the socks in them, and the feet in those, are covered with black mud. Yuck!
The Long Trail, which is a 279 mile trail that traverses VT (and, incidentally, was the inspiration for the AT), runs concurrently with the AT for 105 miles starting at the MA/VT border. As a result, we are seeing more people on the trail since we've added LT hikers to the NOBO, SOBO, Flip flopper, section hiker mix. All of these hikers appeared to be heading for the Congdon Shelter for the night. 
I had originally planned to stop there also; however, I wasn't too impressed with the shelter. It was old, right on top of a creek (mosquitoes), had no picnic table, no phone reception, and the tent sites were rocky. So, I decided to keep moving to the top of Harmon Hill. I had read in the guide about a small tent site on the summit. 
When I arrived at the site, of course, there was already a tent there. Bummer - apparently, I'm not the only one who reads the trail guides. Luckily, I found a spot for my tent nearby. Blue Steel, the occupant of the other tent, and I fixed dinner together and watched a gorgeous sunset over Bennington, VT. 
I am now in my tent. A stiff breeze is blowing the stars around and a bright moon is lighting up my tent. Hopefully, I can get some sleep tonight. At least the stiff breeze will hopefully dry out my muddy shoes.","Bascom Lodge, Mt Greylock, MA

A long day hiking today - 25.8 miles. I am heading into Manchester Center, VT tomorrow and wanted to get extra miles in today to make tomorrow's hike shorter, thus maximizing the time in town for resupply, etc. 
The mud continues unabated. I got up close and personal with it today when I was crossing a particularly wet and mucky patch. Both feet slipped as I stepped between two rocks in the middle of the mud patch and I plopped my butt right down into it. All you can do at that point is jump up (sinking both feet up to the ankles), look around to see if anyone saw, and brush yourself off the best you can. Luckily, I will get to do laundry today. 
The trail continues to be pretty crowded. I stopped for lunch at a shelter and there were 15 of us eating lunch. I hiked briefly with a young Scotsman from Edinburgh. He thought my kilt was pretty cool. His parents are coming to visit in a few days and bringing his kilt for him to wear as he summits Mt Katahdin. Although he didn't mean anything by it, he did point out that he would be wearing a ""proper"" kilt. I assured him that I realized my kilt wasn't ""proper"" since it wasn't wool and it wasn't a true tartan; but, it was durable, comfortable, lightweight, and quick drying. 
I actually saw a familiar face today. I ran into Grace Note. We had hiked with her a couple days in CT. She is moving a bit slower, so I caught back up. I'm still looking forward to catching back up with my people. In fact, Pluck texted me yesterday wanting to know where 1st Sgt and I were because she missed her trail family. She and Wizard are still a day and a half ahead of me; but, I'm gaining in them. 
I start off tomorrow with a 2000 ft climb up and over Mt Stratton, then cruise another 13 miles into town. Hopefully, the predicted rain holds off. Rain will only make the mud that much worse...","Stealth site on Harmon Hill, VT

There wasn't much not to like about today's hike. I was up and on the trail by 6:15 AM. The skies were overcast; but, the forecasted rains had held off. In fact, the sun ended up breaking out by the afternoon. 
I started the morning with a 1500 ft climb over 2.3 miles to the top of 3936 ft Stratton Mt. Then it was a 13.8 mile downhill coast into Manchester Center. The climb to the top of the mountain turned out to be fairly easy. There was a fire tower at the summit; however, the summit was in the clouds. So I didn't bother climbing the tower since there was no view to be had. 
On the descent, I passed the young Scotsman, Juggernaut, as he was packing up his stealth camp. As is always the case with the young guys, he blew past me on a matter minutes. It's always a little disheartening when you think you are just flying down the trail and these young guys pass you like you're standing still. 
It wasn't too long until I came upon Juggernaut standing on the trail, drinking a soda, talking to a man and a woman. As I approached, the woman said, ""Beaker! We were wondering when you'd get here!""  
It turns out that Mudpuppy (the wife) and Woodcutter (the husband) are 1999 thru hikers who have been following me on TrailJournals. They had driven two and a half hours from Albany just to meet up with me on the trail. Incredible! They plied me with vast quantities of food and drink - all of which I gladly devoured while we discussed the history of kilts with Juggernaut. During our discussion, I also learned that Mudpuppy and Woodcutter had driven over to see 1st Sgt a few days ago also. 
After a short visit, I headed out again because I needed to get to Manchester Center in time to eat town food and resupply at the grocery store before calling for Jeff from Green Mountain Hostel to pick me up in town before 7 pm. The problem was that the trail didn't go through town, so I would have to thumb a ride into town, which, unless you happen to be hiking with a young woman, can take awhile. 
I continued roaring down the trail all hopped in on sugar, making great time until just before reaching the road, when the trail decided to climb a bit. Not a big problem, just irritating when you want to get to town. Eventually, I reached the road. My plan was to try hitchhiking while wearing the kilt rather than changing into my town pants since the last time 1st Sgt and I tried to hitch and I was wearing my pants, no one picked us up. I figured that maybe someone would want to pick up an ""interesting character"" to hear cool trail stories. 
When I got to the road, I found that all my planning was unnecessary because there were Mudpuppy and Woodcutter waiting to give me a ride to town! Wow! These guys were really something. They drove me to town and gave me the quick scenic tour before dropping me off at the outfitter's store and heading back to Albany. Now, that's what I consider trail magic - they mad my day so much easier. 
I was able to accomplish my mission of eating lots of town food and resupplying before Jeff picked me and Blue Steel up to go to the hostel. The Green Mountain Hostel rates up there as one of the best I've stayed in on the whole trail. It is immaculate and Jeff is very friendly and accommodating. Plus, he sells pints of Ben & Jerry's ice cream for $2.00. Incredible! 
I am here with six other hikers - some AT hikers and some Long Trail hikers. I am clean and dry, my clothes are clean and dry, and I am well fed. I'm ready to head out in the morning to continue chasing after the siren song of Mt Katahdin. Of course, it's supposed to rain tomorrow. Bummer.","IP Road stealth site, VT

The Green Mountain House was definitely one of the best hostels I've stayed in on this trip. This morning I had an egg muffin sandwich and a bowl of Lucky Charms. There were supplies for pancakes; but, I just wasn't up for cooking. 
Jeff, the proprietor, then shuttled us back to the trail. Before we left, he gave the standard  ""Does everyone have everything?"" speech. I laughed and said, ""You sound like you give that speech a lot."" He assured me I'd be amazed at how many grown adults go off and leave things behind. By now, you can guess where this is going...
We got to the trail head and, sure enough, I did not have my phone! Luckily, Jeff had to do a second run since he couldn't take us all in one load. I road back down the mountain and retrieved my phone and my hat. I had set them down on the porch when I was putting on my hiking shoes. 
I was finally on the trail by 8:30 AM. It looked like the predicted rain was holding off at least for awhile; however, it was foggy and blustery - a real kilt flapper. Being a post-town day, I had to deal with the three Fs:Full food bag, Food baby in my belly, and Freakin' big climb. This time, the Freakin' big climb was 3268 ft Bromley Mountain. 
When I reached the top of Bromley Mt I found myself on a ski slope, complete with warming hut and ski lift. The fog and wind still persisted. How does that even work? Fog AND high winds? Once we topped Bromley Mountain, the rest of the day was spent generally descending. Of course, it finally did decide to rain and I spent the rest of the morning either hiking in rain or getting dripped  on by wet trees. 
Whereas yesterday the only other hiker I saw on the trail was Juggernaught, today I was surrounded by hikers. I spent time hiking with Hangman and Baby Monster, Bearslayer and Yogi, and with Blue Steel. 
There were ten of us for lunch at Peru Peak Shelter. I headed out and had hiked about a mile when I realized that my head felt very airy. I had left my hat at the shelter! Today, I definitely had the Forgetsies! I turned around and headed back. I had only gone a short way when Hangman and Baby Monster hiked up with my hat. Yay!
At the next shelter, I came across another familiar face - English Detective. I hadn't seen him since the beginning of Massachusetts. It's always fun to see a hiker I haven't seen in awhile. 
By mid-afternoon, the skies had cleared and the sun was out in full force. It was nice to dry out a little as Blue Steel and I hiked on to Little Rock Pond Shelter, where we planned to spend the night. This shelter is a heavily used shelter, especially on the weekends. The Green Mountain Club actually stations a caretaker at this shelter and charges $5 to spend the night. 
Less than a mile from the shelter, the skies suddenly got so dark that I thought maybe 1st Sgt's much vaunted solar eclipse had arrived early. The winds started to pick up and then I heard it - a far off hissing sound that soon evolved into the sound of rain on tree leaves. Heavy rain. In a matter of moments, I was soaked to the skin. Really!? The rain couldn't hold off thirty more minutes until I reached the shelter? Of course, by the time I reached the shelter the sun was back out. 
The trees were still dripping (as was I) and the ground was wet, so I decided to stay in the shelter rather than get my tent wet. Luckily, there was an open area since most people were tenting. I am now dry, fed, and in my bed for the night. Gee, I can't wait to put wet clothes on on the morning...","Green Mountain Hostel, Manchester Center, VT

So, I gave in to peer pressure today. I had to do what the cool kids were doing. My wife, Marguerite, would probably say that I got led astray by a pretty young woman, as usual. 
I awoke to a beautiful day on Little Rock Pond. Little Rock Pond is the quintessential New England pond. The rest of us would call it a lake; but, New Englanders like to call their lakes ponds. The sun was rising over the ridge behind the lake and shining through the gently swirling mist. The water was lapping against the shore and the pines were gently swaying in the light breeze. Then I heard it - the sound I had looked forward to hearing before I ever started this hike - loons! What a unique and evocative sound. Although I'd never heard one in person before today, it's a sound I always associate with New England (""Look, Norman, the loons!""). 
After spending some time just soaking in the whole pond scene, I headed out on a 19.7 mile hike to Governor Clement Shelter. There were several thru hikers on the trail again today. I spent most of the day hiking around Blue Steel, a 30-something guy I've been hiking around the past few days, and a nice couple in their 30s named Lighthouse (her) and Ninja (him) that I've seen on and off the past couple of days. 
I say ""hiking around"" because it's not quite like hiking with 1st Sgt, where we would hike together and have sparkling conversation (e.g., Ginger vs Marianne). In this case, I was hiking by myself; but, close enough to the others that we would cross paths often and exchange a bit of conversation. It was just sort enough to remind you that you weren't alone in the woods. 
Speaking of hiking alone, I finally broke down and listened to music while hiking today. Always before, I've had conversation with 1st Sgt to help pass the day while walking. And walking. And walking. By this afternoon, I was tired of the silence and put in one ear bud and listened to music while keeping the other ear open to listen to what was around me. I'm always amazed by hikers who wear both ear buds and are startled when you walk up behind them. It is always important to maintain a certain level of situational awareness. 
The woods are beginning to slowly change. More pine trees, fewer hardwoods. More ferns and less poison ivy and Virginia Creeper. Higher mountains and rushing streams. I am even beginning to see moose droppings! We still have plenty of mud, though. 
We continued hiking up and down hills and over streams. The climb out of Clarendon Gorge proved to be especially long and steep. At one point, we passed a sign saying 500 miles to Mt Katahdin. On one had, that seems like a long way; but, on the other, it's beginning to seem almost attainable. 
Lighthouse and Ninja planned to continue past the Governor Clement Shelter to the Cooper Lodge Shelter. They encouraged me to continue with them. I told them I'd have to see how I felt after 19.7 miles.
 The Cooper Lodge Shelter was only 4.3 miles past Governor Clement; however, it was 4.3 miles of climbing to the top of Killington Mt. Killington is the first 4000 footer we've encountered since Virginia, so it was a long climb. Besides, it was looking like it might rain at any minute and I wasn't wanting a repeat of yesterday. 
I reached Governor Clement around 5:30 PM, just before Lighthouse and Ninja and took off my pack and sat down to rest. Blue Steel was already there and was also resting. Ninja and Lighthouse arrived shortly and said they were heading on. Lighthouse appeared a little disappointed to see me sitting with my pack off and asked if I was going on. I said I had to eat a snack first. To be quite honest, I was pretty tired from all the climbing we'd already done today. 
They headed out and Blue Steel picked up his pack and said he was heading on also. I looked around the shelter and decided it looked pretty dank and uninviting. Besides, the clouds were beginning to break up and a sunset at 4000+ feet would be pretty cool. 
So, I shouldered my pack, cranked up Mumford & Sons on my iPhone, and started climbing. Actually, I got my second wind and felt pretty good. I soon overtook Lighthouse and Ninja and they were happy to see me. I think they'd decided that I was staying behind. 
We climbed, and climbed, and climbed for the next 2.5 hours and finally reached the Cooper Lodge just before 8:00 PM. The Cooper Lodge is an old enclosed shelter that is actually in pretty bad shape; however, there are tenting platforms nearby. So, that's where I set up for the night. 
It is still a steep 0.2 mile climb to the summit from the lodge, so I did not end up going up to see the sunset. Blue Steel went up and said the view was amazing.
I'm now in my tent. It's pretty late and I'm pretty tired; but, I'm really glad I did the climb. I think I'll climb up to the summit for sunrise.","Little Rock Pond Shelter, VT

I climbed the steep 0.2 mile trail to the top of Killington Peak to see the sunrise. I'm glad I didn't try going up last night for the sunset. It was steep! After my long climb, the last 0.2 miles to the summit may have proven to be the straw that broke the camel's back. The sky was overcast, so the sunrise wasn't too spectacular; but, the view was incredible. It was definitely worth the climb. 
As a result of my little excursion, I didn't get on the trail until 8:45 AM. Ninja, Lighthouse, and Blue Steel were long gone. Even all the section hikers had packed up and headed out. That was alright, though, because I was only doing an 8.3 mile Nearo, mostly downhill, into Killington where I planned to resupply and spend the night at the Inn at the Long Trail, another AT icon. The Inn is home to McGrath's Irish Pub, which is sure to serve Magner's Irish Hard Cider. 
As I was hiking, I got a text from Sitting Bull wanting to know where I was. He and Hoops were just leaving Rutland, which is next to Killington, after having zeroed a couple days at the Yellow Deli Hostel. The Yellow Deli is run by the Twelve Tribes religious movement, although some regard them as a cult. I'll let you Google them and make your own decision; however, I felt an inn hosting an Irish pub was more my speed. 
I came to the point where the Long Trail and the AT diverge, with the Long Trail continuing north to Canada and the AT heading more easterly toward NH. And who should be sitting at the intersection but Hoops and Sitting Bull! I was so excited to see some of my people again. 
They accompanied me to to the Inn, where we had lunch in the pub. The food was as good as advertised and the atmosphere was great. After catching up on everything that had happened since we last saw one another and sharing trail gossip, I went to my room and took a much needed shower. 
I then caught the bus to Rutland to resupply and get my hiking poles repaired since I've worn through another set of tips. I was able to resupply; however, I struck out with the poles because the outfitter had gone out of business. 
Upon my return to the Inn, I found that Sitting Bull and Hoops had decided to stay and head out with me in the morning. Yay! The rest of the afternoon was taken up with chores, such as laundry and repackaging food. 
We had another outstanding meal at the pub and were waited on by the owner, Murray. What an interesting and gregarious fellow! I would highly recommend stopping in if you are ever in the area. 
I heard from 1st Sgt today. He has been crushing the miles and is almost 90 miles ahead of us. He is hiking with Pa John and Spaz and will be entering the White Mountains tomorrow. Unless he takes a bunch of zeros, I doubt we will catch back up with him. 
I also heard from Blood Mountain. He just crossed the halfway point in PA and is still chugging north. Typically, only about 1 in 5 hikers complete the trail. It's interesting to note that all five of us who stayed in the Blood Mt Cabins way back in Neel Gap, GA - me, Hoops, Blood Mt, Antman, and Alexa (now McFlurry) - are still on the trail. How cool is that!?
We will head out tomorrow after breakfast and are planning a 21.7 mile day. The Weather Channel is calling for a 100% chance of rain with heavy thunderstorms in the afternoon. It sounds like it might be a nice day to sit in an Irish pub and drink Magners...","Cooper Lodge, VT

When Sitting Bull, Hoops, and I went to the pub for dinner last night we ended up sitting at the bar because there was a large tour group taking up all the tables. While waiting for our food, we began discussing today's hike. There was a big gap between the shelters and we were trying to figure out where to stop for the night. 
The man sitting at the bar next to us heard our conversation and suggested we hike to VT 12, which was 21.6 miles away, and stay in Dan Quinn's barn. Dan's barn isn't listed in any of the guides; but, he lets hikers stay in the loft. 
The man at the bar was a local shuttler named Tom and was a friend of Dan's. He called Dan, who is out of town visiting a sick relative, and made arrangements for us to use the loft. Woo hoo! The forecast was for heavy rain all day, so a dry barn loft would be particularly nice. 
It rained all night and we awoke to a gray, blustery day. I had to wait until 7:30 AM for the restaurant to open for breakfast. Then, the service was a bit slow. As a result, I wasn't ready to hit the trail until 8:45 AM - another late start. 
Sitting Bull and Hoops were just coming to breakfast as I finished. We made plans to meet up at the barn and I headed out. On the 0.5 mile climb back to the AT (of course, those miles don't count) the rain stopped. Although it continued to be gray and drippy all morning, it was a vast improvement over what had been forecast.
The hike took me past Kent Pond, where I was almost carried off by an army of mosquitoes. Generally, I leave bugs alone because I am a visitor to their home; but, I hate mosquitoes and ticks and kill as many as I can of the vile, nasty creatures. I almost broke down and got out the DEET for the first time on this hike. I hate DEET almost as much as I hate mosquitoes. I knew that I had a big climb after Kent Pond, so I decided to wait and see of the mosquitoes abated as I climbed. 
After Kent Pond I passed a side trail that led into the town of Killington. I decided to make a quick detour to the outfitter's in Killington to see if they had replacement tips for my hiking poles. I have already worn through two sets of metal tips. I was in luck - they sold both hiking pole tips and Dove Ice Cream Bars. Now that's what I consider a good second breakfast.
I spent the rest of the morning climbing up and down the Vermont hills. We appear to finally have reached the end of the mud. I think that it missed the turn at Maine Junction, where the AT diverged from the Long Trail, and kept trucking on up the Long Trail. I just hope it doesn't realize its mistake and catch back up with us. Let the Long Trail hikers deal with it. 
Speaking of LT hikers, since the trails diverged the AT has once again gotten quiet. I didn't see any other northbound hikers on the trail today. I did see quite a few SOBOs though. They are less than 500 miles into their hikes and look all crisp and new. Although, they have already come through the 100 Mile Wilderness and the White Mts, so they must be pretty tough. 
After lunch, the sun began to peak out and the afternoon turned quite pleasant. I passed two crews from the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps doing trail maintenance. In each case, I thanked them for maintaining the trail for us. At one point, I came to a 14 ft aluminum ladder affixed to the rock face so we could climb down a 20 ft vertical drop. 
Since I knew that I'd be hiking most of the day by myself, I downloaded an audio book to help pass the time. It really did make the afternoon pass faster. Due to my late start and detour to Killington, it turned out to be a long afternoon of hiking nonetheless. At one point on top of a mountain, I turned off airplane mode on my phone to check messages. I had a text from Sitting Bull saying that they got an even later start than me and would not reach the barn. Bummer. 
I finally reached the barn around 7:30 PM. I'm the only one here tonight. The loft has a table and chairs and a pretty sketchy looking  bed. I decided to sleep on my air mattress on the floor. It also has various things like Christmas and Halloween decorations and a bunch of skis. Best of all, it has electricity and an old box fan. So, I can charge my phone and dry my clothes. All things considered , it's a pretty cool set up.","Inn at the Long Trail, Killimgron, VT

I survived my night alone in the barn loft. Apparently, it is not a haunted barn. There was a creepy doll hanging from the rafters; but, she didn't animate during the night and chase me around with a knife. She didn't even cry like a real baby. Either one of those would have made a really cool blog entry; but, alas, it was a quiet and restful night. 
I was up and on my way by 6:45 AM. I had another 20+ mile day planned to bring me to the VT-NH border. The day was beautiful and sunny. I started out with a steep climb away from VT 12. We have had a lot of ups and downs on the trail the past couple of days. At Maine Junction, where the AT diverged from the Long Trail, we turned East. So now, instead of running parallel to the ridges, we are running perpendicular to them. So, we go up, and down, and up, and down. 
At one point, the AT ran along an old forest road with mossy green stone walls on either side and huge old maple trees overhanging it. It put me in mind of headless horsemen (yeah, I know Sleepy Hollow was in NY) and Robert Frost poems. 
I am still enthralled by the feeling of History that pervades the New England section of the trail. I wonder about who stacked all the stones I see in the random walls I come across in the middle of the woods. What did the land look like when these walls were built? 
The AT runs right through Hanover, NH, and its counterpart across the Connecticut River, Norwich, VT. Hanover is home to the Ivy League school Dartmouth College. As a result, even though the towns are very hiker friendly, all the accommodations in the area come with Ivy League price tags, leaving nowhere for poor, smelly thru hikers to rest their weary heads and stinky feet. 
To counteract this problem, many residents of these fair cities have opened up their homes to thru hikers. Jeff at the Green Mountain House in Manchester Center provided me with a list of these trail angels when I stayed at his hostel. 
About 10 miles out from Hanover I started down the list, calling and leaving messages. I assume that most people were at work. I was beginning to get worried when I got a call back from Warren Thayer offering me a bed for the night. I was pleased because I had heard raves about Warren and his wife, Toni, from a SOBO hiker a couple of days ago. 
Warren's house was easy to find. It was the first one I came to after leaving the woods and entering Norwich. It was also the house with AT stickers all over the mailbox and a cooler full of trail magic at the end of the drive. This whole list was a toss of the dice, not knowing anything about the people or homes. Well, I rolled the dice pretty well, let me tell you!
This house, which is in a very up-scale neighborhood, would probably go for $750K - $1M. Warren works from home as a magazine editor and Toni is a nurse. They are incredibly nice people who converted their basement into a place for hikers to sleep, shower, and do laundry. All for the grand price of zero, nada, goose egg! Wow!
I am sharing the basement with a nice NOBO hiker named Grapenut and am once again clean, dry, and non-smelly. Not only that, there is no creepy doll hanging from the rafters.  Tomorrow - a new state!","Dan Quinn's Barn, VT Rt 12

I awoke this morning to a text from Marguerite and was surprised to find that it was 7:45 AM. I'm pretty sure that's the latest I've ever slept on the trail. Being nice and dark and quiet in the basement, Grapenut and I had slept late. 
Marguerite had texted to find out if I planned to wait out the weather before heading out. I went and looked out the window and was disappointed to see monsoonal rains. Obviously, she had been looking at the radar for the Hanover area. 
There's nothing worse than walking in the rain right after you've showered and laundered your clothes, so Grapenut and I were in no hurry to head out. Warren told us to hang out as long as we liked and invited us to have coffee with him. I think, since he works home alone, he likes having thru hikers to visit with. He even offered to loan us his spare car if we wanted to go resupply. Who does that!? Who offers up their car to complete strangers? We graciously declined since we would be walking right past a couple of stores. What a great guy!
It looked like the rain would pass through by noon, so we busied ourselves with changing our beds, washing the sheets and towels that we'd used, and sweeping the basement floor. Warren was so impressed that he said we had earned the ""Best Thru Hikers""'award for the day. 
The rain eventually let up and Grapenut and I headed out. As usual, I really liked my new friend. He was a young man who finished up his university degree a semester early and left to hike the AT with money he had saved up while working during college. 
First stop was Dan & Whit's General Store in Norwalk to resupply. The store also offers free day-old sandwiches from their deli to thru hikers, so we were set for second breakfast. 
We then followed the AT through Norwalk, across the Connecticut River, and into Hanover, NH. Another state completed - woo hoo! Hanover is home to Dartmouth College ($72K/year tuition! yikes!). Despite its Ivy League roots, Hanover is one of the most hiker friendly towns I've visited. People stopped us on the street to inquire about our hikes and wish us luck. The bakery offers a free donut to thru hikers and the pizza shop offers a free slice of pizza. We, of course made the rounds. 
At the bakery, I ran into Moonshine, Chlpmunk, Prometheus, and Honey Stick. I hadn't seen any of them since PA, so it was very nice to see them again. Grapenut and I walked around town and the college for awhile, enjoying the atmosphere of a small college town, with its coffee shops, pizza places, pubs, and co-eds. 
Eventually, somewhere around 3:00 PM, it was time to move on. Grapenut was sticking around to meet up with a friend, so we said our goodbyes and I followed the trail through town toward the woods. 
It was a gloomy day, the woods were soaked and dripping, I knew that Warren would be happy to put me up another night if I asked, and I knew that Sitting Bull, Hoops, Wizard, and Pluck would be rolling into town today. It would be so easy to wait for them and spend another day hanging out. I was beginning to feel the pull of the town vortex and needed to get going. So, I stuffed wool in my ears and put on blinders such that all I could see were the white blazes on the telephone poles; thereby, blocking out the Siren's song of Hanover. 
As I reached the end of town and entered the woods, I came across Moonshine, Chipmunk, Prometheus, and Honey Stick heading out of town. They invited me to join them at a campsite they'd heard about from some SOBOs on an island in the middle of Mink Brook, about eight miles north of town. They planned to build a fire and spend the evening together. I had planned to hike another 2.3 miles to Moose Mt Shelter; but, it sounded like a nice evening. 
We spent the rest of the afternoon hiking through damp, gray woods. It would've been a good day to hike with Peppa Pig. There were many muddy puddles in which to splash through in our boots. 
Eventually, we reached the fabled island in the middle of Mink Brook. It was as described, with room for all of us and for Dance and Fresh, who also joined us. We had a pleasant evening hanging out by the campfire. Everyone was most pleased when I produced a large bar of chocolate to share around the fire. Moonshine said that the chocolate was one of the best things about hiking around me and 1st Sgt. Thru hikers are so food motivated.

Beaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572047,"7/14/17, Hexacuba Shelter, NHMiles hiked: 1458.4, Miles to Katahdin: 413.5 Miles to go: 731.4
I was the first one up this morning in our little tent city on the island. I quietly packed up and got ready to head out. When I activated my SPOT tracker, I realized my batteries were low. The SPOT tracker is a GPS device that allows Marguerite to track my progress during the hike. It also has an SOS function were I to get into trouble on the trail. It's very nice because it gives her a certain peace of mind. I sent her my standard ""heading out"" message and turned the unit back off to preserve what battery life was left until I could replace them. 
It was another blustery, gray, chilly day. The trail was still mucky and muddy from all the rain we've been having and the trees were dripping water. All in all, another yucky day of hiking. It was also a pretty tough day of hiking. There was a lot of up and down. Smarts Mt proved to be much steeper than it looked on the profile in the AWOL guide. 
 At one point, about ten miles into the hike, I crossed the road that led into Lyme, NH, about 3.4 miles away. I decided to hitch hike to the Lyme General Store to buy batteries for my SPOT. My one other attempt to hitch was with 1st Sgt when we were trying to get from Port Clinton to the Cabela's. It was an abysmal failure. 
This road looked like a much better hitching road. It was a two lane road with a nice long straight away so you would have plenty of time to put on sad puppy dog eyes that the driver would have to intentionally ignore. There was also plenty of room for someone to pull over. 
I put on my best puppy dog face for the first car to go by. It was a big empty Suburban with just the driver in it. The woman gave me a shrug as she drove by, as if to say, ""Sorry. No room.""
The next car came by in the opposite lane - from the direction of Lyme. The woman stopped and put down the window. ""Where are you wanting to go?"", she asked. ""The Lyme General Store!"", I replied.  ""It's back that way"", she said, pointing over her shoulder. ""Yes. I'm aware of that. That's why I'm on this side of the road"" I replied. ""Sorry. I can't take you there"" she said, as she drove off. 
The next vehicle to come along, going the proper direction, was a big old worker man truck. He stopped and said, ""Hop in!"" He didn't bat an eye at the kilt (or the hiker smell) and whisked me away to town. On the way down the mountain, we had a pleasant conversation about the AT and thru hiking. Before too long I was standing in front of the Lyme General Store. 
It was the quintessential Yankee store - white clapboard building with big windows and a big front porch and gas pumps out front. Pure New England. I went in and found the batteries and went to check out the deli offerings. The lady at the deli said, ""It's your lucky day! It's Thai Friday! We have a lady who escaped Laos in 1975 that comes in every Friday and makes Thai food!"" Not what I was expecting; but, it turned out to be really good. 
 As I was sitting on the front porch of the store, eating my Thai food and charging my phone, this man comes puttering up to the pumps on his riding lawn mower. He's probably in his 70s and has a bit of a beer gut. He's wearing boots, shorts, a bomber jacket, and a straw cowboy hat with slots cut in the brim to fit ear protectors. He looks at me in my kilt and I look at him in his get-up and we both kind of 'hmpf' at how silly the other one looks. 
After I finished lunch, I started back across the town green and had not even reached the road when a young woman pulled up and asked if I needed a ride back to the trailhead. Wow! Easy Peazy mac and cheesy! After the young woman dropped me off, I was tempted to put my thumb back out and do it again since it was so easy the first time. However, that ""miles to go before I sleep"" thing kicked in and I started hiking. 
The rest of the day was spent climbing and dropping back down on sloppy trail in the clouds.  All the overlooks I passed were blank white screens - not a thing to see at any of them. The Smokies all over again. Bummer.
Eventually, I arrived at the Hexacuba Shelter. The shelter was pretty full, so I set my tent up. Shortly after I got settled in I heard, ""Hey! There's Beaker's tent!"" It was Sitting Bull and Hoops. They had cranked out a big mileage day to catch up so we can go through the Whites together. Woo hoo! Now all we have to do is light a fire under Wizard and Pluck to get them to catch up!","Stealth site on Mink Brook island, NH

I awoke today to... wait for it... rain! In fact, I awoke at midnight to heavy rain drumming on the roof of my tent. It continued to rain the rest of the night. Dragging yourself out of your tent into the rain is a tough thing to do. 
I was on the trail by 6:30 AM, but Sitting Bull and Hoops actually beat me out of camp this morning. The day looked like every other day we've had lately - gray, overcast, misty, humid, wet, and drippy. I've actually given up on wearing my glasses when I hike because it is either raining or so humid that they immediately fog up. It continued to rain off and on all day. We did have a few teasing moments of sunshine as if the trail was saying, ""See how beautiful the day could be!"" But, alas, it would cloud back over and turn all gray again. 
Don't even talk to me about the views! Every time I'd come to a rock outcropping on top of a mountain, I'd see this great expanse of white clouds and know that there was a spectacular view hiding in there. 
The heavy rain left the trail a soggy, slippery mess. The mud was slippery. The rocks were slippery. The roots were slippery. And the logs were slippery. As a result, I took a couple of tumbles today. Most were controlled tumbles that didn't result in any damage. Once, however, I was going down a muddy slope and my left foot slipped. I went straight down, bending my right leg under my butt and really straining my right knee. The problem was that I had a similar fall two days ago. Now my knee feels a little tender on the uphills and occasionally has an ominous click. 
This, of course, is just before we enter the White Mountains. The White Mountains are the hardest part of the entire trip. The ascents and descents are very steep and rocky and several of the mountains are 5000+ feet in elevation and are above tree line. 
1st Sgt's posts suggest that we are in for a tough week. Speaking of 1st Sgt, a few people have worried that we had some sort of falling out. Far from it. I've been working to close the gap from when I went off trail for a week; but, he appears to have really hit his stride now that his feet are feeling better. Sitting Bull, Hoops, and I hope to whittle away at his lead and still catch him before Mt Katahdin so we can all summit together. 
Just before noon, we came to VT 25A. The Green House restaurant sits 0.2 miles to the west of the trail crossing. So, of course, we had to stop for lunch. We arrived at the same time as two SOBO hikers. They joined us for lunch and we exchanged information about the trail ahead. 
After lunch, it was a quick 4.6 miles of hiking to VT Rt 25C and the Hiker's Welcome Hostel. During that short section, I did manage to take another tumble and break my right hiking pole. Bummer. 
When we arrived at the Hiker's Welcome, I was happy to see Tin Man and Ringer. I hadn't seen either of them since PA. It's funny how you never know who you will see from day to day. People who you think are miles ahead of you end up getting off trail for a few days and before you know it, you catch back up. 
We were able to shower, launder, and do all the important town things. We are spending the night in the bunk house. Tomorrow, the hostel staff will drive the majority of our stuff to the Notch Hostel in North Woodstock, NH. Sitting Bull, Hoops, and I will then hike up and over 4802 ft Mt Moosilauke carrying just the essentials we need for the day. Mt Moosilauke will be the first of the big, above treeline mountains. The 10 mile hike will take us most of the day since the ascent and descent are so steep. The weather forecast is looking pretty good for tomorrow. Let's hope it doesn't rain.

I awoke today to... you guessed it... sunshine! We hadn't seen the sun in so long. We were all excited to have good weather as we headed up our first big mountain in the Whites. 
Before hiking, we started the morning with a good breakfast of pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon prepared by the hostel staff. Sitting Bull, Hoops, and I had decided to slack pack the 9.3 miles up and over Mt Moosilauke. Slack packing involves hiking while carrying only the things you need for that day. We loaded most of our equipment, such as tent, sleeping bag, extra food, etc., into a bag that the hostel transported for us over to the next hostel. We just carried essentials, such as lunch, water, first aid kit, and extra clothes in our packs, thus reducing the weight from around 30 lbs to about 10 lbs. 
I found a spare hiking pole at the hostel to replace the one that I broke yesterday. It doesn't quite match my current pole; but, it works perfectly well. Sitting Bull also gave me a neoprene knee brace for my sore right knee. 
With full bellies and light packs, we headed out. The climb up Mt Moosilauke involved climbing 3793 ft in elevation over 5.5 miles. The trail was long and steep; but, not really too bad. Being a pretty weekend day, we encountered a lot of day hikers on our way up the mountain. As we neared the summit, the trees thinned out and eventually disappeared and the crowds got thicker as additional trails led to the summit. 
We lucked out at the summit and had beautiful, clear weather. We all took pictures at the the summit and settled in for lunch. After lunch, it was time to start the descent. This is when the fun really began. 
The descent down the north side of the mountain was much steeper than the ascent. It took us much longer to descend since we had to take it slow over several near vertical sections. My knees were screaming long before we were halfway down the long, grueling descent. We were trying to reach the bottom by 2:35 PM so we could catch the shuttle to the Notch Hostel. 
As we slowly worked our way down the mountain, it became more and more doubtful we were going to make the shuttle. Just as we had about given up on making the shuttle, the trail flattened out. We practically ran the last 0.4 miles to the trail head and arrived at 2:32 PM. It was just a matter of a couple of minutes before the shuttle van arrived and we loaded up for the ride to the hostel. 
The Notch Hostel is probably the cleanest hostel I've seen on the trail, with the possible exception of the Green Mountain House. It is also very well organized and homey. There are probably 20 hikers here tonight. 
We found out that Wizard and Pluck are also in town tonight. They came off the trail just past Mt Cube and are staying with a friend. So, they are actually about a day behind us on the trail. They came by the hostel with their friend and Sitting Bull, Hoops, and I joined them in a resupply trip to the Price Chopper, followed by dinner at a local restaurant. 
I am now back at the hostel planning out the next few days through the Whites. Tomorrow, we are going to slack pack 16 miles over Mt Wolf and Kinsman Mountain before returning to the hostel again tomorrow evening. After that we will head up into the Whites for a several day stretch. Unfortunately, thunderstorms are predicted for the next couple of days. Bummer.","Hiker's Welcome Hostel, Glencliff, NH

We awoke to another pretty day. Our plan was to slack pack 16.1 miles from Kinsman Notch, up and over Wolf Mountain and Kinsman Mountain, and down to Franconian Notch, where the shuttle would pick us up and return us to the Notch Hostel for another night. 
We were on the trail by 8:15 AM and immediately started climbing. The initial climb up Wolf Mt was very steep, requiring use of hands and feet at some places. I managed to have the most unusual fall on my whole trip so far. I was climbing up a slick, tilted rock about eight feet high. Just as I reached the top of the rock, my feet slipped and as I slid down the rock, my left hiking pole got wedged horizontally between a rock and a tree. I had my hand through the wrist strap on the pole. So, I ended up suspended in a prone position on the rock with my wrist trapped in the strap and my feet about a foot off the ground. 
I was stuck! I couldn't release my wrist and I couldn't get my feet on the ground. Hoops had to push my hiking pole loose and allow me to slide back down the rock face to the ground. She, of course, got a big kick out of my strange fall. 
The remainder of the climb up Wolf Mt was steep but uneventful. The mud on Wolf Mt was plentiful and deep. Sitting Bull stepped in it once and sunk almost up to his knee. After taking in the incredible views from the summit of Wolf Mt and descending past the Eliza Brook shelter to the base of Kinsman Mt, the real climbing started. 
I'm so glad I decided to slack pack this section. I couldn't imagine carrying my full pack over this mountain. I thoroughly enjoyed hiking with my young companions. To pass the time, we tried to name the capitals of all the states. Between the three of us, we could come up with the majority of them. 
After much rock scrambling, we reached the summit. It felt like we were on the top of the world. We could see mountains in every direction. Especially prominent was the Franconia Ridge that we will walk tomorrow. By the time we finished lunch, it was already 2:30 PM. We had three hours to make the descent and catch the shuttle. Also, dark clouds were beginning to collect on the horizon. 
The descent wasn't as bad as yesterday's descent of Mt Moosilauke; however, it wasn't long until my knees were grumbling again. On the way down, we passed the first of the Appalachian Mountain Club's huts, Lonesome Lake Hut. The huts are more like rustic lodges that people hike to (and pay big bucks) to spend the night. They are scattered throughout the White Mts. You will hear more about them later. 
By now, it was going on 4:00 PM, we still had 2.8 miles to hike, and we were hearing distant rumbles of thunder. So, we picked up the pace. The next hour and a half was virtually a run down the mountain, trying to reach the pickup point by 5:30 PM with a storm on our tails. 
We reached the pickup point at 5:20 PM, just as the first big drops of rain were splattering around us. Luckily, having seen the weather forecast, the shuttle driver had arrived early. Just as we dove into the van, the skies opened up! It was a huge storm, complete with pounding rain, thunder, lightning, and dime sized hail. 
When we got back to the hostel, it looked like it had snowed, there was so much hail in the ground. It quickly began to sublimate, creating a thick, eerie fog. To top it off, the hostel had lost power. 
Luckily, Wizard and Pluck were still in town, having slacked over Moosilauke and returned to their friend's house. They all came and picked us up and we went out to dinner. By the time we returned, power had been restored and life was back to normal. 
Tomorrow, I head up Franconian Ridge. The weather forecast isn't the greatest; but, we'll hope for the best. Sitting Bull and Hoops have to pick up packages in town and will be a bit behind; however, they hike faster than my and should catch up quickly. As I head deeper into the Whites, I don't know about phone reception, so don't be surprised if you don't hear from me for a day or two; but, I'll update as soon as I can.","The Notch Hostel, North Woodstock, NH

Today ranks as one of the best days I've spent on the trail. We awoke to beautiful skies at the Notch Hostel. Sitting Bull and Hoops had to wait for the post office to open to pick up packages, so they were still sleeping when I left on the 7:45 AM shuttle to Franconia Notch. 
The climb out of the notch was long and steep. Just to clarify, what we called gaps in the South are now called notches here in the North. Just like ""Gap"", ""Notch"" is a four letter word. It took me two hours to climb the 2.3 miles to Franconia Ridge. As I neared the top of the ridge, the trees began to thin out. I finally broke out of the tree line to a spectacular scene. The ridge stretched out in front of me, with the AT running along the spine. It was rugged and beautiful. The White Mountains are the toughest hiking we've done on the trail; but, the views are spectacular. 
When I reached the summit of Mt Lincoln, there was a former thru hiker named Trail Mix providing trail magic. He and his friends hauled a bunch of food up several miles of steep trail to provide trail magic. He even had frozen margaritas! Wow!
As I started down the back side of Mt Lafayette, started hiking with two women who were heading to the Galehead Hut for the night. We hiked together for several miles, with them asking me question after question about thru hiking. It was a lot of fun. They were both marathon runners and reminded me of my ""7@7"" girls. 
The Huts are an interesting phenomenon in the White Mts. They are rustic lodges that sleep 30-90 people. They can only be reached by hiking to them. The Huts predate the AT and are managed by the Appalachian Mountain Club. They are expensive and require reservations to stay. The are manned by ""croos"" of college age kids. They are famous for their incredible meals. 
They also allow a couple of thru hikers to ""work for stay"" every night. In exchange for sweeping the floor, or washing the dishes, etc, the thru hikers get to eat leftover food after the guests eat and are allowed to sleep on the floor in the dining hall. Getting work for stay in the Huts is one of those iconic AT experiences. 
There is a bit of an art to getting chosen for work for stay. If you arrive too early in the day, they send you on your way. If you arrive too late, they've already filled the spots. I arrived too late. They had taken in four thru hikers already.
I tried the puppy dog eyes. I tried the kilt and funny hat, explaining that I could regale the guests with stories of thru hiking. I thought I almost had him there; but, he said he just didn't have room. He did tell me about a nice stealth spot nearby and offered to feed me leftover breakfast if I stopped by in the morning. 
I am now set up in the stealth site. There are actually six other work for stay rejects camping here, mostly SOBOs. We had fun eating our dinners together and discussing what lies  ahead on the trail. It looks like it will be a nice night and tomorrow is forecast to be another beautiful day.

I awoke to another beautiful day. I was up and on my way by 7:30 AM, after stopping at the Galehead Hut for water. I immediately started a near vertical climb to the summit of South Twin Mountain. I was rewarded for my efforts when I broke treeline and was greeted by one of the most incredible views I've had yet. In all directions, all I could see was row upon row of mountains. Mount Washington, which is where I am heading tomorrow, was especially prominent on the horizon. 
My marathoner friends from yesterday, Beth and Kirsten, arrived at the summit while I was soaking in the views. They had spent the night at Galehead Hut and were completing the second half of their hike today. We hiked together for a couple of miles, picking up the conversation where we had left off yesterday. Eventually, our paths diverged and we said our goodbyes. 
The rest of the morning was spent climbing up and down rocky pathways. I soon dropped below treeline again and didn't have any more views for the rest of the day. 
Around noon, I arrived at Zeeland Falls Hut and stopped in for a bowl of potato kale soup and some baked goods. After resting my tired knees awhile, I headed out again. The rest of the afternoon was spent descending into Crawford Notch, where the AT crosses NH Rt 3 before starting the climb up Mt Washington. You would think that descending would be better than ascending; however, descending is murder on the knees.  
I had planned to get a head start on the climb up Mt Washington by hiking another 5.9 miles to Mitzpah Hut; however, as I descended toward Crawford Notch, I realized that I was tired, even though I had only hiked 14.6 miles. We NOBOs had been warned by everyone who knows anything about the AT to be prepared to slow down in the Whites; however, it's still sobering when you've gotten used to 20-25 mile days to find that 10-15 mile days are whipping your butt!
As I stopped to filter water just before Crawford Notch, Jailbird, another graybeard hiker that I have been hiking around the past couple of days, caught up. When we reached Crawford Notch, we found out that the whole area was part of a state park and camping was forbidden. So, we decided to share a tent site at a nearby campground. As we were passing through the parking lot at the notch, Jailbird asked some people who were getting in their pickup if they would give us a ride to the campground. They said to hop in the back and we were on our way. 
When we reached the campground, we discovered that they also had single room cabins available. We decided it was worth a little extra to have actual beds, electricity, and a roof, especially since it was clouding up and threatening rain. 
I am now clean, my clothes are now clean, and we are all ready to take on Mt Washington tomorrow. We will be traversing a 12 mile section above treeline and the second highest peak on the entire AT, where measurable snowfall has been recorded in every month of the year and winds were once recorded at greater than 230 mph. Let's all pray for good weather.","Stealth site near Galehead Hut, NH

Jailbird and I awoke around 5:00 AM and started packing up to head back to the trail. We were ready to leave around 6:00 AM. The problem was that we were 3.3 miles from the trailhead and on a country road. We tried to hitch; but, cars were only passing about once every 5 or 10 minutes and no one was stopping. Finally, the owner of the campground came out and said he'd run us up to the trailhead. Yay!
We were on the trail by 7:00 AM and started climbing immediately. It was a typical White Mts climb - long and steep, with several portions of hand over hand climbing. At least, the weather was beautiful and the views were incredible. 
I reached the Mitzpah Spring Hut around 11:00 AM and bought a lunch of cheesy chili, bread and baked goods. Immediately after the Hut, the trail went straight up. A difficult climb was even harder with a full belly! Shortly after the Hut, I summited Mt Pierce and was into the Presidential Range proper. The trees dropped away before the summit and I was in the alpine environment the Whites are famous for. 
The mountains above treeline have a stark beauty that is just incredible. I was surprised to find that I pretty much had the mountains to myself. We appear to be running out of the SOBO bubble somewhat and, for some reason, there did not appear to be many NOBOs around. 
I arrived at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut around 2:00 PM. It is located about 1.5 miles and 1200 ft below the summit of Mt Washington. It was another 7 miles to Madison Hut and there was nowhere to camp in between. Also, there was a chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. So, I decided to stay here. I inquired about work for stay; but, they couldn't accept any until 4:00 PM. The woman at the desk said that I could pay $10 and sleep on the floor of the dining room. So, that's what I did. 
The rest of the afternoon was spent hanging out and staying out of the way of the paying guests. It's fun to compare the raggedy hiker trash to the LL Bean hikers who are staying here. They are all so clean and dapper. We aren't. 
Thru hikers filtered in all afternoon. We now have me, Terminator, Jailbird, Hops, Grapenut, Yogi, Bearslayer, Aslan, Wonder Woman, and Birdperson hanging out and staying out of the way of the paying guests. 
After the paying guests ate, the thru hikers were invited in to finish off the leftovers. We really are doing them a service because they have to carry out the leftovers to be composted. So, the hut croos are happy for us to finish off the leftovers. I think the paying guests just think we are a quaint oddity. At 9:30 PM, at lights out, we will be able to bed down in the dining room until 6:30 AM, when they wake up the guests. 
It's funny - this is the most like a homeless person I have felt on the trail. But it's also kind of fun to hang out with the rest of the hiker trash on the margins. Tomorrow - the summit of Mt Washington. Woo hoo!","Crawford Notch campground, NH

The thru hikers were up and out of the dining room by 6:30 AM when the hut guests were awakened by the croo at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut. We sat over in the corner while the guests ate breakfast. When they were done, we ate the leftovers. Since my $10 just reserved a spot on the floor and didn't technically include food, I went ahead and did some chores. So, in essence, I paid $10 for work for stay. I guess I should have asked for my $10 back; but, I really wasn't that worried about it. 
My chore consisted of picking up the trash the guests left on their bunks when they left - candy wrappers, used ear plugs, socks, hair ties, a package of birth control pills, and a large garden trowel. Whatever.
 I'm sure that the guests were not impressed with the thru hikers. That's OK, because we weren't very impressed with them. They ignored the signs that directed people to stay on the paths and off the fragile alpine plants. Many felt it was necessary to swim and bathe in the fragile alpine lakes for which the hut is named. And they felt that since they were paying big bucks to stay there, they didn't need to pick up after themselves. 
I didn't get started hiking until 9:30 AM. I was hoping the late start would give the mist time to burn off on the summit of Mt Washington. No such luck. I climbed the 1.5 miles to the summit in a heavy fog. When I reached the summit, I was assaulted by even more tourists. These were pouring out of cars, buses, and the cog railway cars to rush across the parking lot and stand in line to take selfies at the summit sign before hitting the gift shop. To say the least, I didn't hang around long at the summit. 
Of course, as soon as I left the summit, the fog dissipated and left the summit in full sun.   As I passed the cog railway tracks, I refrained from taking part in the long tradition of thru hikers mooning the tourists as they chugged up the mountain. I think the tradition has died out somewhat since the engines switched from coal to diesel and the engineers are no longer armed with chunks of coal to throw at the bare hiker butts (although, I did hear from one hiker who did moon the tourists this week). 
The next eight miles of the hike were spent crossing a boulder field above treeline. The hiking was definitely tough; but, the incredible views made it so worth it. We have been so lucky with the weather through the White Mountains so far. Although this has been the hardest part of the entire hike, it has definitely been my favorite section. 
I arrived at the Madison Spring Hut around 2:00 PM and had soup and baked goods for lunch again. Then I climbed to the summit of Mt Madison - another incredibly steep climb up a boulder field. Finally, after the summit of Mt Madison, I began to descend. I dropped 3000 ft over the next seven miles. Most of the drop occurred steeply over the first three miles.   
Eventually, I reached NH Rt 16 at Pinkham Notch a little after 7:00 PM. The long hike across the boulder field in the full sun, followed by the long descent, left me totally spent. I had planned to find a stealth site for the night; but, the thought of finding a site and performing all the evening chores seemed a little too overwhelming. In the end, I called and booked a bunk in the Barn Hostel in Gorham. 
When I walked in the door of the hostel I was shocked to see Antman sitting there. I haven't seen him since Franklin, NC, and thought he was way up in Maine about to summit Katahdin. It turns out that, like everyone else, the relentless pace has taken its toll and he's slowed way down and spent time off-trail. 
After showering I headed out to McDonalds to get some quick dinner. As I was passing another restaurant I was surprised to see Ramsey Bolton standing out front! He was waiting on some friends  to take him to their cabin for the weekend. The surprises kept coming. He took me inside, where Hummingbird was waiting. Wow! I hadn't seen Hummingbird since Partnership Shelter way back in Southwestern Virginia. Once again, I thought he was way ahead. It took him a second to recognize me because he hadn't seen me since I cut my hair and beard. 
Soon, Ramsey's friends arrived and they took off. I finished my dinner, and headed back to the hostel, where I am sitting in a comfy chair writing my blog. 
I also got a text from Sitting Bull. It turns out that they are just few hours behind me. They summited Mt Washington early this afternoon and were planning to hike to Pinkham Notch and this evening. Hopefully, we will be back together tomorrow and may even be back with Ramsey and Hummingbird Sunday night. Unfortunately, we've pretty much given up on catching 1st Sgt before Katahdin.
This month, I've received word of two acquaintances my age or younger who have passed away. Those deaths have reminded me that none of us know how many days we've been allocated. If there is something you want to do, don't put it off any longer than is necessary. There have been days on this hike that I haven't enjoyed or when I've been bored; but, the past few days, with the incredible scenery and seeing friends I never expected to see again, have reminded me once again just how lucky I am to be able to undertake this incredible journey. Get out there and do that incredible journey you've always planned to do yourself someday.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut, NH

I got up early and went to Welsh's Restaurant for a good breakfast because I knew I had a day of hard hiking ahead of me. When I returned to the the hostel, I was surprised to see Ninja and Lighthouse there (they were the ones I climbed Mt Killington with). It turns out they had also been at the hostel last night and we had just not seen each other. It was like Old Home Week around here - running into all kinds of old hiking friends. 
I was back on the trail around 8:00 AM. I only had a 13.4 mile day planned to the Imp Campsite; however, it was going to be a tough 13 miles! I had to cross the Wildcat and Carter Mountain ranges and it involved a lot of climbing. A LOT of climbing. These ranges are still part of the White Mountains and the Whites weren't going to give us any breaks. 
It was the same story we've had for the past few days. Long, steep ascents. So steep, in fact, that I collapsed my hiking poles and put them in my pack so I would have my hands free for climbing. Whoever named the peaks on Wildcat Mt wasn't very creative. We crossed Wildcat Mt Peak E, then Wildcat Mt Peak D, then Wildcat Mt Peak C, and finally Wildcat Mt Peak A. I assume there is a Wildcat Mt Peak B out there somewhere - we just didn't hike over it. Either that or some cartographer didn't knew their alphabet very well. 
Today's hike was different than what we've been experiencing lately in that we didn't go above treeline. We spent most of the day climbing in a rocky, pine tunnel. Every now and then, we'd pop out of the trees and have another incredible view. The weather cooperated for yet another day. It was somewhat cloudy; but, no rain. On Wildcat Mt Peak A we had a view down into Carter Notch, where we could see the Carter Notch Hut 1200 ft below. We could also look across the notch to Carter Dome where we were headed next. The only problem is that we had to drop down 1200 ft, just to climb straight back up. At least I was able to take a break at the hut and have my last lunch of soup and baked goods before leaving the Whites. 
After filling up on soup and baked goods, I started the long climb up Carter Dome with a full, heavy belly. It seems like the AMC always places the Huts at the bottom of big climbs so we can suffer more by climbing with full bellies when all we want to do at that point is nap and digest. I struggled up and over Carter Dome, down through Zeta Pass and back up and over South, Middle, and North Carter Mountains. 
Then came the descent off North Carter. It was the steepest descent I've done yet on the trail. There were vertical sections where I had to sit down and slide on my butt (not so easy in a kilt!). It's the first time I've felt skittish  hiking. I'm glad I wasn't doing it in the rain. 
I eventually made it to Imp Campsite. It is pretty full here tonight. All the tent pads are taken and the shelter is full. I was able to set up my tent in a small clearing next to the caretaker's tent. It's mostly weekend hikers here tonight, with just a few thru hikers. I heard from Sitting Bull. He and Hoops have caught up and are stealth camped on the approach trail to the shelter. I will pass them on my way out of camp on the morning. 
Tomorrow will be a short eight mile hike into Gorham. We will cross over Mt Moriah and descend to the Androscoggin River, where we will officially leave the White Mountains. Next stop - Maine!","The Barn Hostel, Gorham, NH

I awoke to another pretty day. It was a little overcast when I first got up; but, it soon cleared, leaving full sunshine. I packed up and headed out a little after 7:00 AM. I had a Nearo day planned, with an 8 mile hike into the White Mountain Lodge and Hostel. First, I had to climb up and over Mt Moriah, our last Peak in the White Mountains National Forest. 
The climb up Mt Moriah actually wasn't too bad. About a mile into the hike, I came upon Sitting Bull and Hoops stealth camping, having passed the Imp Shelter late in the evening. I stopped to visit for a few minutes and found out that they were staying at the same hostel. I later saw Terminator on the trail and found that he was also heading for the White Mt Hostel. 
 The descent from Mt Moriah started out pretty steep, pounding my poor abused knees with each step. Eventually, the slope moderated and before long I was cruising on fairly smooth and gently sloping trail. It's as if the AT was rewarding me for being such a Brave & Fierce thru hiker through the White Mountains by allowing me to cruise the last few miles into town. 
We were incredibly lucky with the weather through the Whites. We had beautiful days and gorgeous views all the way through, which is almost unheard of. Now that we are out of the Whites, I can reveal the secret to our incredible weather - Slug Plants. I guess I should back up and explain a little better. 
While hiking over Kinsman Mountain with Sitting Bull and Hoops a few days ago, we came upon a pair of Frogg Togg rainpants lying in the middle of the trail. They were completely blown out in the crotch, with a ten inch rip in them. Many hikers carry Frogg Toggs because they are cheap and light. If they rip out, which happens often, you just discard them and buy more. They tend to be hot and do not breathe well, like just about all the rain gear out there, which is why I quit even trying to wear any. You get just as wet from sweat wearing rain gear as the you get from the rain when not wearing rain gear. Unfortunately, they had been discarded in the middle of the trail.  Being the Leave No Trace thru hikers that we are, Sitting Bull reached to pick them up to put in his pack to haul out to the trash. 
He quickly dropped the pants when he saw they were covered with slugs. Now, these weren't normal slugs. These were White Mountain slugs - a particularly nasty breed that leaves sticky orange slime on everything. Rather than leave the trash on the trail, I picked them up and started flicking off the slugs - all 11 of them. Sitting Bull then put the pants in the outer pocket of his pack and packed them out. 
The White Mountains are notorious for sudden shifts in weather, especially above treeline, that can leave you in a precarious position. Hypothermia is a huge concern, which is why everyone we met urged us to carry rain gear through the Whites. I had a rain jacket, which I wear in particularly cold rain to keep me warm rather than dry; but, since I hike in a kilt, I was not carrying rainpants. 
I decided to hang on to those pants, tape up the rip, and carry them as emergency rain pants through the Whites. I meant to rinse off the slug slime, but never got around to it. It is my belief that the Mountain Weather Gods, seeing that I respected and feared them enough to carry Slug Pants through the mountains, were pleased enough to grant me safe passage. Even though they don't know it, the hikers around me owe me a debt of gratitude for carrying Slug Pants, resulting in beautiful weather for them also. 
When I arrived at the White Mt Hostel this afternoon, I discarded the Slug Pants. Tomorrow's weather forecast is calling for a 90% chance of rain, with up to 3/4 inches of rain expected. Bummer. I guess the Mountain Weather Gods were still watching. 
I also received new trail runners that Marguerite had ordered for me from REI and had shipped to the hostel. The last pair lasted a grand total of three weeks. Three weeks! I told you the Whites were tough! They were blown out at the sides and ends of the toes and big chunks were missing from the soles. 
The rest of the day was spent taking care of town chores. At one point, Ramsey and Hummingbird passed on their way out of town. They had spent the weekend with friends and were getting back on-trail. 
Volunteer, a graybeard retired chemical engineer that I've been hiking around the past few days, arrived and was able to get a room for the night. We are watching the weather for tomorrow. If we awake to heavy rain, we plan to zero in town. The hostel is already booked up for tomorrow, so we may have to head to a motel in town. Sitting Bull and Hoops, beginning to feel the time weighing heavy as the upcoming Fall college semester looms ever larger, plan to press on tomorrow. We'll see if their resolve waivers if we are faced with heavy rain tomorrow...","Imp Campsite, NH

I awoke to overcast skies, but no rain. So, I decided to head out rather than take a zero day. I got on the trail by 7:30 AM. Sitting Bull and Hoops were still eating breakfast when I left. I passed Ramsey Bolton's stealth camp about a mile into the hike. He was still asleep when I passed. 
Around 8:30 AM, it started to sprinkle. Before long, it settled into a steady rain that lasted the rest of the day. We are out of the Whites; but, we are not out of the mountains. Today's hike proved to be pretty tough, with a couple decent climbs and scrambling over some big boulders. The rain just added to the fun, providing mud and slippery rocks. 
Before long, I was soaked to the skin. It was a cold, blustery day, so I wore my rain jacket to provide a little warmth. Anytime I would stop for more than a minute or two, I would start to get chilled. The whole day proved to be like this. Up, down, mud, rocks, rain. 
I'm not going to complain any more about the rain, though, because crossing the summit of Mt Success gave me just a little taste of what it would've been  like to traverse the Whites in rain. Not fun - bone chilling winds and blowing rain. 
I had lunch at Gentian Pond Shelter with Grapenut, Yogi, and Bearslayer. We all ate quickly and got moving again to warm back up. I managed to take several spills today. Nothing serious. Just enough to get me wet and muddy. 
I passed several high mountain ponds and bogs. If I was a moose, I would've thought they would be perfect places to hang out. Apparently, the moose didn't agree. I still haven't seen any moose - just piles of moose poop. 
The highlight of the day came just before reaching the shelter at the end of the day. I crossed the Maine-New Hampshire border! Woo hoo! This day seemed like an impossibility way back in February when I stood on Springer Mountain in Georgia. 
I finally reached Carlo Col Shelter just after 6:00 PM. It was definitely a long, slow day on the trail. I was looking forward to just rolling out my sleeping pad in the shelter and getting into warm, dry clothes. No such luck - the shelter was packed! No worries. I would just set up my tent on one of the tent pads. Wrong! All five wooden tent pads were occupied by what appears to be a French Canadian youth group.  At least I assume it's a French Canadian youth group because there are a bunch of pre-teens running around screaming in French. 
I am now set up on a sloping piece of ground near the shelter. It's going to be one of those nights where I slide downhill and pull myself back up all night long. The temperature is in the low 40s, the wind is rattling the tent, and the rain is pelting down. It feels more like March than July. It least I am safe, warm, and dry in my cozy tent. I can't wait to put on those wet hiking clothes in the morning...","White Mountain Lodge and Hostel, Gorham, NH

Remember back awhile when I said that I had the mistaken impression that the trail through NJ, NY, CT, and MA to Greylock would be a cruise and that I was sorely mistaken? Well, I've done it again. For some reason, I thought that once we finished the White Mountains it would be a cruise to Mt Katahdin. Wrong!
I hiked 9.5 miles today and it was a full day. I awoke to rain at Carlo Col Shelter. It had rained pretty much all night; but, I managed to stay pretty dry. Where I was camped on a slope, I slid down during the night and my feet touched the side of the tent, resulting in my sleeping pad and quilt getting a little damp. 
Of course, my clothes from yesterday were still soaked. Putting on cold, clammy, smelly clothes is probably the most unpleasant aspect of the day. After you get moving, you don't notice; but, first putting them on is always unpleasant. 
By the time I hit the trail, the rain had tailed off and the clouds actually began to thin. By afternoon, I was hiking in full sunshine. The  trail was still a muddy, mucky mess though. The rocks were still wet and slick, which made the steep descents fairly treacherous. I lost count of how many times I went down. Most of the falls were slow and fairly controlled. I had one pretty bad fall on my left hip which left it pretty bruised and tender, though. 
The climbs continued to be steep, with sections where rebar steps were embedded in the vertical rock face. I felt like I was on a via ferata, only instead of a safety harness j had a 30 lb pack. I also ascended several ingenious log ladders. The trail maintainers in southern Maine sure have their act together. 
I stopped for lunch at the Full Goose Shelter and while I was eating, Hummingbird walked up. I was very surprised to see him because when I had last seen him in Gorham he said he was ready to be finished and planned to knock out big miles. When I reminded him of this, he said that he got to Carlo Col Shelter yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM and decided to stay rather than hike in the rain. He had actually been at the shelter when I arrived yesterday evening. I just hadn't seen him in the crowd. 
After lunch is when the real fun began. I hiked a couple of AT icons - the Mahoosuc Notch and the Mahoosuc Arm. The Mahoosuc Notch is a mile long narrow Gorge with steep, high walls. Over the millennia, rocks have broken loose and fallen into the gorge, resulting in a jumble of boulders and rocks of assorted sizes and shapes 20 - 30 feet deep, like piles of giant Legos all jumbled up. There are places in the Mahoosuc Notch that still have ice that hasn't melted by mid-July. 
This mile long section of the trail is billed as the most hated and most loved mile of the AT. You have to scramble over, under, and around these boulders as you pick your way through the notch. At one place the passage under a boulder was so small, I had to remove my pack and push it ahead of me as I squirmed through on my belly. Many times I had to sit down and slide down a tilted boulder - not always an easy feat in a kilt. It took me about an hour and a half to work my way through the notch. Luckily, the sun had dried out the rocks before my passage, making them much less slick. 
Upon completing the Mahoosuc Notch, I faced another obstacle - the Mahoosuc Arm.   It consists of a climb gaining over 1500 feet of elevation over 0.9 miles. There were many sections that went almost straight up. It was just a matter of settling in and slogging out the mile long climb. Once again, a dry trail made this a much better climb. 
At the top of Mahoosuc Arm, it was a short hike to Speck Pond Shelter. I got here around 5:00 PM, which gave me time to dry out some of my equipment a little. It was not nearly as packed as the last shelter. So, I was able to get a tent platform. All in all, it was a tough day; but a fun one.","Carlo Col Shelter, ME

It was a clear night last night and got pretty chilly. I was nice and warm under my down quilt, so it was very hard to drag myself out of bed this morning. As a result, I didn't get on-trail until after 7:00 AM. I find without 1st Sgt's influence, I tend to be a bit lazier about getting going In the morning. I'm still hoping to catch him in time to summit Mt Katahdin with him. Another old friend, J, who hiked with me and 1st Sgt for awhile in CT and MA, was at the shelter last night. He was up and gone while I was still lazing in my tent. We 
Another thing that slowed me down this morning was my tired body. Yesterday's hike left me a bit stiff and sore. I took a pretty good fall onto my left hip, leaving it feeling bruised today. I know you are probably getting tired of hearing it: but, all of us NOBOs are getting weary. Not just tired, which you can recover from after a day's rest, but weary, which takes an extended period to recover from. It's not just me and 1st Sgt and the older hikers either. It's everyone.
 I must admit that I was glad to hear Hummingbird, who is 25-30 years younger than me and continues to fly past me on uphills like I'm standing still, say that he was finding Southern Maine to be tough. My friend Antman, who I met my second day on the AT and who is also 25-30 years younger than me, has decided to leave the trail for a while to rest up and put back on some weight. He's down to 133 lbs and just not feeling the trail love. 
Ok. Enough whining! Today's hike was actually quite nice. We were back to cloudless cerulean skies. I even broke out the sunglasses today. We had several steep climbs; but, they weren't utterly ridiculous. OK, we did have a couple log ladders and rebar rungs set into vertical rock faces; but, it wasn't like yesterday. 
I climbed up and over Old Speck Mt and dropped down to Grafton Notch, where I caught up with J and his two hiking companions. Then it was a fairly gentle climb up to Baldpate Lean-to for lunch (shelters in ME are called Lean-tos). Then I got down to business and started the steep climb to the summit of the West Peak of Baldpate Mt, followed by a traverse of a rocky saddle and then a steep climb up the rocky and exposed East Baldpate Summit. Once again, I was glad for dry wether and wondered about the hikers who crossed this in wet weather. 
After another small but steep bump, I began a four mile descent to B Hill Rd, where I had made arrangements to be picked up by a shuttle at 5:45 PM and be taken to the Pine Ellis Hostel in Andover, ME. I arrived at 5:38 PM, along with another NOBO named Ace. We waited for the shuttle, and waited...and waited... We would've hitched to the hostel; but, this was a rural road and no cars passed. We would've called the hostel; but, we had no cell service. So, we waited...
Finally at 6:40 PM, a minivan roared up with two rotund, fairly toadish women in the front seat. The driver apologized for being so late. The hostel had sent her to the wrong road crossing to pick us up and she wasn't happy. As we jumped in, she offered us lukewarm lemonade as compensation. We were a little scared to refuse. She roared off at high speed down this country road with Ace and me trying to keep from spilling our lukewarm lemonade. 
We arrived at Pine Ellis Hostel, which is basically these people's house to which they've added a bunch of beds. It turns out that I know over half of the the other hikers here. I quickly showered, threw my clothes into the wash, and headed to the General Store/Diner to grab some dinner before they closed. 
Although this isn't the nicest hostel I've visited, I've decided to do an 11 mile slack pack tomorrow and spend another night. I think I would go crazy sitting around here all day, so the slack pack is a good alternative. I will still get another 11 miles in; but, I won't be carrying the weight of my full pack and I'll only spend about five or six hours hiking. The shorter day will also give my friends behind me a chance to catch up. Hopefully, in another 60 miles or so we will begin to hike out of the big mountains of Southern Maine.","Speck Pond Shelter, ME

 I awoke to a steady rain at the Pine Ellis Hostel and seriously thought about just taking a full zero day and staying in bed. Of course, I've never been good about sleeping in, so I got up and went to breakfast at the Red Hen restaurant. It is famous in these parts for its breakfasts. 
While I was eating breakfast, the rain stopped. So, I came back and loaded up a day pack with lunch and a few essentials and caught the 9:00 AM shuttle to the trailhead. I was taking a page out of 1st Sgt's game book and doing a ""rolling rest day"". I was slackpacking a ten mile section of the trail. By slackpacking, which consists of carrying a light pack with just a few essentials, I was able to give my body, particularly my knees, a rest while still continuing to knock down those miles to Katahdin. 
The section I was hiking was actually a pretty tame section. There was only one really steep climb near the end of the hike. The rest of the hike was gently rolling and not too rocky - a bit of a rarity for southern Maine. I hiked most of the day with Wild Thing, a primary school teacher in his forums from the U.K.  From what I can see, his name appears to be a misnomer. He's a very pleasant man and I enjoyed the hike very much. 
Several younger hikers who'd been hiking with Wild Thing before getting separated in the Whites caught up with us. It was fun to observe the joyful reunion. It's funny how intense the friendships become on the trail. You really don't know that much about the people in general, including their real names; but, hiking through blowing rain and insane terrain together builds a strong bond. And age does not appear to be a factor. Some of my best friends on the trail are 30-35 years younger than me. 
Feather, a young hiker Ive crossed paths with over the last few days, joined us for the remainder of the hike. About a mile before the pick up point, the threatening skies finally followed through on their threats and started soaking us with a steady rain. Luckily, we arrived at the pick up point at about the same time as the shuttle. In no time, we were back at the Pine Ellis Hostel. 
 I quickly showered and got my wet, smelly clothes into the laundry. The rest of the afternoon was devoted to lounging. Around 5:30 PM I headed to the Red Hen for Mexican Buffet - Thursday is Mexican night! Apparently, every hiker in a twenty mile radius knew that Thursday is Mexican Night. The place was packed! A few intrepid locals were present; but, the majority of the customers were hikers. The cool thing, looking around the room, is that I knew the majority of them - including Sitting Bull and Hoops!
They had come off the trail at the same road crossing as I did yesterday. So, they are 10 miles behind me on the trail. We made plans to meet up in Rangely on Saturday. I decided to head across the street to the General Store, where it was less frenetic. 
I am now back in my room (with four other people) and settling in for the night. Tomorrow, I will continue walking north. Katahdin calls...","Pine Ellis Hostel, Andover, ME

I ended up with a snorer in the bed next to me in the hostel. He was this guy named Redlegs whose apparently been hanging around the hostel the past few days. He appears to drink heavily and pass out in random places. The first night I was there, he slept under the porch swing. Last night, he apparently discovered the bed next to me was unoccupied and crashed there sometime after I went to sleep. I awoke in the middle of the night to very loud snoring next to me. Luckily, I keep my earplugs handy whenever I stay in a hostel. I'm not sure why they haven't kicked him out at the hostel. 
The shuttle dropped me off at the AT trailhead and I was hiking by 8:15 AM. I started out immediately with a steep climb to the top of Old Blue Mountain, complete with vertical climbs, rebar rungs in the rock faces and log ladders. 
Once I reached the top of Old Blue Mt, the trail settled down and, though I had ups and downs, I didn't have any more vertical climbs. The weather was perfect! Full sun, light breezes, and temps in the 70s. The only real issue is that the trail is very rooty. The tree roots can be very slick and it's easy to trip over them. So, you have to watch your step. 
I ended up having lunch with J and his two companions. They were slack packing south from Rt 17 and back to Andover. I came upon them eating lunch near the summit of Bemis Mt and joined them. After lunch, several of the guys I've been hiking around lately started to pass me - Feathers, Scout, Wild Thing, and others. They were all making for Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to also. 
Late in the afternoon, as I was approaching a gravel road about 13 miles into the hike, I saw a hand written sign that said trail magic ahead. Woo hoo! As I reached the trail magic, the guy at the grill says, ""Hey, Rusty! It's about time you get here! We've been expecting you all afternoon."" I was caught off-guard to be addressed by my real name since I'm so used to being called Beaker on the trail. 
It turns out that Snowman and his wife Teddie drive 140 miles round trip weekly from Lewiston, ME, to do trail magic at this spot. It also turns out that they read my blog on TrailJournals. These guys really know how to put on trail magic - hamburgers, hot dogs, soda, blueberries, bananas, potato chips, and various snack cakes. Wow! 
Before long, Feathers, Scout, Wild Thing, Waldo, Giggles, Big Style, Misplaced, Hats, Lucky, 4 Wheel Drive, and Odin were gathered around eating burgers and dogs. It was great! I am once again amazed by the generosity of the trail angels we run into on the trail. Thanks again Snowman and Teddie! It was wonderful!
Unfortunately, I still had another four miles today hike. So, I took my leave and headed out. Shortly after heading out, I passed a SOBO wearing a UT hat and commented on it. He stopped and said, ""Wait! I'm supposed to give a message to a NOBO from Knoxville hiking in a kilt. 1st Sgt says to hurry and catch up."" 
After another fairly steep climb and a hike along the ridgeline, I arrived at Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to (the shelters in Maine are called lean-tos for some reason). The slanting evening sun on the pond (which actually was a fairly large lake) was beautiful. And the pond has loons! I love to hear the loons. 
I am now set up in my tent next to the shelter  with most of the people that were at the trail magic. This is a nice group of people who have been traveling together for quite awhile. We had fun over dinner showing each other pictures of ourselves at the beginning of our hikes. We were all much fatter and much less scraggly. It's amazing to see the transformations. Most of the guys have lost 20-30 lbs. And we all have killer calf muscles! All in all, this ranks as one of the best days I've had on the trail.","Pine Ellis Hostel, Andover, ME

It was a quick 9.4 mile Nearo into the Hiker Hut in Rangely this morning. The climbs were minor and the weather was beautiful. I was the first one out of camp, so I got the honor of clearing the spider webs off the trail. Luckily, it wasn't too long before an early rising SOBO came from the other direction, having already cleared the spider webs for me. 
It also wasn't too long before Feathers and Wild Thing caught up with me. I tried to match their pace; but, I soon decided it wasn't worth risking injury to keep up. The group I have been traveling with this past couple of days planned to hitch into Rangely, resupply, and put in another eight miles. Feather invited me to come along; but, I decided my knees could really use a Nearo. Besides, although everyone in the group has been very nice to me, I'm not really part of their trail family (they even have a name - the Fellowship). I'm hoping the Nearo will give Sitting Bull, Hoops, Terminator, and Volunteer time to catch up. 
The Hiker Hut is 0.2 miles off the the trail and about 5 miles outside Rangely. It is also off the grid, which wasn't fully explained in the AWOL guide. As a result, there is no electricity (they have solar lights), plumbing (portajohn), indoor shower (there's a propane heated outdoor shower that uses water from the stream), or WIFI (use WIFI when you are in town). Not quite what I expected; but, it'll do. 
Steve, the proprietor, shuttled me into town, where I was able to get lunch, go to the library and print off a legal document Marguerite needed me to sign, go to the post office and find it closed, go next door to a stationery store and convince the proprietor to sell me an envelope and stamp, mail the letter, go to an outfitter store and replace a couple pieces of broken/worn out gear, and get ice cream. 
I am now waiting for Steve to pick me back up at 5:00 PM. We will stop at the IGA at the edge of town on the way back for resupply. Rangely is a quaint, sleepy little vacation town nestled between two lakes. Big doings tonight, though - a Clint Black concert. Apparently, everything in town is booked. 
When I get back to the Hiker Hut, I need to try to repair the outside mesh pockets on my  back pack. Our equipment is beginning to get tired, too. I just have to get to Mt Katahdin. I can then figure out what needs replaced before I finish the Virginia portion 
The other thru hikers sharing the trail with us NOBOs make an interesting study in contrasts. When the Flip Floppers started showing up north of Harper's Ferry, they were all new and squeaky clean. The ones who have survived to Maine are beginning to look like us NOBOs. Maybe not quite so weather worn; but they've made it almost halfway now, having survived the PA rocks and the White Mts.  
The first SOBOs we started seeing in Massachusetts also looked experienced and slightly weather worn. They had survived Katahdin, Maine, the Whites, and Vermud. However, whereas we've watched the Flip Floppers mature; the SOBOs are like Benjamin Button. The farther north we hike, the cleaner, shinier, and less experienced they become. They also lack the confidence that the first SOBOs we saw possessed because the haven't experienced the Whites or southern Maine yet. Whereas, the Flip Floppers are like our little brothers and sisters; the SOBOs are like distant cousins. We are definitely related, but we've grown up under different circumstances. 
Tomorrow, I will head back out in the morning and tackle the Saddleback range, which means more steep climbs and above treeline hiking. I think this Nearo will serve me well.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to

I was up and out and on the trail by 6:15 AM. The Huker Hut turned out to be a pretty cool place. I was a bit skeptical at first when I found out the place was off the grid. The whole point of going into town is to be on the grid. We've spent the majority of our days since late February off the grid. But Steve was such a nice man and so accommodating that it really wasn't an issue. 
We lucked out with the weather again. Another beautiful day.  I went over the Saddleback Range today, which included 4 miles above treeline, so it was especially fortunate that the weather held another day. I never tire of the views above treeline. It's just incredible. You feel like you are on top of the world. 
Although the Saddlebacks were fairly strenuous, for the most part the trail appears to be improving. I was able to pound out 18.7 miles, which hasn't happened since before the Whites. After the Crockers tomorrow and the Bigelows Tuesday, we should only have a few big mountains before Katahdin. It sounds like the treadway will continue to be rocky, rooty, and boggy though. 
The trail felt a little desolate today. I passed a few SOBOs; but, I didn't see any other NOBOs that I knew on the trail. The sense of desolation was heightened by passing Poplar Ridge Lean-to. On July 22, 2013, a NOBO thru hiker named Inchworm left this shelter and was never seen again. An extensive search for the retired nurse was undertaken; but, she was never found. 
In 2015, a land surveyor came across what was left of her tent in the woods a short distance from the shelter. Human remains, later confirmed to be her, were found in the tent, along with her personal effects, including her journal. 
According to her journal entries, she left the trail to relieve herself and got turned around and couldn't find the trail. She tried to climb to higher ground to get cell service and got hopelessly lost. She eventually set up her tent and waited for rescue. Rescue never came. Her final journal entries were from late August. 
As a trained Wilderness Search and Rescue volunteer and an AT devotee, I followed this case with interest at the time. Passing the actual spot where this took place was very sad and moving. Here was a thru hiker just like the rest of us who had been out here for months and was so close to the end. I'm sure she was ready to be done and longing to be home with her loved ones. Imagine the despair she must have experienced in the days before her death as waited in vain for someone to find her. 
As you can imagine, it kind of left a pall over the rest of the hike today. It also led me to decide to try to catch back up with Wild Thing, Feathers, and the rest of the Fellowship over the next couple of days. They are a nice group of people and I've enjoyed my time with them. They also plan to set a pace to finish by Aug 12. If I keep up this pace with them, I may be able to catch up to 1st Sgt before he summits Katahdin. 
When I arrived at the shelter, my friend J was here. He had stayed at the first shelter past Rangeley last night and had been just a little ahead of me all day. Eventually, Yogi, Bearslayer, 4 Wheel Drive, and five SOBOs arrived. It was nice to cook dinner and hang out with the other guys this evening. I'm sharing the shelter tonight with Yogi and Bearslayer. Everyone else is tenting nearby.
Tomorrow, I'm planning another 18+ mile day to Horns Pond Lean-tos. That will get me through the Crockers and up into the Bigelows. Let's hope the weather continues to hold...","Hiker Hut, Rangely, ME

Today was a fun and tough day on the trail. I was on the trail by 6:15 AM because I knew I had a long day with lots of climbing planned.  I once again awoke to clear skies and dry conditions, which was good because I started out immediately climbing over Spaulding Mt. The climb up and over Spaulding proved to be pretty tame. 
Likewise, the climb over Sugarloaf Mt wasn't too bad, since we didn't actually climb to the summit. The descent to the Carrabassett River proved to be a little steeper and rockier, though. At one point, I stepped on a rock which turned under my foot, sending me to the ground. I went down hard on a pointy rock on my left quad, causing a deep bruise. I expect it's going to be pretty stiff in the morning. 
I wish I could adequately describe the trail conditions in Maine. Words like rocky, rooty, and boggy don't adequately capture the true nature of the trail. It is the most physically demanding thing most of us have ever done. All of us take multiple spills every day. I am surprised that more people don't get seriously injured, to be quite honest. 
After crossing the river, I started the long and steep climb up South Crocker Mt. Part way up the mountain, I met up with Misplaced, a 30 year old woman I had previously camped with before. She's a member of the Fellowship and apparently got her name due to her penchant to lose things. We ended up hiking the rest of the afternoon together. It was fun to hike with someone else again. Our interesting conversation made the traverse of the Crocker Mts go a little faster. 
On the descent of North Crocker Mt, the sky decided to open up on us. It was a brief but hard shower that left us completely soaked. The road to Stratton, ME, sat at the bottom of the mountain. Misplaced was contemplating hitching the 5 miles into town and grab a burger and pick up a couple of things at the grocery. The problem was that we had already hiked over 13 miles and still had over five miles straight up the South Horn of Bigelow Mt to go. 
She decided that when she got to the road, if she could get a ride within five minutes, it was a sign she was supposed to go to town. Before we reached the road, she stepped into the woods for personal business and I continued on. When I reached the road, there was a man in a van dropping off two hikers. He asked if I needed ride to town. Score! I really hadn't planned to go to town; but, when someone offers you a ride, you don't pass it up. When Misplaced stepped out of the woods, I told her that she had gotten her sign. 
It was a quick ride to town. When we got there, the man had us sign our names on the side of his van with a Sharpie. Apparently, he just likes helping hikers. We then went to the White Wolf Inn and had second lunch, followed by a quick trip to the grocery, where we ran into Yogi and Bearslayer resupplying. 
I knew that getting back to the trail would not be a problem since I was hitching with Misplaced. As soon as she stuck out her thumb, a truck stopped for us. In many regards, thru hiking is more difficult for women; however, hitch hiking is one area where they have a decided advantage.
We were back to the trailhead before 5:00 PM. Our trip had been very efficient. When we reached the trail, we met up with Odin and 4 Wheel Drive, two other members of the Fellowship. They had just gotten caught in a hailstorm that we managed to miss while in town. 
The four of us then started the five mile climb to Horns Pond (I still haven't gotten used to the idea of ponds on top of mountains). The trail started out muddy, but mild. It soon went nearly vertical and the four of us started to spread out as some were stronger climbers than others (I wasn't at the front of the pack, if you were wondering). 
As I was huffing and puffing my way up the mountain, it occurred to me that I would never again be in a place in my life where I would be physically fit enough to hike over 13 miles, casually decide to hitch into town for lunch, and head back out and hike another 5.1 miles straight up the side of a big mountain. Was the climb up the South Horn of Bigelow Mt tough? Hell yeah, I was tough! But that's the point, we are all in such good shape, whether we are 20 or 60 years old, that we can hike like this. Unfortunately, this level of fitness is fleeting. When we return home and quit hiking 20 miles a day we will lose our hiker legs (and pulmonary system to go with them). 
I finally arrived at Horns Pond around 7:30 PM. Horns Pond actually had two lean-tos. I am in one lean-to with Odin, Yogi, Bearslayer, and a section hiker. The other lean-to has all the other members of the Fellowship. It was a tough day; but, a very good day. Tomorrow, we will finish off the Bigelows and pretty much be done with all the big mountains.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Today's hike took me over the Bigelow Mountains, with probably the best views since the Whites. Once again, we lucked out with the weather. The climb straight out of camp eventually took me above treeline. I love hiking above treeline!  After climbing and descending several peaks, I finally reached Avery Peak, named for Myron Avery, who was the driving force behind the construction of the AT. I caught up with Yogi and Bearslayer, who were lounging and taking in the views from Avery Peak. We knew that one of the mountains we were looking at on the horizon was Mt Katahdin. Unfortunately, we didn't know which one it was. Bummer. 
On the descent of Avery Peak, first Feathers, then Wild Thing passed me. They are such fast hikers I wasn't surprised to see them, even though they were still asleep when I left the lean-to this morning. After Avery Peak, the trail became pretty tame. It was still rocky and rooty; but, no longer steep. 
As I was descending Little Bigelow Mt, I came upon the first ripe blueberries I have seen all trip. As you can imagine, forward progress was greatly impeded! How can anyone walk past a blueberry bush just bursting with ripe berries?
The rest of the afternoon was a pleasant hike under glorious skies on flat, easy trail. Most of the Fellowship was making for the West Carry Pond Lean-to for the night. I pushed on another 3.6 miles to a stealth spot on East Carry Pond. 
Tomorrow, we have to cross the Kennebec River. There is a hydroelectric dam located upstream of the river crossing. The dam releases water at irregular intervals, causing the river to rise precipitously and unexpectedly. Hikers haves actually drowned in the past crossing this river because there is no bridge. As a result the Appalachian Trail Conservancy had put a ferry in place. 
The ferry is a canoe operated by a local outfitter. It is considered part of the trail and actually has a white blaze painted in the bottom. You wait in line and cross the river to two at a time. The problem is that the ferry only operates from 9 - 2 every day. If you get there after 2:00 PM, you are waiting until the next day to cross. My understanding is that you can be fined for fording the river on foot, if caught. 
Since the West Carry Pond Lean-to was located 14 miles from the ferry, I decided to hike on to East Carry Pond to reduce the distance I have to cover tomorrow. There were two or three stealth sites suggested in the guidebook. 
Of course, when I reached East Carry Pond the sites I was aiming for had already been taken. Argh! I hike on around the shore of the pond looking for somewhere else to camp. Unfortunately, the ground was very rough, rocky, and rooty. Eventually, I came upon a very nice spot right next to the pond. 
The pond was beautiful in the setting sun. I stepped into the water up to my ankles to wash the mud off my legs. I was expecting the water to be cold; but, it was actually quite warm. I was thinking about going for a swim when I looked more closely at the water and saw several black leaches about 4 inches long. Nope! No swim for me!
I am now in my tent, having had dinner, and been chased I. Here by the mosquitoes. Tomorrow I will get up early and head for the ferry. I should have plenty of time to reach it before 2:00 PM.","Horns Pond Lean-tos, ME

I got up and on the trail early this morning to be sure that I had time to make the ferry. It turns out the trail was quite easy this morning and I made it to the Kennebeck River by 10:30 AM. It was a beautiful morning and the trail was flat. 
As I passed Pierce Pond Lean-to, I came across Yogi and Bearslayer, who had hiked the ten miles from West Carry Pond Lean-to last night (I only made it an additional 3.6 miles past West Carry Pond Lean-to). They were planning to pass Caratunk today and do a 32 mile hike. 
As I passed Pierce Pond and stopped to take pictures of the loons, Feathers, who had started the day at West Carry Pond Lean-to, caught up to me. With my long legs, I had always considered myself to be a fairly fast hiker. I have learned out here that there are many, many faster hikers than me. Of course, most of them are 20-30 years younger. 
When I arrived at the Kennebeck River, there were about five people waiting to cross. The ferry, which is a canoe operated for the ATC by a local outfitter, takes two hikers across at a time. I crossed with Yogi. We waited on the north bank until Feathers, Wild Thing, Yogi, Grapenut, Bearslayer, and I all gathered. Then, we walked to the Caratunk B&B, where we all bought milkshakes. It's nearing the end of the hike and money is getting tight for some of the younger guys, so I may have bought an extra milkshake or two. 
After the milkshakes, I called the Sterling Inn and the shuttle came and picked me up. The Sterling Inn is a very nice place and it has been a very pleasant and restful day. My friends Misplaced, Giggles, Big Style, and Teabag also ended up here as the Caratunk B&B was full. 
We all went for pizza and have spent the evening watching movies. We first watched A Walk in the Woods and made fun of their equipment and clothes and the fact they have the trail all out of order. We are now watching Billy Elliot. Big Style and Teabag are British and really wanted us to watch it because it is set in the North of England at a turbulent time with a backdrop of labor unrest. 
Tomorrow, we will be back out there, most likely in the rain. Two more days will see us in Monson, then the 100 Mile Wilderness, followed by Mt Katahdin, most likely on or around August 12. It's amazing to realize how close we are to the end.","East Carry Pond Stealth Site, ME

Today was a pretty easy day on the trail. 18.8 miles; however, the majority of the hike was flat. We did climb Pleasant Pond Mt and Moxie Bald; but, compared to what we've been doing, the climbs were pretty tame. The hardest part of both mountains was tearing myself away from the ripe blueberries. 
I was on the trail before any of the other people staying at the Sterling Inn. As I left to get the shuttle back to the trailhead, Misplaced, Giggles, Big Style, and Teabag were just coming down to breakfast. It poured the rain last night, so the trail was a bit soft. Otherwise, it was smooth and flat, so I made good time. The sun even poked out from behind the clouds after awhile. All in all, it was a very pleasant morning's hike. Around 10:00 AM, on top of Pleasant Pond Mt, Feathers, Odin, Wild Thing, and the others started catching me one by one. 
As I was descending the mountain, dark clouds moved in and the thunder started rumbling. I made for Bald Mt Brook Lean-to, intending to wait out the state rm while I ate my lunch. I had a little rumbling and wind during lunch; but, by the time I was ready to move on, the sun was back out.  
Up and over a Moxie Bald. Eat more blueberries. A quick call to Marguerite - phone reception is getting pretty spotty. And reach camp for the evening. We are camped along Moxie Pond. I like camping along the ponds - they are always pleasant. We've all set up our tents under the trees next to the shoreline. We have about a dozen tents crammed onto any available flat spot. We all sat on flat rocks by the pond and ate dinner. It was a very pleasant evening. 
The lean-to is full of SOBOs. Since, at this point, they are just starting their hikes, they are hiking shorter days and reaching the shelters first. You can tell the difference between SOBOs and NOBOs at a glance. The SOBOs are, for the most part, thicker and fleshier, just like we were in March. At this point, any NOBOs left on the trail are thinner or even gaunt looking. 
Many of the NOBOs, especially the younger ones, look upon on the SOBOs with something akin to disdain. How quickly they forget what it was like for all of us at the beginning. For their part, just about every SOBO starts a conversation telling you how much more difficult a SOBO hike is than a NOBO hike. I guess it's a defense mechanism. They are still experiencing the doubt and insecurity we felt in Georgia and are wondering if they can do this. We have been through a long winnowing process and know that, short of catastrophic injury, we will be on Katahdin in a week. 
People are stupid. We are all out here doing the same thing (I think some people need to go back and read about Dr Seuss' Sneetches).  And it's not like it's some sort of noble pursuit, anyway. We are just walking, for God's sake! Anyway, I am now in my tent listening to coyotes and loons. It may not be noble, but it sure is cool!","Sterling Inn, Caratunk, ME

Due to jumping in and solving a potential crisis today, I became a full-fledged member of the Fellowship and earned the eternal gratitude of all the other members. 
I was up early and cranked out the miles - 17.9 miles by 1:15 pm. The route was fairly flat; but, still pretty rocky and rooty. We also had to ford two streams, which resulted in wet feet. I was the second to leave camp and, as usual, I was passed by just about everyone throughout the day.
 Everyone was stepping it out in order to get into Monson today and maximize the amount of time we had to prepare for the next week. Monson is the last town before Baxter State Park, home of Mt Katahdin. Between Monson and Baxter is the 100 Mile Wilderness. There are several private logging roads in the Wilderness, but that's about it. We have to carry food for the next week because there's nowhere else to resupply. 
I am staying at Shaw's Hostel today. It is one of the best known hostels on the trail due to its location. It is the last hostel the NOBOs pass and the first one the SOBOs pass. There are about 60 hikers here today. Once I got checked in and showered, I went shopping and bought supplies for the next six days. I hate carrying that much weight; but, there aren't many alternatives. 
After shopping, I stopped by the AT information center. Baxter State Park is the most popular park in Maine, as well as being the northern terminus of the AT. As a result, the park is being loved to death. The State of Maine has put a lot of regulations in place to control the crowds. The AT information center had a lot of information about these regulations. This is where the crisis came to light.  
The Fellowship plans to summit Mt Katahdin next Saturday. Weekends are especially busy at Baxter due to a huge influx of day hikers. Odin's girlfriend Amy is renting a 12 person van and planned to park at Baxter, summit with the group, and drive the group to a nearby cabin afterward. When I started talking to the woman at the information center I found out that the Birches Campground, which is reserved for thru hikers, only has 12 spots and all the other campgrounds in Baxter are all booked up. So, there is nowhere for a group that large to stay Friday night. She also said that there are no parking spaces available in the entire park next Saturday, so Amy would not be able to enter the park, much less park the van. 
I conveyed this information to the group and, of course, panic set in. I went into crisis aversion mode and started calling around. After a lot of time spent on the the phone and talking to group members, I was able to broker a deal with the Wilderness Edge Campground in Millinocket, where they will pick us up Friday evening at Baxter State Park, take us to their campground for the night, return us to Baxter in the morning to summit Katahdin, and pick us up Saturday evening. I also ended up putting the cost of the whole thing on my credit card after getting everyone's buy-in on the plan. 
Everyone was overjoyed that a potentially messy end to a very long hike was averted. I was immediately and unanimously voted a full member of the Fellowship and was invited to the post-hike Party Cabin.  The timing is actually perfect. Hiking by committee gets very cumbersome when everyone negotiates how far we are going to hike tomorrow, etc. It's sort of the antithesis of ""Hike Your Own Hike"" and part of the reason I did not stick with Darwin & Co way back in NC. However, with only a week left in the hike and a summit day already chosen, there isn't much negotiation. The days are pretty much set. So, it gives me a group to hike with through the 100 Mile Wilderness without my hike getting hijacked by a committee. By the way, everyone has already paid for their portion of the bill. 
It was a very hectic day; but, I managed to get all my chores done. Tomorrow, we will head into the 100 Mile Wilderness. Due to its remoteness, I will probably have pretty limited cell phone service. So, don't be surprised if I don't post regular updates for the next week. I will continue to write updates nightly, though, and will post them as soon as possible. 
After I summit next Saturday, I will catch a flight home (missing the post-hike partying), see an eclipse, go to a wedding, and head back out August 27 to complete the portion of the Virginia AT that I missed while moving back in April. The adventure isn't nearly over...","Moxie Bald Lean-to, ME

The skies opened up shortly after going to bed and it poured most of the night. I stayed dry in my tent. The end of my quilt was slightly damp, otherwise, I was good. Some of the others weren't so lucky, with varying degrees of wetness. The We awoke to overcast skies, which stayed with us most of the day. The sun occasionally peaked out; but, generally, it was overcast and blustery until evening, when the skies finally cleared. 
The Fellowship had agreed to head out at 8:00 AM. I get the impression that they generally hike their own hikes during the day and head out whenever they get ready in the mornings. However, I think with the approaching end of the hike, many of them are hiking as a group, enjoying as much time together as possible. I headed out around 7:30 AM because I knew that I couldn't match their pace and they would all soon be passing me. 
Today's hike turned out to be pretty tough! It's as if Maine is reminding us that we aren't done yet. We climbed up and over Barren Mountain and the Chairback Range, which includes Fourth Mt, Mt Three and a Half, Third Mt, Columbus Mt, and Chairback Mt. None of the climbs were overly tough; however, the combined up and down of all the peaks wore me out. 
It was nice to climb back up on the ridge tops, though. That's where you get the incredible views. It's amazing to look out and see nothing but wilderness - no roads, no houses, no power lines. And the ponds are incredible! Huge ponds everywhere that do not appear to have been touched by people. - no boats, no piers, or any other evidence of humans. 
I hiked on and off with various members of the Fellowship throughout the day. Generally, I hiked alone; but, someone would take a snack break or stop to look at a view and I would catch up. We would then hike together for awhile.  I had lunch with Odin and Big Style atop Fourth Mt, where I laid out my tent and sleeping pad to dry while I ate. 
I spent the afternoon climbing and descending over the remainder of the mountains. I finally arrived at East Chairback Pond, where we had decided to camp for the evening, around 5:20 PM. By this time, the clouds had cleared, leaving sunny skies and cooler temperatures. After setting up my tent, I fixed dinner with everyone else.
 After dinner, I decided that a cup of tea was in order to help ward off the evening chill. Odin and Big Style decided that a hot cuppa sounded pretty good too. We took our tea to the rocks on the pond and watched a pair of loons fishing while the sun slowly set over the pond. It was a magical moment - a 53 year old guy sitting there with a 25 year old American kid and a 19 year old British kid, sipping tea. At that moment, we were just three thru hikers enjoying the evening after hiking a tough section of trail. We are all ready to be done with the trail; but, this moment wasn't lost on any of us. We realized what a special space out of time this was and that we would really miss moments like these when we all returned to our regular lives. 
I have really enjoyed the brief time I have spent with the Fellowship. They are a great bunch of kids. Actually, they aren't all kids. 4WD is a 50-something Hungarian man now living in FL. Wild Thing is a 45 year old school teacher from Stratford Upon Avon. He teaches 3rd and 4th grade. Misplaced is a 30 year old woman who has been working in a corporate office for a restaurant chain. All the rest are 20-somethings. Giggles and her brother Waldo, Feathers, Odin, and Scout (all guys) are Americans. Big Style and his friend Teabag are both British guys. 
We have one more tough day of climbing tomorrow over Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay and White Cap Mountains. We are supposed to be able to see Mt Katahdin from White Cap Mt. We are all very excited about the prospect of finally seeing Mt Katahdin. After tomorrow, Maine finally gives us a break and it is a pretty flat and mellow trail the rest of the way.","Long Pond Brook Stealth Site, ME

After a big breakfast at Shaw's, we entered the 100 Mile Wilderness. The name sounds very ominous and remote, like you're entering the deep, dark forest. There is even a warning sign as you enter telling you to carry a minimum of 10 days of supplies and to not underestimate the difficulty of his section. In actuality, it's the same old rocky, rooty, muddy AT we've been hiking all through Maine. Instead of 40 miles between towns, it's 100 miles. 
We hiked under overcast skies with the threat of rain all day. The whole group started out together after being dropped off by the shuttle; but, started to spread out a little as we walked. I hiked most of the morning with Odin and 4WD. 
We caught up with the rest of the group when we all stopped for lunch at Little Wilson Falls. I hiked mainly by myself the rest of the afternoon; however, I would catch back up every couple miles at the numerous stream fords. We crossed several streams that were too deep to rock hop. So, we'd all stop, remove our shoes, wade across, and put our shoes back on. This is a fairly time consuming process; but, I appeared to be faster at it than most of the group. I have actually had extensive stream fording experience with my years of hiking around WV. As a result, I would generally pass the group at the stream and they would all pass me again over the next couple of miles. 
We had planned to stop for the night at Long Pond Stream Lean-to; however, SOBOs who had passed through there said there was not good water at the shelter and that we'd have to carry it 0.8 miles from Long Pond Stream, along with enough extra water to get us through the next ten miles, which also didn't have any water. In addition, the guidebook said there were very few tent sites at this shelter. 
Since the guidebook mentioned several good tent sites next to Long Pond Stream, we decided to stop 0.8 miles short of the shelter and camp by the stream. It was a bit of a short day; however, since our packs are so heavy with extra food, no one minded stopping early. 
Misplaced really wanted a fire tonight, so she gathered wood and started a fire. Pretty soon everyone gathered around the fire. It wasn't long until the reminiscences started. Everyone is beginning to feel acutely the approaching end of the hike. Even though we are all ready to be done, there is a certain sadness at the thought off the hike ending. 
The rain that had been threatening all day finally arrived. So, we all retired to our tents. I am now all snug and dry in my tent listening to the rain. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Shaw's Hostel, Monson, ME

Today's hike turned out to be way easier than I expected, for once. I was up and on the trail by 7:15 AM under sunny skies. Wild Thing and Feathers headed out about the same time. I was able to keep up with them for the first mile and a half because it was a gentle downhill with smooth trail. 
We forded the Pleasant River and started climbing. That was the end of hiking with Wild Thing and Feathers. The rest of the crew passed me throughout the day.
 We were climbing over four peaks today, including 3650 ft Whitecap Mt, so I expected the day to be pretty tough. It turns out we were on probably the best trail we've seen in Maine. There were still roots and rocks; but, there was more smooth dirt trail. And there were rock steps over many of the steeper portions. And switchbacks! We haven't seen switchbacks for hundreds of miles. As a result, the climbs over Gulf Hagas, West Peak, and Hay Mts were actually pleasant. 
Going over Gulf Hagas Mt, I saw more moose poop than I've seen on the rest of the trail combined. Tons of moose poop! Of course, no moose. I'm beginning to think I'm going to finish this hike without seeing a moose. That makes me sad. 
The weather for hiking was absolutely perfect. It was cool, sunny, and breezy. Since we were only going 14.6 miles today and the trail turned out to be so pleasant, I sort of dawdled and enjoyed the hike. 
Even the climb up Whitecap Mt turned out to be pretty mellow. The other peaks were tree covered, so I didn't have any views until Whitecap Mt, where I finally got above treeline. 
As I came around to the north side of the mountain, the hum in the back of my mind that has been slowly growing swelled into a full chorus. There it was - Mt Katahdin!  I stood there for quite awhile looking at it. Even though it is still 70 trail miles away, it looked big! After hiking since February, it was reassuring to see that the mountain actually existed. 
Another quick 1.4 mile hike brought me to the Logan Brook Lean-to. It was nice to get into camp a little early and have some time to relax before I had to dive into my camp chores. The whole group sat around a fire cooking dinner and talking. It was a very pleasant evening. I am now in my tent and ready for a twenty mile, mostly flat hike tomorrow.","Long Pond Brook Stealth Site, ME

Today's hike was another easy one. 19.6 miles of mostly flat or downhill trail. It rained most of the night and I slept in a little waiting for it to stop. As a result, I wasn't on trail until 7:40 AM. Even the bough we had longer miles planned, I wasn't worried about the later start because I knew the miles would go pretty quickly. 
As usual, I was passed by most of the others in short order; but, I would catch up when they would stop for breaks. I hiked at various times with Giggles, Misplaced, and 4WD, who tend to hike closer to my pace. 
We did climb one small mountain, Little Boardman Mountain; but, the rest of the day was flat. For the most part, the trail conditions were good, too. We did have some rocky and rooty sections; but, the trail was generally smooth. 
The only bad thing today was the mosquitoes. I finally had to break down and pull out the DEET for the first time this entire trip. The only thing I hate worse than DEET is getting swarmed by mosquitoes. 
Generally, I don't have problems with mosquitoes. When everyone else is getting eaten alive, they usually leave me alone. I think it's because I have a reputation in the mosquito world. You see, when I was in college, I worked two summers as a Vector Control Technician. Basically, I drove around in a pick up truck spewing malathion into the air, leaving millions of dead mosquitoes in my wake. I imagine the mosquito parents use me to scare their children - ""If you don't drink that blood and grow into a strong mosquito, then the Vector Control Technician will get you!"" Not Maine mosquitoes though! They are mean little blood suckers. 
I got into camp around 4:00 PM. The skies had cleared during the afternoon and the Antlers Campsite is located on a peninsula jutting into Lower Jo-Mary Lake, so it was a beautiful setting. 4WD built a fire and the Fellowship gathered and cooked dinner together. We all went a little light on food since we had to carry six days' worth. So, we are all beginning to get a little hungry and are looking forward to getting to Abol Bridge on Thursday where we can get real food again. 
We have a big day planned tomorrow - 23.4 miles to Rainbow Lake Dam, where we should get excellent views of Mt Katahdin. I plan to be up and on the trail early tomorrow, so goodnight from the AT!","Logan Brook Lean-to

Last night, after posting my blog and going to sleep for a bit, I was awakened by the bright light from the full moon shining in my tent. I decided to get up and look at the moon rising over the pond. 
As I walked down to the shore of the pond, I realized that Odin, Big Style, and Teabag were still sitting by the fire. They were waiting to see the Persied Meteor Shower. It turned out the moon was too bright to see them; however, I hung out for awhile by the fire. 
As has been the case every evening this week, we started reminiscing about the trail. We all had our journals (mine on my phone, the others' on paper), so we started picking random days and everyone would read their entries. After several different days, someone suggested three days ago. That was the evening that I had sat on the shore of the pond with Odin and Big Style drinking tea and watching the loons. 
Two things struck me about our entries from that day. First, in fine British form, Big Style described me as a ""lovely man"", which really touched me. Second, we all three commented on what a special experience it was. I was glad to see that they both felt it was as special as I did. I thought maybe I was just being a sentimental old man.  
Today was another good day on the trail. We awoke to clear skies and dry trail. We had a 21.7 mile day planned, so I got up early and was on trail by 6:15 AM to get a head start on the group. The majority of the trail was flat today, so I made good time. I didn't even fight it this morning. I immediately applied DEET to keep the swarming mosquitoes away. 
It was a couple hours before the Feathers and Wild Thing Express came chugging past me, with Scout close behind. I came upon them taking a break a short while later and stopped to visit with them for a bit before we started back up and they soon left me in the dust. 
I passed several people on the trail today, going both north and south. I had imagined the 100 Mile Wilderness as a remote, desolate section of trail. It turns out that the closer we get to Baxter State Park, home of Mt Katahdin, the more crowded the trail is getting, with NOBOs, SOBOs, section hikers, day hikers, and various hiking groups. 
We hiked for several miles this morning along the shores of Nahmakanta Lake (for some reason, the past couple of ponds have been called lakes). It's huge and beautiful, with several sand beaches.  The ponds have been my favorite part of hiking in Maine. 
As I was passing one beach, I heard Wild Thing call my name. He, Feathers, and Scout decided to have lunch on the beach rather than at the next shelter, as planned. I joined them on the beach. The water was so inviting that, after checking for leaches, we went for a swim. It was wonderful to rinse the accumulated dirt, sweat, bug spray, and grime off of my body. After swimming, we sat on the beach soaking up the sun. Feathers had The Beach Boys on his playlist on his phone, so we even had beach music. It was another of those special moments that will stick in my memory. I have really enjoyed hiking with the Fellowship the past few days. 
After our beach party, we got back on the trail and immediately started climbing Nesuntabunt Mountain. Of course, the other three quickly left me behind on the climb. This was our last mountain before Mt Katahdin. Luckily, the climb wasn't too bad, although Waldo and Teabag did blow past me on the climb. At the summit, we got a good view of Mt Katahdin, which was 16 miles away as the crow flies but still over 30 winding trail miles away. 
Although the swim and sun had invigorated me for the climb, I soon found my energy flagging. I still had over six miles to hike and, as Wild Thing would say, I was ""totally nackered"". I think the cumulated fatigue of several days on trail without a break, combined with a caloric deficit due to having to carry several days' worth of food leading to smaller meals, has finally begun to catch up with me. 
Luckily, we will have a shorter, relatively flat 15 mile hike to Abol Bridge tomorrow, where there is a restaurant and convenience store where we can calorie load. We are all low on food and are actually more excited about Abol Bridge than Katahdin at this point. 
We are camped at Rainbow Stream Lean-to tonight. It looks like a tent city. There must be 30 people here tonight. I'm hoping we will be able to get a spot at one of the two campgrounds at Abol Bridge tomorrow.","Antlers Campsite, ME

I was up and out of camp by 6:00 AM to hike the 14.9 miles into Abol Bridge for lunch. Wild Thing, Feathers, and Teabag left at the same time and I never saw them again. We had heard that the trail today was muddy and boggy, so I wanted to have time to make it through the last of the 100 Mile Wilderness and still reach Abol Bridge by lunchtime. 
As is often the case, the description of the trail was overblown. There were a few muddy sections; but, in general, the trail was quite mellow. There was only one small climb to Rainbow Ledges, where I had a beautiful view of Mt Katahdin. I was glad to see that the summit was absolutely clear and cloudless because I knew that 1st Sgt was up there working his way to the summit today. I hope it stayed clear for him. 
I knocked down the hike by 11:30 AM and made it to the Abol Bridge campground, where there was a restaurant and convenience store. I had fried chicken for lunch and ice cream for dessert - a good start at knocking down the caloric deficit. 
There are two campgrounds at Abol Bridge. They are both full. Abol Bridge abuts up to the boundary of Baxter State Park , where you can only camp in designated campsites, all of which are over 10 miles away. Luckily, the Gutthooks App listed a stealth site just outside the park that turned out to be perfect. We set up a nice little tent city under the power lines about 0.2 miles from the campground. 
Wild Thing, 4WD, and I went back to the restaurant for dinner. One of the advantages of doing this hike as an older hiker is that we have more disposable income than the kids, who all ate dinner at the stealth camp. As we ate dinner, more and more thru hikers continued to emerge from the 100 Mile Wilderness. By the time we returned to our tent city, it had swelled to close to 20 tents. We are still ahead of the Bubble. I can't imagine what this place will look like in two weeks.  
Baxter State Park is too small and remote to handle the huge influx of thru hikers it has seen in the past few years. Especially when you consider that thru hikers are only a small portion of the people who visit Baxter.  They are doing their best to handle the crowds in the most equitable manner possible. For example, they provide a small campground, called the Birches, exclusively for summiting thru hikers. However, it can only accommodate 12 hikers, which is why I had to scramble last weekend to make arrangements for the Fellowship last weekend before we entered the 100 Mile Wilderness. 
I suspect that we will see the northern terminus of the AT moving in the next few years. I'm glad I was able to do the hike while Katahdin is still the climax of the journey. 
Tomorrow, we have a short, sweet, 10 mile hike through Baxter State Park to Katahdin Stream Campground, where we will apply for our thru hiker permits at the Ranger station to hike up Mt Katahdin on Saturday. We then will catch a shuttle to Wilderness Edge Campground in Millinocket and prepare for our summit on Saturday. Woo hoo!","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Today's hike was only 9.9 miles of relatively flat, smooth trail to the Ranger station at Katahdin Stream Campground. I was up and on my way by 6:20 AM. Even though I took my time and leisurely hiked, the hike went pretty fast and I arrived at the Ranger Station by a little after 10:00 AM. 
I was the first one out and kept my eyes peeled for a moose; but, alas and alack, no moose. I fear I'm going to end this hike mooseless. At one point, as I was nearing the end of the hike, I heard the inevitable voices of approaching young hikers. It was time for me to get passed by the other hikers. I could hear them talking about mooses and calling for them. So, I decided to step off into the brush and crash around and make moose snorting noises. I heard them stop and start to approach cautiously, talking about a moose in the underbrush. 
As they came around the turn in the trail, I could see they were indeed young thru hikers. The only problem was that they were not my young thru hikers. In fact, I didn't know these thru hikers at all. They said, ""You're not a moose! We thought you were a moose!""  To which I replied, ""You're not my friends! I thought you were my friends!""  Oh well. They laughed it off and kept on hiking as if it was an everyday occurrence to come upon a gray haired man in a kilt in the middle of the woods pretending to be a moose.  I guess after hiking close to 2200 miles not much phases you anymore. 
I arrived at the Ranger station and got my permit to summit Mt Katahdin tomorrow. I'm glad we didn't go up today since a thunderstorm arrived just after I did. The summit of Mt Katahdin is 5267 ft in elevation and much of the trail is above treeline - not the place to be in a thunderstorm!
The rest of the Fellowship arrived shortly thereafter and obtained their permits. We then waited for the shuttle to arrive at 1:00 PM. Soon we were on our way out of Baxter State Park and arrived shortly at Wilderness Edge Campground. We promptly showered and caught a ride to town to eat. We assured them that we would find our own way back to the campground and set about eating and buying snacks for our hike up Katahdin. 
Wild Thing was able to secure us a ride back to the campground in the back of a pickup truck. The rest of the afternoon was spent doing chores like laundry and getting ready for tomorrow's hike. 
I'm now in my tent and getting ready to go to sleep. We are meeting at the campground office at 5:00 AM for the ride back to  a Ter State Park. We are hoping to be on the trail as early as possible. We hope to summit and be on our way back down by early afternoon to best any potential afternoon thunderstorms. After months of hiking through rain, sleet, snow, wind, and blistering sun, it still doesn't quite seem real that we will be standing on the summit of Mt Katahdin tomorrow.

I was up at 4:00 AM to get ready for my summit of Mt Katahdin. I actually slept much better last night than I expected and felt pretty rested when I got up. The Fellowship all met at the campground office at 5:00 AM and headed to Baxter State Park in three shuttle vehicles. The gate to the park didn't open until 6:00 AM; however, we left early so we would be near the front of the line. It was incredible. We arrived at about 5:25 AM and there were already about 10 cars in line ahead of us. As we sat there, the line behind us got longer and longer. 
It was about 7:00 AM when we finally got to the trail head at Katahdin Stream Campground and were ready to head out. Unfortunately, it wasn't a pretty day to summit. Light rain was falling and the mountain was in the clouds. Oh well. One thing I've learned out here is that you make accommodations for the weather because it won't accommodate you. 
As I got out of the shuttle car, who should I see but Sitting Bull and Hoops! They pushed hard and made it into Baxter State Park last night to summit on the 12th. Yay! It was great to see them again. 
I also saw a young friend of mine named Alex, who I first met hiking with his dad and his dog Springer way back before Low Gap, GA, on the second or third day of the hike. I had run into Alex again at Shaw's in Monson last week for the first time since Hot Springs, NC. 
When I last saw Alex in Hot Springs, he seemed like a clean cut, scrawny high school kid. He was 17 and had graduated high school early. He was a bit nervous because his dad was about to go home and he would be continuing on alone. When I saw him again in Monson, he was now Billy Goat the thru hiker, who was pounding out 32 mile days with the likes of Juggernaut and Highlander. He was muscular and had long hair and a goatee, with this air of self-confidence that made him seem 10 years older. It was really cool to see the transition. 
Now Alex (aka Billy Goat) was back at Katahdin. He had summited yesterday with his trail buddies; but, he returned today to hike to the summit with his dad and cousin. It was fun to be going to the summit with people I knew from way back at the beginning of this Grand Adventure. 
Sitting Bull and Hoops were still getting their stuff organized for the hike to the summit, so I told them I'd see them at the top and headed out with the rest of the Fellowship. The plan was for the Fellowship to hike to the top as a group; however, excitement and adrenaline took over and soon the rest of the group left me, along with 4WD, Odin, and his girlfriend Amy, behind. I was hiking faster than the other three, so I was soon hiking alone. Actually, ""alone"" is a bit of a misnomer. There was a steady stream of hikers, both thru hikers and day hikers, making its way up the mountain. 
The hike was steep and rocky. As we neared the treeline, the rain stopped; however, we also hiked into the cloud encircling the summit. Soon, visibility was down to 20 feet and the rest of the world was lost to the fog. I continued to climb ever upward and soon found myself climbing hand over hand up vertical rock sections, with occasional rebar steps to help with the tougher sections. As the wind picked up, I had to stop and put on my rain jacket for warmth. 
I continued to climb and rock scramble for what seemed like an eternity, using my hands as much as my feet in many sections. With such limited visibility, I had no visual cues and could not gauge my progress. I eventually reached the Tablelands and the trail leveled off somewhat. At least I could once again be a biped rather than a quadruped. 
I reached Thoreau Spring and had only another mile to go. I was still in white out conditions with only about 20 feet visibility. The wind carried away any sound, so I had no idea how close I was to the summit. Soon. I could start to make out forms ahead and I could hear people cheering and calling my name. Then, suddenly, there was that iconic sign I had been waiting to see since February. Soon, the other members of the Fellowship were hugging me and pounding me on the back. 
It was cold, wet, and blustery at the summit; but, it didn't matter. It was Mt Katahdin and I was surrounded by a bunch of people who had become good friends over the past couple of weeks. Who needed sunshine? Feathers took a bunch of pictures of me on the summit sign. 
While we waited for 4WD, Odin, and Amy, I broke out the Cadbury Chocolate bars I had carried up the mountain and passed them around to cheers of gratitude. As other thru hikers arrived, we would break into spontaneous cheers for them.  Soon, Sitting Bull and Hoops arrived and we took a bunch more pictures. Shortly thereafter, Billy Goat and his dad and cousin arrived. 
Before long, 4WD, followed shortly by Odin and Amy, arrived. The celebrations erupted anew with each new arrival. After several more pictures of the whole group, we were ready to head back down to where it was warmer and drier. 
I hiked down the mountain most of the way with Billy Goat's dad, Jerome. We had a pleasant conversation about the hike in general and reminisced about the early days when we hiked together in Georgia. As we descended, the clouds began to disperse and we could see just how exposed the rock face really was. Wow! What a difference to the ascent in the clouds. 
After what seemed like forever, we finally neared the bottom of the descent. Sitting Bull and Hoops passed me one last time, as they had done on countless days throughout this hike. At the bottom, we waited for the shuttle and eventually arrived back at the Wilderness Edge Campground. 
The rest of the Fellowship was planning to head to Odin's cabin in Maine for a day or two of post-hike celebration; however, I was scheduled to fly home tomorrow, so I had a hotel room in town. The owner of the campground was running two other hikers to town and offered to give me a ride. They were leaving right then, so suddenly I was saying rushed farewells to the Fellowship and running to grab my pack. As a final farewell gift, I got one of Giggles' coveted Friendship Bracelets. She has been making them for members of the Fellowship the past couple of weeks and everyone has been waiting to get theirs. Since I was leaving before everyone at the cabin, I got mine before a couple of others. 
All of a sudden, I am in a hotel room alone. I am safe, warm, dry, and clean. It feels weird. I have been working toward this goal for months and now it's done. By this time tomorrow, I will be home. I haven't had time to fully reflect on the hike yet. That'll come with time. Not to mention, I'm not done yet. I have 317.9 miles to complete in VA. I will be back on the AT August 27, after a couple weeks of R&R. Be sure and join me for the next chapter...","Wilderness Edge Campground, Millinocket, ME

Annddd.....I'm back!! After a two week rest at home, it's time to knock this hike down. ""Rest"" is a bit of a misnomer. It was actually a busy two weeks. The trip home from Millinockett was long but uneventful. Two regional bus rides got me to Bangor and then on to Portland, where I caught a flight to Atlanta and then on to Knoxville, arriving home around around 1:00 AM. 
We are adding a master bedroom suite onto our house in Knoxville, so Marguerite and I spent the first couple of days picking out such things as faucets, sinks, and countertops. Then came the eclipse. 
We were located just north of the path of totality, so we had family come visit from NJ to see the eclipse. We traveled with Rick and Debbie Bland to Sweetwater, TN, about an hour's drive south of Knoxville, to view the eclipse. It was one of the most spectacular natural phenomena I have ever experienced! It was well worth the three hour traffic jam we endured to get home afterward. 
After the eclipse came the job interviews. I interviewed with two local ambulance services for a full time paramedic position when I return from the trail in mid-September. Both interviews went quite well. I have been offered a position at one service already and am expecting a formal offer from the other in the next day or two. 
Then, after the job interviews came the wedding. Marguerite and I drove to Columbus, OH, on Friday for the wedding of Daniel Rine (son of Lisa and GARY RINE) and Joely Henriquez. It was a fun affair, with much dancing, laughter, general merry-making, and time spent with family. 
This morning, Marguerite dropped me off at the Columbus airport for a flight to Charlottesville, VA. My son, Zack, picked me up at the airport in Charlottesville, where we had dinner at a Thai restaurant before he delivered me to Rockfish Gap. 
Although I'm ready to be done with my thru hike and return to normal life, slipping on the backpack and stepping onto the trail at Rockfish Gap just felt right - like putting on a comfortable pair of old jeans. Its kind of fun to still be a thru hiker. I have talked to several of my thru hiker friends since summiting Katahdin and most of them are missing the trail already - maybe not the long days hiking and sore feet, but the community of like-minded people who don't think you are crazy for wanting to walk 2200 miles. I get to experience that feeling of belonging and inclusion for just a little while longer. 
I had walked less than a mile when I felt a pop and the left side of my backpack slid off my back. I stopped and removed my backpack and examined it to figure out what had happened. It turns out that the left shoulder strap had worn through about an inch above where it is attached to the body of the pack. Bummer!
With no way to fix it on the trail, my only option was to call Zack to come back and pick me up. He drove me to Waynesboro and dropped me off at Stanimal's 328 Hostel. It is a very nice hostel In the basement of a house of a former thru hiker. I have the whole place to myself tonight. In the morning, the owner will shuttle me to a tailor to get the pack strap repaired or to an outfitter to get the pack replaced. I'm hoping for the former (cheaper) option. 
This is a fairly inauspicious beginning to this last segment of my hike; however, at least the strap did not break when I was two days' hike from a town. Hopefully, I can get it repaired and be on my way late morning tomorrow.","Columbus, OH

I ended up being the only guest at Stanimal's 328 Hostel last night. I wrote my blog, watched a movie called The Way, and went to bed. This morning I just hung out until the businesses in town opened up. I had identified a tailor who could probably sew the pack strap for me; but, Adam, the proprietor of Stanimal's suggested we go to Rockfish Gap Outfitters first. 
RGO is an authorized Osprey Packs dealer. Adam thought they might be able to talk to Osprey and see if anything could be done (my pack is an Osprey Exos 58). Osprey offers a pretty amazing guarantee. Jack from RGO got on the phone with Osprey and 15 minutes later I was walking out the front door with a brand new replacement pack. Woo hoo! They, of course, earned my customer loyalty with that one. 
Adam dropped me back off at Rockfish Gap, where I packed my new pack and hit the trail by 11:00 AM. I was back on the trail much earlier than I had expected; however, it was a pretty late start for the 20.8 mile day I had planned to make up for the lost miles yesterday. Fortunately, the trail was like the AT Superhighway! It was smooth, dry, rockless, and rootless. And - oh my God - the switchbacks! The switchbacks were fat and juicy and wound their way back and forth up the mountain. So much so, in fact, that at a couple of points I pointed out to the Trail that if it didn't wind quite so much, we could be at the top of the mountain much faster. It just chuckled good-naturedly and kept winding its way up the mountain. 
I saw several day hikers out on the trail and a Freshman Orientation group from Washington & Lee University; but, not many thru hikers. I think I may be slightly ahead of most SOBOs and slightly behind most Flip Floppers. I continued to see day hikers until I summited Humpback Mt. Then, I pretty much had the trail to myself. Unfortunately, with the summit of Humpback Mt, my gentle re-introduction to the AT ended. All of a sudden, I was back on rocky trail. And it was those loose rocks that derive a perverse pleasure out of twisting under your feet. As a result, by late afternoon, my feet, ankles, and knees were really feeling it. 
Due to my late start, I did not arrive at the shelter until about 8:15 PM. It was getting pretty dark up under the trees by then; however, I've learned over the years that if you don't turn on a flashlight, your eyes adjust to the slowly fading light quite well and you can see well enough to hike almost until it is pitch dark. 
When I arrived at the shelter, I think I startled a couple of the people when a kilted figure silently materialized out of the dark. There were five other people already here when I arrived. It turns out that I had actually met two of the hikers - Intrepid (SOBO) and GI Joe (Flipper) in July in NH - and we actually remembered one another! That was pretty cool!
It is now almost 10:00 PM. A front is moving in, so it is pretty blustery. We are expecting rain overnight, so I chose to sleep in the shelter tonight to keep my equipment dry. I hope it's not a rainy day tomorrow...","Stanimal's 328 Hostel, Waynesboro, VA

The rain arrived around 4:00 AM. It rained really hard, so I was glad to be in the shelter. I would wake up every hour or so to find that it was still pouring, so I'd go back to sleep. Finally, around 8:30 AM, I had to get up to answer Nature's call. It was still pouring. 
After taking care of business, I started packing up to head out. By 9:15 AM the rain had let up a little, so I headed out. Even though it was still raining, I soon had to shed my rain jacket as I was beginning to get pretty hot climbing up Three Ridges. 
Two things surprised me today. First, I was surprised to find I had very little phone signal. I had better signal in the 100 Mile Wilderness! Second, the trail was much rockier than I expected. And, of course, the rocks were wet and very slick. In fact, I took a pretty good tumble coming down Three Ridges and banged up my right knee pretty badly.
I stopped at Harper's Creek Shelter around 12:30 PM for lunch and to get out of the rain for a bit. I met a man named Bill who was hiking north and just hadn't been able to get into gear and step it out into the rain. I did find out from him that my Flip Flopper friends Sauce and Keller, who I haven't seen since Massachusetts, are just a couple of days ahead of me. I'm not sure if I'll catch them; but, it would be great to see them again. 
After lunch, I crossed the Tye River and started the long climb up The Priest. It was the first 4000 footer I've climbed since Katahdin. . It was a 3000+ foot climb over 4.5 miles. It went on and on. And on. I just put my head down and kept climbing. At least the trail had calmed down and the rocks went away. Of course, the higher I climbed, the blusterier the weather got. It was just a nasty day to be out in the woods hiking. 
I finally summited The Priest in the fog and rain and arrived at the Priest Shelter. It was about 4:30 PM and the shelter was full with another Freshman Orientation group from Washington & Lee, so I decided to push on another 6.6 miles to the Seely-Woolworth Shelter. The rain had finally tapered off; but, a fog had settled in and the trees continued to drip water. At one point, I came across an old apple orchard. The trees were groaning under the weight of tons of apples. I helped myself to several apples. They were wonderful! It's so hard to get fresh fruit out here. 
I finally arrived at the shelter around 7:30 PM to find five people already in the shelter. They invited me to join them in the six person shelter; but, I decided to set up my tent instead. I am now snug, warm, and dry in my tent. The rain has stopped for now; but, more rain is predicted for tomorrow. I am so tired of hiking in rain.","Maupin Field Shelter, VA

Today rated up pretty high on my list of Good Days on the AT. I awoke around 6:00 AM to find that it was still dark. This has been hard to get used to. Where we were so much farther north in Maine, I was used to it getting light before 5:00 AM. Even though I got up, ate breakfast, and started packing up, it wasn't fully light until after 7:00 AM. As a result, I didn't get on trail until almost 7:30 AM. 
I had hoped to get started earlier because I had a 25.3 mile day planned, setting me up for a 10 mile Nearo into Glasgow tomorrow. The rain had passed overnight; however, the morning was very foggy and drippy. That was OK though because it looked like, once the fog burned off, we would have a pretty day. 
The trail through this section was beautiful - smooth, packed dirt undulating along the ridges. These are the kinds of conditions that make for great hiking. You can fly down the trail without having to watch every step, allowing you to eat up the miles. 
To make matters even better, the trail ran through old farmland, with lots of heavily laden apple trees. As my wife will tell you, I love apples. They are my favorite fruit. Despite my wife's admonitions not to eat too many apples, I couldn't walk past those trees without sampling an apple. Or two. Or three. Or more...
The sun finally broke out and the mist burned off around 11:00 AM, making the hike even more pleasant. I stopped for lunch around 1:00 PM (and 15 miles) at a wayside picnic area where the AT crossed US Rt 60. I laid out my tent and other damp equipment to dry while I ate my lunch. As I was packing up to continue my hike, a car stopped and a young man got out to ask me about my hike and, more specifically, about my kilt. We were joined by an older woman (Mom, I think), who also had several questions. We had a fun conversation about the AT, took a selfie of the three of us, and I headed on my way. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their names. 
After another 1.7 miles, I came to Brown Mt Creek Shelter. With my wife's admonition ringing in my ears, I hurried to check out the privy. Maybe I ate a few more apples than I should've. I'm sure I'll show more restraint the next time I come upon a tree laden with apples. Maybe...
Around 5:30 PM, with 3.1 miles still to hike, I came upon a lovely campsite. I had just filled my water bottles at a spring and had talked to a northbound hiker who told me about a youth group that was heading to Punchbowl Shelter for the night. I decided that 22.2 miles was far enough for one day and that I didn't want to get into camp after 7:00 PM for the third night in a row. 
It was nice to have time to set up my tent, eat dinner, clean up, and hang the bear bag before sunset. My 10 mile Nearo will now be a 13.1 mile Nearo; but, the pleasant evening was definitely worth it.","Seely-Woolworth Shelter, VA

Town Day! I was up and out by 7:15 AM. The fact that it's not getting light now until almost 7:00 AM is slowing me down in the mornings; but, wanting to get into town, I got up before first light and started packing. I had a short 13.2 miles to Glasgow. Unfortunately, the first five miles were a climb to the summit of Bluff Mt. 
I stopped in at Punchbowl Shelter after 3.1 miles of climbing to fill my water bottles. The youth group the northbound hiker had told me about yesterday was still at the shelter. As I suspected, the youth group turned out to be another Washington & Lee University Freshman Orientation group. Every group has been very nice; but, I'm glad I stayed at my stealth site last night. It was a bit crowded at the shelter. 
Upon reaching the summit of Bluff Mountain, I was rewarded with spectacular views of mist enshrouded mountains to the east and west. I also observed a memorial stone that rested on ""the exact spot on which Little Ottie Cline Powell's body was found on April 5, 1891"". Apparently, Little Ottie, aged 4 years 11 months, wandered away from school the previous November and managed to cover 7 miles before succumbing to the elements. 
Taking advantage of good cell phone service at the top of the mountain, I called Stanimal's and made arrangements to be picked up at 1:00 PM at the road crossing 8.9 miles away (yes - it's owned by the same guy who has Stanimal's in Waynesboro). Since it was downhill almost the entire way, I figured 3 1/2 hours gave me plenty of time to make the hike. Unfortunately, the rocks chose this moment to make another appearance. An added twist was that these particular rocks, ranging from walnut to grapefruit size, were loose and tumbly. The descent quickly turned treacherous. I managed to skate the whole way down the mountain staying vertical; but, my pace was greatly attenuated. 
I made it to the pick up point with 14 minutes to spare. I was met by Bob, a fuzzy guy in a rumpled hat. Bob is the caretaker at the Glasgow Stanimal's. We jumped in his old car with peeling paint and started the five mile trip over the winding mountain road to Glasgow. 
When I was a graduate student at UVA 30 years ago, my first wife and I would often travel from Charlottesville to our hometown of Charleston, WV. Since this was before the completion of I-64, we had to travel over Rt 60 through the WV mountains. It was a winding mountain road with short passing lanes on many of the uphill sections where you could pass the putzy Ohio drivers who couldn't seem to navigate the curves faster than about 12 mph. The only problem was I was driving a 4 speed manual transmission Dodge Omni which was powered by four hamsters. As we approached the passing zones, I would gear down so I could pass as many putzy Ohio drivers as possible before the lane ran out. The sound of me gearing down would invariably cause my wife to grab the door handle with one hand and cover her eyes with the other while hollering for me to slow down. 
I think, after all these years, I finally understand the terror my wife must have experienced in those passing lanes. Only, Bob didn't have passing lanes. He had solid yellow lines when he passed the other cars.  Luckily, it was a short trip to Glasgow. 
Glasgow is a small town with one convenience store, one restaurant, a post office, a fire department, a Dollar General, and a life sized brachiosaurus statue. Go figure. 
I was the only one staying at Stanimal's, so I had the whole place to myself (Bob and his wife Donna live next door). I completed my usual chores of showering, laundry, washing my pot and spoon, and figuring out how much food I needed for my next segment. I then headed down the street for dinner at the restaurant and resupply at the Dollar General. 
On my way back to the hostel, I stopped to check out the free thru hiker shelter provided by the town. It was originally constructed as part of an Eagle Scout project and is now maintained by the Episcopal church in town. It's a really nice shelter with electricity, portajohns, and a hot shower. 
I was excited to see a hiker sitting in the shelter reading a book when I arrived. The trail has been very quiet and it's always fun to touch base with a kindred spirit. I said, ""Hey, I'm Beaker!"" He looked at me for several seconds and, as the silence stretched out, he finally said, ""I'm reading a book."" I turned and walked away without another word. Bummer. 
The remnants of Harvey are supposed to arrive tomorrow. They are predicting steady rain all day. I had contemplated taking a zero until I found out that a travel baseball team will be staying here tomorrow. Choosing between a hostel with 13 teenage boys, a shelter with a jerky bookworm, or hiking in the rain, I've decided to go with hiking in the rain - assuming I survive the ride back to the trail with Bob...","Stealth Site, VA

Today was a nasty day to be out on the trail. The remnants of Harvey have reached us and it was wet, blustery, and cold. However, as has happened more than once on a rainy day, it turned out to be a good day of hiking. 
Bob delivered me back to the trail head by a little bit after 7:00 AM. The ride was calm and not nearly as scary as yesterday. I immediately crossed the 1000 foot long James River Bridge. It is the longest footbridge on the whole AT. Then, as often is the case on the first day after town day, I started climbing. In fact, the rest of the day was spent climbing. 
The rain held off for the first three miles; but, then the wind picked up and the first fat drops of rain announced the arrival of the front. The rain settled in to a steady, windy downpour. I basically put my head down and cranked out the miles. 
I passed two more Washington & Lee Freshman Orientation groups during my hike. Both groups had reached the end of their hikes and were waiting to be picked up. They all looked cold, wet, and miserable and relieved to be finished with their hikes. 
As long as I kept moving, I didn't get cold. So, I just kept moving all day. I also have given in and started listening to books on Audible to pass the time. I don't have anyone to talk to and I've heard enough forest sounds and bird calls to last me for years. I am listening to a book by Orson Scott Card which has captured my imagination, so the miles seem to fly by. Don't worry, I only use one earbud so I can still hear what goes on around me and maintain situational awareness. 
I arrived at Thunder Hill Shelter around 1:30 PM. I took a break to eat lunch and get out of the rain for awhile. Since I had already put in 15 miles, I contemplated stopping for the day rather than heading back out into the rain. However, it was still early and I have never been good at lying around a shelter all afternoon. I get too restless. 
So, I headed back out. I had gotten really cold eating lunch and had to hustle down the trail for quite awhile before I finally warmed up enough for my teeth to quit chattering. Another five miles of hiking brought me to Cornelius Creek Shelter. I passed another AT icon along the way - the Guillotine. It is a rock formation where you pass under a large boulder suspended above your head, trapped by the sides of a narrow passage between two rock faces. 
Four people were already in the shelter when I arrived; but, they gladly made room for one more. After changing into dry clothes, eating dinner, and hanging our food bags, we are all settled in our sleeping bags for the night. It is still blustery and rainy and predicted to get down in the 40s tonight; but, I am safe, warm, and dry for the night.","Stanimal's Hostel, Glasgow, VA

Another rainy day on the trail. It rained all night. We awoke to rain, wind, and fog. I was up and on the trail by 7:20 AM. The trail surface continues to be nice and smooth, so I was able to make good time. 
I stopped for a break at Bryant Ridge Shelter. It is one of the nicest shelters I've seen. It is a fairly new double decker shelter with room for about 20 people and a big front porch. If I had looked ahead at the trail guide yesterday, I might have pushed on to spend the night here last night. 
I headed out after a short break and continued hiking through the rain most of the rest of the day. I stopped for lunch and a break from the rain at Cove Mt Shelter.  As with the Bryant Ridge Shelter, I was the only one there. The trail was pretty quiet today. I expected to see more weekend hikers since it is a long holiday weekend; but, I think the rain has scared most of them away. I did see a day hiker with a beautiful white German Shepherd named Zoey who loved to play fetch. 
I took a pretty good fall today. I was moving it out pretty good along a level stretch of smooth trail and managed to catch my toe on a rock sticking out of the trail. The momentum from the backpack on my back propelled me forward and before I had time to react I was sprawled out on the trail. I ended up with banged up knuckles on my left hand and scrapes on my left shin. Oh well, nothing to do but brush myself off, stem the flow of blood and keep hiking. 
I arrived at Bobblet Gap Shelter, in the rain of course, around 5:00 PM. There are a father and his teenage son staying here tonight. We had pleasant conversation during dinner and are now settled into the shelter for the night. 
The weather is predicted to improve tomorrow and I am heading into town to spend the night at my cousin's house, so tomorrow should be another good day on the trail.","Cornelius Creek Shelter, VA

Finally! A pretty day to hike. We awoke to dripping trees; but, clearing skies. I bid goodbye to the father and son and headed out around 7:15 AM. It wasn't until I left that I realized that I never found out their names. 
The sun broke out of the clouds only a couple of miles after leaving the shelter and by mid-morning I was hiking under clear blue skies. Due to the vastly improved weather and the close proximity to the Blue Ridge Parkway, I saw several day hikers out today and stopped to briefly chat with most of them. For the most part, the trail was smooth and gently rolling, crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway several times. I made good time and arrived at the Wilson Creek Shelter for a mid-morning break in short order. 
The bright and beautiful day was dimmed somewhat when I learned via Facebook that a dear friend of mine from my days with the Mountaineer Area Rescue Group had died suddenly and unexpectedly. I spent the rest of the morning hiking with an air of melancholy, thinking of all the times I had spent with Ann on training missions and actual searches. 
The rest of the day's hike was uneventful and I arrived in Daleville around 4:00 PM. My cousin Bill was planning to pick me up around 5:00 PM and take me to his apartment for the night. Since I had an hour until his arrival, I went to the Kroger and resupplied for the upcoming section to Pearisburg. I also tried to stop at the local outfitter store and replace my leaking water bags in my Sawyer filtration system. Unfortunately, the outfitter was closed. I'll have to make arrangements to replace them tomorrow, I guess. 
Bill and his son, Matthew, arrived in short order and took me back to their apartment where I showered and washed my clothes. In a short while, his girlfriend Melissa and her daughter Jennifer arrived, bringing with them a wonderful meal of baked spaghetti, corn on the cob, and garlic bread. 
After dinner, we all settled in to watch the WVU-VT game. Although WVU lost, it was a very pleasant evening spent with family and friends. Tomorrow, Bill is going to drop me back off in Daleville and I will slackpack 20 miles past Tinker Cliffs and McAfee's Knob to VA Rt 311, where he will pick me up and bring me back to his place for another night.","Bobblet's Gap Shelter, VA

Today was a beautful day to be on the trail - both in terms of weather and terrain. My cousin Bill dropped me back off at the trail in Daleville around 8:00 AM. I was planning a 19.8 mile slackpack that would take me past Tinker Cliffs and McAfee's Knob. 
Even though I spent most of  the morning climbing, trail conditions were very nice, so I quickly covered ground, especially since my pack was very light. I have started listening to James Clavell's Shogun on Audible, which also helped the miles to pass. 
Since it was a holiday with beautiful weather, there were a bunch of day hikers on the trail. Tinker Cliffs were pretty crowded; however, the views were spectacular. I stood looking over the verdant green Virginia hills and valleys for a long time. 
I couldn't hang out too long, though, because Bill's son Matthew was meeting me at McAfee's Knob and I didn't want to leave him waiting too long. Bill had dropped Matthew off at the parking lot on VA 311 around 12;30 PM and he was hiking north on the AT for 3.9 miles to meet me on McAfee's Knob.
 Matthew is 15 and about my size, so I figured he would cover the ground pretty quickly. He texted me after he reached the summit and I realized he had climbed the trail much faster than I had anticipated. I was still two miles away. I kicked it into high gear and covered the remaining trail pretty quickly. 
As I had anticipated, there was a big crowd at McAfee's Knob. People were everywhere! McAfee's Knob has one of the best views in Virginia. It also has a rock overhang that juts out into air. AT thru hikers like to have their pictures taken sitting on the edge of the overhang, dangling their feet over the precipice. It is the most photographed feature on the entire trail. 
After a short wait, Matthew was able to take my dangling-feet picture. We then began our 3.9 mile descent back to the parking lot on VA Rt 311. Matthew went first and I had to really hustle to keep up! Ah, youth is wasted on the young. If I could have just a portion of that energy, I would have finished the trail weeks ago. 
About a mile from the parking lot, this guy jumps out from behind a tree and says, ""Boo!"" It's Shenaniguy! I haven't seen him since New York! I knew he lived in the area; but, when I had texted with him earlier in the week, he was climbing near Chattanooga. He had been keeping up with my blog and had decided to visit me on the trail when he got home. 
As he walked back down the trail with us, he filled me in on what Pluck and Silly Spilly were up to and we talked about all the other hikers we knew and speculated on where they were now. In short order, we reached the parking lot where Bill was waiting for us with bottles of cold Gatorade. I reluctantly bid farewell to Shenaniguy and we headed back to Bill's place. 
After Matthew and I got cleaned up, we headed over to a cookout at the house of Bill's girlfriend's sister. Thru hikers love cookouts! Hot dogs, hamburgers, mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes, fruit salad, chips, and desserts. Yum! 
Tomorrow, after dropping Matthew off for his first day of school and before he goes to work, Bill will return me to the parking lot at Rt 311, where I will continue heading south. This has been a very nice two day visit with one of my favorite cousins; but, I have to keep heading south. Unfortunately, they are calling for rain. Bummer.","Cousin Bill's Place, Salem, VA

Bill got me back to the trail by 8:15 AM, after dropping Matthew off at school and stopping at Advance Auto to buy more fuel for my stove. It was a beautiful day, with blue skies and light winds. Naturally, since I was leaving town with a heavy pack - let's all say it together - I climbed!
 I actually spent most of the day running along ridge lines. Unfortunately, rather than smooth, undulating trails, I spent most of the day scrambling over rock outcropping along the ridges. 
I passed two AT landmarks on the hike today. The first one came at 8.6 miles after a steep and rocky climb to the Dragon's Tooth. The Dragon's Tooth is a a 50 ft stone monolith at the top of Cove Mt. The views from the mountain were pretty impressive. I decided to eat lunch here and had pleasant conversation with two dayhikers. 
As I headed out, the skies clouded over and distant rumbles of thunder could be heard. Luckily, the rain held off for the time being as I continued to meander along the rocky ridgeline. Eventually, I descended to the valley, hiked through farm fields for awhile, and started to climb up the next ridges. 
After climbing 1500 feet, I reached the second landmark of the day - the Audie Murphy Memorial. Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier in World War II. He was killed in a plane crash in 1971, with the memorial marking the spot where his small plane plowed into the mountain. By now, it was 5:45 PM and I still had 5.2 miles to hike to the Niday Shelter, so I shifted into high gear and moved it out. 
It was getting pretty dark as I was nearing the end of my 22.7 mile hike. Naturally, with about a mile to hike, the rains arrived. Luckily, it was just a steady rain and not a downpour. I am the only one at the shelter tonight. The keyword for this portion of the hike is Solitude. Luckily, I have Shogun on Audible to keep me company. 
I am now settled in for the night. The rain is still coming down softly on the shelter. Dinner is done and my teeth are brushed. I am lying in my bed finishing off my blog. No signal here tonight, so I will have to wait until tomorrow to post. Don't worry - I start my day with a 2000 foot climb. I'm sure I'll have signal somewhere on the climb.","VA Rt 311

It rained on and off all night. I got up and under way by 7:20 AM. As I began climbing up the mountain right after leaving the shelter, the rain settled in. It was a cold and steady rain that went on most of the morning. Bummer. 
After climbing a couple miles, the trail leveled off and ran along the ridge. Unfortunately, as has been the case the last few days, the trail along the ridge was rocky. Only, along this ridge, the rocks were big tilting slabs. Wet, slippery slabs.
I ended up on my butt sliding down those tilted slabs a couple of times. I have fallen so many times on this trail that I don't even pay any attention any more. I just pick myself back up, try to wipe off as much dirt or mud as possible, staunch any blood flow, and keep on hiking. My legs are pretty scarred up from six months of scrapes and cuts. 
After descending from the ridge, I hiked through pastures and farmland for several miles. At one point, I passed the Keffer Oak, a huge oak tree that is the second largest tree on the trail. What a beautiful, majestic tree!
I stopped for lunch at Laurel Creek Shelter and the rain finally slacked off. Of course, the trees continued to drip for several hours and I brushed up against soaking wet bushes and underbrush as I walked, so it may as well have kept raining. 
The trail continues to be empty. The only people I saw on the trail were two hikers heading north. I continue to listen to Shogun on Audible as I walk. Luckily, it's a LONG book!
After climbing and descending a couple more mountains, I arrived at Warspur Shelter around 5:30 PM. By the time I arrived, the clouds had actually cleared and the sun was shining brightly. It was nice to get into camp early enough to fix dinner and clean up before dark. I am in the shelter again tonight and I am, once again, the only occupant. It feels like the beach I after Labor Day. This is a very pretty shelter with lots of grassy space for tents. I can imagine what it looked like earlier this summer with tents and thru hikers everywhere. Now, it's kind of sad and quiet. The mournful howls of coyotes in the distance just add to the sense of sadness and loss. 
Amazingly enough, I have walked almost 2100 miles now. I can remember way back to Georgia in February. The trail seemed impossibly long and daunting. It seemed like the exhausting 8 to 10 mile nibbles I was doing every day would never get me to the end. Now, I get up and walk 20 miles every day without a thought. The 123.3 miles left seems like nothing. Heck, I've walked 194.6 miles since last Monday. I'm not trying to say what I'm doing is amazing. It's just funny how what once seemed impossible has become so mundane. Sadly, I also know that I am going to quickly lose this level of fitness when I am not walking 20 miles every day. Hopefully, I can keep off the 40 lbs I have lost when I go home. It sounds like I'm going to have a lot of cycling in my future.","Niday Shelter, VA

It was a pretty chilly night last night. I was wearing all of my layers and was just a little cool. I was up and out by 7:30 AM. I had a long day planned, a 25.3 mile hike to Rice Field Shelter, setting me up for a Nearo into Pearisburg on Friday. Although there were two pretty good climbs, the majority of the hike was along ridge lines. So, I figured 25.3 miles was pretty doable. 
The other thing in my favor was that the rain had passed by yesterday evening. In fact, I woke up at one point during the night and the moon was so bright that it lit up the shelter. The morning was cool and sunny, with a light breeze - perfect hiking weather. 
The hike was pretty uneventful. I basically just walked while listening to Shogun on Audible. I didn't see anyone on the trail all morning. I stopped for lunch next to Big Stoney Creek and continued walking. At Pine Swamp Branch Shelter I finally came upon some other hikers. I met three women who were doing a southbound section hike. They had stopped to take a break at the shelter. 
After visiting awhile, I started the long climb up to the Peter's Mountain ridgeline. The AT straddles the VA/WV line along the ridge for about 10 miles. The trail was pretty good along the ridgeline, although it was pretty rocky in places. I passed through a couple of old farm fields along the ridge, complete with old apple trees. As you might have guessed, I ate my fill of the small tart apples. This appears to be a good year for apples. All the trees were heavily laden with apples. 
I finally arrived at Rice Field Shelter around 7:00 PM. This is a nice, fairly new shelter on the edge of a field on top of the ridge. There are actually five other hikers here tonight. They had all finished dinner and were settling in for the evening when I arrived.  
I decided to set up my tent tonight. It is pretty breezy on top of the ridge and my tent is actually much warmer than the open shelter. I am now settled in my tent for the evening. The moon is shining directly into my tent, lighting up the interior. 
Tomorrow, I only have a 6.8 mile hike down off the ridge, across the New River, and into Pearisburg, VA. The plan is for my brother Kenny to pick me up and take me to his house in Lewisburg, WV, for the night. I now have less than 100 miles left to hike and expect to finish next Wednesday. However, I am keeping an eye on Hurricane Irma. If it looks like it might reach SW Virginia mid-week, I might beat feet and try to finish this thing before Irma gets here.","Warspur Shelter

Getting out from under my down quilt was tough this morning. It was 43 degrees and breezy when I woke up at 7:00 AM. I learned early in the hike (when we were still having winter weather) to open the valve on my air mattress and pillow and deflate them. Once I was lying on the cold, hard ground it wasn't so comfortable under the down quilt. In fact, you could always tell when the day was starting in the shelter because you would hear one mattress after another deflating. 
Anyway, I used the deflating mattress trick on myself this morning to get moving. Since I was only planning to hike 7.8 miles into Pearisburg, I didn't worry about getting up and out too early. The hike was smooth and gentle all the way down into Pearisburg. 
The trail came out of the woods onto Rt 460 right next to the Celanese viscose plant. The incongruity of hiking through the woods and suddenly coming upon a chemical plant makes most people on the AT uncomfortable. I had a completely different reaction. The familiar brick buildings, reactors, storage tanks, and distillation columns made me homesick. 
My earliest childhood memories are of growing up near the FMC and Union Carbide plants in South Charleston, WV. Later, as a professional chemist at Union Carbide's Technical Center in South Charleston, I found myself visiting the Union Carbide plant often. It made me miss being a chemist and an infrared spectroscopist. 
I crossed the New River on Rt 460, continued through the woods another mile, and hiked an additional 0.7 miles down Cross Avenue into Pearisburg, where I came upon the Lucky Star Chinese buffet (can you say, ""All You Can Eat""?). I laughed when I finished eating and opened my fortune cookie and read: ""You will obtain your goal if you maintain your course."" Even the Chinese buffet is rooting for me to finish this journey. 
My brother Kenny, who lives in nearby Lewisburg, WV, picked me up at the Lucky Star. He was on his way to Radford, VA, to pick up my niece, Sarah, from college for the weekend. After picking her up, we returned to Lewisburg for the night. 
After going to Walmart to replace my leaking Sawyer water filter bag and resupplying for the next couple of days, we returned to the house and had homemade beef stew and yeast rolls, prepared by my sister-in-law Janet, for dinner. I also repaired the ripped mesh side pocket on my pack. I am now good to go for a few more days. Now, as long as Irma doesn't come this way, I may be able to finish this hike off once and for all.","Rice Field Shelter, VA

Today ranks high on my list of Great Trail Days. It definitely ranks as the best day of this section of the hike. My brother dropped me back at the AT at Pearisburg around 7:45 AM and I started climbing. And climbing. It was almost a 2000 ft climb to the ridgeline. I started off in the fog and climbed out of it as I ascended. 
Once I gained the heights, the rest of the day was spent undulating along the ridge. Although I had to cross a few rocky sections, for the most part the treadway was smooth and easy, allowing me to set a mile-eating pace. In addition, the weather was just about perfect - sunny and cool. 
 At one point I heard two creatures crashing through the underbrush to my right. I have seen a bunch of deer through this section; but, these sounded bigger. Then I saw it - a bear! A fairly good sized bear ran across the trail about 30 feet ahead of me. It then stopped and stood on its back legs and looked at me.
 Unfortunately, before I could get my phone out to take a picture, it dropped back down on all fours and loped off into the woods. Meanwhile, I heard what I assume to be another bear crashing away through the underbrush to my right. Not wanting to potentially end up between a mother and her cub, I kept moving; however, it was without a doubt the best bear sighting I've ever had. Throughout the day I also saw several more deer and a flock of wild turkeys.  
Wanting to get as many miles under my belt as possible before the rain arrives in a couple of days, I decided to knock out 25.8 miles to Trent's Grocery. Trent's Grocery has a deli, a full range of resupply options, and also has a camping area next to the store - everything a thru hiker needs. I was looking forward to getting to Trent's for a cheeseburger, onion rings, and ice cream. 
And then, as if it wasn't already a great day, the coup de grace. I got a text from Courtney (aka Brie, aka Hoops). She was driving up from NC to meet up with me! The thing I have missed the most on this last section of the hike is the camaraderie of other thru hikers. In fact, I have been downright lonely. As I've mentioned before, I met Courtney climbing Blood Mt on the second day of my hike, crossed paths with her continually throughout the hike, and summited Katahdin the same day. So, she is one of my best thru hiker friends and the fact that she was willing to drive 4 hours to meet up with me on the trail really touched me. 
I reached Trent's around 6:00 PM and had my burger and onion rings. I then went to the camping area to set up my tent. It is a neat field behind the grocery with several derelict campers parked in rows. In the middle of the camper graveyard was a bathhouse and room for several tents. I set up my tent and was heading back to the store for my ice cream when Courtney arrived. She was out of the car and giving me a big hug in seconds flat. 
I had been excited when she texted she was coming to visit; but, it was nothing like the rush of emotions when she actually arrived. It was so good to see one of my thru hiker friends. Someone who had been through rain, snow, good times, bad times, fun times, and boring times on the trail with me. Someone who had been over sections of trail in the Whites that seemed almost impassable and someone who had played the ""name the state capitals"" game with me to pass the miles. 
She also brought food! I had a 12 inch Subway sub and Sprite to tide me over until I could walk back to the store for my pint of ice cream. Once her tent was set up, we went back for the ice cream and a bundle of firewood. We were joined in the camp by an uncle and nephew who are LASHing (Long Ass Section Hiking) the southern portion of the trail. The four of us had a pleasant evening around a campfire under the stars listening to coyotes howling in the distance and telling hiker tales. 
Tomorrow, Courtney is going to slackpack me so I can knock down another 25 mile section of trail. She will then camp with me tomorrow night before heading back to college Monday morning. Her visit was perfectly timed. I am so close to being done and, at the same time, so impatient to be done. Her visit has reminded me why I have so loved being out here.","My brother's house in Lewisburg, WV

We awoke to fog and a heavy dew at the camper graveyard behind Trent's Grocery. Courtney was slackpacking me today, so I planned to knock down another 25.2 miles. She had even brought me a daypack I could use so I didn't have to carry my backpack. 
Courtney drove me back to the trailhead and I was on my way by 7:45 AM. Today's hike was a little hillier than yesterday's; but, it was  still fairly flat and the treadway was great. I climbed up out of the fog into full sun and blue skies - another beautiful hiking day. With the lighter pack, I was able to cover ground pretty quickly. I saw a couple of northbound hikers; but, once again, the trail was very quiet. Even the streams were quiet. What were once burbling streams are now just dry, quiet stream beds. 
After hiking about 10 miles, I stopped for lunch, enjoying a 12 inch Subway sub that Courtney had brought me. Around the 18 mile mark, I crossed US Rt 52 and came upon Courtney sitting at a picnic table next to the road. I refilled my water bottles and ate snacks before heading out to finish off the last seven miles of today's hike. 
Courtney told me that a Flip Flopper named Dancing Bear had passed about an hour ahead of me. I had first met Dancing Bear in Maine right after Mahoosuc Notch and had seen him off and on through Maine, last seeing him at Abol Bridge when he joined me and the rest of the Fellowship camping under the power lines. I was excited to finally run across another thru hiker that I knew. Of course, it happens with only two days left on trail. 
Courtney invited Dancing Bear to camp with us tonight and to run into Bastion, VA with us for pizza this evening. I headed out to finish off the last seven miles of the hike with visions of pizza slices dancing in my head. I arrived at Rt 715, where we planned to camp around 5:30 PM. Courtney arrived soon thereafter. We rounded up Dancing Bear and headed to Pizza Plus in Bastion. 
After a yummy pizza dinner at the Pizza Plus, we drove over to the Dairy Queen on Bland for dessert. What a great evening! I had expected to be eating Knorr Rice Sides by myself at some trail shelter. Now, here I was eating ice cream with Courtney and Dancing Bear at Dairy Queen. 
We returned to our stealth site next to Rt 615. We built a fire and the three of us sat around it reminiscing about all the hikers, hostels, and shelters we'd come across on our hikes. It was a very pleasant evening. 
Tomorrow, I plan to hike another 25 miles to Knot Maul Shelter, setting me up for a 14 mile hike in the rain on Tuesday to finish this thing off. Dancing Bear is also making for Knot Maul Shelter. I will be nice to have another thru hiker sharing the shelter with me on my last night on the trail. 
I am very indebted to Courtney for coming out and taking care of me for these past two days. It has been great to see her again and really nice to have the slackpacking and the food run to town. She really made this last little piece fun.","Trent's Grocery, VA

I was up as soon as it started getting light. The forecast was for rain in the afternoon, so I wanted to get in as many miles as possible before it arrived. I had a 24.4 mile hike planned to Knot Maul Shelter, leaving me less than 15 miles of hiking on Tuesday to reach the Barn. 
I bid farewell to Courtney and thanked her once again for coming out to visit me on trail. Camping last night with her and Dancing Bear felt like the old days on the trail. Dancing Bear was planning on hiking to Knot Maul Shelter today too, so I assured him that he would pass me shortly and headed out. 
It was overcast and windy all morning; but, the rain held off. As expected, Dancing Bear passed me fairly quickly into the hike. It felt just like the old days, with the young guys blowing past me as I trudged up the hill. He was the only other person I saw on the trail today. I settled into a steady pace, listening to Shogun as the miles slipped away. 
About 15 miles into the hike I stopped for lunch at Chestnut Knob Shelter. I arrived just as Dancing Bear was heading out. He told me that he was sorely tempted to stop for the day at this shelter because it was so nice. It was located in a meadow on top of a mountain. It was a fully enclosed shelter with windows, bunks for six, and a picnic table in the shelter. I agreed that it was definitely a beautiful shelter; however, I did not want to have a 25 mile hike tomorrow. I finished my lunch and reluctantly headed back out into the wind and light rain. 
Another ten miles of hiking brought me to the Knot Maul Shelter. It was the standard three sided shelter and not nearly as nice as the last shelter; but, it was dry and out of the wind. Dancing Bear was already at the end shelter reading a book when I arrived. I had stopped for water at the bottom of the hill, about a mile before the shelter. Most of the creeks are dried up, so I figured I had better get water here where there were a few puddles in the mostly dry streambed. 
We had a pleasant dinner at the shelter, both of us grateful for the company of another thru hiker. It's a shame that I just caught up with him two days before getting off the trail. We would've enjoyed one another's company. 
It still hasn't quite sunk in that tomorrow is my very last day on trail. I have been doing this since February. Although I'm more than ready to be finished, I know that I will miss the simplicity of this lifestyle where all you have to worry about is putting one foot in front of another. I will also miss the easy camaraderie of the thru hiker community. No matter whether you are on trail or in a trail town, you can immediately pick out a thru hiker and almost always be assured of a warm reception. That's the part of the trail I'll  really miss.","Stealth Site, VA

My final day on the trail was quite epic. The wind gusted all night and the rain arrived around 3:00 AM as the tail end of Hurricane Irma descended upon us. Since I only had 14.6 miles to hike, I slept in until 7:15 AM, allowing it to get light before I drug myself out from under my nice, warm down quilt. Finally, however, my bladder convinced me it was time to get up. 
After eating breakfast and packing up, it became apparent that the wind and rain weren't going to let up any time soon, so I decided it was time to hike. Dancing Bear was still in his sleeping bag and was contemplating taking a zero day at the shelter to ride out the storm. So, I bade him farewell and good luck and headed out. 
The wind was gusting and the rain was pelting as I climbed the ridge. There were leaves and branches down everywhere and I had to climb over a couple of downed trees. Actually, though, conditions weren't as bad as what I had expected based on the weather forecast. I just put my head down, turned on Shogun on Audible and kept on trudging. 
The trail profile was a little steeper than what I had hiked the past couple of days, with three pretty big climbs. Each time I descended from a mountain, I would have to climb over a stile and traverse a pasture. The pastures were usually liberally littered with cow patties and sometimes with cows. 
The pastures were also much more exposed than the woods. At one point, I came around the hill as I was traversing an open pasture right into a strong headwind, with sheets of rain pelting me. The wind was so strong I had to tighten the drawstring on my hat to keep it from blowing off. 
I was trudging up a long, steep hill at one point when Dancing Bear came bounding by like it was nothing. It really warmed my heart to be passed just once more by a young Twenty Something like I was standing still.  It was just like the old days. 
The rain made the trail very muddy and slick.  Just for old time's sake, I decided to slide on the mud and have one last fall on the trail. I missed falling in a very fresh and very oozy cow patty by mere millimeters! As usual, I picked myself up, wiped off as much mud as I could, and resumed walking. 
My timing was perfect with my Audible book. After listening to Shogun for close to 58 hours over the last several days, I finished the book just two miles shy of reaching the end of my hike. 
Eventually, I climbed over my last stile, walked under I-81 and approached the Barn Restaurant. As I walked up, Dancing Bear was on the porch, cheering me on. He said that he didn't want me to ""summit"" at the Barn alone, so he decided to hike through the rain to be there for me. 
After 2190.3 miles of hiking through rain, sleet, snow, wind, sun, rocks, roots, and mud, my hike was finally at an end. A casual observer probably would have said that the moisture on my cheeks was a result of the pelting rain. Any thru hiker would've known the true source and smiled, knowing that I had now well and truly earned the title of Brave & Fierce Thru Hiker.
