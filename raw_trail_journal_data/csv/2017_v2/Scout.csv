I’m sorry. It’s my fault the universe is askew. “You hike one long trail or three.” In the long distance hiking world the “Big Three” are the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. And here’s gospel: 
“No one just hikes two.” 
I have hiked two. The universe lies cock-eyed on its axis. 
""When are you doing the AT.” If I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard it, they'd make a line nearly as long as Maine's 100-mile Wilderness. 
I finished the Continental Divide Trail 18 months ago and almost every day I'd hear the same refrain. “What’s next, Scout?” or more bluntly, “When are you doing the AT?” 
A year ago or so, I began pointing people to my wife. “Talk to Frodo,” I’d say.” She was telling folks, “Scout is hiking the AT in 2017.” The thing is, I don’t think she talked to me first. That’s how it can be in long term relationships—she knew what I really wanted to do before I did. 
“Scout’s hiking the AT in 2017.” And now it’s two weeks away. Oh my gosh!
It’s time to put my Big Boy Pants. 
It's time to put the universe back on the right course.
Meanwhile, ... here in San Diego, it’s a slow night. We only have 12 starting PCT hikers in the house. … More on that topic later.",,Home,"May 12, Fri",0
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564578,"“What are you doing, Scout?”
What am I doing? I am setting out in 13 days. I‘m southbounding the Appalachian Trail. But when I mention starting in Maine in late May, it’s as if I set out a honey pot for AT horror stories. “Scout, please rethink hiking Maine in June. It’s black fly hell.” 
Another: “We pull out nearly 80% of the southbounders after 50 miles hiking.” 
“The stream crossings are dangerous, it’s so cold at night and the black flies are maddening.“ There again, it’s those black flies. 
It’s like poking a monster under the bed. One more: “I was covered in bites and blood from the black flies. We spent the early summer scrubbing blood and scabs off my neck and face!” 
Sigh. And then they start with how hard the hiking is. “The hardest on the AT is right at the start.” 
So, why does going southbound excite me? I like the number 200 more than 2500. There are 2500 northbound and only 200 southbounders. My way is a small village. The other is a small town. 
And I do like a challenge. I know, I know, beware of hubris. I’m sure discouraging words will be heard when I tackle Katahdin. And when black flies swarm. And …. 
I can tackle most anything if my Frodo is there. 
But Frodo will not be right there.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565379,"Where’s Frodo? Back in the day there was a popular bumper sticker, “Frodo Lives.” 
Sandy ""Frodo"" Mann is my wife.
On the PCT in 2007, I followed her for 2,650 miles. Four days before we crossed the Canadian border I have photos of her postholing in thigh-deep snow. She's strong and indomitable. She still takes my breath away. On the PCT she became ""Frodo."" How? That's a story for another day. 
On the CDT, she says, ""I only hiked 600 miles with Scout."" Boy, don't we use the word ""only"" in strange ways. The rest of those five months she did support for me and many other CDT hikers. Frodo put 14,000 miles on a mini-motorhome helping me and the rest. 
For the AT, here’s what she’s doing. Waving goodbye. 

 
On June 19, it will be our 40th wedding anniversary. How is that possible? Frodo: ""And where will he be?"" I will have run away from home.
In forty years we the most we have been apart is for two weeks. Twice. Each time was hard. This summer two weeks and longer will be the norm. They tell me, ""Watch out for black flies, the hard climbs and stream crossings."" But the larger question for me is how we will cope without each other.Stay tuned.",,View Entry,"May 20, Sat",0
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565458,"Where are they? Did they survive.? 
All I know is this: We share the same blood. I don’t mean just the same blood type, B+. I literally mean the same blood. 
“Good morning, Mr. Mann, Can I see your identification.” I handed over my driver’s license. The receptionist’s voice was flat. Her look was that of being early into a dreary eight-hour shift. I was one more random face. But then she sat up straight up. Her eyes glowed as if a sunrise had burst onto her computer screen. “Congratulations.” She smiled wide. “You’ve given six gallons.”
Of blood. One pint at a time. Forty-eight visits to pump out six gallons. Forty-eight times I reclined back in a sterile couch. “Which arm do you prefer?” Forty-eight times there was a sharp needle prick and I hoped this time I won’t bruise badly. 
I am a blood donor.
What place does this have in a trail journal? Well, recent studies validate the “cell memory” theory. Transplant patients wake up and find they have traits of their deceased donor. A middle-aged woman dancer wakes up with a new heart from an 18-year-old boy who died in motorcycle crash. She craves beer and chicken nuggets. Foods she never liked before. In a ten-patient study, researchers found each patient had two to five new parallels with their donor, changes in food, music, art and recreational preferences.
So, here’s what I wonder about those recipients of my blood. Do they suddenly have a strong desire to walk?
I think they should label donor blood.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565784,"On the Pacific Crest Trail, we observed our 30th wedding anniversary at the PCT high point, Forester Pass. We didn’t plan it that way. It was pure happenstance. And by the same happy coincidence our son was hiking with us. I turned to  Sean about a half hour before reaching that sharp edged saddle. “Would you do a re-marriage ceremony for us?” He was 25 and after shaking off the deer the headlights look, he did. To our original promises I added one. I promised to “Amuse her.”  
On the Continental Divide Trail, we had come off trail for a weekend and flown to Ketchikan, Alaska. The day after our anniversary, the two of us officiated at a wedding of our “trail daughter” Blazer. “With the full power of the State of Alaska, we pronounce you husband and wife.”

This time on the Appalachian Trail, I will have run away from home. The only one I will be sleeping near with be Rolling Thunder. He's 54 years old, will likely be bearded and he's a a New Zealand journalist. Not my type. Frodo will be 2,600 miles away.

So sad. 

But we are not crying over milk that's soon to be spilt. Instead, let’s throw a party. That’s what we did last Saturday night. We had over 50, someone else cooked and someone else played records from the 60s and 70s. We moved all the furniture out from the family and dining room and danced up a storm. What’s the difference between a dance party 40 years ago and one now? Back then we had a beer bar, not a wine bar. And back then we would not have been hoping for one more bar—stocking a fine selection of Bengay, Icy Hot, apirin and ibuprofen.

Here we are 40 years ago in 1977:

We’re going to the post office, the supermarket, or out for a dinner-and-a-movie date. The bolt latches. No particular significant attaches to the sound of metal seating home again metal. But what if you are leaving for five months?
I like our home. It’s our third house in the same San Diego neighborhood. It’s all the house Frodo and I ever wanted.  I thank her again for pressing for us to make an offer on the house at least six months before I was ready. We were meant to live here. There's the Swiss-Family-Robinson spreading tree in this back yard was meant to have the tree house I built with one of our daughters. A few dozen hikers slept in its queen-size-bed loft these past nine weeks. There was the once-ugly back room that was meant for the floor-to-ceiling--book wall I built with our elder two kids. This was meant to be the house in which we would host starting PCT hikers for 12 years. This hiker season we had 898 hikers stay one to three nights--in three big catering tents in the back yard, in the extra bedrooms inside, in the tent trailer and on the night we had 49, bodies were also strewn in the living room and in the carpeted garage. I love this house.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566113,"Step into my shoes. Put on those size-12 Brooks Cascadia trail runners and come scurry with me over the last 48 hours. 

Wednesday, I was up at the crack of dawn, putting the finishing touches on my first 16 days of trail food. Those “touches” took two hours. How is everything going to fit into the Prius? Rolling Thunder and I each have a fat boy duffle crammed with our packs, gear, days of food, and town clothes. Frodo has her camping gear for the ten days she’s with us doing support and for her sightseeing in Acadia National Park. There’s seven cases of books too. Books? Yes, I have a book talk this afternoon, a two-hour drive away, and they say over 300 have reserved spots. It’s like a 3000-piece jigsaw puzzle; it’s like a clown car bursting with luggage. Somehow, we manage to drive off by 1:00 pm. 

Over 350 attended my book talk. I prowled a stage as big as the ones you see in Ted Talks. The audience was amazing. Either I was spot on, they were high, or my mother had called each one and said, “Make my son look good.” 

Then we drove two more hours and dropped my car off at Mom and Dad’s. They live near the Los Angeles airport. Dad will be 93 soon and Mom is 87. Sorry, my eyes suddenly got misty. How do you say good bye to your parents for five months? “I love you,” I said looking each one in the eye. “You are the best of parents.” They both are still sharp, still in their own home after 55 years and dad still drives. Dad still calls out, “Happy Sunday,” or whatever day it is. He means it. Why is it so hard? It’s because I  am aware each time--Make sure I left nothing unsaid. 

Then we rush off to to catch a red-eye to Boston. I can’t sleep on planes. 

Thursday:  I know my iPhone says, “Thursday,” but driving to Portland, Maine in the rent-a-car, it feels like a straight shot, with no interruptions since Wednesday dawn. We get in a blessed, blessed three-hour nap looking quite dead on the futon at our Maine trail angel’s apartment. Seth Levy you’re great! Then errands. Unpacking. Trail journals. Last minute letters. We weave through salt-box homes on winding Portland streets to dinner at an old lighthouse establishment. I raise my first-ever Lobster Roll up to my lips. Ambrosia, who would know thy home lies in Maine.
And for dessert, there's a Maine specialty, Whoopie Pie.
Friday, it’s 6:30 am and I’m finishing up another trail journal entry. We’re meeting the Father of the International Appalachian Trail at 9:00 this morning. Then at noon I’m meeting a local PCT trail hero, 94-year-old Marcus Moschetto. At 4:00 pm I have a book talk here at the Oxbow Brewery to share his story for the first time in his home town. And, there's this little hike I start in the morning.

It’s raining outside right now, I hear my hiking companion Rolling Thunder snoring in the next room and I hear the regular breathing of the love of my life as she sleeps a few feet away.

I am a lucky, lucky guy.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566692,"I walked the final steps to the US/Canadian border monument and I felt it. Welling up deep inside was that emotion I have felt only two other times. I am starting a thru-hike. After all the preparation, all the aiming to this moment, I am actually here. I reach for Sandy. I bury my head into her shoulder. She feels me shake. Tears. Thru-hiker tears.
In the fairy tale of Rapunzel she sheds tears that magically cure her prince’s blindness. So, consider starting thru-hiker tears, what might they cure?

The IAT begins at the Fort Fairfield Border Station and its eponymous town felt like it had been ripped off a century old Currier and Ives calendar. There was a red brick library, quaint businesses with homemade signs in the windows and American flags like soldiers stationed on telephone poles marking the start of the Memorial Day Weekend.  

Just before starting we meet two International Appalachian Trail trail maintainers, Carol and Kirk. They had the latest maps and they had info not on any map, website or guidebook. We made copious notes. “Buggy and Boggy,” they said.

Of todays 19 miles, fourteen of them ran in a straight line hugging the border’s 40-foot-wide cleared swath.

Boggy: Three hours later, the thick mud under my feet gave way. There was a gurgle and slurp. I sunk well past my knee. Thank god it is sunny not raining. What does Rolling Thunder do? Stretch out a helping hand? No, he snaps a photo.

Insert stuck in mud photo: 

“Beaver pelt prices are near zero.” What’s that have to do with the price of tea in china? Why was IAT trail founder Dick Anderson telling us that yesterday? What the collapse of beaver pelt prices mean is that no one has been trapping beavers. Today we ran into multiple beaver ponds. Each time they flooded the border track. We gave up trying to keep our feet dry. We waded and bushwhacked. The dams were so long, were impressive and in a few places we could walk on the top. 
We saw our first Trillium.  

Our goal for the day was Mars Hill. It’s 1,750 feet, by far the tallest thing around, and we ended the day with a four-mile climb to the top where there was a lean-to shelter. But it’s Saturday night of a holiday weekend and locals had hiked up beer, Captain Morgan rum and had a party. I camped 200-feet away.

Very near me is a small cement monument I never knew existed. Right here, 40 feet from my tent is the spot where sunlight first hits the US. I will get up before sunrise tomorrow and bask in the first rays to hit anyone on US soil.  Cool.

NOT COOL! I did a cursory tick check tonight. “I need to get in the habit. “ And there, four inches above my knee was a black, poppy-seed-sized deer tick. Dang, dang, dang. 

I have been doing every thing right. I dug him out and saved him in a baggie. I circled the spot with my mini-Sharpie marker. Now I have to decide, “Do I take Doxycycline or not. There’s side effects."" The tick has been in for less than twelve hours.

Nineteen miles. It was a good first day. Dang that tick.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566810,"I am so excited. I am waking up in the spot where the sunlight first strikes the USA.

Fog. Socked in. Can't see 200 feet.
I guess it doesn’t sound impressive to say I woke in the spot where muddled-by-fog light first hit. 
Later this summer, August 21, we plan to travel from wherever we are on the AT to see the total solar eclipse. Rolling Thunder has done this multiple times during his lifetime. RT: “I’m an eclipse junkie.” He’s traveled to some of the most exotic places, to far away mountain summits. He’ll tell you all this, but his punch line, the one I dread and hope to break, is, “I’m also an eclipse jinx.” Rolling Thunder finds clouds, finds fog like this morning on Mars Hill. Noooo, this will probably be my only chance to see a total solar eclipse. I want to see the stars come out. I want to see birds go to sleep. We’ll likely have to drive five hours from the AT to see it. It’s time for RT to throw off his curse. Maybe if I secretly put a string of garlic around his neck.

I am so excited. (Do I get excited that easily?) We’re walking off Mars Hill, leaving the 24-tower wind farm, giant blades whirring, driving us crazy, and we’re plunging down a Double Black Diamond following the Mars Hill ski lift. But what awaits us two miles from the base is the village of Mars Hills and more important, Al’s Diner. Breakfast. I am already salivating for hash browns, the greasier the better, well-done bacon and maybe waffles?  Or French toast? Anything that will serve as a platform for slathered butter. 

But it’s even better than that. Taking our order the waitress at Al’s casually says: “Would you like your hash browns grilled or deep fried?” I wasn’t even aware that you could deep fry hash browns. Aaahhhhh.

Breakfast: 
Don’t get me wrong, yesterday was some hard hiking. Walking that straight-as-an-arrow border swath meant straight-lining it up hill and down valley, no switchbacks. And I’ll admit to being stiff and sore, parts not bending, like the Tin Man before Dorothy used the oil can.

All hail “Rails to Trails.”  Except for the two miles downhill off Mars Hill, the IAT follows an old railroad bed. We hiked twenty miles on a multi-use ATV, bike and hiking trail. Where the Bangor&Aroostock trains once belched smoke, we now recreate. This means the gentlest of curves, a raised bed so incredibly well drained I almost forgot yesterday’s bogs, and the grade is level as a pool-table.

Rail spike on Maine rails to trails: 
We finished our 23 miles by 5:30 and I’m writing this in what the IAT guidebook says is a .1 mile detour to the “famous Blue Moose restaurant.""
That's it. I’ve just raised the white flag. I am defeated. I might just keel over if I tried to finish this huge plate of tender pot roast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy and coleslaw. Rolling Thunder sits across from me routed, fleeing in ignominious defeat. His plate of lasagna victorious. Two thru-hikers slain by food. We hang our heads in shame.
We set up our tents on the broad, fresh-cut grass lawn behind the Blue Moose. Vanquished by food, the balls of my feet scream at me like shrill whistles from one of the Bangor&Aroostock steam engines. I am ready to turn out the headlamp. 

Good night Guy on a Buffalo. Good night Princesses. Goodnight Trail Tribe. Good night to the old lady whispering, “Hush.” Good night all.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566935,"As Gandalf and the dwarves invaded his snug and warm hobbit hole, Bilbo Baggins thought, “I don’t camp.  I don’t hike.”  Ah, but he would.
“I don’t camp.  I don’t hike.”  Not the words I expected from the father of a long trail.  Dick Anderson was driving interstate 95 in Maine in 1995 when the idea leapt into his head.  “Why me? Send this message to someone who likes to hike in the outdoors.” He fishes; he hunts; but he doesn’t hike. “The message came to the wrong person.”  If this were a comic strip there would be a light bulb above Dick’s head as he sat in his speeding car and next to it would be: “The Appalachian Mountains continue north from Katahdin to Newfoundland, why doesn’t the Appalachian trail?”  

Fathers don’t get to choose their children.

But this particular father was politically well connected in Maine. He was the state Commissioner of Conservation and a good friend of the governor.  A short while after the genesis of the IAT concept, the governor asked, “Dick, I need some great new idea to promote Earth Day!”

And Dick said, “How about announcing the creation of an International Appalachian Trail?”  Maybe the message had found the right person after all.

IMF.  I am going to write this in this journal often enough, I’ll need an abbreviation.

We camped on the large back lawn of the Blue Moose restaurant, grass as soft as piled goose down.  At 6:30 this morning I headed back on the old railroad bed ATV track.  I almost did a 10-by-10 (ten miles by 10:00 am), but I wasn’t trying.  I need to nurse my foot, and an ankle that’s saying words I can’t repeat to the princesses.  

We popped out in Houlton and had lunch in a Tim Hortons restaurant.  Hot chocolate and a panini.  Life is tough.  

Tim Hortons drink had a slogan I really liked: 

“I don’t camp.  I don’t hike.”  Rolling Thunder and I found out we have more in common than a love of long trails.  Neither of our parents camped or hiked or did much of anything in the outdoors.  But mine took me to Boy Scouts.  And Rolling Thunders’ took him to The Church of England Boys Society.  The Scouts and the Society took us each camping once a month.

Also in Houlton I entered somewhere I never expected to go while on trail – a Walmart.  Here’s me with my Walmart greeter.

 
IMF.  That’s shorthand for “I Miss Frodo.”  

(Note from Frodo: So here I am, transcribing Scout’s journal entry, thinking “What’s this IMF thing?  He shouldn’t just throw it out there and not explain it.  That’s dumb!”  And then it turns out he’s being sweet. Scout had told me that he should hike the first three days without support from me, so it would feel like the beginning of a real thru-hike.  So I took myself off to Prince Edward Island to be a tourist and then stopped and visited hiker friend Coyote (Dave Wood, PCT ’07) and his wife Sheila I Nova Scotia.)

As Rolling Thunder and I tread along our 11-mile country-lane road walk, I hear a car slow behind me.  Frodo.  We expected to see her this evening, since we are all staying in a motel that’s right on the trail.  And I was so overjoyed to see her that I completely forgot that this means I have the opportunity to slackpack.  I was honestly surprised when she offered, “Would you like me to take your pack?”

Tonight I used my one Walmart purchase – a large 4-inch magnifying glass.  

[Princess alert] Damn.  The magnifying glass shows the tiny tick head is still in my leg.  I tweezer it out.  A dose of doxycycline it is.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566993,"How many times did I give that advice to hopeful PCT thru-hikers this year?  “Always start out slow on a thru-hike.  Don’t get injured early.” So what did Rolling Thunder and I do?  Three days of 19, 21, and yesterday 23 miles.  

My left ankle and the balls of both feet finally drive some sense into me.  Today we will hike only 13 miles.  We will go light on ourselves.  We start late, 9:00 am instead of 6:30.  We finish at 2:00.  Bankers work longer hours.

We get our first long look at Mt. Katahdin.  “Scout, this is your DESTINY.” 
This is wet country.  Trees wet, thick, green, with hanging mosses. Roadside fresh-cut lawns soft as pillows. The most water I’ve carried so far is just over 2 liters, and that’s only because I don’t want to fuss with the many opportunities to refill.  It is so, so different than the PCT or CDT.

If it’s so wet, then why did the waitress last night say, “This is a dry county?”  Oh, right, that kind of “dry.”  Can’t buy beer, wine, or spirits.  Part of todays’ “trail” was a country lane and it was quite evident this is Amish country.  





Today’s truly strange roadside sight was not this “pet” rock, it was a herd of buffalo.  What are buffalo doing in Maine? (Frodo: actually bison, not buffalo.)  I kept looking for Guy On A Buffalo, my often CDT companion.  Only if you are really bored and don’t have food in your mouth should you watch the four 2-minute “Guy on a Buffalo” videos.  (Warning: they are not PC.)

Finally, a shout-out to the Princesses.  Yes, any of you readers of the female persuasion may consider yourself a princess, but I am talking about my three Princesses from the CDT.  A family who are good friends and who include three daughters read an entry from my CDT journal each night out loud.  The Princesses were then 10, 8, and 6 – C, S, and J.  So when I used words like “vulva,” I’d write “princess alert” just before.  In that case I had “mosquito bite,” “vulva,” and “Hike Naked Day” in the same sentence.  Here it would be black flies and we are simply not going there.

On the roughest nights as I journaled in my tent, it warmed me to know that they would gather soon and read out loud what I was writing.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566996,"All day we hiked on a backcountry ATV trail; such a change from yesterday’s roadwalk.  A big thanks to IAT Maine Vice-President Cheryl and her husband Kirk, who mapped out this new route and arranged for it to be part of the IAT.  Otherwise we would have spent another day pounding pavement in Maine.  

Our first moose sighting!  It was as we drove back to the spot where Frodo picked us up yesterday afternoon.  We’ve seen plenty of moose scat and even bear scat.  Today’s bear scat looked fresh.  

Today was a classic green tunnel.  We had fine mist this morning and gray overcast all day, but that’s way better than hiking in rain.  And the blackflies weren’t TOO bad.

I don’t check the weather ahead much at all, but Rolling Thunder has been checking often.  The 5-day and 10-day forecasts change more often than a newborn’s diapers.  One moment, 4 of the next 6 days say rain and the next moment it’s the opposite.  Drives me a bit batty.  All of this is leading up to… What is the best day (which really means just something decent, not storming) to climb Mt. Katahdin?  To quote Doris Day, “Que sera, sera…”

I think my backside is going to be famous.  RT has his camera out again, using me as the hiker prop in his photo.  Again.  And again.  “Just keep on walking,” he says.

At hike’s end at 3:00 pm, in the Shin Pond store, we ask about hiking season, i.e. when will we have to worry about the woods being filled with guns.  We hear it won’t be till fall.  “Except for coyotes.  You can shoot them anytime.  Except Sundays.  It’s illegal on Sundays.”  Coyotes must like Sundays here.

I am going to post a foot photo of old friends – my blisters on my second and third toes.  They come out to play during the first week of every long hike.  Sure, they sting, but I greet them like long-lost cousins.  They will callus over soon enough.  And – whispered – my left ankle feels better and the balls of my feet have toned down to a dull roar.  I’ll try to keep my foot photos to a minimum.","Turn-off from Town Line Rd

We passed a classic beaver pond and lodge.  It could have been a movie set.  the only thing missing was the slap of a beaver tail as I walked by.  

I have to give a shout-out to Mt. Chase Lodge in Shin Pond.  It is run by two AT thru-hikers, Lindsay and Mike.  A warm rustic lodge with Michelin-Star food prepared by Mike.  

This is us eating breakfast this morning.  On my CDT hike I was losing weight and Marcia Powers challenged me to equal her 8-meals-in-a-single-town-day record.  Don’t worry, I’m not going to try that 10,000-calorie marathon again.  But she wrote a guestbook entry already – “Eat more, Scout, eat more!”  I’m trying, as you can see.

We slept in a bear hunters’ tent bunkhouse at Matagamon Wilderness Campground last night.  We had hiked over 4 miles beyond it yesterday afternoon, then Frodo had driven us back.  She and I had one bunkhouse tent  and RT slept in  another one, 75 feet away.  At our 7:00 am breakfast the talk at the tables around us was of the advantages of various caliber rifles and of the bear that one of them missed yesterday, though he had a clean shot.  The magazine in the restroom was an issue of “Concealed Carry.”  These are nice people; witness the 5-year-old’s birthday party we sat next to last night at dinner.  We share talk of the outdoors, and they are eager to hear about our hike.  I’ve never knowingly had a gun on our house.  We have to be able to talk with each other, be respectful, and to keep the door open to compromise.

(Frodo: though there was the female hiker who contacted us and mentioned that she would be bringing a handgun with her.  We told her she would need to stay with some other San Diego host.  She then declared that she would not have her gun with her; her husband would bring it to her after her first week of hiking.  We found out later that she indeed did have a gun with her when she stayed with us.  That was pretty rude and made us pretty angry.) 

At the Grand Pitch lean-to we enjoyed reading the shelter’s journal entries, which ranged from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Now Rolling Thunder and I were forced to wear our bug headnets today, just to keep our sanity.  But two who were at Grand Pitch in May of 2016 claimed they counted “38,461 mosquitos and 481,238 blackflies.”  I think they were being conservative.  Here’s RT suffering from the bugs and the rain. 

And on August 27th last year, only ten entries before ours, fine handwriting celebrated “The U.S.’s newest national monument….. Now all will have an opportunity to experience the beauty and bounty of the Maine woods!”  Why am I quoting this?  The signature below it was Sally Jewell, U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

The journal showed only two other entries this year before ours, both on short jaunts.  

We did experience the beauty of the Maine woods, perhaps a bit too much.  We were locked in a green tunnel all day, the woods enveloping us, walls closing in above.  No hoped-for views of Katahdin.  At days’ end the terminus of the IAT will be 10 miles away and Katahdin will be 22 miles distant.  

Wassataquoik.  When Frodo said, “Make wise decisions” when she left me this morning, it was the Wassataquoik River she had in mind.  It’s the one dicey crossing on this 140 miles of IAT.  It’s either ford it if we can, 5 miles into tomorrow, or make an 8-mile detour to a dilapidated but probably passable old bridge.  We will see.


Near days’ end, hoping to make it to an old lookout on Deasey Mountain, the trail turns to Appalachian-Trail-like ups and downs, a rocky, mossy, limb-strewn path, faint because it is the little-trodden IAT, heading too often straight up or straight down.  Then heavy rain.  That’s no way to treat us at the end of the day.  But as we come out of the trees to the summit of Deasey there’s the ten-by-ten lookout building.  And there, finally, is our reward, a stunning 360° view, clouds lifting, Katahdin streaked with snow to the west, Mt. Chase and the rest we’ve hiked by the last few days to the east.  We can cook and sleep in the snug wood- and glass-paneled building.  It started raining again, but I’m eating mashed potatoes with home-dehydrated chicken and Harmony House freeze-dried veggies.  Hot chocolate can’t be far behind.  The wind is whipping noisily outside and I am writing to you.","Four Miles beyond Matagamon camp

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567615,"For the first four miles from Deasey Mountain, we needed our Continental Divide Trail navigation skills.  On the CDT there was often ill-defined or non-existent trail.  One guidebook says, “Plan on getting lost at least once a day.”  Here on the IAT we weaved and danced through dense forest, with the winter’s blowdowns an extra wildcard thrown in for us First-on-the-IAT Guys.  A half-dozen times today we stopped, looked at each other, looked at the woods, and backtracked, looking for the elusive but wonderful IAT markers.  

On the Appalachian Trail, they tell us, navigation will be a non-issue, a white blaze every hundred feet or so.  

Speaking of skills, take a look at the Wassataquoik River crossing.  This “ford” has been at the back and then the forefront of our minds since day 1.  “The rocky bottom is like greased bowling balls.”  For you PCT aficionados, it’s three times as wide as Evolution Creek and deeper.  I went across in my underwear, as in only my underwear.  My first deep steps in I lost my footing, my body and pack went half under.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T.  Thinking about each plant of the foot, each lock of the trekking pole time to the streambed, I slowly made my way across.

HIGH FIVE, ROLLING THUNDER!

Soon after the river crossing we were on old, grown-over roads, and grateful for them.  We had lunch in a lean-to 1.7 miles before finishing the IAT and the trail gods smiled on us – it started and stopped raining while we ate lunch.  How civilized.

Forty minutes later we reached the Southern Terminus of the IAT.  Another High Five.

Less than 7 miles later, after passing Katahdin Lake, we pulled into Roaring Brook Campground and heard the good news.  The weather prediction for tomorrow on Mt. Katahdin is good.  It’s a GO for us to take off bright and early for the summit.  We intend to climb up the east side from here, cross the Knife Edge to the summit with the famous Appalachian Trail Northern Terminus sign, and then descend down the west side, finally on the Appalachian Trail.

A mile before our hike ended today, I spotted a little rock and pine cone sculpture in the middle of the trail. When I got close I noticed that someone had left a handwritten note on a piece of birchbark.  “RT, it’s from Frodo!”  It’s fitting today to end with a photo of her note.","Deasey Mountain Lookout
",Roaring Brook Campground,"Jun 03, Sat",16.70
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567797,"“Make wise decisions.”  Frodo’s last words to me as she sent us off from Roaring Brook Campground to climb Katahdin.  I won’t see her for over three weeks. 

On the Continental Divide Trail, soon after we felt the heft of that beast, she stopped saying “I love you” last thing as she left me at a trailhed.  She always said that, but it was followed by “Make wise decisions.”  That admonition was definitely appropriate today.

It wasn’t just the vertical gain of 4,000 feet, it’s that we did it in under 3 miles, up the Helon-Taylor (“Heel-on”) Trail.  The upper portions had me in 3-point, 4-point, and even 5-point stances.  If 2 points are my feet, and the next 2 are my hands – and boy are they scratched up tonight from all that rough-surfaced Maine granite – then what’s the fifth point I’m putting on the ground to eke out every last bit of cling to the face of granite chimneys and refrigerator-size block vertical walls?  The fifth point (maybe a princess alert) is my keister, my bum, my rear end, my tush, me a_s.

I’m not sure photos will do it justice, but, here, I’ll try:

 
(Frodo: Woah, dudes!  That was one hairy hike!  Glad I missed that one!)The last 1.1 miles to the summit is the knife edge.  Even Rolling Thunder, who is an excellent climber and mountaineer, was taxed.  I’m not afraid of heights, but I could not let myself look down.  Pitch after pitch was challenging, with both sides near-sheer drop-offs, and I had to focus on my next handhold – will that granite flake hold my weight?  Can I wedge my foot into that narrow gap and push myself up?  Actually, numerous times I was in a 6-point stance, with my back pushing hard against a wall as I crept my feet and hands up higher.

Rolling Thunder had estimated four, but it took us five hours to reach the summit.  As I got close, as I knew I would soon see that iconic sign from so many photos, as I knew that after 9 days hiking I would see my first white blaze and finally be starting on the real Appalachian Trail (after talking about it for so long), I choked up.  I am really here, I thought, and I shook for a moment, eyes misty, and then I walked those last steps.

Here’s a shout-out to my yoga class, “Warrior Two.” (Frodo: I haven't got that photo yet, sorry)
Since before we started it had been really important to Rolling Thunder to summit Katahdin in sunshine – views, not stuck in a cloud.  Me, I just wanted to get there. And if it wasn’t too much to ask for, please no rain.

Rolling Thunder got all he wanted.  Though we began in sun, clouds quickly rolled in and for a long time we could see that Katahdin’s summit was cloaked, as if a paper bag had been pulled over its face.  But then the clouds lifted and gave up sweeping views of lushness greener than a Star Wars tropical planet. We could see where we’d come from to the east, and south of us we could see far into the 100-mile Wilderness, our destiny.

  
It was distinctly odd to see 15 others at the top. During our 8 days on the IAT we saw two other hikers.  Now we were about to enter a trail where such solitude was as rare as a buffalo (Frodo: I am transcribing Scout’s journal from photos he emailed to me. Following “buffalo”  there is a word that is totally illegible – hickie? hiker?)(Ha! I’ll include the photo of this page so you can see what I’m working from!)

Our next adventure awaits, but right now, tonight, I write from the Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinockett.  My feet sting, but they feel better than they have for days (don’t worry, no foot photos!)  Tomorrow I will take a zero day, a much-needed day of rest.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567916,"Why Car 54?  Well, I’m on a zero day and I’m feeling giddy, is as good an explanation as any.  But bear with me.
On each of my last two trails, the PCT and the CDT, I had a special piece of jewelry commissioned.   On the PCT it was Frodo’s trail ring for our 30th anniversary, and the source of her trailname.  I still wear the tiny PCT symbol proof-of-concept pendant on a chain around my neck.  When I hiked the CDT I had a pair of CDT symbol earrings made for her.  I wear that CDT proof-of-concept pendant on the same chain next to the PCT one.  But what was left to do for the AT?

Last November I got a letter from our trail friend “Bump.”  She described how she and her hiking partner Loren had been a really big help to a hiking couple on the trail in Northern California.  It was especially meaningful because the guy had been laid up sick.  Bump wrote that as she and Loren were saying good-bye to the couple, the woman reached around her neck and took off a brown cord necklace with a diamond-shaped pendant.  The woman said that only a limited number of the brass pendants had been cast.  They are to be given, not purchased, given to express gratitude for above-and-beyond help to a hiker on the trail.  Since then Bump had kept the pendant on her dresser.  She had heard I planned to hike the AT.  The diamond pendant has the AT symbol.  In the envelope Bump had enclosed the necklace.  “For all your above-and-beyond trail angelling.” I put it on my neck.


They say, “The trail provides.”  That necklace is still on.

But here’s the thing.  The tradition is, you are supposed to pass it on to someone who has helped you on the trail - I really don’t want to part with it.

But I didn’t want each of our three kids to go, to leave home, either.  But that’s what we do with who we love and with what we love most.  We set them free.

I clench it tight in my hand as I write.  It is Trail Karma Pendant number 383.  One of 500.

Trail Karma Pendant No. 383, where are you?  Tonight you are still with me. 

Going from the sublime to the silly, here’s what my beard might have looked like if I had grown it since 1974, like this guy who came into the Appalachian Trail Café.

 
“Princes of Maine.  Kings of New England.” A big tip of my torn hiking hat to anyone who guesses the book that quote is from.  It’s the book I’ve torn into sections to read on the trail.  What kind of monster rips up books?!?

Just when my parents should no longer have to worry about me getting a tattoo, here I am with my new “AT” tattoo.

And, Mom and Dad, not only do I have one myself, but I am a veritable Johnny Appleseed of tattoos, encouraging others.  Here are four of us at dinner tonight, with our  bright gold “AT” tats.

Book quote hint:  The movie made from that book starred Toby Maguire and every night Michael Caine said that to a room full of boys.  

And as for “Car 54,” it was a silly 1960s police sitcom set in the Bronx.  The two stars drove patrol car 54, and the title and tagline was, “Car 54, where are you?”  Who was the tall star?

Book hint, if you haven’t figured it out yet: The author also wrote The World According to Garp.  

Car 54 star hint: He was 6’5” tall and is best known for his role as Herman Munster in “The Munsters.”

Book answer:  Cider House Rules.  It is set deep in the backcountry of Maine, which is why I am re-reading it.

Car 54 answer: It starred Fred Wynn.

What a good zero day it has been – food for the next section packed, clothes and body cleaned, feet rested.

The first ten miles were as billed.  Look at Rolling Thunder walking a billiard-table-smooth green tunnel.
 
I’ve never been to Niagara Falls.  Have you?  In the first ten miles we passed both Little Niagara Falls and Big Niagara Falls – Maine’s namesakes of the more famous New York landmark.  Tell me if this photo of Little Niagara Falls doesn’t resemble one of those near-impossibly-beautiful outdoor scenes from a beer commercial.
 
What are these flowers?  They looked carnivorous, fitting for having just entered the 100-Mile Wilderness.  Flies and small fingers beware.

But he’s as happy as can be.  HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike.)

Most of our 7 miles into the 100-M-W today was dark, dense trees, roots snaking across the trail, rocks jutting out, dank leaves thickly strewn on the path, punctuated by mosses and lichens.  But we aimed for a feature called Rainbow Ledges.  There is no shelter there and no campsites mentioned, but we had a feeling.  With a name like that, what can go wrong?

“Rolling Thunder?”

We shouldn’t be seeing each other.  Something is wrong.  I should be at least three miles ahead of RT, and I shouldn’t be coming at him from the opposite direction…

It had been an idyllic morning.  There had been a near-full moon last night , for once visible, and the sun had risen to peek over Mount Katahdin’s shoulder. There was no condensation, no prospect of rain.  With us actually on the Appalachian Trail, Rolling Thunder and I were each going to indulge our own preferences.  That meant I would hike out early at 6:30 and planned to take a long lunch break.  RT wouldn’t start until nearly 8:00 am and would take a short lunch.

I’d been in a zone, legs feeling good; there had been a few sets of blowdowns, one a mass of small and large trees like a jumble of pick-up sticks.  I’d had to go a ways off trail to get around the mass of blowdowns and then picked up the AT white blazes again.  I had been preoccupied and hadn’t looked at my map.

“RT, are you going the wrong way?”  Surely I couldn’t be wrong.  Not on this perfect day when I should be three miles ahead of him.

“Scout, I left camp 20 minutes ago.”

It hit me like a ton of bricks.  I must have gotten turned around in the blowdown area and had been blissfully hiking back to our campsite where I’d begun.  I’d been walking the wrong way for over a mile.  Dang.  Dang!

When I realized what I’d done, we both busted out laughing.  Then I said, “It’s Frodo’s fault!”  RT replied, “Of course it is.  Blame the person who’s not here.”

It was solely my fault, but most of the time I had been thinking about her.  No, not thinking about her THAT way.  I was thinking of our anniversary in 112 days and mulling over the germ of an idea.

Man, what a doofus!  Here I am, the PCT and CDT thru-hiker!  But it was a needed wake-up call.  These woods are dense, no landmarks to be seen, and one set of roots and rocks looks like another.  I think it was in Maine a year ago an AT thru-hiker went off the trail to relieve herself, couldn’t find her way back to the trail, got more and more lost and, I am sorry to say, she died.

Here is the blowdown jumble that turned me around:

We made the next shelter, nine miles, for a streamside lunch. Though I admit thinking a a few sour thoughts the last two miles, that I should have already been there relaxing.
For brief periods the dense forest thicket gave way, so we saw lakes, and we hiked along one gorgeous gorge of tumbling water. None of my photos really sis it justice.
And day’s end was a kick-in-the-pants climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain with a double measure steep trail and irregular staircase steps coming down.
AT 6:00 pm I was very glad to get to Wadleigh Stream Shelter Lean-to after 17, ahem 20, hard miles.
Had a great time chatting over dinner with other hikers. Even laughed over my story today. And the germ of an idea I had about our anniversary for Frodo may be worth getting lost over.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568379,"Heaven is called Whitehouse Landing.  I am one-third of the way through the 100-Mile Wilderness.  Thirty minutes ago I came across three hikers standing next to their packs as they’d been for 10 minutes, wondering, “Where is the trail?”  We were in the middle of another blowdown section.  Rolling Thunder had dropped his pack there as well and was looking for the trail.  They pointed, “Your friend struck out that way.”  I “knew” the trail was 100 feet in the opposite direction.  I struck out in the opposite direction, and this time what I “knew” was right.  
The three of them had never heard of Whitehouse Landing.  They had planned to slog ahead for another day. Instead, we all boarded a restored 1942 15-foot varnished wood motorboat to head across Pemadumcook Lake to half-pound burgers, lakeside cottages with beds and showers, and canoes.

Whitehouse Landing.  In past years, hikers signaled them with an air horn.  Now there’s a 21st-century moment of cell coverage and you call them to sweep you out of dense wilderness into a greensward, Tolkienesque Lothlorien.  

An 80-year-old teak and canvas canoe hangs overhead in the lodge.  Next to the kitchen hangs this sign: “Papers: $40, Bowls: $50 Bowls and Papers come with 4 grams of complimentary ….”  Can you guess the next word?  It seems that for the past year in Maine it is legal to possess marijuana, but still illegal to sell it.  But guess what – it is not illegal to give it away.  Hence with your $50 box of zig-zag papers comes a gift of weed.  Merry Christmas in Maine.


Heaven can’t be absolutely perfect, but does it’s flaw have to be black flies?? Couldn’t they have stayed in purgatory or another of Dante’s Circles?  This photo says it all.

Thankfully my black fly bites do not look anything like that.  Here’s another hiker’s black fly defense strategy:

For dinner in heaven the give you a whole pizza.  And then they say, “I put those last two pieces in a baggy for you.  Put them in the fridge and tomorrow morning you can pack them out and have them for lunch in the trail.”

Here's the suspended canoe in the lodge:
and here we are in front of the lodge:

But by 8:30 we’ve taken the old runabout across the lake and re-entered our real world – hiking.  We’re in dense trees, thicker than my hair used to be, when Rolling Thunder stops and points.  Not more than 40 feet in front of us a horse-sized moose breaks on to the trail, takes one look at us, and if mooses could point with surprise this one would have done so.  But she did give us one long-nosed stink-eye stare and bolted noisily.  

Wow, a moose!  And that close!

Minutes later we ran headlong into Alpine, another AT northbounder.  He started January 1st.  Can you imagine?  He endured minus 14 degrees and hiked through two-foot drifts of snow.  And now he’s days from finishing.  “Alpine, we just saw a big cow moose!”

“What?!?  I’ve walked this whole trail and haven’t seen one moose.  I’ve seen so much (princess warning!) moose shit you could fill the Panama Canal with it! And you saw a moose! “(Said with just a slight bit of derision as if we hadn’t earned the right yet.)  RT and I both felt terrible.  That moose must have been waiting for Alpine, and we blundered along instead.  It was the wrong moose! (And yes, the Panama Canal bit was my little embellishment.)

Yesterday it heated up to 90 degrees.  The Whitehouse Landing porch thermometer said 84 degrees at 5:00 pm.  Today the sun stayed in bed.  The light gray cloud cover kept the temperature down in the 70s and in the afternoon our umbrellas darted out from their pack pocket holders (Frodo: of their own volition?)  There was on-and-off rain all afternoon until “Ker-bam!” A big thunderclap rolled through the forest and then it was just rain and rain.

Rolling Thunder and I are set up in our dry tents in a stealth camp (probably no one has set up a tent here before – we’re well off the trail near Crawford Pond).  We each cooked in our vestibule and turned in.  There was the oddest set of birdcalls putting us to sleep.  It sounded like the intelligent avians from Hitchcock’s “The Birds” were plotting how to attack us.  Or was it a dream?

Can anyone tell me why, here in the land of high humidity, we have had virtually no condensation?  In 15 days there has been only one morning with condensation, and that was just the teensiest bit on a sleeping bag.  At the same time, back on the Pacific Crest Trail, in the ultra dry Southern California desert, we could have serious condensation half the nights.  Shouldn’t it be the opposite?

 

Today was a day of Trail Maintainers.  First, in the photo below, what does Maine Appalachian Trail Club volunteer Dustin have in his hand?  (Hint: It’s for the privy.)


 

Answer: Privy microbes.  Twice a year Dustin and his wife Hannah seed their shelter’s privy with beneficial microbes.

 

Nearing the Logan Brook Lean-to where I planned to have lunch, I ran into a dozen MATC volunteers.  They were building “A privy to last the ages.”  I thanked each one and then one looked at me and said, “You look familiar.”  It was Tony Barrett who helped organize and publicize my PCT Book talk two weeks ago here in Maine.  It seems like a year ago.  We were both way pleased to meet out in the woods.


 

 (Frodo: Bug netting doesn't flatter you, I'm afraid. Not that it flatters anyone.) 
There was a lot of rough trail today.  Steep up and precipitous downs.  Here’s a photo of steps up to White Cap Mountain.  
 (Frodo: mmmm... sorry, folks, he didn't send me the photo.)
 

White Cap was our biggest climb since Katahdin.  Magnificent views. See the lead photo and below.


 

We didn’t finish hiking until 8:00 pm, after three more rolly coaster ups and downs over Hay Mountain, West Peak, and Gulf Hagas Mountain.  We had a wonderfully convivial group eating dinner in front of the shelter, and a campfire.  Trail chatter, deep talk, trail stories of what each of us has done wrong do far.  One woman journaled how proud she was of herself today.  
 

One woman whom RT and I had met four evenings before at a similar lean-to dinner chatfest said something so dear.  She said that she and her friends had each commented independently that “We hope someday we’ll get to meet Frodo.” (Frodo: Oh, man, now the pressure’s on!  No way can I live up to their expectations after my husband has talked me up!)

 

I guess I weave Frodo into so many of the stories I tell.

 

This is why I come out here – to sit with and be one with these marvelous trail folk making this arduous journey.  No one mentioned their job, their car, or the size of their house.  No mention of politics.  Just deeply honest and richly hilarious talk around the embers of a fire.  IMF, I wish she were here listening, too.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568706,"As you may have already surmised, I am pretty goal oriented.  I set a mark for myself and then work backward, mapping out how to make it happen.  Have 900 hikers stay at our house, over nine weeks, mid-March to mid-May.  Check.  Five days after the last one leaves be ready to set out on my own thru-hike.  Check.  Throw a 40th Anniversary party for ourselves the day after the last hiker left.  Check.
 

SO my goal today  was Cloud Pond Lean-To.  That’s where I calculated I needed to get to today so I can be in Monson late tomorrow.  So what happened?  We’ll get to that…

 

I’m not sure I did a good job capturing how special these hiker conversations are.  Remember your last conversation with someone or with a small group, where afterward you felt so full, so rich; where others had bared their truths (“I’m 37 and today for the first time I really felt proud of myself,” said one woman last night).  Where you bare your own truths.  Where the most outrageous stuff is funny (“And I’d been walking backwards, the wrong way, for an hour!”)  Where you are so tired, beat up and bug bit that you should go to sleep, but you don’t want to.  And where age – 18, 37, or 65 – falls away.  It only simply matters that you are here.  You walked the miles.  Maybe that’s a touch better at explaining to you, now.

 

After the big ford this morning – 150 feet wide, knee deep, I heard something I never expected to hear.  “Scout, you should on if you want to.  Make Monson tomorrow night.”  This was hard hiking.  RT is a trail god, tough as nails, but his knee was swollen and the trail was giving no quarter.  Look at these two photos – the boulder scramble straight up and the all-too-typical roots and rocks. (Frodo:  This is a trail?!?  Man. Thank goodness the designers of the PCT had more sense!)

 
 

I thought hard on this all the way to our lunch shelter, all the hour I waited for RT to arrive.  You have a hiking partner and you stay with them, right?  I’d never leave Frodo.  But then I guess I did for this hike.  She told me it’s okay.  RT doesn’t get personal a lot, but I felt he did at the shelter when he channeled Frodo’s words.  “It’s okay.  Push on to Monson.  Reserve a room for the next day.”

 

In the real world there are “only” six degrees of separation, they say.  Any person in the world can be connected to any other by linking up at most six people.  In the hiking world it seems like it’s just one-and-a-half degrees.  I ran onto trail maintainer Bob Campbell and his daughter today, working ‘his section.”  He gave me fresh apples!  In a minute’s talk he mentions his trail area boss Ron Dobra.  Zen Quake!  Frodo and I hiked with ZQ on the PCT in 2007 and still keep in touch. - - This is the norm in the trail world.

 

As the afternoon wears into dusk, my strength has leaked out.  That lean-to a mile and a half away is my ticket to Monson.  But I’m so tired.  I’m tripping more and there’s a 750-foot climb.  I see a decent stealth campsite.  Would I be giving in?  But then I think of Frodo’s words.  How terrible would I feel if I fell in this last push and really hurt myself?  “Make wise decisions.”  I hear her.  I listen.

 

I am so tired, I can’t motivate myself to cook dinner.  I eat some bars, cheese, and crackers cold. 
 

It sounds like rain is striking my tent.  When I look close I see it’s those awful buggers the blackflies, pinging against the fabric like rain.

 

I set my alarm for 5:10 am.  Maybe if I start hiking at 5:30 I can still make Monson.  Why are wise decisions so hard?

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568784,"I wake at 5:10 am.  There’s still a slim chance to make Monson, the next town.  But there’s 21 miles of the 100-Mile Wilderness between me and a town bed.  The biggest day for me so far on the actual AT was 17.8 miles.
 

How important to me is this journal?  Last night I was asleep before I finished the entry for yesterday.  A first.  I try to religiously finish it the same day.  How important?  I journaled in my tent this morning.  For 20 minutes I was willing to risk Monson, town, a soft bed, dinner.  
 

I finally started walking at 6:10 am.  We’ll see.

 

The day is hot.  Over 90 degrees.  I can’t push water in me fast enough.  I know it’s not a good sign that I don’t need to pee.  I’m not a big sweater, but my shirt is soaked and the waterproof maps in my pocket shine with moisture.

 

I only take a 30-minute lunch.  By 2:00 I have reached 11 miles.   I am racing darkness.  Here is the only switchback I saw in the 100-Mile Wilderness:
 

But I begin to think I may make it.  And at 8:45 pm, I emerge from the woods, the 100-Mile Wilderness behind me.  Monson.

 

At 9:45 I have the best the town has to offer at that hour – gas station pizza.  I down 5 slices.

 

And in my tired glee, my discretion slightly impaired, I will share with you what I saw yesterday.  [princess alert]  At 5:30 pm, smack dab in the middle of the trail, two squirrels were copulating.  Vigorously.  I have photos.  No, Scout, don’t do it!  You’re lucky I’m not that far gone.  But not even 15 minutes later I turned a corner and there are two more squirrels going at it in the middle of the trail.  What’s in the air?

 

Frodo has seen the photos and she will figure out what kind of randy squirrels or chipmunks these were.  (Frodo: They’re just big ground squirrels; definitely not chipmunks.  And I don’t have Scout’s compunctions, so I’ll post the better of the two photos at the bottom.  And there’s spring in the  air – it’s just an evolutionary imperative!)

 

Safe in Monson.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568854,"“Scout, want to see my blackfly slingshot?”  I’d been reading entries in the shelter registers from Mary Poppins for almost all of the 100-Mile Wilderness.  A female, right? No, a bearded guy, a Swede. He’s called Mary Poppins because he carries an umbrella.
 

He’s also called Mary Poppins because he delights in showing people a heavy metal YouTube video of Mary Poppins and Bert the Chimneysweep singing “Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious.” [Princesses, do you dare find it?  We know what happened when you followed my Guy on a Buffalo” YouTube link.]

 

But back to the slingshot.  Every one of us, with our dozen blackfly bites each, would love to devilishly concoct methods of their destruction.  But Mary Poppins has done so. He made his own blackfly slingshot exterminator.

 

If I were to describe breakfast here at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, I’d take up the rest of this entry and have you reaching for your car keys to go out and buy supplies.  So I’ll refrain, but I will give you this photo of Blue Beary pancakes (Frodo: that’s how he wrote it, but I’m not sure it was intentional.) they make piled up in the perfect shape of an AT mountain top rock cairn.

 

Revenge is mine.  Here are my before and after photos of tonight’s heaping plate of pot roast.  The ignominy of my defeat at the Blue Moose over two weeks ago is avenged.

  

It’s been a wonderful zero day.  Packed full of chores, seeing hikers we haven’t seen for days, eating, eating, calling home and loved ones, and eating even more.

 

It’s 11:40 pm as I finish this.  Up at 6:15 to pack up and head back out again tomorrow morning.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569241,"Rolling Thunder and I bump fists, and then I reach out for a hug.  Very non-hiker.  Though we are all close, there’s a strong awareness of the potential to transmit disease.  Hence fist bumps are the norm. 
 

Rolling Thunder is staying behind.  Our paths have diverged.  He wants to slow down.  He got to Monson a half day behind me and will leave at least a half day after me.  We spoke directly about it last night.  With the degree of difference in our desired pace, to try and compromise would just cause friction.  
 

We’re moving on, but it’s a long trail, and who knows?

 

All packed up at 7:00 am, I had a second big breakfast here at Shaws Hostel.  Just like at our house when we host hikers in the spring, Shaws had a sign inside the bathroom, “Please leave the door open when done.”  Our signs say the same thing, but in 18 languages.   (Frodo: Europeans seem to be trained to leave the bathroom door closed behind them, so sometimes you get a line of American hikers lined up outside an empty bathroom!)

 

At 9:00 I was back on trail, hoping to make it to Moxie Bald Shelter, 17.9 miles away.  It was a late start, but the trail gods smiled, and the trail tread was more Dr. Jekyll than Mr. Hyde.  That was important.  Frodo has told me that it’s real important that I reach my next trail town, Rangeley, 106 miles distant, by Monday night.  Six days.  That’s 18-mile days.  “No, it’s 17.6,” she said yesterday (Frodo: I was just KIDDING!  I’m not THAT fussy, even if I am a scientist!)  That stretch has stiff climbs, fords, and the usual AT roots and rocks parade.  Next Monday is our 40th Wedding Anniversary.  I heard in Frodo’s voice yesterday how much she wants me to arrive in town.  (Frodo: Okay, just to set the record straight, this is HIS fault.  When we spoke on the phone a few days ago, he said that he was thinking of an idea for our anniversary, and he suggested that I do the same.  So I did.)  But I also heard in my mind that same voice saying, “Make wise decisions!”  I’ll see if my path cab honor both.

 

If I use the standard set by the 100-Mile Wilderness, today the AT was pretty mild mannered.  We did have three knee-deep fords, for which I stripped off my socks and rolled up my pant legs.  I wouldn’t think of crossing barefoot; absolutely have to have the traction of shoes.  I rolled in to Moxie Bald Lean-To at a pretty civilized 7:30.

 

Frodo, I am on track.  But there are two big mountains to go over tomorrow: Moxie Bald and Pleasant Pond.  It would be ironic if innocuously-named Pleasant Pond Mountain is a bitch. [Should that have been a princess alert?] 
 

The real water hazard today was in the picture-perfect Lake I sat and had dinner next to.  “Scout, here’s one!”  Frostbite had (Frodo: I can’t read the next word) it with a stick in the water.  That pristine body of water harbored ugly, blood-sucking LEECHES!

 

Look at how beautiful the lake was.  
 

Think about this slimy 3-inch pestilence and its brothers attached to your body after a swim.  (Frodo: I’m supposed to put a photo of the leech here, but he hasn’t sent it yet; sorry.  Check back later.)

 

And I had Cracker Jacks for dessert tonight.  Thanks, Frodo.  There was a prize inside, but the prize I really want is….

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569459,"I sense the change and hope it is real.  Maine is a wet state.  If it weren’t this far north it would be a rainforest.  So, so often the trail disintegrates into sucking mud, so wet it will soak your shoes and socks.  Often split logs or risers have been set over these bog traps, or rock stepping stones.  But all it takes is the slightest miss-step and those socks that have just started to dry – boom – soaked again.  Try getting up in the morning, going to the refrigerator and putting on that pair of socks you soaked in ice water overnight. 
 

But today I could feel the bogs drying up.  There was even a stream ford billed as knee deep that I could readily rock hop and stay dry.  Tonight I have blessedly dry socks.

 A snake guarding a rock cairn: 

There were two mountains to climb today – Moxie Bald and the way-too-innocuously-named Pleasant Pond Mountain.  But at the top of the second I had a moment of cell coverage, and the trail does pass within yards of the town of Caratunk in 7 miles, and the hostel there does make milkshakes.  No brainer.  
 

I write this lying on a bed, not an air mattress.  I got in at 7:45 and had that milkshake, made on a 1955 Hamilton Beach milkshake mixer.  And I will be out of here bright and early after a family-style breakfast tomorrow.  I remain on track for Rangeley on the 19th.  
 

I’ve heard in Frodo’s voice that she really didn’t believe the degree of difficulty of some of this trail tread.  Until she saw photos of some of the near-vertical rock scramble that masquerades as a trail.  Now she’s filled with righteous indignation, mostly aimed at the builders of the AT in this area.  “You call that a trail???”

 Two of my hiking cohort: Dot and Frankenfoot
 
Scat, turds, poo, poop. Rolling Thunder saw bear scat, some even fresh, on the International AT, our first 140 miles.  But we’ve seen none since on the AT.  We’ve seen moose turd clusters by the bucketful, the barrelful.  And on that topic, Mary Poppins, who is Swedish, says when you put “moose turd” into Google translate, the wise silicon brain reports in German, “elk pigeons.”  Go figure.  But nothing explains the [princess alert] shit I saw today.  Half-size versions of the moose standard ovoid.  I figure it’s either the near-extinct Maine pigmy moose or the world’s largest rabbit.  (Frodo: Umm… maybe deer turds?)

 

Or maybe my mind was clouded by the thought of a milkshake at the end of my day.  One hundred and fifty yards off the trail, 18.8 miles done and I walk into Paul’s hiker hostel.  Paul hiked the PCT in 1994!  And again over ’04 and ’05.  As I sip my milkshake we trade PCT stories while he  makes me a hamburger.  Eat, Scout, eat….. Happy on the AT.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569618,"Did I tease someone? Did I tempt fate?  I wasn't trying to. I was just trying to share with you how things were changing. The bogs were gone. There was so much less mud.
The heavy rain started in the middle of the night. A Maine-type downpour, where heavy means buckets. And light means what we call heavy in San Diego. 
 I had a warm, homemade breakfast, farm potatoes with fried onions, three slices of French toast slathered in butter and powdered sugar, and three slices of bacon. A little different from the packet of pop tarts I would have talked into my shirt pocket, my ""warming drawer.""   I packed up without thinking about what it was doing outside, except everything inside my pack was put inside a waterproof stuff sack or trash compactor bag. What little I needed access to was put in my pockets. 
 Paul and I traded more PCT stories while he cooked. in 2004, Paul stayed with San Diego trail angel Bob Riess.  It was two years before Frodo and I hosted our first hiker. Unprompted, Paul vividly recounted the 60 mile drive out in Bob's van to Campo, the PCT start. ""On  One sharp turn, the van had only two wheels on the ground,"" he swore. Bob is a great guy, but Paul is far from the only one to claim that their most harrowing moment on their PCT thru/hike was that initial drive out with Bob. 
 All packed, rain pants and jacket on, pack wrapped in its rain cover, I slipped out the door, umbrella up in one hand and trekking pole in the other. Pretty much my stance all day. 
Mary Poppins geared up for rain. 
 Here's one photo of how bad the trail had filled with water. 

 But at the same time, there were three stretches with oh-so-civilized walkways over bogs. 

 And we did have stretches where the trail was more like it was channeling the PCT - few years roots and rocks and reasonable grade. 
 We crossed the Kennebec River, 200 feet wide, The AT authorities require hikers to use a canoe ferry The they provide. Hikers have died trying to ford the river. I was first across this morning. This time of year it's only manned from 9 to 11 AM.   But today they closed early after only 10 hikers, due to wind-webbed waves and the rain.
Lunch was in the lean-to four miles out. There were nine  of us, wet  rats stripping off sodden clothes, each in our own few square feet of the wooden, dry floor space. I even took out my stove and whipped up a pot of hot chocolate to warm my core. After an hour and a half I re-put on my sodden socks and shoes for the 10 miles to the next shelter.
 Sure the trail was wet, bogs fully replenished, but most of that 10 miles was good tread and for the last few miles the umbrella was held closed in my hand.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569756,"It rained all night and at 3:30 am I reached down to the foot of the tent and felt water.  Then I realized that it had soaked my hiking shirt and pants.  What will I wear tomorrow?  I’d already been stressing about reaching Rangeley in three days.  Now this.
 

From then on I woke every 20 minutes, gnawing away at the same question.  What I decided was to hike in my sleeping clothes – cardinal sin – my long underwear bottoms and top.  I’d wear my rain jacket and rain pants over them.  
 

The rain lightened up and then stopped while I was folding up the tent.  Those wet hiking clothes weighed heavy in my pack.  
 

In the first shelter 7 miles later, I hung them up to start drying and sat down to eat an early first lunch.  Sweet young Dot all but lectured me, “You put that shirt and pants on and you wear them dry.  You never wear your sleep clothes on trail!”  And ladies, get ready to cringe.  By way of example, Dot was wearing her wet sports bra.  She’d been an outdoor trek leader at her college and for a moment I felt, even at age 65 with 10,000+ hiking miles under my belt, like one of her wayward students.

 

I packed up after lunch and – cringe, cringe – put on the cold and wet shirt and pants.  And you know what?  Within 15 minutes they were semi warm and within 2 hours they were a rough semblance of dry.

 

This old dog is always open to learning new tricks.

 

And under that Maine gray sky, without rain, we got our first climb done before lunch and then took on the long 2000+ foot push to the top of the two Bigelows.  We rose above the clouds, sun out.  Glorious views.

 

We’d left strong hikers from the lean-to behind, camping at mile 13.  Myself and Dot, Frankenfoot, and Frostbite were pushing on to Horns Pond Lean-tos.  They were vocal about what a long, hard day it had been, expressing my own silent thoughts.  These young folks are so strong, and they are going in to town tomorrow.  I face two days ahead, over a mile longer each day.

 

At the top of Bigelow Mountain in the sun a local had pointed out my path ahead, peak by peak, and when I told him my schedule, two 19-mile days, he said in understated New England-ish, “That’s ambitious.”

 

Heading into Horns I decided.  I have to heed my own advice, just as I’d listened to Dot.  “Don’t push too hard at the beginning of a hike,” I’d told scores of our starting PCT hikers.  I am letting go of the goal to get to Rangeley on our anniversary. Frodo, forgive me.  “Make wise decisions.”  That’s what my love says to me, too.  I hope she’ll understand.  
 

Thankful to be dry.  Thankful to be sleeping in a lean-to.  First time on my AT hike.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569795,"My father is a great man.  No. not the kind of great that will show up in history books, but the kind of great who bought a new Prius at age 92.  The kind of great who, after he lost his shirt in a business venture when I was 3, sold the house he had built with his own hands, paid off his debts, and got an early-morning job – starting at 4:00 am – so my mom could work as a supermarket clerk at decent daytime hours after Dad got home.  That way no one else would have to watch us kids.  Most of all, I knew and I know, that Dad loves me with all his heart.
Ten years ago, before my first thru-hike (Frodo: Ahem... before your BEST thru-hike), I knew Dad thought our hiking was meshuggeneh (Yiddish for crazy, daft), but he went down to the library and checked out all five books they had on the PCT and started to read them.  He wanted to understand what his son was doing.  He and Mom were quick to offer, “Is there any important piece of equipment that the two of you don’t have yet, that we can buy for you?” 
Dad turns 93 in July.  If he were here right now, his first words would be, “Happy Sunday!”  Well, “Happy Sunday” right back at you, Dad, and “Happy Fathers Day,” too. 
On top of North Crocker Peak I was able to reach Dad, though the call was interrupted three times when I lost cell service.  I also reached Frodo.  She had just spilled the beans by text.  The surprise would be the one surprised, and all those I’d enlisted to help me were in fact double agents serving her plot.  More of that in a moment.
I had a Fathers’ Day gift from the universe today.  I third of the way up the tough climb to the top of Crocker Peak, I’d stopped to tank up on the last water – a thumbnail-sized spring – and a woman hiker tucked in behind me.  We told stories the rest of the climb up, which made it infinitely less painful.  I got to tell her about my Dad, about our wedding anniversary tomorrow, and the First Great Story of our Marriage (How Frodo and I met).  We pulled each other to the top.  What a gift. 
But let’s go way back to that morning when I got flipped around and walked a mile back in the wrong direction.  I told you it was Frodo’s fault because I was thinking about her, but I didn’t tell you what I was thinking about.  I’d hatched a plan to have our anniversary day in San Diego unfold for her  in a series of surprises.  A neighbor/friend would show up at 8:15am with mimosas.  The big surprise of the day would be next, our daughter Nicky, who lives in DC (Frodo: as do all three of our San Diego-raised kids – go figure), would make a surprise visit and take Frodo to breakfast and then go to line dancing class with her.  A friend would take her to lunch and a movie, then her sister would take her for a mani/pedi and dinner, then my brother and his wife would take her to the theater to see a play.  All these arrangements I’d made during my zero day in Monson.  (Frodo: sounds like it would have been a lovely but exhausting day.  I have a VERY sweet husband.)  I had it so carefully worked out.  Each person was sworn to keep it secret from Frodo. 
All the while, each of them knew something I did not: Frodo was going to fly to Maine to surprise me with a zero at a B&B in Rangeley.  That’s why it was so important to her that I come out Monday evening.  
Today, from the Atlanta airport she ‘fessed up.  When I told her yesterday that I wouldn’t make it to the highway until Tuesday, she decided to hike in 8 miles on Monday to surprise me at the campsite she figured I would camp at.  So she packed up her backpacking gear (Frodo: including a tent in case we didn’t connect) in addition to the already-packed suitcase.  But then when she called the proprietor of the B&B from the San Diego airport this morning, he warned her of severe weather, two inches of rain predicted in Monday night’s thunderstorms, and said, “No one in their right mind would choose to hike in on Monday!”  So now she plans to hike in a couple miles on Tuesday late morning to meet me.  I CAN’T WAIT.
She hoped maybe I could indeed hustle out on Monday, but that won’t happen.  So she encouraged me to stay where I will have a roof over my head, so my plan is to camp tomorrow night at the Poplar Ridge Lean-To, about 11 miles before the highway. 
Today we crossed a highway after 5 miles and I took a brief break at the side of the road.  I needed to sew up my pants.  No, I didn’t tear them, I needed to take in the waist because I’m losing weight (Frodo: NO!) and they’re too baggy.  A car pulled up and I had my first classic AT trail magic.  It was Mark, the Chief of Police from a nearby town.  He and his wife put up hikers at their home occasionally, gratis.  No, I didn’t need a ride, but he gave me a huge handful of grapes, still cold-crisp from the fridge.
I read a guidebook over dinner tonight and it says the following about this section that Frodo wanted me to push through: “These 32 miles are the most difficult along the AT in Maine….Do not underestimate the time and effort needed to traverse this section.” 
Finally, I texted our three kids from the top of Crocker Mountain.  “Please send me a photo of each of you.  I love you.”  Within minutes I had all three photos.  Here they are.  (Frodo: Um... Photobucket has not been cooperating these past couple days, so I’m not sure when these will actually be posted.  I’ll keep trying, I promise.)  Happy Fathers Day, all!
Frodo: Okay, not sure what the problem is with photobucket, but I've uploaded the photos of our kids and the trail magic photo to trailjournals.  If you click on ""photos"" in the menu along the left side, you can see them.","Horns Pond Lean-to

 I pushed through the first big climb this morning and began the second at 12:30.  Like a child being punished, I skipped lunch (Frodo: WHO does that to a child??).  The first thunderclap came booming as I started up that second big climb.  But it was still sunny!  At that point the shelter was 3 miles ahead.  The first drops fell at 1:00.  Within minutes the thunder was non-stop and the rain was coming down in buckets.
 “Shelter, shelter, shelter.”  Put one foot in front of the other.  On the steep bouldery parts of the climb I crept upward, trying not to fall. 
Walking up to the shelter and standing under the roof was such a vast relief.  I am in my dry sleep clothes now.  My wet clothes hang from nails in the log frame overhead. 
I am now set up to hike 10 miles to get to the highway, to see Frodo tomorrow.  She actually plans to hike in 2 miles and meet me at the next shelter.  I don’t want this to come across as mean, but I hope those two miles include at least a good taste of how difficult this Maine trail tread can be.  Frodo, I am not a slacker.  You just really can’t pile on the miles out here, like you can on the PCT and often the CDT.
Frodo admonished me that I should get too gushy, so I’ll just share one slice of what I was thinking today on our 40th Wedding Anniversary. 
I have long said that the three happiest days of my life were the days each one of our kids were born.  Recently at a book event where I was going to mention that our 40th anniversary was coming up, I planned to say that the three best days of my life were our kids’ births and that the next best was our wedding day 40 years ago.  But I found that the words stuck in my throat.  The truth is the most important event in my life was meeting and marrying Frodo.  Our wedding day was definitely the happiest day of my life.

10.7 miles to the road.  9 miles to the lean-to that she will hike in to, to meet me.  On the Pacific Crest Trail we speak of doing a “ten by ten,” ten miles by 10:00 am.  That’s a term I’ve never heard out here on the AT.  Ahead od me I have three stiff Maine climbs, up over The Horn, Saddleback Junior and Saddleback Mountain.  When I start there is more blue sky than clouds.  Promising!   
 The first drops begin on the first climb.  Single drops become families, become crowds, become rioting hordes.  The dry granite becomes wet, then soaked, and the steep-stepped path up becomes its own torrent.  Head down, I celebrate each summit as I reach it.
 The downpour made me feel like I was either in Maine or in a monsoon.  I fell 14 times, not dainty slips, but hard banana-peel falls on greased-bowling-ball granite.  These 14 pratfalls are more than the total number of falls I had on the entire PCT in five months.  (Frodo: He does not look like a happy camper.)     (Photobucket is stilll not working.  photos can be accessed using the ""photos""button to the left or follow these to links: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... and http://www.trailjournals.com/j... ) But improbably after the third summit the sun came out.  Glories.  I had such views.  I whooped for joy.  I was headed down to see my love.

Frodo and I have now completed our “Gift of the Magi” moment.  I discussed this in an earlier post.  During my last zero day I had arranged for a series of family and friends to spend the day with Frodo, bringing her a mimosa, taking her out for a mani-pedi, out to the theater, etc.  But all these people were double agents.  Frodo was going to surprise me by showing up at the trailhead that day.  When tough trail and bad weather slowed my pace so I wouldn’t get to the road on our Anniversary, Frodo ‘fessed up from the Atlanta airport.  Neither of our plans came off as originally envisioned.  But when I saw her at 1:30 and we hugged, none of that mattered a bit.  It’s a day after our 40th and both of us feel very cherished.","Poplar Ridge Lean-To

 Today is Hike Naked Day.  The summer solstice.  (I know, I think the solstice this year actually occurred yesterday, but most people think it always happens on the 21st.). Just thought I'd throw that out there.  No, Scout is not naked.  At least not now.  If I were hiking the AT today the last thing I would want would be to hike with no clothes on.  I don't think even slathering myself with insect repellent would be sufficient to ward off all the nasty bugs in these woods.  Not sure how many AT hikers observe the tradition these days, though I'm told it started on the AT.  Even on the wonderful, well-designed, viewful, gently-graded, relatively kind-treaded and less buggy and boggy PCT, it's not easy to hike clothes-less for the day.  (In case you haven't noticed, I have come to appreciate the PCT's many wonderful attributes more as I compare them to what I have learned about the AT.) 
Scout is currently parked at the dining room table of the very warm and welcoming B&B we are staying at in Rangeley, Maine.  The guy at the car rental counter called this ""God's country.""  It is lovely - verdant and with lots of tall purple lupine, beautiful lakes all around.  Anyway, Scout is busy emailing folks because he likes to stay in touch with friends and family while he's thru-hiking, and he wants to respond to everyone who has wished him well. A near-impossible task, since there are many dozens.  The guy is just so likable and well-liked.  Biased, are we?
He’s got hardly any tush left, so he’s working on eating as much as he can handle.  [Scout: Princesses do you know what a tush is? How does my tush end up in this journal. I'll bet your parents just call it your bottom or rear end. (If Frodo can make comments in my entries.

Yesterday Scout texted Dot and Frankenfoot and told them I’m here and would like a chance to meet some of his hiking buddies.  If they could arrive this evening we’d love to take them out to dinner and provide a ride back to the neat hostel near the trailhead.  They replied that they would try to make it by 5:30, and they arrived right on the dot!  We stopped by the hostel to drop off their stuff and let them clam the cottage Scout had reserved for them, and the owner showed us these very cool moths that had recently emerged from their pupae.http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
We had a congenial dinner at the local Italian/pizza restaurant and I enjoyed getting to know them and telling some of our own PCT trail stories.  Great folks.  You know, when we hiked the PCT, I thought it was going to be all about the scenery (of which there’s a lot more variety and mountain crags than on the AT) and the physical challenge.  But it’s really about the people you meet and get to know.  99% of long-distance hikers are wonderful people.

I hike out in new shoes after I hug Frodo and hear her exhort me one more time, ""Make wise decisions!""  I got nearly 500 miles out of my first pair, including training hikes.  
 I had not realized that I'd been unintentionally torturing myself. I filter water with a Sawyer squeeze - fill a one-liter bottle from a brook or lake, attach the Sawyer Squeeze and then squeeze the bottle, driving fluid through the filter in a stream into my water bladder.  This has become a time-consuming, pain-in-the-hands chore.  Frodo found me a new one in town and it now takes me a quarter of the time with a quarter of the effort.  Why did I wait so long?
 Sunny hiking and lake hopping--climb one moderate rise and drop down again to another lake.  One lake had a canoe, paddles, and life preserver set for use.  Another lake had a rustic writing desk just waiting for me to sit down. 
 I met a half dozen northbounders, including Data, who stayed with us in 2015 before starting the PCT.  “I know you."" 
Miscellaneous: They say that DEET will dissolve plastic.  The other day Dot sprayed DEET-based insect repellent on her legs and a short time later rested a plastic food package across her lap.  When she lifted it up, some of the words from the plastic label had transferred to her legs.  What I don’t get is that it’s not okay for plastic, but it’s okay for our skin?
With 14 miles down and nearly 4 to go, the first big climb looms ahead.  As I stood still for a moment, Cuckoo came up.  Lucky for the both of us.  We pounded up steadily, fueled by each other’s stories, like on Fathers Day.  How is it possible that it almost seems painless?  We’re in the Bemis Mountain Lean-to.  She’s reading Annie Proulx’s Shipping News and I’m on page 350 of John Irving’s Cider House Rules.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570434,"Pouring rain.  But on the roof of the shelter.  My 5:30 alarm goes off.  I essentially ignore it.  Wring yourselves out, clouds.  I lie here and listen to the intensity lessen.  At 6:30 I move and begin my morning routine.  I hike out at 7:40 in a light shower.
 We have a series of modest climbs. Modest for Maine, that is.  No complaints from me.  The view from the last, Old Blue Mountain, is supposed to be awesome.  I can’t see a thing.  But I’m joyous nonetheless.  The rain has stopped.  I put away my umbrella.
 Have you ever wondered why I don’t mention the height of these peaks?  This particular punishing massif was 3600 feet!  By West Coast standards, that’s a nub on a wart attached to the lower limb below the shoulder of mountains like San Jacinto, Baden Powell, or Whitney.  But if the category is degree of difficulty to walk up, these Maine contenders punch far above their weight class.
 On Old Blue Mountain my revelry is shattered.  I have a moment of smart phone coverage.  The email said that the son of a good friend, married only two weeks, had lost his wife to a bear mauling.  She was a field geologist in Alaska.  Married for so little time, so young, so, so wrong.  I was able to raise Frodo.  She was worried as soon as she heard the tone of my voice.  I just needed to hear hers, to tell her I love her.  I sent a text to our three kids and their spouses/significant other: We love each one of you greatly.  I sent a text to my friend and she responded. 
 What is wrong with the universe?
 I reach my goal for the day at 6:00 pm sharp, the Hall Mountain Lean-to.  I share it with one other SOBO (southbounder).  We seem to be in a bit of a bubble, not many in front of us.  We’re more in the leading edge than I’d have thought.  My goal for tomorrow is Grafton Notch, 16.3 miles ahead, where our son Sean is picking me up.  We will overnight at the home of a friend of Sean’s from college. (Dartmouth, which is right on the AT – the trail actually runs alongside the campus.)  I’ll get town food, a shower, and a bed. 
Early the next morning Sean will head out with me for four days in the White Mountains.  On each of my other thru-hikes he joined me once by himself and once with his girlfriend/wife.  I’m greatly looking forward to it.
 The Maine/New Hampshire border is in 31 miles.  I will definitely be ready for another state.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570468,"Some of you may have noticed that I let June 21st pass without notice.  It was the day Frodo and I were in Rangeley, a full zero day.  But as Ron Dumoff pointed out to me, “Scout, how could you let Hike Naked Day pass?”  (Frodo: unbeknownst to Scout when he wrote this, I had addressed Hike Naked Day in the entry I wrote for that day.)
For those of you uninitiated, Hike Naked Day is the summer solstice and the traditional day on the AT and the PCT to bare your all, at least at some point during the day.  On the PCT we were with a convivial group that day (Frodo: I was the sole female among 5 males!) and we stripped down long enough to take some tasteful-ish photos.  (Frodo: not very long, but I still got three mosquito bites on tender flesh!  I’ll post a photo when I have access to the computer on which they are stored.)
 But, Ron, hike naked with these blackflies?  But they, Frodo, and I were in town and any naked-getting will NOT be described in this journal.
 But back to this day, June 24th. My alarm went off at 4:20 and I set out at 5:00 am.  It didn’t rain last night and when I got up to go pee I saw stars. 
 What I didn’t see was…. Well, let’s backtrack a moment.  I grew up in West L. A., in Culver City.  The only place I’d ever seen fireflies was in movies and in Disneyland’s Pirates of the Caribbean.  I didn’t see my first firefly until age 21.  Not all things are as amazing as you imagine.  Fireflies lived up to every ounce of their hype.
 So another way this AT hike would be different -  I’d hike into firefly country.  This morning Cuckoo swears she saw fireflies when she woke last night.  Why not me, too?
 After I started hiking, within a quarter mile the sky made up its mind.  Rain.  Lots. Sigh.
 Why’d I start so early?  Our son Sean is picking me up at the trailhead 16.3 miles away and we’re staying overnight with a college chum of his, Cathy and her husband and their three little ones.  I had felt close to Cathy when Sean was in college and I want to squeeze in every ounce of visiting time with the family before the kids turned in.  “Sean, I’ll be there around 5:30 pm.”  Hiking all day, a foreshortened lunch, and at 5:33 I walked into the Grafton Notch parking lot.
 As I get ready to turn out the light I have chicken they raised in my belly, local salad greens, bread slathered with butter, pan-blackened asparagus, and not one, but two, bowls of ice cream digesting in my gut.
 Still, when I borrowed shorts to wear while my clothes are washed, I too easily fit into a pair of shorts with a waist size a full 2 inches down from my normal 34.
 Eat, Scout, eat. 
 Tomorrow I start hiking with my firstborn.  One more way that I am a lucky man.","Hall Mountain Lean-To

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570531,"(Frodo: I have finally received several journal entries and I'm trying to catch up by posting two per day.  Since the default set-up is to open the most recent entry whenever you go to Scout's trailjournal website, make sure you don't miss a day.)
I had bacon with breakfast this morning at Sean’s friend’s home.  Alex and Cathy raise their own chickens and pigs.  Last night it was barbeque chicken, theirs.  And this morning the butter and blueberry pancakes were accompanied by home applewood-cured from-their-own-pig bacon.  One taste of this and the faithless would be believe there must be a god in heaven.  What is it that Farmer John and Hormel sell that’s labelled “bacon”?  We started eating at 6:15 and didn’t get back on the trail till 8:30.  A huge thanks to Cathy, Alex, and their three delightful munchkins.
But why is this nice Jewish boy singing paeans to bacon?  Good question.  Back to that later.

Sean and I planned 14 miles today.  It sets up the next day at a Gorham Hiker Hostel, the following night at the on-trail AMC Carter Notch Hut and then Frodo meets us the day after (whoo hoo!).  But, and this is a big but, I didn’t know until breakfast that today’s Mahoosuc Notch is called “THE WORST MILE ON THE AT.”  Oops.

Sean and I had a stiff 2500-foot climb right off, but mid-day brought a string of glorious views.  Mid-afternoon we precipitously drop and at 4:00 pm we enter – cue battle scene music from Star Wars – The Notch.  Big reaches with arms, long extensions of legs, rebar rungs, narrow slots we have to take our packs off to slide through.  We slow to a crawl, a creep.  Is it possible to even cover a mile at this pace?

Two hours.  Two hours without let up.  We emerge at the other end of the huge boulder jumble Notch.  My son and I have traversed the AT’s hardest.  We pull into Full Goose Shelter at 7:30, four miles shy of our goal.  We are done in.  We have only another hour of good daylight left.  “Make wise decisions.”  Tonight we stay here. 
And to end the day with visions of bacon.  I eat bacon but no other pork because of West Union, Iowa.  During the depression my maternal grandparents, Orthodox Jews, were the only Jewish family in the town of 3000.  My grandfather was the furrier and scrap metal dealer.  There was no kosher butcher, of course, but my grandparents decided their kids still had to eat meat to be healthy – beef and bacon.  No other pork.  (Frodo: It doesn’t really make sense that bacon would be on the list, but this was Iowa, known for corn and pigs, and I think Scout’s mom said something about her parents being told that bacon contributed to a child’s strength.)  My mother passed the habit on to me.  I’ve never had ham and no other park product has passed my lips.  Yes, you are absolutely right; it makes no sense.

But some might say the same thing about hiking from Maine to Georgia.","Grafton Notch
",Full Goose Shelter,"Jun 25, Sun",10
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570562,"We start hiking at 5:00 am.  There is the slenderest of chances we can make it to Gorham.  If we don’t start in this dim-lit hour the chance is zero, zilch.  If we don’t make it to Gorham we have no chance to make it the next day to Carter Notch Hut, run by the Appalachian Mountain Club, where we have bed, dinner, and breakfast reserved and paid for.  But Gorham is 21 miles away.
The Mahoosuc Notch yesterday set us back 4 miles.  So today’s planned 17, still a big big day, has turned into 21.  But should we even try?  This is only Sean’s second day on the trail with me, and maybe I should remember that I’m 65.

(Frodo: It’s taking some time for us to realize and accept that the 20 to 25+ mile days we were comfortable with on the PCT and Scout usually did on the CDT are well-nigh impossible in these mountains of Maine and New Hampshire.  We’re told it should get easier in Vermont.)

After some slow going, at mid-morning we get a boost.  We’re at the Maine- New Hampshire State Line!  I have hiked all of Maine.  Do any of you ever get choked up at a state border?  Try hiking 430 miles to it.  I am glad Sean is there.  I hug him and dampen one shoulder.  
I took a brief moment to take a photo of this lake with lily pads: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
(Frodo: I'll bet it also had leeches....)
By the way, do I write too much about food?  Frodo has told me to limit my gushing about her, many people have told me no more foot photos, but what about all these tributes to town food?  Are you tired of intimately described pot roast and tributes to bacon?

Let’s highlight some differences between this trail and the other two I’ve hiked, the PCT and CDT.

1) At night your dinner doesn’t cool down so fast, so you don’t have to bolt it.  On the AT my dinner pot cools slowly because, unlike the other two trails, the temperature doesn’t plummet when the sun goes down.  Here it swings down mildly and has yet to head south of 45°.

2) Spiders. On the PCT and CDT I was often the first person on the trail and I would often catch spiderwebs across my face – they’d stick to my moustache and eyebrows.  Here it is very rare.  Where are all the spiders? (Frodo: Ahem… I was usually the first on the trail, since Scout usually let me set the pace.  But given my lack of height, he still got spiderwebs in the face – we both did.  Every once in a while, when they were particularly bad, I’d walk with one arm reaching up high, to clear those spiderwebs for him.)

3)  Lastly, let’s talk about boogers, hardened snot.  [Hey, princesses, do you like to hear your parents say “boogers”?]  Out here I never pick my nose on trail.  Admit it, you PCT and CDT hikers, we are always  picking our nose out there.  It’s so dry and the snot hardens to nostril-narrowing boogers.  We get mini nosebleeds in the elevation, and the fine dust mingles with the snot to make eminently pickable boogers.  Not here.  No dust (everything’s too wet), high humidity, and no 10,000-foot-plus elevations.

But back to this day.  We did a ten-by-two.  We hit 10 miles by 2:00 pm, when we finally had a short lunch.  By 4:00 pm we’d been walking 11 hours and we were at 13.  We kept moving.  Even if we hiked in the dark, would it be possible?  We hit the last mountain before Gorham, 3.8 miles out, at 7:30.  We called White Mountain Hiker Hostel.  “Yes, you can come in after 10:00 pm.”

We turned our headlamps on at 9:00 pm.  We hit the road with under a mile left at 9:30.  Then we spotted blinking lights,  Swamp gas?  Are we seeing things because we skipped dinner and have been hiking nearly 17 hours straight?

No.  Those are fireflies.  Fireflies!  What a perfect end to this arduous day.

Or maybe the pizza delivered at 10:40 pm was the perfect end.

Or maybe the shower was the perfect end.

Or maybe the perfect end was at 6 minutes past midnight, finishing up today’s journal.  I put my heart into it.  I sleep well when I’ve reached out to each of you this way.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570660,"What a lovely night’s sleep.  I’m wrapped in a soft quilt on the bottom bunk and it’s early morning.  From above me I hear the rhythmic breathing of my son.  Both of us were wiped from yrsterday’s 21-mile, 17-hour hiking day.  But nighttime and sleep perform miracles as our bodies recover.
We have 15.2 hard miles today, but “hard” is a relative term, its meaning stretched like silly putty after The Most Difficult Mile and after yesterday’s crazy 21-mile day.  Today we know we  can make this: Gorham to the northernmost of the AMC’s string of 8 staffed huts, Carter Notch Hut.  Almost civilized.
In addition to the waffles and the butter, there was Skippy John Jones t the table.  I haven’t seen him in three weeks, since two days after Katahdin. He was in fine fettle, had news of other hikers, and he and Sean traded stories about their respective service in Afghanistan.  Do you remember that Skippy names all, yes every piece, of his gear.  I said hello again to Priscilla and Penelope, his trekking poles.  Here are the three of us humans: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Our 3200-foot climb wasn’t as tough as it might have been.  The first two miles of trail, as often is true near a trailhead, was fairly civilized.  And then the first half of the gain, when it was stair-step steep, was occupied talking with a young SOBO, Ethan or Stringbean, whom I hadn’t seen in ten days.  
Seam and I had a civilized lunch, too.  Pizza leftovers from last night in sunshine and with great views.

Of course at day’s end, with a sheer drop descent – 1700 feet in a mile – the sky unloaded hail on us at the top of Carter Dome.  Careful, careful.  New Hampshire granite is slick when wet.  The sight of Carter Notch Hut’s stone building, the happy faces inside with five picnic tables and a kitchen were so welcome when we rolled in at 7:20 pm.  That was almost three hours earlier than last night’s quitting time.  So civilized.  Here we are at dinner: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Finally, I saw my face for the first time in days in a mirror.  I have a shooting star scab on my cheek.  Three days ago there was a collision between a branch and my cheek.  Boy, did it bleed.  But it left me with a beautiful (Frodo: ???!!???) shooting star on my cheek. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

",Carter Notch Hut,"Jun 27, Tue",15.20
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570752,"We sat down to breakfast here at Carter Notch Hut and they brought out a heaping platter of …  No, Scout, enough about food!  They’re tired of it.
In 6.1 miles more I will see Frodo again … No, Scout, enough about Frodo; they’ve had their fill of how besotten you are with her.

So I’ll tempt fate and talk about trail instead.  We love trail out here, as sensitive to it as a cat is with its whiskers, as a bat is with the sonar it uses to find bugs.  So, since we’ve crossed the border into New Hampshire, all our senses have turned to the question – is there any difference in the trail?  Yes.  (This better not come back to bite me.)  First, New Hampshire must have a scarcity of white paint. The ever-present white blazes we see on trees and rocks – literally every 100 to 200 feet, every change of trail direction marked with two AT white blazes, one on top of the other – they now are spaced out a few hundred yards or more.  Wooden junction signs use other trail names.  Are they ashamed of the AT?  But the biggest difference is oh-so-subtle.  The worst parts of the trail, those steep, near-vertical-feeling rises and falling-off-a-cliff descents, are ever-so-slightly less devilish and severe.  (Frodo:  NOOOO!!!!  Now you’ve done it.  I’m certain that as you wrote this the trail for the rest of New Hampshire has re-arranged itself and is now much more steep and difficult than it was a few days ago.  You jinxed yourself, I’m sure.)  In Maine there would be a series of places where you would need all four appendages and you’d wish for a fifth, like a monkey’s tail, to pull yourself up.  Here the ascent is as steep, but they have painstakingly put in steps.  Yes, irregular and gut-busting, but steps.  And when this trail carries you over slanted open granite slabs, so prone to causing falls when wet, here the slabs are slightly less canted, a smidgen safer.  
Maybe climbing Mt. Washington and the Presidentials (sounds like an old rock & roll band) will blow my New Hampshire trail theory to smithereens.  We’ll see.

Frodo’s hair is like spun silk, her hazel eyes like jewels in a display case…. Enough! (Frodo: Pretty funny, typing this up.  Ha!)

What’s 6.1 miles?  It’s the distance from Carter Notch Hut to Pinkham Notch.  It’s a 10K.  Didn’t I once do a 10K race in 39 minutes and 42 seconds?  We’ll be hiking up and over the Wildcats.  The map calls them Wildcat A, Wildcat B, through Wildcat E.  A roller coaster of wildcats.  The names re reminiscent of Dr. Seuaa.  Remember The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, and little cats A, B, C, D, etc.?  And they were bad hombres (Frodo: Um… I think that was Thing 1 and Thing 2, but I could be wrong.  It’s been a while)  These Wildcats, with their ups and downs and rocky steps, were poised to slap us.  But Stringbean, a just-out-of-college SOBO, had attached himself as our caboose and we chatted (rather we talked between huffing breaths) and the first half passed nicely before he pushed ahead.  
Here's me appreciating the scenery before the rain started: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Imagine a 10K race with a 1700-foot vertical drop in only a mile.  We were able to see below us the visitor center and cafeteria at Pinkham Notch for quite a while.

Finally, with a mile left as we negotiated big wet rocks on the last of the vertical drop, a voice called up, “Be careful.”  Frodo.  At last.

My newly-torn pants - yes, one more fall, my first face-forward, hands-out-in-front, downhill one – and the associated cuts and bruises don’t matter.

We have lunch in the spacious AMC Visitor Center and watch the downpour (we had good timing for once!) drown the parking lot.  I write three postcards to the princesses.

(Frodo: I planned to hike more than that first mile, but when in the spattery rain I saw that steep rocky uphill I thought, “Good lord, I would be so slow going down those slippery rocks!” and decided that discretion was the better part of valor under the circumstances.  Here is what it looked like, though the photo doesn't do justice to the steepness: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  SoI just leaned against a tree (the rocks were all covered with wet moss) and waited for about 45 minutes.  It was VERY good to see the two of them.  As for Scout writing to the princesses while he ate lunch: I saw how little he ate as he wrote the first one (and how hard it would be for the poor girl to read) and I took over the writing while he dictated and ate more efficiently.)

A nearo day (a day in which you hike less than ten miles) and then a zero.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570801,"Entry by Frodo, so Scout can get other things done.
 We are staying in the vacation condo of an outdoor sports enthusiast.  Mike hiked the southernmost section of the PCT early this past winter, but we didn’t host him in San Diego.  We were unavailable, but our good friends Jan and Jim stepped up and took wonderful care of him.  Then Jan remembered that he has a condo up here near the AT and so she pretty much asked him if we could use it.  Mike also is a serious biker and runner and skier, and we look forward to meeting him this evening when he comes up to start the long holiday weekend.  In the meantime, we are enjoying the condo and finding it much more amenable than a motel room for all the things we need to do.  Many thanks to Mike. 
So what does a typical zero day look like for Scout?  He is not really your typical AT thru- hiker, so don’t extrapolate this to anyone else. 
Scout spends some time on the phone – calling his parents, his brother and sister, our kids, often a friend or two.  These tend to be fairly long conversations.
Scout spends a lot of time on the laptop computer.  He reads emails and feels compelled to answer every single one.  Sometimes, if I’m there and put my foot down, or if he runs out of time, he doesn’t get them all answered and then he feels bad.  Some of that is on me, but he does need to eat and sleep and even relax a little bit.  He also uploads all the photos he’s taken since his last opportunity to upload, and he chooses the ones he wants to accompany his trailjournal entries.
He makes sure he’s up-to-date on his handwritten journal and hands the pages to me to transcribe.
Speaking of relaxing, I brought the most recent Time magazine and Scout spent maybe an hour reading that while he ate lunch.  That’s his typical MO at home – he likes to read the newspaper or a magazine while he eats lunch.  But on his other two thru-hikes he has actively avoided hearing the news.  I remember in September of 2015 on the CDT someone let slip something about Trump’s campaign and Scout said that his campaign wasn’t real, it was just a joke, ‘cause Scout hadn’t been following the news.  He has been saying that this hike will be different than the others, not just in the type of terrain, the frequency of towns, and the fact that I won’t be around much, but in his approach as well.  So he’s not avoiding the news this time. Oh, and he's shaving, too.
Still speaking of relaxing, we walked to the complex’s Sports Club (in the rain, which fell most of the day) and soaked in the hot tub for a while.  It was nice to have each others’ uninterrupted attention to debrief on our lives since we had seen each other last.
Scout eats a lot on zero days.  Breakfast was bagels and fruit, lunch was a burger and fries, and Mike generously took us out to a very nice dinner.  There was a lot of snacking in between as well.  On the PCT and CDT when we spent a zero day in town with other hikers, meals were usually spent as a group and could be very chatty as we shared trail stories.  I often had to ask everyone to not ask Scout questions and sometimes to not even talk to him, because then he would chat when he NEEDED to eat! 
What did I do today?  I went shopping for some fresh food for Scout’s upcoming resupplies.  I typed in a trailjournal entry or two.  I sewed a patch onto his pants.  I organized the food for his next few days, two resupplies of two days each, then one day, then four days, but he only spent five minutes figuring out what he’ll take for the next two days, since he’ll see me after that, and he left the rest for later.  A bit frustrating for me, but he was pretty beat.
And I did one more thing - I told him I am proud of him and impressed that he is hiking this gnarly trail.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570846,"I am climbing Mt. Washington and my thoughts turn to a burning moral question: To moon or not to moon?
Frodo drops me off at Pinkham Notch at 6:45.  The weather forecast is ominous.  In the morning, mostly cloudy with rain.  In the afternoon and evening, thunderstorms and more rain.  What’s one of Mt. Washington’s claims to fame?  It’s reputed to have the worst weather in the U.S.  For decades it held the record for highest recorded wind speed: 234 miles per hour.  That speed put an Indianapolis racecar to shame.
I knew the first five miles should be pretty civilized, a moderate ascent, decent trail, and the rain ended up being pretty civilized – it stopped just before the start of the day’s big climb.  Mt. Washington and The Presidentials don’t mess around – over 3000 feet of vertical gain in just over two miles.  And what was with the grumpy northbounders I saw today?  “You’ve really got your work cut out for you.” “This goes on forever.”  I would have settled for “Have a nice day.”

But the topper was the NOBO I met just after having lunch at Madison Hut, as in President Madison.  (Frodo: I’d write “duh…” but I think that’s a bit snarky, even for me.)  I’d covered 8 miles (in 6 hours) and had 5 more to go to reach Mt/ Washington’s summit.  A NOBO hiked up to me and said, “I have to tell you, that’s the worst sustained rock-hopping stretch of the trail so far.”  He was referring to the next 5 miles to the summit.  He HAD to tell me?  Was there some rule?  Did I look so happy after lunch, happy to be on the Presidential Ridge that he HAD TO prick my bubble?  “You have an easy half mile to the Madison Hut,” I replied.

As for the question of the day, do I observe an AT tradition and “moon” the paying passengers on the cog railway that runs to the summit?  I decided to put the question out to an impeccable moral compass.  My divine committee of right and wrong, my panel of three gurus, aged 12, 10, and 8.  The princesses!  Catherine, Sophia, and Jessica will decide.  I wrote their father on my zero day yesterday and here’s what he wrote back: “Later today I will ask the girls to vote on mooning the train.  Of course, that will require explaining mooning.  Ah, parenting does get interesting when you are friends with a thru-hiker!”  
Later I learned that the princesses did not know what mooning was until their mother explained it.  (Sorry, Monica!)  They were unanimous: “Ewww, that’s yucky!”  But since they didn’t have to do it, they voted YES.  
The northbounder was right that the trail was an irregular rock field, but we’d been subjected to worse in Maine.  It slowed me down some, but for the first time the AT didn’t insist on hitting every summit top.  For Adams and Jefferson the trail rounded the mountain a few hundred feet below the summit.  Now there’s a concept.  But as I neared Washington’s summit, the trail pulled in close to the cog railway and I realized that this raised an age-old question: If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there, does it make a sound?  For me the question was, if I drop my pants near a deserted railway (the last train passed by an hour ago), have I mooned anything?  I kept my pants on.  (Frodo:  Phew!  I was hoping it would be a moot question.  Some hikers were arrested for mooning the train a year or two ago!  Imagine how silly that would be for a 65-year-old!)  Here's the cog railway: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It was amazing to reach the top.  There’s a large visitor center, cafeteria, and store.  All closed.  But I could get in the entry and even – luxury – use the flush toilet.  The fog even lifted momentarily.

A mile and a half later and I’m in the Lakes of the Clouds AMC Hut.  I’m in “The Dungeon”, the basement bunkroom where AT thru-hikers may sleep for $10.  It does look and feel like a dungeon.  But I’m indoors and happy.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Finally, a shout-out to a hiker from our PCT Class of ’07.  Sunwalker is now married with three kids.  We were at his wedding in New Zealand several years ago.  He wore a full tux … and his hiking shoes.  (Frodo: I think he had PCT cufflinks, too!)  Sunwalker has been reading my journal to his six year old, Reuben.  He wrote me that Rueben has taken to calling himself “Reuben Scout.”  I consider that high praise.  Here’s Reuben about 18 months ago: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570919,"I wake in the Dungeon.  Dank.  A small peek of light from the teensy window, rusted metal, low ceiling that drips, and bunks with a two-foot clearance.  I can’t sit up.  But outside the thick iron door is hope – no rain.
I have 11 miles to go, mostly downhill, 4000 feet, and not only is it not raining, but the trail tread itself is decent.  For stretches of a hundred yards or more at a time I can lengthen my stride.  Did I tell you that I bent one of my trekking poles yesterday?  I’ll bet at least a quarter of all southbounders have so far, though it happens rarely on the PCT.  I torqued the pole, putting weight on it at an angle beyond what its valiant aluminum heart could take.  It’s usable, but now curved like a dueling scar, or the shooting-star scab on my cheek; one more way the AT has marked me.

“Frodo, the trail has been real nice,” I texted from on high.  She’s picking me up at Crawford Notch trailhead after these 11 miles. Aaauugghh, Scout, don’t you know better by now? It’s the lesson Maine drummed into your head.  It’s the lesson of Mahoosuc Notch – Never underestimate how much time it will take.

I started hiking at 6:00 am.  I won’t take any breaks so maybe I’ll be done at 1:00 or even 12:30.

But it wasn’t raining, the high fog was more clear than not, I was above treeline in the Presidentials, passing Mt. Eisenhower, Mt. Clinton, passing view after view.  
The trail grew more and more irregular as I descended, more rocky, muddy, boggy.  Dreams of sugarplums, dreams of 1:00 evaporated.  But the sun was out.

I had a trail first.  I had downloaded an audiobook on my iPhone, Jack London’s Call of the Wild.  I put on my headphones and 140-pound Buck, the cushy judge’s dog stolen for a life in the Yukon Gold Rush flowed into my ears.  Not bad.  When the rain started in earnest, the descent turned New-Hampshire-steep, 2000 feet in 1.5 miles.  Like Buck I adjusted to the harsh new reality.  Here's a photo looking back up the trail: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And finally at 2:03 I reached highway 302 at Crawford Notch, and Frodo.  She flies back to San Diego but tonight she is mine, or rather I’m hers.

We had a hiker stop by our room at the Attitash Resort.  We hosted Margaret (aka Banshee) for two nights back in 2009 when she hiked the PCT.  Now she’s married and a full-time baker.  I’m not sure which was better, trading stories of the PCT and the days when we hosted 150 a year, not 900, or the fresh baked goods she brought us.  See, it’s not ALL about the food.  I’m going to hike out tomorrow with a turkey sandwich made with thick slices of that crusty sourdough.

Time to work on my food resupply with Frodo.  She’s so good to me.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut, Mt. Washington

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570978,"“Make wise decisions.”  This is the last time I’ll hear that admonition at a trailhead until the end of July.  Frodo is going back home to San Diego today.  I’m climbing out of Crawford Notch back into the Whites.   
I think I’ve died and gone to heaven.  I’m having lunch at the AMC Zealand Falls Hut, having just traversed 8 miles of the most civilized trail since my second day on the AT almost 4 weeks ago.  I am eating a turkey sandwich made on bread baked yesterday by a PCT thru-hiker who stayed with us in 2009.  And I met the most cheerful hikers this morning.

During the civilized climb I was going over the verses I have memorized so far of a risqué song, “The Scotsman.”  [Princesses, ask your mom to define “risqué”.]  And who is coming right at me, heading downhill?  A northbounder wearing a big smile and a kilt.  A dark green and blue tartan kilt.  I had to sing him the first two verses, didn’t I?  If you are real good campers, I’ll put those verses in at the end of the journal entry.  (Frodo: ahem… He’ll have his trusty transcriber put them in, he meant to say.)

Certainly the trail was wet and boggy from yesterday’s deluge (Frodo:  He didn’t tell you, but it rained hard yesterday not just for his last 90 minutes on the trail, but for the rest of the day.), but I could actually stretch out my stride in many places.  Look at these photos:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...     http://www.trailjournals.com/j...Doesn’t it almost look like the High Sierra?

About a half mile before luch I came on Jersey girl and her husband Ron.  They were grinning like Cheshire Cats.  She’s been section-hiking the AT since 2009, they are of my vintage, and he’s been doing support the whole time.  They told me, “Today is special!”  Ron was hiking with a backpack on “For the First Time!”  She said she’s had the trail name “Jersey Girl” for a long time, but that Ron didn’t have a trail name.  As we parted I made a suggestion.  So now his trail name is “At Last”.

The trail was harder in the afternoon, climbing to 4900 feet (I started at 1250 today), but harder only by way of comparison to the morning.  It was civil compared to the riot that was Maine.

After 15 miles, at the Happy Hour time of 6:00 pm, I arrive at the Galeheada Hut, my destination.  Here I am doing a first for me.  I am earning my bed and board.  They call it “work for stay.”  I’ll be washing dishes later.

…Just finished washing dishes with Lioness and Lucky.  Don’t tell the staff here, but I would have paid to have a tub of hot water in which I got to put my hands.  Lucky and I and “CROO” member Carrick sang camp songs as we washed.  Loudly.  Too much fun.  I should work for stay more often.  We got leftovers for dinner, stuffed shells, and after 9:30 we can set up to sleep  on the floor of the Hut’s main building.

Life is good.

I’ll even have time to read Cider House Rules tonight.
From Frodo, the promised verses:
A Scotsman clad in kilts, left the bar one evening fairAnd one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his shareHe staggered on until he could no longer keep his feetThen he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-ohRing di-diddle oh dayHe stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.Well later on two young and lovely girls just happened byAnd one says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye""Oh see yon sleepy Scotsman, so strong and handsome built?"""" I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.""Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-ohRing di-diddle- oh day"" I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.""....... not sure why Scout wanted just the first two verses, there are 3 more.","Crawford Notch

Alarm sounds at 5:30

Hiking at 6:30.

It’s July 3rd and over 100 hikers passed me from the opposite direction.  Over 100!  Big climb up Mt. Lafayette.  
The morning was a long pull.  I had a secluded lunch on Lafayette, the wind whipping like a gale – with at least 50 other people!  All these people out in our country’s great outdoors.  Including an interesting guest.  A bright yellow sailplane buzzed us once,  twice, three times.  I think I shouted for joy each time.  The third time I got a great short video.  I’ll post it on Facebook later and give you the link. Here it is: https://www.facebook.com/barney.s.mann/posts/10155456078296119?comment_id=10155456089796119 

Afternoon brought spectacular views and moderate ups and downs over LaFayette’s little brother peaks.  I hiked with a group of 7, a lucky number, thirty-ish weekenders: Brendan Nick Ryan B Ryan J Matt Jen Kelly.  Great company.  The seven were so much fun that I followed them a quarter-mile off trail to climb Mt. Liberty.  I guess it was fated, since it’s the July 4th “weekend.”  Here they all are at the top of Mt. Liberty: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Between me and Franconia Notch is a 3-mile, 4000-foot descent.  It’s a long haul down.  Down. Down.

I’m picked up by Bookie, an AT 2015 thru-hiker affiliated with The Notch, a hiker hostel just outside of North Woodstock.  She is more than willing to stop in town to pick up milkshakes.  I had her at “milkshakes” even before I said, “my treat.”

I am slackpacking tomorrow, which I look forward to.  I’ll explain it to you then.

I have pizza in my tummy, chores – food resupply (organized by my wonderful Frodo) and laundry, etc. – all done and I really, really want to lay my hands on the guitar they have in the common room.

As I said, hearing my alarm this morning at 5:30 feels like a week ago.","Galehead Hut
",Franconia Notch,"Jul 03, Mon",13.60
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571130,"I woke in a bunk bed, top bunk.  When was the last time you slept in a bunk bed?  There was only one snorer in the bunkroom and he’s not too bad.  5:30 alarm.
I am slackpacking the Kinsmans today, 16 miles.  (Frodo:  The Kinsmans are a set of mountains, I believe.)  So, Scout, what is slackpacking?  Slackpack:

 I am so uncomfortable.  I have to confess.  It is mid-morning the day after the date on this journal entry.  I try to be so religious about writing my journal.  Usually I can’t close my eyes in sleep until I have that day’s journal entry done.  But last night (July 4th) my son Sean said he could meet me for dinner.  (He responded, “Great!  What a lucky dad I am.)  He’d be bringing his climbing buddy.  Then I heard from Dot and Frankenfoot – my trail peeps!  They were pushing to get to a trailhead and Sean could pick them up, too.  Sure we had wonderful town food.  Sure there were random firecrackers going off in North Woodstock near our dining patio.  But I basked in the glow of these wonderful people.  Dot and Franky got buzzed by the sailplane on Mt. Lafayette, too.  “Scout, did you really sleep in the Dungeon?”
Sean and Dave wanted to show me their climbing photos.  5.11b, 5.11c, and 5.12a pitches.  Rumney has the best hard rock climbing east of the Mississippi.  At 10:30 my eyelids were like lead.

I got up early this morning, thinking I’d journal first thing.  But Cuckoo is also here at the hostel.  We chat like excited school kids.  Dear reader, I choose you first over so many things.  But hiking really is about the people.  I feel better already, having ‘fessed up about how I feel.  I think you’ll understand that this time I chose Dot, Franky, Cuckoo, Sean, Dave, and calling Frodo.

(Frodo:  He may have been tardy with today’s entry, but he was prolific.  Too bad I’m such a slow keyboardist.)

… Slackpacking: Carryomg only a daypack’s worth of gear (Frodo: usually food and water, ten essentials bag, rainjacket, not much else) because at the end of that section the rest of your kit will be brought to you, or you will be brought to it.  It’s a common enough practice, but some purists do look down their nose.  I was primed to feel a little sheepish about it.  But I’ve seen strong trail friends treat is as normal course.  Rolling Thunder is more blunt.  “Slackpack? I’m in.”

All of which means I left 60% of my gear at The Notch Hostel and with what feels like only goose down filling my pack, The Notch folks – thanks, Bookie – dropped me off at the trailhead where I was picked up yesterday.  At 5:50, 16 miles and some 4,000 feet up and down later, North and South Kinsman summited, Bookie will pick me up at the next trailhead, Kinsman Notch.  
“Carry your headlamp,” Bookie said.  “It’s a tough section.  A hiker didn’t finish until 9:30 a few days ago.”

I am carrying my ten essentials bag.  My teensy headlamp is inside.  Maybe that’s my excuse.  Maybe it’s Sean’s fault.  I was thinking of him and so much wanting to be on time for dinner.

Remember Margaret/Banshee, the young professional baker and 2009 PCT hiker we had hosted before she started her PCT hike?  She not only brought us baked goods three days ago, she said, “Scout, I’m hiking in to Lonesome Lake Hut with my nephews on the 3rd.  I’ll leave you surprise treats.”

So at mile 2.7, more than 1000 feet climbed, the hut is right next to the trail.  My gosh, I even wrote about Margaret’s surprise on my map!  But head down, thinking of Sean, of 5:50, of not wanting to need my headlamp, I just booked by the hut.  It wasn’t until lunch, 6 miles later, that I remembered.

Dang!  What a doofus!  I felt terrible.  I wished Margaret were here so I could apologize.

I sat talking to a nice northbounder, Malink.  He recited a Scottish nursery rhyme about “Malink” and it had the word “farted”.  And then it hit me.  Has it already occurred to you?

“Malink, can you do me a favor?”  I told him about Margaret’s surprise treats at the hut six miles ahead for him.  (Frodo: Wait a second!  What does “farted” have to do with this??)  “Would you pick up the treats?  Tell them Scout sent you; that I’m a doofus.  Enjoy them.  It will make me and Margaret happy.”

And the favor I wanted?  “Here’s my phone number.  Please take a photo and text it to me.”

True to his word, Malink did.  Here are the photos he sent. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the same shelter where I had lunch, I had word from one of my trail peeps, Cuckoo.  It’s often odd how we communicate out on the trail.  Cuckoo carries a full paperback book with her.  She’s a voracious reader, devouring books like the rest of us do town food.  When she finishes, she leaves the book in one of the lean-to shelters.

Ten days  ago she was swallowing whole Shipping News by Proulx.  I recommended The Time Traveler’s Wife.  The last time I saw her five days ago she’d bought that book and was raving about it.  Cuckoo doesn’t sign the lean-to registers.  But there was a sign of her here at this lean-to, just as sure as if she had written a whole page.  There were two torn-out sections of The Time Traveler’s Wife.  “Cuckoo was here!” I thought.  It was just as if she was sitting there for a moment.

The trail down off Kinsman after lunch was discouraging.  Work those poles hard, plan every step.  No falls!  Slow, slow.  I will not need my headlamp.  I want to be there at 5:50 when Bookie shows.  I want to be showered when Sean shows up.  I never, never want to be “Headlamp Man.”  And then around 4:00 pm the trail gives me a gift.  I haven’t been tracking the trails left to the highway and I came upon a trail sign.  As I approached it, I thought, “Please let it be under 5 miles.  Please have a 4 in front.  The sign said 3.3 miles.  Thank you, trail gods.  Thank you, feet.

I do get to have dinner with Sean and Dave.  Dot and Frankenfoot surface at the trailhead a day’s hike behind me, and we five have a joyful story-laden dinner together.  I do get to call Frodo.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And today (the day after this journal entry), on the top of the last of the big White Mountains, Moosilauke, I got to sit with you all and finish my musings of yesterday.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571295,"I wake in the same top bunk here at The Notch Hostel.  I can feel it in my bones, in the worn soles of my feet: today I tackle the last of the White Mountain giants, Mt. Moosilauke.  After that, I have been promised by so many, “Scout, you’ll see a kinder, gentler Appalachian Trail.”  Personally, I’ll take even slightly less cruel.  Here's the sign at the trailhead this morning: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I am almost joyous during the initial steep climb.  For a nearly 2000-foot rise the trail hugs a thundering cascade, kissing waterfall after waterfall.  I don’t put my earbuds in at any point; my power mix on the iPod shuffle is silent.  No late 60s or early 70s oldies but goodies, no songs from the Les Miserable sound track, no songs from our Temple High Holy Day choir, no Dylan, no Joni Mitchell, no Simon and Garfunkel.  I want to feel this climb, to set up and keep a strong rhythm.  Even to glory in it.

And, my gosh, in the steep sheer granite slabs, they’ve dynamited toeholds or they’ve bolted 6 x 6-inch wood blocks onto the slippery surface.  It takes me three hours.  At the top I break into the open, more than a mile of trail above treeline.  Beautiful scenery day.  I can see back to the Kinsmans, Lafayette, even Mt. Washington.  These massifs that humbled me, made me feel grateful, feel on top of the world.  (Frodo: I imagine it felt really good having those BEHIND you.  Just think how it would feel to the poor northbounder, looking ahead to all the peaks that must be climbed.)

I am gleeful; I am sad.

Mike, my host for tonight – Frodo, Sean, and I stayed in his condo during my zero day in Lincoln, just before I summited Mt. Washington – meets me a half mile on the other side of the peak.  He’s parked at highway 25, the next trailhead.  We walk, chatterbox our way down the south face of Moosilauke.  I am having a shortish day, just shy of ten miles.  I need it after 6 straight days of pushing hard.  Around two miles from his SUV the trail changes.  I hike on real trail tread.  Where are the roots, rocks, stones, and granite slabs?  We hike through a fallow farm field, waist-high flowering grasses and butterflies.  I feel like I walked into Disney’s Song of the South and I’m singing with Uncle remus, “Zippety-Doo-Dah, Zippety-Day.  My, oh my, what a wonderful day!”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I don’t know what the rest of the trail holds.  But the signs are way positive.

Dot, Frankenfoot, and Buck (whom I haven’t seen for three weeks) are invited to stay at Mike’s and Dorian’s condo, too.

We luxuriate in the Jacuzzi.  Wow.

“What kind of ice cream do you want?”  Mike asks each of us and then goes out to pick it up.  So here we are: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Kinsman Notch

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571444,"What a great morning!  Trail angel Mike is in the kitchen when I open my bedroom door at 6:00 am.  Smalls o pancakes and bacon waft in the air. Dot, Franky, Mack, and I sit down to a first breakfast that would even make a rich hobbit like Bilbo Baggins envious. 
Back during the depression hobos, not so different from thru-hikers, would chalk symbols on houses – friendly house, good for a meal, good for a bed.  Mike and Dorian’s was all three and then some.  If I knew the symbol, I’d chalk it on their front door.

We dropped the other three off at their trailhead.  They are two big Whites behind me – Kinsman and Moosilauke.  At the trailhead, just getting ready to start out northbound, was Malinck.  “Scout, you made my day.”  (Remember the trail magic I missed from hiker Margaret the baker, at Lonesome Lake Hut?)  Malinck proceeded to tell me how he’d been having a hard day, but my promise of trail magic 6 miles ahead had perked him right up.  I told Malinck my impressions from the opposite side of the coin.  How I’d been bummed about screwing up, and how knowing he’d get to receive the trail magic had also made my day.  We hugged.  Malinck went off to follow my steps to Maine and Katahdin.  I got back in the car for my ride to a trailhead, from which I would trace his steps through 11 more states to Springer Mountain in Georgia.

“Scout, you should see The Egg Man today.  He’s got a tarp shack set up on Ore Hill.  He makes the world’s best omelets.”

Northbounders generally hit trail magic – someone grilling burgers, a cooler with cold drinks or fresh fruit – at many places in their first several hundred miles of trail.  We’ve had none (other than some cold grapes I lucked into).  The Egg Man would be our first.

I was a picky eater growing up.  It drove my mother bananas, which I loathed.  Also cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, fish, the list went on and on.  To Frodo’s great relief, in my early adulthood I made myself try these, explore my palate like I would a forest.  All these I now like, many a lot.  
But eggs.  Nope.  And when I fed our three kids smashed bananas when they were little, it was an act of love.  So I was excited about seeing the Egg Man and his set-up 8 miles into my day, but no omelet for this boy.

Together with the northbounders who arrived at the same time– No Egg Man – I was disappointed.  But he’d left another treat in his absence.  Two dozen of them for hikers to take – can you guess?  Do you see where this is heading?

Yes.  Two dozen yellow, ripe bananas. (Frodo:  Ha!  I laughed out loud when I read this!)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The first ten miles of trail felt nearly smooth as silk.  Sure, there was a climb and some xxxx, but all that felt in the minority.  (Frodo:  So I was able to talk to Scout and ask what that word is, and he looked on his handwritten journal pages and was stumped.  He told me to just leave it out.  But I said, no, I’m going to make a snarky comment about you not being able to read your own writing. He laughed and told me to do that, because he deserves it. Ha!)

But the miles after that changed from silk to sandpaper.  I had hoped to get further, but I’m stealth camping after 16 miles.

In two days I will be in Hanover, home of Dartmouth where Sean went to college.  I’ll arrive on a nearo day and then take a full zero day.  I have not had a full zero since Pinkham Notch, which will have been 9 days. I need one.

Time for dinner.  But first a big Shout-Out to a Birthday Boy.  He was born in 1924.  My dear father turned 93 today.  Happy Birthday, Dad!  I called him last night – can’t today.

Have you guessed what I’m doing?  Hint: I’m at the peak of the tallest mountain around and I’m quite sober.

I’m up in the abandoned Smarts Mountain Fire Lookout Tower.  Heaven has quite the view, let me tell you.

The fire tower was at my 5 mile mark and I am clicking along, my trekking poles twin metronomes, marking off trail mileage, 6, 7, 8… I’ve tried to bring you right there when the trail hurts like a canker sore, so you deserve to stride with me now and walk this near-cushy, day-spa stretch.  Eleven miles, and it’s not late afternoon trying to push on for 15 or 16, but it’s lunch.  Lunch.  I’m on Holt Ledges, sitting on my own personal ledge.  It was supposed to rain today.  I have such sun on my ledge that I’m wearing my sun hat.  I started the day 27 miles from Hanover.  I let myself daydream – a luxury – as the afternoon plows along.  “Could I power through to Hanover?  I’ll go the Hanover Inn, price be damned!  Twenty-seven miles be damned!”  (Oops.  Princess alert.  Princess alert.  If I say it twice, does that make up for it being after the fact?) (Reuben Scout alert, too.)

I know it’s a daydream, but I indulge it.  “I’ll order room service.  So what if it’s 11:00 pm?”
http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
There are modest ups and downs.  In an open field it starts raining at 7:30.  At 8:00 under a heavy forest canopy, it’s getting dark.  It’s two weeks past the solstice.  I can feel the days are not quite as long.

Five miles before Hanover, 8:30 and with the foot odometer just showing three of a kind, 22.2, I find a stealth camping spot.

I set up the tent and crawl inside.  I blow up my neo air mattress, write in my journal, I just can’t face my cook pot.  My eyelids suddenly feel as heavy as a 50-pound pack.  “I’ll just close them for a moment.”  I force down a 3-oz pack of salted almonds.  I pull out a pack of crackers.  The crackers are still unopened when I wake again at 12:30.

Hanover.  It’s like Dorothy’s Emerald City on the horizon.  I don’t need a wicked witch chanting, “Poppies will put you to sleep.”  I nod off again.

So many memories flood me as I stride along the trail for well under three hours. I am nearing another important spot.  Bill Bryson’s Book A Walk in the Woods begins with him walking past the co-op and the gas station, standing on the edge of the high school playing field.  He looks off in the distance to where a path disappears into tall woods.  It’s the AT.  It’s at the edge of Hanover.  The path leads to Katahdin.

Ten years ago I stood at that exact spot.  It was a week after Frodo and I had finished our PCT thru-hike.  I’d flown to New Hampshire to be present at the dedication of Harris Lodge, a 3600-square-foot hexagonal log cabin, built with student labor, some volunteer, some paid.  Sean was on the paid crew for a season and in charge for a season.  Frodo and I helped for a weekend.  I laid several hundred square feet of wood floor.  (Frodo: The front deck of the lodge was modeled after the front deck Sean built for us, with the same cool herringbone pattern.  Sean got his first construction job before college.  He was spending the summer with my parents up in the mountains, listened for construction sounds, walked up and asked if they could use another worker.  That takes some guts.  Oops; now back to Scout.) 
So back then I was standing at the “Bryson spot,” looking out into the forest, and a couple with a dog walked up to me.  “Are you thinking of doing the Appalachian Trail someday?”  “Maybe.”  “Well, if you do, we’re Andy and Anne Steele and we live in town.  We’d host you when you come through.”  That was 10 years ago.  I am now writing these words from their house.

I came out of the woods at 8:50 am.  I was thinking of being here with Frodo and Sean his freshman year, of ten years ago and meeting the Steeles, of reading Bryson’s beginning, having no inkling I’d ever undertake the AT myself.  Now here I am.  There is one person I really want to share this with, but she’s sound asleep in San Diego.  I hesitate, then I call Frodo.  I am tearing up even now, hours later as I write this.  I am really here.

Frodo goes where we shouldn’t go now.  “I wish you were here with me, cuddling in bed.”

I write these words, but I can’t really think them.  We both backed away from that.  I’m so glad she didn’t mind being woken up.

The Steeles have a lovely home on a lake.  There’s a sunroom where I’m sitting right now.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I walked through a Robert Frost poem this morning.  No, not “Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood.”   But I think I’ll tell you about that tomorrow.  
And there’s news from the Princesses to pass on – They were appalled to learn that I slept in a dungeon, as princesses would be.  That too for the morrow.  Eat, Scout, eat.  Breakfast at Lou's this morning: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Stealth Camp near Etna Road

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571824,"What a wonderful zero day.  But before going there, how about a little culture?  Is poetry culture-y enough for you?  You see the photo and some of you have already recited the famous line.  As I approached Hanover the last two days every few miles, running along in a dark forest, in great disrepair, a great stone wall heads out of sight in both directions.  Who built these?
Robert Frost memorialized them in his poem “Mending Wall”.  “Good fences make good neighbors,” Frost wrote that his neighbor said.  Out here, the walls stood out.  We are in a place where the walls have come down, almost disappeared between each of us.  All these blocks we erect to measure, put each one of us in our place – are we city or country folk, rich or poor, did we go to college or not, all of these fade in the face of our meeting in the outdoors.

Frost wrote, “Something there is that does not like a wall.”  Out here we’ve found we can live fine without them.  That’s why it was so unusual to see this rock wall come out and try to clutch the trail.

Annabelle and Andy could not have been more gracious hosts.  They drove me all over Hanover and nearby Lebanon to find the only store in a 20-mile radius that had a gas canister for my stove.  And when Dot, Franky, and Buck texted, “We are making it to town around six,” Andy and Anne picked up the three, made a special trip to buy fresh corn, etc., for a barbeque, and welcomed them into their home like long-lost cousins.  We cavorted on the lake 200 feet from their house on paddle boards and kayaks.  Anne and Andy actually thanked us all for coming into their lives, while we at the same moment were trying to thank them.
The intrepid paddlers: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... and Dot and Franky, sort of paddleboarding:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Dot and I finally got to play guitar together, passing the instrument to the other as each of us finished a song. We four are sleeping spread out all over the house in soft places.

I head out into Vermont early.  The three of them will take a zero day.

>>>A few bits and pieces. 

– By now the term thru-hiker must be very familiar to you.  But what, pray tell, is a thru truck?  See this sign on a Hanover street. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

T – Finally, let’s end with a word or two from the three Princesses.  The three wrote to me, along with their dad.  The eldest wrote, “In your trail entry about boogers my dad read it each time you wrote it.  At least that’s what he said.”  Dad reported that the three asked, “Why did they make Scout sleep in a dungeon?” Lastly, that they all three think Reuben Scout is adorable.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571886,"What a great day.  I don’t think I could come up with one negative thing to say, even if you twisted my arm behind my back.  Although I guess there are those that might say hiking 17 miles with a pack is a complaint-worthy experience.
Starting in a bed at Andy and Annabelle’s, breakfast of toast, butter, and lingonberry jam, more time with Franky, Dot, and Buck, and then Andy dropped us all off in town.  They are doing a full zero today and I hiked away from the Dartmouth College Commons.  Here’s the face of trail angels: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I didn’t even get emotional when I walked across the New Hampshire – Vermont state line.  It’s not that I am any less sentimental or moved – a second state done! – but there was no sign, no marker.  Deep in the Maine woods there was a sign, but on the wide bridge over the Connecticut River there was no marker.

I hike beautiful trail for 9.5 miles into Vermont.  Such ladylike ups and downs (Frodo: What’s THAT supposed to mean?  Women can’t handle steep trail?? Ah, I’m just giggin’ you!), the path well suited for a country club.  I walk through the tiny townlet of West Hartford and I have a delightful lunch, nay, a picnic, laying out my groundsheet on river-edge grass.  It’s early enough that I even take a 15-minute nap.

As I’m packing up, Moose walks by.  I’d met him once before on a day when he was slackpacking 21 miles northbound from Pinkham Notch to Gorham, and Sean and I were climbing Wildcats A, B, C, D, and E and then precipitously dropping into Pinkham Notch to meet Frodo.

Moose and I strode out of town, matching pace and telling trail stories.  Then it happened for the first time.  “Are you Scout?” from a northbounder.  “There’s trail magic ahead and they’re waiting for you.”  And again, and again, and again.  Who is doing this?  We get details.  “It’s at Cloudland Farm Road.”  “There’s chili, pizza, cornbread.”  “They have watermelon and wine.”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Almost 17 miles from our start in Hanover, we step out onto the dirt road, see the two cars parked, the table, Coleman stove, cooler, and folding chairs.  I am almost immediately hugged.  Or is it a wonderfully-enveloping gang tackle?  Early Bird and Hog met at our house the day before they started the PCT.  Frodo picked them up.  
“It was my first exposure to the generosity of the trail community,” said Early Bird.  They'd been reading my trail journal, figured I’d be here today and had been sending messages up the trail most of the day, like smoke signals.  And they fed 35 others.  Here we are: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
More NOBOs came out of the woods.  Cornbread slathered with butter passes my lips.  Pizza.  Wine.  Wine!  With Early Bird, Hog, and the NOBOs, we are seven.  Moose mentions the AT tattoos.  I give them out.  It depletes my stock.  One gal put hers on her forehead:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...Mandrake put his on his chest.
After two hours, first dinner, more hugs, thanks flowing both ways, Moose and I, too, disappear into the forest.  We stealth camp a mile later.  I eat dinner #2 and now I write to you.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572007,"1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 17, 19.  What am I counting?  Hint: Our first seven days on the International AT it was zero.  In the first weeks on the AT it was 1 or 3 or 0.  Two weeks ago it was 5.  But today it’s 11:00 am and we are one shy of our first 20.
Guessed it?  It’s NOBOs.  
How many northbound AT thru-hikers we passed today.  They are starting to be thick as thieves.  (Frodo: Okay, I really TRY not to correct Scout publicly, but sometimes it’s just too hard.  I’m not sure he thought through his use of that phrase.  In this case, “thick” means “conspiratorial,” not “dense.”  Please forgive me, Scout.) 
I’ve run out of my gold AT tattoos.  I have 50 more in my resupply box this weekend. Then I’m out until I get the 600 I re-ordered.  That’s 20 cents a smile.  They are more fun than a box of cracker jacks.  
The trail continues to be smooth as a baby’s bottom.  After six miles we cross US Route 12 and veer off an easy 0.2 miles to a wonderful mountain store.  Fresh apple turnovers, chocolate milk, and ice cream – my second breakfast!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We cross a stream and, my gosh, there’s trail magic.  Two buckets were left, one full of empties and one empty except for two cans of Mountain Dew.  I have not had a Mountain Dew in years.  Before there were power drinks like Red Bull there was Mountain Dew, a jolt of sugar and caffeine.  As I tilted the bottom skyward, I felt I was  reaching with a finger to stick it in an electric socket.  ZING!

“Scout,” Moose was pointing with the wood hiking pole he’s carried for hundreds of miles.  A turtle!  Can anyone identify it?  Frodo?  (Frodo:  not a clue.  I'm a MOLECULAR biologist, remember?)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  (Frodo again: but it looks like it might be a painted turtle.  Are there red splotches under the edge of the shell? red stripes on the legs? It doesn't look like any of the other Vermont turtles.)
20!  23, 28.  We’ve never passed 20 northbounders in a single day.

We have a late lunch, but we have 12 miles done and are in a spacious cabin, “The Lookout.”  There’s a sleeping loft.  There’s a fireplace.  Why is it called The Lookout?  See the photo. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
On the porch of The Lookout I get to do something important.  I have the slenderest of cell phone service.  “Mom,” I begin.  This is an important day.   On July 11, 1948, an important pact was entered into.  Don and Micky Mann each said, “I do.”  Three years later their first was born.  Me.  “Happy Anniversary!”  My parents have been married 69 years.  I’ve asked my brother and sister for a photo, since we have no recent photos.  (Frodo: a perfect photo from May, from our sister-in-law Jackie) http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   I want to show you where I come from.  Dad still jokes, “I’m still on probation.”  Yes, what a long and wonderful probation it’s been.

“Congratulations!”  We get a puzzled look from the northbounders; you are number 30, 32, 35, 37.  As we near our destination, Stony Brook Shelter, just a hair’s breadth under 20 miles, we hit our 40th NOBO of the day.  With the one at the shelter, that makes 42.  I remember when it was 1 or 3 or none.  How many tomorrow?

I lie here with a full belly – Mountain House Beef Stroganoff for Two, all consumed by only one (Frodo: Scout’s first traditional freeze-dried dinner on the AT).  I feel like I’m channeling someone across distance and time.  It’s Jessica, the littlest of the princesses.  She’s wagging her finger at me and shaking her head.  “Scout, why did you use ‘baby’s bottom’ when you could have used ‘baby’s butt’?  Sorry, Jessica.  (Frodo: Ha!  Jessica phoned me yesterday to ask me to type faster, since they want to read more about your hike.  I had to explain that I’m not the holdup, usually it’s that I haven’t got the entries and photos from you.  But I don’t think she even thought about using ‘butt’!)

We have ten miles to town, to the Yellow Deli Hostel in Rutland.  The one Moose has been awaiting for over a month, the one run by a sect called The Twelve Tribes.  (I can only remember 4 of the 12.  Shame on me.)

Moose and I meet such delightful people on the ten miles in, and if there is such a thing as tame 1000-foot and 500-foot climbs, we had them.

We would have taken only five minutes to filter water, but then NOBO Pockets showed up, chipper, bright-eyed, and as eager to talk to us as we were to her.  And those legs of hers!  Yes, they were shapely, well-muscled, young legs, but that’s not what we noticed – NO BUG BITES!  After 20 minutes, Moose nudged me; we had to move on.  Pockets got one of my last two AT tattoos.

Moose and I had just finished chatting about how we’d like to see more individuals of color out here (we’d run into our first African-American NOBO), when we met four young adult hikers from Queens out on their first dayhike.  Three miles that would end at Thundering Falls.  They were Gozi, Habib, Salim, and Ariz, all Bangladeshi.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We sat down with them and went over their maps, made suggestions for their next day’s hike.  I had the luxury of Boy Scouts.  These four are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps to enter the outdoors.  I hope they come back for more.

The ""pep talk"" on my cough drop wrapper:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
When Moose and I hit the highway, route 4,  we knew we’d have to hitch the six miles to town, or there’s a once-an-hour bus you can flag down.  Had we blown it by all that chatting?  Not even two minutes went by and here came the bus.

We got settled in the Yellow Deli Hostel – yes, there is a deli here, too.  And they are so low-key about their religion.  I eat, eat, eat.  I send photos to Frodo of full plates and empty plates.  I have a cherry turnover right next to me now, it’s 10 pm, that I will eat before my eyes close.  And I know I will cry soon.

First, I am a monster.  Only a monster rips up books.  Since Day 1 I have carried a sheared-off 70 to 100 pages of Cider House Rules.  After 500 miles, I have just a few pages left.  Homer and Candy will soon finish their self-inflicted tragedy.  Homer will answer that question posed by Charles Dickens in the opening lines of David Copperfield: “Will I be the hero of my own life or will someone else be?”

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572244,"It’s raining.  I can hear it from inside the Yellow Deli Hostel where I’m dressing for the trail.  I’m putting on what Frodo calls my “skimpy running shorts.”  The last three days I’ve been carrying my 10-ounce hiking pants in my pack and wearing these 3-ounce nearly-too-revealing nylon running shorts.  I think the last time I wore shorts while backpacking was in 2006.  Why?
Let’s play AT Trail Jeopardy.  “I’ll take apparel for $400.”  The door opens, the clue is “25.”  Buzz.  “What’s the difference between the usual rainy day temperature on the AT versus the PCT and the CDT, in degrees Fahrenheit?”

When the bus from Rutland dropped me off at the side of the highway early today – there’s no bus stop, the city bus just pulls over onto the shoulder – the temperature was over 60°.  On the PCT or CDT the temperature when it rains can easily be in the low 40s or worse.

“I’ll take apparel for $1000.""  “The clue is 5,000 to 10,000.""  Bzzz.  “How much higher are you on the PCT and CDT than on the AT when it rains?”  (Frodo:  Does it really matter if it’s raining?  That doesn’t affect the elevation!)

Today I probably averaged just over 2000 feet in elevation, even including a brief kiss to 4000 feet on the top of Killington.  The low spot for the entire CDT is higher than Killington!  So when it rains on the other two trails I’m often many thousand feet higher.

(Frodo: Okay, it’s just one of those snarky days.  But, ummm, neither of these clues or questions is about APPAREL.)

How’d those shorts work out today?  Just fine.  My legs got wet but they weren’t as bad as wearing wet pants.  Even when I wear my rain pants, if it rains for hours my hiking pants eventually get soaked through.  I’m seriously thinking about not carrying my hiking pants.  (Frodo:  I can just see all the hikers and townspeople you encounter rolling their eyeballs.  Those are really skimpy shorts.  And see today’s Zits comic strip: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... )

We spent six miles climbing Killington.  There was no view from the top.  This is the new norm.  In The Presidentials, in The Whites, you rose above treeline and had views to the horizon.  The last time the trail rose above treeline was at Mt. Moosilauke.  For the rest of the AT we will never rise above treeline. 
There was good trail tread today.  And something new.  Just before we left the AT yesterday for Rutland, we joined up with Vermont’s Long Trail.  It was the first “long trail” in the country, begun in 1910.  The AT joins it for 105 miles. (The Long Trail is 272 miles long.)  This means that today we were not only seeing AT NOBOs, but also Long Trail NOBOs.

500!  Today we passed pur 500-mile point.  We have hiked on the AT for over 500 miles.  I had a late lunch after 10 miles at the Cooper Shelter.  (The sign on the privy said it was the Cooper Pooper.)  Moose and NOBO the SOBO were heading out before me and I said, “Look out for Grey Wolf.”  I hiked parts of the CDT with Grey Wolf, and he also helped us host PCT hikers for three weeks in April 2016.  He’s now hiking the AT NOBO.  Shortly after I started hiking again, “Is that you?!?” I heard.  Grey Wolf got a long hug, but we both had miles yet to hike. 
I’m fading.  After 17 miles, at 7:00 pm I set up a stealth camp.  My eyelids are so… heavy….","Hwy 4, Yellow Deli Hostel in Rutland

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572324,"For weeks it has felt like the trail milestones were for the Northbounders.  “2000” and “1800” written in bold signs or in rocks.  What about us SOBOs? Are we chopped liver?? (Hey, Dan, explain that phrase to the princesses.)  But yesterday we finally earned our due.  “500 miles” said the sign.  (Hmmm… did I write about that yesterday? Welcome to being 65.)
Think of someplace 500 miles away.  You’d likely fly there instead of drive.  Now imagine walking to that place.

I woke in my tent, listening for rain.  The prediction had been for a 90%chance, with thunderstorms.  I packed for rain but was grateful it hadn’t started as I rolled up my dry tent.

The descent of Beacon Hill, where I had camped, was a mini version of the steep Maine descents, and I needed one of my poles to half ward off a fall.  It flexed, then bent.  Dang, my second bent hiking pole.  But better it than me.

I’d really like to do a 20+ mile day today.  Tomorrow I’d like to hit Manchester Center, my next town, for lunch.  That really means 23 today, leaving 10 for tomorrow.

The sky spits and threatens as I stride out on largely great path.  I hit 13 miles by 1:00, have lunch at a deserted shelter – surprising since I’ve seen over 30 hikers before lunch.  I’ve never had 13 miles covered by a 1:00 lunch on the AT before.  It’s not flat – we climb 500 feet, then 1200 feet, but the trail tread is so often mighty fine. 
I thought someone had dropped a plastic toy lizard on the ground.  It was a bright fake red – then it moves.  It’s a red newt: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Near the peak of White Rock Mountain I came across a cool sculpture garden of rockpiles.  Scores of stacked white-colored rock shrines: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
“Scout, I stayed at your house.” I heard that twice today.  First from “Hawaii,” who’s in the rock sculpture photo with me.  She stayed with us in 2014.  Second, the Green Mountain Club Shelter caretaker, Elina.  (Frodo: Sorry if I butchered your name; Scout’s writing is illegible.)  She said almost exactly the same thing.  Except she stayed with us in 2011, a big snow year on the PCT.  And except that she handed me a baggie of seven organic strawberries she’d just hiked in today.  Here we are: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... and here are the strawberries: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
“I was an Eagle Scout,” said Eddie Spaghetti, a northbounder likely in his 50s.  You have to earn your Eagle rank by your 18th birthday, so he made Eagle over three decades ago.  But he was wrong.  “You ARE an Eagle Scout.”  It is always present tense, whether you just had your Court of Honor or you are 80 years old.  All other ranks are past tense.  “I was a Life Scout.”  That’s the rank just below Eagle.  A decent number of the male hikers out here are Eagle Scouts.

Did you know that there are fewer Eagle Scout ranks earned each year than Ph.D.s?  When I learn someone is an Eagle Scout, no matter their age, it’s as meaningful to me as if they were Phi Beta Kappa.  On so many fronts a boy has to exhibit real leadership, run events, and learn skills.  And one of the biggest requirements is an Eagle Project – he has to plan and fully execute a significant community project.  He has to raise the money for the material and expenses, not from his own pockets or his parents’.  Often there are multiple days for which he has to arrange a work party.  And here on the AT was a sign indicating an Eagle Project.  Many, many feet of raised boards over a bog.  Thank you, Eagle Scout Graham Melville!

“Scout, you made it.”  So said Moose when I pulled in to Peru Peak Shelter at 6:30.  Twenty-three miles done.  The rain held off all day.  AT 9:00 pm, a short while ago, it started raining hard.  I am dry in the lean-to shelter.  The pinging on the roof is my lullabye.","Stealth camp beyond Clarendon Shelter

Moose and I awoke, the only hikers in the 6-person Peru Peak Shelter.  In a trail awash with northbound AT and Long Trail hikers, we have a NOBO-free zone.  It rained off an on last night.  My tent is dry, I won’t have to pack it up wet.  I planned on hiking out at 6:30, regardless.  I don’t ignore rain reports, but if I let them rule my trail life I would still be somewhere back in Maine, peeking out timidly from a shelter.

Right off I tackled Peru Peak.  There were ten miles to the road – Vermont 11/30 – where I would hitch 6 miles in to Manchester Center for a nearo and a full zero.

Just under two miles and 1200 feet up over wet trail.  The NOBOs keep volunteering that the rest of Vermont is a mudfest.  I can’t tell if it’s actually going to get any worse, or if it’s just the worst they’ve experienced so far.  And the mud and bogs we had up north make this Vermont stuff pale.

Moose, who left the shelter after me, caught up and we set our feet on cruise control for the next 8 miles to the road.  We rose into the clouds and passed a sign that said, “vista.”  I bet we could see at least 20 feet out from the vista.  Then, like a bruised and battered hero with some fight still left in him, the sun darted into a clearing. 
Why don’t I linger much on describing the actual trail?  There are exceptions, but it’s like a box of green crayons.  Sometimes the foliage barely parts for your feet, more often you have a two- to three-foot corridor, and sometimes the green is only in the canopy of the trees far above and you walk a dirt path with a leaf- or pine needle-covered forest floor.  I like these segments; you feel you are almost underground.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At Bromley Mountain, the top of a ski area, the sun breaks free, Rocky Triumphant.  We have two miles to go.  We start passing “soap people.”  The trailhead must be near, I can smell the odor of hygiene products from 50 feet away.  “Clean” does have a smell.  One of the soap people calls out, “Scout!”

No, it’s not what you think.  She was calling her dog.  Here are the two Scouts, both with bandannas, both mud splattered.  What kind of dog is this?  A Labradoodle? http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Maybe I’ll leave today’s entry at that.

But come on, Scout, how about some details?

Let’s start with Jeff, my host.  The Green Mountain House is a regular house, contemporary and quite nice, decked out with everything a hiker might want, a truly well-equipped kitchen, down to the varied and generous spice rack, a computer, guitar, spacious living room, q-tips, razors, Epsom salts and a bucket to soak your feet in the salts as I did today.  Here's Jeff: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
“Scout, did you know I started this AT hostel because of the PCT?”

Huh?  Did I hear that right?  I started taking notes as I settled into the sofa in my bedroom for three.  (Yes, I said sofa.)  “I stayed with Bob Riess in San Diego in 2006 and he drove me out to start the PCT.  And yes, Bob’s driving was dang scary.  Some say it’s the most scared they ever were for the entire trail.  For Jeff it was only second scariest.

It was a big snow year.  On Fulkler Ridge in the San Jacinntos, 180 miles up the trail he got lost in deep snow above 8,000 feet.  “I thought about John Donovan who got lost in the snow here the year before.  And died.”  Jeff wandered for four hours.  Way scarier that Bob’s driving.  Then he got lucky.  He stumbled upon Trauma, Justin Lichter, who knew where they were and guided Jeff out.  Two years ago, Trauma and his buddy Pepper did the first-ever winter transit of the PCT.  Jeff was lucky indeed.  
Jeff went home.  He couldn’t bring himself to tell his wife.  He was a very experienced hiker and this had spooked him to the core.  When he finally told her, she mulled it over for days, if not weeks.  Her response, he says, was to suggest, “Why don’t you consider operating an AT hostel.  He did and I’m here.

What was she thinking?  Jeff says that she knew the AT hostel season would smack dab overlap the PCT hiking season.  It would forever keep Jeff off Fuller Ridge.

All to the benefit of myself and other AT hikers.

Why’d I run that photo at the top?  Jeff and I had one more thing in common (Frodo: Ummm… you haven’t really told us the first thing you had in common.)  Philmont Scout Ranch, the premier Scouting experience in this country.  That’s the Philmont Bull.  When I say Jeff was experienced, he was a Philmont Ranger in the ‘70s, the elite of backpacking staff. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And Jeff’s a trail angel, too.  When it came time to settle up this evening for a two-night stay ($35 per night, no charge for laundry or the shuttle to the trailhead; a bargain), Jeff surprised me.  As I pulled out my wallet, he said, “So what do you and Frodo say to PCT folks who try to pay you when you host them?”  I told him, “We tell them to put away their wallets.”  Then he looked me in the eye and gave a slight nod of the head.  I was to put my wallet back in my pocket, too.  I’m all the way across the country, he was never in our San Diego home; boy, do I feel warm and cared for.  AGD.

And then this evening, Dot, Franky, and Bucky hit town.  I’d texted them this morning, “I have something I’d like to talk to you about in person.""  It’s been a week to the day since we had dinner together at Andy and Annabelle’s.  Dot said they were guessing, speculating all day.  Was it good?  Bad?  I did surprise them.  Or rather, Frodo and I did, because Frodo was the prime mover.  Dot had guessed a piece of it.  And as I surprised them, I’m going to surprise you.  You’ll see over the next two weeks.

No, Princess Jessica, not even you can force it out of me.  Not even if you threaten me with the dungeon.

But if Reuben Scout asked me real nice.  No, that’s not fair to send in an adorable six year old…

Early tomorrow, back on the trail.  On Wednesday Dot, Franky, and Buck plan to meet we at highway 9 and we’ll start hiking around each other.  LIG (Life is good!)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572625,"I hiked 21.1 miles today and there were two views.  That’s not a typo.  That’s not exaggeration.  There was the lookout tower on Stratton Mountain and a ledge, off trail, at Prospect Rocks.
At Prospect the trail came on to a faint 4-wheel-drive road and you had to know to step off the trail/road and to walk through the woods off the road on faith and then you bust out on a rock with a penthouse view.  So many people miss it that up the road there’s a sign that basically says, “Stupidhead, Prospect Rock is 500 yards behind you.  Go back.”  Check out the sign and see if I am far off: (Frodo: the sign is much less obnoxious than that!) http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
A “green tunnel” has character all its own.  But it means that the trail is largely devoid of landmarks.  On the PCT and CDT I was constantly aware of landscape features a mile or two and 5 or 10 miles away.  Here I see 20 to 50 feet around me.  If I am going up, then in all likelihood I am climbing a mountain.  I’m not complaining, just reporting one way this trail is so different. 
Jeff of Green Mountain House drove me the short distance from town to the trailhead.  I got a 7:20 start on the trail.  I’d re-stocked a limited supply of the AT trail tattoos from my bounce box and one went to NOBO Ghosthiker, whose journal I’ve seen on the trailjournalas.com site.  She’s a retired police officer and as you can see, she has still retained her “pumping iron” form. (Frodo: And she's all match-y! I love it!)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I’m pushing to be in Bennington tomorrow night, 19 more trail miles, where I’m set to meet a fellow hiker from PCT 2007.  Voyageur is thru-hiking the AT northbound and we’re set to rendezvous at the Catamount Motel for dinner.

It’s not often that I hear a new trail term, but over the weekend at Green Mountain House I heard a northbounder us one I hadn’t heard before: “Tramily.”  He was using it as shorthand for his trail family, the three or four he’d been hiking with for a month.

As Dot, Franky, Buck and I made plans to meet up Wednesday at Vermont highway 9 and start hiking around each other instead of seeing each other once a week, I wondered…. Tramily?

And speaking of my tramily from other trails, rumor has it that Guy On A Buffalo may jump on with me in the next few days.  (Princesses, a word of advice.  Do not ask your parents to show you the YouTube Guy on a Buffalo videos again.)

One more Eagle Scout story, from a reader: My son's college orientation included a two-week outward-bound style trip, including a 40-hour solo thing, allowing time for reflection and meditation. During his 40 hours, it rained non-stop and the trip leaders had to go out and bring in the other students after a day or so. When they finally went out to tell my son that time was up, they found him dry and warm, his gear was dry, his food was hot. ""I am an Eagle Scout,"" he told them.

It’s thundering and raining cats and dogs.  I am lying dry in the shelter.  Grateful.","hwy 11/30 and Manchester Center

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572699,"There are talismans that note the change of seasons, the first robin of spring, the first yellow leaf of an aspen or oak, the drooping leaves of tomato plants after the first frost. 
I’ve seen two of them now.  One last Sunday on a northbounder’s pack at Green Mountain House and one yesterday on trail as a northbounder passed by with a nod and no words.  These are the first I’ve seen in over 500 miles on the AT.  Harbingers, good omens indeed.

I saw my first two guitars.  The trail ahead must be good indeed if hikers are confident enough to have a backpacking guitar strapped to their pack.

On the PCT when we hit the Oregon/Washington border we all re-examined everything we carried.  Things like backpacking guitars went to post offices and were shipped home.  I wonder how much further the two I saw will be carried.

I had a front-row seat last night for a feature performance.  There were lightning flashes by the score, thunder that rattled the rough timber of the shelter, and rain that came down in sheets.  I was snug in my sleeping bag, a little mouse staring into the raging storm.

I must have done something good in my youth or childhood (Frodo: Sounds like a song from Sounds of Music!) because Thor and the storm gods were all played out by the time I packed up and started hiking.  Nineteen miles to the road.

I am about as light-skinned as they come and I’ve been hiking for over a week now in these running shorts (I’ll beat Frodo to the punch – “too skimpy” running shorts).  I expose a lot of skin.  But I carry no sunscreen.  Occasional shafts of sunlight are all that make it into the Green Tunnel of the trail.  I haven’t walked through a meadow for days, at least a week.  You know the most regular gaps in the Green Tunnel?  Aside from roads, it’s electric powerline clearings.  I don’t remember when I last wore my sunglasses.  Should I send those off-trail, too?  
Who's been playing in the mud? http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
In the morning, just after the next shelter – Kid Gore Shelter (who was Kid Gore, a wild west hero or a Stephen King villain? (Frodo: Neither.  Harold Martin ""Kid"" Gore was the head coach of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, football team from 1919 to 1927. He compiled a 33–32–5 overall record.) – I climbed Big Rock and got a view, but three miles later, at the Glastonbury Lookout on another tree-covered mountaintop, I didn’t bother to climb the tower.  It was socked in.

Late morning I was listening to tunes on my postage-stamp iPod Shuffle (a one-ounce luxury item, including earbuds). I almost jumped for joy.  The Scotsman song was on again.  First time in well over a week.  Since I started this journey 53 days ago, it’s only the fifth it’s played.  You know what that means?  Each time I have memorized another verse.  It has five verses.  Today I finished the song.  Frodo will include the full text at the end of this entry.  And Princesses, the song has no socially redeeming value (ask your parents to explain that one) except it makes people laugh.  
Today the stars aligned and then if possible they aligned a bit more.  I already planned to come in to Bennington late in the day to make sure I see Voyageur, one of our PCT 2007 cohort who is NOBOing the AT for the second time.  But now in the last 36 hours it turns out Guy On A Buffalo and some of his family are passing through, staying at the same motel on the same night.  (Yes, Princesses, this time I’ll send a picture, but fair warning: he has sheared off those romance-novel-cover long locks.)  Guy had walked 200 yards in to meet me at 4:20 when I finished my 19 miles.  What a dinner we had, with Voyageur, me, GOB, MOG, AOG, and FOAOG.  [Guy On A Buffalo, Mother of Guy (Marilyn), Aunt of Guy (Barb), and Friend of Aunt of Guy (Tina)].  Here's the three hiker types: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I ordered a full second dinner to go, which I soon will heat in the microwave.

Here’s a photo of the calorie count of the milkshake I ordered to go, after having a root beer float with my first dinner. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Now in all its glory. The Scotsman Song:

Well a Scotsman clad in kilt left a bar one evening fair
And one could tell by how we walked that he drunk more than his share
He fumbled round until he could no longer keep his feet
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street
About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by
And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt
They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see
And there behold, for them to see, beneath his Scottish skirt
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth
They marveled for a moment, then one said we must be gone
Let's leave a present for our friend, before we move along
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon, tied into a bow
Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh
Around the bonnie star, the Scots kilt did lift and show
Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards a tree
Behind a bush, he lift his kilt and gawks at what he sees
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.
O lad I don't know where you been but I see you won first prize
Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572778,"I am in a motel bed.  I can and I should sleep in.  I am not going to the trailhead until 11:00 am.  I set an alarm.  For 8:00 am.  So lazy, so civilized.
My eyes snap open at 5:50 am.  I laze there on my side, half in and half out of a soft sheet.  I feel my lower back.  I haven’t told you about the scaly heat rash I’ve had for three days.  It’s right on the hip belt line and on the first day it was angry.  But I’ve borrowed a cotton t-shirt from Guy On A Buffalo and the rash has had a good chanace to air out instead of being squeezed by a hipbelt like a sweaty vise.

I write two emails, then do a truly lazy man’s version of a food resupply out of the gas station convenience store 100 feet away.  Hey, they have top ramen.  (Frodo: We never once ate top ramen on the PCT and I don’t think you ever ate it on the CDT either.  What’s up?)  I buy and eat two breakfasts and a large hot chocolate.  The convenience store has a large shelf with the free local community newspaper.  And, lo and behold, a copy of today’s New York Times.

While I pack my ramen, a quartet of mini sweet rolls, frosted animal crackers, honey roasted almonds and the rest of the gas station store’s best in my food bag, Guy On A Buffalo and his family have set up trail magic at the trailhead – fruit salad, oatmeal and apple cake, scores of _____ (Frodo: Slovak?) cookies that look and taste like dinky ____( Frodo: maybe ruggalah??), chairs, big jugs of iced tea and lemonade.

Guy’s aunt’s friend uses a term I’ve never hear before – “wasband” – to refer to her Johnny Weismuller-handsome ex.  She has knitted 15 mini scarves, 4 inches wide, to give away to hikers to ward off the chill.  What a dear heart.  (Albeit misguided, since we are shedding clothes, cutting off shirt sleeves with tiny Swiss Army knives.)  (I felt Frodo’s frown when I said I might do it.)  I chose out a variegated blue scarf and asked Guy to please mail it to Frodo.  I’ll ask for it back again months hence, in October.

All Guy’s family were primed by me to await three special hikers.  “Watch for Dot, Franky, and Buck.  I promised them treats.”  Guy brought three local beers for them.  When I came out myself at 11:00, I was chewing on a Friendly’s burger and fries and I brought burgers and veggie burgers for the three.  Here’s what trail magic recipients look like: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I hike off with them, for the first time in 300 or 400 miles – maybe since Rolling Thunder?! – I head off from a trailhead with other SOBOs.  The first part is a half mile of stiff Maine-like climb.  Franky and Buck take off, finding a gear Dot and I don’t have.  I get to talk with this delightful young woman for the next few miles …. College, her good friend who is diligently transcribing Dot’s trail journals (look them up – they’re on this same trailjournals site), the book The Power of Now that we both took to heart. The trail unwinds under our feet as if we were singing, as if the words “tedious” and “tough” had never been invented.  At the first shelter, Congdon, 4 miles along, Frank and Buck have waited.

Did you know Buck is short for “Last Buck?”  The name is his trail name, but unlike the rest of us who got ours on a long trail, he got his three decades ago, when his age was single digits.  This tattooed, ex-Marine, ex-champion wrestler softens into warm emotional putty when he talks about being in the YMCA Indian Guides with his dad, how they’d go on campouts, how his Indian Guide name was Lost Buck.  (Frodo: I think they’re now called Adventure Guides.)

I was in Indian Guides with my father.  I still have the vest my mother sewed.  It was the only time he took me camping.  And for ten years I did Indian Guides with our son and Indian Princesses with our two daughters.  I was Red Fox, Sean was Silver Fox, Jordie was Little Fox and Nicky was Rainbow Fox.  What dear times.  Frodo got a weekend to herself while the kids and I made memories. A photo from 1988: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the shelter I startled, surprised, and then all in a rush, someone was calling my name as I was calling hers, a trail name I’d “suggested” more than 500 miles ago.  “Sheriff!” “Scout!”  I thought I’d never see Sheriff again after that fun-filled dinner with her and her “posse” of friends deep in the Hundred-Mile Wilderness.  Here we were, leaner and trail-hardened versions of ourselves.

Dot took off with Franky and I tucked in behind Sheriff, drafting in her wake.  It was so sunny and the trail was great, even if it was muddy.  We have the luxury of time; we’ll get to the shelter early regardless, so we stop and talk to nearly every northbounder we see.  And we talk ourselves, each a storehouse of pent-up trail tales to share, and the tales of our lives, too.

I write these last few pages of this journal entry well after midnight – yes, you can chide me, Frodo.  I deserve it.  My eyelids grow heavy, “I’ll just close them for a moment.”  I wake to nature’s call (just like the Scotsman) and here is my pen, next to these pages, waiting for me to finish.

I’ll turn the headlamp off.  A week from tomorrow I’ll see Frodo.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572825,"Day 55, July 20, Mark Noepel Shelter,16.6, there are no wrong moves, only variations

 

AGD. Another Great Day.  Dot, Franky, and Buck (DF&B) head out a few minutes before I do.  Our goal for the day is the shelter 17 miles away.  Three miles before the shelter we’ll summit Greylock with its iconic 93-foot War Memorial on the peak (and a lodge with a restaurant – food!)  DF&B are on a mission.  In six miles we descend to the road that leads to Williams, the college town.  Dot got new shoes two days ago and they’re killing her.  You rarely read an important long trail fact – your feet often swell a full size or two larger in the first weeks.  She’s doing big Vermont miles wearing instruments of torture.  We discuss operating, cutting flaps for her big and little toes.  But first she’s going in to Williams.  Franky’s pack is dying, it’s way too big, and he’s got a new pack waiting for him in Williams.  Buck wants town food and he doesn’t know it yet, but he will throw away his boots in Williams and buy trail runners like the rest of us.

I headed out with Sheriff.  We made easy work of the six miles down to the road.  I no longer have tattoos to give out (Frodo: there are more on the way!), but for each NOBO the two of us stand on opposite sides of the trail and just before they pass by we raise our trekking poles and cross them over the trail, like crossed swords over a bride and groom, and we cry out, “Southbounder Salute!”  It always gets a smile.

We pass the Vermont/Massachusetts border on the way down.  Our fourth state!  Vermont’s Long Trail begins at that spot and we bid adieu to the Long Trail Tribe.  We’d been seeing them for 105 miles.

Oh my gosh, before I go any further I have to tell you that I saw Bennie the Roadtrek’s first cousin yesterday…  I guess I better unpack that.  (Princesses, you know and love Bennie.)  Back on the PCT, Frodo and I would fantasize on inclement days, “Maybe at the next road crossing there will be a camper and they’ll have hot chocolate on the stove and a head will pop out as we trudge by and say, ‘Why don’t you come in?’”  On the CDT we borrowed a 19-foot mini-motor-home van, a Roadtrek, from our dear hiker friend Tammy.  And Frodo – thank you, thank you, put 14,000 miles on it doing trail support for me and other grateful CDT hikers.  14,000 miles!

The Roadtrek’s trail name was Bennie.  Yesterday, a quarter mile from the shelter, we were met by a trail angel with Mountain Dew cans and candy.  He is driving support for a NOBO AT hiker, and what did I see behind him?  Bennie’s younger first cousin, a Roadtrek 190.  I know ‘most every inch of one.  On those nights I slept with Frodo on the table converted into a bed, “Right here, Sheriff, I’d swing open the big back door and I’d pee standing on the back bumper.”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
But back to today.  Sheriff and I chatted our way up Greylock’s big climb, got a great view of Williams College and its environs.  And we knew we’d make lunch at the restaurant – closes at 4:30 – with 90 minutes to spare. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I had a BLT with double B, I had a coke, and orange juice and an apple juice.  I also had a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both plates came with coleslaw and potato salad.  I texted Frodo photos of the full plate and then the empty plate.  If she could, I know she’d paste a gold star on my forehead. 
We got to the shelter not long after 6:00.  It’s big, 4 double-wide bunks, a loft nabbed by Dot and Franky, and it has an expansive wood floor.  I have had a trail dream for months.  This might just be the place to make that dream come true.  A wide floor, a DANCE floor.  I’m in a line dance class with Frodo at our local YMCA.  All women.  No guy has ever survived more than one class…  UNTIL ME.

My dream was to teach a dance to hikers, somewhere on the AT, and record our own dance video.  Franky recorded, Dot, Buck, and Sheriff picked up the moves.  They lay down in bunks, I put a map in front of my face, and then Franky pressed “play.”  On came “Easy Money.”  I leapt to my feet.  “Five, six, seven, eight.  Walk, walk, one-two-three…”  I called the moves, they leapt out of the bunks behind me.  Cappie, our line dance instructor, says, “There are no wrong moves; there are only variations.”  Boy, we pushed the envelope on that one.  We threw in the Twist, the Swim, the Monkey, and Buck was doing something with his butt with no name.  Dot has posted the video and it’s on my Facebook page.  But don’t have any food in your mouth when you watch it.  Here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9wipIMWZKA

The link is to Dot’s great YouTube site where she records short trail videos.  You should check out the rest: https://www.youtube.com/user/BriaMcCall/videos

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572918,"AGD.  But before the details, I have to backtrack first, oh my gosh, to last night and “The Scotsman” song.  These things don’t happen in real life, but they happen out here.
“Buck, Franky, how about a lullabye?”  That’s what I said to introduce “The Scotsman.”  I told them they needed to give a rhythmic clap background and join in the chorus.  Dot and Sheriff and the other two had already tucked themselves in, snug in their sleeping bags.  You readers have seen the lyrics.  As I started singing the song, suddenly from 30 feet away, from a backpacking hammock, in a strong tenor voice, a northbounder had joined in!  He knew all the words!  His voice was so strong, I’d go intentionally silent for a line and he’d boom it out.  Dot and all busted up, clapping in time, and this guy “Trek” is singing from out of the dark.  Too, too much fun.

Crack, shatter.  Greylock had its SOBO hiker casualty.  At it’s terminal, Franky’s (Frodo: actually Scout wrote “Frandy’s” – ha!) iPhone had met granite and if the game was rock, paper, scissors, and iPhone, the iPhone lost.  
Backtracking again: Yesterday morning at a shelter we met Sean and Joey.  They need to be mentioned.  They are hiking one leg of a Green Beret Relay of the AT.  Sean, if I recall correctly, served 25 years in the green berets.  “Thank you both for your service.”  They carry two flags that they will pass on.  Sean said no one had ever asked to see their flags and take their photo with them: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Today’s hiking was great  Franky and Buck zoomed out while it was still dark.  They had off-trail errands to do that required renting a car.  Dot, Sheriff, and I got off a bit after 7:00 am and hiked the 5 miles to Cheshire, where the Shell station housed a Dunkin Donuts.  Two more breakfasts for me, but sorry, Princesses, no ice cream was involved.

Sheriff had to peel off, spurting ahead the 9 miles into Dalton to make it there before the post office closed.  I must say, the morning with those two was extremely pleasant.  They’d each had horses when they were quite young, each competed at a pretty high level.  I so enjoyed listening to the two of them and adding the occasional story.

Dot and I walked directly into the heart of Dalton.  Dot was our angel, arranging for the four of us to stay at the lovely, welcoming and soon pizza-filled home of Dave, Margaretmary, Hannah, Holly, and a sleeping daughter I never saw.  Here’s a photo of angels: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Mark Noepel Shelter
","Dalton, MA","Jul 21, Fri",13.90
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572995,"I was so torn and couldn’t choose which title to us today, so I chose both.
“10, 9, 8,…” Did you watch the space shuttle launches?  “7, 6, 5…” Or are you like me and did you watch the Apollo, the Gemini and, yes, the Mercury launches?  We’d be glued to the black-and-white tv set staring at this slender rod pointing skyward at Cape Canaveral.  Often there would be an intentional hold in the countdown.  Time passed, but stood still.  
I have been in an ‘intentional hold” since I last parted with Frodo almost 20 days ago.  That’s far too long to do a countdown.  To live out here, to be present, I can’t let myself miss her so.  But this morning, at Dot’s friend’s house, I loudly announced, “Six!”  Six days left till I see Frodo in Kent, Connecticut.  The intentional hold is over.  Let the countdown begin.

We’re doing 19 miles today, starting when Dot’s friend Holly drops us off in downtown Dalton to pick up where we left off, to Upper Goose Pond Cabin which Buck especially can’t stop talking about and anticipating.  “They make you pancakes.  Blueberry pancakes.  There are canoes.  Sometimes the caretaker makes you dinner.”  AT mile 10 there’s the “cookie lady” 100 yards off the trail.  And other surprises await me.  But I am no longer surprised by the nice trail.  Look at this: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And speaking of surprises, I received a punch below the belt today.  It’s so not fair.  I was going to tell you all the surprise for Dot, Franky, and Buck.  In good time.  In a few days.  But then I was emailed this video:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Here’s the secret.  Dot and Franky have never been to New York City.  None of the three of them have ever seen a Broadway show.  Frodo has purchased five tickets for Tony Award-winning “Come From Away” and we have arranged to all stay in a friend’s house outside NYC.  Reuben Scout, everyone else thanks you for squeezing that out of me.

New York City is 120 trail miles ahead, but let’s get back to today… We climbed a nubbin that they rightfully call a hill, and at the top I found Dot and Franky picking at a bush.  “Wild blueberries!”  I’d never have known.  We picked at least a cup-and-a-half and each ate another handful.  We put them in a baggie to bring to the shelter for the promised blueberry pancakes.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At nearly ten miles we came to a road and headed 100 yards east.  “The Cookie Lady” is in the guidebook.  I had no idea it was also a u-pick blueberry farm, too.  So we picked three pounds more.  These are the biggest, sweetest blueberries I’ve ever tasted.  I should say we paid for three pounds.  There’s no telling how many blueberries were intercepted by our mouths on the way to the bucket.  Are we all going to get the runs?

In the late afternoon, 3 miles from the Shelter, two dayhikers approached us.  “A-Train!”  It’s trail magic.  We hiked with A-Trail for some of the PCT in 2007.  He knew where I’d be from watching our Hiker Line Dancing video on Facebook.  He’d plied Sheriff, as well as Buck and Franky with goodies, and now Dot and me.  Dot heard plenty of PCT 2007 stories, along with drinks, snacks, and apples.  Whoo Hoo!  
And I did jump in the lake as soon as I got to Goose Pond Shelter.  But it’s late now, so I’ll tell you about it tomorrow.","Mark Noepel Shelter

9:00 am.  We had decided on a lazy morning.  Blueberry pancakes will do that to you.  Buck was so intoxicated by them that he’s staying the whole day.  We hiked out at 9:00am; Buck will hike out tomorrow and push to join up with us in a few days.  
Franky went for one more swim, sans clothes, which was fine because it was only him and Dot until the kayak launchers trooped down and put in their boats on either side of him.  Close by his side.

I told it like it was when the going was tough in Maine and New Hampshire.  So I guess I have to post this photo of Buck in a rocking chair on the porch of the Upper Goose Pond Shelter:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And also post this of one of the half dozen platters of blueberry pancakes that issued from the kitchen.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Now don’t get me wrong; we hiked 16 miles today.  That’s nearly 13,000 steps.  But I do have to tell you about the watermelon in the trailside cooler at 5 miles: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I have to tell you about the adorable Trail Snack Shack.  Sodas for a dollar.  All on the honor system.  A pouch with the money sat out in the open for us to pay.  It was at mile 8.  I had two root beers to go with my lunch.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And before I go on about more trail magic, I have to tell you about the hardback book one woman was carrying in her pack.  The title is The World is Your Litter Box.  The opening line is, “God’s only mistakes are dogs and not giving cats opposable thumbs.”

Sheriff and I hiked much of the day together.  We know our schedules pull us apart tomorrow.  Dot had declared today as “Hike with Dot Day,” and who she meant was Franky.

We had rolling low hills and climbs more inclined to switchbacks than straight-up ascents.  The otherwise warm day was at least 15 degrees cooler under the green canopy.

We got to the South Wilcox Shelter before 6:00 pm.  It was the four of us until we were joined by Scrunchie, another Southbounder.  I hadn’t seen her since before Hanover.

As we were all catching up, a woman with a pack steps around the side of the shelter.  It must be another northbounder.  We’d seen at least 20 today.

“Are any of you Scout?”  Again?  Wonderful!  What do you say to someone who has hiked in 20 cheeseburgers?  It was Pepper; she knew of what Frodo and I do in San Diego and she’d filled her pack with cheeseburgers and snickers.  She’d  hiked from her car to a different shelter 2 miles away and then hiked it over here.  

I’d almost finished my dinner, a Knorr rice dish with broccoli.  Two cheeseburgers quickly followed.  Here’s Pepper and Franky with four cheeseburgers and a Mcdonald’s bag:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Thanks, Pepper.  And thanks to Bookie at the Notch Hostel in Lincoln for pointing Pepper toward us.

Tomorrow we have 12 miles to Route 7 where we will hitch into Sheffield, MA, to resupply and spend the night.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573174,"The reviews are in.  For two weeks now I’ve done my little dance on the Appalachian Trail catwalk.  Practicality: 9.  Just this morning I hiked the 11 miles to get to Sheffield in the rain.  My long pants, inevitably sodden from the knees down, are history.  My rain pants stay in my pack.  I hike in my _____ running shorts. 
Though very practical, on the “fetching” side of the equation, many folks off trail have made their opinions known.  Frodo has purchased not one, but three pairs of shorts to bring as options to replace the pair I am wearing.  (Frodo: Actually FOUR.) The father of the Princesses just ended an email to me with: “On another note, may I buy you some shorts?  Those are …. Something.”  My brother-in-law Rick wrote in my trailjournal guestbook:  I have shorts like that... Trisha calls them my ""booty shorts.""  I guess the lack of comment from my fellow trail peeps is … them being polite.   Does anyone else want to weigh in?  Anyone else want to pile on?

As we packed up to go this morning, listening to the rain ping on the shelter roof, I didn’t even need to say it myself.  I forget whether it was Dot or Sheriff, but one of the two said loudly, “FOUR.”  Four days left till I see Frodo.

I hiked through the rain with Sheriff and Scrunchie.  The three of us played two different trail games.  First, one of us named a geographic location, say “Albany,” and then the next would have to use the last letter as the first letter for the next geographic location.  “Estonia”, “Arkansas”, etc.  Miles 6, 7 and 8 rolled by.

Next, we all worked together to see how many songs we could name that had the word “rain.”  You had to at least be able to sing a few lines, including the line with the word rain in it.  How many can you come up with?  Miles, 9, 10, and 11 and we hit route 7 and we are on the outskirts of Sheffield.  Twenty-four songs.  (Frodo:  I’m impressed!)

Along with Dot, Franky, and Sheriff, I am safely ensconced in the home of Jess Treat.  Sure she charges a hostel rate, but I have my own private room, and it feels more like we’re visiting the home of a beloved aunt.

I got in at 1:00.  Had two full lunches and now am doing town chores and reaching out to loved ones.  (Which is what it feels like to me as I write this journal.)","South Wilcox Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573471,"*-THREE-* Do I need to say more?  
The centerpiece of breakfast at the hostel today was eggs and toast. You may recall my feelings about eggs from the day of the Egg Man.  I love quiche, but I have to engage in the fiction that there are no eggs in quiche.  So I had 5 slices of toasted raisin bread, all lavishly buttered.
We didn’t get back to the trailhead and start walking until 8:00 am.  Sheriff and Dot were going to hike together, as were Franky and I.  For Massachusetts we had a big climb and it started up raining.  But it was really the first time it had been only Franky and me, and we pulled each other up and over the top, reaching to a shelter 8 miles along for lunch.

We ran into the usual-for-now complement of northbounders.  But more often than not they seemed wet and far from high on life and hiking.  This is a change.  But maybe being 1500 miles along with 700 still to go is more disheartening than for those NOBOs of weeks ago who had 2000 miles done and 180 to go.

Twice on the trail today I ran into folks I know.  In the morning it was Joshua “Bobcat” Stacy and his friend Juncko: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And in the afternoon it was Bill Jensen and his crew.  Bill hiked the PCT in 1977: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
In the afternoon it began to clear. Halleluyah.  On the next mountaintop I caught Franky on a high ledge amid the clearing clouds. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
STATE LINE – around 5:00 pm, 15 miles done, we crossed from Massachusetts into Connecticutt.  I guess I will now have to learn to spell Connecticutt.  (Frodo: Connecticut)

We are in a small shelter, six of us lined up side by side like sardines.  Buck is two away and  lightly snoring.  Franky is right next to me.  He’s lightly snoring, too. That dainty wheezing from Dot certainly can't be snoring, can it? As I wind up this last line they all just started snoring in time.

We have a great easterly view from the mouth of the shelter.  Are of us are hoping for a glorious sunrise in the morning.

Let’s say you are Bill Gates’ Executive Assistant and Bill says “Design me a wilderness sunrise experience.  Spare no expense.”

So you design a rustic log shelter, snug, waterproof, open on one side that faces directly east, enough room for Bill and five of his billionaire buddies.  Place it high on a densely wooded mountain with enough trees cleared for an open view to the east, but enough left to frame the sunrise like a painting.  Pray for good weather and tell Bill to set his alarm for 4:30 am so he can enjoy the whole show.

OR you could be the six of us southbounders at the Riga Shelter this morning.  Silent, rapt, watching the sky change from deep gray to burnt orange to pinks and brilliant reds all over a valley filled with moving fog.  Dot nodded off and on.  Buck was restless, moving out of the shelter and back in again.  The show lasted over an hour: Here are Buck and Sheriff enraptured with the view:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At mile 3 we walked into Salisbury, where we had second breakfasts.  I’d never heard of a French toast croissant but it was amazing.  And combined with a cinnamon roll, hot chocolate, and whipped cream should make Frodo happy with me.  I won’t quite be Chubby Hubby like the Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, but hopefully there’ll be enough meat on these well-used bones.

At 1:00 pm with 10 miles showing on the foot odometer.  I was out in front and stopped at the base of the 80-foot-high Housatonic Falls.  A perfect spot for lunch, river side, smooth rock, both sun and shade, with the roar and sights of the waterfall nearby.  It had been largely “Hike with your own self” Day, but Dot and Sheriff got into a talk about cuddling – no, it wasn’t me who initiated it, even with Frodo due tomorrow.  On “spooning,” one of them said, “Sometimes I like to be big spoon to his little spoon.”  Here's our lunch spot:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I had some great trail conversations today.  I passed two day hikers out for a series of hikes, Evelyn and Maggie, both schoolteachers.  Earlier in the day I’d been singing songs from West Side Story to myself and next thing I know I’m speaking to two Puerto Ricans:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Less than 24 hours till I see Frodo tomorrow night in Kent, Connecticut!

At dinnertime I cooked up the four ounces of sirloin tip pieces I’d bought in Salisbury, sautéing them in olive oil and then adding them to my Knorr rice dish.  How can it be better than that?

Meanwhile, out in the real world, the “shorts” debate rages on.  What was once a one-sided discussion has suddenly taken a turn toward “Let him wear them!”  Families have been torn asunder.  The father of the Princesses (who said in an email, “The shorts, well, I know you like them. It's just that your dear wife might be accurate on this one...”) sits at the dinner table, with the three Princesses firmly on the side of the skimpy shorts and even his wife has taken her stand (“And Monica says that you should wear whatever you want and everyone else (me) should keep their opinions to themselves unless they are going to go hike the AT.”)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573716,"(Make sure you see both entries dated July 26!)Christmas?  But, Scout, you’re Jewish. I woke at 3:00 am, made a short hike to go pee and when I came back to my tent my eyes wouldn’t close.  It was like the night before my first Dodgers game when I was nine.  I am so excited for tomorrow to come.  It’s like the night before Christmas.
Frodo is coming tomorrow.  Before we all went to bed last night, Sheriff said, “Scout, it’s one more sleep.""    
She was right.  Except now it’s 3:15 am and I can’t sleep. I remember two more things I want Frodo to bring.  I text her.  I thought I knew what the texted reply would be – “What are you doing up after 3:00 am?!?”  Instead it was, “May I call you?”  At Pine Swamp Shelter I have two bars, but my tent is cheek-to-jowl with five others.  “I can put on my earbuds, but I can really just listen.”

I am in my sleeping bag and I hear her voice.  I’ll hear it for real in less than 19 hours.

But on the phone we two are also somber with some extremely sad news.  I am processing it still and will probably devote a separate trailjournal entry to it….

(Frodo: I’m not sure when Scout will have time to do that, and you don’t need to be wondering until then.  So I’ll tell you.  A hiker we hosted for three nights in May, who started her PCT hike on our last time driving to the monument, was found dead in a swollen Sierra stream.  She was a very young Japanese woman, petite and delightful, full of life.  Her English wasn’t great, but she was so chipper and so helpful we made a real connection.  I cried off and on all day Wednesday.  So tragic!)

I am up at 5:30 am and Cuckoo is already up and nearly packed.  It’s so good to spend time with her again.  After 3 weeks she’s just devoured the paperback The Handmaid’s Tale and it sits outside my tent where she left it for me.  I hope she’ll avail herself of Frodo’s slackpack and support efforts on Friday.  I’d love for them to meet.

At 6:25 I am hiking out of camp.  DF&B soon follow, and Sheriff, too.  17 miles today.  A few climbs, including one for three-quarters of a mile that looks Maine steep from the topo map and elevation profile.  And there’s a five-mile flat meander alongside the Housatonic River.

Rain threatens, but never does more than a few spitwads. 
I’ve written before about the odd ways we communicate out here.  Here’s one found on the trail that put a smile on all our faces:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Sheriff was way disappointed yesterday when we stopped in a small town for a second breakfast and the bakery that had advertised, “gluten-free cupcakes” had none.  I think I’ve arranged for Frodo to bring two for when we slackpack tomorrow.

We all have to take care of each other out here.  If we don’t help put smiles on each other’s faces, who will?  Sometimes it’s a scratched smiley face on the trail and sometimes it’s a cupcake.

Sometimes it’s someone who stayed at our house twice prior to PCT section hikes, who picked us (DF&B and me) up after 17 miles, took us to her home in Kent, Connecticut, welcomed us, fed us, and gave us a warm bed for tonight.  Thank you, Elaine and Ann!

Just so you understand the logistics, Sheriff and Cuckoo are at a shelter a short distance from highway 314.  When they hike tomorrow, I hope they will run into Frodo at the first road crossing and get to partake of snacks, drinks, lunch, and slackpacking.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573891,"Frodo: Sorry about how behind I’ve gotten on posting journal entries.  I write this on Wednesday, August 2nd.  And now I have to ‘fess up.  Scout usually emails me photos of his journal pages and I transcribe from those.  But since I was actually WITH him, he handed me the pages for this day, our first full day together this time.  AND I LOST THEM.  I assumed they would show up when I unpacked my luggage last night, but no joy.  Tomorrow’s entry has been written already by me, so that Scout can have an occasional day off from journal writing, and now you’ll have to put up with me writing this day’s entry as well.  Sorry about that.  I know, Scout’s the storyteller, not me.
Scout and I had a wonderful reunion when I arrived at Elaine’s house at 10:30 last night.  We had so much to tell each other, it was difficult to stop talking and just go to sleep.  Well, not JUST go to sleep, but we won’t go there.

Then this morning, it was up and at ‘em.  I met Buck and renewed my acquaintance with Dot and Franky, who I had dinner with back in Rangeley, Maine, several weeks ago.  We had bagels and delicious homemade banana bread for breakfast, packed up efficiently, and I dropped them all off about 7:50 for their 17.4-mile day.  They were carrying very little and the trunk of my rental car was crammed with their gear.  I planned to meet them at mile 7 with fresh bakery goods, fruit, juices and chocolate milk.

But first I needed to drive to the Ten-Mile River train station to meet Aaron.  He’s the significant other of our niece Eliana and they live in Manhattan.  Aaron had the day off and he wanted to see what this long-distance hiking is all about.  I had kind of hoped Scout and DF&B would want to sleep in a bit so Aaron could join them from the start, but that didn’t happen.  Aaron didn’t want to wait to join them at the 7-mile point, so we set off to see if we could intercept the hikers.  The trail parallels a road along the Housatonic River and we drove along, hoping to find a side trail that would get Aaron to the AT.  But between the road and the AT were either cliffs or steep densely-wooded slopes.  Eventually, though, the AT actually came down to the road.  Since we had driven about 3.5 miles, I assumed it was about the halfway point if the 7-mile section.  Stupid!  Of course, the trail winds and wanders, so it turns out we parked the car fairly near our planned meet-up point.  I hiked with Aaron north on the trail and it took me a while to realize why we didn’t soon meet up with Scout and DF&B.  But after about 1.5 miles of uphill we ran in to Sheriff and Cuckoo, talking with NOBO Toboggan.  I passed Aaron off to Toboggan and hiked back to the car with Sheriff and Cuckoo, having a lovely chat along the way.  Though I felt like a doofus, it was meant to work out this way.  Aaron, who is quite gregarious, got to hike a bit with me, then a bit with Toboggan, then turned around and hiked with Scout and DF&B, adding a little variety to his morning.  And I got to hike with him and then get to know Sheriff and Cuckoo a bit.  Very nice.  Here are Aaron and Scout: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I hurried off to buy food and drinks and rushed back to where everyone was waiting for me by Bulls Bridge.  We had our “second breakfast” picnic at a very cool overlook, just above where Ten-Mile River tumbles down to join the Housatonic River.  This is a special spot for the father of the princesses, who grew up in the area.  I can see why; it's very stirring.  Aaron had brought a 6-pack sampler of gluten-free mini cupcakes for Sheriff, at Scout's request, and I brought a nice bakery macaroon, so Sheriff felt pretty special: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I met them again 3.5 miles later, with Subway sandwiches, fruit, and drinks.  Here are two of us eating lunch:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It was a day of congenial and convivial hiking, with a fairly large group of 7.  Aaron evidently did great, which is not something you take for granted.  Most folks can’t just jump on the fast-moving determined train of thru-hikers and keep up for long.  He discussed music theory with Dot and I think I heard they also practiced their French a bit.  Here's Scout cooling off: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Scout bemoaned the fact that we hadn’t broken out the new AT gold tattoos from the ginormous suitcase buried in the car’s trunk, since they had crossed paths with several NOBOs and he only had a few left.  This group seems to be the Vanguard of SOBOs.  There are probably a couple others ahead of them, but not many.  One NOBO put it on his neck: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the end of their 17.4 mile day, Scout, DF&B, and I dropped Aaron off at a train station and then drove south.  Once in Scarsdale and ensconced in the home of some hiker friends, we had pizza for dinner and called it a day.
Again, sorry you didn't get to read Scout's prose about the day.  If he wants to add anything to this day, I'll make a note to that effect in an upcoming entry.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573982,"Frodo here, giving Scout the day off with respect to journal writing.  Hope you don’t mind.
It is wonderful to be here with my husband and feel that I can be a part of his hiking experience.  We thru-hiked the PCT together and that was amazing.  But at the time I said that would be my one thru-hike; it met a need in me, but I don’t have that need any longer.  The fact that my feet have never fully recovered pretty much clinched it.  I still love hiking and backpacking, but I’m fine with trips of a week or two.  Scout, however, caught the bug.  Once we finished the PCT he started talking about the CDT and earning the triple crown.  
I knew he really wanted it, but needed a bit of a nudge to actually carve out the time, so I eventually started telling people he would hike the CDT in 2015.  Being a scientist and from a family of engineers, I enjoyed doing much of the planning for that and was able to hike some sections with him and provide support with a borrowed Roadtrek.  (Thanks again, Tammy!)  So I was out there the whole five months, too.  One of the young men he hiked with a fair amount referred to me as their “fifth man,” like on a basketball team, and I liked that analogy.

When Scout finished the CDT he still had the bug, so I started telling people he would hike the AT in 2017.  I mean, the guy is 65, for goodness sake.  You can’t put these things off if you really want to get them done.  The AT doesn’t require a lot of advance planning, so Scout is kind of wingin’ it.  Except he spends a chunk of time each zero day mapping out where he will camp and resupply, etc., until his next zero day.  And we’re sort of playing it by ear as to how often I come join him.  We’re really not used to being apart for weeks at a time, so it’s been a bit hard.  This last 25-day stretch was a bit tough.  But it makes the reunion all the sweeter.

Back to normal journal stuff:  Today was a day to get some things done, but mostly it was a day to relax and enjoy the delightful downtown Scarsdale area.  We are here with Dot, Franky, and Buck, staying in the home of some hiker friends who are currently doing a section hike on the PCT.  They have been very hospitable in absentia, and it has worked out very well for us to be here.  Thanks, Nick, Sheryl, and family!

Scout and “The Boys” (as Scout calls them) decided it was time to get trimmed up, so they went to an old-fashioned barber shop.  The Boys got their hair and beards trimmed, and Scout had his first-ever hot shave from a barber, as well as a touch of hair trimming and eyebrow trimming.  I noticed, however, that he still has a couple ear hairs that need some attention!

They all looked pretty sharp afterward.  But then, they really didn't look too bad before - see the lead photo.  They took that ""before"" photo but neglected to take an ""after"" photo.  Sorry.  And here’s a couple photos of Scout getting his hot shave:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I went to the post office this morning to pick up Scout’s bounce box.  He had had the foresight to put both our names on it, since you need to show ID to pick up a General Delivery package.  I discovered that some post offices don’t “do” General Delivery, including Scarsdale.  We were lucky, though, as Scout’s box was still among boxes waiting to be delivered to home addresses.

Across from the post office in a small park a family-oriented festival was going on.  A musical group was leading kid songs and there were Scout and The Boys, joining right in!  Very nice community event.

A lot of the day focused on eating, eating, eating.  Bagels, sweet rolls, and fruit for breakfast, bagel sandwiches and salads and chips for lunch, fajitas and Spanish rice for dinner.  Our absent friends said to feel free to use the kitchen and I took them at their word.

Today will be wonderful and strange; it will be a polar disconnect from the trail.  We’re dressed for the part.  If Times Square had to employ extras to fill their teeming throng, we would be ready to audition.  Here’s a photo of all of us:

Dot’s looking sharp in a red dress off Frodo’s rack and we guys are all wearing cloths Frodo pulled out of my closet and brought along.  We’re also showing off our new haircuts.  Still, why does it feel to me a bit like the barbarians are invading New York City?  Maybe this photo provides a clue:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We weren’t thrown off the train and at Times Square, amid the spectacle of the Naked Cowboy and dressed-up cartoon characters, we didn’t stand out at all.  But as we took our seats in the venerable Schoenfeld Theatre on Broadway, we were quickly found out. Bob and Wendy’s look said, “You’re not from New York.”  We were there to see “Come From Away,” a Tony award-winning musical.  It’s about the 35v planes and 7000 people that descended on Gander, Newfoundland, when U.S. airspace was closed on September 11, 2001.  We had good seats, but one of us was two seats away from the other four – New York couple Bob and Wendy separated us. 
“Where are you from?” Bob asked.  Then he and Wendy stood and moved one seat over to let Buck sit with us.  “Tell the folks in San Diego that New Yorkers don’t deserve their reputation.”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
On 9/11 Bob was on the air flying to New York.  His plane landed in Denver.  The threesome seated behind us lived in Gander in 2001 when 7,000 tired, scared, far-from-home passengers suddenly needed to be provided for four days.  I was dabbing my eyes for half the show and laughing out loud for the other half.  An African-American passenger repeatedly could not get through to her son.  He was a New York City fireman on 9/11, but he was off duty that day.  But he stepped up when he was needed and he ws lost in one of the towers.

Before the musical, Frodo and I visited our niece Eliana and we were the first in the family to see her new apartment:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
After the show we visited our good San Diego friends Mitch and Miyo, who were in NYC for the birth of their first grandchild.  They took us out for a “high-calorie dinner.”  They get it.  And tomorrow I will go out again; I plan to enjoy my one more night in a bed.

“Scout, Frodo, I’m getting off here.  I’m jumping back north to hike the White Mountains again.”

On the PCT after 1670 miles, a hiker close to us hiked in two miles after a zero day, sat down alongside the trail and said, “I’m calling it.  I’m done. I’m going home.”  There was no discussion to be had.  He turned back and the rest of us had mournful faces.  It felt as I someone had died.  
Buck is leaving.  We gave him hugs; wished him well.  I won’t write DF&B for a long while, maybe never again.

I hope Dot and Franky are going to be okay.

Frodo goes home tomorrow and as one last gift she is slackpacking us again and bringing us lunch.  At the end of the 20 miles, the shelter is near a road so she is going to sleep with us.  That is, with me.  It will be great to share that AT experience with her.

Today the hike was largely on nice trail tread with mild ups and downs.  We had two views, one across Nuclear Lake (Why Is it called that??) and one on a hill after a 600-foot climb.  
By day’s end we had passed 37 northbound hikers and there are at least 15 more camped here at the shelter.  But I wonder.  The NOBO crowd is going to peter out and then disappear, probably in just a few weeks.  Then it will only be us.  There is one SOBO one day ahead of us, two that are two days ahead, and we don’t think there are any that are one day behind.  Will we feel lonely?  Will we like having the woods to ourselves?  We’ll see.

He was that happy to see me go?!?) this time we’ll only be apart for a little over two weeks.  (Frodo: oh.)  Before she left this morning and wished me a final, “Make wise decisions,” she snapped a photo of my snazzy new hiking duds.  What do you think?  (Frodo: Oops.  Yes, I took the photo that morning, but I posted it in yesterday’s entry. But here it is again, complete with goofy hair:)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
After an hour and a half on the beach we moved on and had a late lunch after 11 miles, on a grass field next to one of the 8 roads we crossed today.  I knew we still wanted to cover 8 more miles, I know it was already 2:30, but the grass was so soft and Dot looked so peaceful napping.  I laid down my head, too.  I even dreamed.  Of trekking poles.  
We started up again after 3:00 pm.  We’re going to be setting up camp late.  If that’s the price of admission for the beach and a nap, I’d gladly pay it again tomorrow.

It’s hot now.  The thermometer pushed near 90° yesterday and easily the same today.  Any climb drenches me and my shirt in sweat.  It’s now nearly 10:00 pm and I’m in my tent wearing only my skivvies, my sleeping bag still in its stuff sack.

We miss Buck.  I have to start getting used to writing D&F, not DF&B.

We often call the AT “The Green Tunnel.”  Today as I was about to leave an open powerline clearing, there was the Green Tunnel waiting to fold me in its embrace:

Today the beach.  What’s on for tomorrow, the zoo?  
Actually, yes.

I knew the AT would be a different kind of trail, but not this different.

…and we’ll see the elephants and the kangaroos…

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574274,"Where are the birds?  I’ve listened closely the last 15 minutes and there has not been a single peep, chirp, or warble.  I’ve been taking close notice because a while ago I wasn’t at all and I walked a third of a mile off trail.  But it’s 7:00 am, I’ve climbed a wooded hill and I am hiking along a high ridge.  There should be trilling, and calls protesting that I’ve invaded their space.  Still nothing.  Has Rachel Carson’s vision come true?  From a silent hill, silent spring.
I met a northbounder, a twenty-something young woman.  “My name is Grade School,” she said.  “How’d that happen?” I asked.  She pointed down to the slightly undersized shorts she was wearing.  “These were my grade-school gym shorts.”   So, I ask myself, why can’t I wear my running shorts?  (Frodo: Because you are a 65-year-old guy who I hope wants to have at least a LITTLE dignity!)  I know, I know, stop beating that dead horse.

When I posted that photo of me at the beach yesterday, that skirted the slim margin where a guy of 65 can show his legs.  Out here so many of the guys develop calfs (Frodo: calves, maybe?) like blacksmiths or weightlifters.  My legs look pedestrian and pale, as if I rode the bus everyday.  (Frodo: You have great legs, strong and wiry like a runner.)  But not a day goes by that I am not grateful for those legs.

With five miles down I emerge on a highway that fronts the Hudson River.  It’s 9:00 am and I meet Pamela and her husband Arnie.  They re taking me out for breakfast.  Big smiles and big hugs even though I’m already sweat soaked in the early morning heat.  Pamela and I have a deep and unique connection.  In December 1983, while engaged in the first known attempt to transit the Pacific Crest Trail in winter, Pamela’s daughter Jodi and her boyfriend died.  I got to know Pamela as I researched the story and I became a part of it when Frodo and I accompanied Pamela a year ago to lay an engraved stone alongside the trail at Jodi’s last campsite, near the spot where she died.

In the town of Cold Spring we are looking for a restaurant whose name begins with “S”, that Pamela wants to take me to.  Older minds are wonderful things.  Here’s a photo of Pamela and me today:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
After breakfast they took me back to the trailhead and I headed across the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson.  A third of the way across Nature started to call loudly and that bridge suddenly seemed a mile long.  At the bridge’s end was the entrance to the zoo and, most thankfully, a bathroom.

I continue on the AT and the trail’s white blazes go all the way through the zoo.  These are almost all rescue animals, such as a fox hit by a car.  At the bear enclosure we hit the lowest spot on the entire AT – 145 feet.  Here’s a photo of the bear enclosure:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Why are there dozens of fat vultures all around the bear?  Two of the locals told me that at Halloween the zookeepers thought it would be a good idea to decorate the edge of the bear enclosure with Jack O’Lanterns.  The vultures and the bear ripped them into chunks and now-rotting shreds.  Once something ends up in a bear cage, you can’t easily get it out.  The locals were laughing the whole time they told me the story, and they promised to send a photo. 
After the zoo, the trail climbed out onto Bear Mountain, probably the biggest climb since Mt. Greylock: 1.7 miles and 1300 feet.  
All afternoon the sky beat like kettledrums, thunder crashing, threatening.  At mile 14 I was set to meet NomNom, with whom I had hiked occasionally on the first half of my CDT hike in 2015.  She had tried to surprise me last Thursday before Kent, CT.  She’d hiked nine miles but missed me; we hiked faster than expected that day.  So today we vowed to keep in close touch by text and phone.  The sky opened up in a torrent.  It was so, so nice that within minutes Dot, Franky, and I were looking out at it through the windows of NomNom’s car:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... It lasted an hour, about the exact time it took to consume NomNom’s treats and chat about events since I last saw her in early May, when she came to help us host PCT hikers for a few days.  So good to see her. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I am camping near the shelter two miles further along.  One of my two bagels from NomNom is already gone.  It’s past 10:00 and I need my sleep.

I knew what pink blazing is – when a guy follows a girl up the trail, hoping to catch up with her and meet her.  But I had never heard its opposite term [Princess alert] – banana blazing.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574339,"Did it ever cool down last night?  I could have been warm enough in just my undies.  I don’t think it dropped below 70°.
I am hiking early, well before 7:00 am.  The climbs aren’t big today, but even from the start I’m sweating enough that you could wring out my shirt and fill a shot glass – or at least it feels that way to me.  I see a buck, probably just two years old, judging from the size of his velvet-covered antlers.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I thought of making some clever play on words about our friend Buck who left us two days ago.  But that still feels too raw to be the subject of humor.  And it weighs on me that Dot & Franky and I may be diverging, too.  I want to push on for a big 20-plus-mile day today to set up to make a motel in Vernon tomorrow.  That’s how the trail works.  We’ve had a great run.  But you have to hike your own hike.  Even if we separate now we’ll likely hike together again.
Here's a red salamander I spotted today: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Late morning the trail turns rocky and ahead soon are tough spots like “lemon squeeze” and “agony grind.”  It seems like every other northbounder can’t wait to tell me how rough and rocky the next ten miles will be.

I do have to throw my poles 30 feet ahead and take my pack off as I drop into the body-wide narrow defile that’s the “lemon squeeze,” http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   I can’t help but wonder how these same folks will react in The Whites, the Presidentials, and in Maine.  In each of these 100-foot-long features (not miles long as they were up north), there is a marked Blue Blaze “Easy Route.”  Again, that’s a luxury they won’t have further north.  
I’m setting up to do something I’ll bet never has been done before.  You see, I have pretty consistent cell coverage here on the AT in New York.  I’m on the Board of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition and we have a telephone Board meeting at 6:00 pm Eastern Time.  Just as I pass a 50-foot waterfall, the meeting starts.  I hike two miles while participating in the the meeting.  I’m sure I’m the first to attend a CDTC Board meeting while hiking another long trail.  
I’m now set up just off the top of the Eastern Pinnacles.  I hear far-off thunder and hope it stays that way.

 Tomorrow I have 15.5 miles to a shower, town food, a bed, and air conditioning.  I’d like a short break from the heat.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574420,"At 7:12 am, I pass the first road, highway 17.  It is the site of a trail-famous hot dog stand.  But it’s 7:12 am.  Sigh.
As I hike on I think of the best hot dog I’ve ever had.  I don’t think I’ve had one since May of 2015.  I like them grilled, not boiled, with relish and lots of mustard.  For a special treat I tuck an extra-crispy slice of bacon alongside the hot dog in its puffy white-bread bun, top it with grated cheese – jack and cheddar – and put it in a toaster oven set to broil, for 40 seconds.  Make two of them. (Frodo: then feel your arteries clogging up!)  They are that good.  Aren’t nitrates one of the essential food groups?

And by the way, I just stepped over a handwritten note on the trail – “rattlesnakes here – hiding in rocks.”:http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
But the best hot dog I ever had was boiled.

The trail yin and yangs me today.  I really want to make these 16.4 miles today, to reach a bed, air conditioning, and a milkshake.  The day starts smooth, great trail tread, and I click along at well over a 2-mph pace.  (Imagine saying that last sentence if you were in a car, or on your bicycle for that matter.)  then I hit open granite ridges that go on for miles.  I knock back my estimate of arrival time at the road from 3:00 pm, to 4:00 or even 5:00.  Then between 11:00 and noon the trail goes into a phone booth; Mr. Hyde disappears and Dr. Jekyll emerges.  I’ve crossed the New York/New Jersey line.  Maybe it’s a good omen.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The rocks, the short climbs where I have to use my hands, the descents where I throw down my trekking poles and use my rear end for extra grip, all disappear.  I am rolling along.  Not 4:30, not 4:00, but maybe 3:30, I am thinking.

And I am thinking about second chances.  There is another hot dog stand at highway 94, fifteen miles after the last one.  I’ll walk the short 0.2 miles down the road before I call the motel for a lift.

On the AT I’ve had trail magic maybe 10 to 12 times over these two months.  On the PCT easily 20 to 30 times over five months.  And the AT northbounders, I’ve heard it said, get trail magic at every road crossing for the first month or more.  On the Continental Divide Trail, all five months, I think it was three times.  One cooler with sodas in Colorado, a hiker who had stayed with us pre-paid our room in Leadore, and the third was….

We were 5 days into our CDT hike, in the dry bootheel of southern New Mexico.  Frodo was with me for that section.  We’d hiked cross-country that morning and were nearing a water cache, the last one before Lordsburg, and our water bladders were near dry.  There was a white truck parked 200 yards away on a dirt road.  “Must be Border Patrol,” I thought.  There was plenty of drug running in the area.  As we neared the water cache a man walked out from the truck and intercepted us.  “Would you like hot dogs, sodas, and chips?”  “Apple"" parked his truck there each day for a week or so.  One to eight hikers might come by in a day.  He’d bought a surplus Border Patrol foot-pressure sensor, which he buried under the trail.  We’d stepped on it and the buzzer on his belt beeped.  Hot dogs boiled fresh for us.  I ate my two and half of Frodo’s second.

Oh, and here's another turtle I saw today:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I reached highway 94 at 2:30!  In Maine 16 miles was a big day; I might finish at 8:00 pm.  Today at 2:30.

But as I’m salivating for hot dogs and I see “Mitch’s Roadside Grill Stand” ahead, there’s probably something I should tell you about Frodo and myself and second chances.  Yes, we are as deeply in love as I describe, but we were once separated, for two years.  There’s more than enough blame to spread over the both of us.  Few would have predicted it, those 30 years ago, but we fought to find a path back, and we did after two years.  (Frodo: We wouldn’t cherish each other as much as we do, had we not gone through that experience.)

They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  The photo at the top is of my second chance hot dog stand.  It made me glad I missed the first stand.  And the proprietor, Mitch, turns out to be a man with a golden heart.  He sells hot dogs, but gives away joy.  “Here, I’ll loan you my car,” he says when he finds out I’m thru-hiking and have errands to run in town.  But it’s not a car I need, I need shorts and a t-shirt so I can wash all my clothes at the motel and go to dinner and the store while they wash.  Mitch walks away and comes back with a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.  “Here.”  
Mitch is clean and sober since October 31, 2006.  When he drove me to my motel, after stopping to treat me to a milkshake, I hugged him and found myself tearing up.  I reached around my neck.  I am going to give away my AT Karma Necklace, the necklace I want to keep but must someday give away to a special trail angel.  “No,” Mitch says, putting a hand on mine as I start to lift it.

Second chances.  Two hot dogs.  Meeting a saintly roadside hot dog seller.  But the second chance I most value, and thank my lucky stars for every day, is Frodo.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Eastern Pinnacles

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574557,"From that note on the trail, to the chatter of northbounders, I guess I am in rattlesnake country.  Which should I fear more, the 1-foot baby or the 3-foot adult?  The answer is the baby.  Nearly 80% of all adult rattlesnake bites are “dry,” no venom injected.  And adults have enough rattles to make noise.  Babies can’t control their venom yet, look innocent (if any snake can) and don’t give a loud warning.
The same holds true for my worst AT concern, the #%*@#% ticks!  The big eraser-sized dog tick, large enough to give you the heebie-jeebies, nearly never carries the parasite that causes Lyme disease.  The pinhead-sized deer tick, and its baby nymph form that’s smaller still, are the ones to be feared.  I had a nymph on my ankle yesterday.  I tweezered it off and put the remains in a ziplock bag for me to look at under a 12x magnifying glass when I get my bounce box in three days.  In the meantime, I took a single cautionary dose of Doxycyclin.  Sigh.

But it’s supposed to be cooler today.  And last night I slept in a soft motel bed.  When I opened the door from my room, everything was wet - rain.  I walked off, umbrella in hand, because that’s what we do.  
But I got lucky, and if this day has a theme that’s it – lucky.  The overcast sky holds off, then is rent with slices of blue, the only drops on my head when the wind shakes the trees free of their wet burden. I hike two miles-long sections that are not just flat, but nearly billiard-table flat.  The first includes the “New Jersey Turnpike,” nearly a mile of elevated boardwalk.  What, are we in Atlantic City? http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
By noon, I had covered nearly 12 miles.  Now don’t get me wrong, it’s still work, but those miles of Bonneville-Salt-Flats-level trail were also out in the open, full sun, and a part of me felt like this was an on-trail zero day.

Just past noon I veered a short 0.4 miles off trail, crossing from New Jersey back into New York and into quaint Uniondale.  I sauntered into the two-aisle country store market and scored today’s New York Times.  On the PCT, a country store like this would likely have only a local weekly advertiser paper.  Here on the AT, it’s the New York Times, which I carried over to Annabelle’s Pizza, where I ordered two big slices of pizza and garlic knots.  Here I am, in the middle of a 20-mile day, eating fried bread balls slathered in garlic, reading the New York Times on Annabelle’s front porch.

On the way back to the trail I stopped in the store and bought an ice cream drumstick, which I munched and licked for a half mile down the trail.  Some northbounders I passed even reported my “ice cream hiking” to Dot and Franky later in the day.

And then 4 miles later, with 4 miles left to go, I follow a sign off trail “water 100 yards.”  But the sign didn’t say donkeys.  Cute, adorable, letting you hug them and scratch behind their ears, three-foot-tall donkeys.  They were next to a well, and three northbounder ladies had already named them Gertrude and ____ (Frodo: Some name that definitely starts with an M and looks like MoLun.  Sorry, that’s the best I can do!)  They were petting-zoo tame. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
(Frodo: Here's a random photo of the trail Scout sent me for today:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  )
The last four miles did involve some climb and I blew by the next shelter to move on a half mile to the New Jersey high point.  There’s an elevated platform reachable by two flights of stairs and I even thought, “I could cowboy camp up here.  The breeze will keep away the bugs and the view will be amazing.”  On the PCT, Frodo and I cowboy camped 60% of the nights, on our groundcloth under the open sky and stars.  On the AT I haven’t yet.  Too buggy, too rainy, and with a green tunnel nearly everywhere, why bother?  But there were two groups of local day hikers on the platform at 6:00 pm when I climbed up.  I moved on and set up my tent a third of a mile away.  In a green tunnel.  I ate my dinner.  I started to wind up my journal entry.  I was in my sleep clothes in my bag.

At 8:30 I checked my phone and turned it off airplane mode.  There was a text from Dot.  “Scout, where are you?” Then, “We are at the New Jersey high point.”  Were they cowboy camping?  On the platform?  Yes!  “Scout, come join us.”  But my tent’s up.  I’m tucked in.  It’s deep-shadow dusk.

But why am I out here?  I pack up willy-nilly, cram my tent body unfolded into my pack.  I make my way back with my headlamp, back the way I had come.  Near the platform I turn it off and creep quietly up the stairs.   “Scout!” Dot cries, “You came!”  Can I tell you what joy it is, to see them again, to have taken this “second chance” to sleep on the platform.  The moon is near full, brilliant.  We see fireworks off in the distance, booming an echo off these cliffs.  The two of them giggle and laugh.  I feel triumphant.

“Dot, it’s your fault I’m not done with my journal yet.”  There was this whole last chapter to add.  How many shooting stars will I see?  What will the sunrise look like?

Just after 1910 the word “hiking” first came to be used.  Before that you went “tramping” in the woods.  Hiking meant making miles, heading out at a clip to reach a goal.  
John Muir:  “I do not hike.  I saunter.”

Scout: “Today, I saunter.”

We are serpentining our way along a long granite crest.  It’s still a wooded green tunnel, but oftentimes on both sides of me, out past the green, is blue sky.  That’s how I know I stride a ridge top.  (Frodo:  Wait; I thought you were sauntering.)

For 15 miles.  At 2:00 pm, yes, that’s a 15-by-2 (Frodo: Some saunter!), I make a right turn at a New Jersey turnpike at Culver’s Gap.  Gy’ Tavern awaits.  It’s an old-fashioned, dark, billiard-tabled bar and grill, cash only, with 15 Harley’s parked in front:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Out back are picnic benches and chairs along a lake. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  That’s where I sit right now, grilled cheese sandwich in my tummy, Dot with a pizza in hers, and Franky digesting a burger.  It’s not the set of Cheers – more raw.  On one wall are photos of the time Babe ruth visited and went hunting with Gyp. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

This morning, cowboy camping on the wooden observation platform on the New Jersey high point, Franky and I each tried to guess what the low was last night, including the chill factor.  It was the coolest it’s been in weeks.  Franky: 48°, Me: 47°.  On the paciic Crest Trail, out of 150 nights we almost never had nights with a low as high as 47° and on the CDT I don’t think there were any nights that warm.  On the entire AT hike, including that first week on the International Appalachian Trail, I think the lowest it has ever been in maybe 39°.  One more way the AT is different.

I’m in my tent, snug and warm.  I’ve got the tent at Battle Station, rigged tight for wind and rain, on ground that should drain well, if it starts raining during the night.  It’s 10 miles tomorrow to the AMC Mohican Outdoor Center and Hostel.  After 8 days and over 140 miles hiked it’s time or a zero day Tuesday.

Shall we talk of surprises once again?  As you may recall, Frodo’s and my track record for surprises is pretty spotty.  The whole 40th Anniversary day back in June, when we tried to surprise each other and we both failed.  (Frodo: The surprise aspect was a failure, but the time together was great!)
This morning was supposed to be pretty straightforward.  It’s 10 miles to the Mohican Outdoor Center, an old Boy Scout Camp where they have a store, grill, and bunkhouses.  I am zeroing there tomorrow.  Okay, I wake up and the rain starts.  It’s a complication, but not a big one since I have my umbrella. I even manage to get my tent packed up before it gets too wet.  But in the meantime, as I walk atop a ridge that normally affords a half-dozen view spots – today there’s only fog to be seen - …..

Much plotting has been going on.  The princesses and their parents have been planning to surprise me.  The family had traveled from San Diego to Washington, DC, last week for a conference and they plotted out an intercept path, with Frodo’s help.  She was like radar control guiding a fighter jet.  But the target, me, kept changing his plans.  “Frodo, I’m hiking a couple miles beyond the shelter because it’s supposed to rain.”  (Frodo: He actually hiked FOUR extra miles.)

They first planned to get me in their sights yesterday; they’d surprise me at Culver Gap, at Gyp’s Tavern.  But the van they rented went rogue and they had to drive all the way back to the airport to exchange it.  That set them back and so Culver’s Gap wouldn’t work.  Then the princesses got to bed late and were awakened early – maybe there were peas under their mattresses.

Their next plan was to cross paths with me this morning.  They really, really wanted to meet me on the trail.  They practically bought out a bakery’s supply of Danish pastries and donuts.  
I pass the first road after 3 miles, rain heavy on and off.  But I have my wonderful cone of dryness.  Umbrellas rock.

The princesses’ dad sends me a text.  The game is up.  I tell him I’m four miles from the next road, which is also the last road before the Mohican Outdoor Center, so their last chance to catch me on the trail.  “Two hours,” he thinks.  “I should be able to drive there in two hours.  I hope Scout keeps a 2 mph pace.”  But then little Jessica started throwing up as they hurried along the winding road.  “Keep going,” she said.

I neared the road.  If they are not there, I’ll walk on.  It’s raining, after all, and our plan B is to meet at the Mohican Outdoor Center.

The princesses’ van hits the trailhead.  “Is he past yet?”  They drive down the road to where the trail picks up again.  “Did we miss him?”  They drive back, park the van, and the girls emerge wearing brightly colored rain gear.  They open the back of the van.  “Should we wait long?” 
And that’s the sight I see as water clouds my eyes: three swaths of bright pink, purple, and blue, Catherine, Sophia, and Jessica.  The water is not from the rain.  I am so overjoyed to see them.  
Dot and Franky soon join us.  The large apple Danish and 8-inch diameter cinnamon rolls are great.  But it’s these people I treasure.  Here are a couple of photos: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... and http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
There’s a phrase I use, “Voting with your presence.”  Showing up at a friend’s wedding even if it’s far away and the timing is inconvenient.  Being at nearly every one of my kids’ cross-country meets, field hockey games, swim meets, soccer games.  It means more than pastries or any gift.  As difficult as it was, the princesses and their parents voted with their presence this morning, to let me know I’m important to them and cared for.  And I am ever so grateful, and so much richer.

The memory of 10 miles in the rain, of my dear green tunnel and the hard-earned but fog-blocked views fade against the memories of people I love who’d chase me hither and yon, and know I’d do the same or them.  Here we are, sans Monica, the Princesses' mom (Frodo: That makes her the queen, then, right?!): http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574618,"(From Frodo: Scout's entry for this date follows this guest entry, but maybe should be read first.  I can't figure out how to change the order!)
The plan was simple enough.  We would be traveling north from Washington, DC to New York.  Scout would be walking south from Maine to Georgia.  We will intercept Scout on the AT!  In practice, it proved to be slightly more challenging.  After a series of rental car mishaps, we soon realized that catching Scout on Sunday in an easy spot on a main road was not going to happen.  Sandy (Frodo) was providing support from afar, keeping us up to date on Scout’s planned movements to help coordinate a “surprise” rendezvous.  Frodo was becoming concerned “perhaps we should get Scout involved.”  A daddy veto overrode the wishes of the three princesses to continue for a surprise.  Scout was texted early Monday morning, and he called while we were in the parking lot of the only local grocery store we could find.  Good thing, as he was already 4 miles further along than anticipated!  
The weather forecast was bad.  Steady rain is a nuisance but the foreboding warnings of severe thunderstorm activity with 2 inches of rain in a short period of time seemed worth heeding.  We would have the morning before the worst of it arrived, according to all three forecasts.  Scout advised we meet at the AMC Mohican Lodge, his destination for the night, later in the day (dry and comfortable with a nice lounge and kitchen).  We had other plans!  Off we drove in the drizzle, then steady rain.  There was only one remaining place the trail crossed a road, and google maps could get us there just in time based on Frodo’s estimate of Scout’s pace.  We chose the shortest route, which would take us through the Delaware Water Gap NRA.  The roads became progressively smaller and less paved, more like a series of large holes full of water, with small patches of pavement in between.  Then we were directed onto a NPS “service road” and it was getting more interesting.  The “Old Mine Rd” that came next was marked “closed in winter” which, based on the condition, seemed wise.  The youngest princess became car sick.  We’d have to make a stop.  Finally, we found the trail intersection and backed our rented van into the trailhead area.  Did we miss him?  Based on Frodo’s estimate, Scout should have reached that point right at the time we arrived.  We’d have no way of knowing, so we decided to set up and wait.  Seats folded, tailgate up for rain protection, high calorie food gifts from a local bakery just about to be taken out.  We had been there not 5 min when a tall figure, shrouded in an umbrella, became visible through the trees at the trailhead.  No doubt – it was Scout.  We hadn’t even been there five minutes.  Frodo was spot on with her estimate of Scout’s pace!  
Here’s the rest, from the perspective of the three princesses:

Princess Sophia:
We woke up in the morning and drove out to where the Appalachian Trail in New Jersey meets the road for Trail Magic.  It was a long twisting road and our dad was driving fast so we didn’t miss Scout.  The littlest princess got car sick so we had to stop for a few minutes.  Finally, we got to where we wanted to be and got the minivan and the patries ready for all the hikers.  We had bought tons of pastries and donuts for the hikers that came by.  Then we waited for Scout.  One of the princesses had to use the bathroom so we thought we might drive back to the bathroom.  But then we saw an umbrella and a figure emerge from the trees.  It was Scout!  He was so excited to see us and we were so excited to see him.

We took Scout to our car, which we had folded down all of the seats so we had room to sit away from the pouring rain outside We all sat and told stories while Scout ate food from the bakery that we had brought him. Scout told us all about cowboy camping under the stars. It sounded like tons of fun! Soon we saw a woman emerge from the forest. It was Dot! She had woken up later than Scout so she had arrived later than him. She sat down and ate food, too. We traded stories and dad talked about how he and Barney had played tricks on people with a toy penguin. We were all laughing and having a great time. Then another figure came walking down the path toward us. It was Frankie. Frankie came to the car and had some pastries too. He told us all about how he had taken care of a deer and even showed us pictures. Everybody was laughing and joking around. Two north bounders walked by us and my family offered them donuts, which they accepted gratefully. Soon they left and continued hiking. Scout took AT tattoos out of his pack and we put the AT tattoos on immediately. They were sparkly gold and look so pretty. All too soon, Dot, Frankie, and Scout said they should probably get going for the three miles to the Mohican Outdoor Center where Scout was going to spend the night. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  My mom took pictures of us all together and then we said goodbye. It felt good to see the smiles on the faces of the hikers when we gave them treats! Trail Magic!

 

Princess Jessica:

My dad asked if we could slack pack Dot, Scout, and Frankie to the Mohican lodge center while they hiked to it. When we got there, we went into the lodge and it was very nice. They were still hiking so we hiked part of the AT to try and meet up with them. We came across Dot and Frankie because they had ran part of it until they got chilled. We kept hiking but we couldn’t see Scout. My dad went ahead, but couldn’t see him. We waited a few minutes, but no Scout. We wanted to hike out farther, but it was really foggy so we couldn’t. So we started hiking back, but then in the distance we saw Scout!!!!!!!!  He told us that he was thinking that it would be so cool if we hiked out to see him. He was so excited that we hiked out to see him. We hiked back to the Mohican lodge center and my mom was waiting for us. She was taking pictures of us. Dot and Frankie were inside on the couch. We looked at the menu for lunch and ordered it.  Scout and Sophia had the corn chowder soup and I had the grilled cheese.  I ate half and Scout ate the other half.  We had to go back to our hotel but I wanted to stay with Scout.  We said goodbye and we drove to our hotel.  We were finally back at the hotel but we miss Scout.

Frodo will be pleased that we watched Scout consume many high calorie treats and baked goods.  We left him stocked with additional treats and drinks.  The rain never really stopped, but the thunderstorms never arrived.  We took a longer, but better maintained, route back to the hotel, smiles all around.  Trail Magic!

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574743,"How do you measure the passage of time?  With one push of a button on our phone we get the time.  Out here, if I could see it, I’d note the phases of the moon.  Sundials use a shadow to mark time passing.  But bug spray? 
Today I felt how long I’ve been out here hiking.  The first day on the trail after Mt. Katahdin I thought it was time to stop borrowing Rolling Thunder’s bug spray.  At the Abol Bridge store, the last spot of civilization before the 100-Mile Wilderness, I bought a spray bottle of Ben’s 100% DEET.  Yesterday it ran dry.  On the bottle it claims, “lasts ten hours.”  No, I can testify it lasts two months.

How long have I been out here?  One full bottle of Ben’s DEET.

Dot and Frankie slept last night at the home of a friend of Dot.  They were back here at 9:00 to pick up their hike while I stayed on for my zero day.  They’d left one burden – they left most of their gear behind and are slackpacking – and picked up another.  At the end of a stout 20-foot cord was Dot’s friend’s dog.  Just before they walked off, Frankie was heard to say about the over-rambunctious canine, “It was your idea to bring him.”

On the serious side, as they hiked off I thought, I might well not see them for at least two weeks.  No more texts a half hour before hiker midnight, “Scout, come cowboy camp with us.”  They are a day ahead and over the weekend they are heading off trail for a 2-day music festival. Godspeed.  Here’s a photo of them with the dog and one of my last view of them.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
One door shuts and another opens.  “Scout!” “Sheriff!”  It’s been over ten days.  But at noon here she was in the Mohican Outdoor Center Lodge picking up her resupply box.  “Try this.”  It was a key lime cookie.  Flourless, but with butter as the third ingredient.  We positively tripped over each other telling new stories.  And she had Nature Boy in tow.  He started on June 20th and was zooming – ah, to be in one’s twenties – but the pace took  a toll on a foot and Sheriff helped him decide to slow down.  They are hiking back out today and will be ahead, but I expect we’ll soon cross paths on trail.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Do I have to confess (Frodo: I can’t read the word that Scout uses here – it ends in “tion” – but I think “confess” works fine) that I got lost two days ago?  It was a 23-mile day – now, that’s not shabby – but I reached Frodo on the phone and eventually noticed that the trail had stayed very, very nice while we chatted for 15 minutes.  Yup, when I hung up I realized there were no white blazes to be seen.  A third of a mile off trail… Did you notice I didn’t say it was her fault?

It has been probably the laziest, most wonderfully laid-back zero of the trail.  Almost no one here.  The NOBOs are petering out, it’s late season at this old Boy Scout camp, and I even napped late afternoon – no dreams about trekking poles.

It’s a Tuesday out there, I hear.  For me it was a hiking Sabbath, a real day of rest.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","AMC Mohican Outdoor Center

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574826,"Since I’ve been on the trail I’m not sure which I’ve heard more from northbounders, “Pennsylvania” or “Rocksylvania”.  Like the Munchkins telling Dorothy, “Follow the Yellow Brick Road,” NOBOs have told us Pennsylvania is rocky.  Very rocky.
Today was a day of views.  I don’t think I’ve had so many since I was above timberline, on Mt. Moosilauke, a good month ago.  I actually lost count of the view spots today, but I’ll bet there were 15 to 20.  (I’ll just leave the bare fact sit without comment that I could have that number of separate, good views on the PCT or CDT in an hour.)  But I loved the views we had today and lingered at many.  Here are two of the views from today:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I think it finally happened.  The great NOBO die-off is upon me.  I saw only seven today, and spoke with almost every one.  Here are Turbo Turtle and Cheese (which is the answer to the book title “Who Moved My Cheese?  (Frodo: Not sure which is which.) http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
With access to my bounce box at MOC, I restocked my supply of custom AT tattoos.  I am tired of having to feel parsimonious.  I want to be profligate.  So when I came across a backpacking summer camp group today, 8 middle schoolers and 3 counselors, I didn’t have to think, “If I give out 11 I won’t have any for tomorrow.”  They were so earnest and eager, I asked them, “Would you sing me a camp song?”  They debated and first came up with sad ones, including “Dona, Dona,” which is real sad, about a calf bound for market for sale and slaughter.  Of course the CIT girls at our camp changed the chorus to “Donuts, donuts, donuts, chocolate covered, jelly and plain…”  I led the 11 in a repeat-after-me silly camp song, and then I gave their counselor the 11 temporary AT tattoos.  It seems Journey’s End Farm Camp was founded during World War II for European refugees.  Here’s the group and me: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Ten miles along I entered my 8th state.  It was on a bridge with semis whipping by a few feet away from me.

I am now 10 miles into the Quaker state, in a Pennsylvania state of mind.  The trail is more rocky, but not all the time, and I can still move at a decent clip.  The border was at Delaware Water Gap.  Why “Delaware” is attached to a feature dividing New Jersey and Pennsylvania, I don’t know.  (Frodo: Umm.. well, maybe it’s because you just walked over the upper part of the Delaware River, that flows down to Delaware and empties into the Atlantic?  Sometimes, Scout, you really set me up to be snarky!)  Right after we entered PA we had our first stiff 1000-foot climb in a week.  The last one was on the day with the zoo.

Finally, another funny ‘fess up.  My bounce box has a baggie of tiny toothpaste tubes for me to swap out when my trail one runs out.  Frodo had found a couple left in the hiker box at our house, after our hiker hosting season and added them.  One was in German.  I put a dollop on my toothbrush at the MOC.  What is this, axle grease?  I tried to spit it out of my mouth.  Turns out it was denture adhesive.  (Frodo: Oh, no.  Oops.  I was the one who assumed it was toothpaste.  I mean, it had “dent” in the name, what else could it be?  Now I know.  Sorry, Scout!)  And on that note….","AMC Mohican Outdoor Center

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574896,"The spring has sprung.  A leak, that is.  Because it is dry.  A bit of damp earth is all there is to show for what I thought would be my morning’s water source.  We’ve been seeing some of this the past weeks, but rarely so blatantly.  Wolf Rock Spring is dry.  And so am I.A bit later I ran into the warning sign and saw this wasp nest, which I gave a wide berth:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Since I entered Pennsylvania I have been hiking gap to gap.  Yesterday we left the Appalachian spine to drop to Delaware Water Gap.  Today in 8 miles I’ll drop into Wind Gap, then 8 miles later into Smith Gap and 8 miles after that, Little Gap.  I hope to camp just before Little Gap after 20 miles.  But at Smith Gap, 14 miles ahead, I am being met by Rich, the brother of a dear friend and uncle of one of the three boys our son was practically raised with.  Rich’s wife has their car, so he is renting one to rendezvous with me on dirt-road-served Smith Gap.

But I’m getting ahead of myself.  Let’s talk Rocksylvania.  Sure enough, the trail at times feels like a cobblestone street unearthed, each stone a crazily-tilted ankle biter.  But, and I’ll get to the bottom line first, it’s not so bad.  At least if the first 30 miles is any indication.  The hard parts are rarely that long and any time I can average over two miles per hour on the AT, keeping the effort in the “reasonable” range, is okay by me.  Maybe Rocksylvania is setting me up, like a pool hall hustler.  “You just wait, Scout.  Double down and make your 20-mile-a-day plans.”  To be continued…

We never know when we’re saying good-bye for a long time or, for that matter, unexpectedly saying hello.  A mile along this morning, “Wait a minute, who’s that hiker finishing packing up?  It’s Franky!”  He and Dot dropped the 20-20-10 plan and reduced their mileage before they pick up their concert-bound rental car.  And, voila! They’d camped a mile in front of me.  The two of us made short work of the five miles to Wind Gap.  (Frodo: Okay, I’ve been figuratively biting my tongue, but I can’t take it any longer.  Your math today has been TERRIBLE!  8+8+8 make a little over 20 miles??? 8+8 = 14??  And now 1+5 = 8??  You said it was 8 miles from where you started to Wind Gap!!  And you were a math major at UCLA!!)  Again we gave hugs good-bye.  Dot (Frodo:  You didn’t even tell us about her – was she with Franky?? Did you catch up to her later?  I must be having a grumpy day.) promises to send me photos of them on the concert ground’s “Lazy River,” the two of them slowly floating on inner tubes.

At my Smith Gap meeting time, 1:30, I am a few hundred yards away, and here’s Rich striding up the trail.  This man knows his birds and his plants.  So many times we could have used him on the trail.  Here we are:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Over lunch at a classic small town diner, Rich says my bird population collapse concerns are both real and not.  This time of year for the birds in the highlands is a “quiet time.”  After nesting, many are getting ready to migrate, and many have dropped down to the lowland fields to rob farmers of ripening corn.

Rich asked great questions about SOBO hiking and at the end said, “I think the thing I admire most is that you survived the blackflies.”  Rich feels that either blackflies should go extinct, or we should.  
I was back on trail by 4:15 with 3.5 days’ worth of food and my first Italian water ice.  It was root beer flavor and got me 1.5 miles along:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...Now, 6 miles later, I’m in my tent near Little Gap.  A rock concert a mile away wafts its beat into the wilderness, including the song “I would walk 500 miles.”  I’m eating Knorr stroganoff noodles chased down with a Canada Dry ginger ale and when I finish this I’m going to pick up today’s New York Times.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574984,"At 6.5 miles the descent into Lehigh Gap is the hardest I’ve had since the Whites, hundreds of miles ago.  Steep, 1000 feet deep, more big boulders than the Whites, slippery, high-angled open granite.  My trekking poles got quite a workout.  I’m very pleased to report no falls.
I started the day thinking 22 or 23 miles, but just past 20 at highway 308 is a tavern, hiker friendly it says in my guidebook.  I call and Ken, the owner, answers.  I can sleep out back or he has a B&B with rooms open.  
“Hiker Friendly,” we see that term often in AWOL’s guidebook.  And I know there are places that are neutral or slightly negative or maybe even a bit put out when hikers hang around outside with their packs or fill up every electrical outlet charging their little vampires – smart phones and battery packs.  But I never thought I would see a sign like the one blazoned across the front door of the one building near the Lehigh Gap road crossing.

“NO HIKERS”

The springs have been dry and I needed water.  I set my pack on the ground, unhooked my water bladder, adopted a humble look and opened the NO HIKERS door.  The receptionist stared, I shuffled my feet and looked down, “I don’t want to use the bathroom, but could I get a little water?”  I got a nod and a reluctant point of a finger toward a water cooler.  I couldn’t help but think of a different era when the sign would have been “NO COLORED” and it wouldn’t have been one business, but an entire region.

It seems that all day long almost every northbound hiker felt compelled to warn me about the “Knife Edge.”  Even Ken at the tavern seemed to scoff when I said I’d be there at 7:00 pm.  “You got the Knife Edge in front of you,” he warned.  
And then with 5 miles left it started to rain.  Hard.  Umbrella up.  What I said about Maine rocks holds true for Pennsylvania rocks, too.  Trust no wet rock.  Is it my imagination or did the rain just pick up as I climbed up onto the Knife Edge rocks?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  More often than not I’m in a three-point stance, the other hand holding the umbrella.  It’s about two football fields long.  One step, one foot plant at a time, a ridge-top jumble of rocks like a small slice of the Mahoosuc Notch.  I am so glad when I drop off it and re-enter the green tunnel.  Here's the view from the Knife Edge:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Rocksylvania it is:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Now I sit in a tavern with two other hikers, jawing away with trail stories.  One is a Special Forces AT Relay team member, part of that relay group we met some of back in Vermont.  And this guy knows our friend Wilderness Bob from the PCT in 2007. I’m dry, I’ve got a burger ordered and … Is this thru-hiking on a rainy 20-mile day?  Life is good.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575154,"Let’s talk fires.  Fires on the AT are the same.  And they are not.  On our PCT thru-hike, 165 days, we had three campfires.  I only lit one.  Tony lit one and Laurence the Spring Guy lit the third.  I like campfires.  But when you’re thru-hiking you don’t have the time, you are bone tired, hiker midnight, 9:00 pm, comes around so fast, there’s no wood or no fire ring or it’s against regulations.  On the CDT it was the same.  And for the AT, all of that has held true.  Even though almost every shelter has a fire pit in front of it.  I think I’ve been at two campfires so far. 
Fires.  The PCT has multiple sections of trail closed at the moment, due to forest fires, current and past.  In the first 700 miles of the PCT it’s evident that at least half the forest or chaparral around the PCT has burned in the past fifteen years.  (Frodo: Hmmm… I think I need to see data to be convinced it’s that much.)  Charred tall trunks, stumps, and dark ash.  On the CDT dozens of miles in Glacier and Yellowstone are full of 40- to 50-foot-tall burnt skeletons of trees, the ground sterile since the fire was so hot.  And those fires were in 1988.  In 2008,  800 fires were started by lightning in one huge storm in northern California, many along or near the PCT.  Hikers trekked under an orange sky, bandanas over their faces.

In almost 1000 miles on the AT I have seen one small burn.  One.  I took a photo of it.  It was less than a football field in size, not a thousand acres.

One more way our big three trails strikingly differ from each other.  
My left heel and Achilles tendon are hurting.  There I said it out loud.  (Frodo:  Well, sort of.)  It gets worse as the day goes on.  Some days better than others.   I’m sure Rocksylvania is not what the doctor would order.  It’s always hard to know what to do.  I’m sure hiking 20 miles a day on rough terrain would also never be part of any prescription.

Turbo Turtle, the woman NOBO with Cheese, two days ago said she had been experimenting with drawing turtles in the registers.  Here are two:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
There were some rocky stretches today http://www.trailjournals.com/j..., but a lot of fine trail, too.  I’ve been hearing about the big copperhead snakes lurking in Pilot Rocks.  I’d been shown photos, and a few hundred yards before that spot a day hiker came at me with an out-of-breath warning.  But as hard as I looked, I didn’t see any snakes.  (Frodo, insert here some snarky but loving comment.)  (Frodo: Nothing I could write would be as amusing as your parenthetical!)

I am in my tent with a glass of red wine from local overly-equipped one-nighters.  I topped 21 miles and tomorrow morning I’ll drop into Port Clinton, PA, for a visit at their “Peanut Shop” and hopefully knock on the door of the members-only Firemen’s Club and get some of the only pizza around.

And today some fantastic news finally started circulating in my family.  I’ll share it with you soon.  (If Reuben Scout sends me another “Please, Scout” video, make that right away.","Black Mountain Tavern and B&B

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575241,"“6”  The countdown begins.  Frodo boards a plane on Thursday morning and I’ll see her on Friday morning.
7:00 am.  I slept in.  I don’t think I’ve ever slept this late on the AT.  I just now sat up and started packing.  But Port Clinton is 4.7 miles away, the trail goes right through it, and there’s no reason to arrive before 10:00 when businesses open.  At least I hope they’re open on a Sunday morning.

I just passed the perfect “pocket” campsite; everything there in a 20-foot circle.  It was one of those “Bill Gates assignment to his assistant” moments.  “Build me the ideal tiny campsite.”  At mile 969.2, 3 miles before Port Clinton, there it was, almost right next to the trail so Bill wouldn’t have too walk far.  A well-laid-out rock fire ring, a flat tent site.  “And by the way,” Bill says, “have a small gurgling stream run right through it, between the tent site and campfire.  But not too wide so I can easily step over it.”  Yep, that’s what bisected the perfect spot of heaven on the AT.

…. Stay in a motel?  On the first night in 2.5 weeks since I’ve seen my bride?  Come off trail a short ways instead of cramming into our tent?  No brainer, right?  (Frodo:  I made the request more so he would have a chance to take a shower!)

For this Friday night it is.  Done.  But 10 years ago we had our first night together on our PCT thru-hike and we’d been separated a few days before then.  (Frodo: We started a few days apart, since I felt the need to go back and teach for a last few days to prepare my students for the AP Biology exam.)  It was  early May, storming with gale-force wind gusts.  We were in a tarptent that barely kept out the rain.  A few hundred yards away we knew there were cozy cabins available, there at 6,000 feet in Mt. Laguna.  I mentioned something about the cabins and Frodo said, “I would be so not opposed to that!”  I thought she was joking and chuckled, though she couldn’t hear it over the wind.  Boy, was I obtuse.  It was still so cold and windy the next morning that we made breakfast in the campground bathroom.  That’s when she told me she’d been serious.  Oops.

Today was great hiking.  A few rocky-ish sections, one long drop into Port Clinton (where the trail went right through the canal town founded in the early 1800s), then a 1000-foot steep climb and easy sailing for 15 miles the rest of the day.

But does a fat “I own the trail” rattlesnake count as easy sailing?  The day hiker following behind me didn’t think so, but I whipped out the phone and caught this video.  https://www.facebook.com/barne...   And here’s a photo:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I’d written yesterday’s paragraph about fires on the trail early this morning, actually.  And wouldn’t you know, this afternoon I walked through my first prescribed (planned and man-made) burn alongside two miles of trail.  The understory was all burned out, but the large trees were unscathed except for mild charring on their trunks.  The state game department does these burns to promote deer forage.

I have to show you the photo of my 15-minute wide-eyed foray into Port Clinton’s one open business, a peanut and candy store:  (Frodo: Scout confessed to me that he spent almost $20 on candy there.)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

“1000.00”   “13.2”

I know, Frodo is probably waiting for me to add these up wrong.  I’ll show her – I’m adding up nothing today.

The “5” is of course “6” subtract “1”, the days left till I see Frodo.  
“13.2” is the number of miles I have to hike to reach a milestone.  Since mile 100 at the end of the 100-Mile Wilderness I have been a 3-digit midget.  As I write this I’m munching on lunch – smoked Gouda, Waverly crackers, dried fruit and Raisinets (Frodo: lovingly purchased, packed and mailed for you by your adoring wife, who DOESN’T just sit at home eating bob-bons all the time.)(Not that you ever said I did, I just want your readers to know that.)  And I now have under 4 miles to the – drumroll, please – 1000-mile mark.  I will step over the stones in the trail or whatever is there and I will be a 4-digit AT GIANT!

Today, I don’t think any climb or descent was over 200 feet.  And if it was, it didn’t feel like it.  The whole day we traversed long Blue Mountain.  At noon, after only 6.6 miles – I got a late 8:30 start from the Rock & Sole Hostel – I had a pleasant surprise.  I heard a “hello” from a hiker in what otherwise had been a day empty of people.  It was Nature Boy.  I saw the young Dane a week ago with Sheriff, when I was on a zero day.  Unfortunately, Sheriff had to leave the trail for the time being and Nature Boy is hiking on.  I was surprised he was behind me; I had thought they were a day ahead.

We leap-frogged toward the 1000-mile point, both eagerly anticipating it.  It would be about 0.2 miles before the 501 Shelter.  I thought about taking my picture next to the marker, thought about how that would feel, calling Frodo if I could.  
At 4:20 pm I thought I should be there.  I checked my map.  I checked the AT Guthook map app.  I had hiked a full 0.1 beyond 1000 miles, a city block.  I had seen nothing.  I walked slowly ahead.  There was Nature Boy at the shelter trail junction.  “Did you see anything?"" He asked.  And there was nothing right there either.  What are we SOBOs, chopped liver??

NB and I started gathering rocks.  I laid my trekking poles down to provide a guide so the numerals and letters would be in a straight line.  “1” “0”  Take a picture now; it only says “10!”  “0”  “0”  and “SOBO.”  Then we made a rock cairn of Pennsylvania’s finest.  Here are photos:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And then I posted it on Facebook.  Now it truly is real.  
NB had done 20, and I walked on to do 6 more and make 20 miles myself.  We said our good-byes.  He’ll probably catch me again tomorrow.

A mile later I hear footsteps.  It’s NB.  He tucks in behind me for the next hours, till I’m well over 20 miles.  We find a rough campsite at 8:00 pm, we chat and tell life stories.  What great company.

The trail is often on an old carriage road today and it passes once-bustling towns.  Old is a relative term; these towns existed in the early 1900s.  Rausch Gap, once a coal and mining town of a thousand in the early to mid 1800s, is now nothing more than a sign and some flat spots.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Out West there’d be ruins, tumbled-down walls, old stoves.  But here pervasive rain, snow, and summer heat have scrubbed the remnants from the face of the Earth.  The West’s dry climate might well have preserved them.  On the PCT and CDT there were old cabins, mines, iron stoves.
I hiked with Nature Boy for ¾ mile and then I stepped aside for him to move out at a 20-year-old’s pace.  I’m still trying to give my left heel and Achilles the pace they deserve.  I plan 20 miles today; NB plans 24.  When will we see each other again?  
It’s now lunch 10.5 miles along.  I’m at Yellow Village, another town that is today only a trailside sign, and I have seen no one in the last 10 miles.

I did walk through the longest meadow since New Hampshire. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Actually it must be an old once-cultivated field.  Come to think of it, have I seen any natural meadows?  They form in the Rockies and in the West, dotting the PCT and CDT.  But not here; why?  Manter Meadow on the PCT is 30 miles long.  
I did have some good nature photos today.  Above is a bee lazing on a lavender-colored flower.
At first I thought it was pretty and I started to bend down to get a picture of one.  But then I realized that they dotted the trail.  Red, yellow, and orange leaves.  It’s mid-August.  I started hiking weeks before the summer solstice and now the first signs of fall approaching are upon us:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The other change is even more dramatic; we are losing daylight like a balloon with a pinhole losing air.  In Maine, first light was by 3:30 am and now it’s after 5:30 am.  Right now it’s 8:52 pm and it’s been dark for at least a half hour; when I was in Maine I could still be reading without a headlamp.

It’s a fine balance out here – appreciating your hike and not rushing, yet getting in the miles so you can finish before snow, all the while gauging how your body and mind are faring.

Tonight I’m tired, a bit too sticky, and I wish the AT didn’t assign those personal gnats to buzz-bomb my ears and hover an inch away from my eyeglasses.

I know the cure – a pizza in Duncannon tomorrow.  After 16 miles the trail winds right through town.","Interstate 81 stealth camp

(Frodo: Hmmm…. 2 is correct, since Scout will see me Friday morning and today is Wednesday.  But yesterday he had “4”.  I have been biting my tongue, figuratively.)

It’s 8:30 am, an hour and a half on the trail, and a tall southbounder (me) meets a tall northbounder.  What does one immediately say to the other? 
(Play the Jeopardy theme while you think.)

Answer:  “Yay!  No more spiderwebs!”

And two miles later I can tell you exactly where he camped, the Peters Mountain Shelter, because the @%#&  spiderwebs begin again.

For my left heel and Achilles I have been religiously taking aspirin.  I even got some more at the Rock & Sole hostel Sunday night.  But when I took two of those yesterday they were absolutely bitter in my mouth.  What was wrong with those Rock & Sole aspirin?  That was the wrong question.  This morning while reaching into that same pouch of white pills I turned it over and looked at Frodo’s handwritten label – Flagyl!  The question should have been, “What’s wrong with the doofus taking the pills?”

And speaking of things going wrong, when I sat down on my freshly blown up NeoAir pad last night I heard a “sproing” I’d never heard before.  I turned it over and the above photo shows what I saw.  Something has burst inside.  I hoped it would last the night.  (Frodo: Well, did it???)
Today’s hiking was more ridgetop – meaning I knew it from my map, not because I could see it – with a final long drop to cross the mighty Susquehanna River and walk the streets of Duncannon.  There were white-blazed telephone poles, just like in Hanover.  
For weeks I’d received warnings about the Doyle Hotel in Duncannon.  Nice owners, but the place is ancient, they can’t keep it up, and worse.  My sprung air mattress tipped the decision and I went in with minimal expectations.  I am the only hiker here (and with the NOBOs essentially gone and early SOBOs thinned out, I may be the only one in town).  I have the corner room suite, and I didn’t expect air conditioning or a refrigerator (which I don’t have).  The queen bed, sheets, and pillows are clean, even if the other furniture is far less than pristine.   For $25 and with the smiles of the two owners, I’m happy and satisfied.

But as a flip side (Do you remember “45” records with a second song on the “flip” side?) let me show you some photos of the Rock & Sole Hostel from last Sunday night and what $45 got me.  Two generous home-cooked meals plus this:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Finally, my hat’s off to this section’s hard-working trail maintainers.  Take a look at this photo.  Do you know what it is?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I saw not one, but many of these.  That is a large-bore, hardwood blowdown, painstakingly cut with an axe!  I can hear the sharp thud of each hit and the snap of those woodchips hitting the ground.  That’s hard work!  Thanks.

In this case it is not “The Loneliest Number.”  And speaking of that song, do you remember the name of the band that sang it?  Hint: the name came from a graphic term describing the coldest of Australian nights.  ""Mate, on a cold night you grab one of your dogs and sleep with it.  On a real cold night you grab two dogs.  And, Mate, on a night to freeze off a witch’s ___, now that’s a 'Three Dog Night.'”

On the AT so far the coldest night has been one where you might reach for a lap dog.
The AT Guidebook, (AWOL’s Guide) had a “very rocky” warning for the climb out of Duncannon to Hawk’s Viewpoint.  How do I say this…. The “rocks” were steps, the climb was sedately steep, and there was nary a wild rock jumble in sight.  Not complaining here.  Just observing.

And speaking of guidebooks, maps, and apps: I am the Troglodite out here.  On the PCT up till a year ago more than two-thirds carried paper maps, the “Halfmile” maps.  This year it went down to one-third, with almost all relying on smartphone PCT-dedicated map apps, either Halfmile or Guthook.  Here on the AT, 90% rely on the AWOL Guide, a list of waypoints with 0.1 to 6 miles separating them, combined with an elevation profile in the background.  Of course everyone relies on the nearly ever-present white blazes.  A small percent use the AT Guthook smart phone map app.  Hardly anyone uses a topographical map.

Except me.  “Remember these,” I say as I pull my map out of my pocket.
Trailside ripe corn-- I was so tempted to liberate a few ears. (Though someone told me it's grown for animal only consumption, not human):  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Mid-morning, traveling a largely lovely trail with small ups and downs, I hear footsteps behind me.  “Just Simon” is SOBO and zooming.  He actually started on the PCT in the spring.  “You’re Scout.  I should have stayed at your place.”  He’d had a difficult time using public transport to get to the PCT’s southern terminus.  After 200 miles, he saw the incredibly high snow ahead and made his own wise decision.  He jumped across the country to start the AT.  Simon is German and figures he may only have one chance to hike a long trail.  He slowed down his planned 30-mile day to hike with me for a few hours.  We both were thirsty for company.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Here’s something incongruous.  On the better known trail, the AT, maybe one of 15 thru-hikers is an International, well under 10%.  What is it on the PCT?  Simon agreed with my own observation – a third to 40% of PCT thru-hikers this year were from outside the U.S.  Why the striking difference?

I know you’re expecting an answer from me in this paragraph.  But I’m still pondering the possible reasons.

Tonight I am in Carlisle, at a Super 8 motel, a quarter-mile off the trail.  No one would want to sleep on my wounded Neo Air pad.  So I’m making a wise decision and sleeping on a bed.  
Tomorrow in the morning at one of the half dozen road crossings I’ll see ….  Frodo!

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575712,"“0” And I am not going to argue whether zero is a number or not. I know what it means today. It means I see Frodo in a few short hours.
I hike out of my motel room and feel naked. My pack was left against a wall amid almost all my gear. I have shoes, socks, shorts, shirt, AWOL Guide pages, map, phone, baggie wallet, toilet paper baggie (Yes, with the empty baggie to “pack it out”) and my room key. Why, I could cram it all into a quart Ziplock. It’s not exactly (Princess alert) bare-assed Hike Naked Day, but as I walk the third of a mile back to the trail with 12-wheel semis buzzing past me, I feel unclothed.
Frodo is meeting me in 4.9 miles. I am slackpacking today. In nineteen days since I last saw her, I hiked 18 full days, none less than 16 miles, over 340 miles total. I need to be kinder to this wondrous body that has carried me so far. 
I am going to change out my gear again. I am making backpacking decisions I thought I’d never make. I am going to ship home my rain jacket. What, hike without a rain jacket? I am going to ship home my down puffy jacket. But, I love my 11 oz down puffy! I have not used either for their intended purpose for well over a month. My umbrella is all the rain protection I need in these warm rains, and the down puffy has only been used as a pillow. I’ll buy a 2-ounce blow-up ultralight pillow. I think my base weight is now down in the seven pound range.
The reunion with Frodo is joyous. I got all steamed up beforehand. (No I didn’t forget to put in a Princess alert there.) I was hiking through open Cumberland Valley corn and soybean fields in direct sunlight.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  My shirt is soaked through. Any hug she gets from me will be steamy.
It is soooo good to see her again.
At eight miles I walk into the village of Boiling Springs. The trail literally goes by the front of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Mid-Atlantic Region office. My good friend Karen Lutz is the Regional Director. I get to see her in her office glory and she see me glowing from my thru-hike. We have a great lunch—pile on those calories. Her office has a photo of Karen on her 1978 AT thru-hike. My, what a big pack you have. A Kelty Tioga.
The stream outside the AT office had the cleanest water I have seen on the AT. It’s flowing directing from the springs of Boiling Springs. This is “boiling” as in the action of boiling up out of the earth, not hot temperature. Karen: “It is 54 degrees now in the height of summer and it is 54 degrees in the middle of winter."" It is so good to spend such time with a dear friend this way.

 I hike back out at 12:30 http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and Frodo picks me up before 5:00 at a road crossing with nearly 17 miles done.  In one of two ""rock mazes"" mentioned in the guidebook I christen a section the ""Lemon Snuggler"" since it reminded me of the Lemon Squeeze back in New Jersey, but less tight.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... I am going to treat myself to an Epsom Salts bath. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575799,"I am sitting on the porch of Pine Grove Furnace State Park General Store. This is a big deal. This site, next to endpoints Katahdin and Springer Mountain, easily ranks as one of the five best-known places on the AT. It’s fabled. Hikers get bragging rights for what they do here. Or don’t do here. At Mt. Washington’s cog railway, hikers moon the train. At Virginia’s James River Bridge hikers (a few) jump off the 700-foot-long span. Both these activities are illegal and the second one highly illegal. And don’t forget Hike Naked Day. Nature Boy can’t. He engaged in the activity back in Maine, and later that day, no longer au natural, a woman commented, because earlier she had not been looking at his face, “Oh right, you were that nature boy.”
 I didn’t moon the cog railway. I do not intend to jump off a bridge. And with the black flies in Maine I would have been crazy to bare my skin. But here at mile 1087.5, I have reached the site of The Half Gallon Ice Cream Challenge. Eat it all in a single sitting. Do it and your award is a tiny wooden spoon. I don’t hesitate. I walk right in and order …. “A hamburger and fries.”  No. Nyet, Nein, Nada. But when I walk out the door and onto the trail I’m carrying a two-scoop, hand-dipped ice cream cone. This is my challenge—in the wilting heat keep that sticky, melting goodness from making a gooey mess. Scout’s own ice cream challenge. Take a look at these three photos. The first is how happy this hiker is with her ice cream challenge, the second is me holding up one of those half gallon tubs (Frodo: Have you noticed that the containers you THINK hold a half gallon of ice cream actually hold only three pints, or 3/4 of a half gallon?  Yeah, the ice cream companies hope you haven't noticed that!)  and the third is how happy I am with my own ice cream challenge.   http://www.trailjournals.com/j... http://www.trailjournals.com/j... http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
 In seven miles I will pass another site that should be up there on the AT top-five list. The AT mid-point. How can its name not be right up there with Katahdin and Springer? Well, how about because it keeps jumping around. The trail’s length keeps changing. There is actually a sketchy, temporary mid-point marker on a post that the AT Museum folks move as necessary. A beautiful, mid-point monument does exist and I came to it at mile 1091. It has gravitas, it has stature, but any emotion you feel there is based on a lie, any photos taken there are empty of the meaning. Here I am at the first monument. I wonder how many southbounders get there and think they are at the real thing—only to find out three miles later that the cigars they smoked, the whisky they drank, was consumed too early. 
 Frodo Lives!  And better yet, she’s here, not in San Diego, that fabled place where rumor has it I still have a home, and a waterbed.  Yep, we still sleep in one after all these years. That waterbed is one of the reasons she fell in love with me, so I’m not getting rid of it. Frodo is slackpacking me today, and it’s a double-positive whammy, as not only am I hiking with an ultra-ultralite pack but the trail is pretty darn nice for all of today’s 19-plus miles. Mid-morning, she met me at a road and I stepped out of the woods to wait for her. I am standing at the Appalachian Trail Road sign, that has to be right, isn’t it? (See photo at top of entry). But she is parked 200 yards down the road, in the official AT trailhead parking lot. Exactly where she said she’d be. Oops. At least I wasn’t hiking down the trail in the wrong direction.  (Frodo: THIS time!)
 Mid-day I entered Pine Grove Furnace State Park, the site of an early American iron forge. It’s a luxury of riches. Hmmmm, there’s a white sand beach, swimming area, lifeguards, snack bar and showers, fields of cut grass to sit on, there’s the Appalachian Trail Museum and, of course, the General Store and its big ice cream challenge. I met Frodo at the General Store. We had lunch and then strolled over to the Museum. I so hope someday the PCT has a museum like this. I personally have or have access to trail history artifacts just as dear and moving— the1959 Mulford Trail Ride original movie camera, 1954 Boy Scout PCT relay original uniforms, and original photos and items from the 1930’s YMCA PCT Relay. May it be so someday. In the meantime here are two photos, me before a display of AT icon Avery’s trail tools from the 1930s and of the original Katahdin sign that was replaced with a new one in 2010.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
 Of all things, Continental Divide Trai icon Jim Wolf has his photo up on a museum wall. It’s a group shot titled “Pioneer Long Distance Hikers.”  And there in the first row of the sixteen AT early “end-to-enders” kneels Jim Wolf, CDT guidebook author and founder of the CDT Society.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   and http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the end of the day, Frodo hiked in a mile to meet me. I emerged at a gravel road trailhead and knew this was the Appalachian Trail half-way point. I think back to the start of my hike, that first day with Rolling Thunder, getting stuck in a mud bog up to my thigh, the first tick on my body that night, and it all seems so long ago. I had no idea what lay in store for me, I had no idea who I would meet, become close to, and now I am here. I knew tears would well up. I hugged Frodo and unabashedly cried on her shoulder. Thru-hikers focus on how far we have come, not how far we have to go.

 And I made a short video. On the day of our 30th wedding anniversary, ten years ago, we crested the PCT high point, Forester Pass, more than 11,000-feet higher than the AT mid-point, and there at that moment we renewed our vows. I added one to those I had made 30 years before. I promised, “To amuse her.” I think this video that she took, is one more step on that path. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Now on to two zero days—I need it after hiking 18 full days out of the last 19. Now to go into D.C. and see our daughter Jordie’s new house for the first time.

After spending a restful night in Jordie’s guestroom, we head out at the oh-so-civilized hour of 9:00 am.  Jordie drops us off at a metro station.  We ride the metro to the airport, then fly to St. Louis.  
Well, that must seem kind of random.  Why are we headed to St. Louis?

I’m sure some of you can figure out why, but if anyone reads this months or years from now, it will be less figure-outable.

We are headed to the center line of The Great American Total Solar Eclipse.  From the St. Louis airport we will drive 2 hours west and a bit south to stay at a little B&B out in the countryside one mile from the center line, so we should have 2.5 minutes of totality tomorrow about 1:14 pm.  
We just decided to do this a few weeks ago.  It seemed at first that it wouldn’t happen, since all the accommodations in the path of totality appeared to be fully booked.  But I was a bit resourceful and a bit lucky, and here we are.

Yes, I know it might seem a bit profligate to fly somewhere to spend two nights just to see an eclipse, but it’s kind of fun to do this kind of thing on a lark, and we figure that’s one of the reasons we worked hard in our careers.  Besides, it’s a TOTAL solar eclipse!
But first we have some family and friends to visit.  Scout’s dad has a first cousin, Jay, here in St. Louis.  He and his lady friend Esther take us to a late lunch at O’Connell’s pub, famous for its burgers.  And they are good!  The photo above is from our meal in this venerable establishment.
Then we head to Ballwin, just west of the city, to see the Jacobsmeyer family.  Scott Jacobsmeyer is on the Board of the Pacific Crest Trail Association (Scout just finished three 3-year terms on the Board, including three years as Chairman.)  Scott has hiked with us in the North Cascades of Washington and for a section of the CDT in New Mexico, including crossing the upper Gila River literally a hundred times.  He has five wonderful kids and the whole family has driven up from Texas to Scott’s parents house to see the eclipse.  (It gets confusing, alternating between “Scout” and “Scott”.)  Scott’s folks are very welcoming and we have a great visit.  Scout hands out his gold AT tattoos to all and sundry, and a couple are applied post haste:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

You won’t catch me indulging in eclipse mania.
 But they say that birds nest, chickens roost and the stars come out. When else will I ever have a chance to see a total solar eclipse?  It’s a nine hour drive to reach Tennessee, the closest point of the totality swath to where I was Saturday evening on the AT.
 Where was I today at 1:13 pm? Why was there spontaneous clapping all around me? Here's the main reason I took this two-day zero (In addition to the fact that my body would have screamed at me if I didn’t)—We were flying to see the eclipse. We flew from D.C. to St. Louis, rented a car and drove an hour west into the center of the totality zone. Two minutes and forty seconds.
Fifteen minutes beforehand the temperature started dropping as if it was 8:30 or 9:00, not mid-day.

Rocksylvania was the final insult to the case-hardened steel trekking pole tips.  They were down to a nubbin for a while, but they’ve been completely gone now for at least a week.

I’m glad the same doesn’t happen to parts of my body. 
How easy and how hard it was today.  On the one hand it felt like falling down the rabbit hole again, entering my Appalachian Trail Wonderland as easily as Alice entered hers.  On the other hand…

Our alarm woke us at 4:30 am.  We are almost two hours west and south of the St. Louis Airport.  Outside is all rain, thunder and lightning flashes.  On the road at 5:00 am.  Frodo is so grateful when the blind curves of the country lane give way to freeway.  (Frodo: I’m always the driver.  Scout hasn’t driven since he started this hike, I think.  And the driving conditions I hate are when I’m on unfamiliar roads, in the dark, in the driving rain.  Like this morning.) 
At the airport I think there were more people in the security line than the entire total of AT Northbounders, the lines seeming to be at double the normal capacity but still moving well.

Rental car, airport, plane, airport, rental car, our daughter’s house in North Bethesda, then Frodo driving freeway and country lanes again, all to deposit me at 3:30 back at the AT where I left off on Saturday.

My feet remember what to do.  It’s 8.6 miles later and I’m at a double shelter with covered picnic tables and I’ve come full circle because as I write this it has started to rain.  Hard.  But I am okay and dinner awaits.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I can feel the two days of rest.  I must make sure I don’t squander its good effects.

I owe you an apology.  About a week ago I teased about another surprise.  It turns out I jumped the gun - I don’t have permission to spread the word on social media.  
So let me give you two things.  First, Reuben “Scout” sent a photo of himself in his first Scout uniform: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   And his dad shared that Reuben, age 6, had never folded a single piece of clothing.  They found Reuben in his room, carefully folding his shirt, one quarter fold and then another.  He must have felt it was so special that he needed to fold it.  
Second, and finally, I have direct word from Dot and Franky.  At the end of the day Saturday they were 50 miles behind the spot where I got off, and this morning they passed that spot and are now about ten miles ahead of me.  On Friday evening the three of us and Frodo will all be staying at the home of a “trail community” friend just outside Harper’s Ferry.  A reunion is in store.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576201,"Let’s begin today with earnestness and hope.  A thru-hiker has to have these aplenty, but I’m not talking about me.  I’m talking about the dozen freshmen from Franklin & Marshall College I passed on the trail this afternoon.  They were so earnest, full of life, eyes alert for discovery on this pre-college trip.  They were so full of hope and good things.  And they were out here.  They’d met a thru-hiker who started “in Maine?”  One more great possibility, an open door in front of them.  What will these kids do?  Who among them will save thousands?  Which will be the good husbands and wives?  But most important, they are spending five days in the woods.  You may have heard of the book with the provocative title, Last Child in the Woods.  These kids, these treks, ensure that will never happen.
Last night two northbound section hikers were in the second of the side-by-side shelters and they said there was a local flash flood warning until midnight.  The rain pounded on and off till the wee hours.  Every time I woke I thought, “Let those clouds squeeze it all out now.”  And though it was still spitting when I hiked out at 6:45 am, umbrella in one hand and hiking pole in the other, it soon stopped.

The sun came out, but the temperature is clearly 5 to 10 degrees cooler than yesterday’s near-ninety.  Nice.

The trail was pleasant http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and I made good time.  Pennsylvania tried to throw some last rocks my way, but it felt half-hearted as I neared the border.  
Dot and Franky gave me good reasons to be looking down at my feet, a bit of yin and yang.  On the happy side, the two wrote “Hi, Scout!” in still-damp soil. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... On the other hand, they also texted, “Scout, watch out for a baby copperhead snake.”

I’ve seen many examples of “green tunnel.”  The AT has them in more flavors than Baskin-Robbins has of ice cream.  But today’s seemed near perfect, a full overlapping, encircling canopy, like a green-encased Bridal Bower:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Maybe today I ran in to the last true northbounder.  He had his t-shirt with the AT white blaze, still had the Katahdin mindset, volunteering right away that he needed to make 20 miles a day.  Every day.  I saw in the next shelter I passed that he’d written a long paragraph about it in the register.  No zeroes.  And he’d have to maintain his pace in The Whites and through Maine.  I wished him luck.  What else could I do?

I’ve heard from little Jessica of the Princesses.  She liked the short video of me crossing the mid-point.  Of course she did.  So, Princesses, what sort of video would you have made if it was you?  (Yes, that’s a dare.)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576266,"I admitted defeat once in this journal.  Do you remember?  It was Day 2 at the Blue Moose Restaurant.  I was roundly defeated by a platter of pot roast and fries.  I was being facetious.
But if there’s one thing I’ve strived for in this journal it’s to be honest, to tell you how I really feel, good and bad.

So often I’ve written about feeling triumphant.  “I’ve summited Katahdin!”  “I’ve reached my 5th state.”  Maybe that's a theme for my hike, for any thru-hike.  How often in your daily life do you get to celebrate milestones?  Here, at times it’s every day.

What I’m getting to, is that I have to be honest in defeat.  Last night I felt defeated, a sad sack, a mangy cur slinking off with its tail between its legs.  The first note on my guidebook pages after the notation for the Pennsylvania-Maryland border says, in Maryland, “camp only in designated campsites.”  Just after 6:00 pm I’d reached Pen-Mar park in Maryland, just past the border.  It’s popular; even on a weekday night there were many picnickers.  They lingered to watch the sunset from this high point with a clear view to the west.  The park rules are explicit: No Camping.  The next shelter was 4 miles away.  I’d already hiked over 20 miles and I guess I was thinking I could stealth camp nearby.  But people lingered past dusk.  Past dark.  Cars were actively driving by.  I leaned against my pack in an out-of-the-way spot, but I was still clearly in view.  I started to wonder, what if there’s a night sheriff patrol through the park?  What if it’s a late-night hang-out spot for local youth?  We often joke as thru-hikers that we’re homeless, but I felt like a vagrant hanging out near a park.  Honestly, I got spooked.  I’ll camp anywhere in the woods; doesn’t scare me.  But this edge of civilization did.  
Just before 9:00 pm I pulled the plug.  “Do you have a room for the night? Can you pick me up?”  I felt defeated.  Frodo assured me later that it was the right thing to do, but I still felt I crawled away, head hung low.  (Frodo: My husband is being entirely too hard on himself.  He didn’t know there wouldn’t be any good place to stealth camp near the park.  You just have to figure out, for whatever set of circumstances you are in at a given moment, what’s the best course of action.  I’m glad he took care of himself.)

Today is a new day – what a difference that makes.  I am hoping to do over 23 miles.  Frodo picks me up early from the B&B and facilitates a slackpack.  The hike starts well.  I find another message on the trail, FF followed by a heart, then D.  I put twigs into the indentations carved in the mud, so it would stand out better, and texted a photo to Dot and Franky. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   I get a text back from Dot an hour later, just an emoji with its tongue sticking out.  
I run into two freshmen trekking groups from Johns Hopkins University.  More eager faces.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Today I have enough tattoos.  One gal already has five or six temporary tattoos on her face. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
And there’s another trail challenge I’m ignoring.  The four-state, 44-miles-in-a-day challenge.  But what undergirds that bone-jarring, joint-testing race against time is that the trail is good, to very good, to soft as a modern track & field track.  
And I finally get the mushroom video I’ve wanted to shoot!  Mushroom video??  What, do they dance like the mushrooms in Disney’s “Fantasia?”  No, this is even better; you’ll just have to watch it.  And make sure the sound is on so that at the end you can learn something interesting.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Frodo had lunch for me after 10 miles – a Subway sandwich and fried chicken.  Better yet, I had her company and her soft shoulder to rest my head against.

An afternoon of hiking brought me to another “last” northbounder.  Baloo was in a kilt; he was jaunty and not sad like many of the late NOBOs I’ve seen.  He started in April and will be happy to end wherever he is in six more weeks. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
More pleasant hiking.  Well over a 2-mile-per-hour pace.  And I’ve been meaning to mention Patsie.  I met her over a month ago, a NOBO.  And why was she memorable?  Above is a drawing I found of her on the back page of a register yesterday.   I didn’t particularly remember her face, but….   Yes, when I saw her on trail there was something odd sticking out of her pack.  “That’s a rosin bow.  For my violin.”  Here’s my photo from weeks ago. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   Boy, I would have loved to have shared a campsite and heard her play.

And speaking (Frodo:  Ummm, writing?) about odd things that hikers carry, here’s  the oddest I’d heard of this summer.  Care to guess?  I didn’t see it myself.  It’s a photo Nature Boy took. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And now, with 23.4 miles done, a fine cold dinner – smoked cheese, crackers, a bagel and grapes – in my belly, I am cowboy camping for the second time on the trail.  Dahlgren Backpacking Campground is not to be missed – running water, flush toilets, and showers.  No fee.  Cuddling with Frodo (and tonight that’s no euphemism).  ‘Night.","Pen-Mar County Park

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576308,"Any time you cowboy camp and there’s no condensation, it’s a good night.  (Frodo: But especially when your spouse is sleeping beside you.)
Today I am hiking 18 miles, slackpacking.  I will walk into the ATC’s main office at day’s end.  I will sleep in the home of a friend who also happens to be the National Park Service’s chief trail officer, overseeing the Appalachian Trail and 22 other National Scenic and Historic Trails.  
But the day starts with a sobering but happy reunion.  Not Dot and Franky; that will happen at the end of of the day.  “You look familiar.”  After hiking 3 miles I meet a woman with an intentional 4-inch-long blond cowlick stopped on the trail.  She’s northbound.  I can’t dredge up her name, but she recalls mine. And I know I’ve seen her.  She’s with a guy who doesn’t look familiar.  It’s Janine.  And you’re forgiven, too, if you don’t remember her.  On the night after I summited Katahdin, June 5, Rolling Thunder and I had dinner with Skippy John Jones and German Janine.  I had chicken parmesan.  The four of us posed with our shiny new AT tattoos.  
Rolling Thunder and I had wondered what became of her.  And why is she hiking north now?

“I had ten days in a row where I didn’t see another southbound hiker.”  She is going home.  To Germany.  But before leaving, she jumped a full week south and now is hiking north with her boyfriend Mark.  She is hoping to run into her southbounder friends; a kind of Farewell Tour.  She’d seen Franky and Dot this morning.  Now me.  We chatted excitedly for 15 minutes.  I gave her and Mark new AT tattoos.  “Here’s one for Rolling Thunder when you see him.”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Now she’s gone.  For good.  Loneliness.  I went 5 full days once without seeing another SOBO.  But one solace for me is all of you.

Remember Tinkerbell?  Remember when she was hurting so badly and we were all asked to “clap our hands.”  In my loneliest moments out here I can still hear a faint clapping.  All of you.  Thanks.

It has astonished me today how the contemporary world intersects with the trail.  I’m walking through echoes of heated battles, cannonball whizzing, musketfire, 23,000 casualties in a single day, Antietam September 1863.  And I walk through Fox Gap, Lamb’s Knoll, sites of fierce skirmishes.  At Fox Gap two generals died, one Union and one Confederate.  The Union general, Jesse Reno, has an 8-foot memorial monument surrounded by a dignified low stone wall.  Brigadier General Samuel Garland, Jr., C.S.A., has a 4-foot-tall stone marker with engraved words and engraved crossed Confederate flags.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I saw no protestors there and doubt if anyone will be pressing soon to remove the marker.  But it brought front and center the recent nighttime removals of statues of Confederate generals and supporters.  
The second contemporary world invasion came from an unlikely venue – Dot’s trail journal.  My off-trail journal transcriber runs like a fine Swiss watch.  (Frodo: He better say nice things, because that’s me.)  But Dot’s journal has had significant delays and she is on her second transcriber.  So what’s the delay now?  “She was one of the Charlotteville 19.”  Yes, those 19 protestors injured by the car that killed Heather Heyer.  Wow.

Hiking in to Harper’s Ferry in the late afternoon, I walked 2 miles on an 1830s canal tow path, passed over the Potomac River on a long railroad bridge, walked by the very armory John Brown took over on his ill-fated raid just before the Civil War, and then marched myself right in to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Home OFFICE.  Dave took down my particulars, then positioned me outside for my official photo, for their records.  I am Southbounder #24 for this year. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
Then Frodo whisked me away by car and we picked up Dot and Franky, who I haven’t seen for 15 days.  We drove to the home of Rita and Sean http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  for a wonderful dinner – with fresh sweet corn! – and wonderful company with the two of them and their neighbors Craig and Louise.  And I will fall asleep in a bed next to Frodo, all thoughts of loneliness held well at bay.  Good night.","Dahlgren Backpackers Camp

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576358,"The three of us are back on trail together again – Scout, Dot, and Franky.  No telling how long it will last.
We climb out of Harpers Ferry, nearly a thousand-foot climb, but it doesn’t feel like it.  Good trail tread, flat stretches between climbs.  And at mile 6 even more antidote for any trail loneliness.  Our daughter Nicky and her boyfriend James are waiting at the next trailhead.  And not only do they have sandwiches for us for lunch, they have backpacks that are full and ready for two days of AT adventure.  Nicky is an experienced backpacker, but this is James’ first-ever overnight.  (Frodo: When Scout hiked the CDT, Nicky and I joined him for a few days in northern Montana, when they were having a heat wave, it was in the high 90s, and there were so many flies and mosquitos that they would cover your bare arm if you stopped moving it.  Pretty miserable.  Glad it didn’t make her swear off backpacking for good.)
So how was James doing in the mid-afternoon?  You can’t see their faces in this “view” photo, but I guarantee they were both smiling.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At a shelter we found a swing, so Dot and Franky put it to good use.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
But just before we reached our campsite, we passed an ominous sign.  “Rollercoaster Ahead.”  For the next 13.5 miles.  I’ll give you a full report tomorrow, but here’s me registering my reaction to the sign.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Harper's Ferry

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576448,"Was my stomach queasy?  Did I hold both hands up high and scream?  After all, we were on the Roller Coaster.
No.  But the trail was wedded to ups and downs; the longish flat sections we’ve been hiking just off the Appalachian crest had fled like lambs before a wolf.  I’m told that the wolf was a road, that grasped the crest with teeth and claws, “Mine!”

Actually, it’s amazing that we’ve had such a long string of miles along the very crest of the Appalachian Mountains, a trail in a wide swath of greenbelt.  It’s amazing that there aren’t more roads, more homes, resorts, more civilization that have pushed this footpath off the crest.  So, so many people have contributed to this miracle that is the Appalachian Trail.  Friday night we stayed at the home of two, Rita and Sean, and tonight, after only one night in the woods, we are staying at the home of two more trail champions, Don and Amy.

After 3 miles on the ‘coaster, Nicky and James step off.  On James’ first backpack trip he jumped on for 12 miles with three thru-hikers.  Pretty brave.  Except for the booming chorus of cicadas that kept him awake last night, I think James had a good time.  (Frodo: I can attest to the fact that those critters are just cacophonous!) 
At just past noon I see ahead the swing of a shrub cutter.  Trail maintainers!  We love ‘em!  And there’s a familiar face: Sean, our host from Friday night.  He’s been hoping he would see us, and we’d been looking for him.  Here he is, carrying not one serious trail tool, but three:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  And for the next two miles, to the next trailhead, the side shrubbery was groomed back, clippings on the ground, as if the trail had been lovingly given a close shave.  Thanks, Sean!

Frodo brought us lunch – Whole Foods’ best.  Are we three spoiled?  Do we thank her enough?  And for the last 8 miles we slackpack, the three of us, officially leaving the roller coaster. See the relief on my face?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At day’s end, Frodo whisks us to Don and Amy’s house.  Don and I both serve on the Continental Divide Trail Coalition Board.  And, boy, did they feed us well!  Corn picked this morning.  Pasta.  Caesar salad.  Peach cobbler.  And apple pie.  It was the first time Amy had baked with apples grown on their own property.  And I bet it won’t be the last.  (Frodo:  Do you think maybe there’s an unhealthy obsession with food here?)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Clean and pleasantly stuffed, we head to bed, gear all ready to head out early.  No slackpacking.  No lunch brought to us.  For a couple of days we are back to trail norm.

“Tomorrow is going to be rough,” Dot commented at lunch while looking at her smartphone.  We’d covered over 14 miles and were eating a bit late, but the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter was billed as a three-star one, so we had aimed for it as a lunch spot.  The solar shower and horseshoe pit with horseshoes fit the bill.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Dot’s “rough” comment wasn’t about the upcoming terrain, it was about rain.  It’s been a while; at least a week.  I know how to do this.  But I can’t say that I look forward to it.  
Also tomorrow, Dot & Franky and I will part ways.  After 4 days together, I am going in to D.C. for a zero after 8 days of hiking, and the two of them are hiking on.

We did 23 miles.  Didn’t start till 7:30 am and finished by 7:00 pm.  There were two long climbs, but down here they know what switchbacks are and they know how to use them.  Liberally,  
I was asked a question at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Office last Friday.  It surprised me how hard it was to answer.  “What was your worst moment?  What was your best moment?”  You know me, I like to tell stories.  But the morning I fell 14 times on steep terrain in Maine was also the day the sun burst out and I was hiking out to meet Frodo.  And hiking the crazy Mahoosuc Notch I was with Sean, my son.  Maybe the one time I fell straight forward, ripping my pants open and tearing skin.  But none felt “worst.”  And among so many stellar moments, no one felt “best.”

I will miss D&F.  But I feel our paths will cross again.

",Tom Floyd Shelter,"Aug 28, Mon",23
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576678,"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park 
I hear the first ping on the shelter roof. It’s 4:21 am. My alarm goes off at 6:00 am. The fiberglass panel roof has been banging loudly, a raucous chorus shouting for over an hour. None of us move. How unusual is that? At 7:00 am Franky gets up, a woeful look on his face. The privy is 200 feet away. He starts to reach for his rain jacket. “Franky,” I call. I hand him my treasure. If you stood in front of me and waved 100 Benjamin Franklins, $10,000 in cold hard cash, I’d just laugh. My umbrella is not for sale. As he heads out under it’s silver cover, Franky’s as joyous as the children of Israel when the Red Sea waters parted before them. 
There is a scene in front of me that I can only imagine is misery. Five guys who are out backpacking for a few days came in late last night. Two squeezed into the shelter, two are in tents, but one chose to cowboy camp on the shelter deck. When it started raining he draped a tarp over himself. It does not look like fun. I shot this photo as he started to get moving. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I am the first one to head out on the trail. I step off the shelter platform, pack on my back, enter the rain and raise my umbrella. I must be beware of hubris, and I admit I‘m chilled in my running shorts and short-sleeved shirt, but I pop that umbrella open, hear the wet pings bounce harmlessly down its sides and I feel like a backpacking comic book superhero. I am Umbrella Man. 
We have sixteen miles that we’ll likely hike without taking off our packs. All three of us are in shorts and light shirts. We can only keep warm if we keep moving. I start climbing right away and I warm up. I have no jacket. I sent my down jacket and my rain jacket off trail. That’s the risk of going ultralight. You cut your margin for error slim. You have to “make wise decisions.”
What if my umbrella broke? I thought about that as I sent Franky off with it this morning. What if he caught it on the privy door and it snapped? Would I be up a creek without a paddle? I thought of what I carried. I have a ground sheet and I have safety pins and thin 3mm mountaineering rope. Here’s what I’d do. I’d drape the tarp over my head like Little Red Riding Hood, fix the front closed with a safety pin and with pins or rope tie crude sleeves. It would be a rude poncho. I’d survive. I’d make do--just like the man on the front deck this morning.   
Less than a mile after starting, a trailside sign welcomes us to Shenandoah National Park. This is no small deal. We have been looking forward to it and the Great Smokies since we started. We will be in the park for a hundred miles. Immediately--I would not have thought it possible--the trail gets better. It’s wider. Some places we can even walk two abreast. Quickly there is a self register box. In the rain we are supposed to fill in a form using these small pencils. We would have nothing more than a gooey, illegible mess. I take two forms and tuck them in a ziplock bag.
We chat and tell stories. We’ll be parting after 16 miles. Dot and Franky are hiking on six miles to the next shelter and Frodo is picking me up to go in to D.C. for a zero and to see all three of our children. We see trailside crabapple trees with fist-size green crabapples strewn over the trail. Dot loves horses—she competed as a teen—and this trail is so fine it would be perfect for ponies. Then Dot sees this sign and puts on her sad face. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I crammed food into my pockets this morning and put a ziplock with more into the outer pocket of my pack. Around noon, I pull out more food—two string cheeses, a cheese cracker six pack and a candy bar. It’s the only time I take off my pack in the sixteen miles. 
We’ve only once been over 2000 feet in the last few weeks, and we haven’t been over 3,000 feet since Greylock, five states ago. Today we climb to nearly 3,600 feet. At Harpers Ferry a few days ago we dropped to 400 feet. At one point we have ten classic, PCT-like switchbacks as we climb a hillside that in Maine we would have gone straight up. 
At 2:45, 16 miles covered, we cross a road and walk into the Elkwallow Wayside. We will hit a “Wayside” almost every day in the Park. These havens have a store, a grill and flush toilet bathrooms. We won’t need to carry much food on trail. 
We meet four new hikers! It’s our kin, our first cousins. Flip Floppers. They started northbound at Harpers Ferry in May, They reached Katahdin a short while ago and “flipped” back south to Harpers Ferry to continue on, Now, like us, they are hiking south to Georgia and Springer Mountain. We will likely see them on trail, four new faces re–populating our sorely depleted, near empty, southbound thru-hiker numbers. We chat like little children over greasy hot French fries and burgers. Then its time for Frodo and I to drive back in to D.C. In wet shorts and damp shirts—you sweat under a rain jackets--Dot asks if the two of them can come back with us to town. “Of course.” We had originally invited them, but they’d passed.
Thanks to Frodo for braving the traffic on the way back to our daughter Jordie’s Bethesda home. It’s such a disconnect, to hike 16 miles in dripping woods and then end up in a mall buying dinner at a food court and then sleeping in a soft bed. I’ll be back hiking the morning after next, like the postman, whether in rain or snow, in heat or cold or gloom if night, I have my appointed rounds.","Tom Floyd Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576732,"This was a day with no hiking miles, but Scout was quite busy nonetheless.  Jordie had the day off today, since she was on call yesterday and last night.  She’s an anesthesiologist.  Her husband Trevor was our gracious host last night, but he left today at noon on a business trip.
1)  Scout caught up on his trail journal and discovered that when he types it directly onto a computer rather than writing it out on paper – yesterday was no conditions to be trying to write during the day – he actually writes longer entries.   

2)  Scout prepared for and participated in a telephonic meeting about marketing for the coffee table book he has been contracted to write about the Continental Divide Trail.  This will be a “partner” book for the Rizzoli Press books on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail (the latter of which Scout co-authored).  One of the reasons I don’t want Scout to dilly-dally too much as he hikes this trail is because he needs to get to work on the CDT book as soon as possible.  
3)  Scout planned out his next few days on the trail.  Then, with his brain already full of all that information, he spent time with me looking at what’s ahead for the next month.  There’s only so much logistics you can process at a time, so that was a challenge.

4)  Scout put his food for the next several days – until two days after I leave on the 5th – into bags, one bag for each day.  That way I knew what food that I had brought and had bought was excess and could be offered to Dot and Franky.  That was very helpful to me, so I was grateful he spent that time.

Jordie asked her dad this afternoon if he would like to go with her to get a special treat and spoil his appetite.  Of course he jumped at the chance to spend some one-on-one time with her.  They shared this very decadent ice-cream-in-a-curled-waffle-with-sprinkles concoction that has a funny name I’ve forgotten, see the photo above.Sean and Nicky & James joined us for dinner, which was excellent wood-fired pizzas from one of Jordie’s favorite reataurants, appetizers that I had bought, salad that Sean brought, and s’mores.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Jordie has a very nice house with an amazing yard.  We toasted marshmallows over her new fire bowl and had some lovely family time.  We were especially pleased that Nicky and James could join us, as they left from Jordie’s to catch an overnight flight to Milan, Italy.  It’s always stressful packing for an overseas trip so I know they were up late last night so they could spend time with all of us this evening.
Dot & Franky hung out with us, too.  I took them to REI and the supermarket and to a barber so Franky could get his beard trimmed.  (The barber told him, “You don’t need a beard trim, you need a HAIRCUT!”)  I binged some on Game of Thrones and Dot got some napping in.

Altogether, a pretty great off-trail day.","Elkwallow Wayside

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576765,"Angry words
(And a shout out to Washington & Lee University freshmen trekkers) 
Never is heard a discouraging word… Nor an angry word. Out here we are all stressed, stretched thin like silly putty. From wretched weather, to gear failures, aches, pains, to bites, blisters and cuts, or maybe the trail or Mother Nature is smacking us in the face. Any of this could justify swearing, getting angry, shouting at the universe or each other. Doesn’t happen. We take sourest lemon and make more lemonade. 
But four days ago I let loose an angry word. It begins with a “D” and has “n” and ends with a “t.” 
Do you know my trail water system? I have no Nalgene water bottles—those weigh 4 to 6 ounces each. I have a 2-liter Platypus bladder attached to a long water tube with a bite valve. The bladder is shoved top down into a side pocket of my pack, the water tube runs up the side of my pack, loops over my umbrella and clips to a shoulder strap where the bite valve dangles near my chest, ever at the ready for sipping water. I use a Sawyer Squeeze filter attached to a one-liter Smart water bottle and a 20-ounce soda bottle for reserve if I ever need it.
“DON'T!” I shouted and gave a hard push to the body. Me shouting; I never get mad. (Frodo: Well, hardly ever.)  The lady started to cry. 
Last Sunday, at the trailhead when Nicky our daughter and her boyfriend James were being picked up, we’d all dropped our packs and leaned them against a fallen log. A car pulled up, two ladies exited and out bounded their dog. No leash. The tan Labrador retriever raced over and just as the owner indicated “She’s friendly,” the dog lifted its hind leg and peed a long stream right next to my pack—and the yellow water squarely bounced right off my bite valve. That’s my water supply. That’s where I put my lips. “Don’t!” I shouted and I shoved its rear end.
When the owner realized what happened, she started to cry. In the end I ended up comforting her. “It’s okay. These things happen.”  No, I didn’t make much lemonade from this one, and it took me a few days to write about it. I walked off, having borrowed Nicky’s bladder, water tube and bite valve.  Frodo cleaned and sterilized mine yesterday, so I have my own set-up back now.
Today Franky is hopeful again as we start from Elkwallow Wayside. Today will be his day to see a bear. He's never seen a bear in the wild. Shenandoah National Park is rife with bears. We have driven two hours from Bethesda to the trailhead—thanks Frodo—and get a 7:40 start hoping to hike a bit over twenty miles. 
What a change from the day of rain two days ago. We can see and there are views. There are even times I can see the mountain we are going to climb ahead. There’s the Pinnacle peeking out through a gap in the trees. And there’s Stony Man Mountain. I know that sounds like it should be a common occurrence. But don’t underestimate the green tunnel. It was a joy to see what lay ahead. And the trail tread was a testament to the care showered on our National Parks. Climbs were smooth, full of switchbacks. On the approach to Stony Man three times I saw ahead boulder-strewn slope ahead above the trail. I knew what that mean—trail turning to boulders alone, with the occasional white blaze mark so you could find your way amid the jumbled large stones. Nope. Here they had cleared an actual path and the only boulders near my feet were the ones that lined the path. Now that’s a concept. Here's a photo of me on a Stony Man overlook. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
“Bear!”  That happened twice today. First for Dot alone this morning. “He was about the size of a large dog.” No she wasn’t scared. I’d say, fascinated, elated with maybe the smallest swirl of concern. Poor Franky, no bear. But at the end of the day when I saw the two of them, he had bagged his bear, too. He said it was quite small. But it was a BEAR. And he got photos.
I hiked by myself today. But it was two days before the Labor Day holiday weekend and I ran into a few folk who I chatted up. The Washington & Lee freshmen trek crew were particularly uplifting. I ran into them just as I was climbing the Pinnacle. I had to limit myself to fifteen minutes with them. They were so enthusiastic about being out here. Annie said she was going to save the world, or at least her part of the world: Selma, Alabama. They gave me food, but better yet, they gave me hope on so many levels, hope that the next generation of outdoor protectors will be there, hope to see so much optimism in the face of what’s happening in the world, hope to see them looking forward to starting college and to their lives ahead. I gave them AT tattoos—it’s what I had to give.  So, a big shout-out to the W&L Shenandoah North Crew: Andrew, Katherine, Ellie, McLean, Jonathan, Annie, Jon Claire and Rit.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I cleared twenty one miles, hit the parking lot to see my dear Frodo. We are staying at a classic almost 80-year-old National Park lodge tonight. (Frodo: my husband is very good to me.  I'm sure he would just as soon sleep in a shelter.)  Tomorrow she’ll make the short drive back to Hawksbill Gap where she will drop me off early and I’ll hear her say once again, “Make wise decisions.”","Elkwallow Wayside

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576800,"One reason you go on a long hike is because you value seclusion.  I’ve had plenty of time in The Green Tunnel alone.  So, would you have planned to traverse one of America’s most popular National Parks on a big holiday weekend?
It’s Friday of Labor Day Weekend.  Campgrounds are filling up.  My god, what have we gotten ourselves into?

I set out early, 6:40 am, not long after there’s barely enough light to hike.  What will it be like a month from now, or when I’m hiking deep into October?  How much daylight will I have left?

I have 23 miles planned.  The weather is supposed to be rotten tomorrow with rain all day.  But today should just be overcast, with a much lower chance of rain.

Franky is hiking well ahead, but I take a break 5 miles along as the trail goes by Big Meadows Lodge, and I join Frodo and Dot for a very nice breakfast.  Then Dot and I hike together for 7 miles before lunch.

BEAR!  Dot’s pointing like a bird dog.  She’d heard a twig snap.  There’s the black form, the unmistakable ears and face.  She and Franky saw two bears yesterday and now it was finally my turn after 1,270 AT miles.  Forty feet away, grubbing for food to put on some winter fat.  Bless him, he even gave me time to shoot a video. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
I told Dot, “You’re the Bear Whisperer.”

BEAR!  This time I was the bird dog pointing.  Straight ahead.  Jet black.  He froze on the trail and then scampered off.  He bounded more like a deer than a bear.  
I have a question for you.  Here I am in lush country, dense and leafy growth that must be abundant with grubs and berries.  Bears here should grow to enormous size.  In California’s Sierra Nevada, spare country with a short growing season, I’ve seen male bears easily topping 500 pounds, VW-bug-size bears that might take on a tank.  But the bears here, why, they’re small, barely the size of a large dog.  And they look like a small gang of koalas would give them a good fight.

So why?

Soon after we sighted the two bears, not even 11:00 am, it started to rain.  My umbrella unfurled, we both put on pack covers and Dot donned her rain jacket.  It’s a whole different dynamic from 10 or 20 years ago.  Out on a trek of a week or more, we learned to read the sky.  We closely watched portents, hints of rain in the offing.  Today on the AT, hikers access Doppler radar websites, look ahead to the weather hour-by-hour, not just for this day but even for days ahead.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... The predictions change, sometimes swinging wildly, and I’ve seen it drive some folks crazy.  
Why mention it now?  Because it rained all day.  That’s just the way it is.  I’ve seen hikers spend an extra half day or full day in a shelter or in town because rain is predicted.  Playing the weather game.  Sometimes they’ve missed out on good hiking conditions.  It’s different and at times odd to have so much weather info if you want it.

The park may be filling with campers, but the rain is keeping them off the trails.  I had a pretty solitary day except for Dot. But I did see Janine from Germany again, with her Boyfriend Mark.  If you recall, Janine abandoned her SOBO thru-hike, mostly due to loneliness.  Her boyfriend Mark joined her and they're now doing sightseeing in a car and cherry-picking some of the prettiest areas to hike.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
They say rain all day tomorrow.  I’ll be out hiking, regardless, and I’ll give you a full report.","Hawksbill Gap

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576885,"Nine degrees Celsius was the temperature reading in the rental car (Frodo: I can’t figure out how to switch it to Fahrenheit) when Frodo charged me, “Make wise decisions” and I walked into the rain.  (Frodo: I’m starting to be a little superstitious about this.  What if I forget to tell him this sometime when we part at a trailhead or sign off on the phone?  If something bad happened to him, I would feel like it was my fault.  Yesterday I think I forgot to say it when we parted early in the morning, so I was glad to see him unharmed when Dot and I induced him to stop for breakfast [my text: I can order for you – hot chocolate and pecan waffle?] and glad I had another opportunity to send him off properly admonished.)
That’s 48 degrees Fahrenheit.  I don’t think we’ve seen temperatures that low for six weeks or more.  Here at over 3,000 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Shenandoah National Park, it was more frigid than it was last night at Mt. Katahdin’s doorstep: Millinockett, Maine.  Instead of sweltering in a tent in skivvies until 10 pm, Franky says that last night he slept uncomfortably cold.  So today he bought a pair of Shenandoah sweatpants to take on the trail.  (Frodo:  They look quite heavy, so he must have been REALLY cold!)  Next week he will get back his 30-degree sleeping bag.  I’m going to switch back to my warmer bag in two weeks.

Where is everybody?  It’s the Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  I walk all morning, ten miles, and see four people in what should be a holiday-crowded national park.  Rain.  Cold.

Two miles after I start I meet two gals in Hightop Shelter, northbound AT section hikers Bear Bell and Caw.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... We talk for 15 minutes; it could have been a lot more.  Dot & Franky shared the shelter with them last night.  Franky lit a fire yesterday late afternoon, the first he’s lit on the trail.  He was a hero, because it was cold.

Right after lunch I meet a bedraggled backpacking couple.  Wet.  Two straight days of rain can do that.  I silently thank my umbrella once again.

Do the bears still scrounge for grubs on a rainy day?  The deer still forage.  If I were a bear I’d hang out in my cozy den on a day like today.  
We could have had at least ten stellar views today.  Well-traveled short side trails lead to rocky ledges on Hilltop Mountain, Weaver Mountain, overlooking Ivy Creek, and Loft Mountain.  If you like various shades of gray, there were views for you.  We have trod 80 miles in the park – 4 days, 3 of which were socked in and rain soaked.  But tomorrow all reports call for good weather for our last full day in Shenandoah National Park.  
In addition to good weather, tomorrow will also bring me a new trail companion – Not-A-Moose!  She thru-hiked the PCT in ’07, much of northern California and Washington around and with us.  Then when I hiked the CDT in ’15 she came out and hiked with me for about a week in northwest Wyoming.  And, as she recently wrote, “What’s a Scout long-distance hike without Not-A-Moose?”  This strong-hiking young woman will hike with me for 7 days.  Dot’s happy there will be another hiking woman around.

Looking forward to seeing that bright yellow orb in the sky tomorrow.","Hightop Mountain Overlook, Skyline Drive

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577118,"Today was the kind of day it’s wonderful to be a backpacker.  Starting out at sunrise I have the trail to myself.  The last two days of rain have left glistening jewels studding leaves under today’s bright sun.  For the first hour and a half I have the trail to myself, views of dark-green Shenandoah-like paintings competing and crying, “Take out your camera for me!”  (Frodo: In spite of his sentence construction claiming that he was looking at paintings, he was actually looking at the real thing – the Shenandoah Valley and banks of Blue Ridge Mountains.)
And just like the views have come out, the people have, too.  In droves – day hikers, backpackers – I feel like I’m in an amusement park and I’m the park host.  Welcome!  I’m glad you’re here.  Brian, age 12, lights up when I pass him one of my custom gold AT tattoos.  His dad prompts him to say thank-you, but that glow from his eyes and upturn at the corners of his mouth are all the thanks I need. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   I feel like Mickey Mouse in my own Disneyland. Some I tell I hiked from Maine, some not.  The trailhead parking lots are full, while yesterday they were deserted.  The forest seems to sparkle in the filtered sunlight.  
Lunch provides no break in my hosting, as I choose a patch of sunlight near the trail.  Two young women backpackers engage in conversation with me and then, as they come over at the offer of my small AT token, I say, “Isn’t there some warning somewhere about young girls accepting gifts from an old man in the woods?”  All three of us laugh.

This feels like the perfect day.  
It’s now 2:30, 17 miles done and I’m waiting at a trailhead for Frodo to show up with a new hiking companion, Not-A-Moose.  I lie on my groundsheet on a grassy patch alongside Skyline Drive.  Two cars with hikers I met today happen to drive by.  Windows come down, they call out “Scout!” as they pass.  A guy on a bicycle does the same.

Can you imagine if each of us had our own small token we gave out when meeting each other, out in the regular world?  Something chosen to prompt a smile.  What a world that would be.

I am at Calf Mountain Shelter and now this is what I thought a Labor Day Weekend night would be like.  One group has put a red-and-white-checked tablecloth on the picnic table, they’re cooking steaks on the fire, have songs playing from a canister speaker, and are cooking hot dogs…. THAT THEY FEED TO THEIR DOG!  But the music is from the 70s, there are ten more camping here, and from the animated talk the wine must have been flowing for a while.

And Frodo is here to share it with me.  She hiked in a bit over 2 miles and tonight she will sleep inside an AT shelter for the first time.

I know up ahead, as Fall arrives and more darkness than light overruns me before I can finish this trail, there will be rough days.  But I will cling to memories of this one, cleave to it like I do to memories of Frodo’s hugs.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","Doyle's River Trailhead

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577230,"I am uncomfortable.  Very.  I am always that way when I am behind in my journal.  I should have finished this entry last night, but I am just now starting.  It’s sunrise, 6:50 am.  I must start walking soon.
But Buck is back.  Buck!  He was here last night, back from the trail dead. 
(Frodo:  Okay, this entry is dated September 4, which was Monday and Labor Day.  He actually wrote it on Tuesday morning and for almost the entire entry he refers to Monday as “yesterday” and “last night”, which is confusing to me, at least.  So I’m going to take the liberty of transcribing it as though it had been written on Monday.)

This evening Frodo picked up Not-A-Moose (hereinafter “NAM”) and me at a trailhead and we drove a few miles to a well-known trail destination, the Devil’s Backbone Brewery.  They have extensive grounds and they let AT hikers camp tucked away around a clearing in the forest.  And they have a great restaurant and are very accommodating.  Buck!  Of course Frodo and I stayed up with him around a rare AT campfire to catch up with each other.  So I didn’t write in my journal right after dinner, as I often do.

But what about writing it afterward, in the tent, Scout?  Frodo is leaving tomorrow morning and this is our last night together for almost 4 weeks.  (Frodo: ‘Nuff said!) (Frodo again:But Scout continues….)  My only chore is to brush my teeth well (Princess alert!)… so Frodo will want to kiss me.  (Here the Princesses think, “yuuucck” and little Jessica says, “Write the journal, Scout.  And mention us.”)

I am also uncomfortable because of the only fall I’ve taken in weeks.  It was three days ago in the rain and it left a pain deep in my lower left butt cheek.  (Don’t laugh, Jessica.)  And it’s hard to keep my weight off it.  The injury hasn’t really rounded up yet, taking its sweet time getting worse before getting better.  I was actually a bit short with Frodo a couple of times today.  Pain will do that. 
But I’m getting ahead of myself.  Soon after we left the shelter this morning, we climbed Calf Mountain and at the top we had something important to do.  A good Temple friend had asked me to say Kaddish for her brother.  In his last years, Martin had hiked often along the AT in and near Shenandoah National Park.  He lived in nearby Charlottesville.  His ashes were spread up here in the mountains and woods he loved.  “You’re way closer than I’ll ever be,” wrote my friend Judith.  On top of Calf Mountain Frodo and I recited the Jewish Prayer of Remembrance.

After saying a temporary good-bye to Frodo at the nearby trailhead, NAM and I walked on, in only a few miles hiking out of Shenandoah National Park.  Lovely trails, 3 days of sun, 3 days of rain, some Labor Day crowds.

I’m not going to mention my “shorts failure” of this morning, but I expect Frodo is not going to let it pass.  (Frodo:  You know, I could refrain from saying anything and just leave everyone wondering…..  But, no, not when we have a photo!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Just as we were about to leave the shelter and start hiking, I noticed that Scout’s shorts looked uncomfortably bunched up.  He’d put them on inside out!  Okay, ‘nuff said)

Immediately outside the park we spied the orange roof of a failed Howard Johnsons, in a generally derelict area – with a gourmet popcorn and hot dog food truck!  Frodo was waiting for us there.  I, at least, ate like a thru-hiker.  Above you can see NAM with her chili cheese fries.

Frodo slept with me (Frodo:  Ahem.  ALONGSIDE you.) actually inside an AT shelter last night.  I think she enjoyed it.  There were six of us total inside the shelter, including newlyweds Pencil Pusher and Italian Ice.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The trail is still nice, but not quite National Park nice, and NAM is getting her trail legs under her as she hikes 18 miles and I hike 22.  We are setting up to summit “The Priest” late tomorrow, with a 3,100-foot elevation gain.  That’s my biggest since the Presidentials back in New Hampshire.  I hope Not-A-Moose is up for the challenge.

Be forewarned – it’s my last night with Frodo until she joins me October 1, so you may start seeing “IMF” again.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577278,"Just imagine all the things that can go wrong.  We have plenty of time to think out here.  If you were going to imagine such things you could have a field day, thinking of all the ways you could get hurt.  Such as, what if I were eating a Little Debbie apple tart.  And what if a bee landed on that sweet apple filling.  And what if I took a bite right then.  Nah, that’s dumb.  Never happen.
“Little Debbie” pastries and cakes are a traditional AT trail food.  The outside of the package brags, ‘Natural and Artificial Flavors.”  Love those artificial flavors.

OUCH!  My hand darts to my mouth.  I pull out a bee!!  It hurts like the dickens, like two dentists just hit the tip of my tongue with hot needles.  I next pull out the stinger.  Did that little bugger just make my tongue swell?  The right half of my tongue is twice its usual size an hour later.  What fun!  Here’s a photo:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We have two big climbs today; nearly 5,000 feet elevation gain before we lay down our heads tonight. Here's NAM tanking up:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
All morning it looks like rain must be days away as we climb Three Ridge Mountain.  But you can’t fool us; we know that rain is on the way.

It’s due to start around 3:00.  With 7 miles left and all the climb up The Priest ahead, a thunderstorm roars in, more like this is Maine and not Virginia.  Big wind gusts signaled that we had two minutes to cover our packs, unfurl our umbrellas, and button down the latches.  Lots of lightning fireworks.  One made us jump – light and crash at the same time.

Ascending The Priest gave me a lot of time to think about the AT tradition here – confess your “trail sins” on the shelter register.  I’m still thinking about what to write.
(Frodo: Sorry to interject, but there are two photos from last night at the brewery that Scout gave me to post, too late to be included in yesterday's entry.  Here they are:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577340,"“I’ll see you soon,” I said to Not-A-Moose as she left The Priest Shelter, heading off into the rain.  We should have talked more.  No discussion of where to meet up, say, in case it rained all day.
At The Priest Shelter hikers make their trail confessions.  Indeed, so many entries begin, “Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned…”

I’ve thought about The Priest register on and off for weeks.  What would I write?  Why does it feel more then odd, but wrong?  Confessing your sins is good for you, right?  In the end, here’s what I wrote early this morning.  (This will also be an exercise in deciphering my handwriting.  You can see what Frodo has to deal with every day.)  (Frodo: He told me that he really tried to write legibly, so what I normally get is quite a bit worse.)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It rains and it rains.  We stay near the 4,000-foot level, going down a few hundred feet and then back up. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... The trail’s pretty good, but when will I see NAM?  I go in to the next shelter after 6.6 miles.  No NAM.  She didn’t stop in.  In the rain you want to keep on walking.  We are aiming for U.S. Highway 60 where we’ll go off trail for a zero day in town.  Is she going to hike there without really stopping?  The shelter was the obvious meet-up point.  The next shelter is 10 more miles along, only 4 miles from the road, and a half mile off the trail.  Will I not know where she is until after 10 hours of hiking, when I hit the road?  I’m not worrying hard, but I’m concerned.

At the shelter this morning a hiker is sitting out the day of rain. I met Turtle Trax back in Maine.  He was heading north to Katahdin, having started at Harper’s Ferry.  Sean was with me.  It was a day after Mahoosuc Notch.  Eons ago.  Now he’d flipped back south, starting again at Harper’s Ferry to hike to Georgia.  And he was cold.  The weather has turned.  A week ago he would have been warm with what he had.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I have an old mountain folk tune running through my head.  “It rained all night, and it rained all day, singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day.”  What I want to know is, if it’s raining day and night, who the heck wants to sing Polly Wolly Doodle anything?  (Frodo: I’m not sure if he learned weird lyrics to that, or if he just made these up, but I’ve never heard that version of the song.)

“Scout!”  I am 10 miles along.  No NAM.  And then from 75 feet of the trail, under a large rock overhang, I hear that cry.  I see her pump her umbrella up and down.  I am very relieved.  We are both gleeful to see each other.  We’ve learned a lesson, too.  We both may be accomplished hikers, but we can’t be casual about meeting up.  
We both cram more food in our pockets.  No dry place for any lunch.  Walk on.

Apples.  Apples on the ground.  Apples up in the air.  No, it’s not trail magic, but up here on a high ridge are the remnants of an apple orchard.  We each have two.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Up a bit.  Down a bit.  Eight miles left.  Then six.  Then four.  How many times were we teased by a few minutes of no rain, into thinking, “It’s stopping.”  No.  Fooled you.

But umbrellas keep our shirts and shorts largely dry.  Trailside brush scours our legs, re-wetting them often.

I am able by phone to reach a hostel that runs a shuttle from highway 60.  The name of the highway makes it sound big, but when we get there the road is largely an empty two-lane with a big truck roaring by every few minutes, but not much more than that.  And who in their right mind would pick up two hikers that look like damp dogs with silver umbrellas?

I write this after having showered and eaten – I barely won the battle with a cheese steak sandwich and garlic bread.  We are in Stanimal’s Hostel in teensy Glasgow.  Happy and looking forward to a zero after 140 miles in 7 days.","The Priest Shelter

Irma.  She may visit me in dark of night.  In my tent.  Or in a shelter.  Sorry, Frodo, but Irma won’t take no for an answer.

What gives?  Read this Guestbook entry from William (Thanks, William, and thanks to all who send me notes.)  
 “Scout, don't tell Frodo, but there is a lady who may be planning to pay you a visit in about a week (Tues-Wed the 12-13th of September). Her name is Irma and she may be in a foul mood. Suggest you keep an eye peeled on the forecast track by Sat-Sun since that will be the first time that her Tue-Wed position/track can be well bracketed.  Tropical weather systems are typically much weakened by the time they reach the Blue Ridge Mountains, but not always.  In 1989 Hurricane Hugo still packed 80-90 mph winds and wreaked havoc in the Mount Rogers area with hundreds of thousands of trees blown down.  In 1972 Hurricane Camille dropped 30"" of rain around Buena Vista on the west side of the AT and in Nelson County just SOBO of Rockfish Gap on the east side of the AT, with predictable catastrophic flooding. Be thinking about a ""hunker down"" plan well away from rising water and falling trees!”

William’s should have had a title:  WARNING!
We had a lazy day here at the hostel.  Sure there was laundry, trips to two stores for food resupply, phone calls and email.  I made grilled cheese sandwiches for the two of us since we have a kitchen, slicing slivers of green pepper to put inside.  Part o the cheese I used was a cheddar-jack stick I carried for 100 miles.  Not-A-Moose made a salad from the only two vegetables at the Glasgow store - iceberg lettuce and that green pepper.
Lazy.  there's a concept.  Do I remember how to do it?  NAM has it down pat, as you can see above.
""Danger, Will Robinson!  Danger!""  Everyone wants to warn me about That Woman.  Even my mother today.  Don Owen warned me about her older sister, ""We were out in an AT shelter during Katrina.""  He described the view from the shelter's mouth, trees whipping and then snapping like matchsticks.  It was like viewing a disaster movie with 3-D glasses with Surround Sound on a Jumbo-tron screen 5 feet from your nose.  ""We all slept on the bottom bunks for the most protection.""  The next day they abandoned their AT hike, beating a retreat on a 5-mile side trail.  Nine hours; there were that many downed trees.
Switching to the mundane.  I did something for the first time today.  I'd never been inside a Dollar General store before.  (Frodo: They're not in San Diego.)  You can resupply pretty darn well in one.  Here I am, no longer a Dollar General Store virgin.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Maybe a week ago Dot said, ""It doesn't rain much here in September and October.""  Hmmm...  I'm waiting.  But the next our days before Irma look pretty nice.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577444,"“You have a nice section of trail ahead of you,” said Bob, our hostel shuttle driver as he dropped us off.  The weather is crisp, sky clear, all foresaging a perfect hiking-temperature day.  Are we being lulled?  Is Mother Nature a pool shark daring us to double down? (Frodo: Umm… I don’t think foresaging is a real word…)
Less than two miles along we stop at the first shelter, Brown Mountain Creek.  Pippi, a section hiker as bouncy and bright as the day, as happy as her full-page entry in the register complete with sunny illustrations.  There was another guy there, a flip-flopper who will end his hike soon at 2000 miles.  He was glum and not talking.  I wonder how it was for the two of them, sharing a shelter last night.  (Frodo:  So now we’re curious.  Is he stopping by choice?  Does he have to go back to school or work?  Is he injured?  Having a miserable time?  If he wasn’t talking, how did you know he flip-flopped and is going to stop?  You’re leaving us hangin’ here!)

“BEAR!”  I missed it, but Not-A-Moose has bagged hers.  I had stopped to pee.  Dang.  But not long after I saw her jump and come to a sudden halt.  Black snake.  Harmless, but five feet long. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
In the cove formed by Bear Mountain Creek two Forest Service signs told us of a freed slave sharecropper community.  “The hills and hollows of the Appalachian Trail hold many secrets.”  If you had your own horse team the landlord got one-quarter of your crops.  If the landlord supplied the team, you surrendered half.  One half!  One sign said the community was abandoned.  Interestingly, the other said that the land was sold to the Forest Service.  The 1920s were a booming economic time.  I have to wonder if they were forced out to make the National Forest.

Just before lunch at a road crossing we came across the strangest dog.  He seemed abandoned, wanted to latch onto and follow us, hound-dog sized.  He had not one, but two radio collars, and big initials were bleached white into his sides, like a billboard.  I’d never seen anything like it and neither had NAM.

A local couple starting on a day hike set us straight.  “That’s a bear dog.”  Hunters set a pack of them loose in the morning and then track them digitally.  (I still don’t get it.  Why?  Can they tell when the dog finds a bear that way?  Man, you are being so cryptic today!)

High on Bluff Mountain we came across two handlers with six dogs on a chain.  This is their training season. They are out without guns training the dogs to tree a bear.  Does anyone tell the bears that it’s only training?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We saw our first lake in what seems ages.  It was dammed, so it was man-made, but it was the first one in forever. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At Bluff Mountain Peak where NAM and I posed for the photo above, there was a sobering plaque nearby.  Far down below, in fall of 1891, a teacher sent her young students out to gather firewood for the wood stove.  One never returned.  Ottie Cline Powell was 4 years and 11 months old.  In spring his body was found here at the summit, a 7-mile climb from the schoolhouse.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The last 8 miles before tonight’s shelter were unusual.  Not just for the many views.  They were waterless.  An 8-mile stretch on the AT with no water is rare indeed.

",Johns Hollow Shelter,"Sep 08, Fri",20.10
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577534,"Let’s get the mundane out of the way, because Not-A-Moose asked me, “Why do you do this?  Have you thought of quitting?”
We left Johns Hollow Shelter around 7:30, both of us pushing our arms close to our sides.  “Brrr, it’s actually cold!”  My 40-degree bag still keeps me toasty, but I can tell its days are numbered.  After a drop was a trail icon – the James River footbridge.  At 700 feet in length, it’s the longest footbridge on the AT.  At one time, some hikers jumped off it.  Now there are signs warning of big fines, aside from the fact that it’s dangerous.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the James River we were at less than 1,000 feet elevation and we knew we would have three climbs today; even with the descents in between we’d end the day at just a hair’s breadth under 4,000 feet.  For weeks, late July and all of August, we never topped 2,000 feet.  Now The Priest and these highlands have put us on top of the world again.

Two more parts of the mundane before answering NAM’s question.  Views today – a lot, some really stunning.  Water – sources are not reliable.  The two springs at 1415.7 and 1416.3 were supposed to be our source for the Thunder Hill Shelter 3 miles beyond.  The second was “abundant”.  Not.  It was there, but barely, maybe a 2-inch-deep pool, not even bicycle-tire-sized.  But the shelter’s “poor water source” (so said the guidebook) was a half-foot-deep rock-lined pool.  Go figure.

Why do I do this?  Do I think about quitting?  On the PCT I never once thought of quitting.  I never thought of my bed at home.  (Frodo: Man, I sure did!  We have a great waterbed!)  On the CDT I had some down moments, at mile 800 in Glacier on a miserable snowy and rainy day, toward the end in Colorado on hostile, high trail.  But it was never a serious option for me.  I hike because around every curve, at any moment, something amazing may transpire – even if it’s being stung on the tongue by a bee.  That “possibility” seems incredibly more likely here than in the city.  Ten years have passed since our PCT hike and I can tell you a story for every day.  No, multiple stories.  I hike among amazing people, good people, most of whom I’d never have met.  I write out here more consistently than almost anywhere else.  Which brings me to today’s small miracle.

“Joel, step back.”  We are at the Thunder Ridge Overlook.  Four dayhikers have just come up from their cars for the spectacular view.  You step up to a low rock wall that’s all between you and a sheer cliff drop-off.  Joel’s a bit north of my vintage and Connie, his wife of twenty years, didn’t like how he was leaning over the edge.  (Frodo: For what it’s worth, I totally know how Connie feels.)  “Joel,” she implored.  She wasn’t going to step near that wall.  She kept at least two arm’s lengths away.  They were there with their adult grandson (also Joel) and his wife.  We exchanged stories, they were interested in my thru-hike, all reliably ordinary, till these next twists.

“You know, it’s funny.  She’s afraid of heights.”  Joel said, “Connie used to be a wing walker.”  A what?  Connie gave a half smile, but didn’t come any nearer to the cliff edge.  “She’d stand on wings.”  Joel told how she once knelt on the wing of a Stearman Biplane while it did two full circle loops through the St. Louis Arch.  “We were called the Daring Damsels.” http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   and   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
But that was just the start.  They have a cabin on the PCT just south of Ashland, Oregon.  I probably walked by it 10 years ago, and I plan to do a hike late next July that will take me by there again.  And Joel is an Ashland oral surgeon.  If you know our PCT stories you might know where this is heading.  Ten years ago, well over three months into our PCT hike, Frodo fell, breaking off half of one front tooth and mostly knocking out a second.  She shoved that one back into the socket.  Those two teeth should have been goners.  But the heroic – at least in our eyes – efforts of an Ashland dentist on a Sunday night saved them both.  Joel knows Dr. David Laver well.  (Here’s that story: http://www.trailjournals.com/j... )

Special connections, special moments like that just seem to happen on the trail.  Here’s Joel, Connie the Daring Damsel, their grandson Joel and his wife Lindsey. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... I hope to see them next July.

Finally, at the shelter tonight I lit my first fire on the AT.  My Boy Scout skills aren’t that rusty.  Here’s proof: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It’s Not-A-Moose’s last night on the AT.  At 9:30 tomorrow at a trailhead, Bob from Stanimal’s hostel will pick her up, and drop off my next days’ resupply.  NAM zipped up her 20-degree sleeping bag for the first time in six nights – it’s getting colder.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577567,"It was Not-A-Moose’s last morning out here with  me, but before she left we had to pass through “The Guillotine.”  Ominous.  Was it like the “Lemon Squeezer,” Agony Grind,” or “Roller Coaster”?  Here’s the photo; you judge.
NAM has been great company.  It will feel odd hiking by myself again.  Safe travels back to Calgary.

As recompense for the loss, I met some of the nicest people this morning.  I greeted the first, an older couple, with, “It’s so nice to hear happy chatter.”  “We were bickering,” Mystic said, nodding toward her husband and smiling.  “How long have you been at it?”  I asked, willing to bet this backpacking couple had been together for decades, not just years.  “We’ve been bickering three months,” Mystic responded. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... How could I not stop and talk for 10 minutes, even though the day demanded I be efficient to make town, Daleville, tomorrow.  
And then Cookie Monster and Private Benjamin were really my downfall.  They were so lively, happy, about to fill in a section that would give them a good portion of the trail.  And they’d seen me on Trailjournals!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... Another 15 minutes down.  I wouldn’t change it for the world, but the 23 miles I wanted to cover today is looking less likely.  And skipping lunch would violate the Prime Directive – Frodo’s “Make Wise Decisions.”

I wear my warm beanie all day.  It got well into the low 40s last night.  My feet were cold.  It’s time for my warmer sleeping bag and time to get back my down puffy jacket.  Sleeping cold was no fun.

The trail remains good.  I heard bear hounds yelping in the distance.  After dropping from 4,000 feet to 950 feet, there were some long uphills, but they weren’t that bad.  There were some good views, too, such as this one: (Frodo:  Umm.. you didn't send me a view photo for today, but here's a pretty flower)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At 7:17, with the sun setting, it was time to observe Frodo’s credo, find a campsite, set up my tent, eat, then work on these pages.  In the end I hiked 20.5 miles today, leaving 21.7 for tomorrow.  I hope to get in to Daleville before Irma’s rain starts falling.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577656,"“Why don’t they cut the trees?”  How many times have I thought that on a summit that might provide an amazing view?  Not dozens, but scores, maybe hundreds of times.  The trail is snaking this morning.  No, not so much up and down like the roller coaster, but like a sidewinder.  It’s trying to stay close to another twisty pal.  The trail cleaves to Virginia’s Blue Ridge Parkway as if they were kissing cousins at a Sunday picnic.  Every few miles we cross the road, often at a “scenic overlook.”  And at times the trail cuts just below one.
This morning I found myself asking, “Why am I walking through an area that’s pretty clear? No evidence of a fire, no power line or buried pipeline.  At the second or third instance, it finally penetrated my thick head.

“Why don’t they cut the trees?”  So many peaks were thick with tree trunks blocking the views.  Just cut a few to give us a glimpse.  Here on the Blue Ridge Parkway they’ve cut whole 100-yard-wide swaths.  Why don’t they cut the trees?  Here they did.

I am seven miles along as I write this and I need to get back up soon.  A hazy sun in thick overcast (Frodo: Aren’t those mutually exclusive?) is dimming.  The wind is picking up.  I race the wind.  I race the rain.  Will I beat Irma into Daleville, 14 miles away?

I hear a bird and I think of Not-A-Moose.  For months I thought a particular chattering noise was birds.  “It’s chipmunks.”  She set me straight.  And I’ll now always remember that Barred Owls make a noise that sounds like, “Who cooks for you?  Who cooks for you?”  NAM, I hope your travels back were easy and I’m so glad you came.

I’ve been thinking that in my journal I’ve been describing the trail less and less.  Well, it hasn’t slapped me around for a good while.  Some days the climbs and descents are fewer, some days the views more, and largely it’s been pretty good.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   And think about where we SOBOs started – Katahdin, the 100-mile Wilderness, the Presidentials and Whites.  These contained some of the most startlingly tough sections to use the name trail.  In the youth of our hike, our tents were touched by fire.  (Frodo: Hmmm… I think you mean this figuratively, but it was more your bodies than your tents that struggled for the first weeks.)

I don’t lunch until 1:30.  But at that time yesterday I had only 9.6 miles under my belt.  Today I have over 14.  14!  And when I hit four miles left the rest is all downhill.  I can see Daleville and its neighbor Troutville.  (Does that make anyone else think of the children’s book Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, that had Popperville and Bopperville and Copperville?)

I actually have cell service on the way down and call my brother, parents, two cousins.  How civilized.

And as I register at the HoJos at 6:00 pm, the first drops fall.

I only saw one other person on trail today (Frodo: THAT’S why you made such good time!)  No wing walkers.

A shower, town food, call Frodo and sleep on a bed.  Sleep on a bed.  Tomorrow a zero.

It’s all good.","Bearwallow Gap

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577678,"I got to hear from Rolling Thunder, my original AT hiking partner, in an unusual and close way.  This close tie revolves around 11 years ago, the year that Rolling Thunder (RT) was the second-ever starting PCT hiker to stay with us.  Now, well over 3,000 have.  In 2006, RT thru-hiked the PCT and for a good third of the trail he hiked with Three Gallon (TG).  He had a front-row seat as TG fell head-over-heels for Cucumber Boy (Q), a delightful young Russian gal.  They were married four years later and the ceremony officiants were none other than Frodo and I.
At 1:30 today a blue Saturn pulled up outside HoJos room 105.  Out stepped TG and Q.  We spent the afternoon together.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   They are meeting Rolling Thunder next Monday or Tuesday, and they already have a resupply box for him that they actually had with them today.  I wrote a note on the resupply box and gave them a bunch of AT tattoos to give RT.  I also gave TG, Q, and their son Sasha an extra hug to pass on to RT.

You have heard from me often about rocks.  From the open steep granite slopes of Maine that they call trail, to giant boulder fields that became “trail” by virtue of having white blazes painted on them, to Rocksylvania, and most recently the Guillotine.  But you haven’t heard from me about the random painted rocks that dot the trail once every few days.  The photo above shows one.  I am supposed to shoot a photo of it, carry it along, and then find another spot to put it.  I wonder whose idea this was.  Is it one person who keeps it up, or many?

It rained on and off all day.  Irma only swiped at us with the back of her hand, but it was good to be indoors.  And dare I say it? – Tomorrow is supposed to be mostly sunny.  And warmer.  It’s five more days till I get my warmer sleeping bag again.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577885,"At 7:30 am I am walking out the motel room door, headed for the nearby trailhead, and I’m thinking about relationships.  Frodo is on her way to Denmark for a week and now not just the bulk of a continent will separate us, but an entire ocean and part of a continent.  And last week, the night before parting, I nearly spoiled it, I finished my day of hiking behaving badly. 
This morning my right low back and butt cheek is at a simmer, tolerable, ignorable.  But that evening a week ago, it had been at a boil.  “Think about me; obsess about me!”  The pain was an obnoxious, whiny 5-year-old.  I acted annoyed when Frodo asked me questions, unappreciative when she tried to help.  Withdrawing.  I was heading on a collision course to spoil our last night together.

I reached deep and stuck a stick in the spokes of the careening bicycle that was me.  “San,” I said, (Frodo: my real name’s Sandy, by the way) “I’m really hurting and have been most of the day.  I don’t want to act like this.”  I was saying, “help” and “I know I’m being a jerk.”  And with it out in the open, we could both work on righting the ship.  And that, together with generous wine at dinner, led to a fine last night together.  But another young couple I know have dug themselves a pit.  That’s why I was thinking about relationships.  I hope they can dig their way out.

Is this the AT?  On one half-mile stretch, Tinker Cliffs, there are more viewpoints than there usually are in a week.  And before that there are views at Hay Rock.  And after Tinker Cliffs, later in the day will come the best view in all of Virginia, that calendar pin-up photo spot: McAfee Knob.  
The day clears up like it does only after a hard rain.  There are enough clouds for character but no more.  And there are not one, but three different overhanging rocks; the house-size slabs would provide dry space in a storm enough to protect a school classroom.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
There were more milestones today.  We hit the two-thirds-done mark, and the ink ran out in my third pen since the start.

Though I hiked alone the 12 miles to McAfee Knob, I met some great folks.  Four first-time young backpackers were at my mid-day lunch shelter.  They had most everything they carried hanging on a line drying out from yesterday’s storm, but they were all smiles and had a warm fire going.

Not long after that I ran into a couple from the opposite end of the age spectrum, out on a day hike to Tinker Cliffs.  Dale was so charged up about the AT tattoo, he put it on right then and there, on his forearm, and said excitedly, “I can’t wait till they see this in church.”  Here are Dale and Sharon. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Finally, I had been worried about how I’d get a photo of myself on McAfee Knob if no one was there.  I was going to tie together a Rube-Goldberg tripod and put my camera on 10-second delay.  But Anthony, Nickki, and Skyler were there and so patient taking photos with my smart phone. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... (Princesses: Don't try this until you're at least 21 years old.  Isn't that the age when your dad will let you start dating?)  The three of them have never backpacked and had hoped to meet a thru-hiker.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  We hiked the next two miles together, chatting – one’s an artist, two are in college.  I even sang “The Scotsman” for them and they joined in on the booming chorus.","Daleville

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577938,"There are names I look for in every register.  Moose, Scrunchy, Cuckoo, Nature Boy, Tree Beard, folks I hiked with for a while, but have sped ahead.  That list used to include Ethan “Stringbean” who hiked with Sean and me for a while in northern New Hampshire.  For weeks I saw Ethan’s name in registers – 3, 6, 10 days ahead.  But then his name disappeared.  I figured he was off trail and I stopped looking for his name.
“Scout!”  I was five miles along, filtering water.  Water’s grown scarcer.  I know that face.  He’d gotten off the trail because he had a staph infection in his foot.

For the remainder of the morning, all the way up to Dragon Tooth, a climb with sections that transported us back to steep Maine, we chatted.  We exchanged all the best stories we’d accumulated over the two months since we’d seen each other.  He had been stalked by a baby skunk.  Not just for a hundred yards, but for two miles.  He thought he’d lost it, but then it would show up again.

We had lunch together at Dragon’s Tooth http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and then Ethan took off.  He’ll probably cover 5 more miles than I today.  We may not see each other again.  But I’ll look for his name again in the registers.

Yesterday and today the trail has been harder.  More rocky areas, more climbs and longer ones. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I’ve had to adjust downward the number of miles I’m doing, even though both days I’ve hiked till dusk.  The difference isn’t huge, just under 20 miles instead of just over, but cumulatively it has me worried about reaching Pearisburg on time this Sunday.  
Imposter!  A name I didn’t expect to see in a shelter register was there this morning.  Rolling Thunder.  He’s some days behind me.  We hiked the first two weeks together.  But my Rolling Thunder joshingly refers to himself as a heathen and this one prominently splashed “God Bless” in his entry.  I sent the image to my RT who replied, “Imposter!”  
At Dragon Tooth I actually met the Bible-spouting clone.  It turns out this Rolling Thunder was named after an Ecclesiastes quote, while my Rolling Thunder was named … after certain body noises emanated from his nether regions.

And just to complete today’s Old Home Week crammed into a single day, at Dragons Tooth five slackpackers showed up – none other than Dot, Franky, Buck, Aloha, and Funky Duck.  That made making my miles harder, too, as I took a good half hour longer for lunch so we could catch up on each other’s news.  Franky has seen the light – he’s now carrying an umbrella, too-bright red.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577960,"I wanted to be efficient today.  Up early, moving out smartly, and I doubted more of my SOBO peeps would arrive and cause me to take a 2-hour lunch today, as I did yesterday.  But when I reached War Spur Shelter at dusk, 7:40 pm, 23 miles on the foot odometer just as I’d planned, I was still glad to hear Dot say out loud what I’d been thinking the last three days and wrote about yesterday.  “The trail’s been harder,” she said.  It was a relief that the young folks are thinking it, too.
We have seven SOBOs here at the shelter tonight.  Seven!  I don’t recall the last time we’ve had that many in one place – Dot, Franky, Buck, Funky Duck, Aloha, Flash, and myself.

This morning first thing I passed an important milestone – SOBO 1500 miles!  Unmarked, of course.  But today I couldn’t take the time to make a marker.  
The first big climb today was up Sinking Creek Mountain, an odd name for a mountain.  But more strange was the sign at the top that said that this is the Eastern Continental Divide.  What’s that?  The sign says 405 miles to the Atlantic Ocean and 1920 miles to the Gulf of Mexico.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I haven’t seen a sign like that before.

For a weekday the trail felt dotted with people.  Three groups hiked out to the 18-foot-circumference Keffer Oak, and there were two sets of section hikers.  But by far the best encounter was with “Old Joe,” age 77, and his three “young” early 60s companions – Todd, Ed, and Ken.  They’d made one of today’s difficult climbs but were in fine spirits.  When I first walked up one asked me, “Do you know where you are?”  I answered, “Yes, isn’t this the Pacific Crest Trail?”  We talked for 15 minutes, which says a lot right there.  They were the ones who told me about the apple trees on Sinking Creek Mountain.  Here’s a selfie of us http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and a photo of the apples  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  .

If I do another 23-mile day I’ll be set up to walk into Pearisburg on Sunday morning, which is my goal.

“Make wise decisions,” I hear her voice all the way from Denmark where she is now.

Finally, Ben has left the trail.  Good riddance!

I’m referring to Ben’s Bug Spray.  There are no more flying, biting, obnoxious bugs.  I sent away my bottle of Ben’s almost two weeks ago.  Tonight Dot told me she had done the same.

Fall is 5 days away.  Our third season on the trail. (Frodo: I hate to break it to you, but Fall starts on September 22nd this year.  That’s when the equinox is.  But that should actually be good news.)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578057,"“Bad News, guys, the zipline is down.”  That’s not a line I expected to hear out here.  I’ll admit, I’ve occasionally thought that between some of the AT ups and downs a zipline would be great.  But today there’s a trail angel, The Captain, located across a 75-foot stream, who has a zipline up for hikers to cross to his backyard.  He has sodas. At least for the NOBOs.  Franky was there a year ago when he hiked the first 800 miles northbound.  But once again, it’s the fate of the SOBOs – there are so few of us, the angels are gone.  Franky says that when he was hiking northbound he had trail magic – coolers or grilled food – every two to three days.  We haven’t seen trail magic for many weeks.
The  longest day I’ve hiked so far is 23.7 miles.  I really wanted to do 25 today into the Rice Field Shelter.  That would leave me with 8 to Pearisburg tomorrow where the Woods Hole Hostel folks will pick up most of my gear and then I’ll slackpack the 11 miles to the hostel.  I really want to get there before dinner.

So today I saw the sun rise a good ten minutes after I had already started hiking.  In the morning’s chill I knocked off the first of two 1700-foot climbs.  That’s what today was, two long climbs with five to seven miles of high ridge walking before dropping down.  
I usually hike straight through till lunch, no breaks except to get water and do my business in the bushes.  I had lunch at 2:00 today.  And I’d covered 15 miles.

After lunch there was a sight that would have affected some people’s digestion.  What it will also do is make Frodo grateful she’s married to me.  (Frodo: Ah, I’m ALWAYS glad and grateful that I’m married to you!)  It will also make the great shorts debate of earlier this summer seem such a petty thing.  Viewer discretion is advised, and Princesses beware: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
During the afternoon I hiked with Dot and Franky.  At one point Dot fell behind, and then she came back up the trail to us in a rush.  Special Delivery.  Flowers for Franky.http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

And speaking (writing?) of flowers, today there were new ones I haven’t seen before on the AT.  Oddly for this time of year they are buds getting ready to open.  And oddly they look like the PCT’s blue gentian of Northern California.  Anyone know what these are?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...","War Spur Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578206,"As you’ve probably felt from me the last four days, I’ve been pressing, trying to make miles, all of which might result in the difference of an hour or two or three today.  It would be the difference between participating in the Woods Hole Hostel communal dinner or arriving after it’s over, between being here for the late afternoon yoga or not.  When I woke this morning I felt “I have this in the bag.”  I was hiking at 6:55, sunrise 15 minutes later, powering the 8 miles into Pearisburg and hitting the town Dairy Queen at 10:30, with a tall Orange Julius soon in hand and a burger not long after.
It felt like a day-long celebration, no matter that it included 18 miles of hiking.  
Just before I started the AT, Lil’ Buddha reached out, said Woods Hole Hostel was his best hostel experience on the AT and he wanted to treat me.  So, up there with meeting the Princesses, with McAfee Knob and Mahoosuc Notch, I’ve been looking forward to this place. 
Neville from the hostel drove in to town to pick up my pack and most of my gear, so I could slackpack the last 10 miles.  So did Funky Duck, Dot, and Franky.  I got to help cook dinner and do yoga with my SOBO peeps.  And now I am sleeping on a bed in a large loft in the 20-foot-high great room of a restored 1880s cabin.  Happy, full of food and companionship.  Thankful on the AT.

Today was canning day at Woods Hole.  And I mean canning with a capital “C”.  Easily more than a bathtub full of tomatoes were washed, stemmed, and quartered.  I spent an hour quartering a fraction of them.  After all the boiling down, using two separate professional stoves, all burners lit, pots a 5-year-old could hide in, there was enough tomato sauce to feed an army. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Then the wind rose, followed by a crisp sharp patter.  The wind increased, the sound rose and by the thousands they fell.  
Why am I still sitting here?  Why was my first instinct to smile in awe of Mother Nature? Why was my second to capture it on video?

Gracefully arcing, see-sawing the air and falling all about me in the open space of this campground where I’m taking lunch are thousands of yellow leaves.  As they slowly ricocheted across branches and as the brittle palm-sized forms hit the ground, they sounded exactly like rain.

I’d never seen so many fall at once.  Looking straight overhead it was a golden cascade.  All for me.  On the AT, alone, but to be shared with you.
Why would someone name a waterfall ""Dismal Falls""?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I’m back on pretty dang nice trail tread here in southwestern Virginia.  I don’t think any climb was over 500 feet, and the 21.7 miles felt well attainable all day.  But we are water challenged.  More than half the water sources are dry and you can’t really tell where there will be a serviceable pool or flow.  I fill up hours in advance of lunch and do the same for dinner.  I’ve been around a few hikers lately that have run uncomfortably low and I’ve had enough to share.

So whose idea was it to swap out my one-pound 40° sleeping bag for the pound-and-a-half 30° bag?  I could be walking around as bare as the tighty-whitey guy the other day and at nightfall here at the shelter I’d be just comfortable fine.  I think I’ll be on top of my bag for a good part of the night.

I arrived at 6:15 to find the shelter deserted.  I’d only seen one couple and one single hiker all day.  By dusk at 7:30 I thought I’d have the small six-person shelter to myself.  But at 7:45, nearing dark, I heard footsteps.  And that’s what has me worried now an hour later.

“I lost my water,” he said.  An odd phrasing.  I’d never seen him before and I wasn’t getting an experienced vibe from him.  “Lost,” when I asked, meant that in an unclear manner he’s accidentally poured out his water.  The guide says there’s a spring one-tenth of a mile away, but I’ve stopped trusting the guide.  I filled up a mile back at a sketchy stream near an open campsite.  I wasn’t surprised when he came back empty-handed.  My next water isn’t for 10 miles, and his next source as he heads northbound is just that one mile.  But he didn’t listen when I offered dinner water and instead took off in the dark, leaving his pack here.  He’s been gone 45 minutes … When does concern change to having to do something?

Whew – he just showed up.  As happens on the trail, things change, turn on a dime.  You never know what’s around the next bend.

And things just keep getting better as I wind along the crest of Brushy Mountain, which the trail is sticking to for over 30 miles, with relatively mild ups and downs.  And I have good cell coverage so I can reach Frodo, who has gone from six time zones ahead to three time zones behind, Denmark to San Diego.  And as if just talking to her isn’t enough good luck, as I drop into the I-77 corridor and cross over the freeway on a two-lane road, where the guidebook clearly states there are no town services for at least 2.5 miles, there for my eyes and stomach to behold is the Brushy Mountain Outpost and Café!!  I always say you never know what’s around the next bend and we joke about the next mountaintop having a trailside ice cream stand.  But here it actually was!

Water remains a challenge.  More than half the sources in the Guide are dry and it’s hard to tell which ones you can trust.  I know, I know, on the PCT having 8- to 12-mile stretches without water would be absolutely nothing to write about or whine over, but it’s the uncertainty that’s unsettling.  I’ve taken to loading up with two liters often, a mighty unusual load for me on this trail.

We hovered up high, at 4,000 feet for nearly ten miles and then jumped to nearly 4,500.  I took advantage of a time when I had cell coverage, and the result was a trail of tears.  Mine.

Back in the other world this is an important day.  It’s Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, and our temple choir is missing one of its basses – me.  I’ve sung in the choir for over 25 years.  There are moments when our 35 voices join as movingly as that sunrise from Riga Shelter back in July, as beautifully as the mighty views from Katahdin last June.  (Frodo:  In many ways, Barney [Scout] is the soul of the choir.  He always has a great attitude and is very upbeat and the basses are often laughing when they should be paying attention.  He leads the basses in some stunt just before the start of evening Rosh Hashanah services – wearing Groucho Marx masks, or hulas skirts and leis, or as Elvis look-alikes.  When he missed Rosh Hashanah two years ago as he hiked the CDT, the whole choir did a stunt – they wore Barney masks!  Of course, they sent him photos and made him cry!)

Our temple has recently begun a live internet feed of services over the web.  I pulled it up on my phone.  Oh, my gosh, there was the choir singing.  I joined in the bass part out loud.  I could see the choir.  But no, it’s only the sopranos and tenors, the altos and Frodo were out of view, as were my basses.  I tried a long shot.  I am good friends with Jesse, our AV Tech.  I texted him.  Could he pan the camera so I could see Frodo?  From the booth overlooking the well-dressed crowd in their suits and ties and dresses, Jesse got it.  He texted me back and next thing I know, three time zones away there in her white robe was my Frodo.  There were my basses in the row behind her.  
I raised my voice and sang along.  And tears streamed down my face to be a part of them from so far away.

I texted Jesse to tell her that I’d seen and I’d heard her.  Then to conserve power I had to shut it off.  And soon enough I dropped off the ridge and lost my connection.

May it be a good, sweet, fulfilling, and rich year for each one of you and for all of yours.

(Frodo:  He didn’t see it until he had wi-fi the next day, but the Rabbi gave him a shout-out sometime after Scout stopped watching.  Here’s what he said:  “I also want to give a shout-out to Barney Mann.  Hi, Barney.  Barney is….. is crazy.  [Lots of laughs from the congregation]  Barney is on the Appalachian Trail.  And this is his third amazing trail hike, right, Barney?  He did the Pacific Crest Trail, he did the Continental Divide, and now he’s on the Appalachian Trail.  He’s been out there for months and he’s going to be back with us in October.  He’s usually sitting here with our choir.  Sandy his wife told me that he’s watching, so Barney, a shout-out to you; you’re with us in spirit.”","Jenkins Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578513,"Why is the lead photo above of two water bottles, rather than of the brilliant orange and pink cloud sunset?  Because the sunset was over the truck ___ (Frodo: something I can’t decipher) in Atkins, Virginia, as I spent a night in a motel.  And the water bottles are more meaningful to me.
To filter my water I’ve used a Sawyer Squeeze the whole trail.  It lives attached to a liter-size “Smart Water” bottle that I fill from pond or stream.  Then I squeeze that water bottle, hard, four or five times sustained, for each liter of clean water I’ve drunk on the trail.  Think about compressing and expanding a water bottle over a thousand times over the past four months.  On the left is what remains of my water bottle.  “Keep it,” Franky chimed in.  “Get rid of that disgusting thing,” Dot responded.  Any guess which side Frodo comes down on?  I know for sure she will be happy that I’ve swapped it out.

And today during 15 miles of hiking we passed the ¾ mark.  Actually it said ¼, because the trail is northbound-centric.  But regardless, somehow I missed it. 
We had 15 miles of well-maintained trail with ups and downs, but none like that photo I posted last week of a sheer vertical length of trail that prompted a journal reader to write to me, “Seriously?”

At the Atkins trailhead there’s a famed restaurant “The Barn.”  Here are before and after photos of Franky demolishing a full one-pound hamburger.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It’s the first day of fall and the trail announces it loud and clear by dressing up:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... You couldn’t even see it for all the leaves.  And on the serious side, it will make it harder to avoid stepping on roots and rocks, and harder to find the trail when it’s sketchy.  But the changing colors are darn pretty.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578610,"Happy “National Public Lands” Day!  Now, I had no idea it was a special day when I started hiking at 7:05 am.  Nor did I have any idea an hour later when the trail went right past a “Settler’s” Museum and an 1800s schoolhouse.  The desks were arranged inside and they allow hikers to spend the night, laying out their pads and bags in between the wooden desks.  There’s a framed reprint of 1870 student punishments.  If boys and girls played together, 4 lashes.  For wearing long fingernails, 2 lashes, and for every foot above 3 feet that you climbed in a tree you got 1 lash per foot.  A few miles later, at the next shelter, a hiker had made a list of hiker punishments.  For squabbing (Frodo:??) with northbounders, 4 lashes.  For bitching about the White Mountains, 4 lashes,  For enjoying Connecticut 5 lashes.
At 10.5 miles the trail came to the Mt. Rogers Ranger Station and Visitor Center.  I still didn’t know it was National Public Lands Day and this was where I was going to have lunch.  I know it’s a Saturday, but the parking lot looked particularly crowded.  Then a Forest Service greeter gave me the news, “We’re celebrating National Public Lands Day, and we have free hot dogs and chips.""  
Hot dogs, grilled!
And after the hot dogs, there was a booth with rattlesnakes, copperheads, and others.  I’ll bet Frodo’s glad they only handed me the 5-foot black snake. (Frodo: Well, yes, but I wasn’t really worried that someone from the Forest Service would hand you a rattlesnake!)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...Hey, Princesses, that snake was longer than any of you are tall.  Which one of you would have held it?  I’m betting Sophia.

It’s a Saturday, so I actually ran in to three hikers – a crowd – during the afternoon’s ten miles.  One of the hikers was Pencil Pusher, who we shared a shelter with back in the Shenandoahs.

There are so many places when we hike along a ridge that I know just 50 feet away, through the thicket of trees, there are great views.  But it never happens.  I’m used to it, but still marvel at this green tunnel.

I finished my 21 miles by just after 6:00 pm and found Funky Duck at the Trimpi Shelter.  Some rather barrel-chested guys of my vintage, weekenders, have set up inside the shelter.  Making wise decisions, I set up my tent.  (Frodo:  He thought they looked like big snorers!)

Tomorrow we will brush up against 5000 feet and at day’s end will enter the Grayson Highlands, where they have free-roaming “wild” ponies.

I just took my own 10-minute cat nap.  But there was no wind and I did not wake to find a coverlet of leaves.  I have 13.5 miles done, two of today’s three 1000-foot-plus climbs accomplished, and the place I’m going to rest my head is less than 7 miles away.
(Frodo: Not sure what I'm supposed to do with this photo, but here it is: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...)
Ponies.  Ponies.  Last thing today I will cross into Grayson Highlands State Park where wild ponies roam.  I’ve known about Grayson for as long as I’ve known about McAfee Knob.  The landscape is supposed to be special and unique.  
I’ve decided to name the ponies that will let me get close enough to take their pictures.  Don’t worry, Frodo, I won’t get too close.  I’ll name them after the Princesses and Reuben.

We’ve been getting some rockier trail, but the last two days the water has been more reliable.

My toothbrush broke.  Yes, the trail must be less than spectacular here if I’m writing about my toothbrush.  But bear with me.  Once upon a time, when we all had external frame packs, we took along regular toothbrushes and toothpaste.  Then came ultralight.  Frodo and I converted, “Halleluyah, amen!” in 2003 when we hiked the 211-mile John Muir Trail.  Instead of 50 grams worth of toothbrush and toothpaste (Frodo: It was more than that!), we shared a toothbrush with no handle that you slipped over a fingertip and has two short rows of bristles.  We bought it online as an ultralight toothbrush for backpacking.  It weighed 2 grams and we squirted a couple of grams of toothpaste into a tiny baggie.  It didn’t work very well.  Afterward we learned it was actually a dog toothbrush.  That’s the last time we’ve gone that extreme.  My present toothbrush was just a small toothbrush.  I think it was out of one of the kits the airlines provide when you are stranded somewhere overnight due to a maintenance issue.  It weighed maybe half as much as a regular toothbrush.  I used it all of the CDT and all of the AT so far.  Till yesterday.  The handle broke in half.  It still works, but it looks like I shortened it on purpose. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... (Frodo: You mean it makes you look like even more of a gram weenie than you already are?!)

I always notice when a blown-down tree has recently been removed from the trail.  Today there were wood shavings that indicated the removal was very recent and it must have been a jumble of blown-down trees.  I wonder if they were victims of Hurricane Irma.  Here you’ll see how wonderfully it was cleared away and it won’t take much imagination to picture what a mess to hike through it must have been.  Thanks, trail crew!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Three miles before reaching the Wise Shelter, my destination, I saw one – a pony.  White with caramel swaths.  Cute as a button and very approachable.  I dub thee Catherine, after the oldest Princess.  Can any other pony be that cute?

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578695,"I sauntered and dawdled this morning.  Or at least what passes as such for a thru-hiker.  Why don’t I linger a moment in this trailside campsite, savor the close-cropped grass that would be more at home on a putting green than the AT.  With the campsite in the foreground let me try to capture the view – nine, yes, nine distinct mountain ridges, one after the other.  I try to capture it with a lens, with millions of pixels at my disposal, but even with that height of modern technology I’ll likely fail.  In the background ponies nicker.
Further ahead I can see the trail tread approaching Mt. Rogers.  When was the last time I could see the AT a half mile ahead?  I wouldn’t be surprised if the heads of elves or fairies popped up into view.

I walk off trail to introduce myself to ponies.  When I was a child, once a year a man with a pony would walk the neighborhood door to door, offering to take your child’s picture on his pony.  Now I return the favor, taking these ponies’ photos for free.  
This one is Sophia:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
This one is Jessica.  Oops, maybe not on closer inspection.  It’s Reuben Scout:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And this feisty one is Jessica:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
If you were thinking about staying at Thomas Knob Shelter, don’t unless it’s raining.  Stay at the campsite a mile north of the shelter.  It’s flat, with scrumptious views, grass as soft and neat as peach fuzz on a shorn head.

None of this is “above” treeline, but wide stretches of these highlands have only shrubs easy to see over and the few trees don’t block the view.  I haven’t walked through this much open country since the mountain tops of Maine.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And since I mentioned the number nine, the number of successive distinct ridges before the distant horizon swallowed up any more, I must mention the real important number of the day.  It is not 1,700.  This morning I reached that AT milestone.  It is not 12, the number of miles I have till I walk into Damascus, Virginia, tomorrow.  The important number is “6”.  That’s the number of days till I see Frodo again.

Today I had lunch at Buzzard Rock with a full 360° view – a rare AT event.  Tonight I am stealth camping by myself; the cicadas making the usual deafening but ignorable racket.  I am going to read a little more, munch a Butterfinger candy bar, and then turn off my headlamp, snug in my tent.  (Frodo:  I can’t help but think, “What about your teeth??”)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578761,"Instead of shouting for joy, the Fall palette is weeping and crying.  The falling leaves haven’t been akin to falling rain.  How could I have been so dense?  The sound of falling leaves has been the sound of tears.
I had expected Fall bursts of color.  Back at the University of Oregon in law school, I’d wait for certain trees, certain stands to strut their stuff on the Fall catwalk, brilliant yellows of van Gogh, reds impossibly bright and rivaling the screaming color of fire engines.  Here, the leaves fall like tufts of hair from a cancer patient, splotches of color quickly overridden by shades of brown.  Already I walk through stands of trees with silvery branches showing bare.  Where is Fall’s brilliant show?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
“Silent Spring”  “Dull Fall”

I have 12 miles to go to Damascus, perhaps the most famous of all AT trail towns.  During AT “Trail Days” in spring the town balloons from 800 to 15,000!  Scores of booths, a great hiker parade, an epic squirt gun and water gun fight, and food, food, food. 
I am on trail at 7:03 am and I walk slowly.  Not because I’m hurting, but the light is still faint and I don’t want to stumble or fall.  The sun pokes its nose up 20 minutes later and illuminates the green tunnel.  (Frodo:  But isn’t it now brownish and silvery?)

I am thinking about grilled cheese sandwiches.  The ones I will make for myself, and or Dot and Franky if they are there at the Virginia Creeper Hostel.  Open-faced, multi-grain bread, sliced bell pepper, tomatoes, and green onions tucked under the crispy melted sharp cheddar cheese and the bread bottom slathered with butter and browned.  (Frodo: “crispy melted” may seem like a misnomer, but Scout likes to cook his melted cheese to the point of crispness.  Go figure.) 
At 11:30 I walk into town.  The AT saunters down Main Street like it owns the place.  Turns out there are 5 of us SOBOs here, a far cry from 15,000.  After buying two bags of groceries from Food City I made those grilled cheese sandwiches.  Those as well as apple and orange wedges and barbeque potato chips materialized on plates for the three of us. I don’t know how many sighs of contentment I gave out savoring that lunch.

“Scout, where are the pig photos?”  That’s the essence o the message I got rom the three princesses’ dad.  How could I write about them at Woods Hole Hostel and not include a photo??  That’s a trail sin worth writing down at The Priest Shelter.  I called Neville at Woods Hole and she sent me photos.  They are pot-belly pigs and they are so cute and adorable they must be named after the Princesses --- Did I just hear an “Oh, yuuucckk!” from three time zones away?  The gray pig is Catherine, the light brown pig with the mud line is Sophia, and that’s right, Jessica, that’s the name I give to the spotted one with its belly almost dragging on the ground.  The duck is Reuben Scout.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
You don’t know how much you miss a kitchen and cooking until you’re restricted to a stove weighing less than an ounce.  Dot, Franky, and I whipped up a salad with grilled salmon, spaghetti squash laden with marinara, garlic bread, brownies and ice cream.  I know – foods unrepentant.  (Frodo:  The last line was squished at the bottom of the page, but I’m nearly certain that’s what it says.)","Campsite near Beartree Gap Trail

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578792,"Day 124, Sep 27, 0 in Damascus, VA Creeper

 

Coming toward town yesterday I was acutely aware that for the entire 12 miles there’s a popular alternate path, a “Rails to Trails” path, a flat one-percent-grade path, wide, alongside the river.  All the while I, on the AT, climb up, down, including one 800-foot climb.  As much as Damascus is famous as the Appalachian Trail town, it is also famous for the 34-mile Virginia Creeper foot and bike path. Town businesses include bike rental shops, shuttles, and the place I’m staying is its eponymous namesake (Frodo: Umm… I think that’s a bit redundant.)  Converting old railroad rights-of-way to recreational footpaths, just like our National Parks is another great American idea.  The lead photo is of an old railroad bridge, where the AT deigned to descend onto the easily-trod path to cross a river.

Doing zero day chores – and it’s a good time to thank Barbara and Anne who confirmed that the tightly closed purple lower is an East Coast gentian, though one says “bottle” gentian and the other says “soapwort” or “closed”.  I vote or “closed” as a second mystery to me was why are they earning brown without ever opening?  How the heck do they get pollinated if they never open?  (Frodo:  Maybe they self-pollinate, like Mendel’s pea flowers.)  Here’s a photo o a second set of gentian-like lowers, much smaller, a half inch instead of an inch long, and more clusters.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Another mystery to me the last few days arose from these wonderful open highlands.  They are called “Balds”.  Today I asked an expert, the ATC Southern Regional Director Morgan, “What’s the difference between “above treeline’ and a ‘bald’?”  Morgan said that down here they would calculate ‘above treeline’ would be above 8300 feet.  So none of that exists.  High points here are in the 6,000s.  “We don’t really know what causes balds.”  He said theories include grazing by large ruminants – wood bison and elk once populated these southern mountains, fires set on purpose by Native Americans, or maybe just “too thick” soil for trees.  Whatever the reason, there will be many more in the miles ahead in which to scratch my own thinning=hair head, and to thoroughly enjoy.

Boy, it’s hard, but I am restraining myself from talking about the four-letter “” word – food!

Finally, I was in Food City supermarket with Franky, finishing up my resupply shopping, when a man came up to us.  “Are you Scout?”  He hopes to hike the AT in a few years.  He’s been following my journal, loved meeting Franky, and glowed as he spoke of watching Dot’s YouTube videos.  So here’s a shout-out to Alan Skyzypczak.  (Frodo:  Scout wrote that out VERY neatly, thank goodness!)  (Scout:  Maybe he wants to hike the AT to get a nice simple trail name.)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578845,"Late morning and I’m eight miles south of Damascus, the 2,000-foot climb done, and I run into Evo, who’s hiking northbound.  He makes me eel like a second fiddle not once, but twice.
I had just mentioned my wife’s name after 5 minutes of conversation.  “Oh, Frodo!  You’re the Scout with Frodo?  Why she’s famous!”  He’d heard of Frodo and her PCT Trail Angeling.  That Scout guy, me, was chopped liver.  (Frodo:  Wow!  That’s weird!  All our trail angelling is as a unit, almost Scoutandfrodo.  And NO ONE thinks off you like chopped liver.  Besides, you and I both really like chopped liver, especially on good fresh rye bread with onions and tomatoes – yum!)

And just before that it was, “Are you the Scout with Dot?  I follow her YouTube videos!” He was crushed to learn that he’d just missed seeing her by ten miles.  “You were the one in her line dance video, right?”  Again, second fiddle.  But I’m always willing to stand behind these great women. 
BEAR!  Just before reaching the Abingdon Gap Shelter or lunch I thought I heard a tree branch fall and snap, and then the thump of another.  I stopped, looked, and saw nothing moving on the ground.  Then scrambling down a two-foot-bore tree trunk was a bear cub.  It moved its four paws just as fast as the itsy-bitsy spider in the water spout.  It was jet black and cute as the dickens.  See it was a bear, not a BEAR.  That’s not to say that this cuddly ball of ursine flesh, if you held it on your lap, wouldn’t _____ (Frodo: can’t read this word, but “eviscerate” will do) your gullet or your guts with its scimitar claws.  From 40 feet away it was cute.  I walked on, singing “On Top of Old Smokey” just in case Mama was around.

At the shelter at lunch, I had another animal encounter.  John, whom I’d first seen when Not-A-Moose was with me three weeks ago, was there with his trail dog, Blue.  I had just sat down, removed my shoes and socks, and was taking my first bites when I felt a stick deposited across my feet.  Blue had put it there.  Blue looked at me with those big expectant eyes.  “Pick it up, Scout.  Pick it up.”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I entered my 12th state today.  Even though Virginia was the longest trail state, I wasn’t emotional.  (What, Scout, not getting all worked up about it?” Frodo might say.  (Frodo:  I would never say that!)

When I crossed my first AT state line leaving Maine after over 400 miles, I was moved to tears.  But after the dozenth state, I wasn’t all that moved.  (I know, Frodo, “dozenth” may not be a word, but it should be.) (Frodo: It actually IS a real word!)
(Frodo:  Here's a photo Scout included, of a restroom):  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
On the Continental Divide Trail, its informal motto or slogan is, “Embrace the Brutality!”  For the AT my good friend Rolling Thunder adopted the tagline, “Embrace the Civility!”  In Maine and northern New Hampshire the AT was as civil as a _____ . (Frodo:  I really can’t read this word, but I think he means it was the opposite of civil!)  But the majority of the time since then, today included, the trail has been quite civil.  This morning’s 2000-foot climb was polite and had good table manners.  The ups and downs, as we stayed high, were well-behaved children.  Nice trail tread, and the recent blowdowns had all been cleared, too.  Tennessee starts well.

On the PCT my pack was a Gossamer Gear G5.  It weighed 8 ounces.  Yes, you read that right.  But it had to be babied a bit.  The pack’s “End of Trail"" photo showed patches galore.  When we thanked Glen van Peski, Gossamer Gear’s founder and the Dean of ultralight gear, he said, “It’s more a testament to you two that the packs made it.""
Two and a half years ago I found my new love, a Z Packs “Blast.”  17 ounces.  Today the bloom may be off the rose, cuben fiber color faded, but that baby that was supposed to last one thru-hike has now nearly lasted two.  She’s looking pretty good for a gal who’s got 5000 miles of hard wear.  “Rode hard, and put away wet.”

She broke a tooth two days ago.  On the chest strap buckle.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   I’ve grown to love my chest strap.  Three teeth hold it snug, and one broke.  Are they teeth or, like a fork, are they tines?  The outfitter in Damascus had half a dozen different sizes, but none as small as mine.  So what did I do?  I turned cannibal.  The strap across the top of my pack is secured by the same size buckle.  I got out my knife and cut.  I ignored the lurid screams.  Actually, no.  There are two strap closures across the top, and I’d just sacrificed one on the altar of ingenious thinking.  Today, my chest strap is once again snug against my chest.

Rain!  Umbrella up!  There was no rain in the forecast, but sometimes I think Mother Nature doesn’t know how to read.  If only the rain might quickly renew the dry springs and creekbeds.  We remain water challenged here in northern Tennessee.  In fact, for almost the first time, when I meet a northbound hiker, trail conversations sound more like we are on the PCT – “Where’s the next water?  Was so-and-so spring dry?  Is there water at the shelter?”

And will someone tell me why there are no privies at Tennessee shelters?  It’s not that I use shelter privies that much; I’m happy out in the woods.  But I noticed a certain odor near the last shelter…

Nice trail tread today, largely trending down toward my day’s destination, miles-long Wataugua Lake.  But the last few miles along the lakeshore were maddening for me.  I was expecting easy, but I got thrown back to Maine lakes instead.  I know that a lake’s shoreline is level, so why am I going up and down, up and down?  I think I was just ready to get to the Boots Off Hostel a few miles too soon.

“Muscle Tough.”  My sister retired today.  Seventeen years leading high-level health programs for Santa Fe School District.  I had coverage so I sent her a text.  I’m Jewish, so I wished her “Mazel Tov!”  I dictated the message into the phone as I hiked.  I had wished her “Muscle Tough” instead.

I am grateful for every log that has been cleared from across the trail.  But here's one that put an extra-big smile on my face.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Above is the hiker shower at Boots Off Hostel.  The hot and cold water go into the bucket, where they sort of mix together before draining down on you.  Pretty cool.
This evening starts Yom Kippur.  Normally I’d be in services this evening and most of the day tomorrow.  I would fast and I would sing in the choir.  In 2007 on our PCT hike we fasted.  And hiked.  More on that tomorrow.  Tonight I wish you Muscle Tough.","Stealth Campsite beyond TN 91

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579087,"I was up early at Boots Off Hostel, packed in the dark, wolfed down two chocolate donuts and an orange, ready to get a jump on a hoped-for 23-mile day.  Then I saw it.
I often say, “I have one soulmate, three best friends, six very important women in my life, and likely fifty from whom I could get or give a hug at any time.”  (Frodo: That last one should be at least a hundred.)  But that’s wrong.  There are four best friends.  And I spotted a first cousin of my fourth best friend at the hostel and I stopped in my tracks.  I’d been ready for a 7:20 pre-sunrise start.

My guitar is a best friend.  It’s always been there for me.  My guitar helped Frodo fall in love with me.  It’s always there when I’m down.  With my guitar in hand I could get 100 campers to sing silly camp songs, at 7:30 am or pm.  Four times since Katahdin I’ve had access to a guitar.  And there tucked between the refrigerator and the sink at Boots Off hiker area was a dusty guitar.  I had to give it 15 minutes, didn’t I?  Tuned, played, heard the four around me grow quiet, saw them mouthing the words.  15 minutes is a half mile or more out here.

The opening climb of 1000-foot-plus was smooth enough and then late morning the AT dropped into Laurel Stream Canyon.  Except for the dense trees and rhododendrons, it almost felt Sierra-like.  Cascading stream, pools, waterfalls, culminating in 70-foot-high Laurel Falls.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  We won’t mention the getting lost on a side trail that turned out not to be the AT.  15 more minutes.

Today is Yom Kippur.  It’s the pinnacle of Jewish holidays.  If I was home I would fast for 24 hours, no food or water.  Ten years ago in 2007, Yom Kippur fell two weeks before we finished our PCT thru-hike.  Somehow I got in my head that Frodo and I should fast on the trail.  Cold rain turned to snow that night and we had 16 tough, freezing miles the next day before eating or drinking again.  I had fasted every year since I was 13, so over 40 years running, and I thought it would be meaningful.  I was wrong; it was miserable.  It wasn’t spiritual, it was painful.  
So I am not fasting today, but I have been thinking about the heart of the day – who have I wronged, who have I offended, and are there apologies I need to make.  We are not supposed to just confess, but to seek out the wronged party and try to make it right.  And what if the wronged person won’t accept your apology?  There’s a rule for that, too.  Your duty is to apologize three times.  After that, even if not accepted, you’re absolved.

I will ask Frodo tomorrow, if there is anything I have done for which an apology is warranted.  
ONE.  She flies out tomorrow and will hike in less than a mile to Overmountain Shelter!!!!  She’ll have with her Blazer (from our 2007 PCT hike)  and Blazer's brother Ian.  All three are hiking with me for a day and a half.  Which is why I pressed all day, not finishing until deep into dusk.  I wanted 23 miles.  22.8 will have to do.

I power out the first ten miles.  Blazer and Inyo are coming with Frodo.  Blazer, six days younger than our son, hiked with us on and off on the PCT.  On this day in 2007 she was there when I snapped that photo of Frodo plowing through snow that was mid-thigh deep only 40 (!) miles from Canada, after we’d hiked 2,600 miles.  Blazer was there the next morning when, for the first time in then 30 years of marriage, we both forgot Frodo’s birthday.  That morning, as we stomped figure 8s in the snow to stay warm as we waited for two of our group to pack up, Blazer shocked us when she called out “Happy birthday, Frodo!  What do you want for your birthday?”  Frodo’s sincere answer: “I want to get out of this day alive.”  
Blazer’s brother Inyo hiked most of the Sierra Nevada with her, which is one of the toughest sections on the PCT.

The three of them, Frodo, Blazer, and Inyo, will hike in about ¾ of a mile tonight and then they’ll hike with me for a day and a half.  I want them to have a real AT experience.  I so hope that includes hiking with some of my AT peeps.  But I fear that Dot, Franky, and any of the rest are at least a half day ahead.

At ten and a half miles, near the road into the next town, Roan Mountain, I heard a shout.  “Scout!”  It was Aloha.   He was caught in a hamburger-and-beer vortex.  A nice section hiker had been plying him with them in a campsite with a warm fire.  It was already near noon and Aloha had been there since the evening before.  (… scurry, scurry, another mouse just ran by in the edge of my headlamp beam…)  Aloha was hoping I’d come by and pull him away.  
We crossed the road together and started THE CLIMB.  Am I going to write about how hard and how long it was?  No.  We chatted our way up.  Aloha, in his early 20s, told me how this hike has changed him, made him different now in so many positive ways.  The climb was on wonderful trail tread, grade designed not to punish but to reward.  We had lunch with nearly 2000 feet climbed, right at the Tenessee/North Carolina state line.  Our 13th state.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Aloha had cell coverage and reached Dot and Franky.  “Scout, they are two miles behind us.”  My gosh, I’ll have three of my AT cohort with Frodo, Blazer, and Inyo tonight.  My smile, thinking of seeing Frodo in a few hours, got even broader.  
I phoned Inyo as he and Blazer were stopping at a grocery store.  I told him there will be 7 of us tonight.  He’s going to hike in some wine.

And just when the day couldn’t get any better, a mile before Hump’s summit we broke out of a typical AT thicket into a wide-open bald.  We can see the trail for a good mile ahead.  The wind whipped the amber waves of grain and low grasses.  I wanted to burst out in song.  We talked, excited and ecstatic.  At the top, soft with lawn grass that would not be out of place at a house in the suburbs, we lay down, with our heads resting on our packs, marveling.  Dot and Franky popped into view.  They joined us, sunbathing in a sharp wind at 5600 feet.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...    http://www.trailjournals.com/j...    http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We practically flew the last four miles to Overmountain Shelter.

“It’s the best shelter on the AT,” more than one had said.  It’s a big old barn.  The hayloft can sleep a couple dozen.  There is a view of the sunrise that can rival that of Riga Shelter, back in July.

They didn’t mention the mice.  Dot jumps and shouts her version of “eek!”  Sassy, fearless mice run by her and up to the rafters, tightroping the beams like a vermin version of The Flying Wallenders.

In the dusk I see what I’ve been waiting for all day, hear the voice I’ve been wanting to hear for weeks.  Hug.  Big hug.  Then one for Blazer and Ian.  
Blazer is halfway unpacked – she’d heard about the mice but was largely dismissive – when she turned to her pack and yelped.  “There’s one in my pack!  No, two!”  She then hopped about, her pack upside down as she willy-nilly dumped out its contents.  This – like Frodo and Dot – is one of the strongest women I know.  I think that’s why it was so funny.

And then the real reward of the day.  In the dark, moonlight shining through the half-inch gaps between the barn slats, sitting in a tight circle, the 7 of us joshing and telling stories, we passed around wine, the finest boxed wine, and drank it out of whatever receptacle we had.  Aloha, a Gatorade bottle.  Frodo and I sipped from the salsa container she had brought to serve as a bowl.  We sat around the lighted pumpkin-scented candle-in-a-jar that Franky carries to be romantic.  
“Happy Birthday!” Blazer called.  No snow this time.  She pulled out a frosted cupcake, complete with candles.  There were cupcakes for all of us.  Frodo blew out her candles.

I didn’t ask her what she wished for this time.  But I don’t think she could have wished for a better end of the day in this circle of friendship.  
It’s 1:44 am, but I can now fall into the sleep of the just, journal done.  ‘Nite.","Walnut Mountain Rd

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579172,"“My thermometer reads 41 degrees!” said Aloha.  And that was while we were packing up, on the late side.  “It must have dropped into the high 30s.”  The only time this whole trek, in almost 130 days, that I had temperatures this low was back on my first night – Day 1 on Mars Hill with Rolling Thunder. 
Frodo even put on her down puffy jacket last night because she couldn’t get warm enough to fall asleep.  I wore mine – gratefully – as we started hiking.  Frodo hadn’t brought it a day too soon.

These shelter mice were not only circus acrobats, at least one was a rodent Harry Houdini.  Aloha hung his food bag on the usual mouse-proof hanging rope hook.  Somehow a mouse got down the thin rope, around the plastic cone, inside Aloha’s nylon stuff sack, and chewed on his tortillas.  And then it escaped again.  Harry Houdini in the 1920s was the era’s famed escape artist – no combination of handcuffs, chains, locks, or thick-walled steamer trunk could keep him contained for long.  So, too, the overmountain Shelter mice.  Aloha: “It will forever be a mystery!”

It was such a joy to hike with Frodo all day.  We have not hiked a full day together since the CDT two years ago.  It’s no small thing to just jump in for a thru-hiker day.  It’s like jumping onto a fast-moving conveyer belt.  Blazer and Ian well acquitted themselves.  Sixteen miles from shelter to shelter.  Up and down more open, view-filled balds, first Jane Bald and then Round Bald.  I do wonder how the three of them will feel tomorrow.  Will it be ibuprofen time?

The lead photo above may be the centerpiece of our holiday photo page.  But this one is a favorite, too.  Kissy, kissy.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  (Sorry for the mushy stuff, Princesses and Reuben.)

Here’s the four of us on top of Round Bald. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
I felt I had to keep on explaining, “The AT isn’t like this.  It really is a green tunnel.  This morning they had no reason to believe me.

We have been skirting the Tenessee/North Carolina state line.  A luxurious hotel was built up here in the 1880s.  The Cloudland Hotel was three stories and was grand indeed.  A stripe was painted down the middle of the dining room floor.  One side was North Carolina, a “dry” state, and the other side was Tenessee, where drinking alcohol was legal.  A North Carolina sheriff sometimes surreptitiously hung out and waited for drinking guests to forget and cross the line.  And what was the cost of this grand luxury in 1880?  $2 a day.

It was so great chatting with Blazer and Inyo, catching up on their lives.  And finally, Frodo had this weird hat deal going on:   http://www.trailjournals.com/j....  Actually, it’s my fault.  I had dropped my hat and she picked it up with her trekking pole so it wouldn’t blow away.  So I should apologize for making fun.  (Frodo:  darn right.)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579187,"“Hey, nice Dirty Girls!”  You want to be a thru-hiker?  Check out dirtygirlgaiters.com.  Make sure you include the “gaiters” part, or you might be surprised at what comes up.
Out here a thousand pebbles or bits of grit fight their way to get into your shoe.  Who wants to spend the day stopping, leaning against a tree or sitting on a log, taking off your shoe, shaking it out, and then reversing the process.  Wear gaiters instead.  But not just any gaiters.  You want the lightest.  You want to pick your pattern from amongst 50 choices.  Mine have usually lasted for 1500 miles.  I had a “stars and stripes” pair and now mine are rainbow hippy peace symbol ones.  The other four pairs belong to four spritely women who were out hiking a section of the trail and who really brightened up the day for Dot and me.

But I should have lead off with some big thank-yous before I got side-tracked with the dirty girls.  And by the way, the website is Princess-safe, though the patterns used to be heavy on skulls.

(Frodo:  I thought this story was going to transition into a confession.  Scout texted me the day before I flew here, asking me to bring him his spare pair of gaiters; he’d lost his.  So I dutifully did so.  It was not until I’d been here for five days that he found his old ones, shoved in the bottom of one of his side pockets.  Whoops.)

I am so grateful that Blazer and Inyo came down to hike with us.  Blazer came from Ketchikan, Alaska (look that up in your Rand McNally Atlas or, um, on Google Maps).  And Inyo came from Washington, D.C.  They flew in to Charlotte, NC, rented a car (a red Mustang convertible), drove over three hours, hiked in wine and Frodo birthday goodies.  It meant so much to share this experience with them.  After six miles this morning they hopped off the thru-hiker fast track and headed back to the airport.  I hope tomorrow morning that the good memories far outweigh the day-after-the-hike aches and pains.  
Frodo looked forward to tending to her own body’s aches when she got off after six miles, too.  Her rental car was parked at the road crossing; the three got in and set off to where the Mustang was parked an hour’s drive away.  
They also took most of our gear, so the four of us could slackpack for the next 11 miles.  My long-suffering, dedicated Frodo (Frodo: I added the adjectives.) then met us so we could schlep our gear to the next shelter, four miles further (out of 22 for the day).  I can’t express how grateful I and the other three are for this.  And tomorrow night we’ll get to sleep in a bed together, freshly showered,  Finally!  After over three weeks apart and then three days together but sleeping in bags.

I caught a good fall photo of Aloha in the “red tunnel” today.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579191,"I surprised myself.  I was the first one out of the shelter and on the trail.  7:15 is now the new 7:05.  And I still have to go slow at 7:15 because there is so little light.  Dot and Franky were packing up.  Aloha poked his head up out of his hammock.  I woke him and a hiker I’d met only once before, Suches, who soon tucked in behind me.  We’re heading to Uncle Johnny’s hiker hostel, on the trail, right outside of Erwin, TN.  I will see Frodo again there.  It’s “only” four miles.
Here’s our drill for today:  Hike four miles from the shelter to Uncle Johnny’s.  Meet Frodo and her rental SUV.  Give her most of our gear.  Slackpack 11 miles to Spivey Gap.  Meet Frodo after a little more than 15 miles, and also Mango and his wife Jane. (Mango was hosted by us in 2010 and hiked the southern 40% of the PCT that year.)  Stop for LUNCH in Erwin.  Proceed with Dot, Franky, and Aloha to Mango and Jane’s cabin on Ripshin Lake outside Roan Mountain.  Yes, I know, life is tough for an AT hiker.

Before I forget, I apparently created an off-trail firestorm.  Royalty divided; the Princesses erupted in discord over whose pony is the cutest. (Frodo: You mean you didn’t see that coming?!?) My peace plan was to have Reuben Scout decide, but Frodo vetoed that idea.  My apologies, Princess parents (Frodo: King and Queen?), but Happy 15th Anniversary!

The 12 miles from Uncle Johnny’s and the Nolichucky River to Spivey Gap looked tough.  But we slackers, er... slackpackers, formed a train and powered up the first half, a big climb.  We didn’t look at the time until noon.  “Only 4.9 miles to go!”  We met Frodo right on time – 2:15.  How’s that for 16 miles?
Mango and Jane’s cabin was right on the lake, with amazing views of the lake through the large windows.  Dinner was Caesar salad redolent with shaved parmesan, heirloom tomatoes http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  , chicken, bread generously slathered with butter.  For dessert, what Time magazine once declared “The Best Ice Cream You Can Buy In A Store” – Mayfield ice cream from a dairy in Athens, Tennessee.  Mango and Jane were terrific hosts, at least until moments ago, when Mango unleashed his chess prowess on poor Dot.  Here are Dot & Franky playing chess:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  
Miscellaneous:  Today we saw a tree that had grown fully enclosing a 2-inch-diameter fence bar.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Also, as we neared Uncle Johnny’s there was a succulent alongside the trail that belongs in the desert, not on the AT.  Answers, anyone?  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I have just finished a glass of white wine, “Kroger’s finest wine that comes in a box,”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  and I am about to go off to bed – not in a tent, not sticky and dirty, and with my Frodo alongside me.

We slept in this morning, getting up about 7:30 and heading upstairs to be greeted by Mango and Jane, the clean cheery faces of the zero-day-happy hikers, the glorious view of the lake, and a breakfast of quiche, cheese grits, toast and fruit.  True confession – I’ve never had grits before.  They were good.  Mango assured us these were genuine grits – cooked slow for a couple of hours.

Mango is taking his granddaughter to a storytelling festival today so we headed into Erwin this morning, anxious to get settled into our digs for the night.  There’s really only one functioning motel in town – the Super 8 – and we were pleased that they have a room for one night for Dot & Franky and a room for two nights for Scout and me.  You see, Jane had informed us that Erwin would be buzzing Friday and Saturday with the annual Apple Festival and that she was surprised we had been able to get motel reservations.  I was too chicken to tell her we hadn’t thought we would need reservations!  But all turned out well and we were even able to check in early.

We stopped by the Post Office and the library (that fortunately had a good selection of used paperbacks for sale in the basement )(Scout—I got one last book to rip up and take in sections on the trail.), then drove around looking for a non-fast-food, non-meat-centric restaurant.  Dot is vegetarian, after all.  We pretty much struck out, then drove toward the Wal-Mart on the outskirts of town, where we remembered seeing an Italian restaurant when we had lunch yesterday at a Mexican restaurant.  We first did resupply shopping, then tucked in for a great Italian lunch. 
The afternoon was spent with Scout doing emails, uploading photos, and participating in a telephonic board meeting for the Continental Divide Trail Coalition.  I spent much of the time working on logistics. Scout’s next zero day will be in popular Gatlinburg, TN, where most motels are booked up due to fall-color-viewing tourists.  Our son Sean will join Scout there and hike with him for a couple of big days.  Hope the trail will be kinder than it was when he joined Scout back in the very-tough Maine/New Hampshire border area.  So I’m setting up a complicated shuttle for them and for Sean’s car.  I think it will end up working well.  Fingers crossed.

I am really, REALLY glad that Scout will be home soon (Scout: I have been reading all this entry, hoping to turn the table, and that I’ll get to make a snarky comment and then she throws this in. Not fair.)  It’s been a long time, but there’s only about three weeks left.  It’s great that I could come east several times to spend time with him and provide support, but I still miss having him at home.  I look forward to working together in our yard, cooking together in our kitchen, chatting randomly throughout the day, and waking up to him each morning.  I certainly am way behind on my hug quota! (Scout—As am I. I look forward to the time we can turn to the other with open arms and not be three time zones away.)

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579290,"""On the AT I can’t remember saying to myself, 'I’m really having fun.'”  Mango, our host Wednesday night, said this.  He has hiked both the AT and the PCT.  “Sure, the AT was interesting, at times exciting.  But on the PCT, many days I remember thinking, 'This is a lot of fun!'”  (Frodo:  YES!)
For myself, I do say the PCT is my favorite of the long trails, and not just because that’s what Frodo wants to hear.  But for me on the AT, I don’t think a day goes by when I don’t have a “real fun” moment.  Even in the rain.  Even on that Maine day when I fell 14 times.  And not a day goes by without me thinking, “I am so lucky, so blessed to be out here.”

We are slackpacking all day today.  Frodo dropped us off at 7:00 am.  49 degrees.  21.6 miles.  We gave her our Subway sandwich orders.  Tuna salad.  I haven’t had a tuna salad sandwich since before the trail.  Frodo is meeting us at 13 miles and then at day’s end after 21.6 miles.  Dot and Franky will then pick up the rest of their gear and hike on a couple more miles tonight to a shelter.  I’m going back into town for a last night with Frodo and Aloha is coming back with us to spend a second night with his Erwin friend.  
Our trail appetizers today – climbs, what else – were Little Bald (which wasn’t) and Big Bald (which was).  As the green tunnel lost its hold, the trees shrunk in size and then petered out, and we came to an unusual sign.  “The next 200 yards, don’t ask questions.”  Huh?  Oops, that’s a question.  We’ve read many “Don’t” signs out in the woods.  To date, the most unusual I’ve seen admonished me, “Don’t hang-glide.”  
As we walked forward, we saw long net screens for trapping migrating song birds. Then we saw field researchers – do hikers really annoy them so much that they had to put up “No Questions” signs?  Oops, there I go with another question.

Quickly we walk into a school day field trip session they are holding for a Montessori class, grades 4 to 6.  Song birds are stored in paper bags closed with a twist.  “This is a Magnolia Warbler,” says a researcher of my vintage, holding a small bird tightly in his hand.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  He bands it, measures it, and weighs it as each of the students take notes: 55 cm wing, hatchling, 8 grams.  Eight grams?  Why, that’s less than three pennies; less than a third of an ounce.  One of the students gets to release the gray, yellow-breasted song bird.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Big Bald did not disappoint.  But I know I better not get used to these 360-degree views.  The other day I wrote about some current hypotheses as how these southern balds came about – wood bison, elk, hard soil, Native Americans.  I heard another one I really like.  “They were first created by grazing woolly mammoths.”  That’s got my vote.
Yay for trail maintainers!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The three youngsters’ legs carried them ten to fifteen minutes in advance of me much of the day.  For an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon, absorbed in the Green Tunnel, I put on ear buds and listened to Pat Conroy’s Prince of Tides.  A scene between a discredited high school football coach and a tenth-grader who didn’t make the team and doesn’t have a friend at school, who the coach has been asked to work with one-on-one, nearly had me blubbering.  
I won’t describe tonight’s meal in town and I won’t describe Frodo’s and my last night before she flies back home – except to say that a bottle of Prosecco was involved.  This will be our last time apart due to the AT.  (Frodo: and I will be VERY glad to have him home in less than three weeks – knock on wood.)","Spivey Gap

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579340,"The sign at the first trailhead I passed this morning must have been up for less than an hour.  Freshly laminated and stapled to a tree, it was blunt and clear.  Hurricane Nate is coming.  “Weather Advisory.  The Hurricane Nate front could potentially bring significant weather along the Appalachian Trail…We do not encourage travel in these conditions…predicted to begin… on Saturday evening, October 7.”
That’s tonight.

It was about then that I decided to try for the Spring Mountain Shelter.  That would mean a 25.6-mile day, my longest one on the AT so far.

Once again we are water challenged.  Two piped springs were dry.  I had started out from Rector Laurel Road with over 2 liters and didn’t refill till lunch after 17 miles, at Little Laurel Shelter.  I won’t show you the bone-dry pipes, but here is a photo of the trickle from a spring, funneling onto a leaf and into my bottle.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Mid-morning I came to a sign and a fight broke out between my mature and immature sides.  That little angel on my shoulder argued with the pitchfork-wielding devil on the other.  Princesses, what would you have done?  Should my parents send me to my room, or just laugh?  I couldn’t help this.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Just before my lunch break there was a ridgeline stretch like back in Rocksylvania.  The guidebook warned it was “rocky and strenuous.”  But unlike up north, down here there was a 1.5-mile bypass.  I took the genuine AT and here’s a photo:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At my official lunch after 17 miles – how else will I make 25 miles today? – I ran into Hootenanny and Two-Stroke, section hikers who were going to close out the day here to ensure they stay out of the rain.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Fun folk.  She’s Two-Stroke because it takes two of her strides to equal one of his.  He’s a minister and when I left, he asked if he could say a blessing for my hike.  We both surprised ourselves by being very moved by the moment.  (Translation: I shed a few tears.)

All day the winds of change blew and clouds scudded across the sky.  A good number of times I reached a hand out to feel if drops were falling yet.  We had significant climbs, but the steepest were the last two heading up to Spring Mountain Shelter.  As dusk was nigh upon me, I walked up to headlights and an already coal-lit campfire.  “Scout!  I thought you might make it!”  said Dot.  The three of them gave congrats for a big day.

They and two weekenders already had the shelter filled, so I set up my tent nearby.  I was extra careful as rain was due anytime.  (Frodo: the sixth spot was taken up by a DOG!  In light of the expected extreme weather, I’m a bit ticked that the weekenders didn’t move the dog up by their heads or something, to make room for a pooped-out gray-haired thru-hiker!  Twerps!)

We are now only 11 miles from the village of Hot Springs.  It’s almost an official Nearo.  (Frodo: A nearo is generally a <10-mile day.)  I may have to pack my tent up wet, but should be able to dry it out in a hostel tomorrow.

Everyone is talking about Nate.  “Should we stay in town on Monday, too?”  Frodo’s brother sent an email: “Be careful.”  One forecast is for rain Sunday through Thursday.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579426,"With the day just minutes old I heard the awaited guest arrive.  It was 12:30 am; there was no knock on the door.  A great swoosh of wind and pings on the tent heralded his arrival.  Nate was here.
Do you know how much fun it is to take down and fold up a wet, sodden tent?  I look forward to it like a root canal.  But with everything else fully packed, and with a brief window of no rain, it was less of a pain than usual, more like having a cavity filled than a root canal.

I’ll admit to a tinge of envy of those who spent the night in the shelter.  Sure, they went out in the rain just like me, but packing up with everything dry is a luxury.

I was on trail at 7:35 and within a mile Aloha caught me before hiking on, hearing the siren call of town, Hot Springs, 11 miles distant.

“Hickory nuts,” aloha said.  He woke to find his shoes filled with hickory nuts.  The others in the shelter found similar surprises in their shoes.  “I had at least 40 in mine.”  He’d poured them out in a torrent.  “The weekenders in the shelter (Frodo: The selfish ones with the dog) thought we thru-hikers were playing a joke.”  Once again, we assumed the culprits were mice.  Storing food away.  I’d never heard of this.  I have no internet here in Hot Springs or I would look it up.  Anyone else heard of this?  Was it someone’s practical joke?

Ever have a houseguest overstay their welcome?  Nate had to just step into our trail hallway for me to feel he already had.  Nate did sleep in for a bit this morning, but by 10:00, I called out to a figure that was three switchbacks below me, “Hello, umbrella!”  There was Dot, her umbrella up for its intended purpose for the first time. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  Nate pounded the trees, “I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down!”  Dot and I gave the response, umbrellas faced into the wind, us dryshod, “Not by the hair of our chinny, chin, chin!”  Dot didn’t really say this, but as we made the last short climb and then did the three miles down, down into town, I am sure she – like me – felt a little smug under her umbrella.

Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn was a near-last-minute choice for the four of us.  The more traditional hostel here is Laughing Heart, but Dot saw that Elmer’s offers a vegetarian breakfast and I saw that they’d “been serving thru-hikers since 1948.”  Was it possible?  Did that mean?

Elmer’s is the region’s 1840 plantation house.  Two stories with two large classic staircases, high ceilings.  It’s in wonderful shape.  It’s too nice to be a hiker hostel, but it is.  
But back to 1948 and hiking history.  The answer is “Yes!”  The first AT thru-hiker, Earl Shaffer, slept here on his iconic 1948 thru-hike.  Outside MY room is a brass placard that says he slept here.  Tonight I will sleep in the same bed.  (Frodo: I hope it’s a different mattress, at least!)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j... What dreams will I have?  Will I dream of my own bed back home?

And as for the lead photo?  I have never seen a “live bait” vending machine before.  Tomorrow we’ll wake up with Nate still in our house.  They are now warning about tornadoes.  Make wise decisions.

So far Nate is behaving today.  The rain is holding off.  I have 6 miles done and another 12 to make the shelter.  
I am actually thinking about hiking straight through to Roaring Brook Shelter.  My luck seems to be holding today.  Not only is the rain holding off – is that a bit of sun? – but at mile 7, with 4 more miles of climb to the top of Bluff Mountain, I tied up with two day hikers, Matt and Jon, and then tucked in behind them.  One was a Samford University faculty member and both were ministers.

Hot Springs was down at 1300 feet and Bluff Mountain Summit, which the At goes squarely across, is 4700 feet.  If I did the math right (If I don’t, Frodo will let you know), that’s a 3400-foot climb.  But with Matt and Jon, talking about college life, then families, then the trail, we moved along.  Here’s a photo of me with Matt (blue) and Jon (gray) and three of their buddies, whom they met up with later on.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I was determined today to find out how the other side lives.  So, so often I get to the shelter or the campsite and others have been there an hour or two.  They’ve had dinner.  It’s those young 20-something legs of theirs that seem to have one more gear than I do.  But today I left at least an hour before Aloha, Franky, and Dot, and with Matt and Jon as pleasant goads, I arrived at the shelter at 3:56 pm!

Yes, I did skip lunch.  But it felt so deliciously decadent to be here, the only person, leisurely eating my late lunch.  Then at 5:00, I lay down on my pad and bag and I TOOK A NAP.  Can you imagine?  The first of the others showed up at 5:30.  This time it was me welcoming them, not the other way around.

“Hi, Franky.”

I am writing this journal entry, nearly done, and it’s 6:45.  I think it’s time for dinner.

I could get used to this.  But yes, my dear Frodo, pushing straight through for 18 miles is pushing the envelope on being “wise.”

I’ve done it.  That was enough.

Nate is supposed to throw a bit of a fit tomorrow.  We’ll see.  I’m enjoying being dry right now.

Nite.","Hot Springs, NC

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579467,"My alarm goes off at 6:30 am.  Has Nate squeezed itself out?  Was the night’s rain pounding on the shelter roof Nate’s best punch?   Is he tuckered out, or is this just a lull, and when will it pick up again?
I start packing inside Roaring Brook Shelter, and after I’d changed and pulled out the morning’s food it started.  (Frodo:  Okay, I have to tell you all why I just laughed out loud.  Scout’s “t”s often look like “f”s and he doesn’t always leave a space between words.  It looked like “its farted.”  Princess Alert! And yesterday when he wrote that he “tucked in behind” two day hikers, he actually wrote me a note that the first letter of “tucked” was a “t” not an “f”, ‘cause it sure looked like an f.) Pings, bangs, and then booming on the roof.  Dot, Franky, and Aloha haven’t budged.  It’s now 7:15 and I just lay back down.

Every morning we hear the same sad sound.  It’s so final.  It’s the whoosh of air as we open the valve on our sleeping pad.  Softness gone, hiking awaits.

Franky pulled the plug first.  The other three of us quickly followed.  We have 15.2 miles to Standing Bear Hostel, but the day’s highlight is in two miles.  Max Patch, a high bald with a 360-degree view and our first view of the Smoky Mountains.  But will we only have rain, views obliterated?

We’re moving out before 8:00, umbrellas up, and the rain lightens.  It stops.  As we approach the bald, we get glimpses down into the valleys.  When the trail bursts into the open, not only can we see to the horizon, but shafts of sunlight break through narrow slits in the clouds.  Directly on the summit, a sunlight burst hits us.  Dot does a handstand.  
You’ll be glad that I don’t have a picture of this one.  Yesterday I took my life in my hands and bought a nine-pack of Little Debbie’s sweet rolls.  Maybe I’ve forgotten about the wasp that stung my tongue when I took a bite just as it had landed on the Little Debbie’s pastry.  I only needed 7, so I gave 2 to Aloha.  When Aloha came to the shelter last night he told me I’d given him the opportunity for the first time to make a trail delicacy.  It was a tortilla spread with peanut butter, with the pastry on top of the peanut butter, then before folding it up like a wrap, you add a whole Snickers bar.  Aloha: “My favorite thing I’ve eaten on trail!”  (Frodo:  That made me laugh out loud, too.)

We stop for a few breaks, it rains a few times, just enough to break out the magic umbrellas, and we never have a real lunch.  We knew we’d hit Standing Bear Hostel mid-to-late afternoon and the finest of frozen pizza awaited us.

And truth be told, it was the finest frozen pizza I have ever had.  They have an actual pizza oven – not wood fired, but one solely used to cook pizzas.  And the pizza was brimming with cheese, not the stingy amounts usually found on a frozen pizza.  (Frodo:  Not sure where Scout become such an expert on frozen pizza.  It has never been found in our freezer.)  I finished two-thirds and the rest is for lunch tomorrow.

A mile before Standing Bear, Aloha gave out a yelp.  “I yelled like a girl!”  (Frodo:  I think everyone yells in fear about the same.)  Take a gander at this photo to see why. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
(Frodo:  And Scout included this random photo of something scary looking - maybe a baby crawdad?)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
At the hostel, Dot and I passed Josephine back and forth.  John Reed who works here named his guitar Josephine; she had a soft action and a fine sound.  They have a washtub bass, too. http://www.trailjournals.com/j... 
Tomorrow morning, before even three miles pass, we will enter our last National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We will repeatedly climb over 6000 feet. I’ll hit Gatlinburg in two days, where my son Sean will hop on the trail with me again.  I think this odyssey may be done in two weeks.  Oh my.","Roaring Brook Shelter

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579503,"Thirteen hundred and sixty-three hundred.  That’s today’s low point and high point.  We have a 5000-foot climb.  Woo-hoo!  That’s right, woo-hoo, not boo-hoo.  We are going to sleep at almost 6000 feet and better yet, we are entering Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Last night at 3:30 am it was 66 degrees.  Daytime it has been in the 80s, well into the 80s.  I have my 30-degree sleeping bag and my down puffy jacket.  
As I hike the first five miles of the climb, sweat soaking my shirt, the cold weather gear in my pack feels like a jilted suitor, like we threw a party for cold but nobody came.  Don’t they know we’re getting deep into October?

“Six.”  No, not for me and Frodo.  The “six” is for Dot.  Tomorrow she could begin her journal entry with “six.”  She will have six more days left to complete the trail.  Last May Dot hiked the southernmost 140 miles of the trail and then jumped on a bus to Maine.  We all hope to celebrate with her next Tuesday.  And the rest of us will have a bit over a week left.  Is that really possible?

BEAR.  Decent sized, four to five years old, my Great Smokies welcome.  My sixth bear, about 40 feet away.  At the mid-day shelter where I had planned to have my lunch, I moved on instead.  It was this sign.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
As I rose high, the sun ducked in and out of the clouds.  And higher still, we were inside the clouds themselves.  The temperature dipped, and dropped some more.  In the afternoon it was eminently comfortable.  At dinner, I put on my long underwear top and bottom and just before heating my hot chocolate I broke out my down puffy.

Today the map said there was a plane wreck and the twisted metal was still in evidence three miles before the shelter.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  The pilot missed clearing the ridgetop by only 75 feet.

We have had double-deck shelters, but never one like this one.  The lower level doesn’t even have two feet of headroom.  Six others were already set up on the top level, so Dot, Franky, and I are like three sardines in a can.  We’ll all have to be real careful not to bang our heads.

Tomorrow we have 15 miles and then it’s the road we take into Gatlinburg.  As Dot said while trying to get down a bean dinner that from her look was less than appetizing, “Tomorrow, town food!”

This sardine is signing off.","Standing Bear Hostel at Green Corner Road
",Tri-Corner Knob Shelter,"Oct 11, Wed",18.40
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579546,"It would be hard to imagine a starker contrast from this morning to this evening.  This morning Dot, Franky, and I woke crammed like sardines in a tin.  If we rose on an elbow, we risked barking our head on the platform right above us.  (If you can bark your shin, can’t you bark your head, too?)  Our bathroom was a near-open-air outhouse, our pantry was our food bags hanging twenty feet in the air on bear cables.  Any luxury?  Why, yes, there was a spring 20 feet from the shelter with clear, clean water coming out of a pipe.
And this evening?  I write this sitting in a Baskin Robbins in Gatlinburg, a chocolate chip milkshake with sprinkles at my elbow.  Across the street is a garish Ripley’s Believe It or Not, an airbrush tattoo parlor, and to get there I’d have to brave sidewalks chock-a-block full of pedestrians akin to New York City crowds, and testy, tourist-filled cars backed up and going less than 5 mph, when they would like to be going 20 mph.  I do have a full TGIFriday’s meal in me, so I’m not complaining, just sayin’.

But how can I be writing about any of this when the Smokies put on such a show today?  So often we hugged a knife edge, the ridgetop only a foot or two wider than the trail itself.  On either side the mountain top dropped off sharply.  It might be scary, but only rarely could you see the precarious drops.  We had views of line and lines of mountains, fog in the valleys, the “smoke” for which these mountains are named.

Our goal was a trailhead 15 miles from the shelter.  We had arranged for a shuttle driver to meet us at 2:00 – given the terrain, the views to take in, and the hordes of people for the last five miles, meeting that goal would be a reach.  I was expecting people, but not people in take-a-number hordes.

In this same stretch I was hoping to find a “message in a bottle.”  It had been left last May.  Actually it was a message in a Ziploc baggie.  It was hidden for me by one of my Scout co-leaders, from back when I was a Scoutmaster in the ‘90s.  Jerry had been the Scoutmaster before me, and he is still an Assistant Scoutmaster.  He and his wife had hidden the message under a stone at the base of a hollow tree, 15 feet from a trail junction sign.  Unfortunately, his description of the junction’s location was off by 3 miles, but with the sign’s picture and with  Dot and Franky’s help, we found the sign.  Now I must tell you that on the PCT multiple people hid messages for us and we found fewer than half.  But here, Franky pointed, “There’s the hollow tree.”  And there was a stone in it.  Barely sticking above the ground was the corner of the Ziploc bag.  The bag was mud-caked.  A small crowd had gathered by now.  Was the note still legible?  I gingerly opened the bag.  It was.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
As I began to read, 8 to 10 people gathered around.  “We’ve been told that if you’ve done the PCT, the AT is a piece of cake.  Was it?  Hope you are doing well…”  Jerry and Barbara.

“A piece of cake,” that line got a big laugh.

And as for my answer, well first of all, a big thank you to Jerry and Barbara for leaving out this slice of cake to spice up our day.  The AT is no piece of cake, nor is it a cakewalk.  My two prior trails, the PCT and CDT, did prepare me to endure those parts of the first 500 miles that were some of the most brutal stuff I’ve ever been on that called itself a trail.

In Ken Burns' classic PBS “Civil War” series he featured a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a Supreme Court Justice who served as a young soldier in that war.  Holmes said, “In our youth, our hearts were touched by fire.”  I have felt similarly about my AT hike.  In the “youth” of this hike I didn’t even want to find the words to tell my sister that I was only averaging 1.5 or 1.3 miles an hour.  I only finally communicated to Frodo a glimpse of how hard it was through some photos:  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
In the youth of my hike, my heart was annealed, was touched by fire.  Everything since that first 500 miles I see through that lens.  Sure, the 6500-foot elevation gain two days ago was difficult, but it was an actual trail, not canted granite slabs that are wet and slippery, where I have to grab at trees for handholds.  But those granite slabs and rocks, that country where I fell so often, remain stamped on my soul.  That’s why you often read of my joy hiking these last 1500 miles.  A part of me remains surprised, as moment to moment the trail tread remains so civil, so sane.

I hope I hold on to that appreciation forever.  To feel the exhilaration of trail slip under my feet at a rate of two or two-and-a-half miles per hour. 
Jerry and Barbara, no it hasn’t ben a piece of cake, but the times when I bite down on rocks are so many times overmatched by the moments near impossibly exciting – Bear! Rattlesnake! A wasp bit my tongue! – and overmatched by those moments impossibly sweet  - getting to the shelter by 4:00 pm, holding Frodo in my arms.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579571,"8:01 am.  Franky: “I haven’t slept in till eight in four months.”  Maybe our bodies are telling us something this morning in our motel room.  The time draws near for this to end. 
Dot and Franky are really “doing” the town.  The Aquarium, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, and miniature golf are on their agenda.  It’s a joy to see them having so much fun.  Though how the heck did a fully grown sawtooth shark  find its way to Gatlinburg?  (Frodo: ???)
When we hike out tomorrow, Dot just has four hiking days left.  So yesterday I thought to pass on to both Dot and Franky some long-trail wisdom.  I can’t take credit for this, it comes from my hiking buddy Rolling Thunder.  At the end of his PCT hike eleven years ago, RT gave this advice.  When you need to go pee, start waiting 15 minutes instead of stepping aside and going right away.  It will help prepare you for the realities of civilization.

Rolling Thunder, by the way, is doing well and is maybe a week or so behind me.

Fire.  I’ve written about the near-complete lack of charred trees or brush on this trail.  Gatlinburg stands in stark contrast.  Almost a year ago, on Thanksgiving weekend, a major forest fire threatened to engulf the town.  I look out from my balcony and I see empty foundations where homes once stood and I see multiple steep hills with charred trees.  The fire must have come at the town from all sides.  
Late this afternoon Sean arrived. It’s great having our son with me again.  With his car we can finally do our laundry.  The hotels do not have washers and dryers for public use, and the laundromat in town burned a year ago.  The nearest one now is three miles away.

Take a look at the amount of clothing in this dryer.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  At your home, what fraction of your wardrobe would this be?  For us, this represents all the clothes for three persons.  All.

Finally, I must say good-bye again to a pair of friends.  They’ve traveled nearly 500 miles with me.  “The shoes are dead.  Long live the shoes!”  Frodo sent me a new pair of shoes and I must discard the old.  A hole had developed in one of the insoles that is so large I can stick my finger through it.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579622,"Once again, just like in late June, Sean’s first day on trail with me was great, full of character, and way, way challenging.  I don’t intentionally set out to put my son through the wringer.
But we are hitting the AT’s high point today, Clingman’s Dome at over 6600 feet, and aiming to hike 24 up and down miles.

The Newfound Gap trailhead parking lot must hold over 150 cars.  When we arrived before sunrise, before 7:30 on this Saturday morning, the lot was full.  We joined the throng watching the sun rise.  I captured the photo above.

Sean and I took off, Dot and Franky shortly afterward.  I knew we had a long day ahead, so I tried to keep my interactions with oncoming hikers crisp and efficient (Frodo: That must have been difficult!)  That worked for the first 7.5 miles; at Clingman’s Dome three big related families cornered and peppered me with questions.  Two had been to Philmont and are Eagle Scouts, and two of the kids want to thru-hike.  My resolve to hike on quickly melted like butter on a skillet.  I loved their enthusiasm and I loved telling stories.  Thanks, Duncans, Kentons, and Zenders.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Sean and I would pay for that 20 minutes later that day.  We lunched efficiently at 1:00, taking closer to 40 minutes than my usual hour.  But already, counting on my fingers, I could tell we might end up night hiking in the dark.  Actually, the only other time I’d really done that on this hike was – drum roll, please – with Sean three months ago in southern Maine, 12 states before this one.  Sean, I really don’t set out to reserve night hiking for you.

The Smokies teased us with views through the increasingly bare trees.  We came across a really big blowdown:http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  As we hit mile 20, four more to go, at 6:00 pm, the terrain grew tougher.  We ascended Rocky Top.  The sun set and we hiked on till we overtook another group of hikers with headlamps already on.  Ours came out then, too.  It took us another half hour to reach the shelter.  Thankfully, thankfully, there was room for us.  It was a double layered one, but this time with plenty of headroom on both levels.

Sean and I set up, cooked dinner, and joined a convivial group of eight around a campfire.  (By the way, Dot and Franky are not here and we’re not sure if they’re behind or ahead.)

At the campfire a fellow mentioned that he thru-hiked the PCT in 2006.  “What’s your trail name?” I asked.  “Thor.”  “We’ve met before,” I told the now-incredulous group. I had hiked south from Walker Pass bringing Trail Magic – a tall Fosters beer – to Rolling Thunder, “and you were the first northbound hiker I met.  I was jealous; we both were wearing the same hiking shirt, but mine was brand-new and white as a nun’s habit, and yours had 600 miles of trail cred!”  Thor knew Rolling Thunder well and we had so many other hiker friends in common.  What an unexpected and fun hiker coincidence.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
It’s now long past hiker midnight.  Sean is sleeping the sleep of the exhausted next to me, and I should do the same.

Who knew I’d run into Thor again, eleven years after a ten-minute trail encounter, and now we feel  like such close old friends. Thanks again, my son, for joining me on this journey.  Tomorrow will be easier.  I promise.","Gatlinburg

Yesterday I crossed from 1999.9 miles to 2000.  Why didn’t I write about it?  For one thing we were on a mission.  But more so, there was nothing along the trail to mark it.  Once again, we SOBOs are chopped liver.  I had thought to perhaps assemble a marker, as I did for 1000 miles, but every minute spent would be another minute of hiking in the dark.  But I hadn’t come completely unprepared.  I had had Frodo send me a metal tin, about the size of two decks of playing cards stacked one on top of the other.  Inside I’d put 120 of the “AT” temporary gold tattoos.  This note was taped on the outside:

2000 miles!

Congratulations, SOBOs!

Please take one and whoever takes the last, please pack out the tin.  Scout.
Sean and I took a “second breakfast” break around 11:00 am, including a short nap.  Then at 1:00, just after The Devil’s Tator Patch, we took a lunch that was oh, so leisurely.  All our climbing was done.  Next we would descend from 5000 feet to 1700 feet and Fontana Dam.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

I can see my breath.  I can count on one hand the number of times during the last five months that I could see my breath because of the cold.

I wore my down puffy jacket during lunch today and kept it on all afternoon, even when I was climbing.  For my first time on the AT, tonight my hot dinner had cooled off before I could finish it.  The prediction for tonight is 37 degrees, and that’s for Fontana Dam, nearly 2000 feet below our elevation.

This morning there was a big climb right away after Sean dropped us off.  2000 feet of gain.  I didn’t notice it.  I don’t remember it.  Mona and I talked the whole time.  She might say she was drafting off me, as I led the way those six miles, but I’d call it a reverse draft, as I was carried along so easily as we volleyed life stories like ping-pong talk.

Mona got picked up after those six miles for a pre-arranged resupply.  We’re all hoping she’ll catch up for Dot’s big completion celebration tomorrow night at Nantahala Outdoor Center.

Dot has a surprise awaiting her tomorrow night.  The three princesses have made her a crown.  It should have arrived at the Outdoor Center today.  Franky doesn’t even know yet.

At one point Mona got me talking about my legal career (Frodo: as opposed to your illegal one??)  Yes, if you didn’t know, I had a full career as a lawyer before becoming a writer.  And I was a kind one, lawyer that is.  And I’m not being funny.  I started making an illusion to “Perry Mason” and then, realizing that  my audience was in her twenties, I added, “L.A. Law.”  (Frodo: which ran on TV from '86 to '94, so not much better!)  But Mona said, “I know Perry Mason.  My middle name is Perry.  I was named after him.”  I have no recall of ever meeting a Perry before, much less a twenty-something named after Perry Mason of long-ago television fame.  If Mona is pulling my leg, I don’t want to know.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

On and off all morning, Dot would think of it and her eyes would moisten.  “I can’t believe it!”

Both Franky and I could feel her energy.  “This is your last climb, Dot.”  Thirteen hundred feet up; respectable.  At the top were her last bald, her last big views.  There were ten other hikers there, all admiring the view.  They all fussed over Dot when Franky and I told them these were her last AT thru-hike miles. 
One hiker started doing yoga stretches.  One of us exclaimed, “Let’s do a hiker yoga class!”  (Me.)  Dot, I, and a gentleman who could have passed for Yul Brynner in “The King and I"" went through four poses – Child, Eagle, Warrior II, and Triangle – and then another woman started casually correcting us and leading the next pose.  With a cluster of 15 people, what were the chances that we’d have a certified and licensed yoga instructor among us?  Yep, that’s what she was.  Here are the three of us styling.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
We took our time.  Franky called out, “Four miles left.”  “Two.”  We could see the Nantahala River moving swiftly below, hear the roar of rapids.  “One.”  Dot said she would be finished when she crossed the bridge.  Franky took video and I took the stills as she mounted the steps to carry her over the water, carry her to a spot where a much younger, in so many ways, but very determined new college graduate had stood, pack on her back with 10 days of food.  Dot stood in the same spot again, five months have passed, so many adventures, so many memories.  She raised her poles.  I snapped the photo above.

Before moving on with the day, let me give a Shout-out to the Jamie Simmons family who were up on the bald.  A music professor and his wife with a set of teens who still had big smiles at the end of a hiking trek.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
The Nantahala Outdoor Center has a world-class kayak slalom site on the eponymous river, as well as two restaurants, an outfitter, a store, a bunkhouse, and cabins.  It was the site of the 2013 World Championships.  To me it will always be the site where Dot finished.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579743,"I am in a fire tower with every bit of the view I expected to get from Clingman’s Dome, the AT high point, and didn’t.  Three hundred and sixty degrees.
Green sward mountains surround us, undulating ridgetops.  I’ll take a picture (left), but it will at best give you an aftertaste, a hint of sitting 50 feet in the air on an open platform, a 3000-foot climb under your belt, and only 130 miles to go on the Appalachian Trail.

Ahh, but before we leave the topic of my birthday (yesterday), I owe you one more story.  I story from my birth day, the day I was born.

It was 1951 in a small whitwashed hospital in Culver City, a one-high-school small town tucked like a bunion on the Pacific-Ocean-side toe of megalopolis Los Angeles.  I was the first child of Don and Micky Mann, the highly-anticipated first grandchild of my three living grandparents.  It was a difficult labor and the doctor was late in arriving.  “Don’t push.  Don’t push.”

Now it’s a commonly-known fact that just-born babies are both beautiful amd ugly as sin, with squished faces, resembling British Bulldog Winston Churchill.  My father Don, His mother Fay, and my mother’s parents Ted and Esther had been waiting for hours.  They’d heard noises that sounded like screams.  This was decades before fathers were allowed to be present for the birth.  When the doctor arrived I quickly followed and they practically rushed me to the observation window, not yet cleaned up, so that my father and grandparents could see that I was fine and a boy.  Grandma Esther tool one look at me and my squishy Winston Churchill face and exclaimed, “He looks just like Don!” (my father and her son-in-law)

Today I am proud to say people see a strong resemblance.

The rest of today was as great as that fire tower view.  I almost feel like we’re making a long walk now to the graduation stage.

This morning’s 3300-foot climb rose up into the belly of a thick cloud and then over a few hundred yards I burst into vibrant sunshine.

In the middle of the day Mona caught up with me and then later in the afternoon we tied up with Franky, Aloha, and Funky Duck.  Here we all are together: http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Twice today hikers came up to me with a big smile and “Hello, Scout!”  Norm had stayed with Frodo and me before his 2012 PCT hike and Wet Dog stayed with us in 2015.http://www.trailjournals.com/j...       http://www.trailjournals.com/j...    
There was a sobering note on trail today.  “Danger – Fire-Damaged Trail.”  This was the first time in 2000 miles that I’d hiked through fire-ravaged forest on the trail.  It felt like Southern California mountains.  But I was impressed with how quickly they’d rebuilt sections after last fall’s fire.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I am cowboy camping tonight.  The stars are out, visible through branches now bare of leaves.

Tomorrow I will hike 8 miles and then Dot in her car will pick us up to go to the town of Franklin.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579776,"It dipped well into the 30s last night.  Franky got a photo of frost, so you don’t have to take my word for it.  Under the stars, yes stars, snug in my 30-degree bag, even my bare toes were warm.  My down jacket was stuffed away in its sack; it’s in reserve, reinforcements should it get even colder in these remaining days.
I made my three short night hikes, at 11:30 pm, 3:00 am and 5:30 am; this is normal for me.  I heard one of the three young bucks camped near me get up twice to relieve his bladder.  I confess I felt glad – this isn’t just the curse of sixty-plus-year-old men.  And, yes, Princesses and Reuben Scout, I am talking about peeing.  (I know you just wanted to hear your dad say “pee.”)

It was just over 8 miles to the road into Franklin, NC, and the trail felt crowded.  Over those 8 miles I passed at least 15 hikers heading in.  There was no more evidence of yesterday’s forest fire burn.  I’d heard dogs baying in the distance and then I overtook four hunters.  This is the third day of bear and wild hog season.  They were tracking wild hogs.  “They can get over 300 pounds.”  He showed me his special-purpose Garmin GPS that indicates where he is and where each of his dogs is running in the forest.  I wonder what Daniel Boone would think of all this.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
And just to make the morning complete I climbed a quarter mile off trail, straight up.  “Surely this is the AT.”  Oops.  But my reward was a great bald with one of the best views in Tennessee.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Once in town, our $60 motel room, shared by 4 of us, didn’t come with access to any town clothes.  I hadn’t sent my bounce box here; in fact, I sent it home with Sean from Fontana Dam.  I really wanted to wash all my trail duds.  So I marched two blocks from the motel to the thrift store.  I walked out with the finest pair of forest-green shorts and shirt that 67 cents can buy.  (Frodo: Aren't you going to SHOW us?)
Dot wants to join us tomorrow night at a shelter one mile from the road.  She has a car!  She can do that!  And she’ll drive us to the trail early tomorrow; we won’t have to hire a shuttle driver.  But that means over a 23-mile day for us tomorrow!  I have my Dollar General resupply done and have refreshed my stock of toilet paper.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579814,"It is 7:25 am, 46 degrees, long enough before sunrise that the sky is still suffused with grays only, no pink or orange.  We are deep into October and I’m in Dot’s car, warm motel bed a memory, one more in an impossibly long string, as many seemingly as the roots and rocks of the Appalachian Trail.  Once more to the trailhead, this time at Winding Stairs Gap.
While I’m still in the car, I better get something off my chest.  It took me till the third phone call of the day to tell Frodo.  This was a sentence I’ve never said to her in 40 years.  Without any segue or preamble, I paused and then just said it.  “I am sleeping in bed with another woman tonight.”  
Did I just hear a pin drop out there in the silence of you reading this?  
What did Frodo do?  She sensed my embarrassment, first chuckled and then we both laughed.

The two-bed motel room with four hikers of both sexes is a trail phenomenon common enough.  “Don’t sleep on the floor, Scout, we’ll share the bed.”  In truth, we sleep closer together when we're sardined into most shelters.  Yet at age 66, this was a first for me and I was often self-conscious.  I turned over less frequently and I was aware of when she did.  I…miss…Frodo.

Somewhere about ten miles into the trail today, about 11:30 am because I was booking, I became a two-digit midget.  I was looking hard on the trail for any sign.  I should know by now that there would be nada.  Where were the letters in stones saying, “100 MILES LEFT!”?  Nada, nothing.  I celebrated by myself – Aloha, Funky Duck, Mona, and Franky must be ahead.  I wanted to be at the shelter 23 miles along well before dark.  This time I wouldn’t construct a monument.  But I felt imprinted deep inside, “I have less than 100 miles left!”

I’d planned to push to 16 miles for lunch at the Carter Gap Shelter, around 2:00 pm.  But at 1:00, at an unmarked overlook with a glorious view, there were Aloha, Mona, and Funky Duck having lunch.  There was only one thing to do.  And I did.

The trail tread was great today except for 200 yards of downhill that was trying to channel Maine.  For the first time in months I grabbed a strong sapling to swing myself down a 5-foot drop.  Funky Duck said, “I actually used a hand to grab a rock to lower myself.”

With two miles left to the shelter, there was a small bald atop Standing Indian Mountain.  Dot was jogging up the trail toward me.  “What’s wrong with this picture?”  She parked a mile beyond the shelter and hiked in with her sleeping gear and !! sodas, wine, raw materials for s’mores.  But then “I got antsy, Scout.”  So she jogged two more miles up the trail.

Here’s Aloha, Funky Duck, and me on the Standing Indian Bald the moment an alien tractor beam struck us and lifted us to the heavens. [Frodo, insert a snarky comment here.] (Frodo:  What?? I haven’t even seen the photo!  Maybe it actually happened!  And besides, when do I ever make snarky comments??!!)  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
This evening I sat at a perfect campfire that Dot and Mona lit, roasting the perfect marshmallow.  See the photo above.
At the campfire we were joined by a most convivial quintet: Lucas, his dad Terry, Nathan, and Terry.  (Frodo: Okay, I can’t help myself.  I think you mean a quartet, since there are 4 of them.  And are two of them named Terry, or did you goof?)(Ah, in your tiny handwritten notes about the photos, I think it says the second Terry is really William.)  We reveled in answering questions about our hikes. http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579850,"Every time on this hike that I heard a particular two-word phrase I would shush the speaker.  I’d raise a single finger to my lips.  Silence.  I’d freeze them with my eyes.  Then I’d look around, my knuckles poised.  Soon they’d hear a sharp rap of knuckles, as I knocked on wood.  We’d exchange a knowing glance.
“Triple Crown.”

The Pacific Crest Trail.  The Continental Divide Trail.  The Appalachian Trail.  America’s “Triple Crown,” nearly 8000 miles of trails.

Hike all three and you’re a “Triple Crowner.”  I never thought that would be me.

More people have flown in Outer Space than have completed the Triple Crown.  Now I am on the verge.

I left camp with Mona at 7:45 am.  Franky, Dot, Aloha and Funky Duck had hardly stirred.  In my pocket were the keys to Dot’s car.  She parked at a trailhead a mile south.  We made quick work of that downhill and offloaded more than half our gear into her vehicle.  Dick’s Creek Gap, 17 more miles ahead, is our goal.  It’s the location of the Top of Georgia Hostel, where we’ll resupply and stay the night.

Four miles along we hit this signed trail.  I’m just going to let it speak for itself.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
You may have noticed the absence of a “countdown.”  There has been no “six,” “five,” etc., as I count down the days until Frodo comes.  That day is synonymous with the end of my hike.  Frodo’s arrivals I’ve greeted with unparalleled joy.  My hike’s end will cause a welter of feelings.  Touching the Springer Monument Plaque, it will not be the pure simple joy of Frodo’s first touch.  Joy, exultation, poles thrown in the air, tears, the beginnings of grief.  One life will have ended.

I am enjoying today for what it is.  A countdown simply feels inappropriate.  
I see a sign ahead after 8 miles.  Mona is there.  It strikes a deep chord in her.  Mona, a Georgia resident, has now walked home from Maine.  Here I am in the photo above, entering my last AT state.

It’s Saturday and we pass people like we’re at a county fair.  Two troops of Boy Scouts, one of 12 and the other of 40.  I have only seen groups that large hiking in a line on trail in old photos.  Till today.

We saw more and more evidence of damage from Hurricane Irma, and a commensurate amount of sawdust.  Almost all the hundreds of blowdowns have been cleared.

For months it feels like we have been seeing “Keller and Keller’s Dad” in shelter registers.  We were always two or three days behind.  Tonight they are here.  Keller just graduated high school and his Dad has been on the last two months.  Dot said, “A big section.”  Keller’s dad said, “It’s huge!”  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
As I sit here in a nice hostel kitchen and bunkroom  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I can’t help but think of last night and what tomorrow night will bring.  Last night I cowboy camped and every time the wind blew, tree parts, twigs and leaves, fell on me.  Tomorrow night they predict the start of a rain storm that will dump at least 2 inches of rain.  We will see.

I am about to pick up a hostel guitar.  All is good.  No countdown.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579886,"You just got to love technology.  If this were 1995 and I were on a weeklong backpack trip with my Boy Scout troop, I’d know it’s cloudy and feels like it might burn off or it might rain.  But this is 2017, so I know there is 0% chance of rain today, that the rain will start at 2:00 am tonight, and that the lowlands are expected to get a torrential two inches of rain on Monday, but that the estimate was just notched up to a Noah’s Ark deluge of three inches.  And that’s for the lowlands.  The AT will be a lot worse.  You know, maybe I wouldn’t mind if it was back in ’95.
Three inches.  Sheesh.

A marathon is 26.2 miles.  I’m going to just leave that to sit and perk for a while.

We have two near-thousand-foot climbs, but I am more aware of the cut-away, cleaned-up blowdowns.  We would have been repeatedly slowed to scramble over and through these tossed-about criss-crossing blown-down trees.  But just like the parted Red Sea (Frodo: Boy, we’re really into Biblical references today!), a chain-sawed path littered with sawdust is open for us to pass easily and swiftly.

It’s a Sunday, but we see way fewer hikers than the near hordes of yesterday.  But I did have three interesting encounters.  Going to get water 11 miles along, not long past 12:30, I came upon a large Korean family out picnicking.  They nearly adopted me.  The few who spoke English explained what I am doing to the others.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I had a quick efficient lunch with Aloha.  We had done the math.  Three inches equals one heck of a lot of rain.  If we push on one more shelter than planned, only an additional 7.6 miles, then tomorrow we’d only have to do 11 miles in the rain to reach shelter, instead of 18 miles.  But what that meant for me was a 26.2-mile day, a marathoner’s distance, my longest day on the AT.  
I knew it would mean night hiking by headlamp. 
In the afternoon I ran into Kermit (trail name) and Kermit (the Frog).  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Then I ran into a hiker who stayed with us in 2015 when she did the PCT in 2016 (Frodo: huh?) and whom I last saw three months ago on the AT.  Footsteps had been southbounding, but now she’d jumped down to Springer and is hiking north!  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I must report, and it is with sadness, that Dot and Franky have left the trail.  Franky flew home from Atlanta today.  He’d hiked all this southernmost 700 miles last year, so in a way for weeks we’ve had the pleasure of his company on borrowed time.  As for Dot, she finished the trail nearly a week ago, and it was time for her to begin the car journey home.  I am so glad that the hostel last night had a guitar and the two of us got to hand it back and forth one more time, trading songs.

This is only the start of good-byes.  I can’t wait to say hello to my Frodo, of course, and to my sister Shelley and brother-in-law Nahum, who are flying out to meet me at the end.  But the good-byes will be hard.  Aloha, Funky Duck, Mona.  And especially to a two-foot-wide strip of granite, roots, and dirt.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579928,"On the floorboards of the shelter we are sandwiched together tighter than the patties on a Big Mac.  (Frodo: Okay, that analogy just doesn’t work.  You guys are squeezed together side by side, not on top of each other – I hope.  And it’s been decades since I had a Big Mac, but I believe there is an extra half of a hamburger bun between the two patties, so they’re not really that close.)  The rain – consistent, steady, and loud – has been falling for hours.  I just got back from my 4:30 am pee (what fun in the rain) and write this in the dim red glow from my headlamp, set to disturb the others as little as possible. 
I’ll go back to sleep now and see what the dawn ahead will bring.  (And Frodo is right, “I haven’t had a Big Mac in 20 years,”  [Frodo: Now that’s just creepy.  He wrote that in his journal two days before I ever read it and added my comment above!]  But, my dear, I know a juicy metaphor when I see one.)

It’s almost four hours later, after 8:00 am.  It alternates between raining hard and raining harder still.  Mona is dressed and she just used three full coffee packets crammed together to make one super-shot dose.  I will set this down, unhang my pack, and make myself a two-hot-chocolate single cup.  But a poor imitation of Mona’s zinger.

I hike out at 10:00 am; wow, is that possible?  Aloha’s phone shows the yellow of deluge everywhere.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  I walk out and unfurl my trail super power.  It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s umbrella man!  
All too soon my socks, gaiters, and shoes are dripping, soaking wet.  They must weigh twice their normal weight.  The rain sounds like a whole marching band’s worth of snare drums, all their sticks beating a machine-gun clatter on my umbrella.  The wind blows gusts from the side and I grip the umbrella with three points – two hands and my head jammed up between the struts for support.  The AT is giving me a rousing “Hurrah!  Don’t forget me, Scout!”

The trail is now a stream and at times more a cascading waterfall.  At 12:30, in quick succession, the rain changes to drizzle, it stops, blue sky breaks out, I shout for joy.  I reach Neels Gap at 4:00, get a bunk and towel, and resupply one last time.  In the store I meet Neels Gap Outfitter staff Alpine (AT this year NOBO) and Holy Diver (AT ’16) (Frodo:  Your sister Shelley and I had a hard time reading the second half of the second name, and we didn’t think “Holy Divan” was correct.  Then Shelley looked online and found red-bearded Holy Diver there.  Ha!).  They love the tattoos when I hand them out.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

Thor walks in, looking for me.  I met him on the PCT in 2006 for 15 minutes and then again two weeks ago in the Smokies when my son Sean was with me.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
After I arrived, Aloha, Funky Duck, Cauldron, Keller, and Keller’s Dad came in.  It’s almost an AT SOBO convention with six of us here.  Keller’s Dad sat down next to me and told me a very moving story which I’ll try to share in the next few days.  Cauldron showed me the reason that he’s called “Cauldron.”  His pot, compared to the rest of ours, is as large as a cauldron.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...

It’s supposed to drop to freezing tonight, but it’s already cold.  On the climb up Blood Mountain I shed my down jacket and long underwear bottoms, but the moment the wind picks up I wish I had them on again.

I am nearly constantly thinking back on the events of this hike.  My first day, 14 miles straight on the Maine/Canada border, sinking to mid-thigh in a bog.  Sploop.  It seems like an age ago.

If the AT had one more rainstorm to throw at us, I am so glad it was yesterday, not today.  On our allotted three daily views, the sky was clear and we could see well into the lowlands.  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
I know the end is close.  For one thing, I woke up at 4:15 this morning and started to make a list of items for the upcoming CDT Coalition Board meeting, and a list of research avenues I want to pursue for my New York Press CDT book.  The manuscript is due Jan 15th.  Yikes!

Just when you think the trail has squeezed out all of its surprises, at a trailhead at mile 12 I knelt down to remove a pebble from my shoe and a car pulled up behind me.  “Are you a thru-hiker?”  I was concentrating on the pebble and raised my other hand.  I heard car doors opening.  OH MY.  It’s Franky and BUCK!  And Franky’s dog Summer.  Franky flew home on Sunday, was there for all of 9 hours, then drove 17 hours south, picking up Buck along the way.  Now he was at this obscure trailhead, 20 miles before Springer.  Men and dog are going to hike and finish with us.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579984,"The sun rose. The sun set. Just another day. But no day on the AT is just “another day.” Exceptional. All of them. But today is Exceptional among exceptionals.
Today I finished the Appalachian Trail. Today I was reunited with Frodo. Today I am a Triple Crowner. How’s that for hitting the trifecta.
Since last October, I’ve worn a pendant around my neck. It’s an AT emblem. It’s numbered. There are only 500. Mine is 383. They are supposed to change hands, be given to someone who has helped you in an extraordinary way. I’ve only ever seen two others. I scoured the internet and found no other instance of someone giving one away. But mine was given—first to Joan “Bump” Napolitano by two AT hikers she’d helped on the PCT and then last October she gave it to me. The die-stamped diamond-shaped pendant has rested near to my heart. Deep down, since the moment I first joyously put it around my neck, I knew I had to give it away. But I didn’t want to ….  http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
In Australia they measure how cold a night is by whether it is a “one dog,” “two dog,” or “three dog night.” Last night was cold, down to freezing, lower. It must have been a “two dog” night. Literally. Franky slept with his golden retriever Summer and Mona’s friend Hollywood slept with her big black lab puppy. Both said their dogs shivered. But in sunlight today, the measure will be tissues, not dogs. Will it be a one-tissue, three-tissue or ten-tissue day? The tears will fall as surely as the temperature fell last night. In fact, just before noon, the first words my sister said when she, her husband and Frodo greeted us three-quarters of a mile from Springer’s summit were, “Don’t start crying now.” She wanted me to save it for the summit. Fat chance of that. I buried my head in Frodo’s shoulder.
When we crested the summit and saw the end-of-trail plaques, there were day hikers mingling about. They didn’t realize what was about to unfold. “Why is that silver-haired man crying?” High fives. Pictures. Crowns came out to be put on heads. We wore smiles like a king's jester, smiles wider than Lewis Carroll’s Cheshire Cat.
 But there was something I had to do. “Let the crown wait for a moment. Please come here,” I asked my wife. My sister started filming. I told them all about the Appalachian Trail pendant--I have only seen three. I know of no others that have changed hands. I clutched it tight as I told Frodo, “I want you to be the first to know who this is going to.” I told her about the man I tried to give it to a thousand miles ago. “He gave me the keys to his car. He gave me shorts and a t-shirt so I could wash my sweat-stained clothes. He closed his hot dog stand to drive me around. But when I grasped the necklace cord to give it to him, he reached out and physically stayed my hand. Mitch already knew what it took me another 500 miles, all the way to the Shenandoahs, to realize. This pendant belonged to someone else. It was never mine to keep. My privilege was to carry it for 2200 miles. The necklace was destined to belong to the woman who was the first to say, ‘Scout’s hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2017.’ It belonged to the woman who sent me dozens of food packages, who flew out seven times to see me.” Here Frodo started sobbing. “This necklace is yours,"" I said to her as I lifted it over my head a last time and put it around her neck. 
 Now it was time for crowns. Now it was time for the champagne. Now for the fist bump with Franky, Aloha, Funky Duck and Buck. The day hikers wanted our pictures too. “Congratulations!” “That’s amazing!”     http://www.trailjournals.com/j...    http://www.trailjournals.com/j...  
Afterward, I walked down the 8.8 mile AT approach trail with Frodo. We started to get used to the idea of being around each other without the other leaving soon. Used to life without having to say, “Make wise decisions.” I played tunes from my iPod shuffle 63-song power mix for her. “You need to know how much these sustained me when it was so tough Maine..” I played my all-time favorite song. It’s not on my power mix. I have not listened to it for ten years. “Why not?” she asked. “This way it stays my favorite,” I answered. It’s on the Who’s album WHO’S NEXT. It is Baba O’Riley.  At the end of the approach trail, after climbing down the 604 steps alongside stunning Amicolola Falls, I walked through the arch that marks the beginning for so many, and for me the end, of their Appalachian Trail hike. Frodo caught the moment. I am wearing the ""International Appalachian Trail"" hat given to me five months ago by Carol and Kirk, IAT trail maintainers who helped set Rolling Thunder and me off on our journey at the Canadian border.      http://www.trailjournals.com/j...       To have Shelley and Nahum, my sister and brother-in-law, here was way more than icing on the cake. There is no substitute for being present, for showing someone else you are so important that you will fly across the country to be there, experience that special moment as it happens. I’d asked Shelley beforehand to practice with her smart phone video camera, hoping she could catch my giving Frodo the pendant. She did so and that night Shelley exclaimed, “Look at it on Facebook,” as it went from one hundred, to two hundred and then double that in “likes” and the scores of comments mounted. Shelley had just retired. Maybe she has a second career ahead as a film maker.   http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
This day could not have been better. It ended with an all-you-can-eat buffet at the Amicolola Falls Lodge. It ended with the princesses getting a photo of me with the Crown they had made. It ended with me in Frodo’s arms in bed. It ended with me thinking back to a skinny thirteen-year-old boy, not even 80 pounds, carrying a 35-pound pack, drenched every day by unseasonably cold Sierra rain, wishing for a soda, but falling in love for the first time. With the outdoors. With backpacking. Backpacking would give that boy his soulmate, his wife. Frodo and I went on our first backpack together before we went on a first date. What would that boy think of me today? That was probably thirteen- or fourteen-thousand hiking miles ago. I think he’d be frightened by that prospect but then he would smile. He had so much to look forward to. And he still does. What's next? What wonderful thing will be around the next bend?

 The summit of Kala Pattahr is 18,514 feet. Frodo and I hope to stand on it in three weeks. Does the number 18,514 really mean anything to us now? Can we begin to feel what it will be like to be four thousand feet higher than we’ve ever been before?
This is a BIG bucket list item for my Frodo. But her path to this one has been strewn with boulders. Five months ago, she was wearing one of those big, black, nearly-to-your-knee, ugly boots. It was on for five weeks. Two months ago she woke up with shooting back pain—someone else had to tie her shoes. And three years ago she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. I just got up to hug her and tell her, “I really admire your attitude, I admire everything you’ve done, the lengths you’ve gone to getting ready for this trip.”  
As for me, it’s not the elevation that keeps me up nights. The last month we’ve made three trips up high, spent eight nights sleeping at or near 10,000. On two trips we hiked above 12,000 feet and on the third I summitted Mt. Langley, 14,050 feet.  
What worries me? Actually I feel sheepish, silly and embarrassed about it. I’m still wrestling with it. Will it be okay if I share it in another entry?

 In the meantime, let’s get my inner five-year old spinning cartwheels again.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604090,"Frodo here.  As we did for our 2007 PCT thru-hike, we will be keeping a joint trail journal for our Himalaya trek.  Not sure if we’ll both write entries for most days or if we’ll alternate days; we’ll have to see as we go along.
 When Scout finished the AT a year ago and had earned his Triple Crown, people would ask him what his next trail would be.  His answer?  “Whatever Frodo wants.”  What a guy!  So I, of course, jumped right in to dib him for a trip to the Himalaya, which has been #1 on my bucket list.  I figure I need to do the more strenuous bucket list items sooner rather than later, since I’m not getting any younger.  That includes a trip to Patagonia and hiking hut-to-hut in the Alps.
 That doesn’t mean I have to do everything myself.  I don’t feel I have to prove anything to anyone – I’ve thru-hiked the PCT for goodness’ sake! – so I am not above having someone else carry my stuff.  We’re doing this trek with a small group through Wilderness Travel.  They deal with all the logistics (often a real hassle), schlep our stuff from lodge to lodge (we can bring 33 pounds each!), and cook for us.  We’ve been happy with their pre-trip service and have heard good things about them, so we’re hopeful it will be a well-run trip.
 Our group will include one other couple, who are from Flagstaff, and three solo hikers – a guy from Aspen, a woman from near Sacramento and a woman from Virginia.
 We’ve been reading some books and blogs and notice in the online photos that, even inside the Sherpa lodges, everyone is really bundled up.  Also, we are told we won’t have access to laundry facilities on our 3-week trek.  So we are pretty much using our weight allotment to bring lots of layers and extra longjohns.  I hate being cold, so hope this works out.  Guess I’ll just have to get used to having less-than-pristine underclothes.
 Although those of you reading this journal likely know us as Scout and Frodo, on this trek we plan to be Barney and Sandy.  The 5 other folks in our group won’t be familiar with the long-distance hiker community and the tradition of trail names.  Plus we’ll be eating and staying in Sherpa Lodges with other groups and individuals and I can just imagine the confused looks as Scout calls across the common room, “Hey, Frodo” and it’s apparent he’s talking to me.  It also feels a bit presumptuous; like saying, “We’re special; we have trail names and you don’t!”  So, Barney and Sandy it is.  Hope you’ll adjust okay.","Home

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604152,"“Stalkers!” 
---The Princesses, Reuben Scout, Connie, Ranger Duck, Rolling Thunder and the Mysterious Five, go to the Himalayas.
The email accusation was raw. “Stalkers!” The nasty barb was directed at us. At us? What had we done? Why had our trek unleashed an internet troll?
People. In 2007, on the eve of our first thru-hike, Frodo knew what to expect. The trek highlight would be the spectacular scenery of the Pacific Crest Trail. The views and natural glory. Five months later, when we finished, she’d be the first to admit she’d been wrong. The trek highlight was the people. Period. By far. No comparison.      
Our PCT hike is already eleven years ago. I am 66 years old. My brain acts like my aging Apple laptop. The hard drive is so full the gigabtyes slop over the side and the memory acts glitchy. Our PCT trek was five months long. But I can tell you a story for each and every single day. Multiple stories for every day. So often, the reason is the people. 
People. We haven’t even started our Himalaya trek and someone has made me cry. Not the “Stalker,” but a woman named Connie. I don’t know her last name. I don’t have an email address. I had posted my first trail journal entry just hours before. You know me, how much I put into this journal, what it means to me. I’ve written on prior treks that, “It’s as important to me as my feet.” When I put up the first Himalaya entry, I hadn’t told anyone and it felt like I was writing into a vacuum. Then an email came:“Trail Journal Guest Book Entry.” Someone had read my first entry. Someone cared enough to write in the Guest book. I held Frodo’s hand and we read the first entry together: “YAYYYYYY! Another Scout journal!!!”  Thanks so much, Connie. 
The Princesses, Rueben Scout and Ranger Duck: Picture a father and mother reading bedtime stories to three delightful little girls. Then switch from The Little Engine that Could to our Trail Journal. On my CDT hike, the princesses were in kindergarten, 2nd and 4th grades. I’d do “Princess alerts” in my journal to their parents—don’t read this. Such as when I talked about farting, or a girl who got a mosquito bite on her vulva. Oops, Princess alert! But today the oldest is 8th grade and the littlest, Jessica, has a big dictionary vocabulary and she dishes out four-syllable words like popcorn. 
Ranger Duck: The Princesses can’t come along, so they sent Ranger Duck. He’s a yellow bathtub duck in an official Park Service hat. He’s afraid of heights. 
Reuben Scout: SunWalker was a 20-something 2007 PCT hiker who we got to know well. Well enough that when he announced he was getting married in New Zealand, Frodo immediately announced, “We’re going.” We did and watched him get married in his tux wearing his hiking shoes. Now he has a seven-year-old, Reuben. Like the princesses, every night SunWalker read my AT journal to him every night. He started calling himself, ""Reuben Scout."" They just sent me the latest photos of Reuben. I am printing it out and Reuben will come with us too. 
Rolling Thunder: “Stalkers!” The accent is Kiwi. I can hear the voice from the email. We know this troll. Why is Rolling Thunder calling us out? Because in all the randomness of the universe, our good friend flies into Kathmandu two days after us. Wait a minute, doesn’t that make him the stalker? We have exchanged itineraries and on the opposite side of the world, at a place that is 12 hours and 45 minutes ahead of Pacific time, Scout, Frodo and Rolling Thunder will try to meet up. 
Who will our “people” be this time? Our trekking group total is seven. Who are the mysterious other five? Soon we will know.
…All my bags are packed and I’m ready to go. Frodo and I fly in a few hours.

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604232,"What am I afraid of?    
The bear the size of Volkswagon on the Pacific Crest Trail? He’d reach me in a heart beat. Literally. They sprint 30 miles an hour. He could gobble that twenty yards between us in just over one second. I reached for my camera and got off two shots. Every fiber was alive. Was it stupid not to be frightened? I wasn’t.
“Are you carrying a gun?’ Every long distance hiker gets that one. I don’t fear mountain lions, bears, bull moose or elk. Okay, I do have a healthy fear of rattlesnakes and of skunks. But I lose sleep over none. I’ve never dreamed and woken concerned. One of my remaining hopes and trail dreams is that in my lifetime I will see a mountain lion in the wild.    
Heights? No. I’ll see if I can find that great picture Rolling Thunder took of me on Mt. Katahdin’s Knife Edge. Lightning? I probably should. On Mt. Taylor, barely off the 11,000 foot summit in my tent, bolts shot, fifteen, twenty to the minute. They were so close together that I couldn’t tell which flash of light went with which clap of thunder. I was elated, shouting for joy and hollering out praises to the seamstress who’d sewn my tent. (Z-packs—Joe, thank whoever was sewing your Hexamid Duplex around four years ago).
On the PCT my greatest fear was back-to-back days of freezing rain. Would I crumple? Leave the Trail?  
What am I afraid of? Why is this trek different from every other trek? Again, just as I said the other day, it all boils down to people.
On the CDT three years ago, I hiked alone for over half the distance, 1500 miles. On the AT, I was alone a lot. When I did hike with others, we still felt extremely independent. I was free, just like a bird reacting to wind currents as I chose. As for hiking with Frodo--the entire PCT and 600 miles of the CDT—we were a partnership. The pair of us out there is its own kind of raw freedom.
What I also loved was that almost always, I had a reserve. Maybe it’s left over from my Scoutmaster days. When I do hike with others, I watch the edges. I’m on the lookout for signs--Is someone hurting physically or mentally? Whether they know it or not, they become my pack, they’re under the shelter of my wing.
How will I feel being the sheep? In the Himalayas I will be in someone else’s flock. I’m used to carrying my own weight. I carry others’ if they need it. Here I’ll carry a day pack and porters will haul the bulk of my gear. I feel almost embarrassed to share this with you.  I feel petty. A good hiker friend, “Why Not,” looked me in the eye a few days ago, “Scout, that’s how the porters make their living. They like it when you bring more weight. There’s more work to go around.” I like being the one who comes to the rescue. I like being the lead hiker or the tail end Charlie. Gosh, I’m whining, aren’t I? 
But why do we go out? We go to get out of our comfort zones. Into the breach I go once again.
I’m writing this on a layover in Canton. They’ve just called our flight to Kathmandu.
Thanks for listening….

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604272,"We are here in Kathmandu after a long flight on China Southern Airlines.  Our first leg was about 15 hours, from Los Angeles to Guangzhou, China.  That’s a LONG time.  After a two-hour layover, we flew 5 hours to Kathmandu.
 Some impressions of the Guangzhou airport:  They make you go through a passport check and security check even if you’re making an international transfer, but the also have a health check.  They make you pass one by one through s scanner that senses your body temperature.  I assume that if you have a fever there are some consequences, but I don’t know what those are.  Do they have a quarantine hotel there?  Do they send you to a hospital?
 The photo is of an area of the terminal that includes a couple of gates.  There is lots of open area, much more than in any US airport I’ve seen.  There was a children’s play area in another part of the terminal, too.  Everything looked really new.
 Getting our visa and our luggage in the Kathmandu airport took a while.  Unfortunately, one of our two duffels wasn’t here.  The baggage folks were able to tell us that it’s still in Guangzhou and should arrive this evening.  Wilderness Travel picked us up and said they’ll take care of picking up the duffel.  Yay!  Nice to have someone competent and local dealing with these kinds of things.
 Traffic in Kathmandu is crazy!!!!  Lots of cars and motorcycles (driving on the left side of the road), with lane markers either  non-existent or virtually ignored.  No traffic signals, but traffic police at a few intersections.  Pedestrians seemed to take their lives in their hands crossing the street. But our WT guy, Kihm, laughed at my aghast-ness, so I guess it must work for them. 
 The Hotel is very nice, with beautiful grounds.  We had an orientation with our fellow trekkers in the gardens.  Everyone seems to be very congenial, which is good since we’ll be spending the next 3.5 weeks together.  We learned that our group of 7 hikers will have about 20 support people – A trek leader and 3 Sherpa assistants, a cook and 4 kitchen boys, and about 12 porters.  Wilderness Travel has a special arrangement with some of the  lodges, whereby they get to use the lodge kitchen and cook our meals for us.  So many support people seems overly decadent and rather guilt-inducing, but we keep reminding ourselves that this provides needed employment for them. 
 We all had dinner at a tourist-oriented dinnerhouse.  It was great.  We got to try many different traditional Nepali dishes (including our first mo-mos, really good!) and we got to watch several traditional dances, from different regions of the country.  Really interesting! I thought the hand motions in a couple of the dances looked a lot like hula.
Tomorrow we have a full-day tour of the city.  Prepare for sensory overload!","Home

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604367,"I went to Europe and I took with me.....  It was a children's’ game. It could’t hold an candle to Milton Bradley’s  monopoly or  to hula hoops. There actually once was a time when mini vans didn’t have video screens in the seat backs, and in fact’ there once was a time when there weren’t mini vans. What did kids do? We’d play “slug a bug” and we’d play “I went to Europe and I took with me...” for hours in the car. “I went to Europe and I took with me an apple.” The next person would add something that began with the letter “B.” I went to Europe and I took with me an apple and a book.” And on and on, first you’d recite the list from memory and then add one more item in alphabetical order until one person, under the weight of all the items, couldn’t recite them in order from memory. “You’re out.” You played till the last one standing. 
I went to Nepal and I took with me …”. The photo is what’s in my 33-pound limit gear bag. That’s more than three times my backpacking baseweight. And I’m not packing a sleeping bag, pad or tent. What are you carrying, Scout? I am also carrying around a six-pound day pack in addition to those 33 pounds. Scout’s gone wild. I can’t bring myself to write out the list. The photo is above.
Today, the seven of us loaded into an van, toured Kathmandu and were very, very, grateful. We were grateful none of us were diving. Motorcycles zoomed in and out like swarming bees. It was more like amusement park bumper cars. We saw the tallest Buddhist Temple in southeast Asia. You can only walk around it in one direction. There were prayer wheels the size of pick up trucks. You only spin them clockwise. You only use your right hand. It is good luck. I’d walked a  20-foot circle around one, spinning as I went, and as all that good luck flowed in I Iooked up and my group was gone out of sight, “I’m lost!”  Scanning the crowd, I thankfully spotted one familiar back. Whew.
Yes, we are jet-lagged. So far we’ve managed not to take it out or on the other, I better keep on spinning prayer wheels.
This morning, we discovered that our ATM card wouldn’t work. I actually reached Chase, our bank. They said, “Not us.” We need some 80,000 rupees, mainly to tip our guides and porters. “ Do it in Kathmandu,” we’d been advised. Wrong. They must have been spinning their prayer wheels in the wrong direction. We tried different ATMs but to no avail, which was how I found myself in the upper floor, corner office sitting across from the head of IT for 74-branch Sanima Bank. More on the next entry.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604368,"Sandy: Long day. We had to meet in the lobby of the hotel this morning at 5:00. We set the alarm for 4:15, since we needed time to check our suitcase into the hotel's storage (they'll hold it for the three weeks that we'll be gone - nice!) and then check out of our room. Of course we woke at 3:30 and realized we wouldn't get back to sleep. So we got an earlier start than planned. We flew in to Lukla early this morning, on the 6:20 am flight. So all day it felt like it was a good 2 or 3 hours later than it was. The jet lag didn't help, either.We hiked only 6 miles today, lots of ups and downs, with net loss of several hundred feet. We crossed a couple of the big metal suspension bridges that make me really nervous. I can't look down and I have to frequently touch the cable with my right hand. The more people there are on the bridge, the bouncier it gets. And the bridges are really long. They don't seem to bother the yaks, though, or the donkeys. I feel lucky that we've never been halfway across when a group of yaks starts across going the other way.Our room tonight is surprisingly nice, with our own bathroom and flush toilet. The mattresses are quite nice and Wilderness Travel provides two good sleeping bags for each of us. Here's our room for the night: http://www.trailjournals.com/journal/photos/21828/1190535 We spent the evening hanging out in the common room between teatime and dinner. Very pleasant.
Scout: The Flight to the World’s Most Dangerous Airport—We are so many sardines packed tight into the fourteen-seat Twin Otter, straining to claw its way into the air. The thin attendant has to push hard, squeezing past knees up the aisle. She hands out one thing. Cotton. That’s a new one. Hands shove cotton deep into ears. If you had loose fillings, you’d be seeing your dentist when you got home.
Frodo points out the window. BIG mountains. She’s as excited as a five-year old ready to blow out the candles on a birthday cake.
One passenger leaned way into the tiny cockpit. The pilot wasn’t annoyed. He takes his hands off the controls, points out mountains and leans far over so Kim from our group can take her pictures.  You have love small planes.
The Lukla airport comes rushing up like it’s going to smack you in the face.  We bounce once and head straight for the concrete barrier at the end of the short runway. The props scream like a boiler factory. The ten-for high letters  above the crash barrier read’ “WELCOME TO LUKLA.” We’re here.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604405,"Scout: At 6:00 am there is a knock on the door and there are Panang and Mingma serving us hot tea. If this is life as a sheep, I guess it is okay. Yesterday, as the sun came out on the trail and I stopped to strip off my outer jacket, Panang reaches to help me. He helps pull it off, put it in my pack and then lifts the pack back on to my shoulders. I was being helped by a 24-year-old who has summitted Everest seven times.
 What’s it like on the trail? It’s as if we walked into the pages of National Geographic. One moment we are passed by a yak train, massive horns missing us by a foot or two, bells tinkling like cows in the the Swiss alps. Porters pass with worn wicker baskets with pads. The weight would stagger me. It could be a scene from 100 years ago. Then a cell phone rings and one of them pulls it out and starts talking. 
We hike in a deep river valley, the tree-clad walls rise precipitously, looking like an 18th-century Chinese woodcut. Every hundred yards or so it feels like there is a hole-in-the wall tea house, until they all disappear for the second half of the day. They are built of cut rocks, about the size of three bricks, each takes a man a full day to chisel.
Our flock is seven. Watching over us are 1 cook, 3 Sherpa guides, 4 pack yaks, 2 yak handlers,  and1 lead guide. At all times on the trail, four are watching seven. So Lisa had to work pretty hard to get lost. For nearly an hour.  
How? She was walking between the lead three of us and the tail group of three. When the lead group stopped for lunch, Lisa blithely walked on by. One Sherpa fast walked uphill and one down hill. She was 20-minutes and a 750-foot climb up trail. We gave her a standing ovation when she returned. Her reward? After lunch she got to hike it again.
Bathrooms: We actually had an attached bathroom with a regular toilet last night. Lunch was another matter. It was a rotted wood shack, gaps in the slats, the tin roof held down by rocks and the working end of the facility was a one foot by two foot gap in the floorboards. And what came out our bodies flowed straight to their garden. How about that, princesses?
And yes, I’ll get back to the banker story soon. Tonight we are in Namche Bazaar. We climbed over 3,000 feet today. Don of our group says this will be the highest he has ever slept. Frodo and I will have to wait a few more days to say the same. We stay here two nights.
Frodo: okay, I give up. We really aren't Scout and Frodo on this trip, but Scout is insisting on using those names for this journal, so I guess I will, too.We climbed a LOT today. During the morning Scout kindly stayed back with me and Lisa East. We've dubbed our two solo women, both named Lisa, Lisa East (Virginia) and Lisa West (California). Lisa East and I are the two older, shorter women and we're a bit slower than the others, especially on the steep ups and downs, since they involve lots of big rock steps. Anyway, Scout took off with the other four after lunch. Alas, I fear I've lost him to the speedy group for good.I appreciate that the WT Sherpas never make me feel pressured or hurried. The lead Sherpa, Pemba, is the sweep and he seems perfectly fine with going our pace.Our room for tonight, in the Himalaya Culture Home, is much like our room last night. We arrive and find our beds all set up and our duffels delivered. Tea time is at 4:00 pm. How civilized!

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604432,"Frodo: We woke up to glorious views of amazing mountain peaks. We stepped out the door of our room as our morning tea was being delivered and our jaws dropped. We have five rooms for the seven of us and they all open on to a large balcony/courtyard. On both sides were drop-dead gorgeous views of mountains, with the last of the clouds thinning to nothingness. Right in front of us we can look down the valley we climbed up yesterday, very green with steep walls.I'm not sure we mentioned it, but yesterday was pretty cloudy and cool. It wasn't a big view day anyway, so we didn't fret. Today was a good day for clear, sunny weather.Today has variously been referred to as a ""rest day"" and an ""exploration day"". We did some of each. During the morning we climbed (didn't we do enough of that yesterday?) to a great view point near the National Park Headquarters, then climbed lots more (up many obnoxious big stone steps) to an even better view point at the Everest View Hotel. We sat on the balcony there and had drinks (non-alcoholic ones), which felt pretty decadent. Pemba told us that there is oxygen in each of the rooms, since Japanese tourists often come up by helicopter (two landed and took off while we were there) without acclimatizing (or is it ""acclimating""?). I could see spending some of our kids' inheritance to do that in 15 years or so.After our lunch of pasta with tomato sauce plus sautéed bok choy, cucumber salad and a donut-shaped Tibetan bread (good and hot - yum!), we all headed down into town to do a bit of shopping. Scout and I ended up with an eclectic mix of warm gloves for Scout, buffs for both of us, an adaptor for the outlets here, a bag of dried cranberries (to help keep everything moving), and a couple of candy bars. I looked without success for an eyeglass strap and a jacket that would be lightweight, easy to get on and off, a color I like, and cheap. Not like I'm fussy or anything. Nor could I find herb tea. Heavens.A buff is a long tube of lightweight material that you put around your neck and then pull up to cover your mouth and nose. It helps keep you warm, but it was strongly recommended by Pemba to keep dust out of our respiratory systems and avert the ""Khumbu cough"". Not sure how I'll like it, especially when I can barely get enough oxygen as it is, while climbing up the steep trail.Scout: I walk out the door of our tea house room into a second story patio. Boom. It's like a thunderclap for the eyes. To my left, two sets of glacier-clad slabs of mountains. And when I turn right, my gosh, if the three princesses were here they'd be squealing. In your face, huge, grey and white, rock and ice, scimitar blades of rock unsheathed. Frodo, these are the BIG mountains you wanted. And it will only get better from here.At the end of the ""rest"" day's 1,400-foot climb, we had a great view of - Frodo how could you not mention it - Everest, the mother of mountains herself.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604446,"Scout: In the dark of a Nepal night I make my way to the bathroom three or four times. Peeing. No it’s not just because I’m 66-year old guy. Staying hydrated out here is the difference between keeping on trekking or being forced off. So I pee. How do I make sure I don’t bang a knee or bark a shin? Every night my grandson lights the way. 
In the dim light of the screen saver a photo of my eight-month-old grandson lights the way. (Now I don’t have to turn in my grandparent’s license. I have a legitimate reason to show you his photo.)
It was another sunny day. We know not to take this for granted. We could be climbing, sweating just as much and all this movie set, shangri-la could be hidden, covered by a veil of clouds.  
Back home you’ve driven through small towns where it felt like there was a church on every corner. Here the Buddhist Monasteries are few and far between, but every one hundred, every fifty, every twenty feet on the trail there are sacred Mani stones. Ming-ma makes sure that we always pass these on the left side, moving clockwise, the one way. Tibetan prayers are carved in to the living stone. Pemba, our lead Sherpa, just told us as I type this that there are no more Mani stone carvers. The art has been lost.
Pemba says there is no movement at present to preserve or relearn the skill, though they do try to preserve the stones.
From Thame, todays’s destination, we went on a field trip this afternoon. We climbed to 13,000 feet to the Thame Monastery. The building felt almost carved into a sheer rock wall. Inside, a lead monk with a basso profundo voice chanted prayers with a dozen other monks. We entered with shoes off and sat cross-legged. It could have been centuries ago. 
We sleep at 12,500 feet. In two more nights I will sleep higher than I have slept before.     
Frodo:  True confessions:  I was the only one of our crew of seven who did not hike up to the monastery.  Even though it sounded like a cool field trip, Lisa East said the hike up felt like a death march, so I have no regrets.  It’s not easy for me to admit, but I am the weak link here.  Not a position I am used to being in.  Even Lisa East, who I think is a bit older than I and almost as short, hiked somewhat faster today than I did.  Barney stayed back with me some of the time and Lisa was with me some of the time, but some of the time it was only very-patient Pemba and me.  Ouch.  In trying to figure out why I get so fatigued going uphill, I think a big part of it is the size of the steps.  For someone as short as I am, anything taller than a standard step is tough.  And the difficulty seems to increase exponentially with the height.
Anyway, I’m hanging in there and I am very much enjoying other aspects of the trek - particularly the extraordinary views and the great company.  No one has made me feel at all resented or anything less than respected.
Okay, that’’s enough blubbering.
This evening a Sherpa spent some time with our group; he lost the tips of his fingers and toes while working on Everest.  Now he paints and he sells his paintings and cards that feature his paintings.  We all gave him some business; Scout and I now have a card with a picture of the Tengboche Monastery and lots of native animals (including a cute Yeti).  When you reflect on how the mountaineering industry has affected the Sherpas,it seems that much of it has been negative.  Most of the people who have died on Everest and other Himalayas peaks, most have been Sherpas, working to help Westerners and others to attain their goal of reaching the summit.  I wonder what their feelings are on the subject.","Namche Bazaar

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604496,"Scout: At breakfast this morning another trekker at the tea house said, “I was eyeing you and Frodo last night, but I thought it was impossible.”  Strawberry Pop had stayed with us on April 27 a year and a half ago and successfully thru-hiked the PCT. “Scout! And after hugs he came over to our group and exclaimed, “Do you know you are with trail heroes?”  Life is wonderful and amazing.
Before we came out here we heard an awful lot about the Khumbu Cough. Our friends Colleen and John said buy two bottles of cough syrup in Kathmandu. I did. On our first day hiking up out of Lukla a third of the folks heading down wore face masks. Trail dust mixes with yak dung and cooking fire woodsmoke. It doesn’t seem to affect Frodo (Frodo: at least of YET, but we’re only starting our fifth hiking day.), but it has grabbed me by the tonsils. You know how I love to talk and tell stories. I carefully ration out my talking time. I sneak sips of cough syrup like a drunk hoarding a paper bag of Red Dog. I bought a face mask in Namche Bazaar two days ago and am wearing it religiously. I look like a misplaced cowboy on the dusty plain. My cough is getting a little better. 
So let’s talk dung. Dung, dung, dung. (princesses, I did that so your parents would have to say dung a bunch of times.) When you walk on a rock-wall-lined lane in these villages don’t casually brush your hand against the wall. Instead of hard rock, you might brush yak dung. The walls are just a great place to dry the fresh dung. Don’t try this at home. Tonight we’ll sit by a warm stove fueled by dry yak dung patties. 
Finally, I am going to disagree with my wife. Yesterday, she was faulting herself for not keeping up with the lead group. But let’s take a look at those four, Ted, Don and Kim and Lisa West. Three of them live over 7,000 feet, and all year they hike and exercise even higher, and the one who lives near sea level like us, Lisa West, she runs triathlons for gosh sake. So, my dear Frodo, if you show up ten minutes later after a hard steep climb, that’s something to be proud of, not some thing to denigrate yourself about. 
Frodo:  My humble husband is neglecting to mention that HE is usually in the lead group, at almost 67 years old and living at sea level.  Ha!  But I did do better and feel better for most of today’s hike.  
I’m not sure we’ve ever explained what route we are going on here in Nepal.  There is a typical trek from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (EBC) and we are doing that.  But Wilderness Travel adds on extra stuff.  So from Namche Bazaar we hiked for a day west to the town of Thame, where we spent last night.  Tonight we are in the town of Kamjung, a bit north of Namche.  Tomorrow we re-join the hordes on their way to EBC.  We’ll take a few more days to reach EBC, then we do more extra stuff. [Scout’s turn to try a snarky comment: Extra Stuff! That’s what you are calling Kala Pathan, at 18,500 feet? That climb some folks call the the hardest in their life?] We’ll head over Cho-La Pass to Gokyo, then back down to Namche.  There’s a good map among our photos posted for today.","

Scout: The furry beasts were covered in a thick layer of frost this morning. If John Denver were here he would have written a song with the first line, “There’s frost on the yaks, and the Sherpa tea is strong ....”
Frodo is looking at me like I’m strange, but then she gets a good idea. After dinner each of us will add one more line. We’ll see if we get a Himalayan top-forty hit. 
Actually I am avoiding mentioning today’s hike. Two thousand feet down and then two thousand feet up. It is very, very nice to be looking back on it. If on the Appalachian Trail the path was “roots and rocks,” here it is “rocks and rocks.” You have to keep your eyes riveted on the ground. When you do sneak a peek away from the trail, the views are gorgeous.
I hope that Frodo won’t edit out this paragraph, but I have two challenges for Jessica, the youngest of the princesses. Apparently she has gone on a dictionary rampage ever since I wrote that when we visited a few days before she left, Jessica was speaking almost exclusively in four-syllable words. The first challenge is to send me a complete sentence composed of words all more than four syllables. The second one is to find a four-syllable word for poop. Excrement has only three syllables.  
We are in Tengboche, at nearly 13,000 feet. Tomorrow is my birthday. I bet that my mother never thought that in a thousand years any of her children would celebrate a birthday in Tengboche, Nepal, heading to Everest Base camp. We are never too old to give our mothers a few new gray hairs. Thanks for having me, Mom  
Frodo: Though 2000’ down and 2000’ up was tough, we got here to Tengboche by noon.  After lunch scout and I took a nap, then had tea with our group at 3:30.  At 4:00 most of us took the short walk to the monastery, the largest in the region with over 60 monks.  They started a ceremony at 4:00 that included lots of chanting, with occasional episodes of drum thumping and blowing of horns small and twelve-foot long.  Aspiring mountaineers (probably headed to Ama Dablam) came to be blessed by the monks and that was interesting to see.  Our good friend Rolling Thunder will climb Ama Dablam in a couple of weeks; I wonder if he’ll come here to be blessed.
Our room for the night is the smallest so far and this is the first time we’ve had a shared toilet.  In two days we have a rest/exploration day.  I’ll do the former, Scout will do the latter.  I’ll spend some of my time explaining what a typical day is like and what a typical lodge is like.  
Like most nights on this trek, I expect I will sleep vey well tonight.  Exhaustion tends to do that to me.","Khumjung

Pemba has taken us on a little-used high path to Pangboche. But if you spun me around five times, like in the game pin the tail on the donkey, and asked me what trail I was on, I could just as easily have answered, “We’re on the Appalachian Trail.""
One of the day’s photos shows seven-year-old Reuben Scout with the Everest ridge in the background as if he was here. He isn’t. He is with his parents in New Zealand. When he saw the first photo we sent of his cardboard cut-out high in the Khumbu, his dad SunWalker wrote and said, “The expression on Reuben’s face was better than on Christmas morning.” They recorded a short video which we picked up today with three interesting facts: Reuben’s parents both have the same birthday, Sir Edmond Hillary was also from their New Zealand (we did know that), and Hillary and Reuben’s parents all three share the same birthday.
Today’s hike, some five miles with mildish ups and downs, was called easy by Pemba. True, and yet nothing near 13,000 is “easy.” We are staying two nights here in Pangboche. I will admit that our rest/exploration day has me a bit daunted. For “rest” we are climbing 2500 feet to Ama Dablam Base Camp, where we will “picnic” at over 15,000 feet. Tonight we sleep at over 13,000 feet. It will be they highest I have slept. Tomorrow, as I pass though 14,500 feet I will stand at the highest point I have ever stood on the face of this planet Earth.
Frodo: Today is Scout's birthday. I notice he neglected to tell you that. Today he is 67 years young. He is the oldest of our group by more than 5 years. I think everyone sees how well he's doing and is encouraged. ""Maybe I can still be strong and adventuresome when I'm that age!""
I brought a birthday card for him (that's a bit worse for wear), let him use my really nice pack towel after his shower, and gave him lots of affection today, but I did not schlep in a gift. I hope we'll have a date night to celebrate when we get home.
Pemba and the staff and our new friends went out of their way to make the day special for Scout. Everyone wished him a happy birthday at breakfast. Then at dinner, Pemba gave Scout a card that everyone had signed. There were cloth napkins, wine in real wine glasses, and roast chicken. But the piece de resistance was a lovely cake with yummy chocolate frosting and candles, that they turned all the dining room lights off to bring in all lighted up. We sang Happy Birthday and the group here from Spain sang a Spanish version as well. I hope he felt celebrated and loved today.
Make sure you check out the extra photos we are posting. The best way to see them is to click on the lead photo so it becomes larger, then use the 'next' and 'previous' buttons to see others. Unfortunately, those seem to be reversed, at least on my iPad. 'Next' takes me back in time and 'previous' takes me forward in time. We'll post some more photos, including some from the birthday celebration in a little while.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604598,"Frodo:  Scout is off hiking up 2200 feet to Ama Dablam Base Camp with the rest of our group and I, having decided that it would be best if I harbor my strength for the big days ahead, am staying at the lodge to rest.
So let me tell you about what a typical day is like for us.  At 6:00 am two Sherpas greet us with cries of ""Good morning"" outside our door, then make us cups of hot black tea with a little sugar.  Breakfast is at 7:00, but we dress and pack up by 6:45 because the Sherpas appreciate it if they can start loading up the yaks a little early.  They take our duffels and stuff our double sleeping bags.  Until we get to the lodge this afternoon, we have only the clothes we wear and what we've put in our day packs.  My day pack is rather small.  That's good because it can't be too heavy, but it's difficult to shove my jacket in.  It's hard to know what to wear because conditions change with the time of day, whether we're in the sun or not, whether we are going uphill or down or both.  Plus you feel bad stopping to make clothing adjustments and making at least some of the group wait for you.
Breakfast starts with  porridge of some sort --oat or wheat or corn - or muesli with warm milk.  Then we each get a plate of some sort of eggs, some sort of bread, and usually some sort of potato.  Very filling.  Pemba makes good coffee and there's hot water for tea or cocoa or hot Tang.  Then after running back to the room to use the toilet one last time, we set out up the trail.
We often hike as a group for much of the morning, with Ming-Ma in the lead and Pemba as sweep, and Pasaang or Jomba somewhere in the middle.  We stop occasionally to drink water, use the facilities (sometimes a bush), and rest a bit.  
Sometimes we only hike for the morning and we reach our lodge by lunchtime.  Other times we stop at a lodge for lunch.  In either case, our cook and the four kitchen boys have schlepped all the kitchen stuff to our lunch spot after quickly cleaning up breakfast, and now they serve us a hot lunch.  Lunch is carb-heavy (potatoes, pasta, rice, or breads), includes some vegetables (sautéed peppers or green beans), and a protein (salami or chicken or tuna).  We also get hot Tang of some flavor and hot water.
When we arrive at the lodge we're shown our rooms, where our sleeping bags are laid out and our duffels have been dropped off.  So far, all but one of the lodges has provided attached private bathrooms, usually with a non-enclosed shower.  (We're told that the next several lodges will have shared bathrooms and a separate shower you have to sign up for and pay for.)
At 4:00 we have tea time.  We can have Sherpa tea (tea with milk and sugar) or hot water.  (Our kitchen staff brings all our own dishes, food, condiments, tea bags, and drink powders from lodge to lodge.). We also have bowls of popcorn at tea time, as well as crackers and slices of yak cheese, which is surprisingly good.  Instead of cheese and crackers today, we get cinnamon rolls.  Somehow the cook is able to make cakes and breads without a real oven.
At each lodge, the cook and kitchen boys work in a spare workroom or in a tent.  Sometimes they have to carry food and dishes quite a ways between the cook area and the dining room, where we have a long table reserved.
Before dinner at 6:30, we are given hot wet scented washcloths for our hands and faces.  Dinner is much like lunch, but it includes a bowl of soup and also dessert of some kind.
We usually hang out together for a bit after dinner, but we're back to our rooms by 8:30 and generally asleep by 9:00..  We sleep pretty soundly, though Scout and I have separate beds.
Then 6:00 am rolls around again...Scout: It is10:33 am. My phone gps altimeter says 14,770 feet. It is the highest my feet have ever carried me on dear Mother Earth. Whoo Hoo. And I still have another four hundred feet to climb on our day hike this morning.
Picture in your mind what a big mountain base camp should look like. Picture what the climb up to it should be. Ama Dablam Base Camp fit the bill in both particulars. You have to earn your way there and the 2200 foot climb Was exactly that, the first half of it every bit as tough as climbing up Mount Katahdin last year, except we are 10,000 feet higher. And base camp was an array of grouped tents with prayer flags in the shadow of a mountain that looked to me every bit as impressive as the face of El Capitan in Yosemite. 
What is the Guinness Book of Records for the highest a rubber ducky has been on the earth? Princesses can you find out? Here is a photo of Quacky at Ama Dablam Base Camp, 15,200 feet.","

Scout:  This is the continuation and ending of the banker story I started several entries ago.  We will also do a trail journal entry for this date. It was over a week ago that I was in a banker’s corner office. Frodo and I knew we needed tens of thousands more rupees, but no ATM would recognize our Chase card. It was almost after hours, but the two Wilderness Travel folks had a friend in Sanima Bank’s executive suite. We called, took a taxi, arrived and were ushered into the third floor corner office, winding our way past lesser functionaries. I was offered tea. Birkram Shrestha, Head of D-banking and IT, greeted me like family. I heard that the 74-branch bank had installed the first ATM four years ago. We quickly discovered that we were both guitar players. Except Bikram has actually been a pop star. We pulled up and watched one of his pop-star YouTube videos. Bikram and his second-in-command, Manoj Ghimire, and I all became Facebook friends right then and there. He repeatedly assured me, drink your tea, we’ll work this out. I wondered what Frodo was thinking back at the Hotel. Was I lost? I’d been gone over 90 minutes. Finally, some secret sign was exchanged and I was taken by Manoj to a special ATM. Smooth as silk. Rupees poured out like a winning slot machine slinging out silver dollars.
Frodo was greatly relieved to see me again after two hours. I had made new friends. Thank you so much, Bikram and Manoj.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604620,"Tingling.  Twice a day like clockwork my fingers tingle. Is it when I am near Frodo and my heart is going pitter patter? It is at 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. Have you guessed the cause? It’s actually simple. Diamox. The high altitude climbers  friend. We started taking 125 mg twice a day three days ago. 
It took till day nine days of hiking before there was a breakout. It’s really too early for this. We hiked a full morning and had a civilized climb of just over 1,000 feet. Maybe it was the altitude. But when I walked out my lodge door it was going full swing. It was a full epidemic, or rather epic outbreak of food discussion. “A nice filet minion.” “I’d love a hot plate of fajitas. That sizzling sound is to die for.” And on and on for fifteen minutes. With nine of twenty-one days under our belts, it’s too early.
One side of the tea house common room had an steaming in the windows. When our talk has begun to wonder when we should drain the water out of our platypus bladder at night so it wont freeze, a warm corner of a room is a precious commodity. Frodo and I were like two cats curled in front of the fireplace while outside less than twenty feet away a yak grazed.
Frodo: Today was a pretty sane day. We hiked only about three hours this morning and gained about 1200 feet. We're now in the village of Dingboche at 14,200 feet. We can no longer see Everest, but we can still see Nuptse Ridge and Lhotse, as well as some new mountains that include Island Peak. We also have a totally different perspective on Ama Dablam, which continues to look very vertical.
So now we're sitting in the dining room after lunch. It's gotten a bit windy and cold outside, but the sun is coming through the window and we're pretty toasty. We'll be here for two nights. Tomorrow we have options for day hikes, to help with our acclimatization. Even I plan to climb 1000 feet to an overlook.","Pangboche

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604643,"Frodo: I am sick.  I have a bad head cold; you know, the kind where you feel like your face is melting. I have saturated three bandanas with snot in the past 24 hours.  My eyes are runny and my throat is raw.  Absolutely no fun.  Hard to sleep, partly because I keep waking up and having to snort down mucus from my sinuses, which leaves me gasping in the thin air (and THAT's TMI).  So tonight I'll take some NyQuil.  When the packing list that WT provided included all kinds of OTC medications, especially meds for colds, I earnestly hoped I wouldn't need any.  Alas...I did get to take a shower today, that was rather interesting.  It involved a small room with a cement floor and a drain, some nails to hang up clothes and my pack towel, and a bucket of nice warm water with a 2-cup scoop,   Luckily the small room had two opaque plastic Windows that let in some warmth from the sunshine.  I always find it a challenge to get dried and dressed in the same space I've showered in.  But it was especially nice getting my hair clean after three days.  We're told that the next couple lodges will have shared toilets and maybe no showers.And on a high note (pun intended), I was at just over 15,000 feet today, which is a record for me.  I should break that tomorrow!
Scout: There has to be a note. Frodo wouldn’t leave without a note, Frodo would not do that, would she? Mingma and I looked for her for five minutes. There was no obvious place for a note.  We were on a morning acclimatization hike. Are you tired yet of me saying This is the highest I’ve ever been? Frodo had climbed this steep hill behind Dingboche reaching over 15,000 feet, after a 1,000 foot gain, It was her highest ever. She was huffing and puffing, but we reached her goal, a tower of prayer flags and I said I wanted to climb on a ways further. Three hundred more foot gain. When Mingma and I get back a half hour later. No Frodo. Had she gone behind a bush. They were few and far between. Finally I spotted what looked like folded toiled paper under a rock. It was a crumpled tissue and said she’d grown too chilled and had headed down. We’d missed her by ten minutes. I was greatly relieved. A photo of the note is with the journal photos.
I guess that I finally must own up and tell you, and tell myself, that the Khumbu cough I’ve had for six days is really also a deep chest cold.The thick mucus plugs in my bandana multiple times a day can’t be denied.  It makes what is already dang hard, even harder. On some of these sustained stair-step steep uphills I have been using all my long-trail mental tricks. This morning I was running through as many of the songs from the musical the Music Man that I could remember.
The princesses have been heard from. Here’s he email from their dad:
Trail Journal Parenting Lesson #3: It is best not to let a 9 year old search on the internet for four syllable words for ""poop"".  Ah, the parenting lessons we have learned through trailjournals!  
On another note, you appear to have officially set the high altitude record for a rubber duck!  There are no internet references to any guiness world record or other record list for rubber ducks at altitude, or for rubber duckie first ascents!  (Scout: There is a world record for the largest rubber duckie. Get this, the largest is taller than a six-story building, 61 feet tall and 68 feet wide. The subject of nightmares.)
Jessica is still working on the sentence of all four syllable words (not an easy challenge!).  We may have to help her a bit with the poop challenge.  The best that father of the princesses could do is ""defecation"" which may or may not describe the actual product in question (is it the act or the product of said act?).  My wife exited the conversation when I asked her if it is a noun or a verb.  Perhaps your trial crew can make an official ruling? We will see if Princess Jessica comes up with something tomorrow!  She did get some good words for poop, but a few syllables short.  Not sure where they learn this stuff!!!
Thanks, DanScout: Our trail crew was ruthless. They will not allow “defecation.” But they did come up with another word that is four syllables that is for a subset of poop. Hint: It also begins with a “d.”","Dingboche

I am no wuss, But this would be hard at sensible elevations. Has a little whining crept in? If you could see the state of my bandana this morning, the dried hard plugs of mucus, you might say that I’m allowed 
The steepest part of the day was the 1,000 foot climb of the terminal moraine of Everest’s Khumbu glacier. Seeing the clumps of trekkers probably numbering in the hundreds make their way slowly up it reminded me of a scene from over a century ago. In the 1896 Alaska Klondike gold rush, the most feared segment of the route was Chilkoot Pass, another short steep, crowded climb. Take a look at the lead photo and google old photos of Chilkoot Pass and see if one doesn’t evoke the other. We were way grateful to reach the top.

The tea houses all have main rooms that are very similar. In the center there is a single dried yak dung stove. It’s not lit till four usually. They pour in a cup or two of kerosene and throw in a match. If we are lucky, it lights and draws well and yak dung smoke doesn’t fill up the room. Usually the room is ringed with tables with windows on three sides. Our Sherpa guide prearranged a table for us at each tea room For others it is catch as catch can and they order off the menu.
How cold was it last night? There was ice in my water bladder when we woke up—inside our room. Another trekker brought his frozen stiff socks to breakfast. The high was around 25 and the low was 9. 
My cold is worse. I now sound like a 40-year-long chain smoker. I need to lose altitude. Tomorrow night we will sleep 1200 feet lower.]

On our PCT hike a very strong couple quit in the middle of the Sierra Nevada. It really shook Frodo and I up.

By the way as we have gotten higher, the cost to recharge has gone up. Back in Namche Bazaar, where the air was positively thick at 11,000 feet, we actually had sockets in our room. But as we rose to 13,000 and 15,000 the room plugs disappeared and they were charging 200 rupees an hour for a place at the one power strip in the common room. At 17,000 feet, the charge went to 400 rupees an hour and the phones on the one power strip looked like piglets rooting to get access to a teat. I last recharged my two external battery packs four days ago and still have a few days left. 400 rupees is about four dollars.
Yesterday near Everest Base Camp there was a sign that informed us, “No Necked Photos at Base Camp.” Maybe the temperature was in the teens. “Necked” photos were my on my mind.
It was a hard hiking day but harder still was the decision Frodo and I made. My parents had written’ “Make wise decisions.” Tomorrow is Cho La pass which will culminate four hard days with likely the hardest of all, getting over the 1800-foot pass which will require our micr0 spikes and rock scrambling. It’s not avoidable, but the early morning, 6:00 am side trip to Kala Patthar is optional. I still felt bad making the decision, but if I had been home I would have already spent a couple of days in bed trying to knock out this cold. Even with the concession, it was a long day hiking, but blessedly we are sleeping back down at 15,300 feet.
Tomorrow is Cho La Pass. I think about it as much as my five-year-old self thought about waking up to my birthday. But one was wth excitement and joy, the other was with no small degree of fear.

The yaks, who can claw their way up anything, can’t make it up Cho La Pass. We won’t see most of our gear for two days. Our micro spikes are in our packs and we expect to use them. We leave with the temperature in the single digits and maybe it will be at the teens midday at the pass.
(Princess alert) We pack a little night kit like a boyfriend hoping he might get lucky. I’m surprised I wrote that. Using a population of one, I have proved that male libido falls exponentially with altitude. 
I guess I am trying to avoid writing about how hard it was. I walked behind Frodo and I would try holding off looking up until I knew I could see significant progress. Steep, rocky and at any time a rock you thought looked rigidly in place might rock or give way. I employed all my mental games, singing my way through a legion of songs in my head while my breath pumped like a highballing freight train. It was a relief to finally have to put on the micro spikes because we could see that we only needed to climb through a few football field lengths of ice and we would be nearly at the top.
I was Traction Man. At the top I leaned into Frodo’s shoulder and sobbed. We’d made it.
Frodo said it was the most difficult thing she’d done in her life. Henceforth, anytime one of us says something is difficult, the other is just going to say, “But it’s not Cho La Pass.

Do you know what event nearly overshadowed Queen Elizabth’s coronation in 1952? The princesses should know this. It was Hillary and Tenzing’s first ascent of Everest.
It was billed as an easy day. Anything could be billed that after Cho La Pass. We crossed the miles-wide Nogumba Glacier. Wipe from your mind those classic sweeping white, Mississippi river of compressed snow views you’ve seen of Alaska’s or Antarctica’s rivers of ice. The surface of the Nogumba was covered by rocks and gavel with a series of random hills. There were frozen lakes we threw rocks upon only to hear the sound of a deep kettle drum. We wound our way over the living glacier with more twists than a writhing snake.
We did reach Goyko not long past noon. We were reunited with our team of four yaks which meant we we were reunited with out great, too. Hopes of my first shower in five days faded as it turned to late afternoon and the prospect of a weak, barely warm stream in a sub-thirty-degree room was too daunting even to a person who has climbed Cho La Pass.

I’ve seen many of our national parks, I’ve walked from Mexico to Canada twice and once from Maine to Georgia, but seldom have I had the pleasure of walking a more gorgeous river valley. The Dudkhosi River Valley has no car overlooks, no tour buses. To get here you are probably six days from the nearest roadhead and most accessed the valley by hiking three or four days after landing at the most dangerous airport in the world. In other words, Yosemite it ain’t.
 For twelve miles we hike clinging to a path high along its side.  They aren’t the sheer sides like the Grand Canyon, but when we drop 1,000 feet to cross the river, that’s a just a little fraction of the height of 5-,6-, 7,000-foot mountains that define its sides. The river flows strong like the upper Colorado in the northern half of the eponymous state. It’s so cold that center-river boulders the size of a garage are covered with ice despite the rushing water. Streams that feed it are marked by their white frozen paths that sluice down two, three or more thousand feet on its sides. And the valley is crowned by snow-covered mountains, the biggest is the world.   
It’s enough to make you gasp, except the sneaky, 1,000 climb that breaks up the general descent, does it’s own good job of that.  
We end 8 hours of hiking at Pemba’s house. We are sleeping there. After the big 2015 earthqake, Pemba rebuilt his house and added an upper floor that could be used as a guest house. Tonight, we are guests in our lead guide’s home. Tonight, we are down at 12,800 feet. For the last time, yesterday, we took the high-altitude diamox, No more tingling fingers. No more getting up four or more times a night. And even though the high today did not reach 32 degrees, it feels warmer. 
Frodo:  My entry below was actually written several days ago, just before my iPad died and wouldn’t revive until it got to a lower elevation., So bear that in mind.  At this point it doesn’t really make sense to put it in where it belongs.  On a side note, we’re still petty sick, spend a lot of our time feeling exhausted, ad are enjoying the thicker air.
Frodo’s old post: 
My husband is a saint.  He's on this trip at my behest, it's been tougher than either of us expected, he has a cold, and yet I haven't heard him complain at all, except for the tiny bit that crept into his journal entry yesterday. I'm the one who chose this trip, saw the ""very strenuous"" designation, and didn't bat an eye.  He's the one who has been cheerful and helpful and with a very positive attitude.  I'm pretty darn lucky.
By the way, in my defense regarding Scout's difficulty finding my note two days ago:  it was REALLY cold and I did wait a half hour for them to go 'a little further'.  I also left the note right next to the rock where I told them, 'This is where I will wait.'
 
Okay, I'm going to go back to the metaphor of the weak link.  Pemba in his wisdom came to me yesterday morning and told me that, because I am so sick, Jomba would carry my daypack for me.  Ouch!  I've always been a very competent hiker and have definitely carried my weight, but I had to admit he was right.  I did do okay today and was not the last hiker for the second half of the day's hike, but I probably would have struggled more if I had had to carry my pack.  Same drill for today.  This is not easy to admit for me.  I guess age and Parkinson's have taken more of a toll than I like to admit.  And I am still quite sick, blowing my nose frequently as well as sneezing and now coughing.  That seems to sap some of my energy.
Today, while the rest of the group trekked off to see Everest Base Camp, I stayed here at Snowland Lodge, where we will all sleep tonight.  I am trying to conserve my energy for a big day tomorrow.  We will leave Gorak Shep early to climb Kala Patar (a dark peak rising 1300' above town) for our best view of Everest.  I have assured Pemba that I'm okay with getting halfway up Kala Patar, since I don't want to slow down the group. Because then we will pass back through Gorak Shep, back through Lobuche, and on to Dzonglha for the night.  It will be a long day for all of us.  But we'll be sleeping almost a thousand feet lower, and I think my body will appreciate access to a bit more oxygen.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604938,"Scout: Early in the morning Pemba makes a point of showing us the prayer room in his home. This cosmopolitan man who leads this crew of more than a dozen staff as well as the seven of us with gentle nudges on the tiller, who spends most summers in Bend, Oregon, is also deeply religious. The room is easily the size of two of the “guest” bedrooms, its appointments could pass for a mini version of the Buddhist monasteries we have seen. 
The first thing we do after breakfast is visit the 12-monk monastery this tiny, mountain-clinging village manages to support. It has been entirely rebuilt since the 2015 earthquake—a near-Herculean effort.
Once hiking, we quickly drop down to the river, all the while staring us in face on the other side is the last big climb we will have on this trip. I am going to treat myself. For the first time this trek I am going to pop in the earbuds in my postage-stamp-size iPod shuffle and listen to that 70-song power mix that so often sustained me on the Appalachian Trail. And with my chest cold waning like the moon in the last quarter of the month, I am going to go uphill with the lead-dog group. My late sixties hits, songs from Les Miserables, and all the rest lift my feet up the big irregular steps. We go into a higher gear to pass a string of four yaks. That tested each of the five of us. It felt like an all-out sprint that was yards too long. But let me tell you, the euphoria of reaching the top—and the view—and especially seeing we were so close to where we had been just over two weeks before. It was a reward better than a full page of gold stars or a room full of trophies. 
The final two hours to Namche Bazaar was almost entirely downhill and there we were in the same room we’d been in just over two weeks ago. Deja Vu. We were so innocent back then. Our lungs were clear. We have two more hiking days left.  
Frodo:  Sorry I haven’t written more in the past week or so.  My energy level has been really low.  Of the seven in our group, six of us have had colds, but mine and Scout’s has been the worst by far.  (The only one of us not to get sick is Lisa the anesthesiologist.  She uses hand sanitizer religiously and it has wooed.). At home, a cold like this would have had me napping and taking it very easy.  At the elevations we’ve been at, it’s really knocked me for a loop.  All the places I had looked forward to being - Everest Base Camp, the top of Kala Patar, and the top of Gokyo Ri - I have not been to.  I had to rest each of those days, for fear I wouldn’t be able to do the non-optional hiking from village to village.  But what I really came here for was to see huge, gorgeous mountains, and that I have most certainly done.
We are not alone in thinking the trails and routes here are tough.  Two young German couples - probably mid 20’s and athletic looking - told us in Gokyo that they had planed to hike the thee Passes route.  They had gone over Renjo Pass - reputed to be the easiest of the three - and felt they shouldn’t attempt Cho-La Pass, as they barely got over Renjo.  Granted, they were humping their own gear, and that makes a big difference.  Our Sherpas and porters were invaluable when we did Cho-La.
Jomba has been varying my daypack for me since he started doing so over a week ago, at Pemba’s request.  My cold is a bit better now and I could certainly carry my own light pack, but Pemba prefers this arrangement and I’m not going to second-guess him.  I feel Ike I have my own personal Sherpa watching out for me.  We do intend to give Jomba a nice tip at the end.
We have been blessed with really good weather.  Typically, the morning is clear and crisp with stunning views of the mountains.  In the afternoon some clouds start to play peek-a-boo with the peaks and it often becomes quite cloudy.  We’re told this is the normal pattern for late October, and we’re grateful we haven’t had to deal with any rain.  It’s nice now to be in Namche where the high temperature should be above freezing, for the first time in a while.","Pemba’s House

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604963,"Scout: I woke up thinking of a Japanese fad. I’d had the best night’s sleep in two weeks. It’s amazing what more oxygen and humidity will do. What I woke up thinking about was “oxygen bars.” In Japan, establishments sprang up like so many Starbucks, dispensing concentrated, scented oxygen to patrons. If I opened an oxygen and humidity bar up here, it would be just Iike printing money.We are unwinding our path. These last two days we retrace the steps of our younger, more innocent selves. If we’d had any idea what it would be like to have a severe cold at 17,000 feet, how Cho La Pass would test us, would we have had the same cheery smiles?I remember that waterfall, that grossly mis-spelled sign in English. It is a relatively easy four-hour hike. When we get to our lodge a series of luxuries unfolds. Electric outlets are in our rooms, not 500 rupees an hour for one plug. But the best was the shower. Showers for nearly three weeks have been ordeals holding out the promise of being clean at the end, but meanwhile the hot water is just a bit more than a trifle, the ambient air temperature is lower than the refrigerator in your home kitchen, 38 degrees. You shiver, shaking and then don your semi-clean long underwear, down puffy jacket and finally you are clean and warm-ish. One shower consisted of a three-gallon bucket of warm water sold to you for 500 rupees. Today the shower was in our own room bathroom, the flow was fine and it was hot. Aaaaahhhhh.Quacky, the rubber ducky, is ready to be home with the princesses again.    
Frodo:  I think both Scout and I are ready to be home as well.  A few more days...
Yesterday as we hit the outskirts of Namche, hiking into it from up above, there was a rock wall outside a small eating establishment with some loaded carrying baskets on it.  Jomba slowed and looked quizzically at the baskets, when two of our kitchen boys ran out of the eating establishment, slipped the carrying baskets on their backs and the broad strap over their foreheads and took off running and giggling as Pemba and Jomba hollered after them and Lisa East and I called out, “busted!”  It was good to see the shy kitchen boys (who are about 16 and very cute) having a bit of fun.  Most of the time they work very hard.  They are not Sherpas; they are from the Rai (sp?) people below Lukla.  They work up here for the trekking season and will go back to school once our trip is over.For this section between Namche and Lukla we will use porters to carry all our gear, rather than yaks.  There are hybrids between cows and yaks that are used for transport at these lower elevations and that have a really unusual name, that I can’t remember and I can’t look up right now because the internet is not working here at the lodge.  It’s a bit hard to see the porters carrying such heavy loads.  Most of them are not Sherpas, according to Pemba.  They come from the foothills area up here to work.  The people who live and work up here have a tough life.  They have no roads nor vehicles; they often have to walk long distances to purchase goods and then carry them home those long distances.  They have to wash, rinse, and wring all their laundry by hand, which takes a lot of time. They deal with extreme weather on a regular basis.  They can't just turn up the thermostat in their home, they have to spend time in the summer and fall collecting yak dung, patting it flat to dry, and then storing it to burn during the cold months.  So much of their time is spent working.  I really admire them, but I’m glad my life is so much easier.So I still have a bad cold and some bangs and scrapes from falling (mostly back onto my tush as I head downhill and little stones underfoot act like ball bearings).  But what I haven’t had cause to complain about are MY FEET.  Ever since hiking the PCT 11 years ago, I have had issues with my feet.  Last spring I learned that one of the pains in my left foot is due to a partially torn ligament that has never healed properly and never will.  The pain could get pretty awful and I worried that it would be trek-threatening.  I saw a chiropractor who specializes in feet, outside Denver, and she gave me exercises that helped but, more importantly, she recommended Altra superior shoes.  They’ve helped a lot.  I can’t walk around barefoot or in my down booties, but as long as my feet are in those shoes, I’m fine.  Yay!  Except that just today I developed blisters under two of the toenails on my left foot; you know, the kind where the blister lifts up the toenail and it turns black.  (Or maybe you don't know?)","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605027,"Scout: We can’t help but be a little nostalgic about today’s hike. It’s about four hours and it covers the same ground as our first day’s hike. “This is where we stopped for lunch.” “This was our first break spot, remember?” We can’t help but commune with our first-day trekking selves and marvel at the distance we’ve come.
We see faces obviously right off the morning planes into Lukla and wonder what they are thinking? The last steps into the town of Lukla I slow down, wait for Frodo to catch up. We will walk these last steps together.

We walk past stalls filled with Everest and Himalayan souvenirs—pullover caps, yak wool shawls, t-shirts, yak bells and rows of curved daggers in scabbards. These curved short swords look like they could be made of damascene steel, straight out of Ali Baba and the 40 thieves.

Do you know of Damascus steel? In the middle ages, the finest blades ever produced were forged of Damascus steel. Even today we can’t produce steel that will hold an edge any better. The exact formula has been lost. What is known is that the steel in these blades was subject to repeated cycles of heating, hammering and then cooling. 
How have Frodo and I fared on this trip? Did it stress, did it test our relationship? What this trek did was thrust us into the forge once again—the rigors of altitude, sickness and covering some of the hardest ground we’ve ever hiked. We were hammered and through it all there was never a harsh word, just empathy for what the other was going through. And humor, lots of humor, even at times if it was closer to gallows humor than anything else. Once again our marriage was thrust into a forge, heated, hammered and allowed to cool. One more wavy layer of steel was laid down over our forty-one year marriage, our blade made of Damascus steel.

That night at Lukla, we partied, dancing to Krishna’s flute and to Nepali bubble-gum pop rock. Most nights after our 6:30 dinner, we started heading off to our rooms by 7:30 or eight at the latest. Tonight we stayed up till 10:00.

Tomorrow we fly back to Kathmandu. It is time.  

Frodo:  We’re back in Lukla!  No more hiking!  No more scary suspension bridges! It’s very nice to feel a sense of accomplishment but now be able to rest these weary bones and muscles.

 The trail was pretty crowded this morning – lots of folks heading in-country as they start their treks.  We kept thinking how innocent and naïve they look and thought, “If only you knew…”

 It’s been interesting, noticing who all comes out here.  The largest number of trekkers come from Germany.  The second largest group seems to be from Australia.  There are folks from the UK and France and Spain.  Americans are definitely in the minority here.

 We spent the afternoon here at the lodge napping and reading and letting ourselves start recuperating.

 Look in the photos to see a typical set of tall steps.  That’s Lisa West, and she’s several inches taller than I am.  No wonder my quads and glutes are so pooped!","
",Lukla,"Oct 30, Tue",6
Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605228,"Scout: Rolling Thunder made me cry. He knew he would.
We roll out of our sleeping bags well before dawn. It’s 4:30 am. We pack our duffels for Pemba and his crew. For the last time. At 5:15 we have “porridge.” For the last time. We are set to fly out on one of the first flights from Lukla to Kathmandu. We need to be at the airport before 6:00 am. We are so ready to be down at 4,000 feet. Ready to relax in a hotel room where the temperature isn’t below freezing. Ready to have a shower that’s more than a trickle. I promise myself—I am going to stand in the shower for at least twenty minutes. 
In the middle of the night I woke and realized I’d forgotten something important. You remember that I‘d climbed up to Ama Dablam base camp two weeks ago and left a surprise packet there for our good friend Rolling Thunder. He’d written back to say that he’d left a package for me here in Lukla at our Villa Sherpani Lodge. With the intensity of finishing our hike yesterday and then dancing away the evening, I’d completely forgotten about it. This morning, I tell Pemba first thing. Starting at 5:00 am Pemba starts calling the lodge manager. No answer. Fifteen minutes later, no answer. Same at 5:30. We make contingency plans. Pemba will pick the package up after our plane takes off, email me a photo and try to get it out on a plane tomorrow. At 5:45 the manager picks up the phone. I get Rolling Thunder’s package. I open it. It is a custom T-shirt he had made. Above a line of Nepali prayer flags it says, “The Triple Crown” and below the flags he had embroidered, “And Everest Base Camp Too.”

And that’s me, a Triple Crowner who has now set foot in Everest Base Camp. I felt very loved and cared for. Rolling Thunder you did well.

The Lukla airport scene is everything you might imagine about a crowded third world airport. Chaotic, planes landing and an airport attendant sticks her head in the waiting room door and over the roar of the prop wash tries to holler out the plane number over the din. In groups of fourteen, trekkers duck their heads and hurriedly scramble up the ramps into the tiny planes. They land and take off again fully loaded in under fifteen minutes. That puts even Southwest airlines to shame. We are the sixth group. And from the moment we take off, we are descending. Down, down, down. We see the first roads we’ve seen in three weeks.

At the hotel I fulfill all the promises I made to myself. I make the only phone call my parents will ever receive from Kathmandu.

I have seen the big mountains. We have persevered. Life is good.","

Scout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605286,"Final Entry.

 Scout: Tomorrow we fly out to go home. Twenty hours flying. Today is our last day for the seven us to see each other. We make plans for dinner at Rum Doodle, a famed haunt of Everest climbers and trekkers. Hundreds of expeditions have signed nearly yard-long cardboard yeti feet and then hang their names and group’s exploits from the ceiling.
Rum Doodle is a 40,000 and a half foot peak. Yes, I typed that right. “The Ascent of Rum Doodle” is a famed 1956 spoof of big expedition mountain climbing. A recent re-print sported a foreword by Bill Bryson.
I indulge in eating most the day. I still fill handkerchiefs with an amazing volume of the most god-awful colored stuff to ever come out of my nose. 
I don’t think I’ve told you my final thoughts about being an expedition-led sheep. I’ll be honest. Many aspects were really quite nice. Having a rolled steamed towelette given each of us right before dinner. Our sleeping bags laid out on our beds with our bags in our rooms by the time we arrived at that night’s tea lodge. Feeling mutual respect between the seven of us and Pemba, our guides and the rest of our staff. What was hardest on me was being on someone else’s schedule for 21 days, having next to no control over what’s for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On a long trail, I am so used to making those small and large decisions and that sense of being able to control those things is so important to me—that’s what sheared this sheep, what ended up being the hardest.
The lead photo is of us at Rum Doodle’s with our Yeti foot ready to hang with the rest. Thanks to Don and Kim, Lisa east and Lisa West and to Ted—we could not have asked for better companions.
Finally, let me tell you where I am right now--Nov. 14th. I am finishing up a book tour in Colorado for my new book about the Continental Divide Trail.
