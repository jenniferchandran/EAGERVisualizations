Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455408,"It's strange how life works. I've finally reached a point in my life where I can afford to take time off work and have the financial means to thru hike. Yet, I find myself not wanting to be away from my family for five or six months. The idea of being away from my family and friends, my pets, my garden, my job...wait no not my job, my life in general, makes me sad. So, for now, it is the life of a section hiker for me. I earned my trailname by falling while crossing a stream in Otter Creek Wilderness Area in West Virginia. In 2013 I sectioned hiked the entire Georgia section of the A.T. I started at Springer and stopped at Deep Gap in NC. I proved to myself that, physically I can do the trail. 
I've wanted to hike the AT since I saw the ""Trailside: Make Your Own Adventure "" episodes on the A.T., while I was in high school. Surprisingly the first book I read on the A.T was ""Murder On The Appalachian Trail"". It was given to me by an aunt ( who I think was trying to discourage me from wanting to hike the trail) No, I didn't want to hike the A.T. because of the crime (the story of the murder of two A.T. hikers In the early 1980's). I was fascinated by the description of the trail and its trekkers. (I only say this because another person on this site took issue with the content of the book.) I've beeen on numerous weeklong or shorter trips since I started backpacking in the early nineties, finally stepping foot on Springer in 2013.(For me, the A.T. experience begins at Amicalola and includes the approach trail.)I think that covers the basics. Looking forward to meeting many of you on the trail.             Happy Trails,                Rockhead",,First Entry,"May 12, Mon",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456500,"   Spent a few hours at the local state park, hiking around the lake with a 43lbs pack (all my winter gear and six days of food). I'm very comfortable with my pack weight, I use everything in my pack and would not feel comfortable leaving anything behind. I do intend to replace my air mattress and tent with lighter models, which will save me nearly three more pounds. The only luxury item I am thinking of carrying is a bear canister. This would be so I could camp on top of Blood Mountain. Last year I got to camp with some thru-hikers on top of Blood, some of the best friends I've ever made hiking. If anyone met the Barking Spiders last year, I'm the one who came up with the name. However, Barter, G-Baby, Patches, Fresh Prince, Grilled Cheese, TJ, and Hitch are the ones who became the legends. I find myself thinking about that hike at the most unexpected moments, and the memories never fail to bring a smile to my face. Happy Trails.",,Practice Day!,"May 18, Sun",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461533,"Just returned from a family vacation in the Great Smoky Mts. We rented a cabin outside Gatlinburg and managed to avoid thre rain for 5 of the 7 days we were there. We saw 3 bears, did Clingman's Dome (my stepson and I took the side trail to the A.T., he wants to do a thru hike when he graduates high school and I can even go with him if I want to. Class of 2020) The highlight of the trip was seeing the Elkmont fireflies, if you are unfamiliar with them, the Elkmont fireflies flash synchronously but only for one week out of the entire year. I did manage to get in a couple of day hikes, but no overnights in the backcountry this time. However, the hot tub at the cabin after day hiking was a nice consolation prize.

Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462661,"Just wondering if I'm the only one who is doing a ""simulated hike"". I have my thru-hikers companion, maps, and a chart from the thru hikers handbook. Everyday I check the weather in the area I'm ""hiking"" at and use the maps to try and estimate how far I would cover if I were on the trail. If I were on the trail I would be leaving Shenandoah Nat Park today. Before anyone gets their convertible pants in a bunch, yes I know a map only gives you an idea of what to expect, and I know, from firsthand experience, that all planning goes out the window as soon as you actually step on the trail (like last year when I budgeted 4 days to Neels Gap but got there in 6). I'm doing this for mainly entertainment purposes. However, although the hiking part is not going to go according to this ""simulation"", doing this has giving me a better understanding of how costs can inflate beyond what was planned. An example of this would be N.O.C. I had planned on staying there for the night, however the next day had a forecast of snowstorms and a low of 15, I know myself and if I was actually on the trail I would take a zero and avoid the storm, so this is what I did on my ""simulated hike"", extra money spent and a lost day. Will this actually happen next year? Maybe. Will I set aside more money than I need? Hopefully. But as the old saying goes, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Another plus has been determining places to use maildrops rather than shop for resupply. Postage is a killer but so is wasting your ""off"" day running all over town trying to resupply. Besides I'm a picky eater and I would rather pay extra for what I want instead of settling for what's available. Also, for your consideration, when I was in Hiawassee last year, every store in town was sold out of blister kits (I checked both grocery stores and the drug store next to Budget Inn, all sold out). In short, I know that nothing beats actual hiking for being prepared but this helps pass the time until I put foot to trail. So, do you do this and if so where are you on your hike?   ",,Are you doing this too?,"Jun 22, Sun",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464273,"Sitting in the lounge at work playing with my maps and trail itinerary and one of the administraters comes in and asks me what I'm planning for. I tell him I'm planning on doing a thru hike. He gets a faraway look in his eyes and says ""I always wanted to hike the trail when I was younger."" I've had many people express interest in my hike but this is the third person I've met in the last year who has told me they always wanted to hike the trail but that life got in the way. This makes me realize how lucky I am that I have a girlfriend, family, and friends who all want to be a part of the experience and will give me all the emotional support I need. And that I've reached a point in my life where I'm able to have the opportunity to fulfill one of the biggest dreams of my life. By the way, one of the three is a teacher who is retiring in June of 2016. He says he may actually try to do the trail in 2017. Happy Trails.",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Wed",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466674,"Got back a couple of days ago from a family camping trip in the Hocking Hills. I was able to hike the Gramma Gatewood section of the Buckeye Trail. This trail runs from Old Man's Cave to Ash Cave and is about 5 miles long. For those of you unfamiliar with the area, Old Man's Cave, a sandstone gorge, and Ash Cave, a 90-foot high recess cave, are in Ohio's Hocking Hills State Park and are considered two of the major natural attractions in Ohio. Anyways, I was able to do the entire hike, plus another 2.6 miles on other trails for a daily total of 7.6 miles. I would describe the terrain as moderate.
    One of the sidetrails was the trail to Moonville Tunnel in Zaleski State Forest. This is a supposedly haunted train tunnel where a brakeman/signalman (accounts vary) was killed by a train sometime in the 1800's. Although we did not see anything nor did anything mysterious show up in any of the photos, a widowmaker did fall out of a tree and landed about 10 feet from us(My fiancee and stepson were hiking with me) definitely a warning from the spirits to leave the area and go lounge in the swimming pool at the campground, so we heeded this other worldly advise. I think I heard the voices speaking to me from beyond the grave telling me to drink some adult beverages, so not wanting to offend the spirits I did this too.

Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/467611,"For those living close to Cleveland and those living in the Columbus area, two good prep hikes are the sections of the Buckeye Trail in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park (Cleveland) and the B.T. in Hocking Hills State Park otherwise known as the Gramma Gatewood Trail. Both hikes are described in detail in Ralph Ramey's 50 Hikes In Ohio, an excellent hiking guide. The B.T. in CVNP is combined with the Towpath Trail for a total of 9.5 miles, in my opinion, this is the best trail in the Cleveland area for scenery and elevation change. This trail can be completed in 3-4 hours. The Gramma Gatewood trail is only 5 miles long, but you can do it as an out and back for a total of 10 miles. This is the best trail, in Ohio, for preparing for the A.T. that I have hiked. This trail can usually be completed in 4-5 hours. Hope you enjoy them. Happy Trails.",,Prep Hikes,"Jul 25, Fri",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469020,"Just returned from chaperoning my stepson's Boy Scout Troop's trip to Philadelphia. The boys are working on their citizenship in the nation merit badge. We visited The Liberty Bell, Constitution Center, Independence Hall, The Franklin Institute, the USS New Jersey, The Seaport Museum (a very cool tour of the USS Olympia, google it.) The Fireman's Museum, and various monuments and statues. Everyone had a great time. I got the thrill of crossing the A.T. on Route 30 in PA as we passed by Calendonia State Park, no one else wanted to stop as we were on our way to Gettysburg, where we took a break before driving to Philly. I totaled 17 miles of walking on my pedometer but all were city miles. The biggest thrill for the troop was riding the train into Philly, especially as it passed over the Delaware River on the Ben Franklin Bridge. We live in a rural county in Ohio, with a very large Amish population. To say the least, it was a cultural experience the boys will never forget. Happy Trails.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Mon",0
Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471585,"Just finished rereading my journal from my hike on the A.T. from April 2013. I had forgotten how surprised I was by the number of people who were attempting a thru hike and it was the first time they had ever been backpacking. I think it would be an interesting study to find out how many first timers actually hike the whole trail. My hiker-ego tells me this must be the largest group of people who don't finish, but I could be wrong. For those of you who have never backpacked before, DO NOT underestimate the value of spending a night out in the woods when it's windy and raining, and you are soaked with sweat and you find everything in your pack soaked, especially your sleeping bag. Nothing will let you know quicker if backpacking is for you than a night spent shivering in your tent and getting a couple of hours of sleep (if you're lucky). I don't want to discourage anybody but I have had this experience more than once, you learn alot when things go wrong.    The other thing I noticed in my journal (I haven't read it since last summer) was the number of entries where I noted that I was carrying too much food, especially in the first few days when I actually had a hard time eating(Skipped dinner twice). This lasted until Neel Gap, when my appetite returned. So lessons learned: 1) invest in good dry sacks 2) don't try to eat 4,000 calories a day in Georgia. Happy Trails.",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Sun",0

So, this Christmas I got alot of hiking gear and an opportunity to check off a bucket list vacation, however it would mean postponing my thru-hike until 2017. My fiancee and I have decided to take a family road trip in 2016 to see several of the western National Parks. It was a trip she took with her family when she was a child, and has always dreamed of taking her children on the same trip. We are going to rent an RV and spend several weeks seeing Yellowstone, Mt Rushmore, and several other places. Since I had already postponed my thru-hike until 2016, and factoring in that her children are getting older (her youngest is in junior high), my fiancee wanted to go in 2016, while the kids are still enthusiastic about the trip (disgruntled, bored teenagers can be so pleasant on road trips). I agreed to do the trip next year mainly, because of my feelings that, for people in a relationship, a thru-hike is a very selfish desire. My fiancee can not go with me even if she wanted to(she does not)for reasons of work, family, etc. Yet she is supporting my dream of hiking the A.T., (she tells me she doesn't want for me to wait until I retire to do it, that I should go soon, then I'll have the memories and the experience to enjoy for the rest of my life.) She will be managing the household and handling the problems while I'm off in the woods having an adventure. So, my decision was easy. Happy Trails.    ",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Thu",0

Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480909,"   With the new gear I've bought and received as gifts, I've been able to lower my backpack weight from the 46 lbs it was in 2013 (winter gear and 6 days of food) when I hiked the A.T., down to 39 lbs. I took my pack on a 4 mile hike at the local state park and the difference in weight is amazing. I know there are alot of ""ultralighters"" who would scoff at my celebrating a 39 lbs pack. I've never been one to advocate the ""ultra light"" movement. In fact my experience with ultra light hikers on the A.T., especially the inexperienced ones who had obsessed about packweight but had actually done very little if any hiking with their new gear, is that they tend to want to ""borrow"" gear like waterpumps and stoves, and are surprised to find they are not going to get a spot in the shelter most nights. Don't get me wrong. when I hear someone say they never carry more than 25 lbs or whatever, I'm envious. But, I feel that a hiker should be able to rely on his or her own gear to see them through the entire hike, without expecting others to constantly make up for their lack of preparation. In 2013, there was a hiker, we'll call him Feather (not his real name) who constantly bragged about his 20 lbs pack but every night at the shelters he wanted to borrow someone's stove or water purifier, or whatever. In one case he wanted to borrow anybody's tent or hammock because the shelter was full and he only had a tarp to weather a 15 degree snowstorm. One hiker relented and agreed to let Feather use a bivy shelter that the hiker then had to go and set up for Feather because Feather was ignorant of such things. (In Feather's defense he did take the Bivy shelter down the next day before the other hiker was even up, beforing leaving before most people were up.) But when our little bubble reached Mt. Crossings, I suggested to Feather that maybe he should buy a stove and shelter, he whined that his pack would be heavier than 20 lbs if he did. Feather wasn't a bad guy, thats probably why most hikers tolerated him as long as they did, but by Hiawassee people were avoiding Feather and he had gained a negative reputation after breaking one hiker's water pump handle and saying that he didn't have the money to repair it. I know that this is probably an extreme case but Feather's lack of preparation and refusal to adapt, brought a little negativity into several peoples hikes and he wasn't the only hiker who was asking to ""borrow"" gear, especially water purifiers. (I've often wondered how much loaning gear contributes to the norovirus outbreaks) That's why I feel, that after assembling your gear, it is essential to take it on a shake down hike, in bad weather if available. I'll stop preaching now, and if you are a self reliant ultra lighter feel free to condemn me in my guestbook, just don't expect me to loan you my laptop to do it.

Rockhead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492863,"Years ago, I read or heard somewhere that the best way to get your feet ready for a thru hike was to walk barefoot, on gravel. This statement re-occurred to me as I watched a fellow scout- parents' two preschoolers run around barefoot, on gravel, at the troops' weekly meeting. I realized I have a gravel driveway and I too could walk around barefoot, on gravel. So, for the last week, I have come home from work, and walked around barefoot, on gravel. Initially, I was disappointed in my gravel walking abilities, being able to walk only a few feet. This was particularly disheartening as preschoolers seem to be able to do it with ease. However as my distances increased, I realized that someday, with perseverance, I too would be able to run barefoot, on gravel. (In case I should ever be chased by a bear, while barefoot, on gravel.) Tonight, I was able to walk to the end of my 200 ft. driveway. I was happy with my success until I realized that I was barefoot, on gravel, and my house was 200 ft. away.

The difficulty of the never gets above moderate. The trail was described as popular, but I did not see another hiker until I got to Deep Gap.
