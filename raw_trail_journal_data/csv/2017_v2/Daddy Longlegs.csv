Are you awed by the walk you are on?My journey through life has taken me to extraordinary places and introduced fantastic people. Hope that you feel the same way! Our walk through life presents us with constant choices and I now stand on the verge of a significant turning point in my walk. Anticipating what the journey may hold, desiring to keep record of those wanderings, and providing a check in for family & friends has compelled the start of this trail journal.While likely stumbling from the gate a bit, hopefully this journal will climb mountains just as I will with my feet.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550712,"Like many a child of the 1970’s, the world was my playground. Roaming miles from home was normal for kids back then. Walking through the woods and/or getting muddy in the creek was simply what we did. Some days I was an explorer. Others a pirate. Or maybe a space man. What wonderful walks these journeys were…I feel blessed to have walked the path of my childhood.What do you see that enthralls you, fires your imagination, and gives you a hunger to experience life? My family does. My friends do. But my career choice is taxing me & regrets of the past are haunting me and so it is time for a change. It is time to roam again! With the blessing of my family I will be roaming 2,190+ miles from GA > ME in 2017.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550862,"My calf muscles hurt. Actually it felt as though they’d been replaced by hard rock-like knots. Oh foolish walker!Departing from Upper Whitewater Falls, NC overlook (the highest falls east of the Rockies) early on a Sunday morning and proceeding over hill-n-dale, camping overnight in the wild & scenic designated river section of the Chattooga [campsite pictured], negotiating the SC/GA border and eventually hiking along the blue ridge escarpment to Oconee State Park officially demolished my calf muscles. 30 miles in 28 hours is more than this unseasoned body could handle in stride.BUT I MADE IT.And I learned that I CAN make it. Also learned that I must listen to my body. I learned that chaffing is not only a real thing but very unpleasant. I learned I need a lighter pack for my next big walk. I learned my sleep system rocks, my cook system rocks, and my Altra trail runners rock. And nature rocks. I found myself reveling in her glory on numerous occasions. My church is the woods.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551171,"The times they are a changin'…In 1993, I spent a lot of time in preparation for an AT thru-hike: pulling together gear, weighing items, researching mail drops, etc. It seemed even harder then. There was no internet or smart phones. Books and Maps were the order of the day. Everything needed to be pre-planned to the calorie, packed, and mailed. Film (for you youngsters, this was the light sensitive substance we used to capture images) would have to be shipped to & fro. Egads.Ultimately, my attempt at an AT thru-hike failed in April of 1994… and thank goodness for that! In May of 1994 I met the woman of my dreams; we later married, and have been together ever since raising a family. Seems the universe had a plan after all. Now, decades later, I prepare to achieve the dream of a 'thru' once again. The preparation and logistics are still extraordinary and seem overwhelming. But for all my worries about boots, ounces, calories, finances and the like, the hardest things to contemplate about this journey are the changes it will bring and the time away from my wife and children. We have never spent this much time apart… and six months is a long time!And the changes…Children grow up so fast. Everyone has heard it said and/or said it. Being gone for six months… Will I recognize them? Shoot, will I recognize myself??I would venture that everyone who has ever completed an AT thru-hike comes back changed. And so I know everything will change. That isn't necessarily a bad thing but it does give me pause. I both seek and fear the change. My wife is supporting me but she too fears 'the change'. (On a positive note, I would also venture that no one who has ever completed an AT thru-hike has come back saying it ruined their life.) But change is inevitable in life, so I am going to try and embrace it. Let's see what the universe has in store this time.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551365,"In 1987 I finally replaced my first/awesome/old Kelty external frame pack and upgraded to a 'fancy' internal frame pack: the North Face Chameleon. It has been my go-to travel pack ever since. The pack has been hauled through the Southwestern desert, the Canadian Rockies, Bahamian waters, Irish countryside and many points between. I love the pack but, at roughly 5lbs, it has been one area that i have felt an upgrade was in order. Modern lightweight haulers are amazing gear and I have been holding out to make the pack acquisition one of my final steps.Everyone I have talked to has a different opinion on the right pack for a Thru-hike. Obviously there is no 'right answer' for everyone. Having whittled my options down to ULA, GossamerGear and Osprey products; I finally pulled the trigger [with the help of a great coupon] and acquired the Exos 58 last night.Yeah, yeah... it is a popular, big-box retailer offering but i think it is going to be great. Shoot, I just shaved 49ozs off my base weight too! Today I decided to use it on the morning walk [4 miles] carrying it with a small load of gear. Popped on my headphones, hit shuffle on the iPod and headed out. The universe chose Morning Dew from Pembroke Pines '77 to get us acquainted. ""Walk me out"" indeed... The pack felt so good...vindication for months of decision anxiety. And it wasn't just the weight/fit of the pack but the realization that the tumblers are falling in to place and I am ready for the adventure.Life is amazing...keep walking!",,New Pack,"Nov 10, Thu",0

I am so nervous-excited-anxious...shoot, just enter an emotion here and i have felt it these last few days.I stopped this journal at the end of 2016 as I needed to focus on moving on from my career. Not easy to leave a job after a few decades; Lots of great client relationships to transition, terrific co-workers to bid farewell, family responsibilities to take care of, etc. Having stepped away last week I am now ready to take a very long walk.I plan to leave Amicalola Falls and take the approach trail to Springer Mtn. This puts my official journey at 2,199.1 miles to the top of Mt Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Maine. I hope to arrive there in September.My pack is ready to go. Certainly there will be changes as the walk unfolds... what to ship home and what to have my support team send me. The kids know how to pack my re-supply boxes and the gear table is full of items that might need to be added down the line. Right now my pack is only on for a few hours as i walk around the neighborhood. Soon it will be my home away from home.SO many inspirational quotes have been read. Lots of journals entries consumed (can't wait to meet some of the people i have been following here). I won't offer any quotes but to say, ""life is amazing!"".I cannot thank my family and friends enough for their encouragement. Most of all I thank my wife, without her support this couldn't be fathomed let alone accomplished. So this is my last 'preparation blog'. Next time I make one of these entries I will be on the AT.

Despite a cold day of hiking in muddy conditions, the smile never left my face. Well, maybe a little on the last brutal climb of the day up Sassafras Mtn, but what a day!Have met a number of thru hikers and section hikers. People are so friendly on the Trail and it is so affirming. I finished by stealth camping under a full moon (and a whipping wind) with Fletch, Texas, Baloo, Pat and Dane. Everyone is attempting a NoBo and it was fun talking and storytelling with all these men of different ages, backgrounds, etc. Laughing a lot sure helps tired feet! Spirits are definitely high despite the inclement weather so a few of us are gonna try to log 12+ Miles tomorrow to get to Lance Creek and hope to find shelter in the coming days from some anticipated cold in the low teens.Life is amazing!Keep Walking!","Springer Mtn

Fletch & Baloo got a fire going (since the ""old guys"" were going to take some time and only do a few miles) and we ate breakfast full of anticipation. Packed up and started rocking -thru coopers gap, over justus Mtn, past ""the gooch!"", and on to Woody Gap.The Woody Gap trail was generally easy but the wind was tough. Very cold. Had my first ""Tolkien moment"" striding along the ridge as my mind wandered and melded with the surroundings.

Packed up all our wet gear and headed up the trail: thru Henry Gap, up Gaddis Mtn, past Woods Hole in driving snow thru Slaughter Creek and ascended Blood Mountain. A really tough climb in drifting snow and ice...Took a fall on icy rocks just past the Blood Mtn shelter but, thankfully, resulted in nothing more than a bruised butt (and a refocusing on balance with every step). The trip down Blood Mtn was taxing on the knees but we all arrived in Neels Gap in almost gleeful relief. The ""Boot Tree"", the ""AT Hallway"" thru Walasi Inn, the warm outfitter were all a most welcome sight. A warm cup of coffee and the promise of a cabin just down the road made spirits bright indeed. We checked into the Blood Mtn Cabins and Matt the proprietor made us feel right at home. Warm shower, hot pizza, a case of HighLife, and laundry service can do a lot to fix what ails a weary hiker!Everyone is a little sore and, given a high temp forecast of 25 tomorrow (and a low of 12), we decided to take a 'zero day' tomorrow and nurse the aches n pains.

Met up with Becca from MA and the super siblings, Bridge & Bran from VA as they were leaving Neel Gap hostel. We knocked out Cowlick Mtn and Testanee too. We ran into Chopsticks, Lucky, Gypsy J and Funky Moon for a group hike into the Gap where we all got our first Trail Magic! Hot coffee, sticky buns and other treats were a welcome second breakfast and much thanks to KingTutt and his crew. Special shout out to the ladies at First Bethlehem Methodist for free crocheted hats. (Mine is a cool camo hat with a white blaze!) So many thanks for the magic!!It was a beautiful day and we rolled on up over Hogpen Gap to Low Gap shelter where I was supposed to end my day at 11 miles. The super sibs were determined to make Blue Mtn & since the sun was shining and it was early, I pressed on. Got paced by Tipperary along the way and did 18.8 miles to Blue Mtn. I am worn out but smiling big. Met some really neat new folks today and hiked some beautiful forest in my home state in a tranquil snow covered landscape... simply divine.

Though the weather is beautiful, after a long day yesterday and some big Climbs today, I stopped early and will be staying here at the Tray Mountain Shelter. There is a privy, bear cables, fire pit, picnic table, and water source. Given rain in the forecast tonight I decided a roof might be just the ticket. (And Chayva, Alex, Scout, Lasagna, Tipperary, and a few others are all here too. Good fun folks from all over) Had more Trail magic this morning at Unicoi Gap. Keith made coffee, refilled my water, I took an apple and some Vaseline lip therapy and then hit the trail. Terrific views (for 15-20 miles) off Rocky Mountain and Indian Grave Gap.

There in the parking lot s church was cooking for hikers. I had two hamburgers, 2 hot dogs, Powerade, sweet tea & cookies. Holy Mackarel what a treat. God Bless Keith and his crew again. Once full, a few of us hied down the road to Top of GA hostel. A couple people had shipped resupply boxes there and I hoped to get a bunk but they were full. Several hikers that were unpacking their boxes gave me things they didn't want so at least I didn't need to buy more food. I hitched a ride back up the road and did about 4 more miles to plum orchard shelter. A long day but happy to be at the last shelter in Georgia.

We all cooked dinner (Lucky Cub had ramen noodles, mixed with mash potatoes & cheese crackers - looked awful but tasted pretty good. One day I'll do a post just on the Trail cuisine. It is nuts!) and went to bed early. I was asleep by 8:00pm (as I plan BIG miles tomorrow to get within striking distance of Franklin NC.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557168,"Big Miles...Woke up a little after 6am and began trying to quietly break down my tent and get packed up. Much easier said than done in the cold temps under a sky filled with stars. (Another future entry needs to be on the wilderness skies. Stars out here are so plentiful and brilliant. Thousands of them. The constellations leap from the dark...but I digress) Rolled out just minutes after 7am and started the remaining climb up Standing Indian Mtn. from the shelter. Watched the sunrise from the top and then descended into the burned landscape of 2016 forest fires. ""One does not simply walk into Mordor..."" kept echoing in my head. It was like a ghastly cemetery...the sun burned down on me like Sauron's eye... OK, you get the picture. But then who do I happen upon but Sweetspot, who had gotten up even earlier and hit the trail. She hiked fast & steady and that was the pace I needed for 'big miles' today. For hours we hiked running close to 3 mph chatting about all kinds of topics. Everything from best salad dressing to applications of hydrostatic pressure. Anything to smile away the miles. By lunch time we were almost 14 miles down the trail & beginning the climb up Albert Mtn. It is tough. The last 1/4 miles requires using hands to scramble up boulders but at the summit I met Clayrod, T-Bone, Bambi, TrapperJohnMD, Mr.Schist, Peter Pan, the brothers Rocket & Turtle, Red, Adele and Links. They were all sitting about with big silly grins. Several us climbed the fire tower (this gave me a bit of a scare to the stomach--It is WAY up there) and 'Holy Mackarel!' what a view. I could see Whiteside Mtn clear as day 24 miles to the east. Wave after wave of mountains lay before us in all directions. This spot is also a milestone for thru-hikers as it is the 100 mile mark and hence the bubble of hikers up top. I made a few quick calls and checked mail (there is cell service on the roof of the world) then headed out...knocked out 6 more miles and stealth camped on an old forest service road. (Shelter/Camp was full at mile 105.6) It was my first 20 mile day but totally worth it. Can easily get to FranklinNC tomorrow for a rest/recharge.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557178,"Slept great in a quiet stealth spot in Wallace Gap. Another early morning but no need to be quiet and no hurry as I brewed up coffee and made my oatmeal. (Mmmm, Apple cinnamon) I packed up and headed out with an easy destination. 4 miles away lay Hwy64 and a crossing 15 miles west of Franklin, NC. Most of the hostels send shuttles out there about 9am & 11am and I knew I needed to catch one of them. It was a beautiful hike with a glorious sunrise off to my right throughout. I got to the roadside and met several other thruhikers I hadn't met yet that were all thinking like me. Water boy, Lumberjack, Clubs, Non-stop, Mel-TBD, carmen Sandiego, and TwinkleToes all introduced themselves and we passed the time talking of what civilized joys we most looked forward to in Franklin. Suffice to say, it's the simple things like showers and toilets that we crave. (And beer. Don't think for one second that wasn't in everyone's mind) Actually, it's one of the most endearing aspects of a journey like this: you see the magic in the basic necessities and realize how much you take for granted in life. Life is amazing. Don't take it for granted. Ron Haven drove a full bus of hikers into town. This guy knows what hikers want and need. His little outpost in Franklin helps make this such a hiker friendly stop. I got a spot at BaltimoreJacks place on Derby street. After having a great shower, washing everything I own, getting a few pints at the Rock Lodge with other hikers, and downing lots of yummy foodstuffs... I have decided to stay here and do ZERO miles tomorrow!
Cheers to Franklin NC!! Ps- the picture is not from today. It is my lunch spot yesterday. It was so amazing I had to use it, though even a 'panorama' camera setting cant do this panorama justice.","Wallace Gap

When one wakes late, showers, goes and eats a huge breakfast and then waits to eat a huge lunch, etc...I woke up and put all my cleaned clothes/gear all back in my pack. Went to the Kountry Kitchen and Mama Bear and Lil' Badass asked me to join them for breakfast. They were headed back to the trail today on the 11am shuttle but I hope to see them again in the coming weeks. Over coffee I worked on my logistics for the coming weeks. After breakfast, I went to see the super helpful folks at Three Eagles Outfitters and they assisted me in getting the required backcountry permit printed to hike in Great Smoky Mtn Nat. Park. (hope to be there in about 4-5 days and had to do this while technology was available)Later, the boys I started my hike with arrived on the late shuttle. Cool! So Baloo, Gaston (Pat's new trail name from Beauty n the Beast), Chip, Easy, and I all headed to eat a big Mexican lunch and hoist a few cervecas. Delicious! Then we hit the Dollar General for some supplies and I picked up a paperback* at the thrift store (nice lady let me have it for free) we walked by. Tonight we will hit the Lazy Hiker Brewery down the street for trivia night (they are excited to have me play with them since I'm old and know lots of old people stuff) and I should be sleeping pretty early as the plan is to hike on and up over Wayah Bald tomorrow. (This was ground zero of the 2016 arson attack on the southern forests.)It has been so nice resting here in Franklin. The town is relaxed & the people warm.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557502,"Enough Zero time... gotta breakaway from the comfort and get back on the trail! Ron Haven drove me back 15 miles west of Franklin to the trail head at Winding Stair Gap. My legs felt really strong and I planned to ease back into things with an 11 mile day. I climbed up to the top of Siler Bald first. Terrific views for miles. The NC balds are a bit of an enigma. No definite reason for the existence of the grassy opens at the top of the mountains though most believe it was cleared for livestock a long long time ago. I ran into 'Tennessee Creeper' up there and she encouraged me to ditch the pack and go way up top for the view. So worth it! (Happy to say I would see this section hiker again over the coming days. Her and husband Waldo are super nice folks)I got loaded up and headed in another 6 miles to Wayah Bald. It has an old stone tower up top but was site of an Arson attack last fall that burned it up. Very sad to see trees blackened and fried 50 ft up. It'll be a generation before it comes back sadly but the views from the top were stellar. TBone, Goose, Andes and a few other hikers there taking in the vista. Some were eating, others jamming as the mountains inspired them. A nice place to rest before descending back into the charred forest. I had planned to stop here but the sun was shining and I wanted greenery so I hoofed it up another five miles to one of the oldest shelters on the trail at cold springs. A cool log cabin built in the 1930's by the CCC with a clear cold spring in front. I filtered some water and decided to tent a few 100 yds up the ridge. Terrific campsite with great views. Met Rosebud and Thorn (retirees- they thru-hiked in 2007), Daba-doo, and a few sectionhikers. We built a nice fire and stayed up late. I didn't get to bed until after 9pm!

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557546,"Quite a day. Mrs Tennessee Creeper gave me some bacon and with that began a tough day but a magical one as well. Pretty hard climbs today through sections that were more difficult than anticipated. The burned out trail only adds to the complexity of the hike. There are hollows and slides to be navigated and the terrain ""feels"" a little dead. It saps your energy quickly and gives the impression it is biting at your feet. However, after a tough climb out of Tellico Gap, I got to the top of the ridge, past Wesser Bald, and lo-n-behold, right on a rock by a scenic overlook sat a cold can of Miller Lite. I know not what Angel of heaven left it there but it was quite delicious and as sweet as any trail magic yet. So thank you kind hiker whoever you are. It made my day!Rejuvenated, I danced down the steep rocks into Rufus Morgan shelter and pitched camp. Since it was early, I took my empty pack and went a mile down to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) where my first resupply box was waiting. Picked it up, got a six pack of craft beers at the RiverBar, and hiked back up to camp. Goose and Andes had arrived while I was gone so we each had a couple of beers and talked for awhile until other hikers showed up. It was good to repay the beer karma and look forward to going into the NOC tomorrow.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557577,"Woke up and headed to the NOC --along with everyone else in camp. The allure of a big cooked breakfast was pretty powerful. They sat us in back of restaurant (as all the hikers smell pretty ripe) and we had a great time. Big mugs of coffee, hash brown scrambles, the works. I must admit Trail food just can't compare to this sort of thing. 
After breakfast I paid $2 and got shower access. It was great. (Granted I'm stinky again after the day's hard hike but it was nice to feel human again!) After getting clean I milled around the NOC, charged my phone, and watched the Olympic trials for kayaking. Pretty cool stuff! I've never been able to Kayak but it looks like a ball. After eating a little food from my now giant bear bag (thanks to the resupply) A few of us began the ascent out of the NOC. This was a long day of mostly uphill as the next 6+ miles gained 3,300 ft. of elevation. I reached the shelter at about 4pm and got one of the last spots. Generally I avoid the shelter but the chance of rain tonight is assured and, though I'll hike in the rain all day tomorrow at least my tent won't be a wet mess to pack up in the morning. (Wet=heavy). It is 6:45pm and I am readying myself for bed. Once the sun drops in the next half hour it'll be sleeping time for the dozens of hikers here (14 in the double decker shelter).

(Thankfully the mice in the shelter spent last night messing with the top bunk rather than those of us on the lower level) Hiked in the fog over Cheoah Bald (over 5,000 ft) then descended below the ceiling to see clouds settled amongst the lower Mtn valleys. Simply beautiful. Unfortunately the trail took a tough path of descent and the slippery AT sent me down hard on my butt. Nothing but a bruise but boy did I 'slow my roll' after that smackdown. Ate lunch at Stecoah Gap then had to make the long hard haul up Jacob's Ladder. The elevation gain is almost 1000 feet over 6/10ths of a mile and it had me hugging and puffing.

Once over the top, I knew the next shelter was my destination given storm clouds on the horizon (& am in striking distance of hiking into Fontana dam tomorrow). Rained for several hours once I was set up in the shelter so I feel fortunate to have stopped when I did. Will be toting a dry pack out in the morning.

The morning ritual is different for everyone but all involve the same items: pulling down bear bags, packing up sleep systems, and prepping for the day's miles. I had my usual breakfast--heat 2 cups of water, pour a cup of instant coffee in my Zig mug, add freeze dried berries and two instant oatmeal packs to the remaining water in cook pot. Demolish it in moments, clean pan (drink dirty oat water--leave no trace!), pack it up. Next, shoved my lunch in my pockets (protein bars, stinger waffles, chocolate, etc) and got the rainfly on the pack. ( chance of showers) Though it was about 50 degrees, I left in a tshirt as I knew the first climb would heat me up quick. After about a mile I was above low fog and the view was breathtaking. The Smokies gave me a little preview of their name as the valleys lay ensconced in Smoky clouds with the tops just peeking through. The rest of the morning hike was like a dream. The damp fetid leaves were pungent and absorbed the sound of my footfalls. Birds songs echoed through the forest in the early morning light. As I made more miles and dropped in elevation towards Fontana Dam, little yellow and white flowers became abundant. Farther down small forest orchids were beginning to bloom by the thousands. Though a long walk today, it was inspiring. Look forward to GSMNPnlater this week. Thankfully, given being slightly ahead of schedule, I am checked in the Fontana Lodge and enjoying being clean.

We were joined that night in the shelter by Ryhs, Hodge Podge, Waterboy, Carmen SanDiego, Daba-doo, Turtle and a few section hikers.

Tried to get my camera out but startled it in the process and it exploded into flight. Super cool. I suppose it was an omen as the day got really windy and spitting rain as I scaled Rocky Top. The balds were reminiscent of the British isles and the wind kept pushing me around.After 3 hours or so I was really whipped. My body, and even my will to keep going, we're finished. I limped into a shelter at mile 9 for the day just dejected. I decided to make my coffee & oatmeal and started setting up a spot. Then, in walked Hodge Podge and Two Dogs. Both were in super spirits and their energy was contagious. The coffee and oatmeal lifted me a little and their attitudes did the rest! I packed up and began chugging down the trail with them. Renewed energy propelled me another 5.7 miles in almost no time. We stopped on Siler's Bald and the sun came out for the first time all day.

Since I am planning to be in Gatlinburg this weekend I did not need to do big miles today. The forecast called for clearing about 10am so I just laid in the warm bag as the intrepid milers kept putting on rain gear and heading out. Finally about 10'am I headed out... A wonderful, albeit very wet, trail didn't disappoint as the forest began to turn to conifers on the approach to Clingman's Dome, the highest elevation on the AT. We hit the summit just before noon but all views were obscured by clouds. Hodge Podge, Goose, Andes and I made some tea and relished a moment being the highest folks on the entire trail. (The road for cars doesn't open until April -tomorrow- so we had the mountain to ourselves) we finally headed out and passed the 200 mile mark on the slope of Mt. Love.

My shoes were full of water by mile 7 and by mile 10 my rain suit was beginning to 'wet out'. I pulled in to the TriCorner shelter at 12 mile mark when I heard thunder in the distance and found Naps and Two Dogs already inside their sleeping bags at 12:45pm.

Went up and over Mt Guyot the first two miles out of camp and it was all in a golden glow. Then traversed Snake Den Ridge and on to the last big mountain in the Smokies, Mt. Cammerer. Hammered out 12 miles before noon, including a long stop on backside of Cammerer where I just sat awestruck with 50+ mile views and a lone bird singing. (It was one of those magic moments we have in our lives that I won't ever forget.) A few miles later I reached the last shelter in GSMNP and had planned to stop...but Moses and Bunn were there and convinced me that another 3-4 miles or so of hiking was worth it to reach ""the farm"".

Casually ate breakfast with Ryhs, Naps, & Two Dogs before finally packing up and heading out about 8:45. My legs felt good and I rocked the first four miles up Snowbird Mtn at a good clip. The views were nice from the Bald but the wind was picking up and rain clouds were moving in fast. I didn't tarry at the top and before long I was stopping to throw on rain gear. By the time I was ten miles in, the thunder was booming and sleet was pelting me. As lightning popped, i passed by Dabba-Doo and Waterboy who had thrown up a tarp and ducked for cover. I kept going since we were still low on the Mtn but admittedly was getting worried. ""Shit!""

Pissed off, I soldiered on and what should happen at the base of the Max Patch trail but...TRAIL MAGIC! Yep, Chimney and his pops, SuperDad were celebrating SuperDads birthday with HotDogs, Chili, Boiled P-Nuts, cupcakes and sodas for all the hikers.

(At least the mice didn't bother us in the shelter.) In the pre-dawn hours other shelter dwellers got up and hauled it quick out of camp. We are only about 18 miles from HotSprings, NC and most folks want to get there. Add in some forecasted bad weather, and it was an early exodus for most. A few of us just sat watching it happen and left later. It was cold, my feet are really sore, and I wasn't planning on big miles. But it started snowing while us slow folks cooked breakfast so we realized it was time to show a little hustle. Hit the trail at 8:30am and it was slow going. Wet n cold makes for a slippery muddy trail. Climbed Walnut Mtn slowly feeling sluggish. Then climbed Bluff Mtn and was hammered by snow and 40 mph winds. It was an amazing storm and the whipping ol' Mother Nature was delivering made me realize I needed to go ahead and start thinking about getting to town TODAY. As I dropped down in elevation to Gareflo Gap the storm subsided (to just flurries) but you could see all the Mtns were socked in above 3500 ft. I slogged on until the town came in to sight. Wow! So nice to follow the AT right into town. The trail markers are imbedded in the sidewalk right down Main Street and continue over the French Broad River. Obviously all the business cater to hikers too. I had run in to Tyler about a mile from town and we walked in together both anticipating warmth and food. The first restaurant we saw had Moses and Bunn standing on the porch so we headed in. Two hours later we left... I had Fried Chicken livers with fried okra, mac-n-cheese, and Cornbread. When I finished, I had a grilled cheese & bacon. Then an apple pie. (Hard to believe I've lost 9 pounds already and I'm a human garbage disposal!) Delicious comfort food on a rainy cold day.

What a way to start a zero day.Yesterday's slight dilemma (during our 'diner extravaganza') was figuring out where to stay. The stormy forecast had driven many hikers into town and both hostels were full. The first three hotels/ motels we called were full too. Tyler called the Magnolia Inn and, incredibly, they had a two bedroom suite available and offered a hiker rate. By the time we split the bill my cost was less than they charged at the run-down motor lodge in town. Score! And, though Tyler was headed back to the trail after breakfast and the suite wasn't available for tonight, the Inn put me up about a mile out of town in their little ""hideaway house"" overlooking the French Broad River for even less. Score again!With my lodging set, I went about ""zero tasking"": took all my dirty stuff to laundromat and cleaned it up, went resupply shopping, dropped in to the local outfitter and got a replacement sleeping pad (aarrggh), went to post office to mail some cards, went to library, went to the tavern... While this sounds kind of monotonous, being in a little AT town it was quite a lot of fun. Hikers were everywhere! When I walked into any business I was surrounded by people I knew. Walking by shops I heard knocks on windows and got waves and smiles. This roving band of 'hiker trash' is a fun community. We've endured some tough miles to get this far and, while it is a grand melting pot of all types of people, our shared communal experience binds us together. There is a desire by everyone I've met to lend a helping hand. Such a positive affirmation in a world that often seems so mean with people at odds. Maybe carrying a pack and worrying about the basics makes the world a better place. Then again, maybe everyone was just happy they weren't carrying their damn packs and they got to use a toilet today! Whatever the case, I sure did need a day like today to rest and recharge.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560356,"Easter morning I woke up in the Treehouse at Mountain Harbor Hostel. Packed up the gear and headed up to the main house for breakfast. Holy Mackarel, what a spread! We ate our fill of the delicious treats (Eggs, Biscuits n gravy, French toast, sausage, Ham, potatoes, fruits, desserts, etc) and then waddled back to the trailhead. Rolled up the Roan Valley slowly and began to hit a number of big waterfalls before dropping down to the Elk River and hitting mile marker FOUR HUNDRED!! Felt a little monumental to hit the 400 and it pepped my step for a few miles. By noon it was hot and when I got to Mountaineer Falls I took a dip to cool off (took about 5 seconds!) and who should arrive at the Falls asi was heading back down but The Dude. We had 'lost him' coming out of Erwin as he hung back with some folks but we hiked the rest of the day and ended up doing over 18 miles again today. Pretty exhausted the last few miles but a yummy spinach salad (compliments of Seed) and a pot of Alfredo Noodles (compliments of Hodge Podge) goes a long way to fixing what ails you. Now a hot cup of tea, some journaling, and Easter Sunday on the AT is drawing to a close.Life is amazing--- be thankful!","Mountain Harbor Hostel

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560508,"""Aaarrgghh"" - Charlie BrownAn apropos quote given my feet when I awoke today. A toe on each foot (left #3, right #2) has been bothering me for a few days and, though the right foot toe seems to have toughened up, the left one was swollen and brutally painful this morning. I struggled to get my shoe on and doubt crept in and took hold. How was I going to walk, let alone hike, if I can't even put a shoe on?"" Well, I walked and figured I might just go slow but as I continued to hike the pain subsided enough to ""Keep Walking"". We hiked into the Pond Wilderness and past Laurel Falls and over some great trails along the river this morning doing about 10 miles. However, any illusion of BIG miles today was out the window. And with afternoon thunderstorms in the forecast, a decision was made to pop a mile off trail into Hampton, TN. What a stroke of luck that we scored $15 bunks at the coolest hostel around, Braemer Castle. Run by Sutton Brown, this big stone house built in 1909 has been in his family since the '30's. We are here with about 1/2 dozen other hikers and it is great. (Comfy bed, great shower, they did our laundry, the common room has movies, kitchens up and downstairs, WiFi!, etc) So nice to rest the feet before the push into Damascus. A few housekeeping items to touch on while I have good internet:1) Mail drops- I've been asked by a number of people about mailing things to me but the trouble is the ""house on my back"" is not recognized by the USPS. I'm unable to say when & where I may be next as my plan is pretty fluid (like an unexpected town stop today). Thanks so much for thinking of me and I really appreciate the thought. I will try to publish a future address {with a weeks notice} as I move into Virginia if you want to drop me a line. 2) Music- I've been asked various music questions. Yes, I carry an iPod. I have over 15,000 songs on it so the selection is pretty varied. There hasn't been a particular 'favorite' but, on that note, think I am going to start noting the daily 'impact' songs. For example, ""Year of the Cat"" really moved me the other day as I went through a wildflower field and I was singing Old Crow Medicine Show's ""Wagon Wheel"" at the top of my lungs hiking up a Bald two days ago. Music is so powerful and, while I don't have my headphones on all the time, it enhances moments. 3) Bears - no, I haven't seen one...yet4) Trail Terrain- many of my pictures show vistas or ridges because it is cool but, most of the time, I am in southern appalachian forest just trudging along. It is roots, rocks, and mud. It is very hard on the feet. There is not a lot of technical climbing where I use my hands (though I had to today scrambling around cliffs over whitewater--really rad) but there are moments. Elevation can be grueling. Most of the states I've been in so far shun the use of switchbacks so it is just up and over. Throw some snow or rain on the trail and it is really hard. 5) Thank You's - I cannot thank all of you, my family and friends, enough. To say your support means so much sounds hollow but it couldn't be more true. I think of you each and every day and you are truly here with me. THANKS!6) Beard - yes, I look ridiculous. No, I've never done this before. Yes, I'm letting it go. No, they don't call me Joe Dirt. Yes, perhaps they should. And yes, dear Anna, one day it'll look like Gandalf!Ok...that's it for nowLife is Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious --- keep walking!","Moreland Gap Shelter

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560637,"Woke up after a fun night at Braemer Castle and was ready to rock. Thankfully my feet felt pretty good this morning and I put new insoles (green superfeet) in my shoes to see if that helps my toes. Alex gave us a lift back to the trail head at Lake Watauga and we began our ascent up to Wilbur Dam. It was stormy last night and a light rain was trying to fall but the sun burnt it off and the damp trail was a joy as it hadn't turned to mud yet. Walked the first 7 miles chatting with Namaste and the miles flew by. We stopped for lunch and Hodge Podge and Big Style joined us. (The folks already hanging around at the place we stopped were a little sketchy so we didn't stay long)We all spaced apart over the miles in our afternoon hiking and I rocked along with the headphones in. Songs that really jumped out and fit the moments today:1)David Bowie- Chant of the ever circling skeletal family. (Just started as cresting hill overlooking Lake Watauga.)2) Gordon Lightfoot- minstrel of the Dawn (walking thru rhododendrons to the water source. Really peaceful)3) mick Jagger- sweet thing (cruising down the longest 'straight path' section I've seen yet. Basically danced down it)Hit the Iron Mtn Shelter at 3pm. Only folks here were Papa Bear and his 8 yr old daughter, Rumble Stumble. Decided to pull in as the sky was darkening. Hodge Podge pulled in a few minutes later. Rain started as others arrived. Some just had tea and moved on in the rain {as they are all pushing for Virginia} while Namaste, Circus, Naps, Solomon, Still Steve, Renegade and Scout all stayed here. It is a little chilly tonight as the rains came in and I'm happy to be under the tin roof. Hopefully the mice won't be too crazy tonight.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560892,"Rainy morning and everyone seemed to be in a hustle to get going. I laid in bed listening to the rain and finally got myself going on the trail about 9:15... The trail climbed back along the ridge and I found myself more IN the clouds than being rained on by them. It was damp and foggy... but half light and dripping silence made for a nice hike. I caught up with little Rumble Stumble (in her dads raincoat!) and her dad, Papa Bear fairly quickly and passed by as they were just strolling along. They were looking to get a ride to Damascus at the road crossing and hopefully they also got the TRAIL MAGIC that 8-Track was doing at Hwy 91. (Big ol' shout out and thank you for the oranges, strawberries, and cookies). 
The forest turned to rolling farmlands and the sun came out as I walked through the fields. Watching the clouds rise up out of the valleys in the sunshine was terrific and made for an easy afternoon of exploring the Tennessee woods. Old stone walls, flowering trees, and winter vistas not yet obscured by spring made for a picturesque landscape. 
Stopped at the last shelter in Tennessee (as it was only 10 miles from Damascus) and enjoyed a good spring and sunshine to air out all my gear from the mornings dampness. Everyone is exuding an excited air of giddy anticipation as they know we hit a new state tomorrow & a chance to roll through a 'trail town'. Lots of laughs at dinner with Sonny (aka White Gravy), Bloomer, HodgePodge, Namaste, Trainwreck, Young Giraffe, Solomon, Naps, etc.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561070,"After arriving in a very cool trail town, pretty much everybody takes a ""zero"" (or two) to rest, recharge, and prepare for the next leg of the journey. The town of Damascus, VA is one of, if not THE, Best trail towns in America. It is actually considered 'Trail Town, USA' and home to the Trail Days festival next month. There are a number of reputable [and infamous] hostels here as well as beautiful bed & breakfast options. My 'bubble' is one that likes to rest, as opposed to party all night*, and so most of them went for the Woodchuck hole Hostel. Pretty great place designed by and for the Thru hiker. (*Those seeking a bit more boisterous late night fare usually go to The Broken Fiddle or Crazy Larrys. Also excellent establishments) With shuttles to all you can eat pizza (yeah, I ate 20+ pieces of zza) or the local grocery, and a breakfast included... well, this is a popular place. Some are here recuperating from injury (Flatfoot will be out rocking again in days, and Nemo is getting some flexibility in that knee) and others are just waiting/rebuilding their hiking groups that had gotten spread out since leaving the Smokies. Mostly it is a chance to sleep in a real bed, use a washing machine, eat some ice cream, pick up some resupply, have access to a full bathroom, and do it ALL without wearing hiking boots. Some headed back out on the trail today, others are just arriving. I'm doing ""special rest"" this weekend and will journal that 'Amazingness' on Sunday evening.","Woodchuck Hole Hostel

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561305,"Well, dear journal readers, i have been holding out on you. My ruse was necessary for keeping the element of surprise and even my last post was not entirely accurate. I did take a zero day but i was not in Damascus Virginia...On Thursday, we all came rolling into Trail Town USA and stopped at Woodchuck Hole Hostel. I did have a reservation for Thursday but changed it to Sunday night as I had formulated a plan to go home and spend some time with my family. After diving into AYCE pizza on thursday and walking about town, Renegade & I had Enterprise rent-a-car come pick us up from Abingdon VA and we headed south. About 9:30pm, Renegade dropped me off and he headed on down to Macon and I walked up my driveway and into the kitchen... Big Hugs and smiles. WOW! Had a shower and slept in my own bed with my own pillow. Sweet luxury after more than a month in the woods.Friday I did 'zero'... in ATLANTA. Started with a bang when i surprised my neighbors--you would have thought Patt had seen a ghost when i walked down the driveway. Speechless! So great to see them and get a chance to hug part of my 'support team'. Then went to REI and got some things i needed, ran some other errands, and popped in to visit all the fine folks at CFG. They were surprised and it was SO good to see all those smiling faces! For the better part of the last two decades, i have had the great fortune of working side by side with really amazing folks and, even though it can be taxing and frustrating at times (it IS work after all), I miss the camaraderie. Hiking is a lonely business but my work was always a team effort. CFG is so great because of that team effort and the great care & respect of all its team members. Oh yeah...and they had cupcakes. I forgot how much i like eating treats in the breakroom too. Eventually i tore myself away from the reunion (and cupcakes!) and headed home. Went out to lunch with Jenny & Jake. We sat outside on a glorious spring day eating fried oysters. Now every 'zero' is a welcome respite but, sitting there on that porch, with a gentle breeze blowing over my clean cotton shirt, and my wife and son on either side of me, was ecstasy. I felt so happy i was about to burst. I had originally questioned whether or not it was wise to get 'so far away' from my hike but it was definitely the right choice. After lunch we went and picked up Anna from school and went home to hang out. Family time rules! Likewise, I was able to wash & treat all my clothes with Pemetherin (tick poison), clean my pack, wash my down coat and sleeping bag, dump some winter gear, etc.What better way to follow up a fantastic friday than to DOUBLE ZERO! Saturday morning I got up, had coffee, pulled my hair up into a weird hairdo, put on Jake's mirror shades and headed up to DCC to see my tennis team play its last regular season match. (A trip to ALTA City playoffs was hanging in the balance too) I sat down on the far side of the courts and cheered incognito for a few points. Eventually i was recognized and it was great to catch up with my teammates. Lots of smiles while also watching them take all 5 points against a tough team. Well Done--- go get 'em guys. I am pulling for you to bring home that 2017 AA-2 City Championship!In the afternoon the whole family went out for smoothies, Anna and I did some practice driving (she is a great driver and look forward to that learner's permit becoming a real driver's license this summer!), and we ate a wonderful meal.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562108,"Rolled out of the A-T-L on Sunday and we drove through pouring rain all the way to Virginia. We got picked up in Abingdon and dropped back at Woodchuck Hole Hostel in Damascus. Chuck, the proprietor, brought us in and got us set up with a good bed. Slept great and woke up Monday ready to go. But more cloudy yucky rainy drizzly mess awaited. But they say, ""No pain, No rain, No Maine"" so I wasn't gonna hide from it any more. I walked through Damascus and crossed swollen rivers and knew a muddy day awaited Up in the mountains. Made good time the first few miles and ran into some trail friends I hadn't seen in awhile; Goose and Andes. Fun to catch up and hear about their hike (everyone is on the same trail but you 'hike your own hike' and we all get something different). Shortly we came across a young man trudging back toward Damascus. The fool had tried to cross a washout up ahead and lost all his gear, including his eyeglasses. Frankly, he is lucky he survived. I looked at the crossing and can't imagine anyone thinking they could cross it. At least 20 ft across, 4-6 ft deep, all rushing, cascading white water... crazy. (We detoured around the river downstream per the posted warning signs he had ignored) Rest of the day was up into the Mount Rogers Wilderness. This is the gateway to the Grayson Highlands and everyone is excited to see one of the most fabled sections of the Appalachian Trail as there are wild ponies here. I stopped about 15 miles in at Lost Mtn as more rain expected. Met a number of new hikers (after my triple zero) so I sheltered with McGyver (a Georgia boy that went to my elementary school--what are the odds??), Bob Dylan, Wonder Woman, OhCanada, Finnisher, Rocketeer, BamBam, Little Badass, Goose and Andes. Hopefully Mother Nature will blow away the rain and give us some sun in the Highlands!

Woke up hoping to do big miles and big smiles today but the weather was overcast n drizzle. The trail was a mess. Basically it was like walking in a river and so you are hopping from rock to root to rock trying to keep your feet dry. Impossible. In a nutshell: shitty. I was not having fun, I fell for the first time in ages. Then snagged and tore my pack. A little while later I fell again! Yep, just shitty. I was muttering and cursing as I past through Elks Garden. This marks the point when it's possible to see ponies. Nothing. Even a fool horse has sense not to be out in this! Up over Mount Rogers and NO views. Just more mist, clouds, and rain. And then, I round a bend and what do I see but a wild pony. And she has a newborn foal not three days old with her. Holy Mackarel! It was AWESOME! No sooner had I just given up on the day then it all turned around. Funny how life works, eh?Moments later, I met Little Foot and Mama Bear. I spent the rest of the day hiking with them and, over those next few miles, we would see more than a dozen ponies. Little Foot is the youngest Thru-hiker I have met so far. He is 5 and he is SO cool. Bundle of energy. As I kept trying to pick my way around puddles, he'd just splash right through them. We went through the ""lemon squeezer"", a boulder formation that is really narrow. He just trucked right through & said it's easy because he is a ""wittle person"". The day went from 'shitty overcast' to 'magical mist'. Sometimes we need to see the world through a child's eyes and I'm so thankful to have met this intrepid little hiker.

Clear skies made the breakfast taste better and the packing quicker. Said goodbye to LittleFoot who told me, ""Just watch and follow the white blazes."" Happy Trails little guy & will do!The morning hike was glorious as I walked thru the gorse bushes and passed by ponies with their tails and manes aglow in the sunrise. As I climbed out of the state park, the clouds settled below the highland balds, and the surrounding mountain tops poked through like islands floating in the white shroud. Mother Nature had dialed up a ten and I found myself spinning across the Highlands as I constantly turned round to take it all in. Walked thru a herd of Longhorn cattle near 'The Scales' and found the first five miles today as enjoyable as anything thus far. (On that note, ""thus far"" has started to become pretty far as I passed the 500 mile mark(!) yesterday amongst the ponies. Someone made the marker out of pony poop. LittleFoot thought that was hilarious. Must admit I thought that was pretty clever too) The miles just spun out behind me today in the wake of my smiles and I never even stopped for lunch. I left the Highlands and entered the Raccoon Wilderness, climbed past Comers Creek Falls, thru Dickeys Gap, and eventually reached a great place to camp by a flowing spring near the Trimpi Shelter. One of the guys tenting nearby played guitar by the campfire as I fell asleep tonight. What a day--- knocked out 20+ miles and had a perma-grin the whole time. Life is Amazing---Keep on Truckin'!
Two different songs struck me today:
First, walking on the Bald at sunrise, I actually pressed replay and listened to it twice because it was such a perfect soundtrack to the moment: No Ordinary Love by Sade. (So smooth so sweet)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562555,"Sunrise at the Chestnut Knob Shelter was glorious. Shelter life always starts early and we ate breakfast while watching the daybreak above the highest mountain valley in Virginia. From this high point, the AT drops down off Garden Mtn. and circles the valley along the ridge through the ""Burks Garden"" rock formation. (Pretty interesting terrain as this valley is a collapsed limestone crater.) While not a difficult hike from an elevation or terrain standpoint, I had a rough go of it. The previous day was a very hot one and I drank all my water at the shelter (normally leave with a liter each morning). 2-3 miles in I was thirsty. About 6 miles into the day I was hurting. At 8 miles, I was dragging and each potential water source was dry. It took almost 10 miles to reach water. I drank a lot and carried more out--I know, I know... lesson learned: carry extra water. 
Of course, the day got so much better with hydration! The next five miles were easy and I enjoyed a solitary walk through the sun dappled Virginia woods. Saw two large Pileated Woodpeckers (always cool to see, even as they 'laughed' at me with their distinct call) as I dropped down to the bridge over Laurel Creek. This is a big creek (25-30 ft across) with a series of falls and I saw Naps, Solomon, and Still Steve out in the water. I joined them in the chilly water and relished the chance to soak my feet. The guys moved on shortly with plans for a dozen more miles. I sat and decided to camp up the hill. Sure there was lots of daylight left but why rush? I felt tired and the water was soothing. Eventually Chopsticks, Bulletproof, Namaste, and Mantis came along and took advantage of 'the waterpark' too and we all stealth camped at various spots within the forest around Laurel Creek. Life is Amazing. Keep Walking...and carry water!
Couple good song moments today: 1. Don't Panic by Coldplay came on about 30 seconds before I reached the water I needed. Indeed ""We live in a beautiful world""2.

Several other hikers were lounging about and I could see more coming as I got to SR615 at Laurel Creek. The reason for the gathering? Well, the local Methodist church in Bland, VA does a free breakfast for hikers on Monday morning and this is the pick up spot. Miss Anne, aka ""Hiker One"", arrived at 8:45 and took the first batch of us about five miles west into town. Ultimately, they would provide 'all you can eat' breakfast to 14 of us. I cannot express enough gratitude for their charitable kindness. We all relished the delicious choices that their AT Chaplaincy provided. One gentleman even refilled my cook fuel canister so I wouldn't need to go into town and buy more.

For hours i slogged through the rain but no worries ...for I had a full belly and a big smile. I saw salamanders, snails, and more wild azaleas than one could count. Despite the moisture it was a great hike and I went farther than planned walking until after 6:00pm. I don't usually walk that late but I wanted to be sure I camped near water.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562899,"The winds that blew out yesterday's rain were chilly ones. Such a nice reprieve from the heat and a reminder that I'm still in the mountains. Got rolling early enough to do 6.5 miles to Trent's Gas Station/Deli by 10am. While I didn't need a lot of resupply, I did need electricity to recharge my phone so I plugged in next to the ice machine and hung out for an hour+. Ate a few BLT's too...delicious!Rolled out juiced up and hiked up the trail to Dismal Creek Falls. Very nice swimming hole but, given the chilly winds, a swim wasn't in the cards today. I headed on up the trail sticking to my morning plan {of 14.5miles today}  and got to Wapiti Shelter by 3:30 in the afternoon. The day was too pretty and the winds to fair to give up the hike so I decided to fill up my water bottles and move on. I made the climb up Pearis Mtn. And was rewarded with spectacular views of the Wilburn Valley. Mottled greens below from the puffy clouds above, I felt as if I was placed in a painting. Continuing on over the 20 mile mark on the day my feet began to tire out and I limped into the fabulous Woods Hole Hostel after 6pm. They restored my body and soul with a clean comfy bed, a hot shower, and an unparalleled Farm-to-table meal. Here is life in a sustainable living environment beyond compare. Without question the finest place I have come across yet on the AT. Though it was not planned, I am going to Zero here tomorrow and enjoy this slice of heaven on Earth. So glad I "" fell into the Hole""!

It was a beautiful day and we all lounged around in the early morning. As the sun moved higher in the sky it was time to get to work so The Dude (an excellent young man from Fayetteville AR) and I shoveled gravel out behind the hostel to build a new path to the vegetable garden. Afterwards we moved the brush piles from the field by the pig pens down to the burn pile by the river. Good to help out around the farm and feel apart of this intriguing communal hostel. During the day, Otter checked in. (A very nice young woman that broke her foot in NC and had to take 4 weeks off but she is back and loving the trail.) Ravioli, Maneater, BoBo, and company soon followed. We all went to eat at the Mexican restaurant in town and had a terrific meal. Loads of laughs and calories! It was also nice to find time to talk with Neville, the hostel owner, about the trail joiurney as well as the journey of life.
Overall, it was a much needed rest and my mind/body feels so much better and the ""grind"" of the latest miles seem to be behind me.Time to get back to focusing on being present in the moment.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563283,"So after taking a Zero day yesterday I knew I had to get out of 'the Hole'. My amazing wife had mailed a resupply box and some NEW SHOES to a Pearisburg Hostel and getting those was important. Looking at the weather created a conundrum. Wicked rain storms expected in the late afternoon and continuing through the night. Aarrghh. It was only 10 or so miles and easy enough to beat but I'd also want to get out of the storms. Why stay in Pearisburg when I was already hanging in the coolest hostel around??
The answer came in the form of a ""slack pack"". I'd leave the hostel with a bottle of water, some snacks, and a rain coat in a little pack and Neville's husband Micheal would pick me up in Pearisburg and bring me back to 'the Hole'. Perfect. It was fun doing some tough miles up over Doc's Knob & Angels Rest without carrying an extra 30+ lbs on my pack. I moved fast and light. Ran into Young Giraffe as I got close to town and we hitched a ride in the back of a pick up truck to the hostel where he stayed and I got my mail. Then I walked back to the meet up spot. Micheal showed up a few minutes later and we headed back - running a few errands on the way. Excellent. 
When I got back to the Hostel I found LOADS of familiar faces I hadn't seen in weeks had arrived. Lots of hikers I celebrated my birthday with in The Smokies had finally caught up. We had 21 of us at dinner and it was a really fun evening.

Got up, ate another incredible breakfast, put on my NEW Shoes, and Micheal shuttled me down to the trailhead in Pearisburg. I felt great early in and was able to call home and talk to Jenny as I headed up the mountain. Unfortunately, despite great weather, I became sluggish as the trail broke my spirit. I try to point out and focus on the positives each day (and in these journal entries) but let's face it: we all have crappy days sometimes. I spilled my water, I took a hard fall, and I just felt like quitting this stupid hike all day. The shelter I was going to stop at was closed (due to gypsy moth infestation killing all the trees around it. No staying with all these ""widowmakers"" about- thanks a lot you damn moths) and the day was abysmal. I was forced to walk another couple tough miles searching for a campsite when I came to The Captains. The AT strikes again. The Captains is a trail legend. It's not a hostel. This ol Vet let's people camp in his yard and provides cold free drinks in the frig on his back porch. To get there I had to take a zip line across Stoney Creek and it saved the day. I pitched my tent on the level grass, grabbed a cold beer, and cooked dinner with a couple German guys as well as Bad Santa, Maps, Renegade, Reroute, Bobo, and Scratch.

It rained hard in the night and was still raining when I got up. Rats. It was cold and wet as I packed up my soaked gear and headed back down the trail. I was wet and miserable for a few miles and stopped in first shelter to make coffee and warm up. The temp was dropping towards freezing so I knew I had to get moving again. As I continued hiking up in the sleet it turned to snow as I crested Lake Mtn. You gotta be shittin' me. It's May 6th and snowing. All my gear is wet and I am hating this nonsense. Thankfully it stopped and got sunny as I came down the other side to Laurel Creek shelter. I put up my tent hastily, made a huge dinner, and crawled into bed at 7:15. It started raining moments later and I had forgotten to stake the sides of my tent as water dropped down and under the floor. Dang it! I ran back out and staked it up but it is going to be a cold wet night. My feet hurt, the weather is dog crap, and I don't want to walk anymore.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563723,"Of course it rained hard last night...BUT I got a great nights sleep. I got up and hung my tenting to dry, made breakfast, and was last one out of camp. The sun was up, all my stuff was dry, and within a mile or so I found myself in Virginia pasture land on a glorious morning. A few miles though the pastures brought me to the largest Oak tree on the AT, the Keffer Oak. Old growth trees stir my soul and it didn't disappoint. From there I had a tough climb to the ridge line trail and it was spectacular. For miles and miles I had a 20 mile view up and across the valley. I sat and looked out while eating lunch and could feel all the negativity of the last few days leave me. After 12 miles, the trail dropped into the valley and headed up Brush Mtn on the other side to the Audie Murphy Memorial. Though it was a few tough miles of elevation, it was one of the coolest things I've seen out here. At the spot where his plane crashed in 1971 they've erected a memorial to the most decorated American hero. People have left all sorts of medals, dog tags, etc around it. I was there with Renegade, a 30 yr career military man, and it was moving to hear him discuss Audie Murphy and his legacy in the military both here and in Europe. After some reflection we hiked back down into the valley and camped. It was a damn fine, albeit long, day on the AT. Songs: Dire Straits - Waterline (smooth smooth smooth)Steely Dan - The Boston Rag (Good rythm as I made the climb to the memorial)Brian Ferry & Rocy Music- Dance Away (the castanets in this song are ridiculous.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563726,"Renegade and I woke up to a cold wind at the Pickle Branch shelter. The sort of chilly wind that portends clear skies but perhaps a light jacket if the wind blows. Fantastic! I could've slept in but the AWOL guidebook promised treats I have been waiting years to see so we got moving and packed up fast. The first 3 1/2 miles were tough but I came to ""The Ledges"" on my left and my pace quickened. ""The Ledges"" are a series of rocky tableaux that afford excellent long range views up the valley to the west. They are also the gateway to the ""Dragon's Tooth"", a rocky spire thrust from the top of the mountain. (Geek note* Actually the rock formation is the result of geologic folding and so the rocks are perpendicular. You can see it in my pictures) ""The Tooth"" beckoned me to climb it and the panorama from the top was breathtaking. It was also pretty darn scary. I took a few pictures, a quick video, and got the queasy feeling in my stomach when I looked down. (It took all limbs, and no pack, to go up and down here. Wouldn't be possible on a wet day) The Dragon's tooth also marks the 700 mile mark on the Appalachian Trail so I was feeling pretty good despite the dizzying heights. But more good things beckoned so it was time to keep walking. Carefully descending the rocks, I began to drop down into the rhododendron forest in full bloom below. After countless miles of hiking through rhododendrons, I was finally seeing them in their full spring glory. Thousands of pink blossoms highlighted the trail down into the valley. It was glorious. After about 5 miles,  I ran into Bulletproof and Chopsticks and we continued on together to the next big climb. 
Now this was no ordinary climb--it was the climb that all northbound thru hikers yearn to make. The hike up McAfee Knob. Perhaps the most iconic photo spot on the Appalachian trail, McAfee's Knob provides the most scenic view in Virginia and a chance to step out on a precipice to take it all in. Having seen the photos countless times in books and magazines it was hard to believe it was just ahead. To sweeten the pot, we ran into trail magic on the way up. A wonderful young couple gave us Budweiser and snickers. I offered multiple thank you's, downed four snickers bars, and stuffed the beer in my pack to enjoy at the summit. (Enough foreshadowing: That beer was delicious)
The picture above just doesn't do the place justice. The others I hiked up with hung out a little while and then headed out to do more miles (7 more to Tinker Cliffs) but I sat up there for more than an hour letting the magnitude of the sweeping panorama wash over me. It is hard not to feel childlike awe for God's creation in a place like this. {On the note, today's song was 'This must be the place' by Talking Heads} Eventually I headed down about half a mile and camped by Campbell Shelter. Tomorrow I'll do Tinker Cliffs (they look back at McAfee Knob from miles away) as any more majesty today would make me think I'd died and gone to heaven. (Though surely ones feet don't hurt like this in heaven)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563891,"After yesterday's highlight reel of the AT in Virginia it wasn't difficult to get motivated this morning. Positivity was back on the menu! 
I headed out about 7:30am (after walking about 1/10th of a mile to see sunrise in clearing. Good stuff) and knew I needed to lay down some early miles today to get to Daleville before the forecasted afternoon rain. On the ridge walk I had Cell service (wonders never cease) and called the HoJo to book a room. They are Hiker friendly, close to trail, free breakfast & wifi, and have laundry facility. Perfect. (hadn't stayed at a Howard Johnsons in decades and it is great!)
Soon I arrived at Tinker Cliffs. Holy Mackarel! And here I thought yesterday was magnificent. The view back to McAfee Knob was tremendous. CBiscuit and I were hiking this section together and we both kept stepping out onto another overlook gasping and taking videos. I took several but it's a fools game trying to capture grandeur in a little  4"" screen. In the words of Forrest Gump, ""I couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the earth began..."" Even now I look at the pictures and they pale against my memory of it. Our opportunity to experience this world is an amazing gift. (Or as the young people say, #kickassview#AT#yolo) The AT follows the Cliffs for a mile or so and then begins its descent along the northern ridge of Carvin Cove reservoir.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563980,"Woke up in a comfy bed at the HoJo in Daleville. I planned to take full advantage of the free breakfast this morning and then start hiking but the forecast called for rain (of course its been sunny all day) and my knees begged me to take a rest. Four of the hikers I had breakfast with were taking a zero day so I capitulated and took the day off. (Cotton, Craig, Bulletproof, Chopsticks, Cbiscuit, McGyver, poGo, etc were headed on so we said our farewells n happy trails)
First stop was the lobby hiker box (place other hikers put stuff they don't want to carry) and I scored some Aleve, towelettes, and 6 snickers & cliff bars. (Who throws those in a hiker box? Excellent Groundscore!) Also grabbed a backwash syringe to use for cleaning out my water filtration system though I returned it when done. (These things are in every hiker box) Went back to the room, cleaned H2O filter, added my 'groundscore goodies' to food bag, and made a resupply list. Having done laundry last night it was time to shop. 
First, I walked up to the Outfitter and got a new pair of socks. (I carry three pairs in rotation with an extra pair of 'vampire socks' hidden in the bottom of my pack just in case. These do not see the light of day except in emergencies) Next door was the liquor store. How convenient! So I got two airplane bottles of Early Times for happy hour today. Such a luxury, no one carries alcohol on the trail due to the weight,  so this is a nice treat of civilization. (The ice in my drink even more so) Skipped the Chinese restaurant and went in to the Krogers. Picked up a few items for resupply and a few luxuries for the day. (Best luxury item you ask? Black Cherry Chobani Yogurt. It is my craving! Can't pack it out so I eat 4-5 each day I'm in town.) Left the grocery to go back to HoJo but had to stop for lunch at the Wendy's situated in the parking lot. Yeah, yeah it's garbage fast food. [#whatever] It is also the kind of thing you crave after spending day and night in the woods for months on end. Dipping those French fries in that Frosty is all kinds of heavenly ...and the kind of thing you remember when you are in a wet tent eating your Ramen. 
The rest of the afternoon is spent reading, researching trip/calendar logistics, going through gear and ""tightening up"" your systems. Dinner will be more glorious civilized garbage. 
No music today-- just the sounds of trucks, traffic, and industry. (It is astounding how loud {and fast} everything is in the city. It's a sonic and visual assault. As if I've spent days listening to a quiet symphony and then -bang- on comes Motörhead at full volume. Nothing wrong with it, just a bit shocking.)
So that's how things go on a HoJoZeRo. While that may seem boring it is actually really cool. I got a chance to meet and chat with David at the liquor store and it was so pleasant. Same with the two old men, Charles and Quinton, at the Wendy's sitting next to me. Even the funny conversation at the convenience store with the redneck driving a beat-to-hell yellow (&rust) 1975 Ford LTD had me grinning from ear to ear. It ain't just about walking the miles. It's all about the smiles. HoJoZeRo is full of smiles.

I had a restless night as my legs kept cramping up and then, before the sun rose, it sounded like an entire army was trying to pack up for about 45 minutes. I let all of the noisy people get their stuff done and get out before moving. Not to mention with the rain coming down there was no compelling desire to get out there. I hit the trail and started doing miles in a light drizzle. Yuck...soggy going all day. ""Rain, rain go away!"" Not the way I wanted to spend my two month anniversary on the trail...
By lunchtime I reached Jennings Creek Bridge which is a swimming hole when it's a nice day but it was not a swimming hole today. Had on gloves, hat, rain jacket and it was pouring rain. I did, however, climb down the embankment under the bridge to get out of the rain and eat my lunch. Sitting there like a hobo troll, using my knife to scoop peanut butter out of the jar, I watched a flyfisherman across the stream pull a trout out of the river. Very cool! 
After lunch I continued on in the rain... but not too far as I came to the 'Taj Mahal' of shelters: the Bryant Ridge shelter.  Though I had only done about 13 miles and it was still 2:30 in the afternoon, I figured I wasn't going to find a better place. Called it a day and thoroughly enjoyed spending the afternoon eating multiple hot meals on the large porch. A few friends stopped by too. They looked ready to throw in the towel and it wasn't hard to convince them to stay. Eventually there would be eight of us sleeping in a shelter built for more than 20. Quite a fun evening as we all sat watching it pour rain and laughing and joking about our short day. Hopefully the Sun will come out tomorrow and we can make up the miles.

Called and arranged a ride back to the trailhead from a local ATC maintainer Ken Hawkins (trailname: Mushroom).  We met at The Amish Cupboard at 10:30am after I had done some last minute shopping for treats (hard salami and cheese, chocolate raspberries, cappuccino mix, hard candies, etc) and he spirited me across the Blue Ridge Pkwy to the Long Mountain wayside. I thanked him and then sat at the picnic table sorting my pack to accommodate the result my shopping venture. Finally about 11:30am I headed north. The first four miles, as usual, were straight up hill. I underestimated their difficulty and sat for about 30 minutes once I hit the final summit. Forrest passed me. Then Peach & Burning Man too.  I got back in the saddle and was blessed with a great hike over grassy balds for the next few miles and then relatively gentle rolling pathways for the rest. I pulled into the Seeley-Woodworth Memorial shelter and it was empty. Cheesehead, Thirty, and Forrest all stayed here but set up their tents. I figured if they build a little wooden house out here all for me I'll use it! So, for the second time in three days, I have a shelter all to myself.  Cool!
We all cooked dinner at the picnic table and chatted until hiker midnight (sundown - 8:30pm) then went to bed. 
The shorter miles today will be repeated for the foreseeable future. I was so sore after the last few days that even a motel stay couldn't fix it.

In the 1st mile out of camp I was passed by fast young man and decided I was not keeping up. 2 miles later found him sitting looking at the guide book. He asked, ""where you going?"" When he heard Maupin, he interjected with, ""you should go to the brewery!"" I was not aware of any brewery but I was certainly intrigued. About 2 miles past the Maupin shelter you hit VA664 and, 5 miles east on that road, lies The Devils Backbone Brewery & Basecamp. Looked like a longer day was going to happen.

Late in the day we went past an old graveyard (1866) and then ran into an older gentleman who was clearing a fallen tree from the path. We stopped to talk and found out the cemetery is the resting place of his great grandparents and kin. We walked about half a mile and came to some ruins- an old chimney and stone foundation. While we were stopped taking it in, the old gentleman came back down the trail and we discovered his mom was born there in 1910!  Fitzgerald is 77 and he ended up hiking the last few miles with us, regaling us with local history, and then drove us all 4 miles to town. One of the best afternoon's I've had on the trail. Of all the days to pass through that section, we got to meet and learn more about it then most. Quite a blessing. 
We celebrated at the Ming Gardens AYCE buffet then hit the local YMCA for a shower. Now I am tenting in the local park with about 12-15 other Thru hikers.

From here we got our back country permits and headed into Shenandoah National Park. A long day with a lot of elevation gain. (Always the case leaving towns) It was actually a tough day as it was very hot (in the 90's), almost no views, no wildlife, and only one water source in the first 20 miles. Aarrghh! I did enjoy Mountain Laurel in bloom profusely but it really was just a slog of a day. Sometimes you just gotta push the miles. Bulletproof, InFlux, and I hiked together most of the day and it was fun passing the time learning about each other's favorite things (meals, vacations, painters, colors, quotes, etc). Camped in a rocky patch but had a good meal and look forward to a better day tomorrow. Life is Amazing.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565434,"Woke up in the rocky tent site and packed it up quick. Convinced my self to be 'super positive' today then hit the trail knowing that a 'wayside' sat 9 miles north on the trail (and that yummy treats awaited). We steamrolled through those first nine miles to the wayside and then spent an hour and a half sitting and eating. (Enjoyed both a full breakfast and a delicious lunch while there). The afternoon miles came harder but eventually fell away as the afternoon progressed. Passed the 900 mile mark then pulled over to camp about 90 minutes later. 
While most of the day was spent hiking in and out of the clouds, it was a dry day and the wispy cover provided relief versus yesterday's scorching sun. I enjoyed the clouds but that (and the chance to get food) is about all I can say I've enjoyed about the Shenandoah National Park. While the terrain has been relatively easy & the elevation not too particularly hard, it is not a fun park to walk through. SNP is a park that is designed to be driven through. It is for cars--not for hikers. The only views are for cars, the forest feels devoid of wildlife (and I've seen very few animals of any kind), and you always hear the sound of motor vehicles. I had great expectations for the SNP but it has been a bit of a let down. {Actually I've walked 400 miles of Virginia that was better!}
On the flip side, the company I've hiked and camped with has been fantastic! The trail crowd has thinned significantly as people have dropped out, some have taken breaks, and this weekend many folks went back south to Damascus,VA for ""Trail Days"" (a festival/trade show/reunion for Thru hikers). After 900 miles, the folks left are not only pretty serious about this endeavor but also ""aged"" by it. Like the casking and aging of spirits, the trail has altered their perceptions and the various flavors of the experience are interesting to behold. Looking forward to seeing the impact of another 900 miles!

Packed up in the rain and most everyone had already left by the time I got on the trail. Hate carrying wet gear but that's life. (Wet=heavy)
I had a pretty good pace going early and the trail just 'felt' better today. I was able to post yesterday's journal when I got to the road crossing about 3 miles in. PomPom caught up to me there and we hiked the next few miles. 
At a bend in the trail we came across a big turkey that 'followed' us. Obviously this hen was protecting a nest in the woods there. She kept clucking at us but it was cool to be so close (8-10 ft). {I think Pom might be an 'animal magnet' as later in the afternoon, a large bear just walked along paralleling the trail (20 yds out maybe) as well. In the evening leaving the Tap Room, five deer followed us too. Guess all the wildlife had been waiting on us to get farther north!}
I also had a chance to hike some with a section hiker, Journey, that we met yesterday. She is originally from Alpharetta (now working in Baltimore) and was out doing the southern Shenandoah section for the weekend. Cool to meet a 'home girl' and she was crushing big miles keeping up with us.  
Dinner/Happy hour found me at the Big Meadows Tap Room with InFlux, PomPom, Deep Cheeks, and Blue Steel. Terrific local brews, yummy pizza, a Lounge singer, and the coolest singin/dancin/laughin waitress you'd ever hope to meet, Debbie. Folks at other tables bought us rounds of drinks too and we had a great time. My SNP experience certainly took a turn for the better today. Ultimately we decided to do 3.5 miles to the Rock Spring [next] shelter, rather than pay at the campground, so we danced & laughed our way down the trail in the dark to the shelter and rolled in as the fire was dying (minutes before the rains came) and folks were heading to bed. 
Glad to land a shelter spot and fell asleep in no time.

(I had 7 pancakes, 8 sausage links, 10 pieces of bacon, two large helpings of eggs, two giant helpings of amazing grits, a bowl of fruit, a bowl of cereal, juice and repeated mugs of coffee. Not sure how I've lost 17 lbs!)
We sat around for about 1/2 hour enjoying one of the best views in the park (out of the dining room) finishing coffee and digesting before tackling Little Stoney Man Cliffs, The Pinnacle, and Mary's Rock. The first one is where they reintroduced the Peregrine Falcon to SNP. Very cool cliff sides and best views yet in the park. The Pinnacle was pretty easy and Mary's Rocks had terrific views with clouds below us. Eventually we worked back to lower elevation and put in pretty good miles today. Influx, BlueSteel and I are stealth camped on a ridge tonight outside Elk Wallows Gap. Only 17 miles left to hike here.

The threat of rain never materialized during the hike and it was so pleasant that I took a 1/2 mile side trail off the AT to the Fort Windham rock formation before hiking on to the hostel. Pretty cool basaltic columns (think ""Houses of the Holy"" album cover) and some bouldering over 40 ft high. After a little exploring, I took the Dickey Trail back to the AT and kept on trucking to the Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel. What a delightfully chill place! Came in, signed up, took a HOT shower, did some laundry, cooked & ate a pizza, and then got a free shuttle ride with others here  (Influx, Blue Steel, and El Vago) into Front Royal, VA where we hit Mexican food and grocery.
Side Note: El Vago had to go mail some things and resupply hard as his tent was torn up by a bear last night next to the shelter. Crazy! (Two people had their tents ripped open as they slept last night at that shelter area and the forest service has to shut down that shelter now. That's why you hang everything including your toothpaste.)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565845,"It's a zero day at Terrapin Station...so it's ""Mailbag Wednesday"" here at DLLsTrail Journal.
Our first letter comes from fearless reader Chaz, who hopes to NOBO in 2018: ""what do you buy when you go to Grocery to resupply?""
Great question Chaz! Food is a hot topic on the AT. When I hit town for resupply it goes like this:
1) Dinners-buy some combination of: a couple Ramens, a couple pasta/rice sides, and maybe a instant potatoes as my 3-4 dinners. 
2) Breakfast-buy some combo of: pop tarts, breakfast bars, honey buns. I used to eat Oatmeal every day but now only 2-3 times a week. I can usually find a few oatmeals in a hiker box. 
3)Lunch- this is toughest. I carry various 'bars' (power, granola, Luna, Larabar, Clif, Kind, etc) which are eaten all day. I carry a jar of P-nut Butter and a block of hard cheese always. Easy tasty calories. Salami most of the time too. All of these serve as ""lunch"". 
Paul asked, ""What's the worst or what do you dislike the most?""
Oh man, there are so many obvious things that suck. Even here in the real world (we call civilization the 'synthetic' or 'fake' world), it ain't all a vacation.  Packing and carrying a wet tent is a downer. R & R sucks (that's roots n rocks) for the feet. Sweating for five days without showering is straight up stinky. I'd say 'the worst' is fighting the mental game. There isn't just 'one thing' so much as tackling a tough day full of little obstacles (like the aforementioned) while carrying a reloaded heavy pack uphill leaving town with bad weather. Fighting doubt  in those moments is a tough mental game. 
Jonathan asked about ""mail drops"". I have only had a couple. It is easier to shop in town and trying to tell people simply 'where I'm going to be next week' is harder than you'd think. 
""Dude, what is the 'hiker box'?""
Ha! So, Dude, in establishments all along the AT (hotels, hostels, church's, town shelters, etc) there are boxes that folks put things in they don't want to carry. 'One mans trash is another's treasure' and we know someone might need it. Just this morning I pulled out a Emergen-C vitamin packet and two instant coffees. I put 8ozs of Olive Oil back in it, too. Always check the hiker box!
And finally I've gotten this one a few times, ""What do you do if it rains?""
Well, today I sit watching it rain out the window and relish being warm n dry inside. (It's stellar when a town or hostel stay can coordinate with Mother Natures watering schedule.) Most of the time you just 'embrace the suck'; put on your pack cover, rain gear, and keep slogging. When it is thunder and lightning, I look to get to shelters.

Picked up our tickets, went and set up in the campground at our saved spots, and got introduced to the various denizens of this camp. Many of these families I am with have been coming to DelFest and camping together for better part of the last decade. Loads of smiles!

Had breakfast and said goodbye to my buddies in Front Royal, Virginia this morning and then got a shuttle back to the trailhead. Despite whittling away some items from my pack over the weekend, I started with the heaviest load to date given a hefty resupply. (currently carrying enough food to finish Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, and get in to Pennsylvania!) The 'festival rains' had made their way east apparently and the trail was quite muddy. Despite the slop, it was nice to be ""back in the saddle"" and the miles rolled by pretty easily. In the first 3 miles back on the AT, I had two bear encounters. Thankfully they both took off running (btw, bears are fast)!
At the first shelter, a quick look at the logbook confirmed that most of the folks I've been hiking with are far ahead. A few miles later I ran into Rocket and we discussed how the trail has 'thinned out' (Even his brother had to jump off the trail for medical reasons though Turtle hopes to be back in a month or so) and Trail magic has dissipated as we moved north. I moved on thinking about how different the trail has become and a few miles later--bang-- trail magic!
Mac and Pace, AT Thru hikers from 2015, were out with her mom (Mil) celebrating Mil's birthday by doing super trail magic. A Cheeseburger with grilled pineapple? Oh yeah. Grilled Veggies? Double yeah. Cold soda and beer? Triple yeah. 
They had watermelon slices, homemade brownies, chocolate bars, even a massage chair set up. It was awesome! Ended up sitting for over an hour chatting after eating copious amounts of treats. Cheers folks-Thanks for making my day! 
Ended up doing more miles than I had planned thanks to the refueling. Even had a beer at the shelter when I finished hiking compliments of those trail angels. Tomorrow I plan to hit the 1,000 mile marker. Hard to believe. I've hiked some long trips and great trails in my life but nothing like 1,000 miles of AT. So very thankful for the opportunity.

It was very muddy travel and the high grass wetted out my shoes in 34 minutes. (Yep, I looked at my watch) I was muttering and frustrated with water filled shoes for a bit but ultimately the scenery brought me around. Walking through the same misty forest that revolutionary and civil war soldiers walked through made wet shoe complaints seem silly. 
By late morning the fog lifted and clouds began to break. Just in time as I began the 14 mile section of AT known as ""The Rollercoaster"". A series of steep ascents and descents (with no views) comprised of very slick rocks -and all this mud- made for slow going today. Throw in some poisonous snakes and I did a long, slow 18 miles that felt more like 25. However, I did sit clean & dry out the feet as well as put on dry socks (despite soaked shoes) after the first hill and my feet were exceedingly glad. 
But the best part of the day was hitting the one THOUSAND mile mark. It was an emotional moment for me and I sat in the dirt on the mountainside for a few minutes just overwhelmed. Come so far. SO far. It's difficult to put in words the scope of it personally.

Finally headed to the trail about 8:00am and the first song out of the iPod this morning was 'Simple Man' by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Now there are two kinds of people in this world. Those that think Skynyrd is great and those that are wrong. And I'm not wrong. The song strikes at the core of why I am hiking and got me to thinking about recent events in my life as well as a letter I read earlier from Father Konzen. (I promise this is going somewhere and today's missive is an attempt to blend all of this and thank you) 
Many people; friends, family, and strangers have congratulated me on my AT thru-hike. The support is fantastic and more impactful than I can express. It's as if my actions are heroic but, truth be told, they aren't. I'm walking. Just trying to accept the 'real' me that I can (in the words of Skynyrd) ""love and understand"".
“Not everyone can be a hero.  Some of us sit on the curb and clap as the hero goes by.” -Will Rogers
Father Konzen wrote, ""It’s great to have a moment in the limelight, but it’s also great to acknowledge others as they have their moment, regardless of whether we ever have those moments ourselves."" 
He went on to note that it is...""the spirit of humility that urges us to celebrate the accomplishments of others and to be less concerned about our own recognition."" 
Ain't that the truth! The real heroes are those people working hard each day. The ones teaching, feeding, caring for,  and helping people. The folks like YOU who do the work you have been given without thought of recognition. So I applaud you, my dear readers. Not only for the work you do but the humility of spirit to support and cheer for me on this insane journey. Thank You for all you do. 
As for my walk today: entered my fifth state today, West Virginia (yes, finally got out of Virginia), and stopped by the ATC Headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV to log in. This is the unofficial/psychological halfway point for Thru-hikers. Really cool to see the HQ, as I have been an ATC member for 25 years. They took my picture and put me in the logbook. (#484)
Afterwards, I headed in to the historic district (Harpers Ferry was a civil war 'lynch pin' city and site of John Browns attempted rebellion) and got a bunk at the Towns Inn Hostel (circa 1840). Tomorrow I'll hike to Maryland and notch state #6 if these old knees will cooperate.

An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!” 
Like most Hiker journals, I have quoted Thoreau previously. Given yesterday's note on being a 'simple man' this one seemed like an apropos place to start today. And though out on a simple journey purposely living a very basic existence most days, I want to 'split hairs' & contradict Mr Thoreau on this one somewhat. Details matter. While I agree that simplicity is generally best, in some instances the details make all the difference. 
Writing needs some detail. The best writers can make a story come to life with a dash of detail. My struggle to write these journals is finding a way to convey the grandness I see & feel in the little things, though on the surface they appear mundane.

Sat drinking coffee on the porch of the Towns Inn in Harpers Ferry looking out over old pre-civil war row houses to the sun rising over the Potomac. No rush for the trail today. The narrow cobblestone streets. The quaint porches and stairwells. Ghosts of early America beckoned me to take time and stroll the historic district. On one side of the street was the spot Meriweather Lewis embarked from with the corp of Discovery. Less than 100 feet away was the site of John Browns rebellion and the start of the Civil War. Stonewall Jackson had captured this city on his way to join General Lee at Antietam. He took 12,000 Union prisoners...
By early afternoon, the fanciful historian gave way to the pragmatic walker. I threw on the backpack, bought an ice cream cone (single scoop coconut in a sugar cone-Devil is in the details, eh?), and walked across the Potomac river via the C&O railroad towpath into Maryland.

Ascended up out of the river basin toward South Mountain. For the next few days I will be following the 'Civil War site' trail. Every few miles I come to a battlefield.

The campground is right in the AT and has hot showers, bathrooms, etc....Holy Mackarel, it felt great! I got cleaned up, washed my clothes, filled up my H2O, and had some breakfast. (Sassafras, McGyver, Hoosier, and Volunteer all stopped too.) 
Headed up the trail an hour later feeling great and came to Washington Monument. This was the first monument built to George in 1827.  It afforded excellent views of Antietam Natl Battlefield to the west and of Pennsylvania to the north. Ate lunch here before heading on up the ridge. Over the next few miles would go up to Annapolis Rocks and Black Rock Cliffs. Both offered excellent westward  views though it was very windy in the afternoon. 
Late in the day my spirits were sapped by rocks that rolled both my ankles. Painful travel had me down but, in the space of just minutes, a baby bear running from me to his mom (adorable and fast) and then my first-ever sighting of a scarlet tanager picked me up enough to push on to camp. Amazing how the trail can lift your spirits like that. 
At camp, Kurt and Lucky (2 Ohioans I met at Bears Den) had hotdogs and chips for me. Wow! Then McGyver showed up with Pizza and a coke for me. Double wow! 
Sometimes things just turn around. I was so down at 4:30 I wanted to quit. By 6:30 I was having a great time again. Guess that's why you gotta Keep Walking!","Crampton Gap Shelter/Tent pad

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567326,"Last night the camp got quite crowded in the evening and night hours. (Waking to a Scoutmaster hammering tent spikes into the rocky soil a few feet from me at 9:30pm was extremely uncool) Woke up early (yep...payback) and found myself on the trail at sunrise walking amidst chest high grass in a Maryland field. It appeared God had put Monet in charge of the clouds this morning and my pace was reduced to a stroll. Eventually stopped by a stream to make coffee and enjoy a last bit of magic, a juicy navel orange, that Lucky and Kurt gave me before we parted ways this morning. 
After breakfast, the elevation jumped with a climb over Raven Rocks and then hit some boulder fields as I approached PenMar park. Though the old historic hotel at PenMar is gone, it is a beautiful place. And I was able to ""yogi"" a free soda from some picnickers. (Pepsi, but beggars can't be choosers.)
After a brief stop there, I walked down the road to the Mason-Dixon line and crossed over into state #7: Pennsylvania. {fourth state in four days} Please note that from here on out I'll be traveling in Damn Yankee Land. Though I ""did some time in Jersey"" as a kid, hiking up north will be all new to me...should be awesome!
Rolled across a few miles of PA before stopping at a beautiful campsite that has everything from privy to Bear poles to tent pads. Even two shelters: one for snoring and one for non-snorers (well done Yankees, well done!) Lots of fun folks here too. Bad Santa, Luke, Jingle Butt, Gadget Girl, McGyver, Frosty, etc. All are excited to hit the halfway point and begin the legendary ""Rocksylvania"". It'll be interesting.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567445,"Inhaled 1200 calories worth of honey buns, drank a cup of coffee, & hit the trail at 7:30am. The first hill was a tough 1000 ft elevation gain in a short mile to Chimney Rocks but it flew by given purposeful steps. Not driven for the delightful morning view but rather a visit to Caledonia State Park. Lying ten miles to the north, this park opened its concession stand last weekend and the promise of grilled food was magnetic. All the hikers in camp had it on their radar.
The miles rolled by pretty easily despite an occasional boulder field and I found myself at Caledonia at 11:15. The burgers, fries, lemonade, and ice cream exceeded my expectations. Joined by McGyver, Trainwreck, Sunrise, Bad Santa, Luke and others, we sat in the shade and gorged ourselves. It was a nice break and I didn't hit the trail again until 1:15.  
Much slower this time as four scoops of ice cream thickened my blood. 
The afternoon hike was much like the morning and Pennsylvania had the 'white carpet' rolled out for me. I say the white carpet as profuse Mountain Laurel blooms, millions and millions of them, decorated the forest throughout the day. I've seen lots of Mountain Laurel but not like this. It was everywhere. Each little 'bottle cap' flower seemed to smile and the forest felt enchanted today. Incredible. 
Rolled in to the shelter about 5pm and was cooking dinner when the rain came. It was a fun shelter tonight full of laughs and I had my own bunk here. The PATC (Potomac AT Club) has the best shelters on the trail thus far. Kudos for making them right and keeping them clean. 
Tomorrow is a short day as I plan to stay at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel outside Pine Grove Furnace Park. (My clothes need washing -badly- and so does my body.)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567530,"A very short walking day but a pretty great rainy day on the Appalachian trail. 
Left the Birch Run shelter about 7:45 in the morning and hit the official halfway point in less than an hour at Dead Woman's Hollow Rd (mile 1094.9 this year) It's a shorter journey to keep going north now versus turning around and walking home! 
A few hours later we rolled into Pine Grove Furnace State Park (just before the clock struck noon and the skies opened up). The general store here is the home of the half gallon challenge. What's that you ask? Well, that's where crazy hikers try to eat a half gallon of ice cream as quick as they can to commemorate being halfway through the trail. Now that's a normal tub (1.5 quarts) plus another pint. And a human body really isn't designed to digest that much cream but... ""we all scream for ice cream"". I had raspberry and peach. Delicious. 
We sat on the porch for the next five hours as hikers arrived to try and win their prize: a little wooden spoon. More than a dozen of us sat laughing, aching, and eating. (Only Highlander threw up) Many, including myself, had reservations at the giant old Ironmasters Mansion Hostel next door (which didn't open until 5pm) so it was a wonderful afternoon without packs on and no place to go. We did enjoy the AT Museum which is located here as well. Amazing to see all the early gear as well as historical planning, design, building, and changes to the trail over time. 
Eventually we climbed the hill to the mansion, checked in, hit the showers, and started washing clothes. Soap & hot water is a wonderful mix. Pizza for dinner and round table discussions. Breakfast will be served at 6:30am and then big miles. Tomorrow we make for the town of Boiling Springs, PA. {Less miles to Katahdin than I've already done--woot-woot!}

Kudos to the mansion for a fine bed, a great breakfast, and a wonderful way to start my day. We cruised right out of Pine Grove Furnace state park and tracked on into the hills of Pennsylvania. Relatively benign trail allowed for easy walking and not too much knee pain for most of the day (with the exception of fall#6 on the AT while going over a boulder maze).   After cresting Center Point Knob, we rolled down into the pastures outside of Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania. 
One of the great things about being ""lost in America"", and seeing the country at 2 1/2 mph, is the opportunity to to be surprised by the little things. Things like getting out of the rain via an overpass or, as I did today, walking through waist/chest high fields of grain. I've never in my life, until now, been surrounded by 'amber waves of grain'. While I suppose there's nothing extraordinary about a field of grain or standing in the wind, this particular moment, under a brilliant blue sky dotted with puffy clouds just stirred my soul. It was like being dipped in the very marrow of life and I will never forget it. 
 The trail left the pastures and wound around Furnace Lake in downtown Boiling Springs before ultimately winding up at the Boiling Springs Tavern. A few locally crafted pints at a 185-year-old Pub is a nice way to conclude a fine day of walking.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567910,"What does $15 get you? In the AT hiker support system of hostels, fifteen bucks can get you quite a lot. A delightful hostel owner named Lisa came and picked us up at the tavern yesterday & took us back to her farm. We met the horses, chickens, dogs, etc and found the bunkhouse. $15 not only put a roof over our heads for the night's forecasted rain, but also got us a hot shower and all the grilled cheese & hotdogs we could eat. Quite the bargain. But do you know what else $15 gets you at the Farm Hostel ? A little red rooster who ain't too lazy to crow up a day. We all woke up and, with no shuttle until 7:30am, ten of us spent three hours fiddling around grumpily in the bunkhouse while it poured rain and the rooster crowed. When we got to the trailhead it was still raining so I enjoyed a big breakfast at the café and visited the outfitter until the radar showed clearing. I set out across the pastoral Cumberland Valley in a light drizzle. The fields were shrouded in mist for 7 to 8 miles and was mostly barley and rapeseed. I had never seen Rapeseed but it is an interesting plant cultivated for cooking oil. 
From the fields, the trail moved down along the Susquehanna River. Kingfishers called up and down the river and, for a few miles, it was just like walking along the Chattahoochie river back home. However, the deer tracks in the path were in a mottled khaki mud rather than Georgia red clay and kept me grounded in the present.
Eventually the AT moved out of the valley and climbed the ridge. Hiking amongst the rocks of PA I wore down and stopped a few miles short of Duncannon. The shelter was large and since there were only four of us we stayed inside.

I hitched a ride from a very nice man at the liquor store (Thanks again Joe. Appreciate you going right back to the store you just left) up to the grocery and loaded up on resupply. As usual, I bought more than I should but the allure of food in town is simply overwhelming. 
From there I walked into town and stopped for lunch and a beer at the iconic Doyle. This hotel and bar is legendary on the AT. It is also an absolute shithole. But in a good way.(Shout out to 'Governor Sanford'. Enjoyed meeting you at The Doyle and happy trails! That Trail name is hilarious...still chuckling) My beer & burger hit the spot and we headed out of town about one o'clock. 
Climbed the mountain out of town and hiked about 11 miles to the shelter. Warm and sunny with great vistas of the Cumberland Valley. It was a no-brainer to stop at the shelter as there isn't much water on the ridge line trail.

Did 18 miles hiking through beautiful woodlands. Hustled up a few deer and got my wits scared out of me by a snake but otherwise uneventful. Even the knee that has been bothering me felt decent this afternoon. Made camp early today by a rushing creek and had time for two dinners. Tonight's menu you ask?

Big climb out of the valley and the rain seemed to be gone so I took off my rain gear as it gets sweaty* fast. I was dancing along digging some disco but, no sooner than More Than A Woman > Jive Talkin (BeeGees) was over, a rain storm bust loose. I hauled into to Swartara State Park and threw on my rain gear ...but not before I was really wet. Aarrghh. 
Thankfully the sun followed & I stopped to dry things and each lunch. Hit some tough rocky stretches today. (Everyone I was with fell at least once today but I managed to stay upright all day.) Boulder fields are difficult but the long legs certainly help. Didn't do a ton of miles today but felt good and tired when I arrived at the '501 Shelter' and decided to stay. Not to mention, the '501' is a bit of a legend. 
Truly this shelter is a cut above. First, it has a live in caretaker in the house next to it. It has a giant octagonal skylight in the center and is really a cabin as it has four walls. There are bunks for 12 people, and there is a SHOWER. It's cold but it works-- so I'm clean and happy. Oh yeah, it's close to Hwy 501 [hence the name] so pizza delivers here! We had 4 large pizzas and got cold sodas. It was a terrific treat. 
Tomorrow will be a short day as I plan to stop at the Rock-n-Soul Hostel outside Port Clinton. Have heard good things about it and need to do laundry & resupply. It's a little reward for going past 1,189.8 mile marker today which means there are less than a thousand miles to Mt. Katahdin. Nice.

While the 501 Shelter is pretty awesome (and the caretaker, Borderline, is an excellent host), I did not sleep very well last night. Perhaps it was pizza and soda. Perhaps some knee pain. Probably both, but it had me tossing and turning all the same.  
Got up early, made coffee, packed up and was down the trail just after 6:30. 
It was a relatively easy day from an elevation standpoint and the terrain was marginal [given PA rocks] so the miles went by pretty quickly. Before I knew it we had crossed mile marker 1,200! When we reached the French & Indian War monument we called Craig at Rock-n-Sole Hostel and he was waiting for us at the road when we emerged from the wood. By 10:30am, we had bunks and I was hitting the outdoor shower. The HOT water shower. Wow. (Note: If there is one thing I've learned on the this journey, i will never take a shower for granted again.)
Then I emptied my pack of everything and washed the pack. We got laundry done and washed everything, even all the stuff stacks. The stench has been held at bay for the time being. I got rid of a few items in the hiker box and recharged the electronics. 
This afternoon we went to the Schyulkill Mtn Brewery and got growlers for the evening. Really cool experience and... Delicious! 
The hostel is full as a dozen of us are here. Several of the 'regular crew' and a few newbies. Really cool to meet Clunk, young man from the U.K. and we talked a good bit this afternoon. It is always interesting getting the perspective of someone from another country.  
Dinner was off the charts. One of the finest meals I've had in months. {Pulled pork, scalloped potatoes with onion straws, green beans, & coleslaw.} Crawled back to the bunk house fighting off a food coma and am laying around blissfully typing up today's journal.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568412,"Today is my three month anniversary on the trail and celebrated by going to the oldest brewery in America located down the road in Pottsville, PA. Yes, the Yuengling Brewery Tour was this morning's ""mileage"". Really cool place and full of history in a town that is also full of interesting history (home of the Molly Maguires). We had a chance to try a few beers before heading to Roma's Pizza for lunch and then rolling back to the trail head. 
Craig, the owner of Rock n Sole Hostel, picked us up in Pottsville and took us back to the trail head about 1:30pm. He had already delivered our packs to the city pavilion in Port Clinton so we 'slack packed' about 15 miles. Man, that is the way to travel. Without a heavy pack the boulders seemed much easier to navigate and even dodging the timber rattlers was easier. (The big boy I saw today had 13 rattles and, when he fired them up just before I stepped on him, my whole body froze and flooded with adrenaline. That sound is effective!)
We rolled into Port Clinton about 6pm and stopped at the Fire Station and social club for a drink and some grub. Great folks! They let us sign in as guests despite it being members only club and we hung out for a few hours before walking through town to the pavilion where hikers can stay for free.  There are more than a dozen hikers here and it was cool to hear everyone talking about their experiences and seeing the social scene congeal again. Certainly the crowd has thinned a good bit over the last month but it's reassuring to see so many still chasing their dreams. After three months I am still surprised by the grandeur every day.

The conversation was deep yet rapid and we covered nine+ miles in no time. Love meeting interesting new folks out here!
We also got trail magic(!) from Nikkei, a 2016 thru hiker that brought cokes and brownies to the trail head, right by the Eckville Shelter. It was 1pm and the mercury had moved up over 90 sowe sat in the shade at the shelter to relax. Was able to dry my wet tent and charge my phone there too. We ended up hanging out for two hours as others (Yogi, Bear Slayer, Hush, Nemo, etc) came rolling in. It was fun just sitting in the shade, beating the heat,  and getting to know a new batch of folks. Loads of smiles. 
Finally headed out just after 3:00p with a goal to get to Allentown Shelter. This begins the fabled 'Rocksylvania' portion of PA...and it will continue for another 60 miles to New Jersey.

Along the way I ran into Tumbleweed (and met his sister Moxie) who I hadn't seen in over two months. We had hiked together back in Tennessee before he got off to go to Romania for a couple of weddings and I didn't think I'd ever see him again. We chatted a bit and they gave me trail magic: a pineapple! Now that is heavy,  and I considered saying no, but it was kinda small and Switchback & I ended up eating it at the shelter at 10am. What a treat!
More boulder fields in the coming miles slowed me down some but finally arrived at Shelter about 1:15.  I was torn between calling it an early day or going for big miles. I ""camel-d up"" and loaded my water at the 17 mile mark for the monster ahead... the Lehigh Gap.  The trail crosses the river and goes straight up on the other side. It is hand over foot rock climbing up 1,000 ft. 
The sun beat down but I took it real slow. The last portion was as scary as anything the AT has thrown at me.  Extreme caution was required because a fall up here would be brutal. (Perhaps life ending) I couldn't look down as my stomach was fluttering but it was over soon enough and I was on to the 'reward' for the climb. The reward? Why a long walk through the Palmerton Zinc Superfund site! Yep, it was a nice stroll thru Mordor. The smelting that took place from the 1800's until 1980 created a toxic zinc & lead wasteland. You can't drink the water here in the superfund site. (Have to carry a bunch to get through the next 20 miles and, yes, that made the mountain climb that much harder) But the views were great, the rocks were the rocks, and so ended up doing over 24 miles walking all afternoon.

Since I did not have an immediate need to get on the trail, preparations were slow as I sat and made coffee on the porch and talked with other hikers. My late arrival last night precluded talking with too many people so it was a good opportunity to catch up. Rain was in the forecast & my feet were aching so the slow start was fine. 
I hiked out about 8:30am and walked in to New Jersey in minutes. Yahoo! State #8 today. Within a few hours I would cross the 1,300 mile mark as well. The trail was still rocky but felt different. Went past several beautiful ponds today including historic Sunfish Pond. Was not able to see vistas (due to socked in clouds/fog) but the temp was pleasant and rain held off until I was at the AMC Mohican Center just over ten miles in. It feels good to dodge a rain storm and even better when you have food. Best of all, I had a box from home shipped there that contained some things I needed including NEW SHOES! Though I hated to put them on my dirty feet and wear them out into the wet woods, it was worth it. Throwing away the destroyed shoes felt good. Walking down the trail in new shoes felt glorious. 
I flushed grouse {way cool} twice on the afternoon walk and saw countless other critters. Went past Beaver homes in ponds, bullfrogs on lily pads, and wild flowers in the swamp. Managed to knock out 17 miles despite a late start and a couple hours of break at the AMC center.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569015,"I must start with a confession. Last night I did not get into my tent just to escape rain and bugs... I got into my tent because I was freaking out. Now I have camped alone many times but last night my imagination ran wild and my mind got 'tricksy'. Every noise conjured up a boogeyman & it felt like I was being hunted. I even sent my wife my global coordinates in case something happened to me. Yep, I freaked out. After more than three months out here, the big woods still have the power to leave me trembling in my tent. Just goes to show that walking over 2000 miles through the oldest mountains in the world may be physically demanding but the true challenge out here remains the mental aspect. 
(Last week a few of us were sitting around dinner talking about our scariest moments on the AT. Bears and snakes got their fair share of votes but not mine. Sure, I've had the crap scared out of me 'momentarily' by a big snake out here but the true moments of fear that occurred on the journey have been mental. My ""scariest moment"" came in a hot day under a blue sky in Maryland. I was exhausted. Aching knees, ankles that had been rolled repeatedly, sore hips and back--physically beaten. My spirit to go on had ebbed away as I struggled to walk over the rocks. My steps down to inches at a time, i surrendered to the the trail...sat down and choked back tears. I was finished and could not go on. My will was in tatters and my brain screamed 'uncle'. In the pit of my soul I was SCARED. I sent Jenny a text that I was done. She sent back that it would all be ok, to be careful, and that I could do it. My angel bride came through as usual and I'm still here... but notice was served. Mental strength is paramount.)
Needless to say, I did not sleep well until the morning light arrived. (slept well from 4-7am) Consequently, I was late out of camp today too.  Slick rocks and misty rain do not afford the opportunity for big miles. I fell on a boulder before stopping for lunch at shelter. {if you are keeping score at home, that is fall #7. Thankfully just a bruised butt} I did 3.5 more miles and came to Gyp's Tavern so I had 'second lunch'. Cheeseburger, tater tots, Stella Artois and ice cream sandwiches. Fantastic!
After that I hiked for miles past ponds, through the pines, up Sunrise Mtn and at the summit what should appear but a pavilion...full of musicians...and food. They took requests (John Denver please) and offered us the grace of their table. It was magical way to bring on the evening. We departed begrudgingly, but with smiles, as there were 3.4 miles remaining to finish the day at the Mashipacong Shelter.

I woke up late today. No problem. My plan was to do 5.5 miles and call it a day. I had reservations at Mosey's Place, a hostel down the road in NY, so I was in no hurry. Made coffee and took off about 8:45. At 10:30am Mosey picked me up in High Point State Park HQ and brought Action Jackson & I back to her house. Laundry being washed, tent dried and cleaned, shoes drying out...life is good. I didn't mean to take time off the trail right now but developed a bad blister on my heel (first one in over 1,000 miles) and the forecast calls for a LOT of rain in the next 36 hours -after hiking in sloppy wet for the last few days- so I went for the dry-out option.

Song of the Day: Gold Dust Woman by Fleetwood Mac. It kept me on my toes while trying not to slip and fall on the wet rocks this morning. StevieNicks just brings it.

I hadn't planned a zero day for another week but the weather forecast was dreadful so I decided to stay. Mosey fixed a big breakfast and the phone start ringing as hikers began seeking shelter. Glad I already had a bunk. 
Mosey gave me her Jeep to use so I drove 5 of us ran up to the Mexican restaurant for lunch then did a resupply at the grocery store. It was pouring buckets all day with tornado and flood warnings so it was fun sitting inside watching movies...& not hiking. The place filled up and by evening there were multiple hikers coming in for spots on the floor. Crazy.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569387,"Everyone got up early at the hostel this morning and they were itching to get back on the trail. Mosey made a giant breakfast and, after taking a quick shower(!), I devoured a bunch of eggs, bacon, pancakes, donuts & coffee. I was happy to be in the second wave of folks going back to High Point State Park HQ as it gave me a little extra prep time to tape my heel & knee. The trail was going to be soggy despite the beautiful weather.  
First few miles to the High Point monument came rather easy but, as feared, our shoes were full of water. However, the countryside was astounding and it was one of those days when I was constantly reaching for the camera. New Jersey really is beautiful and it was thrilling to be in her woods, bogs, swamps and townships. In the early to mid-1970's, I lived in New Jersey and walked to school through the power-line trails, played in the woods, climbed the trees, and have good memories of this place. Have been looking forward to spending a few days back here and it exceeded my rather lofty expectations today. 
The AT runs back and forth along the NJ/NY border here.  At lunch time I walked a mile off trail into Unionville, NY to stop at a general store/deli close by. Unionville was charming and upon arriving discovered a number of hikers were sitting on the front porch enjoying a break already. I grabbed a pastrami sandwich (and a few other treats) and joined them. Gave us all a chance to dry out wet socks and shoes in the sun as well. (The folks in town are very hiker friendly too - big thanks to Unionville for a great visit)
The afternoon trail went through wooded forests, around swollen ponds, traversed open pastures, behind suburban neighborhoods, and included miles of boardwalk thru wetlands. Both the Walkill Nature Preserve and the Powchuck Boardwalk {Wetlands trail} were part of today's hike. Extraordinary flora and excellent wildlife watching was on the docket. (Saw 'Reddy' fox sitting on an old stone wall in the pine forest today and he took off at my arrival. Watched him leap, dash off, and then trot out of sight. Funny, it made the blister pain subside too!)
After 20 miles, the last climb was up the ""Stairway to Heaven"". Though the climb was tough, the views back to High Point in the distance were terrific. It was really awesome to be able to see all the ground covered today as it stretched out across the horizon. After sitting a spell I hiked in to find water and stealth camped. Cooked, ate quick, then ducked in to my tent to escape the bugs. They are crazy today after all that rain. 
No songs today. Never put in the headphones as Nature provided all the soundtrack necessary.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569496,"Summer Solstice. The longest day of the year. On the trail it is also 'hike naked' Day.  
No, dear readers, have no fear as Daddy Longlegs wasn't cavorting nude across the New Jersey Wilderness. I didn't see any naked hikers either. What I did see was NJ in all her summer splendor. Perfect sky, light breeze, warm temps, and glorious sights. My first stop was at a Pond that looked as though it was made of crystal. I walked over a creek that was mesmerizing. Right down to the smallest grasses illuminated by perfectly placed shafts of sunlight. The dark water playing a lilting tune. As if from a dream...
Yes, New Jersey was putting on a show today. In the last mile (before climbing Prospect Rock and entering New York) while walking a boulder ridge, I came upon a big bear just below me. He didn't see me and I was downwind of him. I watched him forage a moment and even filmed him for a few seconds before revealing myself and watching him lope off. Well played, Jersey, well played. 
New York set about trying to 'Up the ante' immediately by offering distant views of NYC from its highest point on the AT. The trail traversed rocks most of the day and required some mountaineering at times. Rebar set in the rock aided climbs and, thankfully,the rock faces were dry and grippy. 
By afternoon, the trail rolled close enough to take a side trip to the Bellvale Creamery. Delicious ice cream and AC were the first order of business. Afterwards I sat trying to decide how much more my feet could take today when all of a sudden hikers started piling in. Naps, Solomon, Scout, Bulletproof, Scar, Milkman, Gavin, Emily, Action Jackson, Not Tonight, Mumbles all joined in and we took over one side of the shady pavilion outside. Ended up sticking around for over three hours. Great fun! We pulled off over a dozen ticks, bandaged up our feet, recharged our electronics, refilled our water bottles and ate a ton of ice cream. 
Eventually headed on down the trail a few miles to the first tent spot at Wildcat Shelter. Good food & good company here too. I think everyone is jazzed up to be in our ninth state!

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569602,"Spent last night in the Valley of the Mosquito. (Everyone cooked dinner wearing rain gear trying to keep from being eaten. Eventually we all sat in our tents talking to each other to avoid the bugs) Woke up and didn't even make coffee as doing so would have risked giving the little ******* a chance to drain all the blood from my body. Instead it was a race from camp hiking a few miles to Fitzgerald Falls and stopping there to have breakfast. Afterwards I continued on through the spectacular woods of upstate NY and entered Harriman State Park before lunch time. Tougher elevation and terrain than I was expecting but a super day of hiking. Got stuck trying to get through the ""lemon squeezer"" rock formation and had to take off my pack to get through but other than that it was just good hard hiking!
Mile 15 found me at Arden road andthat meant I was only about a half mile from the beach of Lake Tiorati so I headed down. Other hikers were there so we did what we always do: took over the place. Plugged in all our electronics to charge, stripped to underwear to go swimming, washed our clothes in the bathroom & laid all our stuff to dry in the sun. We ordered pizza to the beach and had 6 large pies devoured in no time. It was a great way to break up the day but eventually I had to haul out of there and do some fast miles before the sun went down. My goal was still 8 miles away, the old CCC shelter on West Mtn, but I knocked it out and watched nightfall overlooking the Hudson River with NYC illuminated on the horizon. A great end to a great day.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569715,"Woke to a beautiful day and decided to take my time this morning. Enjoyed coffee and the sunrise over NYC. Everyone got going but i didn't head out until 8am. It was a delightful ridge line walk half a mile back to the AT from the shelter and I decided during that stretch today would be slow. The terrain in NY has been a wake up call as the last few states had little elevation change. We are going up and down mountains again here in the Empire State. 
Went down West Mtn but had to tackle Bear Mtn next. Quite a haul to the Palisades monument on top and back down to the old Adirondacks style Inn on the other side. (On the way up crossed the 1,400 mile mark!) Bear Mountain State Park has been operating since 1915 and was very interesting. Ate at the Inn and then proceeded around the lake to the museum & zoo which the AT goes through. The lowest point on the trail is in front of the bear cage at 124 ft. above sea level. I've always enjoyed going to the zoo and the reptile house, the geology museum, and the raptors did not disappoint. Chose a good day to go slow!
From there I crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mtn Bridge (big suspension bridge) and began a steep climb back up into the mountains. It was 7 miles to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center which offers free camping to hikers. There is a pavilion, showers, electricity, etc. We had a full house and I was happy to be in the pavilion and out of the rain. Probably have a small mile day tomorrow as my heel is getting worse and I'm just limping along. Thankfully I plan to get off trail on Sunday and take a few days off in New York City...so I'm hoping that gives it a chance to heal.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569831,"It rained cats and dogs all night. I had planned to sleep on a picnic table in the pavilion but, the mosquitos were so bad, I simply set my tent up inside. Worked great, my tent stayed dry, and slept well. 
Got up early as people were coming to the pavilion to pack up out of the rain. Had coffee and conversation as we waited on the storm to blow away. By 8am it was clearing and by 8:45 the sky was blue so, out of excuses, I left the friary and headed to the AT. 
It was slick and muddy so caution was the word of the day. (Only had one tough slip but caught myself before face planting into the hill.) Upstate NY was putting on a show again and the musky, wet forest glistened in the drying sun. ""Ain't it Strange"" by Drivin' & Cryin' was the first song to really meld with my footsteps as I cruised up Canopus Hill. A few minutes later I found myself stopped in a clearing on top of said hill looking out on the valley dancing to ""Don't Ease Me In"". Actually, I was staring at this enormous pine tree with cool drooping cones emblazoned against a perfect blue sky and didn't realize I was dancing until dropping my snack interrupted me. It was one of those enchanted moments that comes along out here. Nature had grabbed me and everything else in the whole wide world disappeared. (Another one of those things that is hard to explain to folks back in the 'Muggle world'.) I took a picture of the awesome tree. But it just looks like an ordinary tree now...Guess you had to be there. 
Around lunchtime I came to Denny Road and there was TRAIL MAGIC! Two of Action Jackson's friends that live in Brooklyn, Tenure and BoyPockets, came out and hooked us up with SUPER magic: Hot dogs, boiled eggs, veggies & hummus, homemade brownies & muffins, cookies, oranges, sodas & beers, and even icy towels. They hiked the PCT last year and knew how to do it. Ended up sitting with them for 2.5 hours and stuffing myself. What a great way to sit out the hot part of the day. Finally hit the road about 3:00 because I wanted to get to Fahnestock State Park and Canopus Lake. 
Got to the lake about 5pm and, besides a whole bunch of hikers there swimming and enjoying a sunny day, who should show up but Tenure & BoyPockets with all their magic! We all hung out relishing the magic and had dinner too by finishing off all the treats. Amazing kindness. At 7pm the park closed and most hikers headed on down the trail. I headed up to the Fahnestock campground. They set aside three spots for AT thruhikers and they let you stay free. I got spot #1 and they gave me a bunch of popsicles {more magic!} to take to my camp site. I devoured three of them before setting up my tent and took three more to Gavin and Emily, the young hikers from Scotland, in site #2. (Big thanks to the Park Rangers--that was very cool. And, on a musical note, when I stopped by the station to check in they were listening to 'Mexican Radio' by Wall of Voodoo. Awesome!)
Tomorrow Jimmy Reddoch will be picking me up here and taking me back to his house in Rye where we'll be joined by the Horan family for dinner. Afterwards it is back to the Horan abode to spend the night before heading into NYC on Monday. [Cannot thank them enough for helping me work out these logistics. It will be a few days before I post again but this is a much needed break.]
Song of the day: 'Rejoice' by U2. This song rocks. One of my favorites from their early days. (Listened to five U2 albums today after this came on in the shuffle. The whole 'October' album is sublime.)

(Sidebar: Why do people waste so much water? A guy at the campground facilities was using the 'drinking water' spigot to wash a large pile of dishes. Liters upon liters of wasted potable water. That resource is too valuable for such thinking)
Got packed up, Jimmy picked me up and wisked me down the Taconic Pkwy about 9:30am. We stopped to get coffee and, as we were laughing about my difficulty using a car door, this 3 wheeled vehicle called a ""Slingshot"" comes rolling in. I looked at Jimmy like i'd seen a ghost and he started cracking up again adding, ""oh yeah, and we all drive those nowadays"". I felt like I had gone 'Back to the Future'! 
We went to his new home on the water in Rye, NY and it was just beautiful. Though they are knee deep in moving boxes they took time to wash my clothes and feed me. We kayaked to the mill and took a boat out past Greenwich, CT and back. Grand homes dotted the coast, old lighthouses stood like sentinels against the salty breeze, osprey nests crowned snags on the the rocky outcrops...ensconced in the aura of the Chesapeake,  I was blown away by this chapter of my journey through America. When we got back we were joined by the Horan family and we all gabbed and ate while the kids ran, swam, and chased the puppy around the yard. My 'relax-o-meter' was at full go. As the afternoon slipped into evening and the tide pulled away, we walked down to the shore exploring the tide pools and chasing fiddler crabs. Shylah found a giant osprey feather and gave it to me for my collection. (Have collected owl, eagle, hawk, woodpecker, turkey, etc feathers on the trip and sent them home) Eventually our garden party had to end and I went home with the Horan's to Pelham, NY for the night. The kids gave me a tour and showed me all their projects, including a violin concert from Shylah, before Andrew graciously surrendered his room full of Star Wars lego figures to me for the night. What a great day and how incredibly fortunate to have such thoughtful people in my life. Though it has been years since we've seen each other, my brothers dropped everything they had going on in their busy lives to help me get into NYC.

An easy ride found me disembarking in Grand Central Station. Truly an incredible place and an architectural beauty, we walked to the center clock and met Phil Villacci, my next door neighbor. Andy was late for work so he took off one way and Phil & I hit the streets NYC. First stop was across Times Square to the hotel to drop off my pack. Afterwards, we had lunch at O'Briens Pub, went to pick up some supplies (fuel canister, walking stick tip, etc), then off to meet my family! 
Yes, the family flew in to NYC yesterday. Jake had a college visit scheduled at Sarah Lawrence in the early morning but they were back and it was great (GREAT!) to see them. We walked to the Chrysler bldg. to admire the art deco masterpiece, then walked down to the UN. (It was on 'lock down') We crossed the street to see the Protest for Tibet. We told them we supported their cause and they gave Jake a free Tibet flag and took our pictures. (Guess we are on some website of the interwebs looking like troublemakers now!) Later we walked to Central Park and enjoyed the green space. It is the first day of summer break here so families were out in full force enjoying the wonderful weather. With weary feet, we headed back towards Times Square and went to dinner. Delicious tapas, sangria, and a mariachi band. You won't find that on the AT!

Went down to the corner for coffee (delicious--not trailside instant but fresh brewed dark roast) then we all headed down to Grand Central Station to meet Phil. We bought our metro cards and hit the subway. First time trips on the subway in NY are memorable and I could tell the kids were digging it. We rode the #6 down to NYU and then went on a tour. The library is huge, the Village surrounds the 'campus', and Washington Square Park is iconic. We walked through some of Greenwich Village before jumping back on the train and heading to the 9/11 memorial. It is really well done and packs an emotional wallop. Despite looking so different now, you cannot help but be flooded with memories of that day. 
We had a delicious lunch (the food in NYC is so darn good!) and then headed back up to Times Square and our hotel to rest awhile. Despite employing the subway, our feet were working hard in the concrete jungle and feeling it. We didn't sit long. An early family style Italian dinner was on the docket with the Villacci Family before going to a Broadway show (Book of Mormon). What a treat. 
Stayed up late talking and it was so good to be with the kids. {I'm so proud of them and the cool young people they have become. Bet you couldn't tell!}

The comfy bed certainly made it's case that time had come to go home. So did the hot shower, soap, towel, & toilet. But Mt Katahdin is still looming 750 miles north and I must go. I must. 
We said our goodbyes in the lobby. My family hopped in their ""Uber"" to LaGuardia and I began the trek to Grand Central Station. Boarded a train on track 18 & chugged north to Pawling, NY. When I got off I stopped at a deli and outside it a man asked me if I was thru-hiking and offered a ride anywhere. My angel! I told him where I wanted to go and he told me that was the wrong way. If I was going north to Maine he said we should go up hwy22. I told him I needed to go back because I had gotten off early. Apparently that did not compute. Though it didn't make any sense to him, begrudgingly, he took me back about 20 miles to the Taconic Pkwy. (Thank you again, Chet. This saved me hours today and DAYS of hiking south and re-hiking north. You are a Trail Angel!)
With a whole afternoon of hiking time, I hit the ground moving. Miles clicked by. I had to retape my heel late in the afternoon as it re-opened bloodily. Drat. But it wasn't terribly painful and the terrain was downright easy. Couldn't quite make it a 'huge mile day' (given the morning train ride) but I got far. Farther than planned. Will roll into Connecticut tomorrow if all goes well. 
My family got home safe. The cats were thrilled they're back. I'm sad I won't see them again for a while but so glad we had a chance to get together in NYC. I feel recharged. Being apart from them is the absolute hardest part of this journey and it had been much too long.

This is the largest oak tree on the AT. (2.5 ft bigger in diameter than the Keffer Oak). From there I passed thru woods and swamps and came to the AT train stop. I sat and had coffee on the platform. A couple of delightful 'day hikers', Linda & Natalie, stopped to talk and even offered money to buy my lunch. So very, very kind. Once again mankind shows its true colors - if we are willing to 'let our guard down' a little bit we discover how good and charitable people are. 
Once the breakfast was over I headed down the trail (no train came to squash the penny I put on the tracks. Oh well) and through the Pawling Nature Preserve. I flushed a BIG black bear and tried to come around to where he ran off but he was gone. Nice finish to New York though. Yep! Within a mile of that I crossed into the journey's tenth state: Connecticut. Pretty cool. Even cooler, within a quarter mile I hit trail magic as Jack and his family were cooking egg/cheese/bacon sandwiches. I had one, as well as a donut, and some coffee. Took a cold beer with me too. (Thank you again Jack!!) 
CT started out right and got better as the afternoon wore on. I hiked along the Housatonic River (& enjoyed that beer) and took a side trail to Bull Bridge. The covered bridge spanning the rapids, an iconic piece of New England, was built in the 1800's and led to the country store. Jet Pack and I went in for sodas and then sat in the shade to beat the heat of a midday sun. When we got back on the AT we crossed the ""2/3 of the way"" point. (Hard to believe I have less than half of what I've already done left to go!)
Unfortunately the trail decided to remind us how much work we have left. The next few miles were rocky and tough. We arrived at Route 341, the road to Kent, pretty whipped. Unable to hitch a ride, we walked 0.8 of a mile in to town. Jet Pack had a resupply box to pick up. I went in for the ice cream! {It did not disappoint. Blueberry Honey Lavender on a sugar cone for those keeping score at home}

Finally got rolling down the trail just after 9:15. Slow going as a wet AT is a slippery AT. Made the climb up Caleb's Peak and across to St. John's Ledges, affording wonderful views of the Housatonic River valley. The descent was treacherous as the slick rocks and steep decline had to be taken very slowly or risk significant injury. Once down the mountain, the trail stretched out level alongside the river for about 5-6 miles. I stopped for 'first lunch' by the river and washed out my sweaty shirt. (Dried in no time on a rock in the sun) Passed thru fields before ascending up Silver Hill. 
About a mile up I stopped at a campsite and had 'second lunch' and filled up with water. This spot had a hand pump that produced high quality H2O if you worked for it. After 35-40 cranks we had crystal clear sweet water!
The afternoon hiking over Breadloaf and Pine Knob were difficult. Hatch Brook was really beautiful and reminded me of Northern California. Unfortunately, severe weather came rolling in and I was in a hurry to get over and off the ridgeline. I got down before the lightning closed in on the mountain but was subsequently inundated with rain. Hardest rain I've ever hiked in. Tried to take shelter under the tarp but it was pointless. If I had jumped in a swimming pool I would have been drier. Miserable. 
Hiked a few miles on to Pine Swamp and stopped at the shelter.  No way to dry out (99.99% humidity with no breeze or sun) but refilled water bottles, cooked dinner, and set up tent. I wish I was in the shelter as rain is expected most of the night but the bugs are SO bad it is better to be in a mesh enclosure than drained of all blood. 
Discovered I lost my pack towel (maybe left it at the lake at Fahnestock SP before going to NYC?) and am really bummed. Most folks don't carry a pack towel but I used the heck out of mine and could use it now.

The sun was giving a mighty effort to pierce the clouds this morning and that effort was appreciated.

I was down the trail by 8 am with David Bowie's 'Diamond Dogs' album driving my feet (Thanks for the suggestion, RSMiv). Stopped at an overlook about 9:30am to watch the race cars at Lime Rock Speedway below. They were loud & fast. Quite a juxtaposition to my journey and thoroughly enjoyable.   
After a snack, I headed on down the trail as Falls Village, CT beckoned. Though no laundry here, it is the home of 'Toymakers Cafe'. This restaurant (& motorcycle shop) is renowned for its hiker friendly attitude and delicious treats. The reputation is well deserved and I devoured the 'bangers platter' ...twice. Kudos to these folks for taking great care of us stinky hikers!
From Falls Village (Canaan), CT I headed north. Stopped at the hydroelectric plant on the Housatonic to use their spigot. Cleaned two pairs of socks, some underwear, and whiped myself down. Felt great! Headed over the iron bridge, past the 'great falls' (was sorely tempted to get in here but lots of miles lay before me. Some folks were jumping from the high rocks and am usually a sucker for that but stayed true to my plan), and over Mount Prospect. Hiked by the Giants Thumb, a strange glacial erratic, left on Raccoon Hill {Reminded me of the heads on Easter Island} before heading down towards Salisbury. The sky was dark and foreboding and I was sporting full rain attire in the event we had another monster storm like yesterday. Ran into Poppin (she was slackpacking) on the way down and, when I lamented the weather, my wet laundry, and miles I still needed to get done, she said there was room at Maria's Hostel and that's where she was headed. Maria was picking her up just a mile away at the 1500 mark. 
I decided to do it. The allure of dry bed, clean clothes, hot shower, town food was just too much after yesterday's mess. Had hoped to roll up to Massachusetts but came up a little short [5.6 miles away]. It did feel pretty darn good to hit 1,500 miles though! That is much farther than I ever really allowed myself to imagine going. 
Maria is an awesome trail angel too. She is 88 yrs young and opens her home to hikers. She drove us to town for resupply and dinner.

Right back at the 1500 mile mark where I jumped off yesterday. Started the day climbing up Lions Head Mtn. with a terrific view south of Twin Lakes Valley. Descended from there and then had a big haul up Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut. Really nice views! To the north lay the beginning of the Taconic Mtn range that I would shortly enter. Had a second breakfast (an orange, granola bars, & some Pez) to fuel up.
Hiked down from Bear Mtn into Sage Ravine and crossed over into Massachusetts. Yahoo! Welcome to state #11. It was stunning and reminded me of the forest out west with its mossy rocks, giant trees, and cascading stream full of swimming holes. First climb was Race Mountain then up even higher to the top of Everett Mtn. Dropped over to Bushnell Mtn. before descending into the valley. Here we walked through pastures and pine groves for a few miles. Walked past the Shays Rebellion monument ( I love passing things like this... 1787!) on the way to Route 7.

We got a hitch in a few minutes and she drove us 4+ miles to 'motel row'. The others were waiting on a friend as they had plans so they went their merry way. I started checking hotels but the rates were astronomical: 4th of July weekend, so even rundown motels were over $150. Dang. 
Thankfully about 1/2 mile away lay the South Berkshire Community Center on the north edge of Great Barrington. I headed there as they allow free tenting by their pavilion on a grassy field. Perfect! Though the services (showers, pool, etc) had closed I set up my tent, made some tea, and began writing this just before the dark skies (been chasing me the last hour) opened up. The tent may be wet but shoes, socks, pack and I are all dry under the pavilion roof. 
Rain brings out the bugs so I'll wrap it up...
Song of the Day: 'Juggernaut' by Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush. Was listening to this as I was finishing the Bear Mtn descent and rolling into Massachusetts via Sage's Ravine. Great jamming made my feet feel light and nimble. 
(DJ note: this was off Double Live. My favorite Frank Marino jam is on ""Real Live"" in the tune ""Stories of a hero"". His guitar on that one will yank your soul through a cheese grater. check it out)

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570804,"Woke up, packed up, and walked into the community center to take a shower. Though I'd be sweaty & stinky again soon, it sure did feel nice to start the day squeaky clean. I walked back to the main road and stopped at the grocery store. Picked up some bakery goods for breakfast and grabbed coffee at the gas station. Delicious...and over 1,700 calories to boot! I began walking back through Great Barrington with my thumb out. I had walked over two miles before I got picked up by a very nice man on his way to the range to hit some golf balls. He took me back 3+ miles down Route 7 to the trailhead. (Thanks again Angel, you saved me an hour on the pavement!)
Started back through the pastures bathed in morning light then hit the first climb up June Mtn. Through a bit of pine forest and then up East Mtn. I stopped about 6.5 miles in at Tom Leonard Shelter to eat and dry my tent. There were nails in all the rafters so everything could hang in the sunny breeze and went from dripping to dry in minutes. Just down the trail from here I hit Ice Gulch, a deep pine covered ravine that can hold snow into the summer. No snow or ice but it was considerably cooler and beautiful to see. 
Continued on past Beartown State Park and up to The Ledges, a nice launching point over Mt Wilcox. On the far side of the mountain, I arrived at an awesome beaver dam and huge pond. I spent a fair amount of time exploring here as I could not believe the work this beaver(s) had put in to building this mountain pond. They had dropped huge trees and had several more all chewed out and ready to fall in short order. What an amazing ecosystem they had created. (Frankly, I could have spent all day here but am thankful to have had the chance to see it)
The trail spent a few miles rolling thru coniferous dominated forest as it descended toward Tyringham, MA. I stopped at the Shaker campsite (so named for the 19th century Shaker village remnants nearby) as it has pretty nice tent spots and good water. No real phone service however, so this won't get posted today. It also puts me exactly 10 miles from Upper Goose Pond Cabin which is my destination for tomorrow. Looks like a great place to spend July 4th in Massachusetts! (Cabin has bunks for 14, tent pads, covered porch, and beach/swimming/canoeing in pond. No set $$, just donations.)
Song of the Day: 'Too Much Ain't Enough' by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers. This came on as I was bopping down the north side of Mt Wilcox through the big pines. Those pine needles made it feel like I was dancing on a golden carpet. Good stuff.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570888,"Woke up at the shaker campsite and  I hit the ground running... said Goodbye to the 'family campers' that were still gearing up (kudos to the Moms for bringing all those kids out for a week on the trail & to all the kids for having such great attitudes) and headed off through the dewy pasture land. 
First climb was up Tyringham Cobble then down to the marsh. After that was the days only real mountain climb and I hoofed it with a goal to do ""10 by 10"" (ten miles by 10:00am). My goal was Goose Pond and I hit its approach trail at 10...Found myself at this big red cabin by the pond a few minutes later. Met the caretaker (of this AMC run place) and as he was bringing me in I ran into Naps who was taking a zero day here. Sweet! 
The holiday was now in session. I hadn't seen him in weeks and as the day progressed more of my 'Tramily' arrived: El Vago, Action Jackson, Shop Teacher, Not Tonite, etc. After taking a few days off trail last week I wasn't sure when, or if, I would see these fun folks again. Turns out others had taken some time off too or had just slowed down to heal up for the final push. Spent most of the day on the porch and went swimming & canoeing too. Worked on my written journal and the whole Cabin has been working on a monster puzzle. So nice to have no boots on the feet or pack on my back. 
Happy 4th! 
After dinner, Wade the caretaker brought out fixings for S'Mores and we were like a bunch of 8 yr olds. Delicious. Then fireworks started popping off. Love it...

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570982,"Yummy AYCE pancakes and coffee this morning to start the day. Everyone gorged themselves on Wade's good cooking then got packed up. I weighed the pack today and hit 23lbs with food & water. Lowest weight ever and was pleased except my food situation was a mess. My efforts to 'get light' left me a 20 mile hike from nearest food/town and I only had about 2000 calories in my bag. Thank goodness the pancakes filled the tank and, with my little pack, finally hit the road about 8 AM.
Only 1.6 miles out of camp, I hit trail magic in the form of a cooler. Blaze and Naps were already sitting enjoying a breakfast 'Gansett Lager. Oh yeah! Nothing says ""big miles today"" like the preferred beer of Captain Quint from that 70's movie about the big ass shark. The beer nestled in nicely with the all-you-can-eat pancakes and propelled me up Beckett Mtn. At the summit, what to my wondering eyes should appear but a cooler full of Mountain Dew, Coke's, and bananas. By 9:30 AM I knew today was going to be an enchanted one. 
(Sidebar: Of course Hikers will understand what I mean by enchantment but it's complicated to explain it to folks in the Muggle world. Even I don't know the whole recipe but I'd say contains one part ""the hand squeeze of unconditional love from Grandma"", two parts ""The widening of a child's eyes as ice cream is handed to them"", just a dash of ""that moment a millisecond after striking a perfect inside out forehand winner"", equal parts of ""the smell of your Thanksgiving dinner plate under your nose as you say the blessing"", ""sound of a far off train whistle"" and ""The feel of the warm coffee cup in your hands on a cool morning"". Mix in a little  of that stuff you see in Disney movies, a few lightning bugs, and the requisite Eye of Newt and we're probably on our way but, like I said, it's complicated.)
Next came Willing Mtn and then I ran into Plow, a NoBo Thru-hiker from New Hampshire. We chatted and hiked awhile then stopped for a break and he offered me a brownie he got in town yesterday---more trail magic!
We left there and hiked around a large pond and came to Washington Rd. According to the guidebook , 100 yards east sat the blueberry farm of the fabled Cookie Lady of the AT. I stopped in and rang the bell and she answered the blue door with a basket of homemade cookies for me and asked if I wanted anything off the menu on the porch so ...I got 5 farm fresh hard boiled eggs, two ice cold pink lemonades, and a Klondike bar for $5. Sat down in a lounge chair in the front yard and enjoyed the hot part of the day chatting with other hikers there. (Most of the gang from the Goose Pond Cabin ended up there too along with a couple of LASHers*)
About 2pm I headed back down the trail and, an hour later, I ran into...wait for it...trail magic! Sitting at the road crossing was Rob w/ 'Casper the Friendly Van'! I enjoyed a cold beer and a cupcake. Then a fried pie. Then a Dr.Pepper and an oatmeal pie. Eventually we had to go but Rob said he'd meet us in the next town at 6 pm and take us to dinner. Sweet! 
Went flying down the trail to Dalton, MA with a new plan. With only 2 hours to cover the 7 miles, Motörhead was selected on the iPod and I rocked hard. Made it with time to spare-thanks Lemmy!
Casper the Van sat waiting and we piled in for a trip to the Misty Morning Diner. Fantastic. Afterwards Rob took us back to his cabin and we showered up. Went to store for a resupply and am now rolling comfortably with two days of food again. (That should get me over Mount Greylock.) El Vago & Shop Teacher pitched tent & hammock outside. Oh Yeah & Action Jackson took bed and floor space. I told Rob I'd sleep on the couch in the van if that was cool (as I like sleeping in my old van back home) and he obliged. 
What a day. Ate like a king all day with no food. Did 20 miles yet had multiple long restful stops. Wasn't sure where I'd sleep and landed in one of the coolest vans around. Yes, Forrest, life is like a box of chocolates.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571434,"Went to bed early last night and woke up in my tent at Wilbur Clearing Site after a terrific sleep. To my surprise this morning, 5 more people came and set up camp during the night. Most were still sleeping but one, Circus, was up and already heading out. Hadn't seen him since Woodchuck Hole in Damascus, VA back in April. Cool...
Three 1/2 miles in lay the town of North Adams. Had to walk in to the grocery for resupply and ended up eating 2nd breakfast & 1st lunch at a picnic table by the parking lot. Delicious to have brewed coffee and donuts then lunch of salami, cheese, olives, oranges. My pack was heavy as I left town and made the climb out of Massachusetts. Yep, walked into the 12th state: Vermont! It started pouring rain before I got there and the trail was a mud pit. 
Today's walk was on the worst section of trail on the entire AT. Vermont is known for being muddy but it was ridiculous. It isn't even a trail. It is just crap. You can't look at the woods as you walk. No maintenance appears to have been done in years. The forest decimated in wide swaths where folks, trying to avoid the crappy mud, have trampled vegetation and created bogs 25 feet wide. On the bright side, I hit the 1,600 mile mark today and, hopefully, it will get better tomorrow. Putting on wet muddy clothes in the morning will not inspire big miles, however the Glastonbury Wilderness awaits and I am ready to give Vermont a second chance...bring it on!

No hurry as I was considering just hiking 4.5 miles to the road and heading into Bennington for a ""near-o"" day. But talking to Batman over coffee, I decided to do an easy 14 instead. That would get me to the top of Glastenbury Mtn (and two days from Manchester, VT where I could resupply my food bag). 
Got to the road (4.5) about 9:45am and decided to dry socks, shoes, etc in the sunny parking lot. Spread everything out, made some tea, and chatted with other hikers. Everyone was still soaked and muddy from yesterday but spirits were high. The sunshine, and a 'real' trail made a big difference. By 11:15am I was laced up and moving in dry socks, damp (not wet) shoes, and a renewed attitude. The next 9.5 miles were all up hill but not too much mud and it was a fun hike. Several good views, mixed forest, & good company.  
Stopped early today (3:15) when I passed the last shelter before the summit of Glastonbury Mtn. There was a very good water source and camp spots amongst the pines. {Plan to get up early and take in the sunrise up top}

It is a wooded summit but has a 94 ft. fire tower you can climb. I headed up 15 minutes before sunrise (5:21am) and set up the time lapse camera. This is the first fire tower i've been all the way up -and then inside. It wouldn't be the last one today....
Incredible! We could see a 100 miles east as the sun boiled forth in fiery red light illuminating the mountains. An [almost] full moon lay behind us to the west. To the south we could see the light on top of Mt Greylock 50 miles south. The Green Mountains loomed dark to the north as we looked out over the tops of the Balsam Fir & Red Spruce forest. We could see the fire tower on Stratton Mtn 17 miles away and knew it was our goal to climb it later in the day. 
What a great way to start the day. 
Rolled down the trail and did 10 miles by 10:30 and then took a multi-hour break to eat and rest. Followed moose tracks in the mud for awhile but, alas, no moose was spotted. The forest was beautiful and the trail not too difficult. In the afternoon, it was up to the summit of Stratton Mtn, the place where the idea of the AT was conceived in 1921. Talked to the caretaker and then the fire tower beckoned me to climb. The view of Stratton and Bromley Mtn ski runs was great and I could see Glastonbury in the distance beyond the Somerset Reservoir. Amazing from up high and amazing walking back down (from the top to Stratton Pond).

(It was the first time I had seen Sonny since Erwin, Tennessee) Our original plan was to get a ride from Judy or Taxi into town but...Sonny had stayed home for the day so he came and got us and things got magical. 
He took us to the house so we could all shower (my first shower since early Connecticut) and do laundry. Then more hikers showed up. Then more. Then we ordered 7 large pizzas to go with the beer. What an afternoon-great stories and lots of belly laughs. So nice to have the pack off and a sunny day after a morning hike in the rain. Five hours later, they dropped us in town to get our resupply shopping done. Most were going back to the woods from there but I decided to keep my reservation at the Green Mtn House Hostel.

Yesterday we celebrated hitting the ""3/4 done"" point for NoBo's. Pretty hard to believe....
Today the first climb put us on top of Mt Bromley where we sat on the dormant ski lift chairs and looked out over the Green Mtns. The slopes awash waist deep in wildflowers of every color. I drank a soda and celebrated my four month anniversary quietly. Today would be a nice long hike through the Vermont woods on a beautiful summer day...
The cascading sunlight made the ferns on the forest floor appear lit from within. The copse of red spruce trees were punctuated by immense white birch tree trunks. Their bark peeling off in strips the size of a pillow case. As Knopfler's guitar took over the final jam from the piano in 'Telegraph Road', I stood still watching this piece of the illuminated forest breathe. A slight breeze fluttered the needles and I felt goosebumps rise from the middle knuckle on the back of both hands and ripple up my arms to my neck. The sound of the guitar, the smell of the pines, the touch of the breeze caused me to shudder as the whole forest exhaled with me. And so Dire Straits gets the Song of the Day. And I got one of those moments you remember for the rest of your days and just can't do justice to with words.

Upon entering the deli I saw Poomba for the first time since Harpers Ferry. (Really cool he is still out here and close - look forward to hearing him play that guitar he carries some more!)

She is doing the Vermont Long Trail which runs with the AT for over 100 miles. Tom couldn't believe I knew a bunch of people in a Vermont deli but such is the hiker community. You make friends fast and everyone is looking out for each other.
On that note, time for some thank you's... First, to Tom for coming down to south Vermont to get me and giving me a great night off trail.

To my family, thanks for being behind me. Couldn't do this without you!! And finally to my wife... hearing your laugh on the phone this morning got me through today's hike. I heard it in my head all day! Even when I got momentarily lost today,  I thought about you learning to ski on this mountain as a little kid and smiled and then the trail revealed itself again.

Dropped off my pack next door (with the Dartmouth Outing Club) and headed into Hanover proper for coffee. Picked up some supplies then went to tour the college. It is amazing. The first library I went into (there are 8 libraries) housed rare works. On display were Daniel Webster's original Audubon 'Birds of America' Albums from 1825. These massive volumes (300+ original plates, 40""x30"") were the first ordered from Audubon. They are exquisite and I can't believe I had the chance to see them. 
I went into the Baker Library next and ended up there for almost two hours enthralled by the Orozco mural downstairs. Painted from 1932-34, it is a national treasure. Incredibly powerful and moving. I'm simply unable to describe it...but you can learn more about it from here:

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572565,"Through open windows the morning breeze woke me. Summer air here in New Hampshire feels different than it does back home in the Deep South. It can't disguise the fact that it will be a hot one today but what a delicious morning. 
We packed up and Greg drove DaVinci and I back to the trail. Stopped at the Hanover co-op for a few last minute groceries (& second breakfast) and ended up talking for a while with Lauren, the co-op cheese lady. She had an 86lb (yes, eighty-six pounds!) wheel of parmigiano-reggiano cheese to cut up. Interesting to see all the different tools she has to use. (Took a video so I could remember all the info -pretty cool) Honestly had no idea it came like that. Learn something new every day!
The trail does its longest road walk from Norwich, VT through Hanover, NH to the Co-op before heading off into the forest at Dartmouth's soccer field. (3.7 miles) Finally back in the ""green tunnel"" just after 9:00am...
Went up over Velvet Rocks in no time but discovered I had lost my knife. Rats! It was given to me by hikers Goose and Andes the day I met them {at the shelter just before the NOC at mile 136}. It's been a trusty companion and seen a lot of use over the last 1,600+ miles as I'm sad I lost it. 
Went over Moose mountain today and then coming down the other side, 13 miles into my hike, my left knee collapsed. Super painful and I dropped like a stone. After a minute I could put weight on it and I limped down the mountain. I crossed the bog at the bottom and started up the next mountain. I had no choice as there are no roads or places to go. It was 2.8 miles to the next shelter and up almost 1,000 ft of elevation. It took a lot of prayer, a few hard swallowed tears, & almost two hours to get there. I hobbled in, set up my tent, made dinner and ate a pain reliever. Not sure how this will play out. I'm a little distraught and just have to wait and see if I can continue...guess losing that knife was a bad omen, eh?
Songs of the Day:
'Wholy Holy' by Aretha Franklin. The lady can flat out sing. Gave me goosebumps as I walked through the New Hampshire woods. 
'Ride with Me' by Steppenwolf. Was listening to this as I ascended to the summit of Moose Mountain. Not their most famous tune but one of my favorites and pushed me to the top. 
'Trista Pena' by Gipsy Kings. Came on right after Steppenwolf and started just as I broke from the trees into the clearing up top. I don't know the meaning of the words but, as the wind blew cool in the hot sun and I looked down on the valley, the intonation and guitar struck the mood perfectly. Perfectly. 
Life is ...life. Go do it. Or not. You've been given an amazing opportunity to experience God's creation. He loaned you a body and everything. Gave you a free will to do with it as you please. I recommend not wasting the opportunity.","Hanover, NH

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572640,"Woke up and could stand. Stiff. That is certainly nothing new. (""Hiker Hobble"" hits in minutes if I sit anywhere) Limped around, made breakfast, broke camp. My wife's cousin located a clinic a few miles away in Lyme,NH (thanks again, Patty) and I set out for the Grafton turnpike. A :45 minute mile later I found myself on the road and got picked up shortly by Daryl (holy mackarel, I can't thank you enough Daryl!) and driven 4 miles to the clinic. 
Walked in and they asked if I was a patient. Turns out they can't help me because they aren't a walk-in clinic. Receptionist said she didn't think anyone could see me today so I told her, ""OK, I'll just set up my stuff and be lying outside in the parking lot. Maybe a doctor will be available tomorrow??"" She looked at me for a moment and then went to get someone. (Side note: yeah, I was being an asshole but, at that moment, I just couldn't help it. I'd love to pretend i was understanding but I was incredulous. My whole focus all morning was getting to this place. It was an arduous task to pull off while in a lot of pain and then I got 'dismissed'.) Shortly, a very nice doctor brought me some ice and talked through some options with me. Dr. Betsy then went and called Greg, the man I stayed with two nights ago, who said he would come pick me up. Amazing. AMAZING (If you haven't figured out what I mean by ""trail angel"" yet, that is it!)
Greg picked me up in Lyme, NH and drove me to Hanover to the Dartmouth ER. We discussed the difficulty of 'your body betraying you' as we rode along and how hard it can be when things go awry. It hurts. He checked me in to hospital and they took me back to the doctors. 
Hoped it was just overworked and a referral for some cortisone with a few days rest would be the word but wanted X-rays just to be on safe side and make sure there was nothing structurally wrong. 
Ends up the pictures revealed a ""Medial tibial intercondular eminence fracture with a displaced fracture fragment over the medial compartment"". In 'normal speak' that is a piece broke off the top of my shinbone and is in the knee joint. 
Or you could just read it like I heard it:Hike Over.   
I'm glad to get professional confirmation that it was truly damaged but, honestly, I already knew it and faced ""the end of the hike"" this morning. After the other hikers left the shelter at 7am, I sat down and started weeping. Not just crying but bawling. It had to come out because something inside, the dream I suppose, had died. I'd been holding it in all yesterday afternoon as I struggled up the mountain. I'd been holding it in during the evening in camp as I talked to the SoBo's about what lay ahead. I'd been holding it in as everyone laid listening to the owls in the dark and tried to go to sleep. This hike has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I sat on the edge of the shelter, knew 'thru-hike to Katahdin' was done, and let it go. Tears in the dirt. 
(Frankly, I was feeling like I had it beat with just 425 miles to go...boy, did I have that wrong)
Greg picked me up from the hospital. We stopped and picked up Action Jackson in Norwich, VT as he is staying at Greg's house tonight as well. Greg went out and shuttled OK and Chugga back as well. Very cool to able to see these guys before going home tomorrow. I'll hit the bus for a few hours to Boston and then nonstop flight to the ATL. Home before the sun sets. Took me over four months to walk here...
Song of the Day.
""Talked to my wife this morning""
Talking with Jenny gave me the strength to let it go. When we hung up I just knew it was ok to sit down and let it go. She is the song in my heart. The love of my life. 
An amazing thing, life. 
Keep Walking.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572809,"Woke up at Greg's house early with the other hiker trash and had coffee as they packed up to shuttle back to the trail. No rush for me as I wasn't headed to the bus station until 10:45am ... but good to have an opportunity to be with some 'tramily' one last morning. 
Goodbyes are hard. Hikers become good friends fast. I've chewed some tough ground with these guys and had some terrific belly laughs too. Sweat & smiles. I trust this isn't the last time our paths will cross and that certainly is solace to my soul. 
Greg took me right where I needed to be on time and made sure I was all set for the journey home. Truly one of the finest people I've had the pleasure to come across in all my born days. Greg, thank you -again- and I promise to pay it forward. 
The bus ride from New Hampshire to Boston was comfortable. My flight from Logan to Hartsfield featured a few cocktails, a snack, and a classic movie, ""The Princess Bride"". (Highly recommended) Wheeled from the plane door to my family at baggage claim...we grabbed the smelly old pack and headed for home. Balloons and a 'welcome home' sign we're hung over the garage. (Thanks Pam--that is too cool) 
Extremely disappointed that the hike is stopped but seeing the family is quite a balm for whatever ails you!

In March, I felt that if I could just make it to Springer Mountain I'd be ""victorious"". The thru-hike dream was so old and so deeply embedded that to see it come alive would be surreal.   The faith they had in me and the sacrifices my family made to give me the opportunity was amazing. They made the dream a reality and I was #690 out of Amicalola Falls. Officially an AT thru-hiker. Victory!
I walked all spring through State after state in the Southern Appalachian mountains and, as early summer arrived, I found myself in the Mid-Atlantic states. Never hiked there before...victory! 
Rolled into the halfway point at Harpers Ferry on the last day of May and was #484 at the ATC HQ...victory!
The hot days of summer found me trekking through the 'yankee lands' into New England...victory! 
All the way to New Hampshire...ouch
There is a lot, beyond just the walking, that goes into a thru-hike. Hopefully some of that has come out in the pages of this journal. While disappointed to be off the AT, I'm  reveling not only in the memories of a grand adventure but also relishing the new perspective it has given me. Again...Victory!
Trying to adjust to life beyond the woods....well...Lots of ink has been spilled on how to deal with 'the life change' once a long hike is over. Adjusting to the 'regular world' is hard. And it would be nice if I could walk....
But the BEST thing about my journey was the people. And that hasn't gone away! Shoot, the outpouring of well wishes and support just from readers here at Trail Journals has been extraordinary. Dozens and dozens of emails. People from all over the country sharing their hearts, hopes, cares, & dreams with me. My family and friends have been beyond awesome and I'm thrilled to be back and surrounded by them. It's the people in our lives that make all the difference.
When this began so many folks asked ""why""? Though it wasn't the only reason, a big one was my pessimistic & crappy attitude toward humanity had me desperate for change. I was generally pissed at the world and did not like what I had become. Callous, bitter, caustic, and angry. Not the recipe for a good life. Though it was tumultuous for our household and threw a wrench in all our long range plans, we had to press the reset button. And though change is scary it was certainly necessary. 
The AT journey was full of good days and bad days. Full of dirt, views, sweat, stench, smiles, aches and pains. It was an elixir for my soul. A healing tonic that, despite the distance, brought me closer to my loved ones....Victory.

Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581095,"Stopped in at Trail Journals today for the first time in many months. Time to hit the conclusion button...Not a day goes by without thinking of the AT experience. It nourishes me. It haunts me. Thankfully, I find myself still texting daily with ""tramily"" members scattered across America. Our common experience forged a strong bond. Reintroduction into society is tough for all of us. It seems in society the human existence is one where we tend to avoid having meaningful conversations about real life shit. On the trail you can't afford to ""have your guard up"" as you are living a base existence. You must trust. To quote my friend and fellow hiker Namaste, ""The one thing I want to make people feel is valued, as there is nothing more precious than human connection"". The true wealth of the AT experience is that human connection.As for me, ""translating the whole experience"" is still incomplete. Oh how the trail changed me! The trail gave me all i sought ...and more. Figuring out the meaning of what it gave me is difficult. How to incorporate the lessons. How to apply them every day. Learning how to walk all over again....As for the body, it is still healing. Have feeling in all but one toe. Hips and ankles are better. Knee is not capable of resuming the hike yet but it is better. 10 miles/day on bike. Stretching. Rehabbing. Praying.My hope is to continue the journey towards Katahdin in the summer of 2018. Gotta have goals...Life is beyond amazing. Keep walking!",,Home,"Dec 08, Fri",0
Daddy Longlegs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594334,"Well, this is a ""2017"" Trail Journal (and I suppose I will have to create a fancy new ""2018 Trail Journal"" to document what is about to happen) but it seemed only natural to start here as I attempt to bring everything back 'full circle'. After much deliberation (and rehabilitation, elation, & even inebriation), the time has come to continue the journey. My amazing bride looked at me the other night and said ""its time for you to do this"". After some discussion, we have agreed to take this in stages. First up: New Hampshire and the vaunted White Mountains. They broke my leg last year but they did not break my spirit. In 'full circle' fashion, the amazing AT Angel Greg Cook has agreed to help return to me to the Grafton Parkway outside Lyme, NH and so next month I will travel back to Dartmouth to pick up where the journey left off. Should things proceed well, Mt Katahdin will be summited in September. Feel free to join me here or, if you're feeling especially adventurous, on the trail!","
