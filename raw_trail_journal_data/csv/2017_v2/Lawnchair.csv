Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518818,"We have been researching, planning, buying gear, and dieting for 2 months. Now we are ready for the first test: 3 cold days and 2 cold nights headed north from Springer. My wife ""Hikenwrite"" and me. When we do the thru-hike starting in 15 months, I will turn 66 and she will turn 57 on the AT.",,Gooch Gap then Suches,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519175,"So we headed out to try out all our equipment. Took lots of breaks and arrived at Hawk's Mountain at 3p. (5 hours). Decided to set up tent there. Everything worked except the sleeping bags. Thermarest Neo - great. Big Agnes Copper Spur 3 with footprint - awesome. Merrill Polar boots - comfy. Capillene shirt under fleece under Colombia insulated hard shell - warm. Black Diamond poles - never again without them. Under Armor long Johns - stopped the wind. But my new Enlightened Equipment 20F bag was a complete fail. The foot would not close shut - by design. The entire left side would not close - by design. My wife's REI 20F down bag had spent 10 years in a compression bag and it failed. We were SO cold at 23F that we got up at 4:15a and hiked back in the dark for 2 hours.I learned: 34 lb pack, packed for a week trip is not too heavy. I'm 6""3 and 225 and 64. I learned that the AT hike is doable. I returned the $260 EE bag, bought a Big Agnes $290 15F Downtec bag, slept outside in 24F last night, and was toasty warm wearing the same clothes.Headed to Southern Ruck in 10 days. Looking forward to it.",,Gooch,"Jan 04, Mon",7

Returning home for Thanksgiving and the get ready push. Thinking going to do a SOBO flip flop starting at HF WVA. Will be cold, but so will Springer NOBO. That's the plan. My wife is pretty sure she cant do it. But she will follow in the truck camper. We'll see. She's pretty competitive....",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Tue",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551678,"100 days to the start. Just returned from backpacking trip (staying in hostels) across SE Asia. After jet lag ends, going to cook, slice, and dry a turkey. Going to have to buy a small stove since it seems burn ban may be long term . More weight. Ugh.But I'mslowly getting psyched!",,HF WVA,"Nov 21, Mon",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552029,"Returned from 9 weeks in SE Asia 2 weeks ago. Backpacking to hostels with my wife. LOADS of work to do when we got back. Now almost caught up. Switched to a backpack for the trail. Forget the size. Maybe 55L. Anyhow the Big Agnes Storm King zero bag will take up much of the interior. Pack weighs 24 lbs + food and water. I'm 6'3 and currently 235 (hopefully 225 by Mar 1). Going for 3,000 cal/day. At 100 cal/oz, food for 5 days + 2L h2o is 14 lbs. Total 38. So my SE Asia pack is loaded with lead to weigh 44 lbs . Carrying it everyday. Alternating 3 mi one day and stair master climb the next . Will be at 5+ mi before 3/1.
Hope to find an old, slow SOBO guy to walk with, but expect to be solo. Have dried a lot of fruits, veggies and now meats waiting in zips in the freezer. 22 lbs of Boston butt cooking now.My wonderful wife is going to serve as support crew for 6-7 weeks (until I get my legs). My youngest son - bigger, stronger, 41 years younger will join me 10 weeks in when he graduates college. I wonder how long I will be able to keep up with him?89 days we leave for HF!",,Springer,"Dec 01, Thu",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552234,"Ok, I have all my gear ready, but it's almost 40 pounds. Yes, I am 6'3 and 235 so 1,000 cal/day won't cut it. I have packed 5 days worth of food (10 pounds) and 1 day's water (1L) since March 1 there should be plenty of snow and water. I am carrying in my pack an empty 2L bladder so when it get drier, I can carry more h2O. But I think this is too much weight. I see I need to get lighter rain pants, but surely there is somewhere here that seems way off to someone more experienced than me.

Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552262,"Thanks for the suggestions. I carry the 100 ml of grain alcohol because I use it (a) to clean my feet at night and (b) to gargle (yuk!) in the morning and (c) to tend any cut and (d) for a deodorant. So, yes, I have dumped the deodorant and have followed most of your suggestions. I am not sure where to get a lighter package of soap, but probably at a local hotel. Or I could just cut a bar into small pieces that weigh much less than the bottle listed. I have also decided to dump the caribiner, the hydrocortisone (since no poisonous plants in winter - by summer my clothes won't be so heavy), the mirror (I have a cell phone with a selfie feature),and the bag (that stuff can go in the bottom compartment loose. I am going to wear my rainpants as my outer pants instead of what I had planned to wear so I save over a pound there! I have to add the weight of my cell phone, charger, and I forgot nail clipper and extra boot lace. But the net is 2 pounds off! 37 (or 39 if I add an extra liter of water). That keeps me close to 15% of body weight. 235+ 37 = 272. Now if I can lose 7 pounds before then.... 265! Hooray! That's my goal to start. 265. Thanks! See you out there.",,View Entry,"Dec 08, Thu",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552319,"SOBO 3/1/17 from HF WVA.So thanks to some helpful people here and a couple of articles they referred me to, my pack weight is now down to 36.9 lbs! I am making a couple of assumptions. First assumption is that no one is going SOBO from HF WVA on or just before 3/1. That means that I will be the first fresh meat the hungry bears will have seen. If that assumption is wrong, then I can lighten my pack by 12.25 oz more and have it close to 36 which is almost exactly 15% of my start-training body weight (235-238). That was part of my goal.Next, I have decided - after last night - to dump my 4 fly anchors and make them as I go. That means that I dumped 2.3 oz and added 16.45: a cut down machette and case. That is probably a better choice because I can use the cut down machette to cut firewood too, if fires are allowed. [I also decided to not take my Leatherman which weighed 5.25 oz but rather my pocket knife and lanyard which weigh 1.65 oz. Having a digital scale is great! I also added a second 50' of paracord (1.55 oz).Last night I went out in (chill factor) 5F to sleep in my hammock, fly, and zero degree Big Agnes bag with Thermarest Neo Air pad. The Big Agnes bag has no insulation in the bottom - they tell you that up front - to save weight and because it gets very compressed when you lay on it. So, instead, they have a sleeve for the Neo. My mistake was forgetting that the Neo won't go in fully inflated, so I half-deflated it, inserted it, then forgot to reinflate it. So, last night, most of me was warm. But from 3"" below my butt to 4"" below mid-back was cold all night. I think it was because the Neo was not fully inflated. So, I hope to try again tonight in similar conditions.45 minutes after getting in the hammock, the two windward fly anchors blew out in 10 mph wind! I got out and tried to fix it but in the dark all I could do is re-set them and an hour later they blew out again.Lesson to self #1: inflate it after inserting it.Lesson to self #2: hanging the hammock and attaching the fly before dark is not complete: it is HARD to get the bag in the Eno Double Nest in the pitch black dark at 10p. Do it in daylight.Lesson to self #3: Make your fly anchors: ones big enough to hold weigh too much to carry. Lesson learned: except for the cold butt, and the fly flapping in my face (I wear a billed Polar King cap so it was not hitting my face but the end of the bill), the sleeping was great!!!",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Fri",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552481,"I am the family cook. For five months I have also been buying on sale fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. I dry them in my food dryer and pack them away for the thru-hike. But I have not measured how much they shrink in drying. Meats shrink the least, but I was drying cooked chicken last night when it occurred to me to check. So, I bought 5.75 pounds of boneless chicken breast on sale for $1.55 per pound and dried it, packaged it (double packaged in a double zipper freezer zip lock bag or bags put inside a plastic grocery bag), and put it in the freezer (which is now full just of food for the hike. The chicken so prepared in the bags weighed.... 1.65 pounds! It lost 71% of its weight!",,How much does it shrink? WOW!,"Dec 16, Fri",0
Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552554,"In the last 15 months my wife and I have truly explored the world. Sometimes hauling backpacks on public transportation to apartments and hostels, some few times renting a car. Lots of walking (6.2 miles per day average): New Zealand, Tahiti, St. Maartin, London, Istanbul, Lyon, Marsaille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, London, Malorca, London, Krakow, Vilnius, Kiev, Odessa, Batumi, Mastia, Tbisli, Istanbul, London, Istanbul, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore. Now we are packing and repacking and weighing and re-weighing, and drying, and buying and planning.... March 1, 2017 I leave Harper's Ferry West Virginia Southbound to Springer. Then off with our daughter Tiana for a couple of weeks to Europe for her college graduation present, then back to Katadin and Southbound again starting August 1 headed for Harper's Ferry. I have done physically difficult things before. In 2008 I trained for and ran a full marathon. I lost 40 pounds in training, but had a complete tear of my left achilles 3 months before the race and a broken first metarsal on my right foot 3 weeks before the race, but I gutted it out and did it. I have done mentally difficult things. While in law school, I secretly signed up for the MBA program and for 2 years did both full time without either knowing I was doing the other. So, if it is just physically or mentally tough, I should be ok. But I am getting old. How much will that affect me? I don't have any idea. Hopefully, none.For the first six weeks, my wife will track me in our camper, sometimes hiking in a half day to meet me, sometimes meeting me with a hot shower and a hot meal and a Serta Perfect Sleeper. Then, she heads off to achieve her dream: finish her second novel and get the first one published. Four weeks after she leaves, our youngest and biggest and strongest son James joins me upon his college graduation. James is about 6'4"" (my original height) and 205 (that has been a long time for me) and 24 (well, that has been almost 42 years). He will meet me in NC somewhere around Hot Springs on May 23 and go with me to Springer. He will then go to Harper's Ferry and hike back to our meeting place while I take his sister to Europe. Then we meet at Katadin and complete the trip to Harper's Ferry together. That's the plan. First 10 weeks in a hammock except if my wife hikes in to me with a tent. After that, I don't know. Probably we will both be in hammocks. I think that being with James will be the biggest single impetus for me to complete the trail. I had already decided to do it when he decided to join me. But he lived with his mom after our divorce and it was very difficult to get to see him until he went away to college, so the chance to spend lots of time with him is something I covet. Right now, he is in New Zealand with his mom, just there from diving on the GBR in Australia. He will be back December 30th and then we can together get excited about the hike. My wife - who was the original impetus for the hike - is not very excitable but I am and so is he. She is my rock and she (plus all of our kids) is my joy. Life is, truly, good.

Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552598,"So I've measured and unloaded, reloaded and bought lighter, worked and worked and FINALLY! got my pack weight under 35 pounds with 3 days' food (7 lbs) and one liter of water. Then last night I weighed my pack empty. 97oz! That's 6.1 POUNDS! OMG! I'm waiting to see if there is a 12/26 sale then I'm buying a Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60, which weighs 2.1 pounds. Then I'll be at 30.9 pounds plus clothes, poles etc. 47 pounds over naked. Since I'm 6'3 and 240, 47 added to naked seems VERY doable. And that includes 2 luxuries: a Big Agnes ZERO DEGREE XL bag and a 1 lb knife which I may still dump. And a size 15 pair of Merrill Polar high top boots.",,How did I.miss that?,"Dec 24, Sat",0

Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553928,"Wow! This time last week I was going to leave Harper's Ferry SOBO on 3/1 and then flip to Katahdin from Springer to SOBO again. My wife was going to be support crew in the camper 3/1-4/15. Delete all of that. She has kidneY and gall bladder stones and will have treatments on Tuesday or Wednesday every other week for 2 months. So....I'm leaving 1/31 from Springer. My son John is joining me. We are hiking 4 days, coming home to help my wife for 3, then repeat. 2 months of half weeks instead of 1 month of full weeks.

Lawnchair,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554124,"So it begins. An old (65) year old fat out of shape guy with (count em) 6 lower leg surgeries including complete tear of left Achilles and crushed arch on right foot sets out to prove that obstacles are mental. My plan was to start SOBO 3/1 from HF WVA thru the relatively easy Shenandoah while my wife enabled lots of slack packing as she accompanied me in our truck camper for 6 weeks. Plans are what happens until reality sets in. Thinking I had a month more to train for slack packing, my training was 80 flights of stairs up and down, 3x a week. Then Wednesday January 25th happened. My wife has bilateral kidney stones which are very painful and gall stones which make her ill. Her treatments - lipotrypsy and perhaps surgery will happen out patient on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the next TWO months, says the MD. I want to be there, so I must cancel the hike. But 3 of our 7 adult children are going with me. We have bought the plane tickets. We have bought the gear. What to do?Friday January 27th while having lunch with son John, 38, in Chattanooga, a plan developed. What if... instead of hiking every week in March, I hiked half weeks in February and March? John volunteered his car, Donna then volunteered hers. We can leapfrog Th-Sun or Wed-Sat and be home to help Donna the rest of the week. Donna loved the tlc. But then we had from the night of the 27th until noon on the 31st to get ready!John and I grabbed our gear and met at Woody, dropped a car there and at Springer, walked to the top of Springer with full packs, and left Springer Jan 31 at 4p. In the next 70 hours we covered 20.1 miles and slept a lot. I brought double too much food (4 days - 14.5 pounds) and water (2L - should have been 1.5).Now I'm back home helping my wife and preparing to take on Blood Mountain later thisvweek. A great plan.
