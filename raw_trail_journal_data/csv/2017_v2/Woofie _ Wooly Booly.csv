Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556361,"There's not much to do to prepare for our hike this year. We already have all the supplies we need left over from last year's record-short hike. So, this year we're just getting ourselves ready by keeping active.
We've had such a warm winter that staying active has been easier. In January, we took a day-hike from the Weverton Cliff trail head up to the Ed Garvey Shelter and back. Had a beautiful day for hiking, and but for the lack of foliage, it could have been a day in May.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565725,"On a previous hike Woofie found a decal for our car that says, “Inside every old person is a young person…wondering what happened.”  This year, although Woofie has completely recovered from her hike-ending fall last spring and is ready to go again, I’m the one who is “wondering what happened” this year.
As has happened to me the last couple of years, I developed a pain in my right shoulder again this year.  A shot of cortisone always been enough to fix me up before, but not this year.  The arthritis in my shoulder had gotten worse and I needed surgery to fix it.  To be cleared for the surgery I just needed a pre-op EKG and clearance from my cardiologist.  Unfortunately, he refused the clearance.  Or maybe I should say fortunately, he refused my clearance.

It turns out that, as a result of the Lyme’s disease I contracted last July from a tic bite, the electrical signals in my heart were not working correctly, causing some skipped beats as well as occasions where the heart chambers beat out-of-sequence or all at the same time.  Being a very active and (I thought) fit person, I’ve always had a low pulse, normally below 50 while sitting.  But it was only 29 in the cardiologist’s office as I prepared for my stress test.  He decided that I needed no more testing and immediately scheduled for a pacemaker.

I thought the pain in my shoulder was killing me and I couldn’t hike until I got it fixed.  But I found out that without the pacemaker, my heart was killing me, and I might not have survived the shoulder surgery.  

I’ve now had my new pacemaker for 5 weeks and my average resting pulse is 62.  The pacemaker is set to keep at least a 60 heart rate.  I should be feeling much better.  And I would if my shoulder didn’t still hurt and keep me from sleeping well.  But I’m now cleared for that surgery and scheduled for it in a couple days.

Our AT hike for this year will have to wait ‘til next spring.  But we’ll probably be able to do some short hikes later in the summer or autumn.  In fact, we did manage to get in a very short and easy hike along the popular boardwalk section next to Rt 94 near Vernon, NJ during a couple weeks after my pacemaker implant surgery.  Being one of the only handicap accessible sections of the AT, it was perfect for me, because I didn’t need a backpack or my hiking poles.",,View Entry,"May 23, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578607,"Well, the long delay is over.  I’m finally healed from all my ailments.  Woofie is ready to get back on the trail, and I’m with her.
I have a car license plate cover that reads, “I’d Rather Be Hiking the Appalachian Trail.”  After the summer I’ve just been through (pacemaker surgery, shoulder surgery, and a colonoscopy) I can’t even begin to express how true that is.
So we’re heading back to Erwin, TN in hopes of making it to Damascus, VA in two or three weeks.  Fall weather should be much nicer for hiking than spring, and the forecast for the next 10 days is terrific. 
Our plan for the hike is the same as before.  We’re taking our car, full of supplies, leaving it at a waypoint (town or hostel) along the trail, getting shuttled a few day’s hike north or south, hiking back to the car, then driving to the next waypoint.
We’re driving to Uncle Johnny’s on Saturday, Sep 30, and we’ll be back on the trail either that afternoon or the next morning.  Looking forward to meeting lots of SOBOs.",,View Entry,"Sep 26, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578848,"So far, so good. We made it Erwin in about 8 1/2 hours driving time without any complications and checked into the Super 8 motel for the night. We called Uncle Johnny's and arranged for a shuttle tomorrow morning to take us about 12 miles north on the trail, where we left off last time.
Just one glitch--the Huddle House we planned to eat at is gone--permanently closed. 
Can't wait to hit the trail!",,View Entry,"Sep 30, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578993,"Got a shuttle this morning at 8:30 from Uncle Johnny's and was back on the trail at Deep Gap, where we left off, by 9:15. Our shuttle driver was the same one who picked us up from there when we had to leave because of Woofie's injury. It was nice to see 10-K again. It was only 47 degrees when we started, but sunny and breezy, so it warmed up to about 70 by noon. 
The highlight of the day was arriving at The Beauty Spot. It's actually a mountain top known as a bald. No trees on top, just grass. So the view was magnificent in all directions. With today's clear weather, we could see what seemed like forever. 
Woofie did great today on her first day back on the trail. She was very careful not to fall. She does 70 on the trail, and follow I behind. I only do 68, but in about three weeks I'll be doing 69. 
We got to Curly Maple Gap Shelter by 5:30. We had just enough time to fix our meal and set up camp before it got dark. It's 56 degrees, and we're in our tent tonight. It's warmer than in the shelter.","Deep Gap

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578996,"Last night in our tent we were snug and warm, while outside the temp dropped to 54 and a strong wind whistled through the trees.  We heard tree parts hit the ground several times, and once something quite large landed on the tin roof of the shelter with a huge bang.  Luckily, nothing hit our tent.
 Dawn arrived around 7am, and we got packed up and on the trail by 8:30.  It wasn’t long before we began seeing the results of the previous night’s winds.  In several places large trees had blown down across the trail.  We could tell they were new blow-downs because the surrounding foliage was upside down, but still green.  Woofie had to take off her pack to get under one tree.  I took to high road, opting to climb over it with my pack still on.
Although it was a shorter hike day than yesterday, it was much harder on Woofie.  It was quite a steep descent for a couple miles with loose rocks and stones across the trail.  Some of it looked like the dry bed of a stream that flows during heavy rains.  And although the leaves have started to turn color and litter the ground, making for a beautiful autumn view, it made the trail quite treacherous to Woofie, who is still nervous about falling, especially because the leaves hide the rocks.  Getting to the bottom of the descent, although successful, was extremely taxing on Woofie.  She didn’t enjoy that part of the hike. 
With about a mile to go, we stopped along the trail, had some snacks for lunch, and chatted with a day hiker who happened by.  During the last mile to the car, it was obvious to me that Woofie was having trouble with pain, and finally she asked if we could be done hiking when we got to the car.  I guess doing 70 isn’t so easy, after all.  But she and I had the most beautiful couple of days on the trail that anyone could have asked for.","Curly Maple Gap Shelter

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582036,"We spent the Thanksgiving holiday in my home town, Warwick, NY, which just happens to be only four miles from the Route 17A trailhead on Mt Peter between Warwick and Greenwood Lake, NY.  What better way to celebrate Thanksgiving day than to hike on the AT!  And given the kind of year I’ve had to endure, I’m very thankful to be able enjoy AT hiking, at all.
We chose to go to the village of Greenwood Lake and hike up the Vista Trail.  It’s the blue blaze trail that goes right from the village, up the side of the mountain past the village water tanks, and after a few switchbacks reaches the crest of the mountain and the AT.
At the bottom of the Vista trail is the village softball field, and next to that is my grandparents’ house, the one my mother grew up in.  As a young child I used to play there at the base of the mountain before the ball field was there.  And I climbed up as far as the water tanks, even though my grandmother warned me not to because of the copperheads that she knew were there, especially in the summer.  But back then I wasn’t really aware of the Appalachian Trail, accept for the AT sign on top of Mt Peter that I’d see every time I went to or came back from Nanna’s house.
And so, I was very excited about this hike, even if it was only a day hike.  We parked right next to Nanna’s house, (It’s not hers anymore.) and crossed the ball park to the trail head.  It was a perfect fall day in the 50’s and sunny.  The leaves had all fallen, covering the trail and everything else, but opening the forest to reveal deeper views into the scenery.
Although wonderful to look at, the Vista Trail was harder to negotiate than expected.  Woofie was especially wary because the leaves hid all of the rocks, sticks, and stumps that could lead to a tumble.  And so, slow and cautious was the order of the day.  Even though the crest looks quite close from the bottom, because of the switchbacks it’s almost a full mile’s hike to reach the AT.  It took us about an hour to reach the AT, and we knew it would take about the same time to get back to the car from there.  So that only gave us a couple hours at most on the trail because of rapidly failing sunlight in the afternoon at that time of year.
On the actual AT the trail was much easier.  It was fairly straight, running along the crest, and free of leaves that must have been blown away by the wind.  The climb was worth it.  Gorgeous views of the village and the lake were almost continuous as we moved from one outcropping to the next along the trail.  But all too soon the sun reached the horizon, and it was time to do the hike in the opposite direction while the light lasted.
The trip back down the Vista trail took less time than we thought, but it still wasn’t easy.  We understand now why thru-hikers don’t often use it to get to Greenwood Lake.  At a mile each way, it’s a lot of work for a hiker, especially with a fully resupplied pack to carry back up.  But it makes a great day hike in the fall, when the leaves are down, and there are no bugs or snakes to worry about.
Woofie and I are anxious to get back on the trail this spring again, traveling north from TN and into VA for a couple months.  I’ll be starting our 2018 Journal soon.","Greenwood Lake, NY
