Total AT Miles 418.4
Today's goal was short and quick. We had just 9 miles and then into the hostel to wait for GQ.  There were two hostels at the road crossing, each in opposite directions. We all had packages being delivered to the Kincora Hiking Hostel, but for three days we had been calling with no answer. It made me a little nervous for our packages, but in the reviews online everyone spoke highly of the hostel. Yesterday, while at the trail magic, Powder spoke highly of the Black Bear Resort, so while we had service we called and made reservations. We made it to the road crossing before the rain. We walked to Kincora and found our packages without any problems. On our way back the other direction to the Black Bear is where we hit rain, but we didn't mind much. It was an easy road walk, under a mile. At Black Bear, we had a cabin to share between the four of us. Laundry, showers, resupply, and eating took place most of the evening. We were tempted with ideas of slack packing the next day, and without much discussion we jumped on the idea.","Campsite

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553876,"In 2014, I convinced my husband, Kyle, that it was a good idea to invest a bunch of money into backpacking gear, and go spend 3 days on the Appalachian Trail. It just so happened that those 3 days of hiking through The Shenandoah National Park were spent with a group of thru-hikers. We fell in love with the trail during those 3 days sitting around the camp stoves at night listening to the stories of the thru-hikers. The reasons that brought them to hike the trail, what they had learned along the way, and how their lives had changed were all topics we were excited to discuss. The one question they had for us was ""when are you going to thru-hike?"" Before heading out on that 3-day adventure on the trail, we never would have considered hiking for 6 months; however, something about the way we were looking at life changed. We were working on our ""American Dream."" We had the jobs, next step we buy a house and have 2.5 kids? Is this really what we wanted? Hiking 15 miles a day for 3 days gave us a lot of time to discuss this question. We realized: first, we are young and have a lot of time ahead of us to pursue these things if and when we want them: and secondly, just because careers, homes, and children are what our peers are pursuing, does not mean that is the way our life needs to play out. The American Dream is just a template and it’s a good one, don't get me wrong, but we ultimately decided we wanted something different. We enjoyed our jobs and still do but we discovered that we wanted to work to live, not live to work. Right now, we desire adventure and experiences versus job titles and home furnishings. So after those 3 days, our lives changed drastically. We made the decision that we wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. What would give us more adventure than spending six months in the woods? Well we were ready to find out. We decided we were going to hike the Appalachian Trail in 2016. It looked like 2016 was going to be a promising season until Kyle fell and tore ligaments, tendons, and destroyed the cartilage in his ankle. Surgery and months of physical therapy became our new reality. At that point we knew that we would have to re-focus towards the 2017 season. Although this change in timeline was a disappointment at first, it turned out to be a positive. During 2016, Kyle started a job with REI, which helped to build our gear and our knowledge. We also added another member to our hiking party: our good friend, Brock.Hiking the Appalachian Trail is something we have actively been working towards for the last 2 years, and we are beyond excited to start our hike in March.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Fri",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554126,"When sharing with friends and family our plan to hike the Appalachian Trail I was surprised to find that many people have never heard of it let alone know what a thru-hike looks like. So this is post to help clarify just how crazy this idea is. Yes, we know this is crazy, but seriously here are some facts about the trail.What is an AT Thru –Hike?The Appalachian Trail, or AT, is a 2190 mile hiking path. It crosses 14 state lines, stretching from Georgia to Maine. We will be attempting a thru-hike, meaning we will hike the entire trail straight through. Around 2000 people attempt a thru-hike of the AT each year, but only 1 in 4 will finish. Most hikers will quit within the first 100 miles.How long will it take you?This takes hikers anywhere from 5-7 months to complete. After starting around March, a hiker typically will summit Mt Katahdin, finishing their hike north, in late August to late September. There is a risk of pushing past September, because Baxter State Park will close due to weather, and this typically will happen in the first to weeks of October. Where will you start?We will be considered northbound or NOBO hikers. This means we will start at Springer Mountain, Georgia, which is the southern terminus and hike north to Maine ending in Baxter State Bark on Mt Katahdin. One can also hike the trail South from Maine to Georgia, called Southbound or SOBO. Or you could even flip-flop meaning you hike one direction until you reach half way then you would drive to the opposite end and hike back to middle, still allowing to you to complete the entire trail. What is the elevation like?The highest peak on the AT is in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Clingmans Dome at 6,644 feet. The elevation change, or the gain/loss, over the whole trail is 464,500 feet. That is the equivalent of climbing Mt Everest 16 times. How do you know where to go?The AT is marked by the White Blaze, which is a six inch white vertical paint stroke that can be found on trees, rocks, signs, and even lamp posts through towns. So you have to carry everything you need with you?Yes. In order to do this, a thru-hike a hiker will carry all their gear with them in a backpack. The gear consists of clothes, tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, a backpacking stove and pot, food, water, and a few other items (but this is the bulk of it). Most hikers will be carrying between 20-30lbs.What will you eat?A hiker's diet needs to consist of high calorie foods, because they will burn around 6000 calories per day hiking. Sometimes a hikers diet can get a bit tricky, because high calorie foods are not always light weight, and good for packing. Some hikers begin to look at their food as calorie per ounce. Some common backpacking foods include, rice, pasta, freeze dried meals, tuna, chicken, summer sausage, pepperoni, butter, olive oil, cheese, nuts, protein bars and shakes, oatmeal, bagels, and peanut butter. Seeing as you can’t carry 5- 7 months worth of food with you, a hiker will resupply in towns along the trail. This happens approximately every 3-5 days. As you maybe can imagine, eating the same things over and over again causes some food fatigue. A hiker will dream of arriving in towns and eating a warm meal or two. Where will you sleep?When hiking the trail, yes, you do camp along the way. Many hikers carry tents that are set up and torn down each night as they move from place to place. Another common accommodation for hikers, are the many shelters along the AT. A shelter is a three-sided structure with platform floors for multiple hikers to sleep. Shelters are great options for stormy nights, or when you are just too tired to set up your tent. In towns, many hikers will choose to spend the night in a motel, or in one of the many hostels along the way. Motels and hostels allow hikers not only a real bed but also a shower.How many miles do you have to hike a day?To hike the trail in 6 months, hikers will average about 15 miles a day. This mileage will vary based on terrain and physical ability. A hiker might choose to start slow with lower miles to avoid overuse injury, or blisters, and also due to physical limitations. Then, after a couple of weeks on the trail a hiker gains their ""trail legs."" This means their legs are feeling conditioned to the trail. At this point, hikers would start to increase their mileage, many hiking upwards of 20-30 miles a day. The northern section of the trail is considered to be more challenging, due to terrain and frequent elevation change, causing many hikers to slow down. Trail Magic or Trail AngelIf a hiker is really lucky, they will get to experience the generosity of a ""trail angel."" A trail angel can come in many different forms, but most commonly it is a person who will go out to the trail loaded with food, candy, or soda, and generously give to the hikers that pass. This food, candy, or soda that a hiker receives is called ""trail magic."" Trail magic can come along when most unexpected, but maybe most needed, and that is why it is magic. What is a trail name? A great tradition of the AT is taking on your ""trail name."" Other hikers most commonly give a trail name to you. It may be reflective of your personality, maybe something unique about you, or associated with a specific story on the trail. When a hiker gets their trail name, it sticks with them through the entirety of the trail. It becomes their new identity, as many don't know each other’s real names. This is an overload of information, I know, but I wanted you to get a picture of what our lives will look like over the next 6 months. These are answers to the questions we get asked most frequently when we tell people about our hike. Have more questions? Feel free to ask. We will do our best to answer or find the answer.",,What is the Appalachian Trail: FAQ,"Feb 04, Sat",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554219,"This journal is from a few weeks ago when we vacationed with our family in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.Gatlinburg brought with it many emotions. As we are now 2 months away from starting our journey on the Appalachian Trail, we looked at Gatlinburg, specifically the Smoky Mountains, with a new lens. As we approached the city we could see the mountains in the distance, and our insides started to stir. Daily, the reality of our hike has started to set in. For us however, nothing like staring at the Appalachian Mountains and hiking in the green tunnel has seemed so real. We had a nervous excitement while on the trails and we wanted so badly to just keep hiking. What we found fun and exciting was to talk, plan, and strategize with our family. We knew they would be our biggest support system, mentally and logistically, but to see them get excited with us made it so fun. We know they will be instrumental in spurring us on to the end. This week, while hiking trails through the smoky mountains, we were able to share our love of the outdoors with our family. One thing we always appreciate about hiking is seeing places you would never see unless you set out on foot and hiked there. However, this week we also learned that the company and conversation is just as beautiful.We also had the opportunity to see Asheville, which was something I was excited for because it will be a ""support headquarters"" for the southern portion of our hike. Kyle's parents recently bought property in Asheville, and this was the first time seeing the property, surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains, that we will be hiking through. ""Where's The Next Shelter?"" author Gary Sizer tells the story of his Appalachian thru-hike. He happened to be from the Asheville area, and his wife was a huge support system for him through the southern portions. So after reading his account I knew that having our own support system in Asheville was going to be a huge encouragement. This week gave us the time we needed to look at dates, miles, and road access in the area for family to come share in this journey with us.",,Gatlinburg,"Feb 06, Mon",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554680,"These next several posts, although not directly related to the AT, are part of our AT journey. In order to start the AT, we had to pack up all our belongings and move from California back home to Indiana. The next several post will document our journey back to Indiana, which will include lots of hiking and camping. It will allow us to test out some new gear, and maybe finalize our gear list. And as always, road trips are never without hiccups, which test and grow you, if you let them. Hopefully, they are lessons that we can take forward with us towards Katahdin.",,Our journey back to Indiana,"Feb 13, Mon",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554681,"We left las Vegas early due to the fact that we had all our belongings in our car. When we checked into the hotel we found out we didn't fit into the garage and would have to park in the oversized lot. The valet told us to take our bikes in with us, which then concerned us for the safety of our vehicle. We had 3 bikes and a suitcase to get inside, through the crowds of the casino floor, and up the crowded elevators. I was not looking forward to this, and honestly was willing to tempt fate out of laziness, but Kyle always seems to do things the right way even if it's more work, or even when he is tired. This is a quality I am working on and hope to see grow in me. We didn't really mind having to leave early because, although seeing all the lights and walking through the decorated hotels was fun, when the sun comes up its not as impressive. So onto Zion we went. the drive between Vegas and Zion is about 2.5 hours. The scenery is enough to make the time go by: desserts with large red and brown mountains, some that plateau, others that have flat rock faces. Also sprinkled throughout these mountains were smaller canyons with river bottoms. Not having spent any time in this region, it was the first time we had seen anything like it, and we were impressed. We had a camping spot picked out that was a free backcountry area, one requiring 4 wheel drive and had many cautions posted at the entrance. We gave it a shot, but as the grade began to increase and the ruts in the dirt path got deeper we decided to turn around. Plan B was camp within Zion. I would definitely recommend staying at watchman Campground. Nestled between a small river and mountains, the scenery is beautiful. The sunset on the rock faces offered a red glow as we set up camp for the night. For dinner we had a chance to try out our new cooking system, the snow peak GigaMax lite and GSI dualist pot system. The cooking capacity of the dualist 1.8L pot I think will be desirable after our hiker appetites kick in. We also tried a new ""trail recipe,"" loaded mashed potatoes. Instant mashed potatoes have been a staple of ours in the past, but adding cheddar cheese and bacon take this easy meal to a whole new level. Tonight's temperatures are supposed to drop to a low of 32, so we should get a feel of how our cold weather gear will handle.",,Vegas to Zion,"Feb 14, Tue",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554682,"Our cold weather gear was cozy in the comfort of our tent and sleeping bags. We were even comfortable as we were moving around camp while packing up. Eventually we made our coffee and breakfast, and remembered that making breakfast in the morning is a cold process. At least to start the trail, until the mornings are a little warmer, we will probably eat breakfast on the go. Get up, get moving, and get warm. Waking up around 5am meant we made it to the trail head in enough time to get in two hikes...Kayenta trail to Upper Emerald Pool trail- 3+ miles 1.5 hours.I say 3+ miles because the actual trail was 3 miles, but there were several side trails, vistas, and, for Kyle, rock scrambles. It was a fun easy trail with nice views of 3 waterfalls. After we finished it was only 10 am, so we had to figure out what was next. Well, our trail head was also a starting poiny for Angel's Landing. So onward we hiked, and climbed. Angel's landing - 5.4 miles, elevation change 1488, 2 hours 15 minutes.The most frightened I have ever been. The trail is narrow and steep with long drop offs on either side. There are guide chains avaliable to hold onto, but I can't say they put my mind at ease. The views were amazing, but honestly I was too distracted by how scared I was as I  concentrated heavily on every step I took. Kyle and I are a bit fearful of heights, so this was not a favorite of ours. I wanted to attempt it to face the fear, but fear in this scenario is legit, and I think a natural response. We left Zion for Bryce, just a 2 hour drive, where the adventures begin again.",,Zion Hikes,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555293,"Waking up to see the temperature was 16°  gave us no motivation to get up and get moving. We took an easy morning and had coffee and breakfast in our hotel room, made reservations for  guided snowshoeing at Bryce, and waited for it to warm up. By the time we got to Bryce, we could not have asked for better weather. We had just over an hour before our snowshoe time slot, so we stopped in the visitors center to see what we should do to fill the rest of our day. The Ranger quickly gave us a list of 9 different things to see and do. We had two overlooks to see before or snowshoe time. At the first overlook we were awed. I had never seen anything like it. In front  of us was a massive canyon with thousands of hoodoos, which are basically pillars of rock. They are one of the oddest looking things I have ever seen in nature. So, each over look gave you a different perspective of the canyon, or a different grouping of hoodoos. Some even have names for their distinct shapes. Kyle and I have never been snowshoeing, but have recently been very interested to try. The Ranger guided tour was completely free, including all your gear. That just blew my mind. Our total milage covered was about a mile, and by the end of our time, I really felt like we were getting the hang of it. The tour took us along the canyon edge, and the Ranger informed us of park's history, animals, and plant. After the snowshoeing it was a race against daylight. More scenic vistas and ending our day with a 1.1 mile or 3 miles hike dependent on daylight. This hike took us down into the canyon, which was a vantage point we had not yet seen. However, we knew down in the canyon would loose light faster. We had 1hour and 30 minutes until sunset and the Ranger said plan for 2 hours for your 3miles. Kyle and I typically hike at a faster pace than that, but with with snow on the trail and elevation we were not sure if we could finish before sunset. We had a turning back point in mind, but when we made it there in a rather fast pace, I pushed us forward knowing we would finish in plenty of time. We did, and I am so glad we pushed on. Hiking on the canyon floor looking up at the hoodoos towering above was an amazing experience. We left the park,and headed to Capitol Reef National Park. Our 2hour 30 minute drive kept our hearts racing and our eyes peeled. It common to see deer along the side of the road, but on this drive we saw a massive elk, that's rack was as big as our front windshield, and then 2 mountain lions ran in front of our car. Although our hikes were not long today, between the snow causing us to use extra muscles, and the hikes from yesterday, we are tired and a little sore. Hopefully, a little stretching can go a long way to help ease the muscles, so that we can get back at it tomorrow. Capitol Reef is one of those hiccups in our plans. We originally had planned to head to Horseshoe Bend, but last night at dinner we saw a map of all the land marks and realized how out of the way Horseshoe Bend is. So, we will see what adventures Capitol Reef has in store for us.",, Bryce ,"Feb 16, Thu",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554945,"Capitol Reef loomed with dark clouds, threatening rain all day. Although it never rained on us, it caused us to hike fast. We did a few short trails within the park as to not risk getting stuck out in the rain. Normally rain doesn't bother us, but with several warnings of flash floods, we didn't want to take any chances. Capitol Reef, is special in a geological and historical way. With not much in the way of hiking, there were several vistas that showed how the areas was formed, and also several historical sites. There are lasting carvings left on the rock faces from the Native Americans who once lived in that area. There are also buildings that have been preserved from the Mormons who settled in the canyon. This was a welcome change of pace from the high activity level of our previous two days. We left Capitol Reef and headed for Arches National Park. With rain threatening there as well we hoped to set up camp before rain came in. We got to the park to find the Campground was full. The second Campground was also full and then we realized it was a Friday night. We pulled into the sketchy roadside RV park with no sign in and no one working the front desk. So we drove back to the tent spot and found that each tent pad had a shelter covering it, perfect for the the threatening rain. Who knows, it might just be free. So off to Arches tomorrow to explore. I am already wishing we had an extra day to explore on our bikes. There is a pretty impressive trail system all along the Colorado River. But with two days of rain in the forecast and the second day being a constant rain, unfortunately, I think it will just be the one day.",,Capitol Reef,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554949,"Well we survived the night at our sketchy RV park. Our night of sleep was a little interrupted due to road noise, and a loud group of people making their way through the campground. We made it into Arches National Park pretty early, which was helpful in beating some of the crowds. Arches is a linear park and between each arch site there is not much to see or do. This means everyone is headed to the same areas. I  enjoyed all the quick hiking opportunities at Arches. We did 3 smaller hikes equalling about 7 miles. Each hike takes you to views of different arches. Overall it ended up being a quick park for us. There were some other longer trails, but with the active rain and not wanting to spend the whole day on one hike, we opted out. Delicate Arch Hike: 3 miles, 1hour. Delicate arch was our longest hike of the day. It takes you right to the base of Delicate Arch, which is the iconic arch of the park. The description of the trail made it sound a little intimidating, and maybe a little risky. I think we were still a little weary after our Angel's Landing hike. The description spoke of steep ledges and slick rock, especially when wet, and it was actively raining. When we got to the trail head, the lookout points to see the arch were closed, so we knew the only way to see it was to make the hike. I am glad we did! The trail was well worth it, and it was much more mild than the description made it sound.Upper/Lower Windows and Double October Arch: 2 miles, 30 minutesWe strung together these 2 short trails with views of the Upper and Lower Windows, Turret Arch, and Double O Arch. These were very light trails with little to no elevation change but great views of the arches and the plains beyond the park. We spent a little extra time working on our photography skills here, so it took is a little longer than it should have.Landscape Arch: 2 miles, 45 minutesThis trail left from the Devils Garden Campground (which we had intended to stay in). Straight away it takes you between two massive slabs of sandstone that form a narrow corridor. You then travel in a fairly uneventful manner until the trail splits. The complete loop trail of devils garden is roughly 8 miles, however, we stuck to the short 2 mile out and back to see landscape arch. The trail has next to no elevation change which makes it a relaxing jaunt to the informational plaque about landscape arch. You can travel just a short distance further to get some truly remarkable pictures. This one got Kyle's vote for ""Favorite Geological Formation of the Day.""I had some emotion leaving the park, because it was really our last site seeing stop of our trip. I had enjoyed stopping every day at a new National Park, and seeing amazing sites. I was scrambling wanting to add to our trip and find new places to explore. We have the time, but our ultimate goal is the trail, so home we headed. Although Colorado has so many amazing things to offer, we decided to speed through it. We have been on the road for a week now and, although we have made this trip relatively inexpensive,  we are officially  unemployed, and each day on the road is more money. We saved well for the trail, but it is a little unnerving not having any income. So we are now homeward bound. We are just one month away from leaving for the trail. This trip, although nothing like being on the trail, did give us some preparation-both physically and mentally.",,Arches (...and Arches and Arches),"Feb 18, Sat",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555292,"Now that we are back home in Indiana, I have started to have this nervous energy. If you have ever been apart of a race, like a 5K or a marathon, there is this period before the gun fires to signal the start of the race when everyone is waiting in their corrals, some stretching, others warming up, some with their ear buds in tuning out the distractions. There is an anxious energy in the air. All the time and training will be tested and you are waiting for the signal to start. This is how I feel. It’s like I am in the corral waiting for my signal that I can start. Being home and unemployed, we have no excuse for planning, and training. We have a large support team in our family, and they are excited to get out on the trails with us. We had a group of nine that hit the trail, some had loaded packs, testing new gear, and getting the feel of weight on our backs. In central Indiana we lack a lot of long distance trails, and seriously lack elevation. So, our hike consisted of 7 miles of trails, and 20 minutes of stairs equaling another mile. It was a great hike for our family to get a feel for their new gear, and also to know what adjustments need to be made. After our hike, the hiker hunger was already setting in. We all gathered for dinner and after taking down a few pulled pork sandwiches each, we were able to trail talk. We called a “Family Meeting,” to finalize who was coming out to the start of the trail, transportation, and the first few meet up locations. My (Jordan speaking) dad will be starting the trail with us for the first five days. The second week, my stepfather, and little brother, will be joining us for a week. Then, as we approach Asheville, Kyle’s parents will be available as trail angels, providing food, showers, transportation and lodging. And, with our trail partner finishing up his last week of work this week, we have plenty of time to finalize all the little details. Everyday the “To Do List,” is getting a little smaller.

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556258,"Last week while out in our town doing a training hike, a journalist for the local paper stopped us, and took interest in our hike. This led to sitting down for an interview,and yesterday we were in the paper. Check it out!http://www.heraldbulletin.com/community/a-long-walk-in-the-woods-for-appalachian-trail-hike/article_aaf613f2-3120-565f-ab8d-7afe972fad9d.html",,We Made the Paper,"Mar 13, Mon",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556526,"In the book “Appalachian Trials” by Zach Davis, he discusses the importance of preparing mentally. He asks you to answer three big questions. The answers to these questions may just be what mentally will get you to Katahdin. The idea we will be exploring today is, “ I am Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail because…..” This is our why. We gave you an idea of how we came around to the idea of hiking the trail in our first post, but this takes it a little deeper. JordanI get asked a lot if I am nervous about hiking the trail. Yes, I am nervous on many levels. Your mind begins to race with so many questions. Did we save enough money? What happens if we get sick or, even worse, hurt? What if I come across a bear, snake, or just a creeper? I found, however, that my biggest fear is: What if I don’t finish? What if I can’t do it physically or mentally? The fear of failing has been crippling at times. I know the statistics and I don't want to be among those who don't make it to Katahdin. I was so afraid of failing that I didn’t even want to try.  I started to discover that I looked at a lot of things in my life this way. What I am learning is, by not trying, you miss so much. Whether I hike one day or six months, what I gain will be so much greater than never stepping foot on the trail. It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. Theodore Roosevelt.I hike the Appalachian Trail because fear of failure is not going to hold me back any longer. There is so much beauty out there to be seen and so many experiences to be had, and I don’t want to miss them!Anyone who knows me closely knows that I am a dreamer. I am always brainstorming on my next idea, or next three. I recently read this passage: “ Dreaming strips life of boarders and sometimes of its reality and damage. Eventually we realize there are limits, and dreaming digresses to the pastime of children. Then most of our imaginations evolve into problem-solving mechanisms. Because enough of our dreams don’t come true that we just stop bothering. We were built with ability to dream but we have lost it.” Jennie Allen-Restless. I can’t imagine living a life without dreaming, and watching those dreams play out. I will be honest though, some dreams scare me, terrify me even, (like hiking the AT). Going back to this idea of fear, I have seen fear keep me from pursuing some of my dreams. Some dreams do take a lot of work and doors do get shut in your face. I find that I need to hike the AT to remind myself that I can accomplish big dreams. Then maybe, I wont stop dreaming those big dreams. I have been struggling with how to express this last why. Maybe, because its raw and vulnerable. Something, I am not totally comfortable with.  It might be cliché to say I want to go hike in the woods to find myself, but the truth is, I still need time to figure out who I am. Who am I away from the distractions of society? Away from a society that tells me how I should look and act. I still struggle with insecurities, self-confidence, and lies that play over in my head, specifically, the feeling that I am not enough. When I am out in nature the distractions are gone and I get to be me. I realize I am enough! A recent video I came across Hilary Oliver states, “Out here I start to forget how society tells me I should look or feel. Or what other people think. Here I am enough.”- Being Here When I heard this, I knew I was not alone in my feelings. The longer I am away from the outdoors I begin to grow restless. I need that quite, to escape, to reset my thinking, to remember truth. For me a huge part of being out in nature is being close with its creator. At times I feel closer to Him on a trail than I do within the four walls of church.  His truth reminds me that I am enough. I will always find the need to seek the quite and stillness, to seek Him. I hike because, maybe in these six months I will find at a deeper level I am enough; a deeper understanding that still remains when the distractions come back. KyleI don't know if my reasons for hiking the AT are normal or otherwise, but these are the thoughts that will hopefully drive me towards my goal every day.I have personal demons to overcome, the more obvious one being an ankle injury that required surgery and initially postponed our hike from 2016 to 2017. The underlying haunt is a lack of self-understanding, which I believe I'm far from alone in experiencing. A few times in the past couple of years I've thought myself to be on a successful life path, only to change course and feel a bit lost again. I don't expect to experience some marvelous revelation and end up a billionaire. I do, however, hope to find a little bit of what makes me truly happy, and, if I'm really lucky, a path to turn that joy into a career.In finding my way north to Katahdin ,and hopefully the joy I spoke of, I want to be an inspiration or a rallying point for my family, friends, and anyone else who stumbles upon our journey. The goal here isn't to be able to brag about my accomplishments, but for others see what a normal guy like myself is capable of, thereby gaining inspiration to achieve their own lofty goals. I have no desire to be a motivational speaker or anything of the sort, but if even one person finds an inkling of joy as a result of my walking 2000 miles, the blogging portion of this journey will have been a success.",,Our Why,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556994,"Within the first few days at home, I was ready to go, to get to the trail. However, over the last week, time has gone by so fast, and it felt like we could have used more time. When a head cold put me in a fog, the tasks became harder, but we were in crunch time. Luckily, with two days to spare the cold broke, and it was all hands on deck to get us ready to go. Besides minor details of finalizing insurance and taxes, our main priority was readying our gear. ""Base weight"" of a pack is your pack with all your gear, no food or water. My pack base weight was 20lbs exactly, Kyle's was 24lbs, and Brock's was 21lbs. If we can keep food and water to around 10lbs, we can stay within our 30-35lbs that we trained with. As all hikers do, I am sure as time goes on we will find what we can and cannot do without and drop some ounces, or even pounds along the way. We also registered for our Great Smoky Mountains National Park Thru-hiking permit. This is one of three permits required for a Thru-hiking, and the only one that you must pre-register. It was exciting to hold the permit in our hands. It all became very real. We will enter the smoky mountains about two weeks into our hike, which will be a great milestone to look forward to. Today as we are in the car heading down to Georgia a few thoughts run through my mind. First, is to only look at each day. If we start to see our only goal as Katahdin, which is six months away, we could become overwhelmed and disheartened. By focusing on each day and the goal to reach our shelter each night, we can celebrate more, and maybe enjoy each smaller victory. Secondly, I am grateful for the out pouring of support from our friends, family, and, complete strangers. Thank you all for your well wishes, prayers, and words of encouragement. As we set out for the trail on Tuesday we will be joined by my dad Mark, my step-dad Brian, and my little brother Eli. My mom, Carol, will be our shuttle and trail angel. She will be seeing us off from the approach trail, and later in that day meeting us at the offical southern terminus, Springer Mountain. Mark and Brian, will be hiking the first 4.5 days with us getting off the trail at Neel Gap. From this point forward, the blog may look different daily. One day it may be bullet points of our day with highlights, others might include more details and stories. I hope you continue to follow along with our journey.

Total miles on AT 0.2An interesting thing about the Approach trail is that it is not actually counted into the total number of miles on the AT. So we did not officially see our first white blaze until we reached Mt Springer, and today, only hiked 0.2 miles on the offical AT.Started approach trail 3/21/2017 1000amAt the Amicalola Falls vistor center, Jordan's pack weighed 35lbs, Kyle's 34lbs, and Brock's 42lbs. The Approach trail starts with 600 stairs to the top of Amicalola Falls. Not an easy task. Our first day equalled 9.2 very tough miles. It seemed to keep climbing, with a few very steep sections. We all fared well, but we were tired by the time we made it to camp.  Eli made his departure and headed home with mom. She met us at the summit of Springer, and there we said our goodbyes. We made it into camp at 5:19pm. They say as soon as you get into camp you should get your tent set up; otherwise, you get too tired by the time you sit and cook your meal. Our waters were drained dry by the time we got into camp. Today was hot (80 degrees) which we were not expecting. It showed too as we only had long sleeves and long pants, and we were hot. So after a quick camp set up, we had to filter water in order to cook food. When searching for a water filter for the trip we chose a pump system, which we were told allows you to filter in very shallow water. I am so thankful we did. Our first water source we came across was no more than a trickle, and other systems were not able to filter. We were told the area has been in a drought since last summer, so we my find more water sources that have little flowing water. Dinner tasted so good. After hiking all day just about anything tastes amazing. Most of the meals that we packed for these first few days, included some sort of rice or pasta with chicken. Chicken, broccoli, and  rice was just what a group of hungry hikers needed. As we finished dinner it started to sprinkle. We quickly had to gather our food bags and scented items to hang on the bear cables, and get into our tents to keep dry. Now, the rain has stopped, but even though it's only 6:30, no one has emerged from their tents. I have even heard some snoring going on. We have threats of rain, that have now turned into flash flood warnings, and severe thunderstorms. The forecasts have said it will be short lived, but what a welcoming first night onto the AT. Prayers for safety over night as the storms loom overhead. Looking forward to day two and all that it will bring.","Amicalola Falls Visitors Center

The severe weather alerts and flash flood warnings were no joke. We made the rookie mistake of setting up our tent rather than going to shelter with threats of storms. As the rains came quickly the thunder and lighting came too. One bolt of lightening looked as though it hit right beside out tent. The flash was blinding, and the sound seemed as though it originated from inside our tent. It scared me so much I nearly jumped on Kyle's lap. Rookie mistake number two, not only did we set up our tent, but we set up slightly down hill. Within minutes of the the rain starting, we had puddles around our tent, and soon we had a water bed. We made the decision to jump ship and make a run for the shelter. Luckily there was space left for us. We woke up with completely wet gear, but the main thing was we were all safe. The rain brought with it cold weather and fog. Once we started hiking, we quickly warmed up. The sun came in pockets, and most of our day was spent in a rodadendra tunnel. The hike was mild, mostly a gradual down hill, with only slight elevation gain. We got into camp early which was a blessing, because we were able to hang our gear to dry before setting up camp. The evening was relaxing and even ended with a fire and a chance to meet fellow thru-hikers. The last 24 hours could only be described as small a roller coaster.

Today we were pushing to move ourselves up each mountain. Brock, I found, write letters in his head to Matthew Macconaughey. However, when you can get out of your own struggle for even just a few minutes, you might just find yourself at the top of a mountain. I would not say that our spirits were down today, but a little tired. When we were told there might be trail magic at Gooch Gap, I started praying for it. I thought a can a soda is just what our group needed. When we arrived to Gooch Gap, I was amazed. The trail angels were set up and upon arriving they told us sausage, potatoes, salad bar, and cobbler were on the menu. We had toyed with hiking further, but after we heard that we set up camp. Tonight, we had the chance to sit around the fire and meet other hikers and learn their stories. We even met a group of South Bound hikers, who started in Maine in August and September, hiking all through the winter. The sense of community is so appreciated, and helpful, like, when you miss key facts in your data book. Sitting around the campfire, hikers tend to discuss where everyone is planning to hike to the following day. When the conversation came up everyone said, we need to stop before Jasper Gap, or go all the way over Blood Mountain. Not only is it a huge jump in miles, but blood mountain is a huge climb, one we were not prepared to conquer tomorrow. So apparently we had missed in our book that between Jasper and over Blood you must have a bear canister to camp. We don't have them, and our original plan was to camp right in the middle of those two gaps. Our fellow through hikers saved our butts.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Our spirits were high, and even after pushing up Big Cedar Mountain, we were all feeling pretty good. At the same point we all reconvened and with the same ideas. We wanted to push over Blood Mountain and finish at Neel Gap. It was more miles than we had been doing by far, and it would include six summits, with Blood Mountain being the tallest of Georgia, on the AT. We pushed on with much motivation. With our car sitting at Neel, waiting for dad and Brian, it meant, showers, laundry, a real bed, and cheeseburgers. We met some more thru-hikers along the way, and said good bye to a few. We convinced a few other crazy hikers to do the big push with us to get to Neel Gap. The hike wore on us. Getting into town pushing seven, was close to our trail bed time. Showers and cheeseburgers were just what we needed. We had to do our laundry in the sink, and the water from our clothes was brown. The plan is to get back to the trail at a decent time tomorrow morning, and do 11.1 miles to a shelter, as we see rain in the next few day's forecast. In five days we should reach the town of Hiawassee, GA. There we have a care package waiting, and may even take our first true zero day.","Gooch Gap

Our destination for the night was Whitley Shelter, and right before our final climb, a group of trail angels appeared. We have been spoiled but today, pulled pork sandwiches were amazing.

Alan has quickly fit well with our group. It's crazy how much you get to know each other, when you hike for several hours together and when shelters are over filled at night, you get pretty close. Last night we had a couple firsts. There were mice in the shelter. We saw one, but heard them all night long. I had to put in earplugs and just close my eyes and pray I went to sleep before one walked on me. Another first, was waking up to our clothes that were still wet. The air is so hummid, so we stay constantly wet. Today starting at 1100am there was a chance rain that will last for about 24 hours. So, we opted for a shorter day and got to our shelter by 2pm. Although our day was short the miles were tough. It felt good to get into camp early, get off our feet,and clean up a little bit. We have just two days before we will take our first zero day. Our night in camp was filled with good company, lots of laughs, and pillow talk. Once you are on the trail, things that would have bothered you previously just don't seem like that big of deal. For instance sleeping shoulder to shoulder with strangers at night. We had a little rain, and there may have been mice, but it was my best night of sleep so far.","Blue Mountain Shelter

You just come to expect that every day you will be climbing. The miles came fast, and were over before I expected, but when it came time to set up camp I was tired. I don't know that my trail legs are quite under me yet, but each day the miles seem to come a little easier, and I make it farther than I imagine. Kyle's legs just seem to go. He is easily out in front of Brock and I, but he patiently let's us catch up, or let's us take lead and falls in behind us. It was a beautiful hiking day. Clear and sunny skies. We made it to a vista and we could finally see more than 10 feet. We made it out of camp with Alan, our new hiking partner. He had plans to make into the hostel tonight, and we decided to camp just outside of the hostel. Which means we had to say goodbye for now, in hopes we will catch him again soon. Tomorrow will be our first zero day, or technically, a nearly zero since we are hiking about one mile into the hostel. I am most excited for showers and clean laundry. Although, I know my body will appreciate it too. Mentally, I think we are all in a really good place. Each night, especially the last few, looking our from the shelters over the trees and the mountains, I can't help but smile, and give praise. The experience is beyond what I could have imagined. The trail is always changing, so even if the going is tough, just wait, it will change soon. From climbs, to gaps, to ridges, rodadendra forests, to road crossings, rocky, flat, foggy, sunny, rainy, it is always changing. It may be cliché to say but I find myself saying ""this too shall pass."" Yesterday, we were able to celebrate one week on the trail. I have come to find the small victories to embrace. Katahdin is so far away that we must find smaller goals to look forward to celebrating. Another victory we have coming up is crossing our first state line. We will be done with Georgia and on to North Carolina. Also, we are not far from having our first 100 miles under our belts. We are so blessed to be out here, from the scenery  around us, to sleeping and cooking under the stars, or sharing dinner, or your bed for that matter, with complete strangers, they are all moments that I hope stay with me forever.","Tray Mountain

It was real advice and somethings that were hard to hear, but necessary. We found out that we are around the 75% of hikers who are still hiking. Twenty-five percent of thru-hikers quit by Dick's Creek, but we are still going strong. Days after resupply are always difficult, because you have loaded your pack with days of food, and this morning my packed weighed 42 pounds. However, I decided from the beginning I can't let my pack weigh me down, literally or mentally. At least once a week we resupply so we can't afford to be grump once a week by the weight of our pack. Today might have been our hardest day yet. It was a constant up hill and each mountain seemed to be steeper than the last. We had 11.8 miles so we knew it was going to be a long day. It was one of our first days that we each hiked at our own pace. Alan (GQ) is a fast hiker, and Kyle, Brock, and I were leap frogging back in forth. We had our destination in mind and we just decided to we would see each other in camp. We all arrived within an hour of each other. Today we had a great accomplishment, we passed our first stateline we left Georgia and are now hiking in North Carolina. Bob, from the hostel said we are going from a level four in Georgia, and now that we are in North Carolina we are up to a level six.

We came down into a gap freezing, and I was sleepy, but Granny was serving a full hot breakfast and coffee. It feels like our trail legs are starting to come. Each day we feel a little stronger and the miles come a little easier. Up hills are still hard, and I think always will be, but they come easier, and we recover easier. It always amazes me how much more your body can give when you don't let the mental game win. There are times when I look at our climb in front of us and I think I don't possibly have it in me.

We have reservations in town on Tuesday, and our original plan was to hike 11.5 miles that day into town. However, if we can hike less miles and get there earlier in the day, it allows us more rest and time to do all that we need to do in town. So we pushed on.

We started with intentions of 14 miles, putting us within five miles of the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we would spend a near zero. However, the rain continued to dump on us and we were saturated. At one point I started laughing and Kyle asked what was so funny. I replied, "" I can't be mad. We are choosing to go through this, but it ridiculous, so I might as well laugh."" By the time you are soaking wet, your feet are soggy, and the rain just won't let up, you might as well splash in a few puddles and have some fun. By lunch time we were eight miles in, and the shelters were already filling with people staking claim for the day. We were soaked, and the idea of setting up wet tents, in the rain nonetheless, did not sound appealing. The idea of hiking nearly twenty miles and getting into the hostel seemed to be what needed to happen. So, at 1pm, we decided to push 11 more miles and make it to the hostel. We called ahead and reserved spots, and the deed was done. We started strong, even trail running at times. Also, as things usually go, as we left lunch the down pour seemed to increase and the winds picked up in force. Again, what can you do but laugh and jump in the puddles. With around five miles to go, we could see the center up from a vista, but it was just a tease because the last five miles were never ending. We winded around mountains, and even ascended in elevation when we knew we needed to go down another thousand feet or more. We were physically drained and came into camp with nothing left to give. We made it into the hostel complex and I was in a fog. I was unable to think of anything but sitting down, getting my shoes off and, of course, eating. It was cruel punishment that once we checked in, the highlighted path to our cabin felt days away. We even had to get back on the AT. We made it into the complex by 5:30pm and the restaurant closed at seven. So, before even showering, we headed straight for food.

I do have to take a minute and praise the outdoor center and their staff at Nantahala. Before even starting the trail, I have delt with my toes going numb after walking several miles. I knew I had proper fitting boots, and my toes weren't crunched or jammed. As you can imagine now, 130 miles in, I have been dealing with a lot of toe numbness and tingling. I have asked before about shoe inserts, but no one was ever able to give me clear answers as to whether or not they would help. Today, however, I started talking with an employee, and when he heard what I was dealing with quickly directed me to their foot guru, who just happened to be a former podiatrist: Tom. This man was able to look at my feet, boots, step and former insoles and tell exactly what was going on. From what he described, I was dealing with nerving pinching due to the fact that I am lacking a metatarsal arch. He custom made metatarsal arch supports and also set me up with a little more cushion in my insoles. Hopefully, this is an answer and the numbness and tingling will improve. Kyle also found he was dealing with some boot issues that were exacerbated after a 20 miles day. Tom also took plenty of time helping Kyle pick a boot that was best for his foot.

So we set out in our dry shirt and a pair of paper thin rain pants. Thankfully when we set out it was snowing rather than raining. The snow created a beautiful scenery to hike through. The weather forecast was projecting rain around 2pm. Getting wet was a risk, so when we made it to the first shelter by 1pm, we decided to hole up in the shelter. It was cold and miserable. It was hard to get and stay warm. Many hikers didn't even leave the shelter today in hopes of staying dry and warm. These past two days were hard and I am sure many hikers ask themselves why they are putting themselves through days like this. I know I did.

It's humbling to see how the hiker community helps one another and learns from one another. For example, hikers sharing rooms and dinner tables with someone they just met. We met a couple who has been resupplying by orders from amazon prime, so we are trying it out. Going into a small resupply camp stores, prices can be marked up drastically. Our plan is to resupply in Gatlinburg half way through the Smokys, so we sent an amazon package there. The rest of today is filled with resting and logistics. We all had the feeling that we needed to be on the move, to be doing something. I had to remind myself it was OK to relax and to enjoy the time. It was a beautiful day and the patio of the lodge looked out over the Smokys, which made it even harder to sit.

If you remember back at Nantahala, he met with Tom, the foot guy, and he was informed his boots had seen better days and he was in need of a new pair. The next morning, one of the eyelets for his laces broke. He was a trooper and hiked the 30 miles from Nantahala to Fontana with his busted boots. He is enjoying his new boots and using the time today to break them in. GQ likes to call them his hot boots! We tried as best we coud through spotty wifi calling to make plans for meeting Kyle's parents. As soon as we leave the Smokys, we will be in the Asheville area where we are looking forward to spending time with Shawn and Nikki.","Fontana Village

The weather today was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky, and we could see for miles. Kyle kept saying he just felt like he was on a long section hike, and wondered when it would change. When would it feel like a thru-hike? Today he said, ""I finally feel like we are Thru-hiking."" I think part of it has to do with the fact that the Smokys are a huge milestone of the south, and also something hikers talk about from day one. Another official feeling has to do with the permit thru-hikers need. A thru-hiker has to have a permit to enter the Smokys, limiting the areas for camping, and also the amount of days spent in the park. Looking forward to today in the guidebook, there is an intimidating 11 miles of climbing, a 3000+ foot elevation gain. Part of it is just the mental battle. Because we were prepared for it, it didn't feel too bad. The rumors of shelters have been fluttering for weeks. We were told rangers regulated each shelter, and that there was no camping allowed at the shelters, so if the shelter was full you had to continue hiking on to the next shelter. So far, none of that has been true. It's funny how the stories get passed down the grapevine.","Fontana Village

My eyes felt so heavy, and all I wanted to do was take a nap. We passed the six mile mark quickly, and we were starting to think about lunch. Right then the trail started climbing and continued to climb. I was feeling low energy, and frankly getting hangry. As we were climbing there wasn't much of an opportunity to stop along there trail and eat. We made it to the top of Rocky Top Mountain, and it opened up to beautiful views, and plenty of rocks to lounge on. It was a perfect lunch spot. The up hills just continued coming and each lead into a steep downhill. I was feeling drained coming into camp and felt alone in that until every hiker that came into camp said, ""today was tough!"" We had an interesting first time experience tonight as well. In the Smokys, section hikers have priority in the shelters. They aren't even allowed to camp. Hiker midnight was almost upon us as hikers were headed into the shelter, some already in their sleeping bags, and in walked five section hikers. The already full shelter had to make adjustments. It's a first come first serve basis, so the last in are the first out. Luckily, the three of us were the first three in, but it was difficult to watch your fellow thru-hikers get kicked out so late in the evening and have to set up tents.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Not only because physically you aren't demanding as much from your body, but the whole day has a different feel. We slept in, and didn't get out from our sleeping bags until almost everyone left camp. We took out time, slowed down, and enjoyed our surroundings. We stopped for lunch at one of the shelters and another thru-hiker doing the same miles, said ""this is a luxury."" Our boots were off and we lounged in the sun. Most days lunch is a quick eat and continue on, sometimes due to cold weather, other times long mile days don't afford many breaks. For those of us who did do shorter miles today, our spirits were lifted after our more difficult day yesterday. Today while I was hiking, I was reminded of how happy I am to be where I am, and who I am with. This morning as we were about to leave camp, a very vocal fight broke out between two hiking partners. It's hard to see two people go through that, and you know that out here it's easy to have hard days. A section hiker at the shelter witnessing it said, "" Isn't a litte early on to be having a breakdown?"" Statistically, however, 25% of thru-hikers have already quit, and another 25% will quit within the next 70 miles. So no, it's not too early. Many have already thrown in the towel, and I am thankful to still be here, seeing and experiencing the trail. As things go on the trail, the topic of the fighting couple came up a couple of times. An overwhelming amount of people, even those married for 30 plus years, will say they could never hike with their spouse. For me, there is no one I would rather be hiking with. If anything I have learned to respect and appreciate Kyle more since we have been hiking. The little things do speak volumes out here, especially after a long day. I am not saying things are perfect all the time, and that our communication never fails, but I know at the end of the day we have each other's backs, and want the best for each other. Even with Brock, I am thankful for his company as well. Friendships can be strained on the trail, we have seen it happen.

It was such a treat to see them and share or journey with them. We continued forward through the day slack packing, meaning we left our packs in Cheryl and Phil's car while we hiked. We climbed up to the observation deck where we saw 360 degree views into Tennessee and North Carolina. We  were able to look back over some of the places we have come from, and at so far away, it really gives a sense of accomplishment. We walked with Cheryl and Phil, for a few miles north on the AT, and they were able to celebrate another victory with us, crossing our 200 mile mark. We continued on while they turned back towards the car and we met them again at Newfound Gap. From there they spoiled us yet again and drove us into Gatlinburg, helped us pick up our packages and had dinner with us. They also supplied us with a great care package.

The day started out great, the first person we asked for a ride back to Newfound Gap was happy to take us. We made it back to the trail in great time, then Kyle realized his phone fell out of his pocket in the van we hitched a ride. Luckily the guy told us where he was headed after he dropped us off. Kyle scanned the parking lot for anyone willing to give him a ride, and that just happened to be on the back of a motorcycle. Kyle found the van, phone inside, but no driver in sight. So Kyle headed, well jogged rather, up the mountain after the guy. He finally caught up to him about 2 miles in. Luckily, Justin, who gave us the ride, is a nice guy and said "" I just think about how I would want to be treated."" So Justin and Kyle walked back down from the mountain chatting and getting to know each other. Justin found our story of hiking the trail to be interesting enough before he got chased down by the hiker he gave a ride, but afterwards he thought our story today needed to be told. So he did a short youtube video for his channel. If you are interested in following Justin, you can find him at Cosplayincorporated on Facebook. Justin, went even further and gave Kyle a ride back to the parking lot where I was waiting, and he gave us some homemade breads. We were beyond thankful for Justin's help today, not once, but multiple times.  The rest of the day went on without much difficulty. We had 10.3 miles, and Brock had headed on, about two hours ahead of us, by the time we got back on the trail. The walking today was beautiful. We walked along a narrow ridge with views on both sides. We passed some fellow hikers along the way, and we stopped to tell them our story of the morning, and they all said, ""you will surely get a trail name out of that one."" However, a clever name has not come up yet. We made it into camp, and it was crowded. The bear cables, where we hang our food at night, was over filled. We have hung our own bag in a tree several times, without hiccup, but tonight it went wrong. When Kyle threw the rock with line attached to it over the tree, instead of falling to the ground, it swung over the branch about 5 times, wrapping itself around the limb. The branch was too high to climb, but we didn't have enough rope to cut it. We tried several methods including trying to get Kyle up on Brock's shoulders, but nothing was working. We started to have an audience. Kyle came up with the idea of throwing a rock tied the opposite end of the rope back over the branch several times until the rope was free. Brock and I weren't seeing it but Kathy, a fellow hiker, said,  ""I think that will work,"" and sure enough it did. Kyle freed the rope. Afterwards, Kathy says to us, ""you have had quite the day, but you are still able to laugh about it."" I loved hearing that, and I hope we can continue to be that way. Kyle and I, have worked really hard to learn to let things roll off us, and secondly understanding that your reaction can make a huge difference in your situation. Brock asked me today, will this be Kyle's worst day on the trail, and I told him ""I think he will be OK, it's disappointing sure, but I have seen him overcome worse with a great attitude.""

They found us at the Gap, and were acquainted with hiker life real quick. First, the stinch, I feel sorry for their truck. Second, how much we eat, they bought us six candy bars, I don't think they fully intended to be devoured as soon as we got in the truck, but that is exactly what happened. Third, they earned trail angel status by giving a ride to a couple hikers to the nearest general store. Fourth, not only the stinch, but the filth.

Shawn and Nikki's home is still being built, so we have spent the last few days on the property in their camper. Shawn and Nikki graciously gave us the camper while they set up a tent. Even though we said we clearly didn't mind, they insisted. Nikki fed our stomachs and souls. she made us an amazing Easter dinner of chicken noodles, mashed potatoes, and rolls.The boys had a man date and went to a movie, while I spent the day drinking milkshakes with Shawn and Nikki. It was fun to have a little bit of normalcy just running around town, going out to eat, watching TV shows, and being with the family. We also made it to REI. We have had some issues with our Katadyn Hiker Pro water filter. The filter become very difficult to pump when the filter needs cleaning, and before we learned how to properly clean it, I, yes I need to clarify I, broke the filter handle. The guys like to refer to me as hulk hands due to this, and like to remind me at any chance that I was the one who broke it. So, for the last week, our handle has been held on with Krazy Glue, working, but I wouldn't call it reliable. Luckily we were able to exchange the filter at REI. Brock also took the opportunity to look at new shoe options. He has been dealing with some achilles pain from his boots digging into that area. He was able to find a hiking shoe that will keep pressure off that area. Hopefully over the next day he will get the chance to test them out and see if they will be a good option moving forward. That makes two of us now that have had made mid trail shoe changes, and from what we have gathered, is more common than you might think. In most cases, a hiker will go through multiple pairs of boot over the course of their through hike. We are preparing to slack pack tomorrow and get big miles in. The push is for 21.4 miles.

You may notice that our starting and ending location seem a little out of sorts. On a whim we decided while slack packing that rather than starting at Davenport, we would start at Lemon and hike south. It ended up working well in our favor, because the climb out of Davenport is a beast. It was crazy hiking against the Northbound hiker flow. We passed 126 hikers in our 21 miles, and it felt busy. Of those hikers we saw several that we hadn't seen in a couple days to a couple weeks. We got a few crazy looks from the hikers we knew. We frequently heard things like, ""You know you're headed the wrong way right?"" The miles came fairly easy, however, Kyle dealt with ankle pain and knee pain. He was a trooper, slowing down, but a great attitude through it all. With 2 miles left, we passed under US 40 as Shawn and Nikki had just gotten off 40 and pulled up right behind us. It was so tempting to just jump in the truck right then and skip the last two miles. We pushed on though and made it the last little bit. Shawn and Nikki jumped on the trail for a short bit, and Shawn must have got the hiker hunger. For dinner that night he ate four pieces of pizza.

By this point you have dealt with the AT in all conditions, have had aches and pains, and the novelty has started to wear off.

We climbed along the French Broad River. The vistas were beautiful over looking the river down into the valley of Hot Springs. The humidity today had to be 100% because sweat was just pouring from me. Getting into camp early allowed us to hang a line, dry out some clothes, and take a zip lock bag bath.

One thing I have started thinking about it is that I have hiked and camped near people for multiple days, and I don't know their name, or their story. There are nights you get into camp and get to know the person that cooks next to you or sleeps near you. Then there might be someone who you pass during the day, and then they show up in your same camp. The next day the same happens, and then the next day, and you realize you know them, you exchange pleasantries, but you don't know their name. I was convicted of this over the last couple days. First, a trail angel we met was waiting on her daughter at a road crossing. She told us her name but we didn't recognize her by name. Later that day, however, we realized her daughter is a girl we have camped near several times and have eaten dinner next to. Then today we passed an older couple that we have seen off and on since our first week, and finally today after this conviction, I asked their names, and learned a little about them. We have met so many people, and have relationships with them that leave us longing to catch up or see them again. This time in our lives is so unique, that we daily have our lives intersected with new people, that we literally share life with each day. It's a time that I don't want to look back on with regret. It's easy at the end of a long daily to hide away in the solitude of your tent, but part of this trail is sharing in each others' journey, and that is something I don't want to miss. The hike today gave several challenging climbs. We made great time for most of the day. The threat of rain was over head, with the greatest chance to hit between two and three. We made it up to a ridge line, and at a Y intersection, the sign said, ""Bad Weather By Pass."" Logically, with active thunder overhead, one might think ""Let's take the bypass,"" but we decided to take the exposed ridge trail. It all sounds very dramatic, but  everything turned out fine. We did get hit with a down pour while on the ridge line. We made it to an over hang in one of the rocks and put on our rain gear. Just as we did, the rain stopped. That seems about how it goes, if you want it to stop raining simply put on your rain gear. We made it to camp and each night I am surprised by how many people are in camp. It seems as though the groups are getting bigger rather than thinning out. Our victory today was the 300 mile mark.

Back on night one we had to abandon our tent due to a river of water flowing under our tent, but last night that wasn't an option. There was some heavy rain, small hail, thunder and lighting, but we stayed dry. Before falling asleep, while I was reading, I forgot where I was. I forgot that I was out on the trail in our tent. It seemed so comfortable, almost like home, even in the middle of the storm. As we prepaired to leave camp this morning, fellow thru-hiker Loki, said, ""Today we embrace the suck."" That's exactly what we did, embraced the suck. The plan for the day was to hike into a campsite 11 miles from town. We were in the predicament that the first shelter was 10 miles, which left about 16 miles into town, or the following shelter was 20 miles, more than we were wanting to tackle. So, a campsite, not ideal for a rainy night. Three miles into the day we come upon Glampress and Torque, two ladies who we have come to know and frequently hike and camp with, and they were sitting at an underpass waiting for a shuttle. Glampress, who got her name because she is the queen of getting to a warm bed and out the cold, had concerns that with the rain and the dropping temperature, that staying out over night wasn't the safest idea. We didn't take them up on a hitch into town at that point, but our group quickly decided we weren't staying out in the cold tonight either. Spivy Gap was 0.5 miles past our intended campsite and there would be road access. The decision was made, we just had to get there. GQ had visions of sipping wine in bed. I desperately wanted dry clothes and blankets. We all had our driving force getting us to Spivy. As we climbed in elevation the temperature dropped, but we also became exposed to the wind. The weather was forecasting winds 30-50 MPH. When we reached the top of Big Bald, I could see the rain tearing across the bald with the wind. We were so cold, we were exposed, and the only relief was going to be getting to town. We stopped at the 10 mile shelter for a quick lunch break, but my hands had lost all dexterity and I could hardly eat my food. Kyle  tried to put on another layer, but he was shaking so badly from the cold he could hardly buckle his pack. Getting down off the bald and back into the woods did help some, but we were soaked. When we finally made it to the road, luckily Verizon service had 1 bar. We got the call out to the shuttle through broken service and within the half hour he was there to pick us up. Tom, the shuttle driver, was surprised to hear we got the call out from the road, he said no one ever has service there. We made our way into Erwin, TN and pulled into the Super 8 where we claimed the last room avaliable. As he was processing our payment, someone called looking for a room, and he told them ""I just sold the last room."" Some call it Karma, I call it blessed. Only after a hot shower was I able to stop shivering. The Super 8 was filled with hikers. It took me back to my college days when everyone would leave their dorm rooms open and everyone would catch up in the hall ways. The first floor was filled with hikers waiting for laundry to finish, sharing food, and swapping stories. The community of hikers is truly something amazing to witness. You spend so much time side by side with these people, sharing in tough times and celebrating the victories. You look out for one another and become like family in some ways.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

It's funny to think that now a 12 mile day seems short. Another day filled with fog and no views from the vistas; however, we did stay dry and, if we kept moving, stayed warm. For that, I am thankful. All was going well, and we came upon this campsite that appeared to be the one we were searching for. Although, three different sources of guide material had conflicting information. We thought we still had just over a mile to the campsite, which should have been all down hill. What was ahead of us, however, was all uphill. The concern with moving forward was, if the campsite did not exist forward, there was no water. Brock continued forward, but after more discussion, Kyle, GQ, and I decided to head back to the campsite. Kyle dropped his pack and went on a chase after Brock. GQ, stayed with me and carried his own pack and Kyle's pack back the quarter mile to the campsite. After Kyle caught up with Brock, they explored on a litte further and found that there was no campsite or water within two miles north. As we made it to the campsite, we were welcomed by those who knew our plans were to stop there. Many had the same confusion with their guides, and we also informed others heading forward of what we had learned. It's a crazy little site tucked right next to the road.

We embraced the sun today. We tried thinking back to the last day we had that was clear, and it may have been in the Smokys. Our breaks lasted a little longer as we enjoyed the sun over head. These past few days I have been reminded of the importance of taking zero days. After staying in Erwin, it was easy to trick ourselves into think we had rested. Although we did rest, we still pushed miles. It has been 9 days and almost 150 miles since we last zeroed.  In that time we have increased our miles, and pushed a quick pace. We are still making bigger miles, and without much difficulty. However, over the last few days I felt more fatigued, and my body just feels tired getting into camp. My feet are also aware of the miles as they feel tender and bruised. We will remedy this soon as we have a zero planned in just 2 days. 
I love the days we make it into camp early. We usually eat dinner somewhere between five and six, so on days we get in around three, we really get some relaxation in. Some days it consists of a nap, others just lounging and eating. I tried out some yoga in hopes of easing my tired body. Each day I get into camp it is as if rigamortise sets in and each time you move, it's followed with a series of grunts and hobbling. Stretching is something I have tried to convince myself to do time and time again, but each day coming into camp exhausted it has been hard to motivate myself to do so. Today as I worked through the movements, I could feel how tight my muscles are, and how badly they needed to stretch. Maybe this will spur me on to more of a common practice in taking care of these muscle that are working so hard.","Deep Gap

Today I cried for the first time on the AT. I didn't cry because it was hard, or I hurt, or that the weather had turned bad again. I cried because Kyle and I weren't the team we needed to be that day. As I have mentioned in earlier posts, we were feeling fatigued, we have pushed 150 miles with no zeros, and our bodies were feeling it. The morning had been smooth, but my pace was suffering. As I tire, it's harder for me to keep pace with the guys. We started the climb to the top of Roan Mountain with plans to meet for lunch at the top. I started to fall behind in pace and Kyle stayed back with me. We get to the top and I am starving, but no GQ or Brock, so we continue forward. Now Roan Mountain is tricky. It has a false summit, so what we thought had been the summit actually wasn't and we climbed further, still no GQ or Brock. Roan Mountain is also known to be the coldest place on the AT in the south and it was showing its true colors. With winds tearing across the top of the mountain and white out fog, we couldn't see more than 10 feet. We search the mountain top, the parking lot, the campsites, and head to the shelter, no GQ and no Brock. By this point I am frustrated, but more than anything hangry. At this point we leave the mountain top thinking that maybe they went down to avoid the weather at the gap that was 1.5 miles ahead. To this point Kyle and I were solid, he pep talked me down the mountain, and prepared me for what was to come. More uphill and weather that was supposed to take a turn for the worse. He said ""I want you to be prepared, I've got you now but I may need you later."" I knew my attitude needed a change. As we approach the gap however, I rashly make a hurtful comment, and we snapped at each other. Even more upset we make it to the gap, still no GQ and no Brock, and the weather is turning for the worst. Hungry, mad, and cold we don't want to stop to eat. We were 6 miles from the shelter and we hiked forward frustrated and in silence. This is where I started to cry. As the winds were picking up, we were exposed on the top of a bald, and the fog was heavy. I was falling behind and started loosing visual on Kyle. I cried. I was so upset with myself and that my attitude kept me from being the partner Kyle needed in that moment. I knew how miserable he was because I felt it too, but because we were both hurt, we weren't able to lift each other up in that time of need. Two miles out from our shelter we stopped and had a little heart to heart, and we were able to move forward again as a team. We were still frustrated and ready to give the guys some crap for ditching us, but when we got into camp, no GQ and no Brock. Then we started to worry, they should have been way ahead of us and we hadn't seen them for over 13 miles. About 20 minutes later they rolled in. Relieved, we asked ""Where were you guys?"" Apparently, it all came down to a miscommunication. We thought we were to meet at the top of the mountain, and they thought we were to meet at the Gap. So they continued forward to the gap, but as we approached the gap the fog was so dense that we couldn't see each other. We all made it where we needed to be safe and sound, and that's what mattered. After what for Kyle and I was a more emotional day, we took shelter in an old barn that was donated to the AT as a shelter. Unknown to us, it is a frequent spot for trail magic, and two military men, packed in beers, hot dogs, and sausages. It not only lifted our spirits, but many others as well. I have never seen hikers move so fast, as when they called out ""Come get your hot dogs."" We stayed up late, and gathered around the campfire and sharing stories with our tramily.","Clyde Smith Shelter

The guys have taken over most of the planning, and I love it! I wake up each day and ask how far we are going, and I start hiking. The only time it gets me is when I don't look at the elevation profile and I miss that there is a giant climb in our day. Today, although we climbed a lot, it might be my favorite day so far. We spent around 5 miles climbing over balds that had 360 degree views. Bald are mountains with no trees at the top, picture a rolling grass covered hills, but thounds of feet high. The weather was perfect, and most of us took our time and relaxed once we reached the top. It was so different from most of the other scenery we have seen so far, it almost seemed foreign. 
The rest of the day we spent hiking down to TN 19, where we would get off the trail for the next couple of days. There is a hostel and B&B, Mountain Harbor, that is know for its breakfast. A week ago we heard of this breakfast and have been dreaming of it since. We made it to the hostel, and actually set up our tents. Rather than paying for rooms, we decided to zero in out tents. Paying for the campsite, which is cheaper than the room, allowed us full access to the hostel and B&B. The showers were hot, the laundry was done, and we were happy hikers. The hostel did stop offering shuttles to town, so the food choices were limited on site. So we had to resort to hitching. Kyle, Brock, and Torque, left for a beer run and couldn't catch a hitch the whole two miles there. On the way back however, if you place cases of beer along side the road, and stick out your thumb, people are far more willing to pick you up. For dinner we heard rumors of milk shakes 3 miles from the hostel. Torque, Kyle, and I hitched into town in the second car that passed. The young lady who picked us up said she picks up hikers all the time. Bob's Dairyland did grace us with milk shakes, 32 ounce milkshakes at that. A peanut butter chocolate shake was my dinner tonight.  Catching a ride back wasn't too difficult either, the old man gave the guys a hard time, saying ""No boys allowed."" I just nervously laughed and pushed Kyle into the car. He was a nice old fellow who has lived in or around this small town his whole life. Tomorrow we zero at this great little retreat. Plans are already being made, naps, soaking our aching feet in the creek, more milkshakes, famous breakfast, and recovering from these last 150 miles.","Overmountain Shelter

Breakfast was beyond words. The woman who prepares breakfast wakes up each morning at 4 am to start her preparations. Everything is made from scratch and the spread is huge. Blueberry pancakes, eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, homestyle potatoes, hasbrown casserole, breads, muffins, pastries, cookies, and fresh fruits. She even had a coffee, tea, hot cocoa bar with all types of flavoring and creamers. This breakfast made my day. We even snagged the big dinning room table so we were surrounded by our tramily. We were truly blessed! For those of you who know Kyle and my story, you're aware we have been traveling with my job for the last 2 years.

As far as hiking days go, today was a lazy Sunday. Although we did 16 miles, everything about today was relaxed. The terrain was easy, the pace was slow, and we breaked often. After lunch we hadn't made it a mile when we came upon trail magic. It was a 13 year old boy, goes by Powder, and he was grilling burgers and hotdogs. Powder, his dad, and little brother all attempted a thru hike in 2016, but a foot injury took them off the trail half way through. He asked his dad if they could do trail magic, and we were lucky enough to run into them. Being a hiker himself, he knew exactly what we like. He had lawn chairs out and the next thing I knew we had been there an hour. A few good ol' boys, no teeth, and straight redneck, came racing down the forest road on their four wheelers, beers raised high as they sped past. They came back a few minutes later asking what we were doing, and asking about hiking the AT.  One of the guys asked for hot dog, and Powder says, "" How about I trade you three hotdogs, for four beers for these hikers here?"" The kid was 13 and scored us beer. 
We are now 400 milers. Each hundred mile mark is such an accomplishment, but now I really can feel and see the progress. Looking through our guide book at the map, we are no longer a hash mark. We can see that we have covered significant distance. 
I have also started to notice the leaves on the trees around the trail. It seemed for a few weeks that the trees around the trail, and down in the valleys were starting to see green, but never on the trees right around the trail. Now our tunnels are getting greener, and almost over night the trees are filling with leaves. 
Today we also saw our first significant snake. It was right on the trail as I approached it. I nearly jumped on Kyle. We watched the snake for several minutes as it made its way off the trail and into a tree. It was all black with a white underside, and about 3 feet long. Brock thought it might be a King snake, because it was climbing a tree. 
We struggled a little finding the campsite again tonight as the guides had conflicting distances. This campsite is worth the hike. Although it's right on the trail, it quiet and tucked away. The water source is just around the corner so from our tent we can listen to nature's soundtrack of the birds and the stream. Thanks to Glampress and Torque, we have a great little tent spot. GQ is behind us today, but he plans to catch up tomorrow as we head into Black Bear Resort for a resupply, and maybe some slack packing.","Us 19/ Mountain Harbor

When slack packing, it's amazing how easily the miles come. We had 13 miles planned, and we were able to knock it out in no time. There was an intimidating climb that, on paper, looked like a challenge, but after reaching the top we were shocked to find it was behind us. Today's scenery was quite different than any other day. We passed the tallest water fall of the AT, Laurel Falls, and we meandered through rock gorges. With today's weather and no weight on my back, I wanted to keep going and push bigger miles. However, due to road access, it was 13 or 30, and 30 was out of the question. 
When we got back to Black Bear, we were the only ones in camp. With great weather everyone pushed forward. We enjoyed movie night at the hostel lounge room. It's small luxuries like sitting on a couch with friends, watching movies, and eating popcorn, that we hikers can really appreciate. Out on the trail we are lucky to have a log to sit on, so a sitting surface with a back and some cushion is a definite comfort.","Dennis Cove

Before getting a shuttle back to the trail head, the driver said, ""Have you looked at the forecast?"" We had, but the more we discussed it the more I thought, I don't enjoy being out in the rain and cold. We had three days planned until Damascus, and the last two were projecting rain, a drop in temps, and crazy winds. We all decided we were fine to move forward. We would take it as the trail dealt it. As we got on the trail today, it was a beautiful day with sun, mild temps, no rain, and no wind. We only had 11 miles planned and I was struggling with stopping so early. We discussed with Brock and GQ the option of pushing forward. Kyle and I figured we could split it into two big mile days of 18 and 18, or do 3 days with a very short mileage day on the third day. Brock and GQ weren't feeling it, so Kyle and I had a decision to make. There is a saying on the AT, ""Hike your own hike."" It's one that has many different meanings, one being ""mind your own business."" Another and more accurate meaning, hike the hike your own way, the way that makes you happy. For Kyle and I, we had to make the decision to hike our own hike today. I dreaded the thought of getting caught in the rain, and stopping short on such a beautiful day. We spent the time talking it over with Brock and GQ, and they were OK with us pushing forward if that's what we wanted. So after they stopped for the day, we pushed forward and did another 11.5 miles, leaving us with only 15 miles until Damascus. I struggled so much with leaving the guys. I went full momma bear, making sure they had all their gear and making sure they didn't feel abandoned. I knew for my sanity I needed to hike on, but leaving them was difficult. For those who don't know me, I am a people pleaser. I usually put a lot of thought and, frankly, worry into others feelings. 
It was a full day, we hiked until sundown, 22.5 miles. We stopped at a shelter at 18 miles with thoughts that we may move forward. After a quick Snickers break, we decided to move ahead. A twenty-two and fifteen break down sounded more desirable than eighteen and eighteen. By the end of our day my feet ached. Usually my muscles are fine, my joints do ok, but my feet are my weakness. I struggled with sleep, although I was exhausted. Between soreness, sleeping near a road (which sketches me out), and rumors of bears in the area, I was restless.","Wilbur Dam Road

We got through the day without rain, but they were correct about the wind predictions. The wind was fierce, and a little scary. While hiking we could hear limbs and branches crashing to the ground all around us. The trees creaked and moaned as we ran past them praying. Thankfully, although windy, it wasn't too cold. With my feet still aching from our previous day, I felt slow. However, we kept a fast pace, three miles an hour. The trail actually travels through the downtown of Damascus. It has the reputation of being a trail friendly community. We got into town with no reservations because we got in a day earlier than intended, but we heard tales of The Place. It's a bunk house run by the local church. Simple, very basic accommodations, but clean, and only seven dollars. Thirty people shared one shower, the rules were strict and enforced, but it was a roof over our head and I was thankful. As we were just getting into town we heard, ""Cool kids!!"" Glampress and Torque had made it into town earlier and they spotted us. Glampress wouldn't let Torque make plans of moving forward without talking to our crew, making sure we don't separate the tramily. We joined them for dinner before heading back to The Place for bed.","US 421

Today we zeroed. By 7:30, the care taker at The Place was coming into our bunk room saying, ""Wow, you all are really sleeping in. You only have two hours to get ready before checkout."" Our 10am breakfast plans got bumped up to 8 because now we were awake. For hikers, it takes all of 10 minutes to dawn your one outfit and stuff all of your 10 belongings into your backpack. The two breakfast items I have been craving this past week, Blueberry pancakes and a bagel and lox, they had on the menu. Thankful for hiker hunger, naturally I ordered both. I did end up having to share both of them because it was a lot of food, but it was just as delicious as I had hoped for. Brock and GQ made amazing time, they were in town  by 10:30, and met us for the tail end of breakfast. 
The town of Damascus consists of restaurants and outfitters. Not only is the town known for the AT, but the Virgina Creeper bike trail. So we food and gear hopped most of the day. We of course couldn't let the day end without celebrating Cinco de Mayo at the only Mexican restaurant in town. The restaurant however was out of patron, on Cinco de Mayo....

It was a perfect day for a zero. The weather turned cold and it drizzled all day. We have had some poor timing in the past of zeroing on nice days and heading out of town in the rain. Not today, I enjoyed my day from the comfort of the couch, snuggled up in a blanket, drinking multiple cups of coffee, and reading a book. The Hikers Inn is an old home they converted into a hostel. However, there are only 3 rooms in the home, and our tramily occupied all of them. Everything is done up just perfectly. They don't stock there home wuth low quality items just because it's a bunch of dirty hikers using it. The lines were soft, the beds felt like clouds, the bath towels were plush, and the bathroom was filled with shower supplies that left you feeling cleaning and smelling great. Lee and Paul the owners of the Inn are amazing people. Paul thru-hiked in 2010, and is a wealth of information, especially when is come to coffee shops along the trail. Lee, is such an amazing caretaker meeting your every need with a smile. She was also helpful with suggestions around town. It felt like home, the comfort you can't get from a hotel room hostel. The Hikers Inn is a place I hope to return to in thr future.
We had a great meeting of the minds to plan out next segment of the trail. The way this usually goes is we look over the book, jot down some mileage, and then ask Glampress and Torque what they are doing, and we do the same. Now Glampress and Torque have been pushing some big miles, but we have great motivation to push the miles with them. They have friends coming into town who are slack packing them all next week, and if we are there with them, we get to slack pack as well. 
The last task of town was to switch to a summer wardrobe. Damascus had 3 outfitters in town, and I was able to find the few pieces I need to complete my summer attire. Now we did send some winter gear home, however, most experienced hikers of this area will tell you to keep your warm gear through the Grayson Highlands. Right before the Highlands, you summit the last 5000ft mountain until your get further north into New Hampshire. Within this week of leaving town we will have passed the Highland. Our weather this week has had a bit of a cooler snap, so we will be thankful to have held onto some warmer clothes.","

Now for any AT purists out there, you may want to shield your eyes. The Virgina Creeper Trail, is an old railway converted to a multi use trail. It a popular biking path stretching 33 miles. It also happens to be part of the original AT, and now sections of the current AT take the path as well. The Creeper trail parallels, joins, zigzags the AT several times throughout this section. Well today, GQ, Kyle, and I, decided to walk the Creeper trail most of the way rather than the AT. It offered a little change in pace and scenery. However, the greatest surprise was that half way into the day there was a cafe, where we had hamburgers, fries, and a chocolate milkshake. A sign posted said ""World Famous Chocolate Cake."" So, we figured we better not miss our on that so we packed out a piece to have with dinner at the shelter. 
When I tell the AT purists to shield their eyes, it is because today although our mileage was the same, and we were walking, it not following the white blazes. It's a personal decision and something each hiker has to come to their own comfort level with. Although I don't agree with skipping sections by other means than walk, such as, in a car, canoe, bike, etc, I do feel comfortable with taking a side trail every now and then.","Damascus

Today is a day I have been looking forward to. Today we entered the Grayson Highlands, home of the wild ponies. It is also a highlight of many previous hikers. In the Highland we were exposed to a lot of wind, which made it a little chilly, but we had a cloudless day with sunshine. Today we also passed our 500 mile mark, putting us close to a quarter of the way through the trail. 
So let's talk about these wild ponies. In the Grayson Highlands they graze all over the hill sides. Our first encounter we came upon just three of them and a foul. They are friendly and used to human interaction, so while taking their pictures, one came up and started licking Kyle. They like the taste of salt, and dirty, sweaty hikers have plenty of that. The others got jealous and the next thing I knew we were surrounded and being licked. The foul even came over to join in on it, and the momma horse didn't mind a bit that we were loving on her baby. The foul's little body was so disproportionate, with long legs, and a small body. As we traveled further we went past a few more clusters of ponies, all just as friendly. 
The Highlands are beautiful. With not much forest coverage, you can see for miles. The most difficult part of the day was the rocky terrain. We had some rock scrambles, but mostly rocks of all shapes and sizes scattered on the path. This is the type of terrain that really slows your pace, as you take care with each step.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Two miles short of our original 18 mile plan was a gap that offered one thing, a church hostel. Our day started in the rain and once the rain starts, it's really not motivating to set up camp at night. The rain started heavy, and the trail was flowing. In many areas we were jumping rock to rock in hopes of not completely submerging our feet. The rain lessened throughout the day, but the day was long and we were soggy. We made it to the gap, where rides were supposed to be easy to hitch. The first car we thumbed stopped for us, but because there were six of us we wouldn't all fit. We sent GQ, Glampress and Torque ahead, and we proceeded for the next 45 minutes to get another ride. Finally the pastor of the church, where the hostel was at, stopped and gave us a ride. Being a church, donation based hostel, I wasn't sure what to expect. They knew hikers, and catered to our needs and wants. The first thing we saw after walking in the door was a coffee pot and started brewing. The shower was hot, towels provided, and all kinds of different soaps. Kyle and I shared the bunk house with two men who snored so loud and so ferociously that they shook the bunks. The ear plugs couldn't even keep the sounds out.

It's been awhile since I have looked at a weather forecast, and with little to no service it's hard to check the next days forecast. After the rain yesterday, I didn't expect much from today's weather. However, it turned out to be a beautiful day with perfect hiking temperature. With just under 13 miles, we set out today relaxed and we kept that attitude most of the day. Stopping for breaks, hiking slow, listening to music, and we still made it to camp around two. The shelter sat just a tenth of a mile from the Mt Rogers Visitors Center which offered a phone and numbers for local pizza delivery. We order 3 pizzas and salads to eat in camp and enjoyed them by campfire. 
A development this week is Brock and I have earned trail names. Brock, due to his love of Chardonay, a few good stories that involved said Chardonay, and Torque when resupplying always buys Brock Chardonay, is now Chardonay or Chardonaynay. His name has been a trail favorite. My name, Aspirations, is two fold. Mainly due to the fact that one morning while eating my breakfast of champions, snickers and coffee, I inhaled my coffee. It led to disturbing the peace of our sunrise on the porch as I sprayed my coffee all over the porch. Everyone stopped what they were doing staring, and in the world of a thirteen year old, ""That was gross."" Second fold, due to my big dreams, I am one with many aspirations. Kyle is still in need of a name, Hot Boots and Hot Pants have been thrown out. Liason has been thrown in because he talks for us when we don't want to talk to people.

We left with a short day ahead, with promises of a pick up from Glampress and Torque's friends. We made it into town by lunch time and ate at the famous barn restaurant. I am not really sure why it's so famous other than that they serve food not cooked on a hiker stove. Our ride arrived, Franklin and Robert, and they spoiled us by taking us all around town to get our chores done.

Slack packing is a wonderful thing. How your body feels with weight and no weight is a world of difference. Our plans included 20 miles and rain. This is not something we are new too, but this time, we knew we had a shower and warm room to return to. Virginia's terrain and elevation have been kind to us. The miles have come easier and more gentle. Hiking with us was Franklin, one of Torque and Glampress's friends. He was a trooper! We have had six weeks to work up to that kind of mileage and he came out and just got it done. The logistics of the pick up were a little tricky with six of us hiking. As we only had a 5 person vehicle, we had to take two trips. We hiked in groups of three, Kyle, Brock, and GQ in the lead to secure the first ride and send the car back. Kathy, Franklin, and I bringing up the rear. You may notice we were missing a person, Glampress was injured and was Robert's trusty co-pilot, making sure he found us. For Torque and I, it was our first time hiking without our hiking partners. We both had a moment of disappointment when we passed the quarter way sign and our partners weren't with us for the picture. However, I so appreciated walking with Torque, and getting to know her a little more. The guys made it to the road for pick up and that is where the chaos began. The road was an unmaintained  forest service road eight miles long, taking 45 minutes just to get to the main road. The car was scrapping bottom the whole way down the road. The one way trip back to the hotel was an hour and a half. Rather than leaving the last three stranded at trail, they dropped the guys off at a general store so they could be indoors and wait. The whole ordeal of shuttling everyone back to the hotel took over five hours. When we got back to the hotel there had to be a meeting of the minds. We had to figure out something different, because we somehow needed to go back to that road, but our current situation was not working. It became stressful because by the time we were planning it was 9pm and we were hungry, tired, and all the hostel and shuttle services were closed for the evening. The only option seemed to be a zero.","I-81 Atkins VA

An unintended zero, but much appreciated. Today we zeroed because after the mess we were left with last night shuttling six people back and forth to the trail. We desperately needed a new plan. Early this morning we got a call from Days Inn Hostel, the only person who offered to touch FSRD 222. Even better, he had a truck. It gave us clearance, and room for six if you count the truck bed. Jeremy, the hostel owner, offered us great deals on shuttling, and he had space for the six of us for two nights. The logistics were falling into place and now we could enjoy the day. In the words of Papa G, ""The hardest thing about zeroing today is getting a hold of the massage clinic."" So our plan quickly became ""treat yourself."" Several of us went for pedicures, treating our feet, a body part that has seen a lot of abuse. I told the lady who did my pedicure, ""I have a lot of callouses, I have worked very hard for them, and I need them."" She laughed and said, "" So you want me to leave them?"" The whole nail salon took such interest in our hike and what we were doing. The workers took extra care of our feet, lingering a little on the massages, knowing how much we appreciated them. Brock, skipping the pedicure, found himself a neat little restaurant and bar, The Wooden Pickle. He proceeded to open and close the place. He earned himself a bronze plaque that will say Naynay's Barstool. We joined him ourselves and spent 6 hours eating and drinking our way through the menu.","

Sundays are my favorite, there is something different about Sundays. It may be my outlook or attitude, but Sundays always go lazily. I don't know if you can call 20 miles lazy, but it went by with ease and at a slow pace. With or new plan for shuttles in place, our hiking groups became clear: women in one, men in the other. The women took the first shuttle out to the trail putting us 3 hours ahead of the men. This hurt my heart a little. Not because I was placed in the ""slow group"" but because we left the hotel by 6:30am. This meant breakfast at 6am, meaning I woke up by 5:40am. The last time I saw that time on a clock was an hour and twenty minutes before I got off my last night shift. When we made it to the trail head, luckily there was a hiker at the intersection we were able to ask which direction she was hiking. We needed to head south, and having not been to the intersection before, we were all turned around. Road crossing don't always have the direction of the AT clearly marked and compass directions aren't always reliable either. ""South"" on the AT can sometimes be north, East, or west. Although I find Kyle and I hike great together, meaning he hangs back with me at my pace, and I push myself to keep a good pace throughout the day, I find that Torque, Glampress, and I, have a natural pace with one another. What I have found over these last two twenty mile days is that slowing it down a little leaves me less tired and my feet don't ache nearly as much. The mens, as we call them, caught up to us in perfect timing. We were six miles from our pick up location, approximately two hours away. We called our shuttle driver and arranged a pick up, and the timing couldn't have been more perfect. The ride off FSRD 222 was so much better without the rain and in a large pick up truck. It was still a long drive but the fear of losing the muffler as we scrape the bottom of the vehicle the whole way down was not there. The hostel that we booked for two nights is an experience. The owner hiked the trail last year and, after getting off the trail, opened a hostel. Still very new to the process, and also a single male. I say that because we are staying in his home, which reminds me of a boys' college apartment. The bunks, which we stayed in, are in a sunroom/ addition separated from the living room by a blanket tacked to the wall. One of the girls offered to clean the bathrooms for a reduced stay. The owner is a great guy, helpful in anyway, gives great deals, but could maybe use a women's touch. However, as always, a shower and a real bed are always a bonus.","Suiter Rd

We started today with a free breakfast provided by a local church down the road from our drop off location. Only GQ, Kyle, and I, went to breakfast, the others wanted to get straight to hiking. With our shuttle pick up being so close, it allowed for us to separate some. Knowing Brock hikes fast and he was starting close to an hour and a half before us, he was able to call ahead for his own shuttle, not leaving him to wait for us. We did however hope to catch Glampress and Torque so that we could all get a ride back in one car. This meant we had some ground to make up. We did catch up to them, but I will say in some ways it took away from my hiking day. The trail was easy, the day was beautiful, but at one point I was struck with the thought that I didn't come out here to speed through the day. We did what we needed to today but something I wouldn't want to do everyday. I give Glampress and Torque a lot of credit because slack packing is a huge logistics puzzle and a luxury that takes a lot of work. Then adding six people in the mix, it is a miracle we all made it out of the woods. The joy of a hot shower, laundry, a matress and a pillow will never get old, but I am missing my home in the woods. The solitude of our tent, and the sounds of the night is something I am longing for tonight. So tomorrow we head back into the trail with loaded packs. It will be a slightly rude awakening to set out with fully loaded packs after 5 days without them.","Suiter Rd

Back to the woods today and what a glorious day it was. We got a good taste of what Virginia has to offer. Easy days with a stop for lunch at a grill and soaking in the sun while cooling off in a waterfall. Dissmal Falls came mid day in our hike, and with only two hours of hiking until we would reach camp, we could spend all day taking it in. This is what hiking without a schedule is all about, spending hours at a waterfall, eating, napping, soaking your feet, and taking a dip to cool down. The temperature reached 83 degrees giving us a taste of what's to come in the summer. This is the life.","Lickskillet Hollow

Another day in the life. Although we had decent miles planned for today, we made time to relax. Half way through our day we came to a hostel, Woodshole. Even though we had not planned to stay, this was a hostel not to miss. They are known for their sustainable farming and fresh, homemade foods. For lunch we were able to partake in smoothies made with milk and ice cream from their cows, bread, cheese, butter, coffee, and cookies. We spent nearly two hours with our shoes off rocking on the front porch of the hostel and eating. The last two days that we have stopped to break midday have been so enjoyable that it has felt like a whole new day with new energy to take on the remaining miles. This may be a new routine that we adopt over the summer as we deal with the heat. We had a large morning climb and the temperatures were already scorching. A few of us were lazy getting out of camp which meant the heat of the day was already setting in. The sweat was pouring within our first half a mile. Within our sweat lines on our shirts we could see the salt, which caused us to think of our electrolyte replacement. As the days continue to get hotter, we will start taking electrolyte supplements to replace what we are losing. Starting earlier in the morning, breaking mid day, and finishing our hike as the sun is going down, may be what keeps us out of the heat of the day.","Wapiti Shelter

The joy of pushing miles yesterday is that we were left with only about an hour hike into Pearisburg. Working to get a ride into town was a bust. It was just a mile hike into town and after only a short hike. We made it into town in time for breakfast and spent the remainder of the afternoon doing normal town chores. Dad met us in Pearisburg and is helping us with getting back to Trail Days in Damascus. Trail Days is an annual festival, similar to a reunion of hikers. The town is filled with gear vendors and services catered to hikers' needs. Dad was able to get a taste of what coming into a trail town is like. The hikers moving about, gathering together and catching up, and of course the constant eating.","Angel's Rest

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567004,"Kyle, GQ and I spent the weekend at Trail Days and Brock just joined us for one of the days. We spent the weekend checking out vendors, scoring free gear, and attending talks related to the trail. The great thing about Trail Days, and I think one of the biggest draws for people, is catching up with other hikers. Hikers who you have lost track of and haven't seen in weeks. The town people understand the needs of hikers, and many organizations put on hiker feeds. Throughout the town we could find good food, and often free. One of the largest events of the weekend is the Hiker Parade which consists of thousands of hikers from all different years lined up parading through town. A tradition during the parade is a super soaker war with the towns people. It was only fitting that during the parade, the rain started and it poured, which just added to the water war. The hikers cheered and hollered as the thunder and lighting came, we are a strange group of people. The nights were filled with entertainment, from karaoke, line dances, live bands and bonfires. When hikers come together in these towns, it is interesting to see the diversity of people and personalities. People who otherwise wouldn't be associated together due to different interest or personality, but the trail or identity of being a hiker brings us all together. The differences fall to the side and the bonds of a hiker stick. There is an area which the town designated as Tent City. From the road you just see rows and rows of tents, but as you follow the trails back into the woods the camps of tents become elaborate, and take on identity. You can visit camp Riff Raff or Wonderland, and each with its own expansive set up. The bonfires take place back in the camps, and often times accompanied by drum circles and fire dancing. Although thankful to have not stayed in tent city, it is something to experience, just for the people watching alone. 
Kyle also went official with his trail name over the weekend, P.R. (Public Relations). He is the talker of our group, the one who mingles with all the other hikers. We often have to walk away and wait for him to catch up after he finishes speaking with other hikers. It's great for our group, because although we will all socialize to some extent, we can be a more quiet group at times and P.R. can take over the relations.","

We left Damascus this morning after church and worship service. We headed back to Pearisburg and onto the trail. We wanted to get a few miles in to lighten the load of miles this week. It felt like time to be back on the trail. Too many days away and I miss it, I start having a nervous energy. Dad got us back right to where we left off and we were to camp by six. Just in typical fashion, it started to rain as soon as we left the car and started on the trail. We met up with Brock in the shelter and had space to stay dry and warm. 
Over the weekend, during trail days, we attended a talk by a former hiker, now performance psychologist. She was doing research in the qualities or personality traits of a thru-hiker, and furthermore which held significance towards completion. One trait she discussed was mental toughness. She asked us to rate our own mental toughness on a scale of 1 to 7, 1 being not tough, 7 being really tough. I truthfully ranked myself at 5. I didn't rank myself at a five because I think I am some mental locker of steel, but because prior to hiking, and even more so now, I felt it would take quite a bit of mental toughness. I was surprised to hear the mean of her studies showed hikers rated themselves below a 3. Again, I don't think I am hot stuff, but I do feel that I have the mental toughness that it takes to hike the trail. So what I came to believe is that I must hold a high value in mental toughness. Prior to the trail, over the last year, I felt that in order for me to have a chance at completion, I would need to be mentally tough. I needed to change my outlook, work on my attitude. Although I am thankful for the shaping of my attitude over the past year, based upon her studies, a high mental toughness score did not equate to completion.","Pearisburg

A full day with full packs. I am thankful today that the rain held off. The hike was mild, even flat most of the day. Flat days are easy strides, and days that I become more chatty. Kyle and I had the chance to catch up and reflect on the weekend. The end of our day was filled with some steeper climbs, and after being out of practice over the few days, they kicked my butt. They say to be careful with slack packs, especially as you get further north. We worked hard to acclimate our muscles and our backs to the weight, and it's amazing how quickly your body gets lax. We made it to camp with a relaxed afternoon allowing us to dry soggy clothes from yesterday. We also played a game of Exploding Kittens, a card based game, which GQ bought for us to play in camp.","Rice Field Shelter

After 64 days it finally happened. It has been raining off and on all day today. The forecast called for rains to cease this afternoon, but it only seemed to intensify. In the past, although walking and sleeping through storms, we have always lucked out or put ourselves in a position to be inside. In the past we have made it to shelter before the rain, or set up our tent before the rain, but not so today. We made it to the shelter, which was full, and began setting up our tent in the rain. The tent went up with ease but the hardest part was dealing with all our wet gear. After we got situated, we didn't want to leave for the night. For the first time we cooked and ate from inside our tent. We have been lucky to have made it this far, but I feel that tomorrow morning might prove more difficult. Wet, cold gear, and rain is never a fun thing to wake up to. Aside from the wet gear, I love nights in the tent with the rain. I love the sound of the rain as it hits the rain fly. I love the sounds it makes on the trees. I love the sound of the distant rumble of thunder. The rain forces you into relaxation. You retreat to your tent, for us as early as 4:30pm. It creates time for quiet, reflection, for reading, journaling and rest.","Bailey Gap

Kyle and I planned for an early departure as to not keep Brock and Alan waiting at our pick up location. We woke up just after 6am and were on the trail by seven. We started early but it was a relief that we didn't have to bust it. The morning was cool, and most of our gear still wet. The motivation was we were headed to a hostel. We started in the rain, but before long the rain stopped. Many of the river crossings were rushing. Two in particular that were supposed to be rock hops were flowing with rapids and the crossing proved to be difficult. I was lucky to have Kyle with me, otherwise I may have ended up in the water, or have waded through. By early in the hike my boots and socks were sloshy. At one point I had to stop, pour the water out of my boots and wring out my socks. The hike elevation and miles were easy, but one ridge stretch of about two miles was tricky. The top of our mountain today was an exposed ridge of rocks. Rocks can be tricky in good conditions, but add days of rain and they become slick. I had a few tumbles, and a few times that I started on my butt as to not risk the fall. These areas slow me to a snails pace. I am cautious (rightly so), but also lack confidence in each step. I have to take big breaths because not only does it demand a lot of me physically, but mentally as well. This terrain will challenge me as we head north and hit more of these rocky areas. In fact, tomorrow will give me further practice as we take on an area called the Dragon's Tooth. 
Let's go back and remember the motivation for getting up and moving this morning, the promise of a hostel today. Let me start by saying I am thankful for a roof over my head as it poured down rain, but sleeping in someone's open barn, where the chickens roost under the bench you are sleeping on, was not what I got out of bed for this morning. An experience I will not quickly forget, 4 Pines Hostel, it is one of a kind.","Laurel Creek

What a day! Slack packing led to big miles. The rivers are roaring because of the constant rain. The first river crossing we went to forked into at least 5 main streams. There were around 12 hikers that had just been dropped off at the trail head and Brock was the first to take on the river. Unfortunately the river took on him. We looked over and Brock was in the river, which was up to his chest, and his hat and trekking poles were taken down the river. He was already soaked, so he waded around in the water and found his poles. We quickly learned his route was not the way to go. Brock was soaked and couldn't have gone more than 0.2 miles. Moving forward, the day started to look up. The sun came out for the first time in several days. Then seven miles in, Granny and Old Goat, who you may remember as trail angels in Georgia, served us breakfast. After breakfast, it was a climb to the Dragon Tooth. The Dragon Tooth was not nearly as challenging as I feared. It had some scrambles and we certainly could have lost our footing, but we made it down without too much difficulty. The challenge did come when Kyle and I took a wrong turn and ended up at the bottom of the mountain, then had to climb back to the top. It was an easy 45 minute detour, and by then our group was way ahead. Kyle and I got back on track and we booked it. We made it to the road crossing for pickup within 5 minutes of the rest of the group. We had motivation to make it to the crossing because the proprietor of the hostel who shuttles is less than accommodating. We knew if we had to call for another pick up after  the group had left, we probably wouldn't get a ride. The group called for our shuttle and we were on our way to dinner. The Homeplace, is a family style all you can eat dinner. The dinner included fried chicken, pulled pork, roast beef, biscuits, mashed potatoes, gravy, vegetables, baked fruit, coleslaw, pinto beans and all you can drink sweet tea and lemonade. We had round after round of more food brought out. After 22 miles we were starved and we ate so much food. 
We made it back to the hostel and had to dry out our feet, which have taken such a beating after spending several days in soggy boots. Kyle's feet now have blisters that caused him grief the last half of the day. My feet my be permanently pruned and also have some new blisters they are sporting.","VA 621

After such a long day yesterday, and the effort we put forth to catch up in the end, I was tired today. Starting out, my legs felt like they were weighted. After a few miles it got a little easier as the muscles warmed up. Early in our day we made it to McAfee Knob, one of the most iconic and photographed places on the AT. If you have ever Googled AT, a picture of someone standing on a rock outcropping, overlooking the valley below probably came up, and that is McAfee Knob. We spent some time taking photos and enjoyed the views. Later in the day, we made it to Tinker Cliffs, which again gave us beautiful views down into the valley. We learned later that the Virginia area has its own Triple Crown, McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, and Drangon's Tooth, which we did the day before. 
The end of our hike offered a frustrating end. We could see the town for close to 10 miles down in the valley, but we continued to climb. The milestones marked in the book were also few and far between, so it was hard to determine how many miles we had left. We just knew we were climbing but the town was below us. Finally with less than 1.5 miles to go the trail took us steeply to town. As far as we knew we had been following Brock and GQ, but we had never caught them. We figured they had been motivated by town to secure rooms at the hotel. We made it to town got to the front desk at the hotel, asked for the Fesmire room, ""No one with that name has checked in yet"" she said. No Brock and no GQ. It was strange, we had no idea where we could have passed them. Maybe they went straight for lunch, we thought, but surely they would have waited. After a while of waiting we decided we would check in and get to our room and wait for them to arrive. As we finished the check in process, they came walking up the road. Apparently, they had a similar detour like we had made the previous day. They missed a turn and in that time we must have passed them. All the while, we were trying to keep a decent pace to catch up. 
After showers came dinner, and with dinner, they gave hikers free banana pudding. A relaxing evening, and a great start to our weekend of relaxation after two pretty tough days.","VA 311

After the typical town chores we had a relaxing, yet different, zero. We took a drive along the Blue Ridge Parkway and saw some of the vistas that we will be hiking past in the next few days. We also visited a local winery. We sampled wines and bought some to drink on the grounds overlooking the mountains. The guys laughed and thought it was just the wine talking, but sitting there overlooking the mountains, I was humbled. I was humbled and  grateful. There are so many who have attempted the trail and for many reasons have not made it to where we were. The mountains that stood in front of me are rugged and have dangers. Many look to conquer nature, and in a way I guess I might be as well, but I was humbled to be among them, and to be there to enjoy it.","

Today we did an interesting form of slack packing. We did a key swap. This meant half our group walked north from the hotel, the other half drove the car to the north end location and hiked south. Along the path we crossed and handed the keys off and the group hiking north drove the car back. This allowed 10 of us to slack pack. Because some of those hiking with us were visitors, we just did a short 12 mile day so we were back in town by lunch. After relaxing most of the afternoon, we made and evening trip into Roanoke with GQ and Arthur. We walked around the downtown and had dinner before returning to the hotel.

Sleeping in was such a treat. I didn't crawl out of bed until 10am and it was marvelous. GQ started our day with a genius idea. We all had more than enough food to get us past the next town but we didn't want to waste it either, so we thought our only option was to carry it. GQ, however, came up with the idea to drive it forward to Glasgow, the next town we would be stopping in. This allowed us to only carry 3 days of food versus 8 days. We made it to the trail around 2pm and had only a few hours hike to make it to the shelter. 
We have also picked up a new hiking partner. Stoic, we have met several times along the trail. He had been hiking with two other hikers, but suddenly before Daleville, they had to go home for a family emergency. Stoic has blended well with our group. Seeing as we all hike our own hike during the day and gather together each night at the shelter, it seemed to fit his style as well. 
After dinner, I could see the colors of the sky as the sun was setting through the trees so I went in search of sunset views. We had just been talking earlier today that you might think living outside for several months you would see sunsets nearly every day. However, I can count only a handful of sunsets I have seen on the trail. You have to work to see them. Shelters and campsites many times don't offer sunset views, so you have to hike out to see them. Tonight though I found a small clearing in the trees that offered views into the valley, with mountains in the distance, and the sun setting behind them. We had a fire to relax near before heading to bed, and I was reminded once more how much I love falling asleep to the sounds of nature.","Black Horse Gap

We slept in some today, I guess Kyle and I had different ideas of how today might go. Although we had short miles, we are starting to battle some heat. Not far into our hike today was a nice swimming hole. We did stop to swim, eat snacks, make coffee, and relax a bit.  However, Kyle had in mind we might spend most of the day there and hike the remaining almost 9 miles later in the afternoon. I did not have the same idea and didn't like having so much of the day ahead. So after spending an hour or more there, and waking up late, we were setting out on the rest of our miles in the heat of the day. Luckily today was not a total scorcher, but we were hot. We did end up stopping at a shelter a few miles later and took another hour or so break to eat lunch and avoid some of the heat.
Last night while we sat around the fire, we discussed what, if anything, we feel might have changed in us since the start of our hike. We are 1/3 of the way through this, and sometimes it doesn't feel as if much has changed. You come out here some with more expectations than others and different reasons for that matter, but for me and for Kyle we have hoped for growth and change. Today, Kyle discussed with me that he has felt a difference. One of his hopes for the trail was a deepening of his faith. That by getting away from the distractions he might take time to listen and lean into God. I would have to agree with him, that is exactly what the trail has done for us. It's stripped us of a lot of our daily distractions and given us the time to focus on Him. To listen to Him. I thought back in preparation for the trail and not once did I feel that hiking the AT was outside of God's plan for us, but I didn't really understand it. It was a desire of our hearts, but felt more like a desire of the flesh. We weren't looking to be missionaries of the trail, we weren't hiking for a cause, we just wanted to hike and have the experience. God knew He could use this time to align our desires with His. He knew with the distractions gone He could reach us and we would listen.","Cove Mountain Shelter

It was another warm day with clear blue skies. However, with nearly 5 miles left we rounded a mountain and that all changed. The skies darkened, there were sheets of rain coming down in the distance, the wind picked up, and it started cooling off. We started to get hit with light sprinkles consistent enough that we put our rain cover on our packs. The skies and the weather in the distance looked as if it was going to unleash on us any minute. Then, just as quickly as it came, we rounded another mountain and it was gone. We had sprinkles of rain throughout the night, but nothing more.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

When slack packing we get shuttled to and from different trail heads, and I am convinced that some of our shuttle rides have been more dangerous than anything on the trail. Many times the shuttle drivers known the area and drive the roads so often that they end up flying down winding mountain roads, many times gravel as well. Today was no different. We had so many people that we went in two car loads, and our car on a few different occasions locked up its breaks as we were inches from slamming into the car in front of us. Other times we have been in the bed of a pick up and the drivers take no mercy on those in back, continuinuing to drive at high speeds. It's in some of the shuttles that I think, ""this is how my AT hike will end."" However, we make it to and from and we hike on.
 Slacking was of course wonderful. We passed many hikers we knew as we headed south. One even said, ""you all slack more than anyone out here."" They aren't wrong. I didn't imagine that we would slack pack this much and we don't always plan for it. Many times the opportunity just presents itself. We made it back by late afternoon with plenty of time to shower again and retreat to my lazy boy for the night. We watched several movies, ate Donna's dinner, then proceeded to our junk food. The hostel was quiet and we were settling down for bed when a well known and talked about snorer walked through the door. Kyle and I have stayed with him in previous bunk houses,and he rattles the walls with his snore. I quickly made sure he knew bunk space was avaliable across the hall. We were in need of a good night sleep. We have been battling horrible bug bites, some caused by chiggers, others by midges, or no see-ums as others call them. It's not uncommon for each limb to be covered in 10-15 bites. They itch like crazy, and at night when trying to sleep, it feels like your skin is crawling. We have resorted to benadryl at night to help with the itch and maybe help us sleep. Needless to say we didn't need the walls shaking as well.","Glasgow

I have said this before, but after slack packing, heading out with a full pack feels twice as heavy. We passed the 800 mile mark right off the bat. It's so hard to wrap my mind around the fact that my own two feet have carried me this far. Half way through the day we hit a huge up hill, 3000 feet over 4.5 miles. As I was climbing I realized we haven't done any climbs of this magnitude in some time. In Georgia, it was nearly every day, North Carolina and Tennessee we saw several long and tall climbs, but not recently in Virginia. Now don't be fooled by the misconception that Virgina is flat. It's far from flat, in fact we have a lot of elevation change every day. The difference is that it is usually 500 to 1000 feet over a mile or less multiple times through the day. Elevation like that you can easily bust out. A 4.5 mile climb however, that's nearly two hours of climbing and it takes a little more out of you. I was beat, my legs started feeling like jello. In true Virgina fashion, our climb gave us no view. We hiked down, because what you go up, you must go down. We got to a beautiful open meadow that did however give us great views. Seeing the many day hikers picnicking tempted me to stop and maybe even take a nap. I felt so low on energy. I pushed on however and thankfully we did because right around the corner was trail magic. Former hikers were out grilling burgers and hotdogs, cold drinks and chips. We rested there for an hour or more. We even had time for a game of Exploding Kittens and a swing in an old tree swing in the meadow. We had just a few miles left in our day and I finally felt energized. I felt like I could have gone on all night. As always though, it is good to get into camp.","FS Rd 39

We had some big miles ahead of us today. The weather was beautiful causing me to want to stop and take in each vista and side trail. We had some pressure to make it to the shelter in decent time due to rain in the forecast overnight. We did however take some time to take in one side trial at Spy Rock. After some serious but brief rock scrambles, we made it up to a rock bald with 360 degree views. We ended our day with some serious downhill followed by 1000 feet of climbing. I was beat. We made it to the shelter and it was such a treat. Not only were we the first four at the shelter, but a small cascading creek was right out front. The creek offered a cold soak for sore feet and ankles, as well as a cold but refreshing bath.","Greasy Spring Road

The days in this section after Glasgow have been somewhat difficult. Many hikers have voiced that feeling. We have had some long climbs each day. As I said just a few days ago, we haven't dealt with the long climbs for a while, so they feel like hitting a brick wall. Today we had a climb ahead, but we also woke up to rain. We knew it was coming so we had a shelter spot. We started with dry gear, unlike some hikers that were caught of guard. The rain was no motivation to get out of camp early. Instead, we stayed in the shelter, ate breakfast, drank coffee and didn't move from the shelter until almost 10:30am. By far the latest we have ever left camp. We kept the day short in miles. There was talk of a brewery off the next Gap, and we couldn't think of a better place to get out of the rain. We made it to the gap while it continued to rain as we tried to hitch. These are always the hardest days to try and get a hitch because people don't really want dirty, wet hikers in their car. We got lucky however, and after maybe 10 minutes, a mom and her daughter stopped. The mom stopped and said ""I don't mind giving you a ride, but I have my daughter with me. So as long as you won't bite us, hop on in."" They got us to Devil's  Backbone Brewery, and the property was so much nicer than we ever expected. There was a restaurant, concert area, outdoor eating and they even allowed us to camp on the property. Getting out of wet clothes and waiting out the rain was such a treat. The evening turned out to be a beautiful one.","Harpers Creek

Another late start this morning. The brewery not only allowed us to camp on their property, but they offered a hiker breakfast including eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, fruit and coffee. They also gave us a ride back to the trail head. Again, a shuttle that I thought was the most dangerous part of my day. I felt less than motivated today. We had fairly short and easy miles and I wasn't in much of a rush to get to camp. However, I realized I think I have vacation brain. You know that feeling right before you are about to leave on vacation and your last shift of work is not very motivating because you checked out to vacation time? That's what we are experiencing in trail terms. Tomorrow we have 5 miles until we get into town, from there we will take one zero and then start a week of slack packing. Between friends of GQ and my parents, we will be slack packing nearly 150 miles. 
Camp tonight offered a nice relaxation. We retreated to our tents early. The shelter and camping were situated on the banks of a cascading river, giving us a soundtrack to fall asleep to.","Reid Gap

This is where things start to get a little bit crazy. We had several visitors who came out to support and hike with us. Although amazing to have friends and family out with us, it does tend to throw off our routine. Each day was long and after we shared in stories and laughs, it didnt leave much time for my journal entries. So in efforts to fill you in on this time, I plan to combine some sections. I will make sure to hit all the highlights with every up and down. So please keep your hands inside the vehicle, it is about to be a crazy ride.
We had a 5 mile hike into Rockfish Gap. This is where we hopped off trail and got into Waynesboro, VA. We had reservations at the Stanimal Hostel, which is owned by the same proprietor as the one in Glasgow. As always our first day in town consists of cleaning ourselves and our clothes. Stanimal had loaner clothes that we were able to wear around town, which is always fun. I sported child size athletic pants with an extra large hoody. Kyle in swim trunks and a nascar tee, and Brock in a salmon colored polo. GQ may never live down his ensemble, gray on gray 3 sizes too big sweat pants and t-shirt. Now GQ's outfit was in no way worse than any of ours, but quite the contrast to his normal put together attire. We had a night out to the movies, but on our way back we had our closest, most dangerous wildlife experience. Walking along the road back to the hostel, in the dark, we nearly stepped on a family of skunks. Luckily we didn't get sprayed, but I wasn't about to stick around and test them. The following day we zeroed. Rest was much needed after the crazy stretch from Glasgow. Most of the day consisted of movie marathons, sleeping, and eating. GQ's friends and their children made it into town. They stopped by the hostel where we got to meet them and their 6 children. We planned what the next two days of slack packing, camping, and meals would look like. They planned to help transport our packs, feed us lunch, and camp each night with us. The plans were made and the kiddos couldn't be more excited. The trail is import to the family, and the kids have good knowledge of the trail, because their father, Bob, previously completed a thru-hike. After a late night of movie watching we made it out of bed and back to the trail sans our packs. Bob and his oldest boy joined us for our first few miles. Within the first mile of our hike we crossed the southern boundary of the Shenandoah National Park. Our last national park of the trail, and one that would carry us nearly 100 miles. We were greeted with lunch by 6 smiling little faces half way through the day. We departed from lunch and headed towards the shelter. We were again greeted by 6 smiling faces in camp. The family hiked one mile into camp with everyone carrying some weight. They were so excited to be AT hikers. Their enthusiasm was contagious.
The following morning we hiked out of camp with the family. We had quite the caravan and a slow moving one at that. We didn'mind it one bit, they made our morning so much fun. After they got off the trail that's when we really had to kick it in to gear. We had some miles to bust out and people to meet. Those people just happened to be my mom and Brian, my step dad who started the trail with us. We made it to lunch where again, yes, you guessed it, we were greeted by 6 smiling faces. Mom and Brian were running behind schedule, so not only did we linger a little at lunch, but we made time for milkshakes. One of the biggest perks of the Shenandoah section is all the waysides and campstores, ice cream everyday. We finally finished our day and met mom, Brian, and Eli, my little brother. They had some scrambling to do after they got into the park and found all the campgrounds to be full. However, by the time they picked us up all was taken care of and we made it to a campground complete with showers, electricity, and a pool. Bob and his family camped with us one last night and from there, the spoiling continued.","Wolfe Shelter

The slack packing continued and we were ready to kick some miles' butt. The great thing about the Shenandoah is that Skyline Drive covers the whole length of the park. This offers tons of oppotunitues to get on and off the trail. Great for logistics of planning slack pack days, but also for Brian and Eli to get some hiking in with us. There was no mercy. Brian, fresh out of the gate, took on an 18 mile hike with us. He was a trooper. Meanwhile, back in camp mom slow cooked a beef stew in the dutch oven. We definitely worked up an appetite, but before we left the campstore we had to have ice cream. Dinner was devoured, and beyond what we could dream of eating out on the trail. The following morning we headed out for a 16 mile day. Brain stayed back to help tear down camp and move the caravan forward. We hiked into Skyland Lodge. Frankly, it was overpriced, outdated, and lacked air conditioning, but you paid for the view. Our rooms had a sunset view over looking the mountains. It also put us in perfect hiking location as we hiked into and out of it with no transportation needs. The week started to get more emotional at this point. Brock, or Chardonaynay, had been dealing with some shoulder pain for some time, but this week, the pain had move to his back. His hope was that rest and hiking without a pack would give it time to heal. However, by this time it wasn't improving. He made the decision to rest for the remainder of the week and give it time to heal. We headed out the next morning and the trail noticed the absence of Brock. We all struggled throughout the day. Our physical state was starting to wear on us after four high mile days, but our emotional state was even lower. We spent most of our hiking day praying and wrestling with emotions. Sorting through ifs and thens. By lunch time we were down, we looked forward in the weather for the week, and it looked even more gloomy. We decided then it wasn't worth the push to do crazy miles and be miserable. We decided we would move forward over the next few days but to be easy on ourselves. We made it through our day and back to a new campground where mom not only fed our stomachs but our souls. We hiked out the following day and planned for only a 12 mile day. Keep forward momentum, but to hopefully avoid the rain headed our way. We finished the day and beat the rain. We only had a small drizzle in the evening, enough that cooking over fire coals was a little interesting. The rain cleared over night and what was supposed to be a rainout the following day was clear and beautiful.
I want to take some time to highlight the Shenandoah Park. The trail through Shenandoah is a breeze compared to the trail surrounding it. It sits up on a ridge line, keeping the elevation changes to a minimum. This also offers some great views of the ridges. Though the park is known to have the most dense population of black bears, we had come 900 miles so far and had seen no bears. We heard of other hikers sightings, and Brock had even seen 2 bears. We were starting to think we were the only ones. We were nearly about to leave the park, we had one day left in the park and still no bears. Then within a one mile stretch we encountered 4 bears. One was a cub and its momma bear. The bears couldn't have cared less about us. They would look at us and continue on with their business. After those bear sightings we saw 5 more the next two day, bringing the count to 9 bears in 3 days. These were exciting times. Shenandoah was also the first section hike that Kyle and I did back in 2014, where the dream of hiking the trail all started. It was fun to re-live some of the sections and see how easy they are after you have your trail legs established.Our last day of slack packing, we made it out of the Shenandoah. We positioned ourselves with just few enough miles to make it into Harpers Ferry in only 3 days. We felt good with our miles, just another easy 12. It even allowed for Eli to get out and hike with us, as well as some extra time in the evening to spend with my family. The last day the family was here we zeroed. They got a true picture of what hiker zeros looked like. We slept in, barely made it out of bed to go get breakfast, then got back in bed. By lunch time they were a little stir crazy and wanted to explore. So they ventured while we stayed in bed and ate some more. They made it back in time for dinner and to help us resupply. One last night of sleep in a real bed before heading back out into the real world of hiking, packs fully loaded.","Simmons Gap

Our first day in full packs in ten days. We had to get back to the real hiking world. The hiking and the weight felt surprisingly easy, but the heat was a whole different beast. The temperature reached the high 80s, and the humidity was 80% as well. The sweat poured off of us and the moisture in the air saturated everything. Our energy level was decent until we reached camp and then we were wiped out.  The heat really took it from us today. It became a struggle to make it through our chores and not just climb into bed and crash. There was a chance of rain overnight for a short window, but Kyle and I decided to set up camp anyway. The temperature was not showing signs of dropping, meaning we would spend most of the night on top of our sleeping bags. The last time I did that in a shelter, I woke up to 50 bug bites on one arm. The tent allows us to sleep with protection from bugs, in or out of our sleeping bags.
Overall with as bittersweet as our goodbyes were this morning, our feelings have stayed positive. It was difficult saying goodbye to Brock, not knowing if he will rejoin us later on. Our thoughts are with him. Prayers of healing, transition, and peace. Adjusting to life off the trail has come so much sooner for him than he imagined. Something we thought was months away became a reality over night. The trail can feel his absence as can our group. As wonderful as it was to have family here , and to slack some miles, it felt good to get back to the real trail. We were pampered and spoiled, and the company was so special, leading to long days and late nights. We didn't really adhere to our hiker midnight and I think our bodies recognized. After all the energy your body puts forth throughout the day, it needs the extra rest and sleep to recover.","VA 638

I am usually a fan of roller coasters, but this roller coaster was not one I would choose to ride again. The signs posted warnings, you are now entering the rollercoaster. I even fell below the ""you must be this tall to ride"" line. I should have heeded the warnings and met up at the photo booth. The Rollercoaster, a 13 mile stretch with 10 peaks and descents. On top of that load of nonsense, the temperature was 93, and humidity 90%. We had no hope of staying dry. We dripped in sweat all day long. Every climb required great effort and we were moving slow. It took us 10 hours to hike the 18 miles we had planned. The breaks are what saved us, and we took several. Nearly one an hour. We drank nearly 6 liters of water, lemonade, and electrolyte drinks. We felt hungry at times, but mostly too hot to even think about eating. Our saving grace came as we rolled into camp. The shelter listed was called a Trail Center. We didnt know exactly what to expect, but when we arrived we were pleasantly supprised. An old home sat on the property with a large wrap around screened in porch, which they allow hikers to sleep on. We fully intended on setting up our tent for the night, but simply rolling out our sleeping mats was heavenly. The caretaker offered us cold sodas, ice tea, lemonade, and sweet treats. There was even an outdoor shower to rinse away the day. What was a rather difficult and at times very frustrating day, turned into a realxing evening.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Miles into a town sometimes seem as if they are just miles standing in the way between you and town. I try in those moments to change the outlook, change my perspective, but sometimes you just really want to get into town. This is especially true when the skies decide to release a deluge on you, all the while the thunder roars and the lightning strikes. We were 2 miles to town when the thunder threatened over head. We hoped for a warning sprinkle before the rain started. Once it hit, it hit hard. The trail nearly instantly turned into a river and with one mile left Kyle and I started running into town.
Hapers Ferry is considered the unofficial half way point. The AT conservency is in town where hikers register and get their pictures taken. I laughed on the way into town at how perfect it would be to get our pictures as drowned rats. How real it would be. However when we made it to the conservency, the rain was coming down so hard they didnt want to take pictures outside. We decided to return the next day during our zero and get our iconic picture in front of the sign outside. We were the 963 and 964 hikers to make it half way. We zeroed by taking in some of the historic sites of the town. Visiting as a hiker felt much different than a tourist. The last thing I felt like doing was walking around town, but it's really the only way to get around town. I feel it made the town a little less enjoyable. Its a great accomplishment to be at this point, and I am excited to see what this second half brings. The work ahead will be challenging but the rewards will be so sweet and the journey unforgettable.","Blackburn Trail Center

After a waffle breakfast at the hostel this morning, it was hard to get out of the hostel before 10am. We climbed out of Harpers Ferry, making our way up to a ridgeline which we followed for the rest of the day. The miles were smooth sailing, so much so that we decided to hike a few more. We made it into a backpackers campground equipped with running water and hot showers. Although the camp had to be hiked into, road access was not far, so the mix of people made for some intersting people watching, or listening rather. Within this section of trail we find more frequent access to towns and roads, allowing us to carry out less food, and resupply more often.

After a strange evening with quite the mix of campers, we slept pretty well. We woke up rested and took it easy getting out of camp. Maryland has been fun in that there have been several historical sites. A few times a day we will come upon a park with old architecture with details of its importance, most of which held significance in the civil war. Several parks have offered picnic pavilions, restrooms and water spigots. Now this makes for a hikers paradise. Yesterday after hiking a few miles further, we debated pushing more miles again today or sticking with the 14 we had planned. Lunch came and we enjoyed soaking in the sun on the Black Rock Cliffs. After lunch we had less than 6 miles, but we decided an early day sounded nice. We settled into camp early, relaxed over dinner and headed for our tents with the sun still high in the sky. Our bubble of hikers that we have been running into over the last few days have been new. Its felt odd at this point to not recognize or know other hikers. We know of some behind and ahead, however, our hiking miles haven't aligned. There have been a huge increase in section hikers and many flip floppers, or long distnace south bounders. We have yet to see any south bound hikers who have started at Katahdin. Seeing as they start later in the hiking season, many are just getting started. Lying in my tent, with no agenda, journaling, reading, stretching and looking up into the trees, these are moments I remind myself to keep tucked away. These are moments some may not ever really experience and moments that in the futute I may yurn for.","Dahlgreen Campsite

It took over a month to get through Virgina. However, since we crossed the boarder we knocked off two more states pretty quickly. We are now in the north, we crossed the Mason-Dixon Line, and we are now traveling through our 7th state, Pennsylvania.
We held out hope that rumors of Granny and Old Goat serving their delicious trail magic would be true. We were told they had set up camp three miles from the shelter and they planned to pack up and leave after breakfast. With the rain we thought there would be a good chance they would be packed up and gone. As we turned to make the descent into the gap, a strong breeze blew through the sweet smells of breakfast. We took in all we could eat, and happened to miss the only real rain shower of the day. We took our time through the day, never looking to push the pace. Our ending  point for the day would be where Aurther would come to meet GQ and take us all into town. Even so, we made it to the road earlier than expected. The terrain was easy and nearly no change in elevation. A post it note with only a number, name and ""call for a ride,"" was left at the road crossing. So we called Roger and made it into town with free entertainment during the ride. His passenger, not sure her relation to him, was crazy. She had story after story, each one more insane than the last. As they drive away she rolled down the window, hangs out the side waving and wishing us luck on our journey. The hotel was a step above our usual digs, complete with hot tub and breakfast. We were set up for a good weekend. With Arthur visiting, it allows us to do a key swap, meaning we get to slack pack again. The rain came in with force, but only after we were tucked away in the hotel for the night. We have slept through our share of storms, but being inside during those storms is something I am thankful for.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Key swaps create an easy way of slackpacking where everyone invloved gets to hike. A key swap is when a car is parked at one end, hikers start at opposite ends, hike towards each other and hand off keys in the middle. This gave Arthur the chance to hike with GQ without having to go out with full packs. The first group of hikers we passed said, ""Imagine that, you guys are slack packing again."" Yep! We have got the slack pack down, and luckily we have a lot of supporters who want to help us. Pennsylvania had been talked up and rumored of being one giant rock field. The thing about rocks is they can get a little scary, and they slow you down big time. Although I do anticipate the rocks are coming, the first 30 miles of Pennsylvania have been a breeze, mostly flat with only a few rock scrambles. It has been tempting to power through miles, however, we dont have the need to. We also have no desire to rush this. Doing some simple math, from here on out we only need to average 12.5 miles a day to finish by our six month mark. This is something we have easily been able to maintain. It also allows us to alternate between higher miles and lower miles, giving our bodies a little bit of a break. We made it to our official half way point, 1094.9 miles from both Sringer Mountain and Mt Katahdin. It's a point that we have anticipated, now that we are here it is surreal that every mile forward we are closer to Katahdin than Springer. These last three months have gone by so fast, I can only imagine that these next three will be over in the blink of an eye. It's an even greater reminder to cherish and tuck away these momements and memories.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

The sign marking our official 2017 distance was a laminated 8×10, posted to a wooden pole, next to the road. Not much for the celebration of half way. Today, however, we passed several other signs that marked a more permanent halfway. We also entered a park marking a pervious halfway point, Pine Grove Furnace. The park still is home to the half gallon challenge. This is where AT hikers attempt to eat an entire half gallon of ice cream. No time limit, no award, just trail cred. Frankly something that only AT thru-hikers are crazy enough to not only attempt, but get excited for. Kyle considered taking on the challenge for the better part of the morning, but after we arrived and ate lunch, we all settled for just a couple of scoops of ice cream rather than the half gallon.
Pennsylvania has continued to change things up. Daily it seems as though we may walk through a small town, cross a road with conveniences, or take the trail through nice parks with luxuries such as water from a spigot, or flish toliets.

This weekend marks the last in our month long whirlwind of family and friends that have come to support us. After the 18 grueling miles to get us to our meet up with Arthur, we were ready to get back into a hotel. We discussed whether it was the ups and downs of these last few days, or just knowing that we only had three days out on the trail that drove us to get to the road crossing. We met up with Arthur late in the evening, and we were beyond exhausted. Luckily, our ambitions for hiking this weekend were not lofty ones. Saturday was our main day for hiking. After breakfast, which included scrapple, a Pennsylvania mystery meat delicacy, we hit the trail for a few hours sans packs. Sunday, although not a true zero would be our day of rest. We decided rather than spending the day holed up in the hotel, or walking somewhere not on the trail, why not give back. We set up at one of the trail crossings and served fellow hikers with trail magic. We saw some familiar faces, and met many new ones. It was a great way to get to know other hikers. When hiking, in passing, and many times in camp, hikers are focused or exhausted and may not be up for chatting. At trail magic, however, hikers usually take the time to relax a little, recharge and share in life. I truly enjoyed the day giving back to this community of people we are a part of. After magic, we took in dinner before hitting the trail. We had just a few miles to hit before sunset. We took a side trail to get up on the ridge and get views out over the valley. We hit this area right as sun was setting, making just one of a few sunsets I have seen on the trail. The sky was layered in beautiful colors, and although we had to take in a few more rock scrambles than we would have otherwise, it's a view I would have not wanted to miss.","Windsor Furnace

We started out with great optimism for the day and were excited to get back into the swing of full time backpacking. Our weeks and weekends of assistance have finally come to an end for a while. It has been truly amazing, but might have softened us a bit. After such an amazing night out in the woods, we watched the sunset and took in some stars, we were ready for a great day ahead. The first half of the day was nothing new, rocks. Halfway through our day we hit a rock scramble, which with the right outlook can be pretty fun. We scrambled up and enjoyed the views. However, the rocks were completly exposed to the sun, and we continued to stay exposed for the next few hours. The heat and the sun started to drain us. Our energy was zapped, and even after a boost of trail magic, we gave it all we had to reach camp. After we set up camp and caught our breath, we started to feel better. Tomorrow is a new day, and after a good night's sleep, we would be ready to take it on.","North Trail

Over night the rain started and it continued through morning. As we began to stir, the sound of rain caused us to just turn over and go back to sleep. Not that we have been early risers as of late, but the rain seals our fate, we leave camp late. The rain ended nearing nine, and we finally started to get moving. We were in a stretch with few reliable water sources, so our solution for water today was to go into town, fill up water, have lunch and head back to the trail for a few miles. The rocks continued throughout the day, but our spirits were lifted after our tough day yesterday. We made it into town just before 3pm in time for a late lunch. We filled our water and, before leaving town, took in a cup of coffee. We were ready to take on the remaining few miles. After leaving town it seemed as though we not only fed our stomachs, but our spirits as well. Not that we had bad attitudes prior to town, but leaving town it seemed as though we were gliding. Before we knew it we had made it 5 miles, even further than we anticipated going. The only reason we even stopped for a moment in the first place to check our distance was because we ran into some hikers we knew setting up their own tents. The sun was setting and soon it would be dark, and seeing as we made it further than even planned, we decided to call it a night. Camp was easy tonight. We packed out plenty of water from town and we were still satisfied from our late lunch. So, after setting up our tents, we crawled in and went to bed. The adjustment of getting back into the full swing of hiking with no assistance or hotels has been noticed. After our difficulties yesterday it was obvious our month of assistance might have softened us slightly. Although as thankful as we were for the short stop into town, it felt good to head out as quickly as we came, and get straight back into the woods, and under the stars.","Delps Trail

The greatest accomplishment of today is that we finished our seventh state, Pennsylvania. We have many endearing terms for PA, the most comonly used is Rocksylvania. Pennsylvania had been the talk of the trail prior to approaching it, with warnings of the rocks. For the southern half of the state I questioned what the fuss was all about, and then the rocks came about with vengeance. Over the last few days with our trials, and maybe with our nearing of the end, our patience of the rocks were through. We have been promised that with the end of Pennsylvania comes an end to the rocks, at least for a short while. We made it into town mid day giving us time to relax, shower and plan out the next few days. We found a local church that offers a donation based bunk house in the basement. The accommodations are minimal, but a roof and a shower are always appreciated. Tomorrow we set out to take on our eighth state of this journey.","Wind Gap

After the hostel quieted down nearing 2am, we were slow to rise this morning. We made a stop for breakfast before leaving town. So, by the time we made it to the trail, it was hot and muggy. Breakfast and coffee heavy on our stomachs, we drug ourselves up the hills, and even further more, up the rocks. Apparently the New Jersey and Pennsylvania line isn't a magic line in which the rocks stop. It has seemed as though the rocks have been taking their toll on our spirits. With the threat of rain, lack of sleep, and the troubling rocks, we decided to call it a day a few miles early. The Mohican Outdoor Center was 3 miles short of our final destination, but it provided a roof, food, and showers. Kyle and I actually tented on the property even with the threat of rain. However, we spent most of our time in the community center reading, eating, and spent the evening clean and refreshed. We prepared our tent space as best we could. We dug rocks out from the high groud and then built a rock and leaf watershed. Only time and the fall of rain will tell if the work paid off.","Delaware Water Gap

The rain came and with quite some force. Rain falls accumulated near 2 inches in just a few hours. The work we put in last night gave us the safety from the puddles forming all around the tent. Although some water started to seep in under our tent, most of our gear remained dry. The forecast showed a potential for break in the rain around 10am. We decided to pack up the contents in our tent  and make our way into the community center. Later, when the rain would break, we would take down the tent. In the mean time we woud watch the rain from the dry space, eating breakfast and drinking coffee. We stretched the morning. It was only after a tree had fallen on power lines and the center lost power that we finally started our hike. Although it rained most of our hike, it was an enjoyable hike. The rocks continued but we approached them slightly refreshed. The trail today had several chances for views, but due to the rain we couldn't see anything. We were lucky to arrive at the shelter before it was filled. The rain is forecasted to continue throughout the night and we are happy to not tempt the weather from our tent again tonight. We discussed the rain today and concluded that the actual hiking in the rain is not the most difficult part. The difficulties come after arriving in camp. It's when the feet are pruned, your body is wet and never really feels quite dry. There is a dampness to everything. Our gear stays wet and the following morning you anticipate the cold of putting on wet clothes. These are the moments that, although creating a story, show the reality that this is no vacation.","Mohican Outdoor Center

What an interesting day we had. We had a scheduled lunch date and a dinner date. We left the shelter on very little sleep. The war of mosquitoes vs hikers took place in the shelter overnight. Throughout the night hikers were swatting, smacking and woke in shifts to apply more bug spray. While in the trenches it felt as if we might have been better off taking on the rain from our tents. As I laid awake, I thought back to the last few times I spent in a shelter and said it would be my last. Once we started our hike, we made it under 4 miles before we made it to a gap where there also happened to be a tavern. We debated, with our lunch date due today, if we should stop. We found we had some time to spare, and it's not every day the trail provides a tavern. After a small snack, a short rest and a couple drinks, we had to push the pace. We had stayed a little too long. The tavern was on the shore of a small lake with lounging chairs and tables that seemed to suck you in. We made it to lunch only slightly behind schedule. Rachel, a good friend of GQ, brought us a great lunch. We met her family and shared our stories with her. Another suprise, Arthur came out to visit.
After lunch we decided to get in a few more miles before Gq's friends met us for dinner. After the last few miles we made it into town for a shower and laundry. With the rain this past week we lacked dry clothes. Prior to dinner GQ started to suffer from a migraine and stayed behind to rest. An experience I never would have imagined. Dinner with friends of a friend that we have never met.  However, these are the experiences that make this journey so rich, the people you meet and share life with, that you would not have the opportunity otherwise. Our sleeping arrangement made for the last turn of events of the evening. Kyle and I had decided not to stay in the motel. We had plans to make it back to the trail head and camp; however, we found there was no parking allowed. Arthur was going to have to take us and drop us off. He was more than willing, but when it neared midnight, we didn't want him to drive--nor did we want to set up camp at midnight. With GQ not feeling well and the lack of space in their room, Kyle and I slept in Arthur's car in the motel parking lot. Again, a scenario we would only find ourselves in while hiking the AT.","Brink Shelter

Two days ago our fates were sealed for today. We made the decision to make up time, and gain back the day we cut short. That meant adding miles to each day. Yesterday was a breeze, but the three extra miles added to our already planned seventeen was about enough to do us in. The day started pleasant with flat easy terrain and boardwalks. After lunch however, everything changed. An anticipated lunch stop at a farm stand that advertised sandwiches and fresh produce was a bust. We did get some produce to supplement our lunch, but there were no sandwiches. After we left lunch we made it to the New Jersey-New York border. We said goodbye to Jersey, and hello to our ninth state. New York greeted us with a hostile hello. We quickly began climbing up and over rock slabs to viewless summits. Many of the climbs were a series of boulder scrambles, requiring a hand over hand climb to pull yourself to the top. Our average of daily miles over the last several weeks has been lower, and today our bodies reminded us of that. We were pushed and pushed some more. Our bodies had already been challanged, and then the last five miles of climbs and scrambles exahusted us. At one point during the last few miles we realized we had only made it two miles in one and a half hour. Now that may not mean much to you, but we normally hike at a pace of three miles per hour. The last few miles drug on. We finally made the last descent into town and made it in for some pizza, a shower and a bed. Was it worth all we went through just to make up the day we lost? Maybe. I can't really say, but we all knew at the end of the day we were thankful to have made it into town.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Our hotel was lake front on Greenwood Lake. The hotel itself was odd. It offered a mixture of apartments and only 4 hotel rooms, which opened up to the restaurant outdoor seating. It was a hot day with the heat index reaching into the 100s, so we were thankful for a cool room to retreat to. We made our rounds from the room watching movies, to the deck for food, to the benches outside our room, back to our room, and continued that process over.","Greenwood Lake

With the chill from the AC in the hotel room causing us to retreat further under the covers and the darkness in our room from the blackout curtains, we didn't wake up until 10am. We got ourselves moving and made it to the trail. The access trail that goes from the AT to the town is one mile in length and steep. We recognized as we took the steep decent just two days prior that it would be a difficult climb back out. Well that held true this morning. We hit the trail near to noon so it was hot and muggy. The movement up the mountain was slow. After making it back onto the AT,  New York continued to win our vote for least liked state. There were several huge rock climbs requiring hand over foot climbs. These not only are slow and difficult, but a little scary as well. We made it to a lunch spot that would boost our spirits a bit. We ate lunch with our feet soaking in the pool at the base of a waterfall. The water was cold, which gave our feet some relief and cooled us down a bit as well. We had just under three hours of hiking left after lunch. Somewhere in that time we lost track of GQ, not positive whether he was ahead or behind. We trekked on and found him near where we had in mind to camp. The lake we camped near is known for beaver activity. Although we didn't see any, we saw their dams. The water at the lake, and the feeder stream, were pretty questionable. We found an area in which the water had some movement so from there we filtered our water. The water had a slight hue to it, but the smell and the taste were surprisingly decent. This is a time when you trust in your equipment. As soon as our tents were up, the thunder started to roll. Sprinkles came as we were in the middle of dinner. By the look and the sounds coming from the sky, we thought it was going to let loose, but it held off. We made it into the retreat of our tent before the rain really started to come. However, it never came down too hard, but provided a gentle patter on our tents for us to fall asleep too.","Greenwood Lake

The days in New York have continued to be some of our more challenging days. The terrain continues to give us ups and downs, literally. The temperatures, on top of it all, have left us exahusted. We have had our sights set on today for a while now. GQ had another friend, Peter, who came out to meet us for lunch. He brought us quite the spread. Our offer to the feast were fresh blueberries picked along the trail. We have been hiking along all kinds of berry bushes over the last week. Blueberries, blackberries, and wineberries. They have been so delicious and make a great addition to the morning oatmeal. We met Peter at a state park with beach access to Tiorati Lake. After lunch, we spent some time relaxing on the beach, swimming, and we even took a shower in the bath house. After lunch we hiked a few more rather difficult miles and made it to a shelter that offered views of New York City. We made it there with little light left, but the sky was clear and the lights of the city shined brightly. It was different, but in its own way a beautiful sight. We could see fireworks out in the distance and we watched from the mountain as we ate dinner. As several hikers sat staring down at the city, pondering the busy life of the million people down there, we thought there may not be a single person who ponders upon the several of us.","Little Dam Lake

Another day we have had our sights set on. Today offered a wide variety of things to see and do. Our biggest climb for the day led us up to Bear Mountain. It was clearly a heavily used local trail, and because of that it offered a pleasant, manicured hike up to the top. The top offered sights of New York City, a look out tower, and trail magic. After a pleasnat descent down from the mountain, we walked through the Trailside Zoo. It was a place for animals in rehabilitation, all of who would have otherwise been euthanized. We made it to the other side of the zoo as quickly as we came as it was rather small. It was nearing lunch time and, with the spoiling from the many delis and markets, we have found it difficult to want to eat our own food. So we made the decision to walk a mile into town for pizza and cold drinks. As much as we crave food from these towns, on the hot days, a cold drink is treasured. We finished our day with continued climbs. However, right as we were about to make it into camp, we came upon a convience store offering a grill, pizza, and deli. Again we ate and relaxed before we made it to camp for the evening.","West Mountain Shelter

We left the spiritual life center and considered hiking backwards the half mile to the convience station and deli. We did decide against it, but we are getting spoiled with the food stops. We took a few short breaks throughout the day, but we had motivation to keep moving. Our camp for tonight was within a state park which offered a grill. It was posted that it closed by 4pm. As we got close we gave  up hope of making it there in time. We arrived a quarter after 4, and to our suprise they stayed open late. We have been traveling in a bubble of the same people. It has been fun to see the same faces each night, and cheering each other on throughout the day. It feels as though we all are moving through it together. The campground offered showers, hot ones at that. It felt so good to have the hot water just run over me. After settling in for the night, a man from a couple sites down told us to come down for dinner. Joe, the trail angel, had such a kind heart and was so happy to feed us. He has been doing it for over 10 years and does it all summer. With the forecast of rain, the breeze that moved in brought in cooler temps.

Overnight brought rain, pleasant sleeping rain. As it continued to come down in the morning I peaked at the forecast and, with a pleasant supprise, the system had broken up. What was supposed to be a full day of rain had changed to end by noon. The good news about that was that it meant I turned back over and went back to sleep. If the rain was to continue all day it means you just have to bite the bullet and get up and go. However, with rain ending at noon, you might as well wait it out. After a second snooze we heard another hiker hollering that Joe was brewing coffee. That stirred us. We left camp set up until the rain stopped. We got in another shower while waiting out the weather. Finally we made it out of camp at one. The rain last night brought with it cooler temperatures, and with it brought positive moods. The heat has been so difficult and exhausting, so we celebrated the cool breeze. By the end of the day we even put on our coats.","Fahnestock State Park

We made it out of camp before GQ and met up with him only after we made it to the lunch spot. Native Landscapes, a beautiful plant nursery, opens its buisness to hikers offering drinks and snacks for sell. They offered free outdoor showers; however, with the drop in temperatures a cold shower didn't appeal to us. They offered $5 hot showers and it was worth every penny. The business didn't offer much in the way of food so we made our way to the deli. It was hard to get moving but, as darkness started to creep in, we needed to.

We made a straight shot for town. We took minimal breaks, but the miles came with some difficulty. Altogether we made it to the shelter near 3pm. We set up camp and  finished our chores, that way when we made it back we could just crawl into our tents. Once we made it to the road, we caught a hitch for the mile into town. Conveniently the plaza where the laundry was also had a grocery and chinese restaurant. We all ate our share of food. After dinner we made our way to a coffee shop, where we spent the rest of the evening. The walks to and from towns, although many times not long, can be torturous. Miles off trail just seem wrong. Before leaving the coffee shop, we asked the barista if anyone working would be willing to drive us the mile back to the trail after they closed up.

At lunch, with only 6 miles left, we felt we needed a reprieve. We called all the local hotels and hostels but none offered room. We felt a little defeated but decided we should at least move forward. We made it 3 more miles and decided we needed to call it a night.

The temperature did offer some relief. The biggest motivation and saving grace was a return call from a local hostel owner in which we secured a bunk for the evening and set up a slack pack for the second half of our day. The second half was a breeze and we made it to our pick up location in no time. The Bearded Woods made the list for top hostels on the trail. The luxuries and the little things that the hostel offered really made it stand apart from the rest. Dinner was a treat, GQ had friends who took us out to dinner. It was a nice escape.

The morning routines of the hostel got us up and moving earlier than in weeks. Breakfast was served at 7am and right after they were ready to get us back to the trail. We really enjoyed today. We felt that we finally had an enjoyable day of hiking. The hiking itself had some challenges, however, the conditions and our attitudes were much improved. The temperature was much cooler and there was a breeze that kept us very comfortable. As I had mentioned in the past, the high temps and humidity have been so draining. Another plus to these conditions were the lack of bugs. The bugs have been relentless and rather annoying. The reprieve from the bugs was enough to lift anyone's spirit. We hiked past the town of Salisbury and stopped for a bite to eat. The town was cute and filled with shops and cafes. A place I could easily be sucked into. We hiked out nearly 8 more miles. We had a decent steady climb up offering beautiful views. Many times with the elevation comes the incredible views, and that is something that excites me to start hitting higher peaks again. Today, Bear Mountain was our first peak over 2000 ft in several hundreds of miles. We are thankful for the day and thankful for the renewal of excitement for the trail. A funny story from today was after passing several day hikers, always exchanging a wide variety of pleasantries, a hiker close behind us brought a couple to our attention. He asked if when we passed we had much interaction and we said, ""No more than a hello and have a good day."" The hiker then tells us as he was approaching the lady, before she had made contact with him, said ""They must have been homeless or something."" He then went onto explain that when she saw him and realized most likely that he had heard, she blushed and hid her face. Now this isn't the first time homelessness has been projected on us. I just always find it hysterical. Most every hiker has money and a good bit of it to afford to be out here. Some even are paying mortgages on their homes while they live out here. However, the concept of what we are doing is so foreign to some people, the only reasonable explanation to them is homelessness.","Falls Village

After two weeks we were ready for a zero. On town days we seem to fly down the trail. We typically try and make it in for a late lunch, and that we did. We made it to our hotel, in which we had a horrible experience. Although a trail town, and open to hikers, they were less than pleased to have us. They treated us poorly from the moment we walked in the door. It opened my eyes to those who are treated poorly simply because of a discriminatory mindset. They treated us poorly because we were hikers, judging us based on their assumptions of what we are. The term hiker trash is commonly used among hikers, and although it may sound offensive, it's an endearing term. It means you have made it as a hiker, that you have stooped to a lower standard of living. Now that may sound bad on the surface, but out here it's survival. What does hiker trash look like? Well showering in a spigot you find in a cemetery, using the soap left in the shower stall before you, choosing a restaurant based on Wi-Fi and electrical outlets, or being mistaken as homeless. Now these actions may seem offensive but it is life out here. To those who pass judgement first, i.e. the hotel owner, we might be treated as less. However, hikers are some of the kindest, most generous and respectful people I have met. Some have earned a bad reputation for all, but before judging hiker trash by its cover, or anyone for that matter, give them a chance. Off my soap box; although our service was less than desirable, we enjoyed our time of relaxation. The town community center hosted a community feed. Originally intended for those who are under privileged, they also warmly welcomed hikers. It was a neat experience meeting locals and sharing a meal with them.
We spent most of our time in town resting and watching movies, no better way to spend a zero.","Laurel Ridge Campsite

The day was full of promise, but actually was rather disappointing. It was hot and humid and the bugs were vicious. We were trekking along and all of a sudden we see a familiar face. We stopped and talked for a second and luckily he said, ""So you are headed south today?"" We weren't, or at least we weren't supposed to be. We had somehow, a half a mile before, made a loop and started following the blazes south. As we approached it a second time, it was easy to see where we got turned around. Our first milestone of the day was Ice Gulch, described as having ice and snow even through summer. It was dried up and showed no sign of ice or anything cool for that matter. We reached the second milestone known as the Ledges. One might think a series of overlooks and great views. However, it was one small ledge and if you strained you might be able to see something considered as view. We made it to the shelter and met a man who had been Thru-Hiking up to this point. The next morning he was catching a plane to Madrid and taking on the Camino de Santiago. He had gotten out of the trail all he needed. We have seen several leave recently, and it always remains a shock, especially at this point. Some leave for injury, others bordem, money running out, or they simply got out of the trail all they had hoped.","Great Barrington

Today was a race against the rain. Not only a race against the rain, but a race against the others trying to stay out of the rain. We have been within a rather large bubble of hikers. The bubble refers to a group of common hikers you find your self near and trekking with over the course of the week or weeks. At times you may find you are in a small bubble, feeling as though you aren't seeing many other hikers. Other times it seems as though you are in a large migration. Today we were in a rather large bubble, and everyone had the same location in mind, Upper Goose Pond. This shelter is maintained by a caretaker, and has an actual enclosed cabin for sleeping. Now this is a primitive cabin, but offers a roof and that is more than you can ask for on a rainy night. There was limited space, nearly 20 bunks. Fortunately, although we don't seem to be early risers, we are fast hikers. We made it into the cabin and claimed 3 of the last few bunks. Within minutes of arriving the remaining bunks were claimed. The best part was that we beat the rain. Wherever there are large groups it tends to be a party. Not the wild party with drinking or drugs, but late nights, loud games and lots of laughs. This is fun for a while, but often time we feel old and out of place. We are much more content cozied up reading a book or having conversation. At times we find others with similar feelings and those are the ones we hang around until it's time for bed. Man do we feel old. We discussed that although this large bubble can be fun and has an energy about it as well as a unity amoung it's members spurring each other on, it can also be tiring. After a few nights or a week of this, we are ready to seek solitude, away from the masses.","Mt Wilcox

Today did not go as planned, but in a good way. We woke up early because coffee and pancakes were being served at 630am. The caretaker at the cabin was an angel serving pancakes until everyone had their fill. We left earlier than we have in weeks. The trail was easy on us. We took a mid day break at the Cookie Lady's house. Marilyn Wiley, a gift to the trail, owns a home just off the trail, and she always has cookies on hand for hungry hikers. She also had to help Kyle get back to a package he had shipped that got delayed. It gave us all an enjoyable midday break. After cookies, lemonade, lunch and ice cream sandwiches, we were ready to tackle the end of the day. We made it to the shelter, which was filled, and there were no tenting spots to be found. We left the shelter with town in the back of our minds. Town was 2.5 miles away, but we headed out for a campsite less than a half a mile. We made it to the site, which was undesirable. With just enough day light left, we decided town was the best solution. In town, a local, Tom Levardie, opens his yard for tenting. We made it in at last light. We cooked dinner and walked into town for a night cap. Not a bad way to end a 20 mile day.","Upper Goose Pond

After making the push into Dalton, we had 9 easy miles into Cheshire. Dalton was one of the most friendly trail towns. We started our morning with free showers offered at the community center. It was similar to a YMCA, so not only were there showers, but a sauna as well. Never did I picture that I would find myself relaxing in a sauna on the trail. I spent a good deal of time in there and in the shower. We left town after lunch and made it to Chesire  for dinner. What more could you ask for in a hiking day.","Dalton

We had a relaxed morning. Because we pushed the miles and made it into Cheshire last night, we were able to relax and wait on GQ's friend Ryan to arrive. We had some sprinkles and grey skies, but all weather was to pass by 1pm. So we decided why chance it, we would just wait to start our hike until then. We made our way to breakfast before heading out to hike. Near 1pm we headed for the trail, doing a keyswap. Kyle and I took the car to Greylock summit while GQ and Ryan hiked North to the top. The views and the memorial up top were beautiful. The mountains are changing, no more ridges, but peaks and valleys. We are starting to see the elevation again.  We did encounter a short but heavy pocket of rain during our hike. Although we got wet, we dried out by the end of our hike. After an easy slack pack day with short miles, we made our way to a hotel over night.","Chesire

We had a late night last night catching up with Ryan, getting a few chores done and watching movies. So we were slow to get moving this morning. Our intentions were to make it up the mountain and hike the 6 miles down to meet another one of Gq's friends for lunch. However,  we never made it up the mountain. So after rolling out of bed and checking out of the hotel near noon, we headed straight for lunch. After lunch we made it out to hike. Kyle and I started in North Adams, and hiked south to the summit of Mt Greylock. The ascent from the south is steep at times, but we made it up without much difficulty.
We had hopes that after completing the 6 mile slack pack we would somehow make it 7 more miles. However, we completed the first miles late and we were losing light quickly. We made it just 2 miles where we found camping and water. Rather than race the light, we settled at two miles and made camp.","Mt Greylock

We set out with some ambition, we have 3.5 days to make up the 5 miles we didn't hike yesterday. We came up with a plan to tack them on to two of our shorter days. Today was originally going to be a 12, but with the added miles we made it a 15. Today brought with it crossing into Vermont and the 1600 mile mark. Vermont has been kind so far, offering some muddy, but not rocky terrain. The biggest question of our day was where to camp. We had a water source in mind, however, we wanted to move forward by at least two miles. Our guide books didn't offer any camping past the water source for several miles, but many times along the trail you will find just enough space for a tent or two. This was our hope, a stealth spot, it is called. We made it just nearly the two extra miles and found a doable spot, but felt by chance we could do better. We decided to hike on and, at the summit of Harmonn Hill off a side trail that lead to the Vista point, we found two perfect spots. These are the spots we have seen and envied throughout the trail. We made camp and started dinner just before the sprinkles of rain got to us. Our view from our private Vista was short lived as the rain took over the valley. We retreated to our tents hoping that, with a forecast for clear skies tomorrow, we will get to enjoy the view as first light wakes up the valley floor.","Sherman Brook

Vermont has brought with it joys, beauty, views and lots of mud. Vermont is home to the Long Trail, a nearly 300 mile trail stretch from Vermont to Canada. We share the trail for 105 miles, and the Long Trail served as one of the inspirations for the AT. Because of the increased use, the age of this section of trail and weather conditions, the trail has seen wear. The trail is muddy with deep ruts. We have found ourselves deep in the trenches and covered in mud. We have rock hoped over mud puddles and found ourselves playing a continuous game of ""the trail is lava."" Vermont has however blessed us with beautiful forests. Pine trees, full and lush greenery, rivers and elevation with views. We have spent so many miles ridge walking or at low elevation. The climbs have lead to viewless summits. Since we have crossed the state line, our climbs have rewarded us with views and we have been noticing the elevation as we look out onto the adjacent mountains. With the summit of Greylock, we reached 3000 feet again and have continued to hover above or around these higher elevation. We have anticipated these elevations and all that comes with it. The challenge of these climbs are stimulating. There are only more climbs and higher elevation ahead of us. The saying goes, ""With only 30% of the trail left, we have 70% of the work ahead of us."" This is intimidating, but also exciting. The shelters and camping areas in this area are also of high use. We did find some unique spots to lay our heads at night. Kid Gore had spots overlooking the valley, with sunset casting a beautiful light over the floor. We slipped and slid our way into Manchester covered in mud. We had reservations for a hostel, but they suggested we eat and shop in town before getting picked up. The touristy town with outlets and fine dining seemed a little high class as we walked in mud covered. However, we found some giant burritos and food to take back with us to the hostel. Green Mountain House Hostel came highly recommend. They are a hostel who knows hikers and our needs. The hostel felt homey and comfortable and I couldn't be more happy to call it home for the next two nights.
Our last little surprise came at Kid Gore. Stoic, our friend who traveled with us through the Shenandoah, had gotten ahead of us by several days. We had lost hope that we would see him anytime soon. As we came around the corner, no other than Stoic was sitting there at the table. We were excited to see him again and learn that our plan lined up for the next several nights, putting us in the hostel together. There are plenty of people out here, and the trail is a social one, but those who make it into your tramily, those who you connect with, those people are few.","Harmon Hill

We made it out of Vermud. The northern section of Vermont has been better maintained and very beautiful.  Vermont is preparing our legs, and getting them back in shape to climb. Over the last several days we have seen long climbs, and higher elevation. Mount Killington was our first 4000 foot peak since being in the north. As you may remember from previous posts, we share this section of the AT with the Long Trail. It has brought with it wonderful people, and a neat dynamic. We traveled with a few long trailers off and on since the start of Vermont, and the beginning of their trail. We parted ways at the Maine junction. This is where they turn towards Canada and we continue on towards Maine, as always. At the junction letters of encouragement were exchanged, well wishes, and good bye.
Throughout Vermont the trail has taken us through several ski resorts. In the summer they are closed, good of snow, and quite. They have been fun to go through, almost as if we are in an amusement park after hours. Our night on Killington peak, offered a beautiful sunset. The lodge, or shelter really, sets nearly 200 feet below the summit, but a steep blue blaze gets you to the top. We carried food up and ate dinner watching the sunset from 4000 feet. The shift to a night sky was also something to behold. With little light pollution we saw the stars pop out, and the milky way was in clear view. It has been a long time since I have seen stars so clearly and beautiful. The town of Killington offered a nice little reprieve. After a shorter mileage day, we made it to the one restaurant in town, the Irish pub. The owner Murry was is working, and what a great guy. He told us stories and the history of the place. After listening to the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy sound track throughout the morning, we made our way into this pub, and somewhat felt transported into shire. The pub was built around massive boulder and stone, so the building had a cave like feeling. Murray also informed us the pub was the first place in all of Vermont to sell Guinness and Bailey's. The beef stew fed the soul. We continued on through town to a property that is primarily known as a wedding venue, however, through the week the owner opens it up to hikers. It is a large lodge with ample space to hangout, and we happened to be one of the few there. It felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The other hikers who did stay at the lodge requested a 6:30am breakfast. I don't know if you have gather by this point, that is not quite our speed. However, it was our one shot for breakfast so we drug ourselves out of bed. We ate breakfast, and then did what we refer to as the Mark Safford Special, and went back to bed for the next few hours. We made it out in surprising good time all considering, by 10:30 am we made our way to the trail. It was a 16 mile day and a challenge.

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578503,"Thank you for you sticking with us in this period of inactivity. Within these next several post you will notice some of the destinations and mileages are missing. I forgot to get that bit of info before I sent portions of our data book home. However, it has been way too long between updates, and unwanted to get the stories to you. So without further ado....
We are finally to the section of trail that has the most anticipation. It seems to have the highest anxiety surrounding it, is the most challenging section, but maybe one of the most beautiful. If you ever start digging into information on the Appalachian Trail, you will here about, The Whites. The White Mountains stretch 100 miles and include many of our highest peaks on the trail. The climbs and the terrain then further complicate the peaks. The beginning of The Whites for a Northbounder, starts with Mount Moosiluake. Looking at the elevation profiles in the companion is enough to send anyone into a panic. The elevation is a nearly 4000 foot climb over four miles. The north end of the mountain is notably steep, and known to be slick and a dangerous decent. The Hikers Welcome Hostel, sits less than 5 miles from the summit, and they offer to slack pack hikers. They suggest to slack it south, to climb up the more tretorous route. Even without packs it was intimidating. We set out and although steep and challenging, it wasn't nearly as bad as anticipated. The North side follows a cascading waterfall nearly most of the way. As we near the summit, we break tree line. This is anotber feature distinct to the White Mountains, many of the mountain tops are above tree line. Immediately after crossing tree line, we were reminded how cold it can be at these higher elevation, and with no protection from the wind. We quickly started layering up. It was at the hostel that we had all our winter gear sent back to us. Yes, that's right winter gear in August. As we reached the tree line and made our final push to the summit, we were just blown away by the views. As far as the eye can see are mountains. We could see where we came from over the last few days, and where we were headed. Even with just this one view, I wouldn't not be disappointed by the hype. However, I know this is just the beginning of the views that lay ahead.
It was time for us to enter this big world of the whites on our own. No more slackpacking. We set out with a goal of 12 miles. The suggestions are to not push much past 12 miles. The miles will take you longer because they are tough. And they sure were. Our twelve miles took us 8 hours, a very slow pace for us. We had two major accents, and arguably the toughest climb of the whites. Mount Wolfe, although looked like chump change tucked in between two 4000 footers, it was quite the challenge. Especially the decent, which is where our pace really started to suffer. The one mile decent took us over an hour. As soon as we hit level ground after our decent, we went straight back up. Our climb up to Kinsman was less of hiking and more of climbing. We often times were using our arms to hoist ourselves and packs up huge boulders. The challenge was rewarded as we reached the top again the views were outstanding. The sun was getting lower in the sky and casting beautiful light on the surrounding mountains. With the lack of trees at the summits of these mountains, when the light hits the rocks they just glow. Today was hard, nearly one of our hardest. It wasn't hard in that we haven't seen any of the challenges that today brought, but more so that the challenges didn't cease. If you weren't  climbing straight up, you were boulder scrambling, playing the trail is lava, balancing on logs and roots, or trying not to free fall down the mountains on your decent. However even with the challenges, today might have just been one of my favorite days. The challenge was fun and the scenery made it all worth it.","

If we have learned anything it is that the White Mountains are no joke. After our day on Kinsman, we welcomed a short mileage day. We woke up at nearly above 3000 feet and found out why they suggest that you have your winter gear in the Whites no matter the season. It's August and we reached lows in the 30's. Getting moving in the morning is difficult for our group, but it's compounded further by the cold. After a late start, we made it a couple miles to our first hut. Huts in the Whites are a mystery, at least they were to us. There is so much information floating around about the huts, it's hard to know what to believe. So this was our first time to really feel one out, and get the scoop for ourselves. The huts are really designed for section or weekend hikers. They offer bunk spaces for $120 plus a night per person, including breakfast and dinner. It's rather primitive, running water, but no electricity in the bunk space, no showers, it is a place to lay your head and provided shelter at high elevations. For thru-Hiker, they are bit too expensive, but are good for a few things. Potable water and snacks are the biggest bonuses. Each day the hut will have daily homemade baked goods, coffee, and soup, which for $5 you can have all three. The soups hit the spot in the mood of a cold hiking day. Although huts cater to section hikers, they do look out for thru-hikers. At some huts, especially those well above tree line, and in bad weather, huts will not turn a thru-hiker away. What happens is a few differnt things. One you work for stay, meaning you do a small amount of work, get left over food for breakfast and dinner, and sleep on the floor. Another option is they may offer the rooms at a deep discount, or allow you to pay a small fee to sleep on the floor. So although we were not looking to stay at the hut, we got the scoop so that we could plan better heading forward. We did however get some free beef and rice leftovers, coffee, and baked goods. If you remember back to our tramily of six you will remember Glampress and Torque. We hiked with them through Virginia, before they pulled ahead, took sometime off trail, and flip flopped. So they have been heading south and we have been anticipating our reunion with them. It just so happened as we were planned our schedules we all were headed Liberty Springs the same night. The reunion was wonderful, to catch up with these ladies  we spent so much time with. Some of these relationships on the trail will be lasting, they are part of our story, they are like family.","

We have started into a section of the Whites known as the Presidentials. These are the mountains with names of you guessed it, presidents. Mt Washington, the biggest and baddest that gets most of the attention, but the Franconia Ridge sitting at 5,000 feet, made its running for my favorite day on trail so far. The ridge spends 2.5 miles above tree line and the views are breath taking. As you acend, the first of 3 peaks, you can see the, next two ahead of you. You see the path as it winds its way up to the next rocky peak. As you get to the last of the 3 peaks you see for miles. You can look back on where you came from and where you are headed. As far as the eye can see are mountains, layers and layers of ridges. The foremost mountains are green covered in pine trees, but as the layers go back they have silhouettes of blues and grays. Within a gap between nearly two thousand feet of decent into the gap, and another two thousand out, lay Galehead Hut. We were told of possible stealth camping options if we got to the hut and they could not accommodate us. Work for stays are limited, and a spot at the  hut was not guaranteed. We made it in near 6pm as the guests were sitting for dinner. Our hopes for work for stay were low, but to our surprise, they allowed us to, and put us on breakfast crew. So we spent the evening relaxing in the hut, ate leftover thanksgiving dinner, and slept inside out of the cold.
The following morning our work for stay consisted of sweeping out the bunk rooms, fluffing pillows, and folding unfolded blankets. Pretty simple and all in all we were out and on the trail by 9:30, an early start than most mornings. We had some concerns about our day. We planned for a 14 mile day, which can push our limits for the whites. We had some insight that we had several miles within the day that were easy, and we should be just fine. We also had reservations at a lodge with an all you can eat dinner waiting for us at the end. The day gave us some challenge, but also gave us some breaks. We had 5 miles of as flat as flat can get in the Whites, with little to no obstacles. Our climb was done and over with early after we ascended twin peaks first thing. The view from twins has mount Washington front and center. It was the first clear view, of the grandeur of the mountain. It sits at just over 6,000 feet and has a base stretching nearly 20 miles. As we sat face to face, we took in that we would meet just tomorrow. What looked like worlds away was just a day of hiking away.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578508,"We toyed around with how to make today a slack pack. The 11 miles up to Mt Washington and 4000 feet of elevation gain was a little intimidating. As push came to shove and we pulled out all the stops, we decided to carry on as normal. We loaded our packs on our backs and headed up. The climb out of Crawford Notch was no joke, and we quickly realized it would have been too many miles and too little time to make it to the summit. This climb along with so many others in the Whites, have required us to put the trekking poles away and use our arms to pull ourselves up. Without the time crunch we could take a relaxed pace. We made a lunch stop at Mitzpa Hut. We are loving these mid day hut stops, where we get a hot bowl of soup and baked goods. It warms us, it fills our bellies, and recharges us to take on the next section of trail. After lunch, the trail gave us a little break, the trail was not as intense, and gave us views the rest of the way. We broke tree line, and with clear skies, the views were endless. We also were able to keep our eyes on Mt. Washington, and see it get closer and closer. We stopped for the evening at Lake of the Clouds Hut. As we had been told, they can't turn hikers away. The terrain and trail are too difficult before and after, and there is no where to retreat below treeline. The problem however, is we weren't really sure how it would work out, just that we should have shelter. There seemed to be a mad dash to the hut as everyone we came in contact with that day was headed to the hut as well. We made it in and there were only 3 work for stays left. This meant a free stay and dinner. Those coming in after us could stay, but would have to pay and no dinner. Hut nights are long, after the paying guests end dinner around 8:30, we finally got to eat the leftovers, and quickly. After dinner we do about 30 to 40 minutes of chores, and then at 9:30 after they turned the lights off, we are allowed to set up our sleeping pads on the floor. However, when sleeping at 5000 feet above tree line, lows in the 20s and on a mountain that is known for some of the worst weather conditions in the world, we were thankful to be indoors.","

Because we had to be out of the dinning area by 6:15am, we had our earliest trail start to date. We made it to the Summit of Washington and were the first ones of the day. We had the summit to ourselves, and without and cloud in the sky. Mt. Washington is known to have over 50% of its days completely clouded in. We celebrated at the summit sign and rather quickly retreated into the visitor's center, where we stayed for the next 3 hours. Although a beautiful day it was in the high 30s. The earliest visitors arrive is near 10am as the auto road doesn't open until 9, and the first train to come up departs the valley at 9. So the hikers who made our way up to the summit early had the place to ourselves. After leaving the summit, I quickly wanted to turn back. The first half of the decent wasn't steep, but it was a constant rock scramble. It took all your focus to watch your feet hit each rock and look for your next move. The second half wasn't much better, but before tackling it, we had soup. The decent down Madison, to finish the presidentials was steep and rocky. It took a reframing of our minds, we were no longer hiking, rather we were bouldering. Looking at it differently and trying to just enjoy it and have fun with it, was the best we could do. Honestly it helped. We made it down Madison without much trouble, but thankful to be done. We finally dipped back below tree line for the first time in a day and a half. But not before catching a glimpse of what is to come, The Wildcats.","

Within our first few miles today we made it to one of the White Mountain Lodge. We wanted to stay, however, by stopping it would have created an odd division of mileage moving forward. We also saw the climb out of the notch from the road, and it did not look pleasant. Wildcat rises 2500 feet in just under 2 miles. Wildcat is also a ski mountain and has a gondola. So we came up with the idea to leave our packs at the lodge, climb the mountain packless, and ride the gondola back down. Not only was it a major help to us physically, but it was such a fun experience. We also convinced a handful of others that it was a good idea, so 10 of us had this fun afternoon.

The threat of the clouds matched the buzz that we were hearing about the weather all morning. The Whites receives its weather report from the observation area of Mt Washington. Standing the tallest of all the mountains, and known for record setting weather and winds, the forecast coming from Washington were a little frightening. After our beautiful but chilly Washington summit, just a few days later called for rain, sleet, snow, wind gusts of 70 mph, and dropping temps. The park at ""The peaks"" as the rangers called it were on standstill. They advised those who had reservations at the peaks to not attempt. Looking out from the comfort of our lodge looking at the skies, I wanted to stay. Although the storms had not started in the valley, the clouds over the mountains were dark. However, we set out. We figured let's test out ""The peaks"" and if it was bad we would turn around. As we took the gondola back up to where we got of the trail last night, we rode into the clouds. The weather was mild, there wasn't much wind, and the temps hadn't dropped much. So we moved forward. We made it without little to no rain, and all day we seemed to chase sunshine just off in the distance. It was a time I was reminded of all the negative talk surrounding the day and the weather, you often times have to take it in and either test it out or make your own decision. This holds true over and over again on the trail. There is so much talk and everyone has their opinions, and frankly quite a bit of fear mongering. We made it to camp with no problems and was thankful that the guys pushed us to get out of the lodge. Overnight is when the winds really started picking up and hearing the winds tear through the trees and beat against the shelter, caused me to retreat furhter into my sleeping bag. With the winds, came the temperature drop and by morning it was cold. I was layered in nearly every piece of clothing. The peaks we got over today were cold. The wind that came across was enough to take your breath away. Luckily after we made it back below tree line although the wind still persisted, we were protected. We made our way into White Mountain Hostel, where we would stay for a nearo and zero. The hostel was full and where many hikers gather can frankly be a little overwhelming. After the initial funneling of hikers into the hostel, it became more relaxed. We enjoyed, the relaxation, movies, and food. We also just happened to arrive when the hostel was throwing a labor day party, which included more food, a DJ, karaoke, and bonfire. Others of us took to some serious board game action. With the whites behind us, our zero was much appreciated and so deserved. Our bodies were ready.","

We have great talent of leaving after a zero into the rain. The morning started well and as the drizzle started, we lost all motivation. The winds and rain were cold on the balds, and  we called it for the day. By one we had made camp and never left our tents. It's not often that we don't keep moving in rain, but today was one of those days. One might think how terrible to be holed up in a tent all afternoon and evening, but honestly it is one of my favorite days. We napped, we read, ate, and rested. So we had some miles to make up after residing early yesterday. However, the terrain is rough, the climbs are frequent, and the rocks and slabs are down right dangerous. We made it 10 miles and we were already pushing dark. As you can imagine this is not the terrain for night hiking. So we hadn't made it where we had hoped for the night, but with sunset we decided it was time to call it at the next shelter. With half a mile to go, we have to come down a steep rock face. These places make me sick to my stomach. We got down to the bottom only to find a friend, that had fallen down the rocks, and was waiting for a rescue team to get him off the mountain. It was there his Thru-Hike ended. He made it off the mountain by helicopter, and only with a few sprains. It was sobering as we are now in Maine, and arguably the most difficult section, the trail continues to knock people off. We feel invincible, we have come over 1900 miles, but it's not over until it's over. Southern Maine I say is arguably the most difficult section, and frankly underestimated. The White Mountains are tough, no doubt, the climbs are massive, and the terrain is not easy, but southern Maine is unrelenting. The mountains of southern Maine are a series of granite rock faces, and large boulders the sizes of houses and cars, that you must find your way over or under. It also doesn't seem to matter if it rained the day before or a week ago, they are always slick. Our pace slowed to under a mile an hour at times, and as much as we were physically drained we were mentally drained. Every move was calculated, and you couldn't loose focus for a minute or you would miss your step. Southern Maine holds the famous Mahoosuc Notch, a one mile boulder field, with massive house size boulders, that hikers have to climb their way through. It has been known to take hikers upwards of 4 hours to complete this one mile section. Before going into this section we had to reframe it, we are no longer hiking, we are on a rock jungle gym, let's have fun with it. This is where you put away your trekking poles, and start using your hands to pull yourself up, and your butt to slide down. It was fun, we laughed, we said a few ""how in the worlds,"" we fell a few times, we crawled, we went up and over, and down and underneath. However, it was tiring. After the first hour, the upper body muscles that have been neglected for the last 5 months had their work cut out. We over all finished the notch in one hour and forty minutes. However, the work didn't stop there. The climb up the Mahoosuc Arm, is a granite rock face, climbing 2000 feet. We were spent, and our climb was slow. I was thankful to be a northbounder and climbing up this face. Those going south were slipping and skidding their way down. We made it into camp completely wiped.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578522,"Southern Maine is hard, and we wanted to make it better. So we decided to start a slack packing adventure. We needed to get through the last of the real elevation, the last of the 4000 ft plus mountains until Katahdin. We could make the push, and our bodies would appreciate it so much more without 30 pounds on our backs. So we started with a pack pick up from Pine Ellis at Grafton Notch. From here we would carry on up over Baldpate for a pick up and a stay in the hostel. As the gentleman picked up our packs, he warned us and asked us to think twice about the attempt up Baldpate, with the rain. He said, "" the only thing you will have to hold onto is your hair."" We carried on anyway. It was a series of granite rock slabs, with nothing to pull yourself up with or to hold onto, but we made it up without much difficulty. It was really a beautiful mountain and the exposed area above tree line, gave us amazing views into the valleys. It also seemed as though the weather was contained more to the valleys than the peaks. The rocks were wet, but it never actively rained on us. From there Pine Ellis helped us slack pack for the next two days over several more series of mountains, and difficult days. Our final day with Pine Ellis they moved our bags forward to Rangley, where we had reservations at another hostel, The Farmhouse. They would carry on as we continued slack packing. The Farmhouse is in a transition to become a wedding venue, so the grounds, and rooms were beautifully done. We were a little spoiled there. They slacked us over Saddleback Mountain, a series of peaks and valleys, with over 3 miles of alpine zone. It was a cloudy morning and as we reached the top of saddle back we were completely clouded in. There was a fine mist, and the wind tore across the exposed areas. Needless to say we were darting though. We made it down the first series of peaks and made into junior saddle back, where we looked back and saw the clouds had lifted, and Saddleback was completely clear. Although slightly disappointing that we missed a clear summit, it offered a beautiful sight.
We carried on further and the Farm House took our packs to their property in Stratton, as we hiked forward, up over Crocker Mountain. With one last day ahead, and our last 4000ft mountains, we slacked with the help of Stratton Inn up over the Bigelows. The weather could not have been more perfect. The peaks of the Bigelows offer 360 views. From there you can see the Whites, and on a clear day catch a glimpse of Katahdin. We did have clear skies, and could see for miles, and felt we might have seen the mountain way out there standing alone. Finishing this section for me felt like accomolishment. I have every desire to reach the Katahdin sign, but there is so much of me that is already celebrating. To me, we have done it, we are 2000 milers. Everything in between here and Katahdin feels like bonus time. With two weeks left, the end couldn't be any more clear.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578531,"We made it back into the woods on our own with full packs. However, just for one night. Northern Maine,  hovers for the most part between 500 feet and 1500 feet. The profile appears flat. However, history has shown, flat is not always flat, and not always easy. This section however, has been a breeze. We can finally stretch the legs a little and make good strides. We don't have to calculate each step. It's been beautiful skirting along streams and ponds, and really very enjoyable. For our one night out we found a peaceful stealth site right along a stream. We made camp, and enjoyed a fire. The following day we had 6 miles to make it into Caratunk where we would officially rest and zero. The long mile pushes through southern Maine, and the early mornings were enough to have us begging for a zero. Just before reaching Caratunk, you take the official white blaze ferry across the Kennebec River. The river is wide, and rushing, and has had several drownings of those trying to cross. Therefore, the ATC, created the official route to be by ferry, or canoe across the river. A certified white water instructor, mans the river crossing with a canoe and ferries hikers across. Caratunk doesn't offer much but, the BandB is a little piece of paradise. Walking to the house, the homes surrounding are so run down, and we began to question where we were staying. However, the BnB is in an old Victorian home, with private rooms, and each room uniquely done. Paul takes such pride in his home and it shows. He also has a very well stocked resupply, milkshakes that are to die for, and pulled pork sandwiches. So although not much, it is all you could want. Another bonus, down the road, the outdoor center offers free rides to their brewery and restaurant. They also give hikers use of their hot tub. Needless to say we are pretty happy hikers.","

So as you may remember I said we have already begun to celebrate the end. Although we have reason and cause for celebration, the end is not here just yet. We were reminded of this on this section. If you have heard the term senioritis, when seniors start to check out and loose motivation. Well it happens with thru-hikers as well. This section of trail has one mountain, and the rest is referred to as the ""super highway"". With talks of this section we stepped out with excitement to quickly find we had no motovation. The first day and a half and the climb up the mountain was frankly annoying, and our energy levels were zapped. The talks of how great this section was did not meet our anticipation. However we made it, and arrived in Monson. The last town before the 100 mile wilderness. Shaw's Hostel lies right in town Monson, and we have been looking forward to our stay here since Trail Days. At Trail Days, they hosted a hiker feed. Free to hikers, and served full plates of salad, pasta, desert, and wine. We knew we liked this place. Previous Thru-Hikers themselves, they get hikers, and having spent so much time in the area, they answer all the questions hikers may have about the wilderness, and about their end at Katahdin. At this point hikers are anywhere from 6-10 days from the completion of their hike. Shaw's sits in a unique place to prepare and ready hikers for those final days.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578533,"So one interesting fact about the 100 mile wilderness, is that it's not actually remote and void of roads or civilization. The signs as you approach the wilderness do warn hikers that the next 100 miles, is void of roads, and no one should enter without at least 10 days of food. First that is a load of malarkey. There are several roads to access the wilderness from all different mile marks. The only problem is that they may not directly lead you to any town or major road. However Shaw's knows the wilderness and they get slack packing, and as you know we love slack packing. The first 45 miles of the wilderness are considered the tougher sections. The first 15 miles although appear flat by the profile, really are a lot of little ups and downs. To add to it, the terrain is just what we were warned about in the wilderness. A lot of roots, and a lot of rocks. Day two has a series of peaks called the Chairbacks, with steep ups and downs, which are not forgiving. Shaw's offered a two day slackpacking to get you past this section. Naturally we took them up on that. At the end of the second day, rather than going back to the hostel our bags were brought to us and we stayed in the woods. Not only did this plan help us avoid carrying packs over this section, it allowed us to break up the amount of food we had to carry at once. When our bags were brought forward, we only had to carry 2.5 days of food before we would reach our next destination.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578535,"The last and final mountain of the trail until Katahdin, Whitecap. Our first day out with packs into the wilderness we made it up and over the series of climbs to reach Whitecap. From the peak, Katahdin lies right in front of you. Liner, it is only 28 miles away. However, as the AT goes, it's 72 miles, go figure. Leaving Shaw's I walked away with a much different attitude than I walked in. Walking in, I had ""senioritis"". Leaving, and discussing our timeline, I wanted to pump the brakes a little. We are one week from finishing, and seeing the mountain right in front of us was so surreal. A day, a mountain, a moment we have be working for not just for six months, but for years, lay 28 miles north. As I sat and took it in, at that moment I was thankful for the 72 trail miles that were between me and the mountain.  After Whitecap, the trail seemed to take mercy on us. The trail flattened and for the most part felt just like a walk in the park. Roots weren't trying to reach up and grab you by the ankle. Rocks weren't trying to wedge your feet and trip you. Trail stretched out in front of you for as far as the eye could see.
Our second day out we did a 16 mile day, and for the first time in months we knocked out a 3 mile an hour pace all day. We made it to camp before sunset and had time to enjoy the evening. What a beautiful evening it was. When people picture us camping in our tents, I feel it gets romanticized. People picture the most beautiful camp spots, sunset views on one side, and sunrise on the other. Most of the time that is nowhere near the truth but tonight it was. We camped on the bank of a lake, on a pensula. We swam, ate dinner watching the sunset, and clear view of the stars. Never could I have dreamt of a spot like this.","

Jordan and Kyle Carter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578650,"Our final stretch of trail. We woke up to the most beautiful sunrise, casting bright red and pink light into our tent. We watched the sun rise, and bring the world to life as it spread across the lake. We did however, fall back asleep before taking on the day. Before calling it a night last evening, we checked for service and with two tiny little bars we got the news that dad was in Maine. He couldn't wait to get out to us, and it just happened to be perfect timing. We had plans to hike the 6 miles into White House Landing Hostel. It lies within the 100 mile wilderness and by AT can only be reached by boat. However, it can be reached by gravel road as well. So luckily, we were able to rendezvous. After searching and searching we found that in order to see and hike with dad in the days moving forward, the only option was to have him hike out with us and then turn around and hike back. So the first day out from White House Landing, dad was able to experience the 100 mile wilderness, by hiking out 5 miles, where we stopped for a lake side lunch, before he headed back. The interesting bit was that we were anticipating a 15 mile day, and after we made it to the lake, 5 miles in, we realized we still had 15 miles ahead of us to our intended camp spot. We still haven't realized how this oversight happened, but it was a forgiving 20 mile day. We made it to camp early, and took in our last night in the woods. With dad in town, it was our last night sleeping in the woods. Under the supervision of our eagle scout GQ, I built my first fire of the trail. We shared stories and  reminisced over  the last 6 months together. These are moments I will truly miss. Life tends to creep in and sitting around sharing meals together can easily be pushed out. However, on the trail you share nearly every meal with those closest to you. Breaking bread and fellowship, that is something that is designed within us. In true fashion, we were last out of camp the following morning. We discussed the plans with dad, but didn't know if we would find him at the road for pick up or somewhere along the trail. We had hiked about 5 miles, and received a text from him, that he hit the trail early and was about one mile from us. We met him half way and he turned and hiked back out to the road with us. We hiked to Abol bridge, which put us right at the edge of Baxter State Park. Katahdin is in full view at this time and the end feels so close. From there we piled in the car and made our way back into Millinocket. Although only 20 miles, the drive takes just at an hour. The hotel was a gathering place for many hikers, and because of our slowed pace the last few days, we were able to celebrate the end with several of our friends that came down the mountain. It was such an odd feeling. Although we have heard news of people finishing for the last month, our friends, and those we have hiked with within the last week are now done. Their journey was complete. It felt like the last days of high school or college, the goodbyes, and wishes for good luck in what lie ahead. If it wasn't sinking in already, it was hitting hard. We had two hiking days left as we headed out on a 10 mile section connecting Abol Bridge, to the base of Mt Katahdin. It was beautiful trail within Baxter State Park. Dad came out with us finishing this last bit before the mountain.  Most of the day was spent along the banks of a river, and even featured  Abol Falls. We only had 10 miles, and with it we took our time. All we had to do today was hike these  10 miles. We ate lunch at rivers edge, soaked our feet, and took a swim. These moments are limited. We couldn't help but take one last advantage of a zero. Actually, the timing worked that Arthur would come to meet GQ before the summit, giving us one day of wiggle room, thus a zero. So as we relax and reflect upon this journey, we are but 5 miles from completion. We are ready. We are done. However, the thoughts and emotions remained jumbled. The questions we are asked, ""Was it worth it?"" Well yes absolutely, but why, that is the harder part to answer. ""Did you get out of the trail what you had hoped?"" Well yes, I believe we did, but what that is, it is still out for discovery. It's a moment in life that still hasn't set in. It may feel more final as we reflect at the sign in the sky. However, in some ways, the journey is still ahead as we sort out what this period of our life meant. What we gained, what we lost, and where we go. But, tomorrow we move forward and we reach the summit. A moment 6 months and one week in the making. We are ready but, we are humbled, to be here at this point. To be among the 20% that make it to this moment, to become Thru-Hikers.","
