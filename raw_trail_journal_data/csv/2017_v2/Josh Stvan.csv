Josh Stvan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551034,"Hello,Apparently when you say something out-loud, or read it on the internet, it becomes an undeniable truth.I am attempting a thru-hike of the Appalachian trail in 2017.Whoa.Now that I have written such a monumental step in stone, I have a few things to share about myself, and my plans.Bio:I am merely a man attempting to walk a long way.Itinerary:Ill leave sometime in march.",,Saying it,"Oct 29, Sat",0
Josh Stvan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551035,"Hello,Having read many books, and journals alike on the subject of Thru-hiking, I clearly see everyone has their own reason for being on the trail. There is power in personal impressions, things put on our heart for a reason of which we can either ignore, or accept. The majority of the time these impressions do not meet cultural norms, or expectations of peers. Having said that, putting the expectations of others upon our shoulders and ignoring ones true desires is detrimental to growing into who we truly are made to be.I hope that as we all seek ourselves in this life, we also stop to see how we can change the world for others. The reason I am hiking the trail:To examine myself and how I interact with the world.",,Purpose,"Oct 29, Sat",0
Josh Stvan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551036,"Hello,I have been scouring the web for the best options both weight wise, and price wise for months. Here are a few of my picks. I kept weight at the forefront of my mind when selecting gear.Pack: Osprey Exos 58L: This pack has been great so far, lightweight and great for the price point at $220.Sleep System: EE 10 Degree Revelation quilt: This quilt is lightweight and clearly made with great care, I am excited to use it this coming winter. I sleep fairly cold, and that is why I went with the 10 degree as apposed to a 20 which is a little more common.Tent: Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2: Man this tent has been incredible, lightweight, roomy, well built. Can't wait to call it home.Cook System:Toaks 700ml Pot/BRS Camping stove/Sawyer Squeeze(Regular) When thinking through my cook system I really want to balance comfort and weight, I believe I will be picking up a Sea To Summit Cup for coffee shortly.Hope these few picks help you make some choices for yourself!Goals:Spend less than 1 dollar a mile.This is an accountability goal to keep myself focused on my personal needs more than wants.White Blaze: One Thru-Hiker once told me to decide just how ""Pure"" I wanted to be as a hiker before I hit the trail. I plan on passing every white blaze, even if it feels like death as I approach them.Average 18 miles per day:This number is fueled mostly by my budget, more days on trail, more money spent.",,Gear and Goals,"Oct 29, Sat",0
Josh Stvan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555328,"Hello,As I approach my departure date I am anxious to hit the trail. My current plan is to hike the approach trail on March 5th, we will make camp at the Springer Mountain shelter and depart the next morning making our official start date March 6th! I hope you join me as I embark on an adventure of a lifetime both physically from Georgia to Maine, and emotionally from who I am now to who I will become.","
