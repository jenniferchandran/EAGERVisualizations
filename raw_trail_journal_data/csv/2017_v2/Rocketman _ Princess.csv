Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556676,"We're only about 4 days from kickoff at Springer Mtn. We've been gradually putting things in place for several months and I think we'll be ready. Our basic plan this year is about the same as before: we want to slack-pack as much as possible and this year we plan to take our car along with us (same as last year). It takes some extra work and driving some gravel roads, but it's much more comfortable for us than conventional back-packing and the car takes some of the uncertainty out of relying totally on shuttle drivers.This year we plan to start at the top of Springer. Last year we started at Amicalola Park and climbed the approach trail and we took some cool photos of the falls as we trudged up the endless stairs. But this year we'll drive up to the parking lot near the top and hike about a mile back to the top of Springer - then turn around and start the trek northward.We've made a few changes since last year. I picked up Lyme on my first thru-hike and several weeks of antibiotics appeared to fend it off. The next year I found a bulls-eye and did the doxy regimen again. Last year, late in the season, I found a large tick chewing on me and decided to take doxy as a precautionary measure. We always did daily inspections, but the ticks can be very, very small. This year I decided to send my hiking clothes off to have them pre-treated with Insect Shield. We'll still do the tick checks and I'll wear long clothing as long as I can, but I'm hoping the permethrin will fend off the pests.We also decided to carry a second satellite communicator this year. On some sections Princess and I start at opposite ends and pass each other during the hike. So now when we're hiking alone, each of us will have a communicator in case we run into a problem when the other isn't nearby (and we don't always have phone service). I learned that Garmin has absorbed DeLorme and is changing the hardware, but I was still able to get a DeLorme SE and activate it on the Garmin system. It seems to be working fine. And we picked up the latest version of the AWOL AT Guide in both the hardcopy and PDF version. We particularly like the PDF on our iPhones since almost all of the parking areas have GPS map links that we can use in our car's nav system. And we have the Guthook AT Hiking Guide that also locates the parking spots - including photos. There are also photos of many of the road crossings, trail crossings, shelters, water sources, etc. Slack-packing makes electronics easier to carry since we can recharge them almost every night.",,"Norfolk, VA","Mar 16, Thu",0
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556995,"Our target start date is getting close. We're working on closing out all the loose ends here at home like mail, taxes, utility bills, doctor appts, etc. And getting everything ready to pack along with us. Of course we've had some practice at preparation the last few years, but it's still a challenge. Princess is super organized and her gear is in pretty good shape. I'm not. At least she helped me get things together today and I'm in better shape than I was. We plan to hit the road Tuesday AM, headed toward Georgia and Springer Mountain.Physically we've been working for a couple of months on conditioning. But I certainly don't feel as fit as I have for the past 3 years. We've put in 3 or 4 hours at our local Y every day. But our cardio component hasn't been as intense as before. So our plan is to take it easy and try not to overdo it. It is an endurance event, not a sprint. And the Georgia hills can be quite a challenge if you're not in great shape.",,"Norfolk, VA","Mar 19, Sun",0
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557279,"We left Norfolk later than planned yesterday (Tuesday) and finally arrived in Blue Ridge, Georgia around 10. So we decided to sleep in late today and delay our AT start until Thursday. Yesterday was unusually warm in GA and the heat culminated in a band of severe thunderstorms that swept through Blue Ridge just after dark. It had everything: heavy rains, wind gusts, lightning and hail. Driving through it was nasty, but we were glad that we weren’t in a tent last night.We took advantage of the spare time today to drive to Amicalola Falls and register for the hike. We were #s 1113 and 1114, so a lot of hikers are already on the trail. We didn’t stay long, we took a photo at the stone arch, walked around for a few minutes and then headed back to Blue Ridge. On the drive back we stopped at the North Georgia Mountain Outfitters. We should have stopped there in the past, it has a wide variety of gear and I picked up a couple of things that will be useful on the trail. The owner is an AT hiker and was very helpful.Our last stop was at the grocery where we stocked up on what we think we’ll need for the next few days. I marvel somewhat at the difference between this year’s hike and our first AT hike in 2014. For our first hike, food prep was paramount. We estimated the number of meals that three of us (Ranger was with us) would need for about 6 months of hiking, subtracted the meals we thought we could get at hostels, etc. along the way and then we prepared all the rest. We had a large dehydrator (6 trays I think) and we ran it 24/7 for months. We had breakfasts, lunches, snacks and dinners (24 different types of dinners). All very healthy things. Then all the meals were prepackaged and vacuum-sealed and sorted out into 22 mail-drops along the way. Then we packed each mail-drop in a pre-labeled box along with other expendable supplies (dozens of things) that we expected to need and Alan, our trail boss, mailed 1 or 2 boxes out to us every week or two. It was a great plan and it worked well for several months, but we began to get tired of a steady diet of dehydrated food — even though it was varied. We stumbled on slack-packing somewhere in NC/TN and were doing it more and more in VA. After Harpers Ferry we slack-pack as often as we could. On the second half of the hike we turned into trail angels with all our dehydrated food. Now all we need is a sandwich for lunch, some protein bars, and some nuts. We have breakfast and supper off-trail. It really simplifies things for us.Sorry about nostalgic reminiscence. Our grocery trip today was pretty quick. Then we spent the evening getting our gear ready for an early start tomorrow. We plan to start with an assault on Springer and then we’ll see how far we get.",,"Blue Ridge, GA","Mar 22, Wed",0
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557511,"We’re officially back on the trail. As I described in our “About” entry, we actually started hiking the AT in October and November, 2016 when we hiked the Smokies, from Erwin, TN to Atkins, VA, and from the James River Bridge to Front Royal, VA. So now we’re starting at Springer, filling in the sections in GA, TN, and NC that we missed last fall and then continuing north from Front Royal.Today was a challenge, namely getting back into the hiking routine. Waking up in the dark, remembering everything we need in our packs, making sure the electronics are charged, packing everything in dry-sacks or baggies, etc. We were finally on the road about a half-hour later than planned. The temp was cooler than we expected and there was enough wind to make it really cold, but manageable. We went directly up the long gravel road to the parking lot close to the Springer summit. After parking there, we both climbed the mile or so up to the summit and took the customary photos at the AT terminus marker. The parking lot was about half-filled, but we never saw another hiker on the way up or down from the top. We hoped to find someone at the top to take our photo, instead we ended up taking a shot of each other. Eventually we saw plenty of other hikers, particularly after we started passing the shelters and campgrounds. We’re starting out using a ""key swap"" strategy where Hiker 1 gets out of the car at one end of a section and starts hiking. Hiker 2 then drives to the other end of the section, parks the car and starts hiking back in the opposite direction. So we pass each other somewhere along the section. When Hiker 1 reaches the end of the section, they drive the car back to the beginning and pick up Hiker 2. It sounds complicated, but it’s not really. It does take longer because of the extra driving, but the person who is driving gets a little rest and it’s a good time to drink water and munch a snack. The length of the section we pick is determined by how far we want to hike and the availability of access roads and suitable parking areas along the trail. Sometimes if there are enough access roads, we can break a day into 2 or even 3 sections. So we get to see (pass) each other more often along the trail. The biggest benefit of this strategy is that we don’t have to rely on shuttle drivers. We both have keys so we don’t actually have to swap keys - it would be really bad if a hiker got to the car at the end of their section and didn’t have the key. The trail is in great shape in spite of the volume of hikers that have started this year. The trail is clear and clean. There is some debris on the trail from the storms last night, but not very much. I did encounter one Ridge Runner named Bill and it appears they are working hard to keep the trail in top condition. There seems to be plenty of water in this area, not an abundance - but an adequate supply. Not many photogenic spots along this section of trail, but I’m beginning to recognize a lot of it from previous hikes.","Blue Ridge, GA

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557514,"We had a very special evening yesterday. We learned a couple of days ago that Honey and Bear, a beautiful couple that keep a hostel near Andover, Maine called “The Cabin"" are currently in this area and we managed to arrange an evening with them. Apparently they typically take a winter vacation in FL and this year they are returning through GA. For several years, a thru-hiker named Hopper has been helping them during hiking season and has become a close friend. This year Hopper volunteered to help a paraplegic do a portion of the trail (more about this later). So we made arrangements to meet them in Dahlonega, GA and have dinner there. Princess’ brother (Ranger) and his wife (Gay) joined us - as well as Hopper. Ranger has also stayed at their Maine hostel so it was a great reunion. Both Honey & Bear are veteran hikers, intimately familiar with the rigorous hiking in the Maine and New Hampshire area. For the last 2 years, Bear and Hopper have enabled us to slack-pack most of the way from Gorham to Rangeley (including Mahoosuc Notch). And they have a treasure trove of great stories of all the legendary AT hikers who have passed through their door. So we all had a tremendous time.More about Hopper’s special duty: she signed up to join a team of volunteers who committed to help take Dr. J, a paraplegic, along a part of the AT. Most of the rest of the team are students from the University of Clemson. They have spent the week carrying Dr. J and her gear, as well as their own along the AT here in Georgia. They have camped out every night, including the ferocious thunderstorm that passed through 2 days ago. We met Dr. J and the whole team when we picked up Honey, Bear and Hopper and it’s clear that the experience has been very rewarding for both Dr. J and also the team who has worked with her. If anyone is interesting in participating in this extraordinary experience, leave a contact point in the guest book and someone will get back to you. A few words about our AT hike today. Gooch Gap was our starting point and we ended up at Neels Gap - a very, very long day. I think we overextended ourselves and violated our “take it easy in the beginning” guideline. We felt pretty good at the start and the temp was warmer than yesterday. Unfortunately, as the day progressed and we climbed higher, the clouds moved in and we went through periods of heavy mist and light rain. Blood Mountain is the highest point on the AT here in GA. Today there were no views and the trail was wet in many places, especially on the northern side of the mountain - which is also the rockiest. We made it without any slips, trips or falls. But our leg muscles are really hurting from the climbs. Tomorrow will be a shorter day. Neels Gap was a highlight of the day. The Baptist Churches in the area hosted Trail Magic for hikers under the boot tree in front of Mountain Crossings, the outfitter in the building at Neels Gap that was built by the CCC. Highlights: grilled hamburgers and great desserts, as well as other goodies.","Gooch Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557616,"Yesterday was not as damage-free as I thought. After sitting for a bit last night, I realized that I had a problem with my right hammy and my left quad. Neither seem to be severe, but I backed down on distance and pace today and we may do the same tomorrow. I suspect that yesterday I tried to come down the NoBo side of Blood Mtn. too fast and over extended my right leg. I still did some miles today, but much slower.The day got off to an interesting start. We took a one-lane gravel road across the Chattahoochee River as far as we could go towards the Big Stamp campground (the road continued, but was gated). Today was the first day of turkey hunting season in the area and we found a large group of hunters at the gate. One of them was just coming back to their camp with his trophy Tom and he was happy to pose with his prize. From that point, I followed the road beyond the gate on foot and then took an unmarked trail (using Guthook as a guide). The whole approach was perhaps 2 or more miles uphill from the gate. Finally the trail came out at a fire ring adjacent to the AT. GPS electronics is great!There was a large group of hikers at Hogpen Gap enjoying a trail magic setup. I didn’t spend much time there, but I did hear that the water source at this gap is contaminated and is roped off. Fortunately, we carry enough water in bladders to get us through a day’s hike. We do carry Sawyer mini-filters in case we run short, but the 0.1 micron size we use won’t filter out viruses.Both Princess and I saw a lot of hikers on the trail today. The skies were overcast in the morning, so it stayed cool. No rain on us today, but rain is forecast for tonight and the next 3 days. So hikers are preparing for a wet start to the week. We have been staying with Ranger and Gay in Blue Ridge most of the week. But our hiking sections are getting farther away and it's taking us a lot longer to drive to and from the trail. So we plan to move on to Hiawasse, GA tomorrow.","Neels Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557721,"Today the weather was less cooperative than previous days. Rain was in the forecast for last night, today and the next 2 days. And it showed up pretty much on schedule. Not continuous, drenching rain, but cloudy, misty, drippy conditions with occasional brief heavy showers. Incredibly, it didn’t seem to dampen hiker’s spirits. I did some SoBo miles today and virtually everyone I met was smiling and in a good mood. Granted, I didn’t meet that many folks when it was raining hard. Anyway, everybody seems to be coping with it for now. From my perspective, one of the real drawbacks of rainy weather is that we lose all of the long-range views. Winter or early spring hiking in Georgia on clear days provides some spectacular vistas from the mountain tops and ridges. Without leaves to block the view, we can get unfettered views that will diminish when the foliage arrives. But the clouds have been low for the last several days, hugging the mountain tops and obscuring the views. One hiker today commented that he was tired of walking in a fog. Maybe things will improve by Tuesday or Wednesday, but we’ll soon be out of trail in Georgia.As I noted yesterday, we packed up our gear and prepared to leave Ranger & Gay’s house and move on to a location closer to where we’re hiking. It’s hard to leave since they are such gracious and accommodating hosts, and there home is very comfortable. Plus they have 2 sweet rescue dogs, Tootsie and Sadie, that have developed a real bond with Princess. Nonetheless, it’s time to go, so we packed the car and made arrangements to stay in Hiawasse for a couple of days. One thing I haven’t mentioned is that we’re becoming a little more adventurous with regard to trail access roads. We’re supporting ourselves with our car and using “key swapping” to cover the distance. Late last year we decided to trade our Prius in on a new Toyota RAV4. We wanted something a little more substantial, more comfortable, and more suitable to support hiking. I’ll skip the comparisons, but the RAV4 is doing great. But today was a real test. We were able to navigate the RAV4 up Indian Grave Gap Rd. and then Tray Mountain Rd. over to Tray Gap. The route is mostly gravel, one-lane with turn-outs and not well maintained in some sections. The “S” gears behave like a standard transmission which is very helpful on these roads. And today, we had to “ford” a stream that was overflowing the road. It’s not recommended with the electrical hybrid system, but the water wasn’t high enough to cause a problem. The ability to use these gravel access roads opens a lot more opportunities for slack-packing sections.Sorry about rambling regarding vehicles, but trail access roads are an important consideration to slack-packers.","Poplar Stamp Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557866,"Hiawassee is an attractive town close to the sprawling shoreline of Lake Chatuge and not too far from the AT. We’ve been here a number of times, mostly while hiking. I always had the impression that it is somewhat larger than it is. But when looking for restaurants it’s pretty limited, with the exception of BBQ. However, there is good BBQ. We are weathering some wet weather here. We got drenched at the very end of the hike yesterday, and it rained intermittently overnight. Today started overcast and eventually improved to broken sunshine with only a few sprinkles along our part of the trail. But tonight several bands of thunderstorms are passing through and the trail will likely be wet in the morning. Plus more scattered rain is forecast tomorrow. Enough whining. Today’s section included Tray Mountain, Kelly’s Knob and Powell Mountain. Tray does not provide a panoramic view and there is very little room at the peak. Near the peak, the trail is narrow with bushes on either side. Further on down the trail there is a side trail near Powell Mountain that leads to a vista - but we generally don’t take blue blaze side trails. Given the overcast, the long-range views were not dramatic. So we don’t have many photos of today’s section. Princess was able to offer some suggestions to a hiker with blisters. Last night in the laundry room here at the motel, she talked with a lady who is having a terrible time with blisters. Her blisters are so bad that she planned to take a zero today to get medical attention. Princess has helped me overcome blister problems in past years and she offered the girl several strategies that might help. We've tried a lot of things like variations in socks, liners, toe guards, trimming shoes, panty hose, etc. She also passed along some supplies including: leukotape, alcohol swabs, and blister band-aids. It will be interesting to find out if she did see a doctor today and how she fares in the next few days. Blisters are a perennial trail problem, often ending thru-hiker hopes. And wet weather makes a bad situation worse, it’s hard to keep wounds clean on the trail.","Tray Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557987,"[FYI, there is now a direct link to my latest entry: www.trailjournals.com/Rocketman2017]We rose today in darkness and a quick look outside revealed lots of water puddles. The rain last night was accompanied by lightning and thunder. After a breakfast of French toast and a bagel & cream cheese, we set out. The sky was overcast and a cloud layer floated at the top of the highest mountains while the lower slopes were in the clear. Our target section today was Albert Mountain to Wayah Gap. We jumped ahead several sections since the Forest Service isn’t scheduled to open a mountain road that we need to use until April 1. And since the first is on Saturday, we don’t know if they’ll open it Friday - or more likely Monday. In fact, we’ve heard rumors that they opened it early because of the warm weather and we may check it out tomorrow. But if not, then we’ll just drive back to pick up these sections next week. An example of the added flex of slacking with your own car. So anyway, we drove up the long access road to Albert and parked about a quarter mile from the fire tower at the summit. I joined Princess in the climb up to the top for photos. The NoBo climb up Albert is steep and rocky at the end. The rocks were wet and somewhat slick, good practice for climbing. We took photos of each other, but the view from the top was straight into a cloud. Too bad, we’ve had some good long-range vistas here in the past.I've included 5 photos from today, including each of us on Albert and a dramatic shot showing a burned out section of the woods that we passed through. I'm sure we'll see more of this as we pass further into NC.I wonder if I’ll ever get used to driving these mountain access roads. Today some of the access roads were 10+ miles of narrow twisty-turny, one-lane gravel roads with steep drop offs. We don’t meet many cars and most of those are hunters, not hikers, so they’re familiar with the roads and accustomed to greenhorn drivers (I hope). I did have to drive across another river ford today — not fun, or recommended.The weather today improved steadily. By late morning the temp rose from low ‘50s to near 60 and burned off most of the low clouds. Later it peaked over 70 in the valleys and the breeze on the trail felt good. Mostly sunny with a few clouds, finally great views of the mountains.Since we’ve jumped ahead, we’re in a different set of fellow hikers and we’re also in North Carolina. But we’re not quite finished with Georgia and I’m not sure when we’ll hike through the last section there.","Albert Mountain

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558091,"First thing this morning (once we were on the road) was to check out the forest service road up to Deep Gap. We learned that it is in fact open even though the Forest Service recordings indicate that it won’t be open until April 1. And when we finally reached the end of the road at Deep Gap (about 6 miles of white knuckles) there were at least a half dozen vehicles already parked there. And it turns out that the gravel road is in pretty decent shape. So we revised our plans for the day and did a key swap between Deep Gap and Dick’s Creek. We met several other hikers along the way today. I’ve included photos of Stargazer and Chandler. I hiked with Chandler for a while and learned that he lived in Virginia Beach and also studied at George Mason (albeit several years after I attended there).I’ve included photos of Chandler, Princess and myself at the NC/GA state border marker on the trail, and a scenic photo showing what a nice day it turned out to be. It started out chilly, then later zoomed up into the mid-70’s. It was almost too hot for me, there was a lot of climbing today and I ran out of layers to shed.We checked out of the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee this morning and moved to the Nantahala Mountain Lodge run by Maggie and Wiggy. We didn’t know about this lodge until last year when Wiggy shuttled us and told us we should consider staying here if we came back. It is really attractive and set up especially for hikers. Wiggy did a thru-hike in 2010 and built in all of the features that he appreciated in the hostels he visited during his hike. We learned that he built the hostel himself. It’s very comfortable and we plan to stay here several days while we hike through the area.","Dick's Creek Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558178,"We learned yesterday that the Forest Service has opened the access road to Deep Gap. So yesterday we hiked the section just south of Deep Gap and today we hiked the section just north of Deep Gap, namely between Deep Gap and Albert Mountain.Good hiking conditions today, cool and dry, but miserable visibility. The cloud deck covered the top of most of the peaks and ridges along the trail. We couldn’t see any of the ridges in the distance and the fog condensed on the trees generating “tree rain” that constantly dripped on us. It was never wet enough to don our ponchos, but it was damp.Otherwise the hike was great. I did the NoBo version. I saw a few hikers, perhaps a dozen or so. However, most hikers are going NoBo, so I wouldn’t expect to see too many. Princess did the SoBo and said she saw a lot of hikers, maybe 50 or more. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the hike. A considerable portion of the hike was through areas where the forest was damaged by the forest fires last fall. It was ghostly in the fog and at times the fire odor was still in the air. I don’t know much about how forest fires propagate, some areas were heavily damaged while others showed only patchy charred areas. I've included several photos in the gallery including the pic featured on this page. There were long sections of burned-out rhododendron bushes. A year ago these sections were beautiful and we called them rhodo tunnels because the bushes were very old and had grown together overhead so it was like being in a long, green tunnel — hundreds of yards long at times. Now virtually all of the leaves are gone, with only charred branches left. Rhodos usually hang on to their leaves during the winter and provide a useful thermometer since their leaves curl up almost exactly at 32 deg F. So it was a stark landscape without leaves. In many places it seemed that the fires were concentrated around the base of clumps of rhodos, probably fueled by the dropped leaves. And as the leaves burned around the base, it seems that the fire destroyed the root system. There was a litter of unburned fallen leaves on top of the ashes that apparently weren’t touched by the fire, but fell afterward when the plant died. Another curious feature was a marked narrowing of the AT trail. It appeared that the soil has been eroded on each side of the path. I think the fire actually consumed the years of dead leaves that cover these areas, much like humus or mulch. In some areas it looked like 4 to 6 inches of cover had been eaten away on each side. Perhaps the AT path was so beaten down that it resisted the fire.","Deep Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558277,"We’re still at the Nantahala Mountain Lodge in Aquone, TN and it’s quite comfortable for us. It’s very clean and has all the features we like. Papa Smurf and Viet Nam Vet were here the last 2 nights and they checked out this morning to move on up the trail. We also talked with Maggie last night at dinner. She is participating in the Wounded Warrior Hike this year and also left this AM. She said her group is pushing on from NOC to Fontana and hopes to do it in one day. That’s a lot of miles.The 2 most memorable features today were the rainy weather and the fire devastation along sections of the trail. Briefly, the weather was heavy overcast (particularly at higher elevations) that started as a dense foggy mist and transitioned to rain. Then later the clouds lifted somewhat but the temp dropped and the winds increased. So the afternoon was chilly. But the weather didn’t seem to dampen anyone’s spirits and the hikers I met were making the best of it.The fire damage was more troubling. It’s not as if the whole trail has been affected, but long sections of the trail show some damage and there are pieces that appear to have been heavily damaged. The damage to the Wayah Bald Tower is dramatic. Beginning in the late 1800’s visitors began coming to the bald to camp and Sunday services were held here. The US Forest Service built the first wood fire lookout tower here in the 1920’s. In the 1930’s, the CCC improved the road to the bald and built a 3 story structure of quarry stone with a wooden roof. After a few years the structure began to have water problems and the FS took it out of service in 1945. The third floor was removed for safety and a concrete slab was poured so visitors could continue to use it. In 1983, the structure was repaired and a new wooden roof added for visitors. Unfortunately, only a fragment of one corner pillar of that roof remains.","Wayah Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558397,"We had a chilly start this AM, but the day cleaned up well and it was pleasant and sunny by afternoon. We followed Wiggy from here at the Nantahala Mountain Lodge to the NOC and then parked and left our car there (this would be our finishing point today). Then Wiggy drove the two of us to Stecoah Gap where we started our hike about 7:15 AM. We prefer to get an early start so that we can finish early and also avoid some of the afternoon heat.We started with a long climb up from Stecoah Gap. It was less that 1,000 ft, but it seemed steep and difficult to us. Certainly a good way to get warmed up. As we climbed we ran into the clouds and mist that were hanging near the top and the long-range visibility dropped dramatically. This has been the case for several days so it was nothing new. Near the top we met a couple that Princess has seen several times and took a photo of Shakin’ Annie and Deke. You can see the fog in the background of the photo. For the next several hours we had a lot of ups & downs until we finally started the ascent to Cheoah Bald. This bald is at 5062 ft, significantly above our starting point at 3,165 ft. The sun was trying to break through, but the mist still frustrated and long-range views. Several hikers had camped at or near the bald, but we moved on quickly and headed down from there. After Cheoah there was another shorter peak, Swim Bald at 4,710 ft, we didn’t pause there either. As we moved from one side of the ridge to the other, we passed from sunlight to mist. And the mist at higher elevations was producing heavy tree rain. After passing Swim Bald we had 6 miles or so of downhill, sometimes steep. I scored a first for the year on the way down: I slipped and fell as I was maneuvering across a field of rocks. I served as quite a diversion for a group of hikers who were drawing water from a stream 20 or 30 yards away. No damage other than my ego as far as I can tell. Last year I fell 3 times. After the hike, we had lunch at the Riverend Restaurant at the NOC. The NOC was hopping. People rafting, kayaking, fly fishing, and even hiking and other stuff. Lots of hikers in the restaurant. Both the AT and the Nantahala River run right through the NOC (at right angles to each other). Besides the restaurant, the NOC includes an outfitter, a hostel, cabins, and runs various river adventures. The restaurant has a fine selection of beers and I’ve been able to add to my Untappd library. Today I had a GreyBeard IPA and a Rebel Juiced IPA. Not too shabby. Tomorrow our plan is similar to today, except that we’ll hike the section just south of the NOC. And we’ll hike NoBo so that we finish at the NOC again and just about time for lunch.","Stecoah Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558474,"Today was the beautiful day that we’ve been promised. We were up early, dropped our car at NOC and Wiggy delivered us to Tellico Gap in time to see the start of a great sunrise. The long climb to the bald chased away the morning chills and I finally got a look at the observation tower. Too bad I was a little too pooped to climb to the top. You can tell from the photo that there are a lot of steps.The section of the AT that we hiked today had a lot of fire damage (similar to others we’re hiked recently). We could see it on the first climb and much of the first half of the hike. In some areas the fire had eroded the trail to the point where it was difficult to get through. It looks like the trail maintenance volunteers will have their work cut out for them.The Jumpoff was really dramatic on a day like today. It’s quiet and beautiful and peaceful and dramatic all at once. The green contours on the mountainsides are incredible. It is amazing. Maneuvering around the jump off is a little spooky for me because of the height which is really difficult to capture in a photo.After the Jumpoff, there is a long downhill into NOC interrupted by a few bumps. We passed a few hikers along the way: Pack, we met several days ago; Cash Back; and Wolverine, Princess met him - not sure if I have. Also near the end of our hike we saw two groups of hikers coming up from NOC for a day hike.We have one more night at Nantahala Mountain Lodge and we check out tomorrow AM. After our hike tomorrow, we’ll set up shop in Hot Springs, NC. We’ve been there before and really like it. We expect to be there several days while we hike the sections around there. And we're hoping that Ranger and his wife Gay will be able to meet us there.","Tellico Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558675,"Today has been tagged as a rain day for some time and it lived up to it’s billing. Rain was forecast to begin around 9 or 10 in the morning and continue for most of the day. And it was advertised to include thunderstorms. The rains moved in on schedule and continued most of the day — heavy at times. The good news is that the thunderstorms weren’t as consistent as expected. And the area certainly needs the rain.The feature of the day was Jacob’s Ladder, a very steep hill about a mile or so north of our starting point, Stecoah Gap. It really lives up to it’s tough reputation. Fortunately it was still dry for me. I’ve tried it both NoBo and SoBo and my preference is definitely to climb rather than descend the ladder. The lower part of the climb is pretty much straight up. The upper part has switchbacks, but they still seem steep. And once you get over the top, the backside is not that easy to descend. Again, good thing that it was dry when I went through.Once the rains started and the trail got wet, hiking was less pleasant. The end of the section was a long descent into the Fontana Lake/Dam area. When the downhill is wet, I have to go a lot slower. Roots and rocks conspire against me. I remember from past years that during the downhill, the views of the lake are impressive. Today the lake was visible, but indistinct. A good thing since I had to concentrate on the footing.After the hike, we headed for Hot Springs, NC, our next base of operations. We hiked the Smokies in November so now we’ll move to the north end of GSMNP and commute from Hot Springs for 4 or 5 days. Hot Springs is a favorite for us, there is a good outfitter (Bluff Mountain), we are familiar with a downtown motel (Creekside), there is a laundry close by, and we like the Creekside Tavern. After drying out and cleaning up, we stopped by the tavern to relax and said hello to the owners, Amanda and Tim. We’re looking forward to the rest of the week.","Stecoah Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558803,"Granted, we’ve been doing a jigsaw puzzle of trail sections in the last week or so. Basically we started at Springer and hiked NoBo to Fontana Dam, the southern end of the AT through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Now we’re going to take advantage of hiking through GSMNP last October and jump to the north end of GSMNP and continue from there. As I described in the “About” section of this Journal, we’re doing a thru-hike that started on October 16, 2016, and our plan is to finish the hike within a year, by October 15, 2017.So, after yesterday’s wet hike, we drove north to Hot Springs, NC and set up in the Creekside Court. Today we got up really early and headed south to Standing Bear Hostel. We had arranged for KOG at Standing Bear to shuttle us up to Brown Gap. The fastest route to Standing Bear took us through Newport and an hour later we parked at the hostel. Maria is continuing to improve the facility, the stone patio is finished and we noticed some other changes from last year. All went well, we hopped in KOG’s rented Impala and 20 minutes later we were up at Brown Gap. We took a photo of Princess and KOG and started our SoBo hike back to our car that we left at Standing Bear. After the rainstorms yesterday, today’s weather was blissful. Everyone we met on the trail was in a fantastic mood. There were a few white clouds in an otherwise perfectly clear day. The temp was cool, just right for hiking and after an hour of climbing we were sweating. The highlight of the hike was Snowbird Mountain with absolutely incredible views. It seemed to take forever to get to the grassy bald at the top. The breeze was chilly on the bald, but not too cold to take photos. The FAA installation on the side of the bald looks like a UFO. As we started the descent from Snowbird, we were reminded of an incident 3 years ago during our first AT hike. We were backpacking NoBo up Snowbird from Standing Bear and walked right past a right turn on the AT. We were on an old forest service road and the snow had piled up the previous night. We were the first ones up that morning and there were no tracks in the snow. We rationalized that the reason we missed the turn in the trail was that Rambles (another hiker we met that year) had hung his hammock across the trail RIGHT AT THE TURN - literally from one side of the trail to the other - completely blocking the path. We saw his hammock, didn’t see the blazes beyond it and just continued straight on the FS road. Luckily we came out just below the FAA tower, saw the tower and headed toward it and eventually got back on the trail at the bald. Ranger was hiking with us then and periodically we have another laugh about Rambles hammock blocking the trail. Rambles defense was that he hiked up the previous night in the snowstorm, ran out of gas and had no idea where he was hanging his hammock.Enough nostalgia. After Snowbird, it was mostly downhill. The real fun part was meeting all the NoBo hikers heading uphill towards Snowbird. I’m guessing 50 of them. I took a photo of 2 fellows relaxing on a log. All-in-all a lot of fun people intent on reaching Maine.After we finished we headed back to Hot Springs and had enough time left in the afternoon to partake in the hot tubs at the Hot Springs Spa. A terrific way to finish the day. PS: I was able to find tubular webbing at the Bluff Mountain Outfitters here in Hot Springs. Last year, One More (one of our hiking partners) suggested that tubular webbing is a great way to extend the life on your gaitors. Typically the plastic strap that goes under each foot eventually breaks from the wear and tear on the rocks. But One More helped me slip a piece of tubular webbing over the plastic strap to protect it. Eventually the gaitors wore out before the webbing/strap did. In a pinch, a short piece of Tygon tubing will serve the same purpose, but the tubing can be a little more slippery than the webbing.","Brown Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558884,"We’re shuffling some sections to try and catch good weather on top of Max Patch and on Firescald. So today we skipped ahead and hiked from Lemon Gap into Hot Springs. Princess set up a shuttle with Dan from Bluff Mountain Outfitters and he drove us up to our starting point at Lemon Gap. Then we were able to hike together the 14.5 miles into Hot Springs. The weather looks chancy for the next two days, so we may take a rest here in town and hike Max Patch and Firescald on Saturday and Sunday when the weather is expected to be warmer, clearer and dry. We’ll play it by ear.We got up early, met Dan at 6:00 and took off from Lemon Gap around 7:00. We had 2 significant mountains in the section: Walnut and Bluff. Walnut (4245 ft.) was first and was a good warmup, I was sweating by the time I reached the top. There was a small grassy area at the top and the Walnut Mountain Shelter just a little further on. We talked briefly with 3 hikers who were packing up at the shelter (Chopsticks, Pole Runner & Dancing’ Dan) and learned that they were also headed into Hot Springs. We told them we would buy them a beer at the tavern. Must have been a great incentive - later they ran past us on the final descent into Hot Springs. The climb up Bluff Mountain (4686 ft) seemed much longer and followed by a very long descent to Garenflo Gap. During the climb and descent we hiked for a time with another hiker from New Hampshire. He’s been hiking the White Mountains all his life and lives very close to the southern end of the Whites. Eventually we learned that he and his significant other were part of the rescue team that helped us get off Mt. Lafayette last summer. What an incredible coincidence. We had a great hiking conversation. When we asked why he is doing the AT, he said his father has always wanted to hike the AT, but now that he’s retired he can’t do it any longer. So now he’s 40, he’s always wanted to do the AT and he doesn’t want to get caught in the trap his father did. He said he’ll make it to Katahdin if he has to do it in a wheel chair.As we hiked the last mile or two into town, the clouds gathered above and we were treated to several rounds of overhead thunder. No lightning, but the thunder sounded close. And rain started just as we arrived at the motel. We were pretty lucky, hope our luck with the weather continues.","Lemon Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559338,"Hello again. Princess and I just got off the phone talking to Spartacus and his wife Janelle. Spartacus was our hiking partner in 2015 and it was really great to touch base with them. We shared some terrific times with them and we’re looking forward to getting together when we get back to New England later this summer. Love you guys.We dropped off the grid for the last 2 days and spent them here in Hot Springs, NC. Two reasons: first, Ranger (Princess’ bro and our hiking partner in 2014 and 2015) came to visit us here in NC with his wife Gay and their 2 dogs, Tootsie and Sadie. We had a wonderful time. We went back to a fav haunt, Spring Creek Tavern and I sampled as many of their craft beers as I could, we visited the “Artisan” each day for coffee, ice cream, etc., we supported the Bluff Mountain Outfitters (a terrific place for hikers), we went back to the Smoky Mountain Diner for breakfast each day (an all time favorite of ours), we sampled the “hot baths” at the Hot Springs Spa three times, we toasted the weekend at the Iron Horse Station and we found a great place for a fabulous dinner (Mountain Magnolia Inn) that was new to us and we will definitely stay there next year. The Magnolia has a great menu and Sarah, Selena and Zeb (the chef) treated us very, very well. Oh yes, and the second reason was that the weather on Thursday and Friday was not terribly conducive to hiking. Thursday was wet and windy and Friday was chilly and windy. Such is the life of slack packers.FYI, for those of you who might be interested in more info on slack packing, do an Amazon book search on “Vann, slack”.Today, our hiking adventure started early with an early (6:30) breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner, saying adios to Ranger & Gay, then hiking the section between Hot Springs and Allen Gap. I remembered plenty of spots along this section from previous years. Last year, Grasshopper joined us on this section and we took a photo sitting on the bench by a pond. The first part of the section has some great views of the French Broad River from Lover’s Leap. The second part is more of a wood’s hike, not too many views - mostly ups and downs. The day started off colder than we’ve experienced so far, but there was virtually no wind so it was manageable. I did start with a toboggan, wool mittens, a buff and my Thermoball jacket - I shed the jacket after the first serious climb. Just traces of ice at the start, no snow, and then it warmed up with the midday sun.So we had 2 great days of R&R, then a good hike today. The weather tomorrow is expected to be even better with clear skies and we’ve been angling to do Max Patch on a good day. So we plan to hike from Brown Gap to Lemon Gap, with some shuttling help from Dan at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. We stopped by Bluff Mountain this afternoon and talked with Dan a bit and met his wife. He reminisced a little about some of his long-time friends who passed over the last year, some of the AT legends (Baltimore Jack for example). We really appreciate the fact that there are so many folks in the AT support community along the trail who help make it such a great experience. And we didn’t realize how many people it takes to keep it going until after we came back the second year to slack the trail.","Hot Springs, NC

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559461,"Yesterday was a really nice hiking day, but today was superb. Clear skies from the outset, just a bit chilly initially until halfway through the first uphill, and we could see for miles and miles from the mountaintops. Everyday can’t possibly be like today, although we’ll savor these opportunities when they come. Today we filled in a gap that we left between Brown Gap and Lemon Gap. Slack packing gives us the luxury of picking and choosing when we want to hike a particular section of trail. However, the decision on when to do today’s section was mostly weather-related. For 3 years, we’ve missed the opportunity to really see the view from the top of Max Patch, (bitter freezing cold, wind and snow the first year, dense fog the second year and blowing cold rain the third). So this year we held off until the weather gods looked favorably on us. Dan from Bluff Mountain got up a half-hour early to shuttle us to Brown Gap (after leaving our car at Lemon Gap) and we crossed up and over Max Patch under the best conditions that we could imagine. We actually passed by the Max Patch parking lot on the shuttle to Lemon Gap and it was overflowing with visitors who came to watch the sunrise (and possibly the moon as well). The sunrise was long gone before we hiked back to the Patch, but we did see it earlier from some bends in the mountain roads and it was spectacular - the most intense blood red layer on the horizon that I’ve ever seen. Once Dan deposited us at Brown’s Gap, we had a long climb up successive shoulders on the ridge until we finally reached Max Patch. The final climb to the top was up a series of log steps flanked by the remnants of snow banks, and then across the grassy patch. There was residual snow on the upper slopes, but the sun was bright and the temp was ranging up through the 40’s. We saw lots of hikers & visitors on the Patch and quite a few tents right at the summit. The long-range view was as good as I’ve ever seen. It almost looked like a painting, successive layers of different shades of blue ranging as far as I could see to the horizon. I only wish I could capture them in a photo well enough to re-create the moment. Afterwards, the rest was mostly downhill. But a long gradual downhill through lots of rhododendrons and along noisy cascading creeks. A really delightful hike that we both thoroughly enjoyed. With the exception of the Patch itself, we passed only one hiker along the whole route. Although there were a number of hikers in campsites and shelters along the way.Afterwards, we headed back to Hot Springs to shower, do the laundry, pack the car and move on to our next base at Catarroso Farm in Erwin, TN. The drive to Erwin was along a 2-lane road with a thousand curves. Cantarosso is as just as pleasant as we remember from the past. The property is in a delightful setting on the banks of the Nolichucky River. Peggy helped us get settled (Mike is finishing a river trip in Virginia). After we unloaded, Peggy suggested that we drive up to Johnson City for dinner - a great idea since we’ve never visited there. She offered to be the designated driver, what a generous offer. We had dinner at Southern Craft BBQ and it was great. I had smoked brisket, fried okra and veggies, plus the opportunity to sample Princess’ burnt ends BBQ. Washed down with Tree Streets Pale Ale and Red Jam American Amber. And we wrapped up the visit with a sample of 3 beers at Yee Haw Brewing Company just down the street ( Beast of Burden (red IPA), Dunkel (Munich lager) and Big Hoppa (Double IPA). And it included a great visit with Peggy. So it was a great day from all perspectives and tomorrow promises to be every bit as good.","Brown Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559632,"Another good weather day. Anticipating a good day we opted to key swap the section that includes Big Bald, Big Stamp and High Rock. And the weather cooperated. Also, the forecast didn’t include rain, so we slept in an hour. I took the NoBo version of today’s hike and my starting elevation was about 500 ft above Princess’ start. Plus her climb to Big Bald, the high point of the day (5,516 ft.) was shorter. So her climb was steeper than mine. But she’s a better climber than I am. I met her near Big Stamp after she parked the car at Spivey Gap and hiked SoBo from there.I started with a climb to a meadow that is a favorite spot for me. At the top of the meadow, the trail curves down a slope and then up another hill before it disappears into a woods. For the first time today, I spotted Big Bald on the distant horizon. The top is very distinctive. Perhaps the visibility may not have been as good in the past. And I was able to see the bald from several other points along the trail as I approached it. Big Bald itself provides a great view in all directions. There is a ski complex on an adjacent mountain that is very prominent as you approach the summit (NoBo). I took some photos at the top and I had the summit to myself. From the Big Bald summit, there is also a great view of Big Stamp. As you descend from Big Bald, there is a saddle and then the trail rises up to Big Stamp which is only several hundred feet lower than Big Bald. Beyond that point, the trail passes into woods and the views are limited for the rest of the way.Big Bald was the most prominent feature on today’s hike. There is a Little Bald several miles farther NoBo, but it’s tree covered. The other remarkable point was High Rocks. After a sharp descent from Little Bald, the trail starts uphill again and becomes quite rocky. The rocks are quite impressive at the top as the AT winds around them. There is a short trail to the top, but I confess that I’ve never taken it (I’m too pooped from the climb to that point). The trail designers and maintainers have done some impressive stonework around the top of High Rocks, especially on the NoBo descent. It’s hard to imagine what the trail would be like without the stone steps and features that they’ve provided.We’re staying another couple of nights at Cantarroso Farm. The private room they provide in their house is very comfortable and has everything that we need. Fred: I tried to respond to your question in the Guest Book, but it says that the email address you gave was not valid. You have a good question. Shuttle times (or our driving times) can vary widely. Sometimes the only access routes are windy, steep, narrow gravel mountain roads (slow). Other times they're on primary highways with large parking lots. We typically try to pick lodging locations that minimize the shuttle drive times. Another factor we also try to take into consideration is how far a shuttle driver has to travel to pick us up. The first year we tried to slack a full thru-hike, we didn't take our car along. Now we do and it gives us more flexibility. Sometimes we support ourselves with key-swaps, other times we rely on shuttle drivers. And sometimes we follow the shuttle driver to one end point and leave the car there, then ride with the shuttle driver to the other end point and we both start hiking from there back to our car so that we can hike together and we don't have to worry about a rendezvous with the shuttler at the end of our hike.","Sam's Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559739,"What a treat — another great day, lots of sun, almost 80 deg and no rain. Today we did a key swap with an early start and were finished around noon. I did the NoBo direction again and it was a little chilly when Princess dropped me off at the US 19W trailhead. But as usual there was a climb up and out of the gap that warmed me up quickly. And coming out of the shadow and into the sunlight at the top of the hill is always special. After the initial climb, most of my hike was level or downhill. Besides meeting Princess along the way, I saw only 2 other hikers that passed me moving very quickly, then I passed them taking a break at the shelter and I never saw them again. The trail is in great shape with several good water sources that were flowing nicely. The most notable features today were the views from the overlooks on the long downhill into Erwin. The Nolichucky is a big river that’s easy to spot and a railroad runs along the river and crosses it on a long bridge. The town is spread out, but quite visible from a long distance. There are at least 4 good spots along the descent that present great views of the valley. This evening is our last night here at Cantarroso Farm in Ervin. Uncle Johnny’s is the most notorious lodging here in Erwin, but after staying there the first year, we looked for something different. Cantarroso is much more our style. A beautiful secluded spot right on the banks of the river. Peggy and Mike are great hosts. We stay in the room in their house, but they also have 2 separate cabins. They both love to canoe, but they also hike and help maintain the trail. Mike is a beekeeper. Peggy is more into hiking and has done a lot of the trails in the area.

Once again, we’ve really enjoyed our stay here and it’s hard to leave when you’re comfortable with a place. Mike and Peggy advertise personalized service in a quiet, clean environment and we can vouch for that. It’s always a pleasure to stay here and we look forward to hiking this section of the trail. Also, this year Peggy introduced us to Johnson City and we found a couple of great spots there.There was evidence of some overnight rain, some puddles and damp spots on the drive out to the trail. We followed Mike (from Cantarosso) to the Sam’s Gap parking area and left our car there. Then Mike drove us to our starting point at Devil Fork Gap. So we were able to hike SoBo together back to our car at Sam’s Gap. The temperature was quite mild, but the sky was overcast and fog and mist was clinging to the top and sides of the mountains. One of my photos shows a view from a mountainside of fog lying in the valley—it looked almost like a lake. For the most part the trail was damp, but not muddy and we had decent traction on even the steepest parts of the trail. Later in the hike, the clouds thinned and the sun began to poke through. Fortunately, it didn’t get too hot.I found several interesting features along the trail today and captured some of them in photos. These included seeing my first red-spotted newt this year, seeing my first trout lily bloom, seeing a couple of snails nudging each other on a log, and passing an old gravesite along the AT that I hadn't noticed before. We rock-hopped across a stream and then later downhill crossed back over the same stream. The second time we were treated to a pretty waterfall of perhaps 10 feet splashing down over a rock face. Overall it was a fine day.We took off directly from our finishing point and drove north to Damascus. Last fall, we hiked the AT from Erwin, TN almost to Atkins, VA. So we plan to pick up where we left off and continue north from there. Damascus is still south of Atkins, but we want to stop by and see Miss Ginny at The Lazy Fox in Damascus. So we’ll spend a night here in Damascus. We’re still rearranging our hiking schedule and sequence, so we’re not quite sure what we’ll do next.Damascus appears to be more active than when we were here last October, but looks can be deceiving. When we finally headed out to get something to eat, most of the places we wanted to go were closed. Some are only open on weekends and others don’t plan to open for the summer season for a couple more weeks. So we ended up driving about 20 min to Abingdon and eating at the Rain Restaurant. It worked out well for us, we both had great meals. We did have a chance to visit Mt. Rogers Outfitters and catch up on trail news with Jeff and Lumpy. And we also found the brick that we sponsored on the Damascus sidewalk. We dedicated it to Adam DeWolf for saving us on Mt. Lafayette last June. It’s near the east end of the inscribed bricks on Laurel Ave.","Devil Fork Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559991,"We decided to spend a second night at Miss Ginny’s Lazy Fox in Damascus. This gave us a longer drive to the trail today, but we like Damascus and we didn’t get a chance to visit some of our favorite stops. For example, BoBo’s was closed yesterday and the Damascus Brewery only opens Thurs thru Sat. So we’ll have a second chance this evening.The weatherman smiled on us yet again today. It was a cool start that made for very comfortable hiking. And the breeze on the ridges helped cool us off after climbing up. The skies were mostly clear and blue. Today we picked up where we stopped hiking last November, at VA 670, the South Fork of the Holston River and going from there to the Lindamood School where parking is available. We would have preferred to end at Glade Mountain Road, but the AT Guide says that road is private and permission is required. Plus it advises that the road may not be suitable for passenger vehicles. So we extended the section to VA 615 with a key swap. When I hiked across Glade Mountain Road on the AT, it had fresh gravel and looked well graded with a couple of parking spots at the trailhead, but it may have been must worse further down.The first portion from the river to Partnership Shelter was relatively benign, mostly flat through open woods. Not too many features worth noting. Partnership Shelter was about 8 miles into the hike. Princess for the first time noticed the lake that is just down from this shelter. This is a very nice shelter with some amenities that is adjacent to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center. Hikers can call from the Visitor Center to have pizzas delivered to the shelter. Going north from Partnership, the trail starts a climb that leads up Glade Mountain, eventually to what appears to be the summit at 4,113. The summit is wooded, but there is a view just a little further down. The descent north from the top is a little over 3 miles. Some of the upper parts are a bit steep, eventually less so and there is a long hike through rhododendron groves that track along a stream. I didn’t count the number of rock-hops across the stream but it had to be at least six. The thing I remember most about Glade Mountain are the rocks—plenty of them. Not big ones to climb over, but smaller pointy nuisance rocks, like PA. Chatfield Shelter was about halfway down.Lindamood School is memorable. It’s open and today there was plenty of trail magic inside. Princess was waiting on me there as well as 2 others: Beaker and First Sarge. Apparently Beaker recognized Princess from TrailJournals and struck up a conversation before I arrived. We had a good chat and I hope to see them again, although Beaker is taking several weeks off to help his wife relocate to a different house. When we hiked the AT in 2014, I wrote about the Lindamood School in TrailJournals and Carol Lindamood wrote a very nice note in the guest book in response. She appreciated the thanks for the trail magic and the recognition for the school. When you pass the school, I suggest that you step inside and get a sense of our past. There are some really interesting charts on the wall. Thank you again Carol for the gracious trail magic.","South Fork Holston River

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560246,"Instead of the usual trail photo, I decided to post a shot I took a couple of days ago in Damascus. Some of you may be familiar with our experience last year in the White Mountains. The essence of the story is that we got in big trouble when we were crossing Franconia Ridge in New Hampshire. We had been above treelike for some time and had covered several miles of the trail on the ridge. We had anticipated rain, but as we moved across the ridge it began to sleet and the winds increased to 50 to 60 mph with gusts up to 80 mph. Rime ice was starting to form on the rocks and on our glasses to the point where we couldn’t see the trail (we really need our glasses). We got slower and slower and eventually we weren’t sure which way the trail went. We tried to get our maps, etc. out, but the wind made it impossible. We finally hunkered down behind a rock, we were stuck and getting very cold. Realizing that we were in a very dangerous predicament we set off our emergency beacon to call for a rescue. With incredible good fortune a thru-hiker named Adam DeWolfe came across us and offered to help. He was confident of where the trail went and got us down to a rock outcropping that provided some cover. Then he managed to get his (single-person) tent set up over us and kept us from freezing until help arrived. It took the rescue team 4 to 5 hours to get to us. Once they got us warmed up, they were able to get us down below treelike (only a quarter mile away, but none of us could see it), and eventually we were able to walk down a side trail under our own power. We are indebted to everyone in the rescue team who came up to help us, but without Wolfman I doubt that I would be writing this story. What about the photo?? Damascus, VA prides itself as an AT Trail Town and has a donation program that includes adding inscribed bricks in the sidewalk of it’s main street. In honor of Wolfman we sponsored the brick shown in the photo. For any of you who may visit Damascus during Trail Days in May, this brick is a block or so east of Mt. Rogers Outfitters. Another great weather day. I guess we’ll have to pay back next week, it may be much wetter. We had a long day today. One drawback to slack packing in this area is that the access roads are about as challenging as the AT. Especially around the Burke’s Garden area. The last two years we’ve used shuttles and we thought we’d try to do it ourselves this time. I’ve found that driving up these mountain roads is a lot more stressful than having someone else do the driving. In past years we used Bubba (from Bland, VA) in this area and he is good. Although Princess seems to enjoy driving on these winding roads.The section of the trail around Atkins is really interesting. It tracks though a lot of variations in terrain. Often, much of the hike is up and down through open woods, or through rhodo tunnels. I enjoy that, but today it was mixed in with meadows, farms, a boardwalk over a marshy area, some scrub tree stands, forsythia, a grove of a really fragrant bush that I couldn’t place, etc. So it was a nice change of pace for me.Previously we’ve stayed in or near Atkins. The Relax Inn the first year was miserable and we quickly relocated to the Comfort Inn just down the road. Next year we went back to the Comfort Inn, so we thought we’d try something different this time. The car gives us more opportunities, so we headed up the interstate to Wytheville. Princess found us new digs in the Bolling-Wilson Hotel downtown in Wytheville. Edith Billing was Woodrow Wilson’s wife (and a descendant of Pocahontas), and many of the furnishings and art pieces here center around her interests: canaries, orchids, and bourbon. I don’t have a lot of info on the history here, but I think the hotel is a relatively new tenant in an older structure. Everything in the hotel appears to be new and first rate. The price is a real bargain, probably to begin to grow their clientele. Ultra-clean, very responsive staff, a real gem. We had dinner in the restaurant and our meals were terrific, and there is a rooftop lounge. Perhaps too many superlatives, but we’re really impressed. We’re trying to figure out how to stay here a little longer.","Lindamood School

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560241,"This section is one of the most difficult to access for slack packing. The trail here follows the east ridge around Burke’s Garden. Burke’s Garden (aka God’s Thumbprint) is an interesting feature that I’ve talked about in previous years. And Wallace gave a very exact description of it in our guest book (check it out: April 14, 2015). In addition to the very interesting and unusual geologic characteristics, it’s also very beautiful. And today we were treated to some great views.The section involves a really long, seemingly endless 2,000 ft climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter from the gravel access road. Fortunately after an initial couple of miles of steep climb the grade comes down to a more manageable moderate climb. The last couple of miles are through an extended grassy meadow with some great views to the southeast. Ultimately the reward is Chestnut Knob Shelter. It’s an old fire warden’s cabin and the base of the tower is visible just a few feet away from the cabin. The inside of the rock shelter is nice with bunk platforms for hikers. It’s in the middle of a grassy field that has a magnificent view of Burke’s Garden.North from the shelter is a pretty steep descent to a gap and then a moderate climb and ridge walk along the east ridge of Burke’s Garden. The trees are still bare enough to offer some partial views, but the ups and downs along the rocky ridge become monotonous. The end of today’s hike was VA 623. But that will be the starting point tomorrow and the ridge walk will continue.This evening we hosted “One More”, a fellow hiker from last year who drove up from Asheville, NC to visit (a 3 hour drive). We had a great dinner here at the hotel reminiscing and catching up on news. One More was in our group when we got caught on Mt. Lafayette last year. He was ahead of us and eventually managed to get to the hut. Later I hiked with him down Mt. Madison and also several sections in Maine. He’s my age and still an active hiker. He’s heading for some hiking in the Pearisburg area later this year with a friend and plans to do Camino in Spain next year. We really appreciate that he took the time to drive up and visit. He brought his award-winning (really) dog Jazz along with him. We first met One More and Jazz in Connecticut in 2015. Jazz is the most amazing dog I’ve ever encountered and he got treated to our prime rib leftovers for enduring the drive up from NC. Thanks and best wishes to One More and Jazz.","VA 625

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560401,"Happy Easter to everyone. We hope your day was as pleasant as ours. A slight threat of rain never materialized and we had broken clouds most of the day with mild temps. Again it was another key swap for us. I’ll give you my NoBo version. Starting at VA 623, the trail finishes the rocky ridge around Burke’s Garden and then drops down to Jenkins Shelter. After climbing up from the shelter the trail levels at about 3,000 ft for a couple of miles and then drops again to Laurel Creek. There is a sturdy bridge across creek and a campsite with a picnic table in a rhododendron grove just to the north across the gravel road. Above the creek there is a moderate climb with lots of switchbacks back up to 3K elevation, followed by several miles of hillside trail on the west side of the ridge. The valley below the ridge was visible through the trees, but I only found one vantage point with a more-or-less unbroken view. The trail weaves around the contours of the ridge until it finally pops out on a gravel road. I had a little trouble finding the next blaze, but Guthook helped and eventually I remembered that the trail follows the gravel road around the bend and down the hill (don’t follow the gravel path that heads down under the power lines). At the end of the gravel road there is a trail store with a sign that says something like “coming soon"", but I doubt it. Again I had a little trouble remembering how to navigate to the other side of I-77. I was tempted to climb the path left of the road, but I think the AT actually follows the road (US 52) down the hill to a sharp bend. At that point, the trail turns right (off of US 52) onto VA 612. And VA 612 goes down again and around a bend to the left and over I-77 — which was our end point for the day. I hope today was my last trip up (or down) VA 623. This is probably the twistiest, nastiest gravel mountain road that I use on the AT. I took a pic of my GPS in the car as I was near the top today. The photo shows the hairpin switchbacks near the top of the climb. Someone has put a mailbox high up on a tree at the last hairpin before the road crests the ridge. I’ve included a photo of it—and last year our shuttle driver dubbed it “airmail”. And overnight a tree fell across the road near the top, fortunately there was just enough room between the tree and the edge of the drop-off, I held my breath. There were a couple of vehicles at the trailhead at the top, but we never met any other cars either going up or drown the narrow road.","VA 623

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560471,"We raced to beat the rain and almost won. Initially the rain was forecast for the afternoon. The morning forecast indicated that it would start around 11. We could have beaten the original schedule, but we got dripped on a little. We’re prepared for rain, but who wants to get wet and messy if you can avoid it. Another key swap, but I’ll describe it as NoBo. From the I-77 overpass (VA 612) the trail goes down the road and around to a small parking lot next to Kimberling Creek. The AT Guide suggests that drinking is discouraged here, perhaps it’s from the multitude of cattle farms in the area? From the creek and a small campsite, the trail climbs sharply to the ridgeline and not long after that a side trail leads to Halves Mill Shelter. For the next 7 or 8 miles, the trail meanders over the ridgeline with some modest ups and downs. Initially the sun was out, but the cloud bank crept in from the west and eventually obscured the sun. There was a moderate climb over Brushy Mountain, past Jenny Knob Shelter and then a longer downhill to Lickskillet Hollow. The last climb was about 600 ft over about a mile and a half. Then a long descent down to a notable suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. I guess this is the same creek that we crossed initially, but it’s considerably larger at this point. Once again, the AT Guide suggests that drinking is discouraged here. Just beyond the bridge, the trail crosses VA 606 and Trents Grocery is only about 0.5 miles down the road. This is a favorite stop for AT hikers, good burgers, ice cream, etc. And we’ve stayed there twice in the past in a room just behind the grocery. But since we have our car, we’re staying one more night in Wytheville, not too far away. Tomorrow our plan is to move on to Woods Hole Hostel.","I-77

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560989,"Today we had the luxury of hiking together. We checked out of the Bolling-Wilson Hotel in Wytheville before dawn and headed north to the Woods Hole Hostel. The hostel is located partway up a mountainside near Pearisburg, VA. Neville and Michael run the hostel and their associated farm in a very eco-friendly way. We’ve been coming here since our first visit in 2014 and we’ve seen dramatic improvements and additions to the property since then. The hostel has a great reputation and is very popular with hikers. Their bunkhouse accommodates a number of hikers, and they also have private and semi-private rooms in the house. The hostel is about a half-mile from the AT, so we drove directly to the hostel, parked the car and started our hike from there. There were a few sprinkles on the windshield during our drive, but we never saw any more rain (nor sun for that matter). We headed SoBo today planning to finish at VA 606. One feature that I remember about the area around Woods Hole is the large number of rocks, both on and off the trail. Almost immediately we started climbing to a ridge and walked along the ridge or just to the western side of it. As we approached the end of the ridge we were treated to a terrific view of the valley from a rock outcropping just a few feet off the trail. While there, we met Friendly Ghost and Beetle who were also looking for overlooks and they may also be staying at Woods Hole this evening.Beyond the ridgeline we began to descend, rather steeply at times. We were glad we weren’t going NoBo because it would have been steep at times. As the trail began to level out, we passed by Wapiti Shelter and I felt compelled to make a quick stop for a photo. The shelter is infamous for the murder of two young women hikers many years ago. I stopped there once before and I’ve never seen anyone at the shelter which makes it a little eerie.After passing the shelter, the trail was generally level for a number of miles. Much of it was through rhododendron groves along a stream and over the stream a number of times. It was really a very attractive section. Closer to the end of the hike, the trail paralleled a much larger stream, then split off. Later we saw a side trail to Dismal Falls which I suspect was on the same stream. The final climb took us up along the side of a ridge before dropping down to the gap where we finished yesterday. When we popped out onto VA 606, we headed west for about a half-mile to Trent’s Grocery. My reward for today’s efforts was a BLT and a pint of butter pecan ice cream. By the time I finished the ice cream, Bubba had arrived to shuttle us back to Woods Hole. We joined Matador and North Star in the van who were also headed back to Woods Hole. Matador plans to take a day or two off to rest an ankle that he twisted badly on the trail. The only issue I have with Woods Hole is that they don’t have WiFi, so I won’t be able to post this until I can reach a signal.","VA 606

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560991,"This is a little unconventional. I’m sitting in our car looking out across a small brook and a gravel lane at the side of a hill that we climbed this morning. The sun is trying desperately to break through the fog that seems to be hanging over the hostel. I have our hiking shoes sitting above me on the roof of our car hoping that they’ll get enough sun to dry out, but it’s going to be close. I tried several times to get this journal entry started. But our “room” here at the hostel is upstairs above the common area and after an hour or more of essentially “eavesdropping” on the conversations between hikers just below me, I realized that I would never be able to focus—and thus retreated to the car. It’s not that the discussion isn’t interesting. The various hikers have incredibly diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences. That’s actually the problem, it’s too interesting. But I also got caught up in the structure of the exchanges, basically each hiker trying to segue smoothly and then top the previous hiker’s story. All within the context of hiker etiquette and correctness.Besides Neville and Michael, we found a special treat at Woods Hole. Tree Ninja, a hiker we first met in 2015 is helping them with the hostel duties. We encountered him a number of times on the trail, most often when we were hiking SoBo and he was headed NoBo. We always saw him early in the AM and he moved quickly. After a few days he was well beyond us. It is always a treat to meet a hiker that you know from past years.Today’s trail experience: We decided on a longer hike today, about 15.7 miles, and we added a half mile to get to the trail. We started early, 6:30 AM just as soon as there was enough light to see. It rained last night, so the trail was wet and the rocks were slippery. Then it rained just a bit more while we were on the trail, so we had to pull on our ponchos about halfway through. The headline feature story today was Angel’s Rest. This is a massive rock formation that offers impressive views of Pearisburg and environs from about 3,500 ft. But the fog and mist hung with us virtually the entire day, so we had no view—in fact, sometimes if Princess was more than 15 or 20 feet ahead of me, I couldn’t see her. And the descent from Angel’s Rest starts abruptly and is pretty steep. So it was a nice hike along a good trail through some pretty areas, but the highlight at the end wasn’t available. So, we’re set for tomorrow and plan a similar milage hike. We’ll see how that goes.","Woods Hole Hostel

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560993,"We got an extra early start today from Woods Hole (5:45 AM) to connect with Don, our shuttle driver. He took us north to Stony Creek Valley so that we could hike SoBo together back to Pearisburg. We shared the shuttle with 2 section hikers from Oregon, Ted and Peggy, doing the same hike. We knew that it was going to be a warm day and also that we would be hiking along a ridge with very few water sources. So we cameled up beforehand and made sure our water bladders were full. The elevation profile today had a long, initially steep uphill, then a very long section along a ridge with only small ups and downs, and finally a long downhill back toward Pearisburg. It rained overnight, and for the first several hours the trail was wet. So the initial climb was a little slippery, but not too bad. There were a lot of rock steps in the first part of the climb, then a huge number of switchbacks on the upper slope. We passed by a shelter on the way that appeared to be very full of hikers. Once on the ridge, we seemed to be on a shallow roller-coaster. Some parts were through open woods and others were over the rocky spine of the ridge. There were some great views of the valley through the trees—which don’t have much foliage at this point. Further southward the ridge changed to a series of hills with balds/meadows on the top. I’m not sure what the correct descriptor is, but they were grassy and provided some good vistas. The second bald sported a shelter at the top. We both remembered that one year the trail crossed a stile over a fence and then ran right past the shelter and down the hill. Today it simple crossed over the bald continued straight down the other side rather than turning and heading past the shelter. We think that perhaps one year it was rerouted to enable maintenance, and then returned to the original path afterward the trail work was completed. Certainly the blazes were very freshly painted as we crossed over the hill and a lot of recent work has been done to improve the trail. As we neared the end of the hike, storm clouds were gathering and raindrops greeted us just as we reached our car.Afterwards we checked into the MacArthur Inn in Narrows, VA. The Inn has quite a history. We stayed here before, apparently while the Inn was being renovated. This time our room is much, much nicer than our last experience and overall the Inn is in much better condition. Enough that we decided to extend our stay by at least one day and perhaps more. Plus we got a special treat this evening. Every Thursday, the proprietor hosts a dinner special (Thursday is the only day the hotel has food service). It’s a good deal with ample servings for a low price. And we learned that the Inn also hosts a Thursday night jam session with local musicians. I guess it could be called blue grass, but it ranges from jigs, to ballads, to breakdowns and some gospels. I counted 14 musicians at one point with guitars, fiddles, a mandolin, banjos and a bass. Very informal, someone would just start playing a tune they liked and the others would join in. They sat in a circle and perhaps two dozen listeners filtered in and out. We were lucky to be here on Thursday, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.","VA 641

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561221,"VA 635 to VA 601 (Friday, April 21)This is going to be a quick entry. We’re staying one more night at the MacArthur Inn in Narrows, VA. The Inn is great, clean shower, etc., laundry is close, grocery is close, but except for Thursday night, no place to eat. We were in the process of driving to Pearisburg to look for a restaurant when we saw a sign for a brewery as we drove out of our parking lot. Screeech. Turns out it’s called Right Turn, Clyde Brewery, and it opened over a year ago here in Narrows. Two friends who just like to brew beer. They have a small 10 gal setup and a bigger 75 gal rig. We tried a flight first and then followed up with a couple of pints. And we got to watch the Caps beat Montreal. Sweet.But what about the AT? A medium length trek for key swapping, I’ll talk about the NoBo version. Starting from Stony Creek, I had forgotten the section between there and the Captain’s. Particularly the couple of small, but steep hills, and the stream crossing with the big fallen tree across the rock hop. But that was manageable. The long stretch of rock jumbles going uphill to the ridge was more of a problem, tough on the ankles. No one seemed to enjoy that, but it was good practice for PA. Beyond that the trail climbed a bit more, then leveled out for a couple of miles before dropping 2,000 ft. down to Jones Creek. From there it climbed to our end point, VA 601. We’re in for a stretch of rainy weather and even turning chilly on Sunday. It’s raining tonight, so the trail will be slippery tomorrow, that’s not good since I remember an exposed narrow ridge walk. With luck the rains will diminish after the weekend.","VA 635 (Stony Creek)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561258,"Today was a bad day weather-wise. We had sporadic rain from the time we got in the car until we got to the motel. It wasn’t cold, but there was fog and mist, tree rain, and sometimes heavy showers. We did another key swap, so we both suffered. Some parts of the hike were very familiar and I could almost tell what’s changed since our last hike through here. Other parts seemed like a new trail, like I’d never been here before.I did the NoBo version again today, starting partway up the hill, finishing the climb up to the top of the ridge and a couple of miles later Kelly Knob. The sign there advertised a view, but not with the clouds hanging over the mountain today. This ridge trail is very rocky with a lot of shale to slow you down. After the Knob, there is a long downhill. A long section goes through laurel bushes that edge in very close. With all the rain today, the bushes were wet and transferred a lot of their water to me. The good news was that the trail seemed to drain in most places and slippery mud wasn’t a big issue. Near the end of the descent, the trail passed into meadows and afforded some good views of the farming landscapes in the valley. With the overcast, the colors were striking. Much of the valley is rounded hills with scattered trees and some groves around fence lines. There were a lot of dogwoods and redbuds in full bloom. I tried to get some photos, but I couldn’t keep my lens cleared so they’re not very good. Then the trail crossed several roads and started back uphill. Partway up the trail passes by the Keffer Oak, the largest oak in the south, over 300 years old. Once the trail reaches the top of the ridge (Sinking Creek Mountain I believe) and passes under several power lines, there is a long section of ridge walk. As the trail progresses north, the crest of the ridge becomes narrower and sharper. At times, the hiker has to cross the sloping sides of the ridgeline, a really creepy thing to do when the rock slabs are wet and slippery in places. The ridge seems to go on forever and what a sense of relief when you finally realize that you’re headed downhill.After the hike we headed north and now we’re settled in the Super 8 in Daleville. We had an early supper at the 3 Little Pigs down the road and had a short visit at the Flying Mouse Brewery. So here we are, 9:30 on a Saturday night and we’re beat. Hiker midnight strikes.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561346,"We’re trying to use our ""slack-packing with car” strategy to full advantage. What that means is that we’re not moving along the trail in consecutive sections, instead we’re jumping forward and we’ll come back in a day or two and do the sections that we jumped over. Our objective is to try to hike across some iconic AT features in good weather (like McAfee’s Knob, Tinker Cliffs and Dragon’s Tooth). The forecast for today was miserable weather and tomorrow is marginal, so we jumped ahead to hike a section that is less noteworthy. We’ll drive back and do the sections that we skipped on Wed or Thurs. If all goes as planned, we’ll finish everything up to the James River (meaning everything south of the James River) by the end of Thursday. Then we plan to drive back to Norfolk for the weekend, to change out some gear and check on things at home.So, this morning the forecast said rains in this area would be starting in the AM, then heavy this afternoon and overnight (including a flash flood warning). Radar showed a big system moving in slowly from the west. We decided to do a shorter hike with a key swap and there was no rain when we started. We both had an incentive to move fast (impending rain) and we both finished by noon. We were lucky and never got more than a heavy mist. I did the SoBo version from Blackhorse Gap into town. This whole section of trail is in great shape. In a lot of places it was almost like walking on a sidewalk. Much of the trail surface is a fine gravel that is easy to hike across and gives good traction on slopes. There were a couple of stream crossings and the water was up a bit from yesterday’s rains, but rock hopping was no problem. I met 9 or 10 NoBo hikers, which seems a small number to me. I didn’t stop at Fullhardt Shelter, there may have been more hikers there. Also, a significant length was on an old roadbed that had a consistent moderate slope. After showers and laundry, Princess dropped me off at the Flying Mouse Brewery in Daleville so that I could write this, and she took off to do some scouting for the next couple of hikes. Typically we like to check out the trailheads to be sure that we can access them and also to be sure there is reasonable parking where we need to leave the car. We can usually remember the trailheads we used in the past, but we sometimes break the sections up differently (use different trailheads that we’re not familiar with). The ATC section maps identify parking locations, the AWOL A.T. Guide also identifies the locations and includes the GPS coordinates as well, and finally Guthook identifies parking locations along with photos of the site, # of cars that can be accommodated, and a Google Map link. So far, in our experience, these resources are accurate. But we’ve also found some additional small parking sites and we like to be sure we can access the sites with our vehicle. Guthook and AWOL sometimes advise caution for passenger vehicles on gravel roads, and we’ve found that conditions can change over the course of a year depending on how well the gravel roads are maintained. And of course (tree) blowdowns can be a temporary problem. It would be frustrating to drive 5 miles on a narrow, rough gravel road only to find a blowdown blocking the road (and you don’t have a chainsaw). One other suggestion, we sometimes find ourselves on a gravel road in the woods looking for a trail crossing and it turns out that the crossing isn’t well marked and we can’t spot the blazes from the road. Guthook is especially useful in this situation. It will help you identify exactly where the trail crossing is located, and help you avoid driving back and forth trying to spot blazes. PS: It started raining just after noon, and it's pretty steady now at 3:00.","Daleville, VA

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561503,"From most hiker’s perspectives, this was a miserable day for hiking. It rained from start to finish (hard at times), the visibility was extremely limited, with gusting winds at higher elevations, the trail was soggy and slick in spots. The only good news was that it wasn’t too cold—high 40’s to low 50’s. We did a key swap and neither of us saw any other hikers on the trail. There is a flash flood advisory in effect and that was worrisome, but most of the hike was along ridge lines with only one significant stream crossing. I did NoBo today and started where the AT crosses the Apple Orchard Falls Trail (NoBo mm 769.1). I caught a break and started in just a light sprinkle, that lasted about 5 minutes before the serious rain resumed for the duration of our hike. The climb up Apple Orchard Mountain was about a mile and a half. Much of the trail on this side was gravelly with some rocks and well drained. There are larger rocks and boulders at the top of the hill and the trail winds around those. In the past I’ve had a good look at the FAA facility on top of the hill. Today the fog and mist severely limited visibility and I never saw the tower. As I passed over the top, the trail started down through a boulder field. There has been a lot of trail work here and the trail weaves around the boulders on a long series of stone steps. As I came around a corner I was confronted with The Guillotine, a boulder that has been caught in a crevice and hangs above the trail that passes through the crevice. I took several photos, but I couldn’t keep the rain off my camera lens so most of them are not good. I did include one silhouette of the Guillotine rock after I passed through that seems to capture the concept. Not long after that I crossed an open meadow, sort of a bald I guess. I presume that the views here were good, but I could only see 10 or 20 yards ahead (I did take a photo anyway). Also, the wind picked up substantially in the open meadow and I was anxious to get across and back into the woods. The next landmark was the Thunder Hill Shelter. I saw the sign, but couldn’t see the shelter and kept on moving.After descending to Petites Gap the trail climbed sharply to Highcock Knob and then began a long descent to the James River. By now the constant rain was overcoming the ability of the trail to drain and it was turning into a streambed. Earlier it was possible to sidestep, find rocks or roots to step on, etc. to avoid the puddles. Now, it was a matter of slogging through and I could feel the water sloshing back and forth in my boots. We were lucky today that we only had one stream crossing, Matts Creek (not far from the James River). In past years, the creek has been a simple rock hop. Today of course, the water was much higher. Princess told me when we met that she was still able to get across on the rocks so I tried as well. I’m not as confident on wet rocks. Not all the rocks were above water, but enough that I made it without slipping in. The water did not look pleasant. On a positive note, Princess spotted several blooming rhododendrons. The first one she saw was just beginning to bloom and she took a photo. Later she saw blooms that had opened.","Apple Orchard Falls Trail

We should be out of the system by the end of the day. Flash flood announcements for the area were unsettling. The stream crossings in today’s section have bridges, so that shouldn’t be a problem.I did the SoBo direction, starting at Jennings Creek. The creek was more like a river, well out of it’s banks with brown, muddy water. Good news, the AT crossed that swollen creek on VA 614. The rain was pretty much continuous and the view was the same as yesterday—just fog and mist. I realized early in the hike that I forgot my camera (first time), so I uses my iPhone for a few pics. I keep the phone in a plastic waterproof case, so the photos aren’t very good. Turning the phone on, punching in the password and pulling up the camera were a pain with the phone inside the case and with gloves. So I didn’t take many shots. Princess ran into trouble in driving to Blackhorse Gap, the southern end of today’s section. Our nav system identified a short route from Jennings Creek to the Blue Ridge Parkway, but she found a tree blocking the road and had to backtrack and take another route to the BRP. The trail was in good shape, especially considering the heavy rains. I never had trouble with traction and all the water control features on the trail seemed to be working well. I met 2 trail maintainers from the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club on the trail, and I thanked them for their efforts. My highlight today was azaleas, there were several bushes right alongside the trail up on the ridge. We tried a new restaurant for dinner, the Pomegranite in Troutsville and we really enjoyed it. We had a long conversation with a friend of the owner who has spent time in the Norfolk/VABeach area and supplies fresh greens and vegetables for the restaurant. Our dinners were outstanding and we plan to return tomorrow night.The rain finally quit this afternoon and the clouds are starting to break.

Our plan was to hike together back to our room in Daleville at the Super 8 which is almost adjacent to the AT. We put off this section to wait on good weather and it worked. No rain appeared today, although there was residual water at a few places on the trail and a relatively low cloud layer on the mountains when we started.Kevin dropped us off at the AT parking lot at the base of the climb up to McAfee Knob and we started immediately up the 3.9 mile trail to the Knob. The cloud layer kept us cool early in the steady climb and it took us almost 2 hours to get up. We met 4 hikers coming down, we assumed they climbed early for the sunrise. By the time we reached the top the cloud layer had burned off the top of the mountain, but lower level clouds covered many of the distant slopes. The knob area was devoid of hikers, so we were able to take photos and absorb the incredible view, then move on quickly. Tinker Cliffs were the next target. To get there we had a steep descent from McAfee, then a long walk across a curved ridge with several hills and finally a one and a half mile steep climb up to Tinker Cliffs. Near the top, the trail winds through some immense boulders and finally ascends to the edge of the cliff. While we were traversing to Tinker, the low level clouds essentially disappeared providing really spectacular views of the valley to the west. Then the AT follows the cliff as it swings around to the east, in places only a couple of feet from the edge. Massive boulder blocks have separated from the main cliff in places. Next comes a long descent.At this point we were halfway through the hike. We remembered some ups from previous years, but neither of us remembered the long ridge walk along Carvin Cove Reservoir. After a couple of hours of moderate ups and downs, the ridge narrowed and we began a series of sharp ups and downs as we moved across a number of rocky knobs along the crest of the ridge. All of this while the temperature was rising above what we have been used to recently. Eventually after crossing under several huge power lines, the trail turned down for a long descent into Daleville. We met about 8 hikers on the way to Tinker. At the Tinker Cliffs, we found 1st Sarge and talked with him for a while. And then Friendly Ghost and Beetle a little further around the cliffs. From that point, we didn’t see anyone until we encountered a number of day hikers who appeared to have started at Daleville.

This is a large monolithic formation at the end of a ridge. After climbing some tough rocks for over a mile, a sign on the trail warns that the next mile will be worse?? To me the climb seems like a long series of individual tests like climbing up a crevice, or working around a ledge, or scrambling up over re-bar. There has been a great deal of work on the trail to provide a path (including some stone steps) to make it a lot easier. And it is well-blazed, often you can’t see the path until you get partway up but it’s always there. The climb is challenging, but not the toughest on the trail. Going SoBo, after the Dragonstooth climb, there is a ridge walk that descends slowly, then a long climb up Brush Mountain. The memorial to Audie Murphy is near the top. And finally a long descent to the Craig Creek area.
I confess, after the Thursday hike, we climbed into the car and headed back to Norfolk, VA. I planned to write my description of Thursday’s hike on the 4 hour drive back home, but it didn’t happen. And we had a positively great time spending the weekend in Norfolk. We went through our mail, took care of some appointments, did some chores and went to dinner with friends that we haven’t seen in a couple of months. I’ve included some photos of the Norfolk weekend for our friends. Thursday evening we had dinner with our Trail Boss, Alan at Leone’s Italian Restaurant rooftop. We don’t ask as much of him in recent years as we did in 2014. Now we have the Post Office keep our mail and since we’re slacking we don’t need him to send mail drops.  But he’s always been willing to help out with anything. And a really good friend, Lorraine, joined us as well. She was a backup trail boss for us. Friday we took care of routine chores and then had a great dinner with Fred & Sarah at Byrd & Baldwin. They (extravagantly) brought a truly delicious bottle of a very special wine that was the centerpiece of a vinous evening.  Saturday was a busy day. We had brunch with Alan in front of The 219 Bistro and stayed while the 2017 NATOfest parade of nations went past on Granby St. We got to meet a delegation from Singapore that Alan was hosting who participated in the Virginia International Tattoo (which performed for 4 nights) presented by the Virginia Arts Festival.  (I forgot to mention the French Air Force fighter flyover.) Next we toured the tents that each of the NATO countries hosted at Town Point Park on the waterfront and were treated to a performance by an incredible choral group from New Jersey. This was also the 20th anniversary of the Virginia Arts Festival which was also a contributing partner in the NATOfest weekend activities. After the park adventure we had drinks at the incredible new Hilton Hotel (The Main) that has just opened 2 blocks from our condo. We went to the Grain Restaurant on an upper floor and sat at one of their outside garden patios (an unbelievable number of craft beers on tap). Saturday evening we returned to the B&B restaurant for dinner with our neighbor Ron and Fred.  Sunday morning we had brunch with a number of friends, including Alan, Lorraine, Pete and his young daughter Georgie, Greg and Eileen, and two ex-Norfolk neighbors, Joe and Paula, who were visiting relatives in the area. We had a grand time. We spent the afternoon pulling out our summer hiking gear and packing. Then we had one more dinner at the B&B restaurant with Alan, Sherry and Preston. By the end of the weekend, we were more tired that if we had been hiking. But rejuvenated. 
On Monday morning we finished our Norfolk duties and headed north to Washington, DC to take care of a few things there. Finally, on Tuesday morning, we left DC early in the morning and headed toward Harper’s Ferry to switch back into AT hiker mode.","Craig Creek (VA 621)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563421,"Today was a great day to get back in the hiking groove after our weekend at home. We got up early in DC and drove to the Harpers Ferry area. We did a key swap on a relatively easy, short section that runs through the town of Harpers Ferry (where we plan to stay for the next couple of days). We did some prep hikes in this area before we even started the AT in 2014, so we’ve been over this territory a number of times. I’ll talk about my NoBo version (Princess did it SoBo).
Keys Gap is easily accessible from Harpers Ferry and has a nice parking lot just off WV 9.  We started later than usual since we drove out from DC this morning, but the weather was fantastic. The temp started out in the 60’s, then quickly climbed close to 80 — definitely at the upper end of comfort for us. There was a decent breeze and enough leaves to provide shade from the sun so I have no complaints. 
There are some rocky sections on the WV piece, but not many noteworthy features. The trail follows along the VA/WV state border for some distance then makes a final crossing over into WV that puts an end to the long Virginia section of the AT and starts the very short West Virginia section. About the same time the trail starts a descent toward the Shenandoah River. At the river it swings to the NE and provides some nice views of the river until it reaches and crosses the US 340 bridge over the river.
Once across the river, the AT climbs partway up the ridge and follows along the ridge into downtown Harpers Ferry. Along the way it passes Jefferson Rock and a blue blaze turnoff that leads to the HQ of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that manages the whole length of the AT. I always take a photo of Jefferson Rock. I don’t know much about the landmark, but it’s very picturesque. Beyond that the trail passes directly through the downtown Harpers Ferry district and past the historical landmarks associated with John Brown’s attack on the federal facility at Harpers Ferry. 
From there the AT goes directly across the Potomac River on a screened in footbridge. The footbridge is adjacent to several sets of train tracks that are very active. Its quite possible that a train will pass by while a hiker is on the bridge and it’s a noisy experience. Once across the bridge, you’re finished with West Virginia and into Maryland. Just downstream of the bridge the Shenandoah River flows into the Potomac River. The remainder of our hike today was along the tow path associated with the C&O canal. This is a long (endless) stretch of a flat path. You would think that a flat section would be appreciated after all the ups & downs, but it really gets monotonous. For me the two interesting features of the walk are the river on one side, and the turtles in the canal on the other side. The canal doesn’t really flow, but there are sections of green moss-covered standing water that seems to be full of turtles. On any warm, sunny day they climb out of the water onto any fallen logs they can find and sun themselves. I’ve included photos of them in the past, and I took another this year. After 3+ miles of canal walk, the trail turns left across the canal, a railroad, along a creek and eventually to a parking lot at the base of Weverton Cliffs where the car was waiting.
After hiking, we drove back into Harpers Ferry and checked into The Towns Inn. Not long after we unloaded the car and cleaned up, Princess’ brother Ranger and his wife, Gay arrived. Princess had made arrangements for a large room to accommodate all of us. They didn’t plan to hike with us. Instead they wanted to take a mini-vacation for 2 days and see the sights in and around Harpers Ferry. We walked around town and then learned that there is essentially no place to eat in Harpers Ferry after about 5:00. An Italian restaurant was open, but full. So we ended up driving toward Charles Town where we eventually found a good place to eat. We’ll have to plan better tomorrow. Harpers Ferry really rolls up the sidewalks early.","Keys Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563538,"Today we headed further north and hiked the next section of trail north of Weverton Road. We did a key swap between Weverton and Turners Gap. From the SoBo perspective, this starts at the restaurant parking lot just off US Alt. 40. Not much more than a quarter mile south the AT passes the Dahlgren Back Pack Camping area run by Maryland. Maryland provides a number of nice features along the trail and the AT along this section is really in great shape. A little further along there is a creamery that is popular with hikers, but it’s considerably off the trail and we’ve never visited. Also, about a mile and a half further (and up) there is a road to a tower and neither of us checked that out either—perhaps next year?
The next most prominent SoBo landmark is the War Correspondent’s Memorial at Gathland State Park. This is an impressive monument, I’ve never seen anything like it. From the front it appears to be the front wall of a structure that incorporates considerable artwork. The explanatory plaques around the monument explain the symbolism of the artwork. And there are additional descriptions of the Civil War battles that took place in this vicinity, leading up to the battle at Antietam which is just west of here. Apparently skirmishes all along South Mountain played an important role in the prelude to Antietam. Also, at the north end of the park area there are remnants of an old stone structure dated 1887. 
Three or four miles south of the monument is Ed Garvey shelter. I saw photos of this shelter later in Guthook and I wished that I took time to check it out, but I moved on past. A mile or so after the shelter the trail started descending, at times over and through considerable rocks. Good rock practice for later in PA. Finally I reached the side trail to the cliff overlook. I took some pics there several years ago, so I passed it up this time and headed down. From the point of the overlook trail the AT starts a sharp descent with switchbacks and through several rock fields, eventually coming out at the Weverton Cliffs parking lot—my end point.
After the hike, there was time to check out some of the shops in the lower historic district at Harpers Ferry and we were able to eat at the Towns Inn restaurant. (We learned that most of the nearby restaurants in Harpers Ferry and Bolivar routinely close on Tuesday so you may want to factor this into your plans if you visit.)
Tomorrow we plan to check out in the morning and set up at Bears Den in Virginia after our hike.","Turners Gap (Alt. 40)

Thurs, May 4
Chilly start today, but otherwise a nice day for hiking. Princess’ brother Ranger dropped us off at Keys Gap and then drove to Bears Den and left our car there. Ranger and his wife Gay have been visiting for the past two days and are now headed back to Blue Ridge, VA. The first portion of the hike was uneventful with few noteworthy landmarks. The trail was in good shape, we passed some large rock formations, and we crossed the state line from WVa back into VA (we were both heading SoBo). 
The most interesting feature was the start of the “Rollercoaster” in VA, described as 13.5 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents. We entered at the north end of the ‘coaster’, headed toward an overnight stop at the Bears Den Hostel, so we only tasted a few of the ups and downs before reaching the hostel. But it was a good taste. It’s been much warmer when I’ve done this stretch in the past. Today was not as tough in the cooler weather. 
The Bears Den Hostel is a wonderful place to stay. I believe that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy owns the property and it’s managed by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. So it’s tailor made for hikers. I’ve talked about it in previous years, so I won’t repeat. It’s comfortable, has everything that a hiker needs and the caretaker and staff are responsive and supportive of hikers. Besides AT thru-hikers there are day hikers and section hikers. There is a bunk room and hikers can camp on the facility if they desire.
After settling in to the hostel this afternoon, we made an excursion to the Dirt Farm Brewery that is not far from the hostel. Princess treated me by taking on the designated driver responsibilities so that I could sample their wares. And I did. The brewery is on a spectacular piece of property with a tasting facility on top of a hill that commands an incredible view of the valley (see photo). It’s the most picturesque property that I’ve ever seen (for a brewery). It’s out in farm country and they grow their own hops. Great beers (I really liked Fluster Cluck). Enough said.","Keys Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563541,"We have known all week that today was going to be a very wet day. Initially, the rain was predicted to start last night and continue all day today and that’s what happened. We had the good fortune to avoid thunderstorms, but there was a great deal of rain. 
We woke before dawn at the Bears Den Hostel and as dawn crept in, we saw that we were completely socked in and that it had been raining most of the night. It was hard to leave the dry comfort of the hostel, but we finally did. We did a key swap that took us all the way to Signal Knob. It rained on both of us most of the way. Most of the time it was moderate, but we both experienced a very heavy rain band that seemed like a cloudburst. There were numerous stream crossings and each was a challenge. For the most part the streams didn’t seem to rise a lot over the rocks, they got wider instead of deeper. So instead of being 5 or 10 feet across they were 20 or 30 feet across. Most of the streams weren't deep enough to present a drowning hazard, but there was a real risk of slipping on a rock and ending up with boots full of water or even falling down and getting all of your gear soaked. Great news: neither of us had those problems. We both managed to rock-hop all of the streams without mishap. 
That’s not to say that we weren’t thoroughly wet anyway. I don’t think there was any way to avoid getting wet. We were going through the Rollercoaster and often the trail was literally a sluice, full of flowing water. What’s most remarkable is that neither of us slipped as we climbed and descended some very rocky and muddy slopes (find some wood to knock on).
I tried to take some photos, but I couldn’t keep the lens dry so they’re very smeary. I saw turtles, frogs and toads for the first time today. Most of my shots were photos of stream crossings. Believe me, the stream crossings were a lot more challenging in person than they appear to be in the pics. 
Both of us saw other hikers on the trail, but not many. We both saw 2 hikers in shorts, tees and sneakers with very light packs that appeared to be running the trail. Nobody looked happy with the conditions, but most seemed to take it in stride. At least Princess and I have a warm inside bed tonight after a shower, most of the others are spending the night in a tent or shelter with a lot of wet soggy gear. The sun popped out a few times this afternoon, but interspersed with showers. After the hike I changed out of the wet shoes and clothes in the car. It’s amazing how a dry set of clothes can change your outlook.
We changed our base again this afternoon and relocated to the Lackawanna B&B in Front Royal, VA. The Lackawanna is very nice, but at the expensive end of our spectrum. We made the reservations several days ago and most of the accommodations in the Front Royal area were booked. So we’ll be here for 2 days. The owners (Sandra and Phil) relocated from the northern VA area and remodeled an old home and did a great job. It has all the amenities except laundry—there is a very nice laundromat downtown, but transportation would be a problem without a car.
Princess treated me to another brewery excursion, this time to the Backroom Brewery. This is another farm country brewery similar to Dirt Farm that we visited yesterday. It has a different atmosphere, but also very popular with all the seats occupied at the tasting bar. Backroom also offered a more extensive menu than other tasting rooms and the food was delicious. 
There is still a significant chance of rain tomorrow, so the wet woes may continue. I hope not.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563616,"This will be a short entry. I got behind and I’m trying to catch up from memory. I’ll try to do better in the future. 
The rains were supposed to end yesterday, so I thought. But when we woke up at the Lackawanna B&B this morning it still looked like rain and the morning forecast indicated that the probability was going to increase mid-morning. At least we managed to dry all our hiking gear so we had a clean start. In fact, the rains restarted before we finished and we both got soaked again. Neither of us took many pics. 
I did stop briefly at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter since it’s very close to the AT. It looks very comfortable with nice Adirondack chairs on a front deck and double decker bunks. There’s also a covered table and horseshoe pits. Most of the rest of my photos are streams that were overflowing their banks and covering the rocks. Some well-placed logs helped me get across one busy stream. None of them were really dangerous, once I realized that I couldn’t keep my feet dry. There were some helpful plank walks and puncheons—but not enough. I did see one intrepid volunteer trail maintainer who was busy with a weed whacker clearing tall grass & weeds from a section of trail. It was pouring rain--I was soaked, he was soaked and the trail was soaked. I thanked him for his efforts and said I was surprised to see him out in such miserable weather. He said Saturday was the only day he had time to get out on the trail. Giving up a piece of your weekend to help maintain the AT is pretty impressive.
After the hike, we headed back to the laundromat and washed and dried all our gear for the second day in a row. Then we headed into Front Royal for lunch. We stumbled onto a re-enactment of the Front Royal Battle during the Civil War, complete with cannon and gunfire. It included a band concert with Southern musical selections. Then it was a matter of heading back to the Lackawanna B&B and packing things up to checkout early Sunday morning.","Signal Knob

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563619,"We were up and out of the Lackawanna B&B early this AM, we had a long drive to our hiking section. Yesterday we finished up Virginia and we have already jumped ahead and finished West Virginia and a big chunk of Maryland. It’s hard to keep track, but since October, 2016 we’ve finished all the AT NoBo up to Turners Gap (US Alt. 40) or mile marker 1041.2. Today we skipped one section ahead and actually set foot in PA. However, we have one more MD section before we’re officially in PA and we plan to do that tomorrow. We key swapped again today. I’ll give the NoBo version. 
Little Antietam Creek presented a small challenge a couple of miles into the hike. We heard reports that it was very difficult yesterday (like mid-thigh) during the heavy rains. But the water was much lower today. Several rocks were under the surface and there was a long jump, but it was doable with just a wet foot. Next was a tough climb up to Raven Rock Cliff (didn’t stop to see the shelter) and a couple of miles later a nasty rocky trail down from the High Rock area. The markings here weren’t very clear, but some orange flags near the bottom helped. 
The Pen Mar Park was close to the midpoint of the hike. It’s located very close to the state border between PA and MD, hence the name. I’ve never taken the time to fully explore the features, but the AT passes a pavillion and a great view out across the valley. And not far beyond that a sign marks the “Mason-Dixon Line” between MD and PA.
After another hill, the trail flattens out for a while and hikers can make good time. There are several shelters in this area, an older shelter and two newer facilities that each have two separate smaller shelters. Maybe one is for snorers? The last climb in this section was a long ascent up to Chimney Rocks. A blue blaze trail heads east to the actual rocks and view that neither of us took. From there the trail flattens, weaves through some rocks and then heads down to our northern end point at PA 233.
There were some initial sprinkles today, but nothing like Friday. The morning was cool and overcast, and later the clouds broke a bit and some sun popped through.  We both started with ponchos, but quickly packed them away. After the hike we headed for our next base at Burgundy Lane B&B in Waynesboro, PA. On the way we took a short detour to check out the Roy Pitz Brewing Company in Chambersburg, PA. It turned out to be a great stop, we net some nice folks and we had a late lunch. Then we headed to Burgundy Lane. We’ve stayed here for several years and it’s a favorite of ours. Margaret and David are super hosts and they really cater to hikers. We highly recommend them. We plan to stay here for 3 nights.
Tomorrow we fill in the last gap in MD.","Foxville Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563843,"We had an early breakfast this morning. One of the attractive features of Burgundy Lane is that David and Margaret ask when you would like breakfast and they’re willing to accommodate. So we had a nice ham & eggs breakfast at 6:00. That gives us an early start and we can avoid some of the heat that builds up in the afternoon. Of course heat wasn’t a problem today. In fact I pulled out the toboggan and heavy arm warmers. We expected 30’s up the hill and were surprised to see low 40’s when we got to the trail. However, there was a stiff breeze in the open places, so we kept a brisk pace. It was good to see plenty of sunshine.
Today’s section was another fill-in, we have already hiked the sections to the north and south. It wasn’t a long section, so a key swap was fine and I’ll describe it from a NoBo perspective. Starting from Turners Gap by the restaurant, there was a good warm-up climb up to the Washington Monument area. Maryland has a very nice park at the top with picnic tables, a visitor center and restrooms, all very neat and well-kept. From the visitors center the trail winds up the hill toward the monument and there are signs all along the way that chronicle the major events in George Washington’s life. And there is a small shelter with a huge fireplace at the base of the hill that requires a permit to use (no bunk accommodations, only picnic tables inside).
The AT turns near the top of the hill and there is a short path up the last few steps to the monument. The monument was open and I took the small spiral stairs inside to the viewing area on top. It provided a magnificent long view to the west with signs that identified visible  landmarks and features. The monument is really the highlight of this section. This seems to be a popular section for day hikers, the trail is easy and we saw some folks without any packs who were just out to walk for a couple of hours. The trail is easy and wide. 
A couple of miles to the north the trail comes out of the woods, crosses a road, passes through a residential strip and crosses a pedestrian bridge across I-70. This has always been fun for me since I’ve passed under this bridge maybe a hundred times and read the sign that identifies it as the Appalachian Trail. Once when I was a passenger I had the camera ready and took a photo from the car of the footbridge with the sign. 
Beyond that is the second climb of the day past Pine Knob Shelter and eventually to the Annapolis Rocks and Black Rocks area. Both areas have viewpoints, but both are off the trail, so neither of us went there. There was about a mile of tough rocks that really slowed us down. Eventually the trail dropped to Wolfsville Rd. and then climbed back up to our end point at Foxsville Rd. 
Afterwards, we took advantage of our car and drove to the Appalachian Brewing Company in Gettysburg for lunch. They have a fine slate of beers and I tried a flight of 8 (Princess paid her dues as designated driver). Then back to Burgundy Lane in Waynesboro. We’ve found a couple of good restaurants in town, yesterday we ate at Sapporo and this evening at Cafe del Sol. Last year we like Christine’s, but they don’t have evening dining until Thursday and we’ll be gone.","Turners Gap (Alt. 40)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564007,"We’re really getting comfortable here in Waynesboro. The AT here in south-central PA has been in good shape. We had some taste of rocks, but nothing really nasty yet. Today we headed on northward from PA 233. The first part of the section up to Caledonia Park had some tough spots, tough climb after that, Quarry Gap Shelter is always a high point, then another long climb, and finally a long, mostly flat walk to Shippensburg.
On the first section, the trail climbed Rocky Mountain to a position just below a rocky ridge and followed the ridge for a time. Periodically the AT abruptly climbed to the top of the ridge and tracked through a rocky knob, then dropped back down just below the ridge again. The sections on the top of the ridge were challenging and more fun than I’ve had for a while, good practice for later in PA. Then the trail descended to Rt. 30 and Caledonia Park. 
Caledonia Park looked impressive to me today. The facilities seem to be spruced up and workmen were busy tuning up sections of the AT while I was passing through. Of course it is a weekday and there were few patrons in the park. But I passed straight through on the trail and didn’t spend much time there.
The climb north of the park is a chug for me, followed by a narrow path through rhodo bushes and then the trail heads up to the Quarry Gap Shelter. Each time I pass by this shelter I see improvements. It has dual shelter buildings with a covered section between. There’s a separate roof over another table, a lawn swing (new I think), several tent platforms, a food storage bin, a masonry fire pit, a sundial, and a brook that passes in front of the shelter — even a hanging flower pot. Certainly the most impressive shelter that I have seen.
North of the shelter is a long climb up seemingly endless log steps, sometime I want to count how many. Eventually the climb ends at a 5-way gravel road intersection. I had some trouble following the trail through the intersection, but Guthook was helpful. The rest of the section was a relatively easy slightly downhill walk compared to the first part. It included 2 shelters, Birch Run Shelter and Toms Shelter.
The morning started out chilly with temps dipping into the 30’s and frost warnings. But we didn’t get to the trail heads until later in the morning and the temp warmed quickly. All-in-all it was a great day for hiking. Afterwards, we decided to revisit the Roy Pitz Brewing Company and have a late lunch. Then we headed back to Waynesboro and Burgundy Lane for our last night there. We liked Sapporo so much on Sunday that we decided to return for a late dinner and we were pleased.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564013,"Finally I’m almost caught up on my TJ blogs. This entry will bring me up to date. I really need to write these up at the end of the day. If I get behind, I have a hard time remembering what the hike was like. 
I guess today would be hard to forget, it was a very pleasant day on the trail. Fabulous weather and a well-maintained trail. We did a key swap between Shippensburg Rd. and Rt. 43. The first portion of the trail was the toughest. Rocks, streams and mud seemed to predominate. That’s not to say that there weren’t any easy stretches, but you tend to remember the hard spots. There were several streams to cross and lots of mud. Often you can avoid the mud by tramping around the mudhole on the side of the trail, but that can lead to brambles and other problems. 
This section is memorable since it includes the halfway point on the AT. I’ve included a photo of the “ceremonial” mid-point. But the actual mid-point of the entire trail varies each year since the length of the trail changes, largely due to rerouting that the trail clubs do to maintain the trail. Anyway, there is a sign that celebrates the approximate mid-point (1,090.5 miles). Usually there is another smaller sign along the trail that denotes the actual mid-point based on the current year length of the AT. Neither of us saw that sign this time, but there was a 1100 sign done with rocks. 
The other highlight of the section is the IronMasters Mansion located in Pine Grove. We have stayed here in the past, but this year we decided to stay off-trail instead. The Mansion is right on the trail and it’s co-located with the AT Museum and a General Store. The General Store is famous among hikers as the site of the “Half-Gallon Challenge”. I suspect that years ago there really was a challenge, and if anyone could eat a whole half-gallon they received a prize (perhaps the ice cream was free). Now, hikers have to pay for the ice cream, regardless of their consumption performance. Plus, now-a-days they don’t really sell “half-gallons”, the packs are actually 3 points. So if a hiker still wants to claim bragging rights, they have to eat an extra pint in addition to the 3-pint pack. So it’s complicated. In the past, we’ve done it with either vanilla or mint chocolate chip. But this year, the General Store was closed. I don’t know why — maybe too early in the season? Who knows?
After passing through the park (I captured a nice shot of a lake in the park), there is a very long uphill section. It didn’t seem so tough this time, I’m sure the lighter slack-pack helps and I wasn’t so aggressive. After that, the rest of the section is not too hard. There is one boulder section that slows you down, but it doesn’t last long and that’s about it.
I did see another sizable black snake. It was sunning itself across the trail and I got a couple of photos. The snake could care less about me and virtually never moved. I guess it’s still a little cool for snakes.","Shippensburg Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564204,"We got going really early today to try to beat as much of the rain as possible. I dropped Princess off for the NoBo version just after 6:00 am. It wasn’t raining at that point, but the probability of rain zoomed mid- to late-morning. For the NoBo perspective, there was a gentle climb, a descent and then the Maze. This is a tortuous path through a big pile of large boulders. Maybe we’re getting familiar with it, but it seems like it’s getting easier. I’ve done it both NoBo and SoBo and there appear to be more blazes in strategic locations. There was one point where Princess had a challenge climbing up and over a big rock. And there’s a second verse right after the first. There’s also a tough NoBo descent down a boulder pile. The next 3 miles are a series of ups and downs leading up to Center Point Knob where there’s a stone marker at the original AT center point. In 2014 I didn’t notice the double blaze on the marker and walked right past it down the wrong path until Princess hailed me back to the turn in the trail. From that point, the trail drops down to the Cumberland Valley and it’s mostly flat from that point on.
Once the hiker comes out of the woods, it’s a long walk across several open fields and eventually into Boiling Springs. Downtown is very picturesque, there’s a large lagoon in the center of town and the AT passes through a park area along the side of the water. At the end of the lagoon is the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office and many hikers stop by to check it out. Then the AT makes an abrupt right turn and heads directly out of town along a busy highway without sidewalks. The blazes are on the right-hand side, seems to me they should be on the left, especially since the trail turns left at the edge of town.
The trail is a relatively flat walk for the next 12 miles or so across the valley. It weaves back and forth along the boundaries of farm fields. Much of the path is through a narrow strip of woods between farms and it crosses a railroad, several interstates and a number of other local roads. The north end of today’s section was just after crossing Conodoguinet Creek which was flowing full and fast today. Scott Farm is at the northern end of the bridge, it’s an ATC Crew Facility. Hikers can get water there from a spigot (avoid the creek water) and there is usually a portable privy on the side of the barn. Hikers usually take a break there and there are picnic tables under an overhang. 
The weather was mostly kind to us today. It was overcast, but it didn’t start to sprinkle until we were nearly finished. The rain gradually picked up around lunch and early afternoon, but mostly quit later in the day. We should be able to finish tomorrow before the rains, but Saturday is looking wet.
I didn’t mention yesterday that we booked into the Allenberry Resort and we’re staying here tonight as well. We stayed here in 2014 and 2015, but the facility was really beginning to look run down. Last year we learned that it was closed. This year it showed up in the AT guides, so we gave it another try. It’s being renovated (not all the rooms are open) and we’re very happy with our room. We haven’t found an abundance of accommodations around Boiling Springs, so it’s good to have another option. And the restaurant here is very good, we’ve had dinner here both nights. The B&B where we stayed last year has closed.","PA 34

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564359,"Today we picked up where we left off yesterday, at Scotts Farm. There are a few access points along the way, so we decided to split the hike into 3 sub-sections, and did a key swap on each. The first section just north of Scotts Farm is in a low area along the creek. There are multiple bridges and plank walks, but the trailbed was surprisingly dry and firm. After passing through a tunnel under PA 944, the trail started a long steady climb. There were plenty of rocks in the upper parts and some switchbacks with well-made stone steps. There was also a stone bench crafted into the hillside across from an opening in the trees yielding a long-range vista. Eventually the trail leveled out at the top and there is an intersection with another trail (Tuscarora Trail). A short distance further is a side trail to the Darlington Shelter. I was tempted to visit since AWOL advertises a “Taj Mahal” privy, but I didn’t feel the need so I moved on by. Princess passed it up also, neither of us remembers ever checking it out. Shortly after passing the shelter I met 2 SoBo hikers, the only hikers I met until reaching Duncannon. 
From there it was a downhill and then back up through woods. And finally the trail opened up to a series of grassy meadows, tall grass still wet from the dew that wets down boots & pants legs. A man pulled into the parking lot at PA 850 and I talked with him briefly. His name is Mike Burton (I hope I got that right), and he was restocking a trail magic cooler. A really nice fellow. He said he stopped at the lot some time ago and it was a mess with hiker trash & debris, etc. He said it was totally unacceptable, so he brought out a trail magic cooler and a bag for trash. I didn’t see any litter in the lot, so his strategy seems to be working well. He agreed to the attached photo. 
Our middle section was the biggest of the day, comprising the ridge walk leading into Duncannon. It started with a wet walk through more meadows and then a climb to the ridge. The ridge is rocky, but not boulders like the maze, just a lot of trail rocks, and it goes on for about 5 miles. Lelia found a couple of lady slippers nestled in the rocks that I didn’t see. Usually there is a great view of the valley from Hawk Rock including a portion of Duncannon and a piece of the Susquehanna River. But the weather today was overcast with low clouds, so the view was not good. Then a long rocky descent into Duncannon. After about 3/4 mile, a NoBo hiker thinks the descent is almost over, then the trail branches to the right and heads back up over rocks for a while until it finally drops down to Inn Rd at the bottom. That last branch was a reroute of the original trail that went straight down into town.
Our last subsection was short, a walk from the (relatively new) parking lot on Inn Rd through Duncannon and across the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers to the parking lot on the north end of Clarks Ferry Bridge. As usual, I had to take a photo of the Doyle Hotel. There is a long section of trail down High St. in Duncannon. After hiking on High for a while I came across a house painter (who had his back turned to me). He was busy washing out his brushes and tools into a wash bucket. When I was only a few feet away (still didn’t see me) he picked up his bucket, walked over to the curb and poured the bucket full of water & white paint into the street and it headed down a storm drain, probably into the river. I guess that will be OK when we get rid of the EPA and all those repressive regulations. But it’s still not OK in the town where I live.
While today was chilly at the start and overcast all day, tomorrow is projected to be in the low 50’s with rain likely all day until tomorrow evening. But if the weather guys are right (unlikely), next week will be dry and progressively warmer—even touching 90 on Thursday. I’m such a cynic.
Once again, we’re taking advantage of having our car and we’re staying at a motel in Harrisburg. We checked out the Millworks Brewery this afternoon and I sampled their IPAs. Life is good.","Scotts Farm (ATC Crew Facility)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564477,"Today was just one of those days you have to work through. The weather forecast was spot on: it rained last night, it was raining when we started at 7 this morning, and it was raining when we finished. The clouds and mist hung over the mountain, so absolutely no views. We never had a hard driving rain and the wind wasn’t a factor so it was tolerable, just not pleasant. When we started, we both took a guess at how many hikers we would see and we were really wrong. We both guessed a half dozen and by the end of the hike we tallied over 35. 
We were able to hike together SoBo today. We met Trail Angel Mary in Duncannon, parked our car at the north end of the Clarks Ferry Bridge  and then she drove us out to the trailhead at PA 325 (Clarks Creek). It’s never easy climbing out of a warm comfortable van, putting on your gear and your poncho, and then watching the van drive away. At that point you’re fully committed.
We saw a few hikers we recognized, but since we moved ahead to Harpers Ferry we’re now in a new stream of folks. I suspect that some of them started a flip-flop at Harpers Ferry. Angel Mary said hikers have been coming through Duncannon at a pretty good rate, so maybe the ATC support for FF is paying off. We learned that Mary is planning a trip back to Damascus next week for Trail Days, which is next weekend. We’ve always said we’d like to go, but never actually made the trip. 
Good news, Angel Mary is responding well to chemo. When we were here last year she was just starting. She’s had some complications and has lost weight, but she seems to have weathered them well and is very positive. 
Doing this section SoBo means saving all the serious rocks until near the end of the hike. After crossing Peters Mountain Rd, the trail begins a series of ups and downs and many involve climbing over some large boulders. Eventually the trail starts a descent, but crosses over the ridge several times. The rocks are really fun and good practice for some of the trail features a little further north in PA. We met a number of hikers in the last part of the hike coming up from Duncannon. They probably waited until later in the morning to start hoping the rain would abate. It didn’t.
We’re spending another evening in Harrisburg. We’ve been exploring brewpubs and tonight’s target was Ever Grain. They have a really impressive operation and since it’s Saturday, the place was booming—full of people. I know this is a hiker journal and not a sightseeing blog, but I highly recommend a visit if anyone can manage the transportation.
Tonight our gear is drying out and tomorrow we’ve asked Angel Mary to take us further out on the AT so that we can hike back to our car and stay one more night in Harrisburg. And the weather looks good for tomorrow and the week. In fact, in a couple of days I’ll be complaining about the heat.","North End Clarks Ferry Bridge (US 22/322)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564588,"The strategy today was similar to yesterday, we drove our car to the end point of today’s hike, then Trail Angel Mary (a Mother”s Day Honoree) shuttled us from that point to our starting point. So then all we needed to do was to hike SoBo to our car and then drive back to our motel. A drawback is that the drive to our end point for the day took about a half hour (since we’re further north on the trail), and the shuttle from there to our starting point took almost an hour. But everything went smoothly and we were ready to start hiking by 8:00 am. We did take a few moments in the parking lot to snap a couple of photos with Mary. It was great seeing her again. She does a tremendous amount for the hikers and she helps the ATC as well. She is truly a Trail Angel.
Today’s hike was relatively easy, mostly flat, well-maintained trail, nice weather. There were plenty of rocks, but that’s par for the course in PA. My only comment is that I didn’t take many photos since today’s section doesn’t have too many unique features. Rausch Gap is interesting, I should learn more about it’s history. It’s a very pretty setting, in beautiful trees along a stream, we didn’t visit—but we were told that the shelter is first-rate, the campsite is neatly set along the stream, etc. And Yellow Springs is another defunct coal-mining town left in ruins. That’s not to say that it wasn’t a super hike. Mostly a woods trail, up and over Second Mountain, down through Rausch Gap, then up Sharp Mountain and along the ridge, and finally crossing Stony Mountain down to PA 325 
The stonework at the end of the trail, descending from Stony Mountain was impressive. It’s a long stretch of stone steps and carefully placed rocks to form a navigable path down. I can’t imagine the work-years of labor invested in moving and positioning those rocks. Of course, at that point we were descending. We met a number of hikers who were climbing and they looked bushed. I’m not sure that they were admiring the stonework.
We encountered a lot of NoBo hikers on the trail, many that we remembered from our SoBo hike yesterday. One that we remember is Hank who is flip-flopping with his dog Brody. We also met 2 section hikers, Marsh and Fillman, who had great things to say about Rausch Gap Shelter. Others we have met before include Mystical and Dakota. 
One other observation about today’s hike: most of the day we heard loud explosive noises. They were intermittent and at first I thought it was probably hunters. Later another hiker suggested that they were coal mining operations (truck loading, etc.). But near the end we met a hiker who was taking a break and he said they were likely associated with a nearby military base. He suggested that we were hearing the boom of the artillery fire and a few seconds later the shell blast. He said the buzzing noise was probably a drone monitoring the activity. Afterwards I saw that the Indiantown Gap Military Reservation is just south of Second Mountain, and that’s likely what we were hearing.","PA 325

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564736,"Really nice day for a hike today, with a chilly start—good for climbing. There was a tough early climb from the Swetara Gap area and Iron Bridge, then a long relatively level path with rocks. There were a couple of lookouts about halfway along the section, just before reaching the 501 shelter. Actually the topic of the day was rocks. I’ve included a couple of pics of small rocks in the trail and some bigger ones later on. We’re beginning to remember the paths through the boulder fields. That makes it a little easier when you don’t have to search hard for the blazes. 
I almost made a couple of wrong turns today. One at 1196.8 where the trail runs into a shallow ditch. I hiked straight across the ditch and a couple of steps later I looked up and saw a massive boulderfield (that I didn’t remember). The trail actually turned right and headed down the ditch. Later at 1199.2 I was mesmerized by a long-range view straight ahead of me and stopped to take a photo. I knew the trail turned, but thought it went right down a set of rock steps. Wrong - that was the Shower Step trail, the AT turned left.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564916,"The weather was our friend again today, cool in the morning and high 70’s in the afternoon. We checked our access roads out yesterday, only short distances on gravel and decent parking. I’ve gone over to describing the hike from a NoBo perspective even though I sometimes go the other way, and occasionally we hike SoBo together. 
While the first portion of this hike from 183 into Port Clinton lacks notable features, a significant portion of it has been burned. A sign indicates that a prescribed burn was done on May 4, 2017. The burn area extends for a couple of miles. There is a shelter about 0.3 mi off trail, but neither of us visited it. The trail is mostly level with a good share of rocks and some boulders until it begins a steep drop into Port Clinton. To me the drop seemed about as steep as possible without using log or stone dams (mostly for erosion control). There were some stone steps with strategic rocks and roots, but it was mostly a gravel surface and the soil was still damp enough that the gravel didn’t slide. I was glad it’s not any drier on the trail or the gravel will start to slide. The very last few feet were down a set of stone steps that gave me pause.
After crossing the final stone steps, the NoBo hiker comes out on a train yard. There are a lot of tracks and often some activity, but no trains were moving. After crossing the tracks there are some historical descriptions and posters, and some large boulders of coal. There is also a train station, but the AT turns the other way and I’ve never visited the station. We’ve stayed at the Union House B&B in Port Clinton in the past, but it’s only open on weekends and it looked deserted today. The AT crosses the Schuylkill River and eventually crosses under PA 61 and heads uphill. The uphill takes a while and has some interesting rocky sections. Then the trail passes over a couple of hills before descending to Reservoir Road, our end point. We used the parking lot that’s a quarter mile down from the AT. The parking lot was full in the early afternoon and there was a lot of activity for a weekday. I’m not sure why so many folks were visiting the reservoir. 
I’ve included a few photos of some sights along the trail, flowers, a waterfall, and poison ivy climbing a tree. There is a lot of poison ivy along the edges of the trail and it’s hard to avoid. Most AT states have their share, but we always seem to notice it here in PA. In some places you’d think it was a harvest crop. Both of us are sensitive to it. Besides avoiding contact as much as possible, we wash our poles every evening using Dial detergent—we’ve heard that helps remove the culprit oils. I had a lot of trouble with it last year, but so far so good this year.
Tonight we’re in the Microtel in Hamburg. It's pleasant enough but in the middle of a sprawling shopping development that’s not very walkable. There is a large Cabella’s closeby that can provide hiking supplies and equipment. Hamburg is down the road from Port Clinton and a couple of miles from the AT, but hikers seem to find a way down if they want. In the past Cabella’s has offered a shuttle for hikers, but I don’t know any of the particulars.","PA 183

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565067,"A few days ago it was dipping into the 30’s early in the AM, and today it hit 90 here for several hours. The weather is a pretty big factor to us. It dictates what we wear and what clothing we carry for backup. It also dictates how much water we’re likely to need. And now that it’s getting consistently warmer, we need to prepare for bugs and watch out for snakes. I don’t know anything that I can do to deter snakes, but there are things a hiker can do to try to deal with ticks. Before we started this spring, I sent several sets of hiking clothes off to be treated with permethrin, and I have sprayed my slack pack and gaitors with permethrin solution. FYI, Columbia (brand name) manufactures a line of clothing that is identified as InsectShield, and Cabela also has some hiking gear that is treated with InsectShield. It’s my understanding that this is a pretreatment with permethrin that is effective for 70 launderings. The clothes that I sent off for pretreatment came back with the InsectShield label attached, indicating that permethrin is the active agent. Also, when we stopped by at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ in Harpers Ferry, WV a few weeks ago, we each picked up a bandana that has been treated with InsectShield. Anyway, it’s a helpful hint for hikers as the temps go up and the bugs manifest themselves. Today, both Princess and I finished our hikes with a cloud of gnats and an occasional fly buzzing around our heads. When the time comes, we both have headnets that slip over our hiking hats that have been pretreated with permethrin. 
Since I’ve had Lyme twice, I’m particularly sensitive about ticks. Just to make the point, I’ve attached a photo of a tick that I found on my leg after a hike last November. It was a pretty large tick, much larger than the nymph deer ticks that seem be to proliferate on the AT. We used tweezers to remove it and the head parts came out. I still took several doxycycline tablets as a prophylactic against Lyme. Over the years, Princess has found several of the small ticks on her, but she was able to pull them off easily, took some doxycycline and never had any ill effects. 
On to different topics. NoBo-wise, early in today’s hike was a tough climb to Pulpit Rock. This starts as a long, hard climb and the finish is over boulders. But the view from the “rock” is magnificent. I’ve included several shots, one looking down at the forest below and another of the long range view. It’s really incredible, well worth the effort of getting there. A couple of miles further is the Pinnacle, also a great view, but we’ve never taken the side trail there. Then there are a lot of nasty rocks interspersed with some long road walks. After crossing Hawk Mountain Rd. (didn’t stop there either), the trail begins another climb up Hawk Mountain to Dan's Pulpit. [I’ve never learned the history about all these pulpits.] And Dan’s Pulpit has a pretty awesome view too. Then some serious rocks and boulders take over for a while, most of the way to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. This is a nice clean shelter close enough to the trail that we got a photo. Then there’s a seemingly endless forest road walk with gently ups and downs that gets really monotonous. Interesting dilemma: we get tired of the rocks, then when we get an easy walk it becomes monotonous. 
We thought we had arrangements to stay at the Blue Mountain Summit B&B, but apparently signals got crossed with Kenny, who runs it. The restaurant is only open Thursdays through the weekend, so we knew he wouldn’t be there. But we couldn’t locate the key to get into our room, so we finally gave up and headed down to Danielsville to stay at the Filbert B&B with Kathy & Sherry. They’re continuing to improve the Filbert and it’s always a treat for us to stay here. So we had dinner at Joey B’s in Palmerton and after our hike tomorrow we’re heading to the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap to take in the jazz shows this weekend. When you’re slacking, the AT life can be pretty good. (But the rocks still hurt your feet.)","Reservoir Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565318,"NoBo-wise, the toughest climb today was up and out of Little Gap. Sometimes boulders can be easy for me and sometimes they can be very challenging. The good news is that there are some rock steps that make the climb easier, but they don’t do the whole job. We have plenty of photos of rocks in the trail, but they really don’t convey the dilemma of trying to figure out how to chart a path through a boulder field. Most of the time your intuition tells you which way the path goes (or at least the path that most hikers have taken, boot-worn boulders, pole-scratches on rocks, or trampled-down leaves). But there are times when the path just doesn’t seem to be there and you have to take your best guess.
Anyway, today’s hike had lots of rocks—pretty much all the way. There were a few views and trails off to the side and power lines, but mostly it seemed like marching along on top of rocks. After the initial climb, the next biggest event was the descent into Wind Gap. I remembered this from last year. Only last year I did this section SoBo. So I climbed out of Wind Gap, and I missed a turn and managed to get off trail near the comm tower above Wind Gap. This year I found the point where I missed the turn (I must have been half asleep because it is clearly marked) and I had no trouble coming down. It's a little tricky since you come out on a major road and you have to hike through a narrow underpass then cross a busy road. At least I remember that part.
We stayed at the Filbert B&B in Danielsville, PA last night and another hiker who also stayed there (Travis) said his feet just plain hurt from all the rocks. The Filbert is pretty close to all the AT trailheads along this section: Lehigh Furnace Gap, Lehigh Gap, Little Gap, Smith Gap, and Wind Gap. And Kathy at the Filbert can shuttle to all these places. 
Today was the hottest day by far, reports said it hit 94 deg. in the afternoon. Suggestion to hikers: start as early as possible when it’s cool so you can finish before the heat of the afternoon. I drank more of my pack water today than I have so far this year.","Little Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565513,"After a beastly hot day yesterday, we hoped for cooler temps today. Our only downside this AM was that we paid a visit to the ShawneeCraft Brewery yesterday and sampled their wares (that wasn’t the downside). Then we stayed out too late last night at the Deer Head listening to the Jazz Jam downstairs. A little too much wine & beer made it difficult to rise & shine. But we did.
The climb up and out of Wind Gap will definitely wake you up. When we did this with Pintsize several years ago it seemed pretty long. Mercifully it seemed shorter today. And the trail is in much better shape now that it was before. The side growth has been cut back and the poison ivy doesn’t seem as prolific as it did then. Maybe because it’s a little earlier in the season? 
What I didn’t remember is how long a trudge this section is. Miles and miles of very rocky trail. I kept thinking it would get better (fewer rocks) but now I remember that it doesn’t. I think my Salomon boots with thick soles really help a lot compared to the trail runners that Princess uses. But nothing completely cushions your feet from those rocks. 
The first part of the trail is pretty level, little dips but nothing difficult. About 5 miles in a sign alerts hikers to the upcoming Wolf Rocks  and offers a blue-blaze side trail that bypasses the rocks. Pintsize talked us into taking on Wolf Rocks the first time and we’ve done them every year since then. IMHO they’re not as tough as Bake Oven or Knife Edge. Just an extended ridge walk. I think the hardest part is the start downhill at the end, but it’s not long. Then there’s a long road walk to Fox Gap. 
After that there’s some more up and down and a short climb to a ridge, then a long forest road walk to Mt. Minsi. Minsi is a disappointment to me, I hoped for a more impressive hilltop. But I haven’t found a good view. There are some old foundations and sheds, then a downhill slope into Delaware Water Gap. The downhill is the most impressive part of this section. There are some really good views of the valley, the Delaware River, and surrounding mountains. And the downhill passes through some interesting terrain, especially at the lower end. 
So tonight we’re back at the Deer Head Inn and we enjoyed some more great music here tonight. Laila Biali with Ike Sturm was a great surprise to us and we had a terrific time at the club. We always meet some interesting people here. We plan to hike 2 sections north of here tomorrow and Sunday so we can stay at the Deer Head for 2 more days.

We met him at the Filbert B&B in Danielsville, PA and suggested that he stay at the Deer Head Inn on the way through Delaware Water Gap. He followed through, met us at the Jazz Club last night and hiked with us today. We’ll do another section together tomorrow before moving on. We have 2 sections to finish in PA and he has 1. 
Today we shared a shuttle out to Millbrook-Blairstown Rd., I followed the shuttle in our car and parked it at the trailhead. Then we all piled in with the shuttle driver, Kenny and drove out to Culver Gap. Our hike today was from Culver Gap SoBo to Millbrook-Blairstown Rd (where our car was waiting). We started early, but it was a long shuttle ride so we didn’t actually start hiking until around 7:00. The weather forecast led us to believe that there was little chance of rain, but they were wrong. Not long after we started, sprinkles showed up and there was a little light rain off and on for a while. But not enough for rain gear, so it wasn’t a problem.
After an initial climb to the ridge, the rest of the hike was smaller ups and downs along the ridge. There were some rocks, but not the consistent rocky path we found in PA. Several times we climbed out of the woods for a good view of the valley, although most of the time we were in woods. The trail was pretty nice, we had several small rock climbs and crossed several hilltops with large slabs of rock. There were also several sections of woods road hike, old roadbeds that were never paved and are mostly covered with grass. We were able to keep our pace up with those sections. We also hiked around a beaver pond with a beaver den/hut/?? in the middle. (Didn’t see any beavers).
We made quick work of the hike and then stopped at a new brewery on the way back called Buck Hill. They seem to have been a pub/restaurant for a while, but they are scheduled to introduce their own beers within days. We did sample a collaboration beer they did with another brewer in the area. We had lunch back near Delaware Water Gap at the restaurant in the Shawnee Resort facility. They feature the ShawneeCraft beers that we tried out two days ago. This evening we ate at the Deer Head jazz club again.Travis joined us and we’ll hike with him again tomorrow. We hope to get back to the Inn in time for the Sunday brunch.","Millbrook-Blairstown Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565515,"Today we started about a half-hour later and still made it to the trailhead just after 6:30 (it was closer). We moved out smartly with Travis and the weather was fantastic, just about ideal. Cool temps most of the time, occasional light breezes on the high points, mostly clear skies with little humidity. The bugs never really came after us. Since Kenny shuttle all of us to the trailhead, I’ll depart from the usual direction and describe the SoBo hike. All 3 of us hiked SoBo back to Delaware Water Gap
Initially we had a woods road walk for a while (to clear our heads after a late night), then a moderate climb up to the ridge. Not too many memorable spots along the ridge-a comm tower that features a picnic bench. There were several tents around the base. Then more ridge walk for 3 miles or so over several overlooks where the woods thinned and there was a good view of the valleys. Our first major milestone was the Mohican Outdoor Center. In true form we shunned the 0.3 side trail and pressed on back up the hill to the ridge. 
The ridge showed a succession of high points with vistas. These generally had long smooth rocks that made for easy hiking. But there were a lot of rocks along the way. We took a few pic of the valley views on both sides of the ridge. Kittatinny Mt. summit was somewhere along there, not sure where. Then we finally headed down.
Eventually we reached Sunfish Pond. This is always a noteworthy feature on the trail. The trail along the rocks beside the pond seems to change a little every year. If anything, it’s a little easier to navigate than in the past. Although we did have some difficulty in identifying the actual AT at one point. Besides the impressive views across the pond, there is also a point where hikers have erected innumerable cairns at the water’s edge. I took several photos.
After that we thought we had it made, the trail turns away from the pond on a grassy forest road and we started booking it. Too soon, then it turned to the left into the woods and we had lots of rocks to walk over. Several time we thought we would get an easy walk, but each time it switched to rocks. Really tough stuff for a while. 
Finally we got the long downhill trail. Still some rocks and rock erosion dams, but it made for faster pace. But once we passed Sunfish Pond, there was a horde of hikers/walker (in addition to the usual AT crowd) who were out for a Sunday AM excursion. Boatloads of people, all ages, etc. It was hard squeezing your way through a passel of scouts. But of course we made it. The woods trail ended at a massive parking lot that was absolutely packed. Cars were parked everywhere. The last leg of the section was a long roadwork along the interstate, then on a bridge across the Delaware River. We stopped on the bridge for obligatory photos at the PA/NJ state line that was painted onto the pedestrian walk alongside the freeway. 
The Deer Head Inn was only a couple of blocks up from the end of the bridge. Out goal was to get back in time for brunch at the Deer Head and we did. Brunch was great with mimosas, eggs Benedict, etc. Ice cream in the PM, and later dinner an jazz at the Inn. I’m sold on this slack packing strategy. 
Our penalty for skipping ahead to enjoy the Deer Head over the weekend is that we have to go back tomorrow (and the next day) to finish up a couple of sections that we skipped.","Millbrook-Blairstown Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565592,"We’ve reached the end of our stay at the Deer Head Inn for this year. We had a great 4 days here. Regardless of future hiking plans, we resolved to try to arrange a weekend excursion to the Deer Head for some of our Norfolk friends. So we were ready to hit the road early this morning and we expected to be packing the car in the rain (forecast to begin overnight). But when the morning light finally showed up, the streets were dry. The forecast had been revised and the rain was now predicted for mid-morning.
We had a long drive back into PA to hike 2 sections that we passed over earlier (so that we could spend the weekend at the Deer Head). Today’s target was the challenging section from PA 309 to LeHigh River Gap. This includes several notoriously nasty features including the Knife Edge, Bear Rocks and Bake Oven Knob. The NoBo version of the hike starts innocently enough with a long woods road walk from PA 309. Then the trail takes a turn and heads up into the Knife Edge. This is a narrow ridge of very slanted rocks with a long drop on one side. We’ve seen young fearless hikers sprinting across the slanted rocks at the top. But there is a less daunting approach that involves creeping along a ledge that is just to one side of the top. It takes longer, but it’s recommended for the less adventurous. The ridge walk ends with a short, but sharp descent down the slanted side of the ridge. This year we found another path that was less formidable and ended in the same place. Of course, the rocks don’t end there. Shortly after is Bear Rocks, another challenging set of rocks. It becomes hard to tell one set of rocks from another. 
About 2 miles beyond Bear Rocks is Bake Oven Knob (another name for another massive pile of rocks). For me this feature has always been distinctive because of the graffiti and trash it holds. It’s quite accessible by car and we usually encounter other hikers there. It has a huge parking lot about a quarter mile away and a well worn access path, I guess it's a favorite excursion for local folks. It is a sort of scramble, I think there are a number of paths through the knob, but there are blazes if you take the time to scan for them. Since this is the 4th time for us, and we’ve gone both directions (NoBo & SoBo) we have a general idea of the path—that makes it a little easier. But the boulders are big and the knob is on a peak that drops off sharply so it’s definitely challenging and we take it very slowly. I think the trail club in the area has been working hard and I saw no graffiti and very little trash this time. They get high marks for that, the cleanup had to be hard.
Beyond the knob are several more boulder fields, unnamed as far as I know, but still tough. And also a shelter just a few feet off the trail. Today it had 2 lightweight folding chairs and looked very accommodating. No long past the shelter was a final boulder hurdle. At first I thought it was a power line crossing, but I was too focused on the boulders and I don’t remember seeing any lines. The AT takes a zig-zag path across the field and then slants down and back into the woods. In my opinion this has always been a tough obstacle and it’s just before Ashfield Road. Almost every year we’ve found trail magic at this road and one year we met the trail angel that supplies it. Usually it’s gallon jugs of water and in the summer months water can be very scarce through this section of PA. Today though it was cool and starting to drizzle so water wasn’t an issue.
The last stretch was mostly a nice walk through the woods. The clouds were low and at times the mist drifted down into the trees. The trail passed through some open areas, some pine groves and the woods were green with knee-high ferns. I had trouble with my Z-Packs poncho earlier this year and Z-Packs was able to repair it and send it back, so I checked it out on the hike. It was misting with some very light drizzle, so it wasn’t a hard test,  but the poncho seems to be fine. There is a nice shelter on the downhill to the river, it looks comfortable for a few hikers. Then the trail comes out on the bridge across the Lehigh River. The north end of this section for us was the parking lot on the other side of the river. Shortly after finishing the rain really picked up. We're headed to the Filbert B&B for the evening.","PA 309 (Blue Mountain Summit)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565786,"The only section of the trail we had left unfinished in PA is just shy of 5 miles from Lehigh Gap up the hill and across the superfund site to Little Gap. Some would say that’s essentially a zero and I would agree, except that the climb up and out of Lehigh Gap is not trivial. It’s about 1,000 ft of rock to scramble over. 
We were ready for the climb after a good night’s rest at the Filbert B&B in Danielsville. Kathy took good care of us as usual and we had a good dinner last night in Palmerton at the One Ten Tavern. Restaurant options are not bountiful on Monday evening and we were lucky to find something open. Plus they had a reasonable beer selection. And this morning Kathy cooked a sturdy bacon, eggs, potatoes, juice, fruit & toast breakfast with coffee to help us get going.
We followed Kathy to Little Gap where we left our car and then she drove us on to Lehigh Gap where we started our hike NoBo. I’ve described this climb 3 times already, so this is likely redundant. But it seemed different to me this time. Parts of the climb were certainly the same, however, there were sections that seemed new to me and I don’t remember the same feeling last year. Perhaps we just took a different path? Overall, the climb is not as formidable to me as it was the first time. The initial climb is still exactly the same, a long series of high rock and root steps that take you up quickly and tire you out along the way. Then come the real rocks. It really is just a rock pile, all sizes of rocks, and virtually nowhere can you see dirt around or under the rocks. Princess led the way as always, and for the most part we simply followed the blazes. There are only a few places where you have optional paths to the next blaze. 
I took a number of photos and Princess did too, including some videos. As we got higher, the views became more impressive and extended farther, and as we hiked around the mountain the view shifted to Palmerton and environs. Gradually the terrain transitions from all rock to some rock to a rock/gravel path. And the bushes and small trees closed in around us to obscure the view. Near the top we finally reach the beginning of the Zinc Pile Superfund Site that is closed off by a  fence. At this point the trail turns downhill a bit and then turns again to parallel the ridge. So as we walk along we get a great bird’s eye view of the length of Palmerton. Finally the trail turns up toward the ridge a bit and then turns easterly again, across a rocky sort of desolate area, then through woods and under powerllines, and finally back through woods until it descends to Little Gap (where our car was waiting). 
It was a short hike, so we were finished by mid-morning and headed back to the Filbert for a shower. Kathy talked us into driving to Bethlehem, PA for a visit and it turned out to be a good time. We had lunch at the Wooden Match, then headed into the historic district to check out the Moravia Bookshop and Fegley’s Bethlehem BrewWorks. Back at the Filbert, Kathy’s friend Sherri joined us for the evening and we had dinner at the Shack in Slatesville and stopped at the Blue Mountain Resort on the way back to the Filbert. It was a great evening and a good time was had by all. Kathy made a commitment that next year she and Sherry will hike with us from Fox Gap to Delaware Water Gap and we’ll partake of the jazz at the Deer Head. So now we have firm plans for next year.
Tonight is our last night at the Filbert and early tomorrow morning we head to Culver Gap. We’ve had a terrific time here, it’s hard to leave, but we’ll be back again I’m sure.","Lehigh River Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565897,"This was another moving day: from the Filbert B&B to High Point Mountain Motel. Kathy gave us another fine (early)  breakfast sendoff. We were pretty much ready to go and hopped in the car for the long drive north to our next AT section. While we were staying at the Deer Head Inn over the weekend, we hiked across the PA-NJ state line and hiked the first 2 sections in NJ (with Travis on Sat & Sun). So today we swapped between Culvers Gap and High Point HQ on NJ 23. There are several good access points along this section, so we split it up into 3 swaps. 
From the NoBo point-of-view, starting at Culvers Gap there is a mile and a half of climb to the fire tower at the top. For those who need a break, there is a picnic table near the base of the tower. Then a long trek through the woods and a shorter climb up Sunrise Mountain to The Pavilion at the top. The Pavilion is a large structure with a roof, open sides and benches around the edge of the interior. Another good resting place. There has been a good view in the past, but the surrounding vegetation is gradually obscuring the view. There is good road access here with a large parking lot so we used it as a swapping point. 
From the Pavilion, the trail heads downhill and there aren’t many distinctive features in this stretch, except for Mashipacong Shelter. When we first did this section in 2014 with Professor T, we had a pouring rain for much of the first part of the hike. The rain had abated when we reached this shelter and we took the opportunity to take off our boots. I literally poured a cup of water out of each boot. After that they were still wet, but they didn’t slosh and they were a lot lighter. Just beyond the shelter the trail crosses Deckertown Road. This crossing also has a decent parking lot for a good swapping point.
From this point on to the park HQ, I remembered very little of the trali, except for a couple of clearings with good views to the east and a short but very steep descent down the face of a very steep descent. Shortly after the descent, I met a group of about a half dozen hikers (older gentlemen, perhaps some my age) moving quite nicely through the rocks. Most of them were using single wooden hiking poles. They were the first hikers I saw this morning on the trail. As you get closer to the park HQ, the trail is more heavily travelled and it widens out and gets a lot smoother. 
The hiker parking lot is almost a quarter mile down the road from the HQ, but since Princess was waiting on me, she used the HQ Visitor Lot which was mostly empty. After I arrived we headed left on NJ 23 to the High Point Motel. After cleaning up we found a good local restaurant (Front Street. Cafe) in Fort Jervis and picked up some supplies on the way back to the motel.
The weather today started with sprinkles but turned out great. However, the forecast for tomorrow is deteriorating and now it looks like solid rain. Today’s high was 73, tomorrow is projected to be 53 with rain continuing.Yuck, tomorrow we hike through a swamp.","Culver Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566086,"Yesterday was not a good day for me. I managed to get a full-blown head cold & sore throat. We decided last night that I would not hike and today I supported Princess while she hiked NoBo. It was a miserable day, rain from start to finish and it’s still raining now. However, the good news is that the hike was relatively easy, albeit wet. The trail in this area has frequent road crossings so I was able to met her often during her hike. The Guthook app does a good job of identifying road crossings along the trail.
The starting point was the park HQ and about a mile in is the observation tower for the High Point tower. There’s a side trail to the actual tower at the top of the hill and we’ve never taken it. The remainder is a walk across a patchwork of farms and woods. In one pasture she surprised a group of goats that took off when they saw her. She was a little concerned since there were two young goats in the group, but they ran off. For a long stretch the trail runs alongside the state line between NJ and NY. Then it turns into the Wallkill Reserve and eventually comes out on Liberty Corner Road. There are several marshy areas along the way with boardwalks for AT hikers. Princess took a photo of a boardwalk through skunk cabbage plants. She thought that the boardwalk has been refreshed with new planks built on top of the previous walk. It was a good day for newts and she also took a pic of a red spotted newt. 
I stopped at the General Store in Unionville for coffee and saw several very wet hikers on the front porch. But Princess said she never saw anyone on the trail. Today was a good day to hunker down. They say the weather will improve tomorrow and we may actually see some sun.","High Point State Park HQ

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566250,"After a Mucinex day away from the trail, I took a chance on coming back. My cold was better but my throat was still sore. Today was the Pochuck and Wawayanda mountains section of the AT. The rain had mostly stopped when we woke, but it was overcast and and the trees were full of water. We started early and only saw a few hikers along the trail. Princess saw some hammocks still up so I guess folks were sleeping in hoping to miss the rain. There wasn’t much rain after daybreak, but the trail was pretty wet and the streams were full. The trail goes through some low areas with boardwalks in this section and wet boards can be very slick if there’s any angle on the board. Neither of us slipped on any boards today.
I got the NoBo straw today and I’ll describe it that way. From Liberty Corners the trail heads up Pochuck Mountain. It’s a 2-mile climb with rocks and a false summit, followed by 2 peaks that are another 300 ft up. The second peak is the actual Pochuck Mtn. peak. From there the trail descends eventually to Pochuck Creek. Pochuck is an unusual feature. It’s a large swamp with an elevated wooden footbridge that’s almost a mile long. The whole boardwalk is wide enough for people to pass easily and there are places where it’s built out with benches. In previous years I’ve seen birdwatchers along the walk, but not today. The walk crosses over a small island and later a very impressive suspension bridge that spans the actual Pochuck Creek. The bridge is elevated over the creek and has unusual horizontal structures along the walkway. Princess said that she had some sprinkles of rain when she crossed over the boardwalk.
After the swamp, there’s a wet woods walk, a plank walk, a train track, a fence stile and a long plank walk across a meadow thats been full of cows in the past. And across the road is Wawayanda Mountain and the so-called “stairway to heaven” climb to the top. I’ve done this piece both NoBo and SoBo and I definitely prefer NoBo (climbing). The climb is almost all rock and trail workers have engineered a lot of elegant rock steps that can make the climb much easier, but they’re harder for me to see when descending. Nonetheless, it’s a tough climb and it took me a while. Unlike many other mountain climbs, the top is very well defined and I’ve included a pic of the mailbox someone has left there. After the “stairway” the rest of the hike was anticlimactic, although the woods was really beautiful after the rain. The trail rolled up and down small hills and around a small lake. And all of the “downs” were wet and muddy. 
After the hike we relocated to “Anton’s on the Lake” in Greenwood, NY. We were lucky to get in, it’s hard to find lodging on Memorial Day weekend.","Liberty Corners Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566498,"Today’s hike was really tough. AWOL’s guide says “despite the unimposing profile, rocks, abrupt ups & downs make this section challenging”. That’s a concise and accurate statement. This took us a lot longer than expected and I’m beat. There were definitely interesting features and a variety of terrains. Rock climbing, ravines, ridges, streams, waterfalls, and plenty of ups and downs. Notable sights were the NJ-NY state border, Prospect Rock (highest point in NY on AT) with the American flag flying and a view of Manhattan skyline, and Cat Rocks. I remember that the descent down to E. Mombasha is hard. But I suspect the most memorable event for me will be my experience with a couple of copperheads. 
I was hiking NoBo and concerned that I was moving too slowly, so I tried to move along faster. I had passed Prospect Rock and several similar rock outcroppings and I thought I was starting a descent. Then another outcropping showed up and I clambered up that. The rocks on the top were similar to previous outcrops and I was moving quickly when I noticed a piece of notepaper held down by a small rock. I almost hustled past, but decided to read it. “2 huge copperheads by next blaze, GATOR”. I looked up to the blaze on the rock ahead of me and didn’t see anything, but then I saw the 2 snakes just to the left of the blaze. One was stretched out and sunning and the other was coiled up looking my way. I’ve never seen a copperhead before, but they looked like what I heard described. I looked for a way around the reptiles, took a quick photo, found a ledge just to the right and snuck around. When I looked back at the snakes, they hadn’t moved. I met 5 other hikers headed up SoBo and warned them, most had already heard it from GATOR. And I decided not to hurry over the rocks.
I’ve included a photo I took after I passed the snakes. I’ve compared it with a number of copperhead photos on the web and I haven’t found a copperhead pattern that exactly matches what I saw. But the head shape looks pretty distinctive. Anyway, GATOR saved my skin and probably others. 
Princess had no problems with snakes today. She was a lot faster than I was. My cold is not improving and I’m having second thoughts about hiking tomorrow.","Long House Dr.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566824,"I decided not to hike today. The weather wasn't bad, but my cold was, so I sat out. Actually, I did drive Princess to the trail and picked her up at the other end. But I can’t say much about the trail since I didn’t do it. I do remember parts of this section and Princess took a number of photos. 
She started today in the Sterling Forest, but when she started down Arden Valley Road and crossed over I-87 (NY Thruway) she moved into the Harriman State Park. We’ve really come to appreciate this park this year. It’s an incredible asset. We have the impression that it’s a very old forest that has been well maintained with lots of recreational opportunities. It’s a huge park with lots of lakes and a network of trails that weave through the whole thing. It also seems to be well-used by hikers, boaters, runners, campers, picnicers, etc. We were here on a Memorial Day Weekend and the park was very busy, but it didn’t seem overrun. The scenery is fantastic. In most places the forest is relatively open without a lot of underbrush. Lots of huge rocks and boulders bring a sense of drama. We really like it.
As far as her hike today, the most memorable feature is the Lemon Squeezer. This is a massive boulder that blocks the trail as it passes down into a ravine, except that there is a crack in the boulder that’s just wide enough for a hiker to pass through. This is her 4th time through and she’s small, so it’s not problem for her. When I did it before, I really didn’t have a problem either—even when I had a backpack. But some really large hikers with really large packs may have to take their packs off and pull them through. My problem has been the “jump-up” that’s just beyond the squeezer. There’s a ledge that’s about 6 feet high and I have trouble scaling it. Fortunately there’s a short path around that part. Maybe I could have done it this year?
Another feature I’ve always liked is Fingerboard Mountain. Apparently the name comes from the rock formations across the top of the mountain. The trail crosses a number of long, smooth rock faces. When I hiked this section last year, it was wet and I slipped on one of the “fingerboard” rock and really banged up my elbow. It hurt for days. But today was nice and dry and she made it through the hike without any problems. We had good phone connectivity through the park and I was able to track her progress with the “Find My Phone” app. I hung out in the parking lot at Tiorati Circle until she got within 10 minutes of the Arden Valley Rd. crossing near the circle, and then I drove up to the trailhead and picked her up.","East Mombasha Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566923,"For the second day in a row, I didn’t hike today. Considering the weather, the decision wasn’t too hard. It was very chilly and very wet. The rain today has been predicted for several days and it continued most of the day, hard at some times. Princess did hike, she says she doesn’t care if it rains or not, although it does slow her down (slippery rocks, roots & mud). She did decide to shorten her hike. 
I dropped her off at Arden Valley and drove over to an off-trail parking lot on Seven Lakes Drive. We scouted the parking area out yesterday and it was packed with cars—no spaces available. But when I got there early this morning the miserable weather had taken it’s toll. There were only 3 cars in the lot (with room for over a dozen). There was a flow of hikers and runners into and out of the parking lot, but never more than 4 cars besides mine. 
Her hike today was shorter than usual, but it included climbing Black Mountain and West Mountain. I think both are about 600 ft. climbs so they weren’t easy especially in the rain. Supposedly they offer views, but not today. When we hiked West Mountain 2 years ago we saw a rattlesnake. I think it was too cold for any active snakes today. 
We checked out of Anton’s on the Lake in Greenwood, NY this morning and after her hike we checked out tomorrow’s trailheads, and decided to grab a sandwich for lunch at the Appalachian Mountain Deli across the river in NY. After we got our sandwiches we asked a hiker if we could join him at his table. And a few minutes later we learned that he is GATOR, the hiker who left the note 2 days ago that warned me that there were 2 copperheads just in front of me. I thanked him profusely for the note and we offered to take him to the nearest market for resupply (resupply is a little skimpy at the Deli). We found a market on Yelp, I’m not sure just where, but it worked out great and he was able to stock up for several days. Resupply opportunities are not plentiful for the next few sections. We had a great conversation and I was happy that I was able to thank him for taking the time to leave the note. He also alerted several other hikers who were coming the opposite direction. Without his warning, the outcome could have been very bad. 
After seeing GATOR on his way, we then headed down to Mahwah, NJ to visit Adam DeWolf’s mom. Adam is the hiker who saved us last year when we got caught in bad weather on Mt. Lafayette. Adam is currently in Seattle checking out potential positions, but suggested that we give his mom a call, and Linda and Michael invited us for dinner and to stay overnight before we move on. (Which is very generous considering that I am recovering from a cold.) We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening with them, had a terrific dinner that Linda prepared, and had a chance to shower and have our laundry done. They have a beautiful home and gave us a tour of all the landscaping improvements that Adam has put in. They are great hosts and we really appreciate their hospitality. Plus we now know a great deal more about Adam.","Arden Valley Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566933,"We had a great time with Linda and Michael last evening and they graciously put us up for the night. Linda is Adam DeWolfe’s mom and Adam is the hiker who kept us alive on Mt. Lafayette last year. It’s remarkable how you end up meeting some of the nicest people as a result of the AT. We have a lot in common—hiking, biking and political viewpoints. They got up really early to make a great breakfast for us and we took a few record photos afterwards. We hope to connect with them again, perhaps in Washington, DC as well as Norfolk, VA.
After 2 days of rest and recuperation, I was back on the trail today. The weather weenies suggested that the rains were over yesterday and that things would improve today. That was not the case. It was still in the low 50’s at the start with some drizzle and mist/fog at higher levels. I did NoBo today, starting where Princess stopped hiking yesterday (Seven Lakes Dr.). 
For me, the trail headed up Bear Mountain immediately. There is a tower at the top, and an Inn a short distance down. The mountain gets a great deal of public use and it’s criss-crossed with trails. A lot of time and energy has been invested in developing the AT as it crosses the mountain. I counted 444 stone steps on my climb, and over 700 stone steps on the way down. Most of these are carefully shaped steps, prepared and set by stone workers. There were plenty more naturally placed rocks that serve as steps, I didn’t try to count all of those. It’s really impressive and it makes for an easy ascent and descent, compared to most other AT mountains we cross. The only disappointment today was that there was almost no view. When I got to the top, the tower was barely visible in the mist. As I descended toward the Hudson, there were a couple of view points that were a little better.
The descent was easy with all the steps and there is a great public park at the edge of Hessian Lake at the bottom of the mountain. The trail winds through the park and then crosses under a road into a Trailside Zoo. I got to the zoo just a few moments after it opened for the day and was about the only patron there at that point. I took a few minutes to read a few of the placards and check out the bobcat and the bears, then I moved on out and across the Bear Mountain Suspension Bridge over the Hudson River. The bridge is pretty awesome. When we passed across it yesterday in our car, there was a giant American flag hanging from the cable tower high above the roadway for Memorial Day. It wasn’t there today. 
After crossing the bridge, the AT heads up the mountain very quickly and it’s a pretty long, arduous climb. A lot of well-placed rocks, but no stone worker steps. Eventually the trail pops out onto the remnants of a woods road and turns left. I’ve never taken the right turn here, but that leads to Anthony’s Nose which I believe is a feature that looks out over the Hudson River with a great view. There were a number of day hikers who were coming down as I climbed and I’m sure they had climbed to the nose.
From this point, the AT has a lot of abrupt ups and downs, but not too many distinctive features. The Greymoor Center is located a short distance off trail, neither of us went there. And there are a number of other trails that cross the AT. The endpoint today was a grassy area adjacent to Dennytown Road. There is a small brick building near the parking lot with potable water where hikers usually replenish. Several years ago this was where we first met Spartacus and we eventually ended up hiking and summiting Katahdin with him. This was the first time we have been here when it’s so chilly. After a couple of days off, I was really spent by the end of the hike.After the exercise we headed toward Cold Spring, a small town that is west of the AT. We had a reservation at the Pig Hill Inn. We stayed here last year and really enjoyed the town. But we wanted to do our laundry first and according to Yelp, the nearest laundromat was in Beacon, NY (north of Cold Spring). So we ended up in Beacon and while the laundry was in progress we found a place called Draught Industries that is fantastic if you like beer. They have a huge selection of local and not-so-local beers on tap and apparently they rotate them frequently (when the kegs blow I guess). I got a flight of some of their IPAs. The bartender's name is Greg, so we had a lot in common from the outset. And I had a turkey sandwich that was awesome. The place is in the middle of a sort of arts district that was pretty cool too. So later we got back to Cold Spring and spent the evening there. We still like Cold Spring, but if we come back next year I think we'll look for a place in Beacon.","Seven Lakes Drive

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566964,"We were up and out of the Pig Hill Inn early this AM. Way too early for breakfast, but they provided us with some good eats to get going.  The route to our starting point was straightforward and we were there by 7:00. It’s only about three miles from there to the end of Canopus Lake & Fahnestock State Park and it’s mostly little ups and downs. It sounds easy, but it’s like going up and down flights of stairs. After a while your legs start to protest. As you get near the lake, there is a lot of neat stonework on one side of the trail. The trail is pretty level as a result of the stonework, I heard somewhere that this is an old rail bed built for mining purposes. Eventually the trail pops out onto NY 301 and crosses over to follow the lake on the northwest side. The trail climbs up to nearly the top of the ridge and follows the lakeshore with some ups and downs along the ridge. There is a side trail near the north end that heads down to the lake and the beach. We camped in the park one year, but it was a long way to the campground for us. I don’t know if they provide anything closer or not. There is a nice overlook at the north end with a good view of the length of the lake. 
From there the AT continues north across Shenandoah Mountain, leading to a painted 911 Memorial Flag on the rock. There is a good view from here on a clear day, but today was not so clear. Then the trail drops down to Hortontown Rd and the RPH (Ralph’s Peak Hiker Cabin) shelter. The shelter is nestled close to several nearby private homes and the signs suggest that the local residents want to stay private. Before last year there used to be good parking spots on the road just north of the shelter. But last year the locals brought in some massive boulders to dissuade anyone from parking anywhere close the to shelter. I’m sure there’s a story with that but I don’t know it.
Regardless, the RPH shelter is very nice. It’s a 3-wall cinder block shelter with a roof extending out from the open end that covers a seating area. And there’s a pump next to the shelter. The AT passes along plank walks near the shelter and there’s a plank walk to the privy. I stopped for just a moment and found one hiker—GATOR, who was packing up his gear. We exchanged greetings and he said he’s doing fine so I pressed on. The next 3 miles was up, over and down a mountain, followed by a 2 mile repeat, ending for us at NY 52.
After connecting up with Princess we headed to Pawling, NY where we’re staying at the Pawling House B&B for 2 nights. We washed our clothes and our car and then checked in. It’s pricey, but extremely nice and we had a great dinner at McKinney & Doyle this evening. The downtown area appears to be only a couple of blocks, but I saw some neat storefronts and plan to check it out further tomorrow afternoon.That’s all from Pawling.","Dennytown Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567021,"Last night was not a good night to be in a tent (and I’m glad we weren’t). It started raining around sunset and several hours later a raging line of thunderstorms passed through the area. The lightning and thunder were incredible and it sounded like heavy rain. As we headed out shortly after daybreak this morning everything was wet, but the sky was mostly clear and the sun was burning off some residual fog. 
Our section today started at NY 52 where we finished yesterday. The parking lot is a short distance down the hill from the trail crossing and there is a blue blaze from the lot to the trail. Except for some wet spots, the trail was in great shape. The Morgan Stewart Shelter is about 4 miles in. We tented near the shelter in 2014 when we first walked the trail. Elusive was the only other hiker there. Mosquitos were abundant and Princess thinks that’s where I got the tick bite that gave me Lyme that year. I’m not sure why, but there seemed to be fewer bugs out today than past days.
After crossing the railroad tracks, the trail heads toward Nuclear Lake and tracks around the lake from the south to the north. Nuclear Lake apparently was named by United Nuclear Corporation when it set up a facility on the land in 1958 to conduct experiments for the government on uranium and plutonium. In 1972 there was an accident in a glove-box and an unknown amount of plutonium dust was dispersed in the building and the surrounding area. Contaminated soil was hauled away and the site was officially cleared by the government in 1975. I would not want to be anywhere near a single particle of plutonium which is deadly.
Today’s trail section also includes the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT. (The Keefer Oak is the largest oak in the south). The last section between the Oak tree and the LIRR tracks passed through a lot of swamp and wet ground. There are plank walks and the final section has a wide, elevated boardwalk.

We checked out of the Pawling House B&B well before breakfast and headed for the AT. We picked up where we left off yesterday with a key swap. 
After crossing NY 22 the trail heads into pastures for a bit and there is a classic photo op I can never resist of a wooden water tower in the midst of a herd of cattle. About a mile or so the trail heads into the woods and begins to climb to the ridge. Then after several miles of small ups and downs, it drops to the Wiley Shelter. Martin The Edge Hunley maintains this shelter and every year there seem to be more features. For example, there is a small bookshelf library that Martin has built—with “take a book, leave a book” on the front. We know Martin and Donna, they’re serious hikers and supporters of the AT.
Downhill from the shelter is the first state line crossing between NY and CT. The trail actually swings back and forth across the state border and finally passes into CT for the last time much further along the trail. Before that, there is a climb to the top of Ten Mile Hill and then back down to the Ten Mile River. The AT follows along the river for a short distance and then just beyond a shelter the trail crosses Ten Mile on the Ned Anderson Memorial Bridge. The bridge is actually right where the Ten Mile flows into the Housatonic River. And not far upstream (to the north) is Bulls Bridge, a picturesque covered bridge. The AT doesn’t really pass within sight of the bridge, but it’s very close and a short walk (relatively speaking).
There’s a short roadwalk before the AT turns up into the woods and heads up Schaghticoke Mountain. This is a steady climb that finally levels out, but views are limited. There is one good spot on a slab of rock that looks west. I guess this is a ridge and it continues for maybe 5 miles with hills along the way. Eventually the trail goes up Mt. Algo and then turns down past the Mt. Algo Shelter. 
Our end point to today was CT 341, that leads into the town of Kent, CT. In the past, we’ve stayed at several places in the Kent area (Fife and Drum, Cooper B&B). Since we have a car this time we’re heading straight to Bearded Woods to see Big Lu and Hudson and we plan to stay there for several days.","NY 22

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567762,"We had a great time returning to Bearded Woods and seeing Hudson and Big Lu again. Hudson joined us in CA to hike the John Muir Trail last year and we had a lot of memories to revisit from that trip. The JMT is really different from the AT and a tremendous hiking experience (if you can take the altitude and the dust, I sat out because of the altitude). Bearded Woods is a favorite place of ours. It’s not the traditional hostel, Hudson describes it as a “Bunk & Dine”. It’s immaculately clean with bunk rooms and other features more consistent with B&B’s. Hudson has hiked the AT twice and knows more about the entire AT than anyone else I know. He’s thru-hiked and LASHed and says he wants to do a SoBo thru next.
Back to our Saturday hike. Hudson & Big Lu can easily slack hikers on 3 or 4 day-sections around Salisbury. The Saturday weather forecast seemed perfect, no rain, moderate temp, so we decided to do the more difficult (for us) section across Bear Mountain. As usual, we decided to do it SoBo since Princess would rather climb a tough part rather than descend. So we left our car at the Over Mountain parking area and Hudson drove us up to Guilder Pond so that we could hike together.
This section crosses 3 peaks (Everett, Race and Bear Mtns.). Mt. Everett is the tallest of the 3, but not the largest climb since Guilder Pond is over 2,000 ft elevation. It was overcast and cool, but we did see a (non-threatening) snake poking it’s head out from under a rock. Just before we reached the top it started to drizzle and eventually rained for an hour or so—unexpected. The rain was light enough that we didn’t bother with ponchos, although we had to be more cautious climbing over wet rocks and that slowed us down. The clouds to the west looked really ominous from the top of Everett and the mist obscured any views. The descent from Everett is moderately steep.
Next was Mt. Race. The most interesting feature here is the ledges that are just south of the peak. The AT follows a ledge for nearly a half-mile and the drop-off is steep. Much of this part of the trail is across large flat rocks with good traction and the ledge does provide great views mostly to the east. At this point in our hike, the clouds were not as low and we had some good views. Then the trail turns abruptly into the woods and continues descending. The descent includes a section through a beautiful pine woods. 
The long descent finally ends at Sages Ravine. The state line crosses the AT here so we hiked SoBo back into CT. We both think the climb up along the ravine is one of the prettiest sections of the AT. The whole area is green with lots of moss and there are constant waterfalls as we climb along the stream. There has been plenty of rain, so the stream is flowing full. Eventually we turned away from the stream and began a steep climb up Mt. Bear. 
The climb up the north side of Bear Mountain starts out pretty steep and gets really steep near the top, definitely hands and feet required for me. I don’t think we’ve ever done this section NoBo, we would both rather climb up this part than descend. The summit is rewarding, there is a plaque denoting the highest ground in CT. The Guthook description indicates that it is the highest peak in CT, but not the highest point in CT since the state border passes across the flank of Mt. Frisell at a point that is 63 feet higher than Bear. There is a big stone cairn at the summit with a flat top that provides excellent views. Apparently Bear Mountain is a favorite day hike for local weekenders and there were so many hikers that there was no room at the top of the rocks.
Going SoBo from Bear, the rest of our hike was long and much less dramatic. A long, pleasant woods hike and we met a lot of day hikers headed up toward the top. The trail had dried out at this point and we made good time. After the hike we returned to a full house at Bearded Woods.","Guilder Pond

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567763,"We did this section out of order based on the weather forecasts. We jumped ahead on Friday to do the Bear Mountain section—but still encountered some rain, so much for weather forecasting. So today we headed back to hike one of the two sections that we skipped over. 
This took us back to Kent where we left off at CT 341. We did a swap that I’ll describe NoBo. The AT crosses 341 about a mile outside Kent. There is limited parking along the road and the trail crosses a stile and a pasture and then a stream heading NoBo. Then there’s a stiff climb, and some ups and downs leading to Caleb’s Peak. We always take a photo here since my nephew’s name is Caleb. Then comes the hardest part of this section, St. John’s Ledges. Here the trail descends about 600 ft. down a rocky face. It’s extremely slow going, foot placements are crucial, and it’s hard going down or up. The reward at the bottom of the cliff is a long, flat 5 mile walk along the Housatonic River. After descending the ledges it feels great, but SoBo walkers are anticipating the climb up the ledges. 
At the northern end of the river walk the trail heads up and then steeply down to Guinea Brook. This brook has been problematical for us as long as we’ve been doing the trail. The local mountain club has posted signs on both sides of the creek crossing that recommend using a bypass route. They say the creek crossing can be dangerous during high water periods and  the rock stepping stones are not safe. In the past we’ve done it both ways—rock hopped the creek and taken the bypass. This time we both decided ahead of time to take the bypass. It’s longer, but safer. After the creek, there’s are a couple more climbs. The trail joins the Pine Knob Loop trail for a time and also crosses Hatch Brook. The trail follows the brook for a while with good views of the water cascading down the rocks. There’s also an interesting stretch of boulder hopping just before reaching West Cornwall. Again we headed back to Bearded Woods.","CT 341

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567764,"This section is very familiar to us. Two years ago we met Spartacus at Bearded Woods just after doing this section. He jumped ahead to meet up with us and wanted to slack pack with us. He joined us all the rest of the way to Mt. Katahdin that year and we had a great time. Several months later in the fall after we finished, we traveled back up to CT and rejoined him while he hiked this section that he skipped earlier in the year. So we hiked along with him when he actually finished his 2015 AT thru-hike in CT. Big Lu from the Bearded Woods joined us as well and we all celebrated with Spartacus after the hike. 
Today was a pleasant day, the rains held off until we were finished. We left our car at Under Mountain Rd and Big Lu shuttled us to West Cornwall so we could hike NoBo together toward Salisbury. As usual, the trail starts off with a stiff climb. There is a passage at the top through a split rock reminiscent of the lemon squeezer. Most of the rest of the hike is a very nice woods walk. There is a break in the middle as the trail passes by Canaan and Falls Village. It winds through a nice park along the Housatonic River, past a power plant, and over an Iron Bridge before heading up Mount Prospect. Later it passes by a large rock known as the Giant’s Thumb before heading down toward Salisbury. The last descent is pretty steep and slows you down a bit. 
The trail doesn’t actually pass through downtown Salisbury. It skirts the town and heads through a nice wooded area before reaching the Under Mountain Rd. parking lot where we left our car. Afterwards we had another great dinner with Hudson and Big Lu. Based on the forecast of rain tomorrow we’ve decided to zero here at Bearded Woods. Time for a rest.","West Cornwall Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568041,"Not much hiking news today, we sat out the nasty weather at Bearded Woods. And it was a cold, rain-swept day. We could have hiked, we don’t melt in the rain, but we had actually planned ahead to take a zero and the weather helped us schedule when. So I slept in until about 11:00. And we spent the day relaxing and prepping for more hiking. 
Early in the evening we called Spartacus and his wife Janelle. As I noted a day or two ago, we drove back up to CT from VA to hike with Spartacus as he finished his 2015 Thru-hike. Earlier that year he skipped a section near here to link up with us, and we promised that we would return to hike along with him when he eventually came back to finish that section. We did, and Big Lu also joined us. We had a great celebration that evening. Spartacus is recovering from a problem earlier this year and it was great to hear from him, and we’re planning to meet him & Janelle when we reach Maine in a month or so.  
It’s always hard to leave Hudson and Big Lu at Bearded Woods, but we have managed to hook up with them at other times. Hudson is busy thinking up novel ways to do his third AT hike and some of them involve us. They have some time when the AT hiker season wraps up in the fall and that offers some possibilities. In the meantime we have almost 700 miles to cover.","

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568044,"After a zero day it’s a little hard to get back into the hiking mode. Especially after enjoying the hospitality of Big Lu and Hudson at the Bearded Woods. But all good things . . . So we loaded up the car early and set out for Guilder Pond. This is the same spot we started from last Saturday, except Saturday we headed SoBo together toward Mts. Everett, Race and Bear. That was a very challenging hike. Today, we had one more piece of that ridge to do, namely Jug End. The change in elevation between Guilder Pond and Jug End Rd. is about 1200 ft in about 4 miles, with about half of the change in the last half mile. 
We did a short key swap for the Jug End piece knowing that it would be the most difficult and dangerous. We’ve done this before and it’s hasn’t gotten any easier. There are some really sharp drops/climbs along this section and some of it was still wet. I guess I forget about this piece from year to year, maybe because I want to. The best news is that neither of us saw any snakes. I’ve heard that timber rattlers frequent this section, so I guess we were lucky in that respect. 
The middle piece of this section is benign by comparison, mostly flat but wet. A lot of board and plank walks, a few bridges and wet soggy ground. I met a local hiker, Kate from Egremont, out with her dog who described a rattlesnake skin (already shed) that she found on Jug End. And I took the requisite photo of the Shea’s Rebellion monument. 
The third piece is more of a challenge, with climbs up June Mtn. and then East Mtn. And also plenty of ups and downs after the climbs. The East Mtn. elevation is about the same as in the Jug End section, but the descent to MA 23 is more gradual. 
Afterwards we headed into Sheffield to stay at Jess Treat’s. We’ve always stayed here while doing this section and it was good to see Jess again. We stayed here for a number of days in 2014 while I was recovering from Lyme and I’ve become quite familiar with Sheffield and the neighboring Great Barrington.","Guilder Pond

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568048,"It seems that we’ve had more than our fair share of rain lately, but today was the second dry day in a row and we enjoyed it. And temperatures have been a bit below seasonal expectations which is good for hiking. Temps today were milder than yesterday and ranged from the 50s into the 70s. 
Princess took some good photos today as we passed several ponds along the route, including Benedict, Upper Goose and an unnamed pond on Swann Brook. The hills in this section are moderate, ranging up to about 2,000 ft. The terrain varies a great deal. I didn’t remember how many wet spots I encountered, I missed one rock and the mud went over the toe of my boot. A section in the middle near Tyringham was really wet with some long boardwalks and also some places that needed boardwalks. The north end of the section crosses over the Mass Turnpike and I got a photo of the pedestrian bridge after I crossed over. 
A notable event for today was that I saw my first porcupine. It wasn’t on the trail, it was alongside the road as we drove to the trail. It looked like a pretty nasty character, a little smaller than I expected—maybe it was young. I think I’d prefer to see it along the road rather than in the middle of the trail. In previous years I’ve seen signs warning dog owners to keep their pets leashed to avoid clashes with porcupines. I think the dogs usually end up losing.
Tonight is our last night at Jess Treat’s. Over several years we’ve explored many of the good restaurants in the vicinity of Great Barrington & Sheffield with her. Some have moved on to other venues and been replaced. But we’ve always enjoyed the conversation. Two years ago Jess and her mother joined us for dinner at Bascom Lodge on Mt. Greylock with Spartacus and his family and we had a terrific time. This year we were saddened to hear that her mom passed. Jess is rebounding well and moving on. 
We did have a problem today. Princess lost a credit card and another card today somewhere on the trail. She plans to hike the next section SoBo tomorrow and ask NoBo hikers if they found them or heard of it. Replacing cards while moving on the trail is a problem. We’ll see how that goes.","MA 23

Friday, June 9
We woke to sunny skies this morning, clouds formed late in the morning, but the sun returned later in the afternoon. Very moderate temps, so it was a good hiking day. If I had to summarize the day, I’d say it was a day of hiking through lots of muddy stretches with some plank and board walks, interspersed with a few nice dry stretches. That’s probably not fair since I tend to remember the nasty mud rather than the nice stretches in between. It was certainly good practice for Vermont (or Vermud as some hikers refer to it). I need to perfect my ability to identify the rocks (which make for good footsteps) from the mud surrounding them. Hiking poles make good probes for this.
Our biggest goal today was to determine if anyone found the credit card that Princess lost yesterday and try to recover it. She figured that if she did today’s section (the next section) SoBo she had a good chance. And she actually did. She asked everyone she met and well into the hike she scored: a young hiker named Maple Syrup spotted her cards yesterday and picked them up. (the feature photo today)  He made a real effort after his hike yesterday to locate Princess. Her name was on the card and he found her in Facebook and tried to contact her. But we didn’t have good net connection last night and we didn’t spot his message. But he was prepared, knew what she looked like and was happy to return her cards. What a relief!! It certainly speaks to the honesty and integrity of the AT hiker community. Thank you again Maple Syrup. We owe him a beer when we find him in town.
Otherwise, today was sort of a wildlife day. Lots of evidence of beavers, though I’ve never spotted one. And I saw probably a dozen frogs. That’s interesting since I’ve only seen maybe two or three in the previous 1500 miles. They were all sizes, from maybe 3/4 inch to adults perhaps the size of a tennis ball. I think they were frogs rather than toads, but they weren’t the leopard frogs that I’ve seen in the past. 
Finally, today is an anniversary for us. One year ago on this date we were caught in an ice storm on Mt. Lafayette, saved by Wolfman and eventually rescued by the NH Fish & Game team. I doubt that I’d be writing this if not for them. We thank all of them for their efforts, but certainly a special thanks to Adam (Wolfman) DeWolfe, who got us to cover and kept us going until help arrived.","MA 20

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568253,"Not too much to say about today. The southern end of the section was Gulf Road at the edge of Dalton, MA and Mt. Greylock was the northern end. We had a hard time finding an open road up to Greylock (our car GPS nav system failed us), but eventually did. I’ve heard that Dalton is famous as a government mint. In past years we stayed at the Shamrock Inn, but this time we decided to stay in Pittsfield, MA at Yankee Suites (min. 2-day stay), and that worked out really well. Great dining and drinking establishments were within walking distance.
Greylock is the highest mountain in Massachusetts. The trail up Greylock starts just outside Chesire and passes through some meadows before it heads uphill in earnest. Then it’s really uphill to the “nose” area. After that there are several miles along the ridge before the final climb up to the Greylock summit, lodge and War Memorial. The reverse, going down from Greylock along the same route is much easier and faster. The other end of the section, south of Chesire includes North Mountain. There are some good views to the west from The Cobbles (large outcroppings of marble rock), just south of Chesire.
We hoped to get up early enough to dodge the thunderstorms that were supposed to appear around noon. They never actually appeared, so we had no weather problems. Most of the trails were in the woods, so we didn’t have any dramatic photos. I did shoot several pics at a beaver pond that I passed. Later while I hiked I thought a lot about how the beavers decide to build the structures that they do. The pond that I passed had 3 dams. My analysis is that after they built the first, the pond they created started to fill in, so they built a second dam, then after pond filled in they built a 3rd dam. I’m curious how they decide when to start on the next dam. Is there a “project manager beaver” who says it’s time to start on the next dam?
Anyway, it was a nice day and a good hike.","Gulf Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568413,"I don’t mean to be complaining about the weather. That doesn’t help. But by way of reporting, today was a hot day. The temp was predicted to be 90, and our car thermometer agreed. That’s pretty warm for hiking. I need to include more water on my checklist. I usually carry 2 liters in my slack pack, but that’s not enough for me if I have a lot of climbing. The gnats and black flies are becoming more of an issue and today I pulled out my head net. It’s a fine mesh net (Sea-to-Summit) that fits over my hiking hat and it was pretreated with permethrin (InsectShield). It does a good job of protecting my head and neck, and all the rest of my clothes are also pretreated with InsectShield so I should be “covered”. But I have learned that the deer flies (aka black flies and maybe green-heads) will bore right on through clothing, apparently regardless of chemicals. If I hear a fly buzzing around my head I’m not too worried until I don’t hear it buzzing anymore—usually it’s landed somewhere and started to bite.
Today was a good conditioning hike for me. Yesterday Princess hiked NoBo up Greylock, so today I hiked SoBo up the other side of the mountain. The first part of the SoBo section from County Road down to MA 2 is long with moderate bumps, but not overtaxing. But the climb up the north side of Greylock really beat me up. I was struggling when I finally got to Mt. Williams. I recovered a little, but the last several hundred feet up Greylock was taxing. If I climb Greylock again, it’s going to be NoBo, not SoBo. We saw plenty of hikers on the trail today. Many were day-hikers taking advantage of the weekend. I did see one group of scouts descending Greylock. 
This morning we checked out of the Yankee Suites in Pittsfield, MA. The suite we had was great, everything we needed was there and we had plenty of space. This is an extended stay lodging facility, but the minimum number of days is 2 which fit our schedule. The facility is smack dab in the middle of downtown Pittsfield and we had great eating and drinking establishments all around us. We especially liked The District Kitchen & Bar for dinner, and Thistle and Mirth for brews.
This evening we’ve relocated to Bennington, VT (we crossed the MA/VT line) and we’re at the Four Chimneys B&B for 2 days. It’s about a mile from the downtown area. But we have our car so we drove into town and had dinner at Madison Brewing Company. We’ve been here before and we really like their beers.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568522,"The temp today really soared, to 92 in Bennington, VT. Fortunately it was somewhat cooler in the mountains and there was a reasonable breeze on the ridges. We’re packing some extra water bottles in our slack packs to be sure we stay hydrated. Today was a shorter day, mostly because access roads become very limited as we move further north. County Road is even dicey near the trailhead, a mostly one-lane gravel road that is poorly maintained with protruding rocks and large water holes. 
We didn’t take many pics today, the trail was mostly through woods. Beavers have been busy here and there were several ponds. I took several pond photos, one that includes a beaver hut (I’m never sure whether to call them beaver huts or dens or lodges). I’ve noticed that beavers appear to play a very active role in revising the landscape around here. 
I don’t think it’s rained here for several days, but large parts of the trail were very wet and muddy. My rock-hopping skills are improving and I didn’t submerge my boots today, but it takes a lot of time and concentration to navigate through these sections. The mud can be very deep and the boot prints in the mud demonstrate that a lot of hikers have been slogging through.
The most notable feature today was the north face of Harmon Hill that drops steeply down to VT 9. I tried to count the stone steps and got up to around 800. There has been an incredible amount of work done to make this climb or descent safe. But it’s still kinda creepy since it’s so steep. I didn’t take any photos going down, I needed my poles for balance.

We checked out of the Four Chimneys B&B and we’ll move on upstate after the hike today.
The first half of today’s hike was a long, long climb up Mt. Glastenbury. The reward was a fire tower just a little further uphill from the shelter. I don’t know anything about the history of the tower, but the sign at the base warned that only one person at a time should be on the tower. Glastenbury was the highest point of the day at 3750 ft., but there were plenty more hills left. It was pretty much a day of ups and downs. The trail is drying out a bit, of course there are still mud pits but it’s improving.  This section included a “beaver bog” and a number of views. Princess spotted some trilliums with unusual colors. Otherwise, thank goodness it’s over.
We checked into The Green Mountain House in Manchester Center and we plan to stay here several nights. Jeff keeps the house very, very clean and it’s about the same as visiting a friend’s home. It’s very comfortable and a very smooth operation. We had a delicious dinner at The Perfect Wife just a few miles from the hostel. It’s a favorite of ours and we keep coming back.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568747,"Today was the best day of the week for sure. Cool at the start (low 50’s) and climbing slowly through the 70’s. Not as humid as yesterday. So no complaints from me. We had one peak today, Stratton Mtn. It’s the highest peak in southern Vermont at just under 4,000 ft., but it’s only the 6th highest peak in all of Vermont. Killington is the 2nd highest and Pico Peak is the 5th highest in VT and the trail also crosses these mountains, but doesn’t cross the summit of either, so the max elevation for an AT hiker is higher on Stratton—unless the hiker chooses to take a blue blaze (side trail) to the other two peaks. Not us. All three of these peaks have ski facilities, but the Stratton ski slopes are not visible from the AT.
Anyway, the climb up Stratton is about three miles going either SoBo or NoBo. I did the NoBo so I climbed early in the morning when it was very cool. Stratton is high enough that the upper slopes are pine forests and I really love the smell of the pines and the softer pine needles on the trail. The trail is rocky in parts, but mostly a steady climb. When we climbed with Spartacus and Focus several years ago, we met the caretakers for the summit facilities at the top. They told us that Scott Jurek (an ultrarunner) had just passed through the summit 5 minutes before we reached it (they must have been confused on the time). Scott set the (supported) speed record for the AT that year. This year when I crossed the summit no one was there. In fact, besides Princess I didn’t see another AT hiker on the trail today. (Princess saw more) There is a tower at the summit, but I didn’t climb it. The remainder of the NoBo trail was a long descent that gradually turned into a long series of small ups and downs with no more mountains. 
Besides the summit, the only other “feature” was Stratton Pond near the base of the mountain on the northern side. The trail drops down to the water’s edge, follows the shore for a short distance, then turns abruptly uphill away from the pond. A sign indicates that the remainder of the AT along the shore has been flooded, ergo the uphill route. Virtually all of the trail today was in the woods, so not many views.","Kelly Strand Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569317,"While yesterday’s hike featured only Mt. Stratton, today we had a number of mountains to cross: Bromley, Styles, Peru and Baker. The first 3 are roughly the same elevation, while Baker is considerably lower. Bromley hosts ski slopes and the AT passes over the summit at the top of the ski lift and provides good views. 
We got another very early start from the Green Mountain House in Manchester and Princess dropped me at the southern end of today’s section and drove to the northern end. I was on the trail only a few minutes past 5 am. The sky was clear, so light was not a problem—we’re near the longest day of the year. It was also a little chilly, so the climb up Bromley warmed me up. And the light filtering through the forest as I climbed toward the east was really beautiful. I was at the top by about 6:40 and I took a few minutes to enjoy the open views. I took almost the same ski lift pic that I did several years ago, but this time there are hikers still asleep in the tents in the foreground. Perhaps they got up early to enjoy the sunrise and then climbed back into their bags for a couple more hours?
The descent to Mad Tom Notch Rd. (interesting name for the road) took about as long as the climb. Then it was back up again to the top of Styles and followed shortly by Peru (without much descent between them). Baker Peak is much lower than the others, but there is a short final climb up a rock face that is fun with some views. Griffith Lake is located between Peru and Baker and the trail passes by a campsite near the lake.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569318,"Our good weather luck finally ran out today and we hiked through some serious rain. Sticking with the NoBo description, the start from Danby-Landgrove was a gradual uphill, not too challenging. The trail follows a stream up to Little Rock Pond and then tracks around the pond. There were some tents at campsites along the edge. After crossing the stream the woods changes to pines. One of the most remarkable features of this section is two large sets of cairns in the pine forest There are a huge number of cairns, some individual and some bridge across to large trail rocks. I remember this scene, but I thought it was in another section. It’s so quiet under the pines that it’s almost magical. There is also a blue blaze trail to White Rocks just past the cairns. On the descent the trail passes a waterfall and a trail to the Green Wall shelter.  Its a steep slope that eventually leads to Rt. 140.
From that point there’s a big climb up Bear Mountain, also not steep but long and steady. Then a downhill and some smaller peaks. Passed a shelter. Had a view to the west of Rutland airport just before starting the downhill into Clarendon Gorge. This downhill was longer and tougher than I remembered. A steep grade with pine straw and not as many rocks or roots for footholds as I would have liked. Also, the rain began in earnest as I descended and I had to stop to put on my poncho. This downhill really slowed me down. As the rain wet down the trail, it made a tough situation worse. 
Finally, I made it to the gorge and the suspension bridge. I’m not a big fan of flexible suspension bridges, especially when they’re high in the air over a nasty rocky creek that’s flowing full. I try to think of Grandma Gatewood fording the river long before there was a suspension bridge over the river. Then I realize how much better off I am.
By this point in my hike, things were really wet. As I crossed VT 103  there was an overgrown meadow on the north side of the road that was loaded with water and my hiking pants were absolutely soaked (along with everything else I was wearing) before I made it back into the woods. The climb up Beacon Hill surprised me. I absolutely did not remember this climb. The lower part of the climb was up a boulder-filled gorge or ravine that seemed endless. This is good practice for the Whites, particularly Kinsman. After I made it through and crossed the top, there was a descent to Clarendon Shelter. And then came the second half of the climb up the remainder of Beacon Hill. Benton Mackaye would have liked this trail, it was pretty much up the fall line, not many switchbacks. There was a little more climbing after that, then Princess met me with the car and I finally got out of the rain. And it was off to check in at the Long Trail Inn.","Danby-Landgrove Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569465,"Internet connectivity and frankly, my energy level has been low for the past week. I’m so far behind in my posts that I’m summarizing 4 days in this entry. This covers the portion of the AT from Killington over to the White River crossing, taking us to less than a day’s hike from the VT-NH state border. 
Our first hike after relocating to The Long Trail Inn was over Killington Peak. Killington is the second highest mountain in Vermont and the highest peak on the AT in Vermont. It’s a long climb, but not terribly challenging. There is a shelter near the top, Cooper Lodge Shelter (but it’s essentially a standard AT shelter in spite of the “Lodge” in it’s name). However there is a better reward if one is willing to scale a tough quarter mile of rocks up to the top of Killington. The views from the peak are phenomenal and just a little further past the peak is a food & drink establishment at the top of the gondola lift up the Killington ski slopes on the other side of the mountain. It’s a large, modern facility with panoramic views of the Green Mountains in 3 directions. It’s well worth the effort in scaling the rocks to the peak. 
From the Killington Peak, the AT begins a long descent, interrupted for a stretch by a trek around Pico Peak. Pico is also home to a ski facility on the other side of the mountain from the AT. Just before reaching Pico the Sherburne Pass Trail leaves the AT and heads north around the other side of Pico from the AT and eventually rejoins the AT about 6 miles further on the AT. The AT descends until it crosses US 4 and then climbs to a point known as the Maine Junction. I haven’t mentioned it, but there is another long-distance trail in Vermont that extends from the southern to the northern border of Vermont known as the Long Trail. From the southern border with CT, the Long Trail follows the same path as the AT until it reaches the Maine Junction. At that point, the 2 trails split. The LT turns north and continues to the Maine border, while the AT heads easterly toward New Hampshire. The LT has a long history in VT and the plaque on Stratton Mt. indicates that the LT was conceived in 1909 and later in 1921 after construction of the LT was underway, Benton MacKaye expanded the concept into his vision for the AT. About a mile beyond the Maine Junction, the Sherburne Pass Trail reconnects with the AT. I have heard that initially the AT took the same path as the Sherburne Pass Trail, but was eventually rerouted to it’s current path west of the Sherburne. 
Over the next several days, Princess and I continued our trek along the AT generally heading east toward New Hampshire. We stayed 3 nights at the Long Trail Inn and then relocated on Monday to the Norwich Inn in Norwich, VT. After a nice day on Sunday, the weather has been fickle all week. The weather forecasts suggested that it would rain most of the week. And there was rain, but it was sporadic and sometimes before or after our hike. But it did wet down the trail and feed the mud on the trail. There were a number of highlights, but after a couple of days I can’t reconstruct the thread. I’ve included some photos we took along the way from the Maine Junction to our current point on the trail where Tigertown Rd. passes under I-89. 
We plan to stay here at the Norwich Inn through tomorrow (Wednesday, June 21) and then we’re going to scramble our schedule somewhat to fit the reservations that we were able to make in order to stay in some of the huts in the White Mountains. I’ll explain that more in upcoming entries.","Cold River Rdd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569604,"Today we did the last few miles in Vermont and crossed over the Connecticut River to New Hampshire. The starting point was Tigertown Rd. (actually the junction with Podunk Rd.). The section into Norwich was mostly a pretty woods trail, especially as the sun broke through the clouds and into the forest. But it began to seem very long. There was a sign posted near where the trail came out of the woods at Norwich asking for info regarding a man. It specifically said it was not associated with foul play, but rather concern for his welfare. I haven’t seen this before. After leaving the woods the trail followed Elm St. down into Norwich, a long (1 mile) downhill roadwork. We’ve always seen trail magic coolers along this stretch that the residents put out for hikers and this year was no different. Then there’s a turn onto Main St. and the trail heads straight for Hanover across the river. The Connecticut River marks the boundary between VT and NH. But as I learned on a previous post here on TJ, apparently there is some contention on exactly where in the river the state border lies. Regardless, there is an engraved stone in the (approximate) middle of the bridge that presumes to locate the boundary.
Once across the bridge, it’s an uphill hike into the downtown Hanover area. It’s clearly a college town with Dartmouth facilities all over. The AT goes right through the center of town (past a Starbucks even, be still my heart). It’s literally a couple of miles through town before the trail finally dives behind some of the Dartmouth athletic facilities and back into the woods. The there are a couple of not long, but rigorous climbs on a rocky trail. One short climb is steep enough that they have provided a knotted rope to help hikers scale the rocks. There are several hills and road crossings before the end of today’s section at Three Mile road.
Besides the sign in the woods about the man, I’ve also included a shot of a poster we saw in Norwich. Some in Vermont still “Feel the Burn”.","Tigertown Rd.
