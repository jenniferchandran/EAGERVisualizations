Mei Liber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559054,"Made it to Amicalola Falls. It's a warm 39 degrees here and misty. We were able to find a campsite close to the showers in the campground and were able to get a nice hot meal at Amicalola Lodge. The view of the falls is absolutely gorgeous from the top. Tomorrow we start day 1 of a 166-mile hike to Fontana Dam (dropped off my car there earlier so I need to make my way back). Hoping to cover about 8.8 miles all the way to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian trail.","Amicalola Falls

The days are getting warmer ~ 70 deg was the high, and 42 will be the low. The big mountain of the day was Sassafras mountain, which is the first big sweat generator for most Appalachian trail thru-hikers. Total mileage for the day was about 10.1. We're hoping to make it to Neel Gap tomorrow evening and find ally get to shower and have some pizza  Dogs are doing well, no chafing with their new packs and paws seem to be in good condition. They are definitely the stars of the trail so far!! News has traveled up and down the trail that there are 2 dobermans making their way to Neels Gap","Horse Gap

Mei Liber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559906,"When we arrived at Neels Gap, we learned that several people have become infected with the Norovirus, a ""winter bug"" that has become associated with the Appalachian trail. People are thought to contract the disease from contaminated water sources and food. It makes me nervous because we have been staying and drinking from the same water sources as the same people who have become infected with the Norovirus. Symptoms usually appear within 12-48 hours of contamination, and consist of vomiting, diahrrea, low grade fever, and general tiredness. Luckily, neither Erwin nor myself have shown any symptoms of Norovirus since our arrival to Neels Gap on April 10th. Let's hope it stays that way. Please send kind thoughts :/","Woody Gap

Mei Liber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559902,"We took a zero day yesterday (April 10th) and stayed at the Blood Mountain cabins at Neels Gap. It was soo nice to take a shower and get our laundry done for free after hiking and camping in the woods for 4 days! 
Today was a tough day since we hiked 11.5 miles, the most we've done in a day since starting this adventure. The day did get better though after we received some trail magic in the form of water and beer from the gentleman in the photo. This unsung trail angel is a retired major in the air force who worked on A-10s. I was very honored to have met him today and wanted to give him a shout out in this trail journal.","Neels Gap

I've also been meeting lots of really cool, fun people on the trail and have been socializing more than writing my adventures! The crew is still doing well despite the long, grueling days of hiking more than 10 miles over uneven, rocky, steep uphill and downhill terrain. Both Bruno and Leila are doing FANTASTIC and have caught the attention of many hikers. Everyone is extremely impressed with their on-trail behavior and how healthy they look (kudos to mama). I know that a tiny piece of Erwin actually likes trekking this trail as well despite the substandard conditions he's being forced to live in  the poor guy sprained his ankle a few days ago before we hit Unicoi gap, however, and had to take a few days off to recover at the top of Georgia hostel. That place is awesome by the way. Sir Packs a lot runs the place and does a very fine job of helping hikers relax and not worry about anything except hiking. Despite the reviews he's probably gotten on Facebook and Guthook I like the guy. He personally promised to mail a package we wanted sent back to Erwins house when the capabilities of his hostel couldn't accommodate.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Mei Liber,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562968,"Hi all, 
Sorry for the hiatus in trail journal entries. I successfully finished my section hike from Amicalola Falls to Fontana Dam on April 27th just as I'd planned!! For the most part, I consider it a successful hike with no major issues. I had to go off trail to Knoxville because Leila caught a nasty bug that was making her throw up and have diarrhea and Erwin sprained his ankle for the 5th time!! It was only for a day, however, and both of them are doing fine now. I sprained my left ankle myself on the 2nd to last day 2/10ths of a mile from the shelter, with 6.6 miles to go to Fontana Dam the next day.  Those 6.6 miles felt like an eternity the next day as I limped along, but thankfully my hiking partner (Wine Country) was also injured and could limp at the same pace as me. We made for a very entertaining pair of hikers.  With 1.5 miles to go and the rain pouring down upon us as we stumbled to Fontana Dam, we were picked up and shuttled to a room at Fontana Lodge, courtesy of my other trail friend Slacker Rojo. 
I left for Ohio the very next day to attend the Buckeye trailFest.  That was a great weekend where i got to meet Buckeye Trail Association members and some really cool people like Tomfoolery and Stacy ""Ironwill"" Kozel, a woman who has hiked the entire Appalachian trail with a pair of leg braces. 
Today I came back on the trail and it has never felt better to be back home. I was reunited with Wine Country and another one of my trail friends named Homeward Bound. We hiked a total of 7.1 miles today, a rather easy day, but the sun was hot and punishing. Both of them are glad to be out of the smokies. I had to sit the smokies out because I've been hiking with my two dogs, Bruno and Leila and the smokies has a very strict no-dog policy. Ill eventually have to go back and do that section on my own next year without the doggies :(
We're slated to do a 13-mile day tomorrow. Weather is supposed to be fair, however, it will rain tomorrow night.","Standing Bear Farm
