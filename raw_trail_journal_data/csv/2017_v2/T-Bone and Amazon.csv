T-Bone and Amazon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555853,"Today is journal entry number one! We have been planning and researching for over 9 months, and getting very excited to finally start our section hike April 1, 2017. We love to travel and especially love beautiful vistas! We started walking for exercise, and realized we enjoyed it. We became aware of the Appalachian Trail after traveling the area for some rookie baseball games.After researching the trail, it only made us want to start it. The reason for this journal is to keep our families informed on where we are and give them a little information about how we are doing. I will put some pictures up when I can. We invite anyone who is interested to follow along on our adventure, and feel free to email us with any questions, or to just say hello. Especially if we met you on the trail in person! Our adventure will begin soon, we will see what tomorrow brings us.",,Getting Ready for our Adventure,"Mar 07, Tue",0
T-Bone and Amazon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557466,"Trail journal 2. Well it is really getting close, we are leaving in less than a week. We have prepared as best that we can. I just hope we can carry it all. Still walking and training until we leave. I'm looking forward to the walk, after overcoming cancer and not being able to walk at times. I feel I can walk in the mountains with a few black bears and snakes. This will be a walk in a park. I'm just thankful to have the opportunity. Sometimes one just has to look outside the box and just get up and do it!",,Getting Close,"Mar 24, Fri",0
T-Bone and Amazon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558094,"Trail Journal 3, We leave tomorrow. We have everything in our backpacks and a few more things to stuff in. One last mention about our preparation and about us. We starting walking at Crenshaw Park in Pasadena TX. This is where we met our friend Jesus, he is 86 years old and could out walk most people on the track. I'm thinking the reason he is doing so well at that age, could it be that he exercises (walks) most days a week. Of course we meet several people out walking everyday, normally the same ones everyday. After a while we started walking at Holly Bay Park/Armand Bayou Park with our backpacks weighted down. Now after all the researching and planning it is finally here, we leave tomorrow. I will have to say that the planning and researching is part of the whole experience. We will miss our kids, our grandkids and our dog and our extended family... It will take a couple of days to travel and playing golf on the way, but should be on the AT by 4-1-2017.",,Leaving Tomorrow,"Mar 29, Wed",0
T-Bone and Amazon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559642,"We left March 28, 2017 our good friends Kathy and Rick gave us a ride to Front Royal, Virginia Rick walked with us starting at Hogs Wallow Gap and walked with us for approx.4 hours and then he saw us off into the woods. Tbone found a walking stick and he has been whittling on. Thank goodness I have walking sticks as the trail is very rocky. We walked to our hut at Gravel Springs which we filtered water and set up camp for the night. Being our first night we did not know what to expect. There was quite a few people at the hut. It was a weekend and there was a cub scouts crew there. When we arrived at shelter and will have to admit we where exhausted and tired. We set up camp, cooked our food and went to bed.","Hoggs Wallow Gap

T-Bone and Amazon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559645,"We woke up from Gravel Springs Hut. (same as a shelter) They call them huts in Shenandoah National Park instead of shelters. We walked up another mountain today approx. 7 miles up and down. Ended up at Jeremy's Run Trail Spring where we filtered water, we decided to stealth camp near there for the night. We hung our bear bag and cooked our meal for the evening. There is something very peaceful about sitting at camp in the woods and all you hear is the wind blowing the trees and leaves around. And next was a wood pecker, pecking away at a tree near by. It is pretty chili out tonight thinking around 37Deg, better than last night 31Deg. I was awakened in the morning to a bird singing a song. Tbone (The Whittler) saw a large Doe in the early morning.","Gravel Springs Hut
