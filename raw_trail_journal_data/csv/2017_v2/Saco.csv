Saco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551659,"At 70 years old it has been my dream for 40+ years to walk the entire AT. i grew up in Maine and spent lots time in the woods. I confess to have minimal knowledge and experience in backpacking, hiking and that it takes to be successful in this challenge. i have backpacked once in my life for 2 days in the white mountains and loved it. But having to raise 4 very busy kids we were limited to bike, boat and tent camping with only short hikes. Now my family is grown and with retirement around the corner, and my son in law Jamie, (do not know his trail name) an avid backpacker and hiker he has me inspired to train and fulfill my dream. i am in great health and walk/run daily 4-5 miles. We are planning monthly weekend hikes to experiment with gear and pace. on his recommendation i am putting together an assortment of items he has recommended or i have researched. i also have been reading a lot of AT journals and am totally amazed at the focus and determination these people have. The love of nature no matter how brutal she can be it is always followed by the best day ever. i am hoping for my first pre-hike in December. i am looking to do many pre-hikes with Jamie until i am comfortable enough to solo hike training. my plan is to stay in my comfort zone and increase my training slowly up to a 2 week mountainous hike. Starting date will be determined on how well my progress is and my confidence level. i wrestle with coming up with a reason to finish when things really begin to get difficult, almost every journal i have read the hikers have a deep emotional place they go to for strength. So with that, see you after my first pre-hike.",,Mt. Katahdin,"Nov 20, Sun",0
Saco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551910,"Parked at The Great Smokey Mountains Deep Creek Campground near Bryson City, NC. Beautiful clear weather predicted, no campfires permitted in the Smokey Mountain because of the drought and fires throughout NC, and Ga. Hiked with my 2 daughters Erin and Meghan and their husbands Jamie and Patrick. Jamie is a very experienced hiker and very knowledgeable backpacker and familiar with the region. The hike up Deep Creek was relatively easy and beautiful scenic nature all around. We spotted some deer about 3 miles from starting point drinking from the creek. Arrived at 58 early afternoon and set up camp, had dinner and chatted until bedtime. No fire and the temps were going down fast so bedtime was early. Very quiet night with only the sound of the nearby creek.","Deep Creek Campground

Saco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551911,"In the morning we took our time having coffee and a little breakfast, filled up our water and packed up for the trip to Campsite 46. We hiked Deep Creek trail to Martins Gap trail, a moderate climb and down hill hike to Indian Creek Trail and on to Campsite 46. Arrived a campsite 46 around noon, set up camp. Campsite 46 lacked any flat areas to set up tents and the creek was on the other side of the trail. Jamie fished, the girls and Patrick hike down for water and explore at little. I just sat back in my camp chair, had lunch and took in the beauty and solitude around me. Had dinner at dusk and chatted after dark until the cold started moving in. Early bed again with temps in the 20s. Restless sleep due to the sloping terrain but manage to get a good rest. Nice a warm in my 0 degree marmot bag.","Deep Creek Campground 59

Saco,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551912,"Early morning wake up at Campsite 46, morning dew on the tent fly turned to ice. Packed up quickly for the return to our cars at Deep creek campground. A very easy walk down the Indian Creek trail, lots of bridges crossing over sections of Indian creek. 3 miles in met up with Deep Creek and finished hike on a beautiful crisp morning and had to scrape and warm up cars to get rid of the frost covered windows. Had a great trip and only had 1 equipment problem. Either my new hiking shoes do not agree with my toes on down hill trails or they were too loose...Before I return them to REI I will do several more day hikes to see if the problem returns....ok now off to Atlanta but a nice stop at a Taco Bell for lots of food....","Indian Creek Campground 46
