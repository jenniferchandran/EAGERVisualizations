CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554528,"There are some stark realities to consider when planning a thru hike. First, the official length of the AT this year is 2189.8 miles from Springer Mountain in north Georgia to Mount Katahdin in northern Maine. If you average hiking 15 miles per day it will take about 146 hiking days – roughly 21 weeks. If you take one day off per week to rest and resupply you are at about 168 days. Give or take a few days for whatever comes up and you are at 180 days, or six months. Early on I may limit myself to under 10 miles per day, and I hope to hike more than 15 miles per day once I get my “trail legs”. You can analyze this to death, but it’s easy to see that there are a lot of “if’s”. Now for some numbers. Depending on whose statistics you use we can expect somewhere between 3000 and 4000 hikers to start from Georgia this year, with the first few brave souls starting in early January and the majority of hikers having started by around mid April. During about mid February to mid April there are crowds of hikers all up and down the southern trail and choking the shelters, campsites and towns along the way. Some of these folks will drop off before they have left the shadow of Springer Mountain. Some will abandon their trip by Neel Gap about 30 miles north of Springer. By the time you get to Damascus, Virginia (a small town just over the Virginia border from Tennessee and about 470 miles from the start), the numbers will have thinned out significantly. Again depending on whose numbers you use, somewhere between about 10% and up to 25% of those who start a northbound (NOBO) thru hike will actually finish at Katahdin. There are about as many reasons to drop out as there are hikers, but these can include disillusionment, loss of will to do it, injury, running out of money or time, sickness, family matters, etc. My plan is to start near the beginning of March and look at the 6 months ending late August. They sort of close the mountain in Maine in October so you are not guaranteed the opportunity to summit Katahdin beyond that point, even if you are a thru hiker coming from Georgia. It may be cold in the south at the start with this early start date, but I want the cushion at the end so if I make it that far I have the time to finish.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554529,"Before I go any farther I want to say a bit about my biggest cheerleader in this adventure, and the love of my life. During my longer section hikes over a decade ago my wife Marlene was so supportive and encouraged me to go out and hike each year. She understands my love of being out there on the trail. Each year she encouraged me to plan the time and go do it. Due to changes in our lives at that time, hiking long trips seemed to take a back seat to the other responsibilities of life. In the time until now I have been on dozens of short hikes in this area. She keeps encouraging me to enjoy it. When talk of retirement became real in December she was the first to encourage me to go for it this year. It will not be easy for her while I am gone. We rarely find the need to be apart for more than a couple of days so we will miss each other very much. Many things could happen in a 6 month period and it would be much easier for her if I were here to handle things. She understands all of this and is willing to let me go. Proverbs 18:22 says “He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord”. This has been true for me. Thank you, Sweetheart. I love you. dp",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Tue",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554530,"On previous trips I have hiked the trail from Springer Mountain to Daleville, Virginia (near Roanoke) – about 725 miles. Some have asked why I don’t start there and continue north. Well, I could. However, my ideal hike would be a thru hike defined as starting at Springer Mountain and finishing at Katahdin in one trip in one calendar year. That way I get to hike north with spring, and in the company of this year’s “class” of aspiring thru hikers. That’s a big part of the experience. If I am unable to finish I will not regret this approach. First, I like the part of the trail I have already done and would love to see it again. Second, if I am not able to finish the thru hike this year I can always go from the ending spot north on other trips if I am able. But mostly I think that if I start at Daleville and go north and things go well I will always regret not having done the thru hike the way I prefer. I am pretty organized and tend to do things in a logical manner. Going end to end is what I want to do, and I will live with however that turns out.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554531,"It turns out that most of my gear is in good shape and I am able to use it. I replaced a few items and repaired a few and they seem to be functioning fine on the practice hikes I have taken. I put seam sealer on my tent and no leaks in the overnighter in the rain as I listened to the Super Bowl on my short wave radio from my tent in a local state park. I still have several pepsi can stoves that burn alcohol, but also have bought a JetBoil to use at least during the coldest part of the hike. Unsure if I will switch to the alcohol stove later or not, but I like my homemade pepsi can stove so I may use it just for the fun of it. The rest of the gear changes mostly have to do with more cold weather gear and stocking up on shoes and clothes that have some wear or will wear out as I go. The other part of getting ready is getting me ready. I’m 12 years older and a little out of practice. I was afraid that when I shouldered a trail-weight pack for the first time I’d feel like that ant with a refrigerator strapped to his back that I saw as a kid watching cartoons. It wasn’t that bad but I did have a reality check and expect to be very careful at first. I cannot get caught up in making miles and not giving my body a chance to build up to that level of workout. The rest of the effort is centered around getting ready to leave. There are “to do” lists to take care of. Yard work, paying bills, home maintenance, vehicle maintenance, etc. I think its coming together but for the longest time I added two items to the list for every one I checked off. Wish me luck.",,Getting Ready,"Feb 10, Fri",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555418,"Tomorrow morning Marlene and I will load up and leave Birmingham for Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia. On Friday morning we will head up forest service road 42 for the trailhead. Not sure how the details will work out and some of it may depend on the weather or the condition of the road, but she may hike to the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail on Springer Mountain with me (and back) or just drop me off and head back down to the paved road. It almost seems unreal for this trip to be actually starting. I had a head start in some ways since I had most of the gear and the experience from previous hikes. But there have been dozens of details to work out and you finally have to just load up and go. I am so excited to be out there and see how the trip goes. There are people to meet and the challenge of getting on the trail and getting my body up to speed for that much physical activity. There is a kind of intensity to the experience of being out in the woods and suddenly away from everything familiar. There is also the adjustment to having a nearly 2200 mile hike instead of 200 miles and 2 weeks. So much to get your mind around. With all this activity neither Marlene nor I have a good feel for how we will adjust to this separation. We have been married for over 40 years and have spent at most a few days apart. There does not seem to be a way to know what that will be like. If I am able to hike the whole trail it will take up to 6 months. In todays world we will be able to keep in touch much more than was possible even a few years ago. But there is still just the physical distance to live through. We want to adjust to this temporary time, go on with what we each have to do, and also remain close in our relationship while apart. Please pray that we can do that. The next time I update will probably be from a trail town library. I plan to write a journal daily and update as I can. Marlene will update with a few details from our check ins by phone. We will see how that goes and how much we are able to do. Thanks for your interest in my hike. I am ready to go.",,Leaving For The Trail In the Morning,"Mar 01, Wed",0
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556033,"Today was the first day for my hike. We stayed at the lodge at Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia last night. Marlene and I got up early and had breakfast. Everything was packed and ready so we headed out to find our way through the north Georgia mountain roads. Marlene was driving my F-150 pickup. We found the turnoff for US Forest Service road 42 and off into the woods. The road was in great shape (for a mountain road) and the 6.5 miles up to the parking lot went by without incident – at least from my perspective – I know Marlene was anxious about the trip up and especially the trip down. A few vehicles at the dirt parking lot. We parked and immediately started for the summit of Springer Mountain, .9 miles south on the Appalachian Trail. There was a very raw wind and it was cold. The trail had ice and ice crystals along the way. Marlene has been sick with bronchitis and about half way up she asked if she could turn back and wait for me at the truck. I was relieved because I knew the weather and her condition was giving her a hard time. I went ahead to the summit and quickly signed the register, got a few pictures and left. I had been here 3 times before so I made it short and sweet. Wanted to get back to Marlene as soon as possible. At .2 miles back I took the side trail to the Springer Mountain shelter, but only long enough to get a picture, then back down to the parking lot. When I arrived I did a few chores and Marlene hovered around me as we knew what came next. When I was in the Marines and had to go back from leave or was going to Viet Nam I would wake up the morning of departure and begin to steel myself for the coming time of leaving family. There was no hard shell around me this day. This was very hard and I still can feel that extra hard and clinging hug from my sweetheart today.   I made her drive off in the truck before I took my first steps on the trail northward. How hard that was.Down from the summit the weather was much nicer with less wind and the day began to warm a little. I was at the bottom fairly quickly at Stover Creek, and crossed on a log and rock hopping crossing. I knew the old shelter was gone and the new shelter was somewhere around but I did not find it. A mile or two later I saw a sign for a shelter and sure enough the new shelter was off to the right – very nice – and I stopped in for a few minutes. I quickly came to Three Forks and took a pack-off break. While there a hiker came up behind me and was confused about his location. He asked why he had come so far and had not found Springer Mountain. I explained that he had probably gone north from the parking lot but the summit was .9 miles south. Disappointed, he decided to hike all the way back about 3.5 miles to the parking lot and then to the summit. I felt bad but understood his wanting to see the southern terminus and get off right. On past 3 forks to Long Creek Falls and ended the day at Hawk Mountain shelter. The shelter was full and there were probably 30 or 40 tents and hammocks. I got my tent set up and cooked supper. Spent most of the remaining daylight doing chores (filtering water, etc) and talking with the many hikers milling around the shelter area. A great day. I did well – was very tired but encouraged that I could still do this. Shortly before dark I checked and had a text from Marlene that she had made it back to the paved road on schedule and was pretty far into her return trip back to Birmingham. Praise the Lord for that information. That was the best news I could have to end the day. Hikers settle in for the night as darkness starts to settle in. It makes for a pretty long night to be bounded by sunrise and sunset but we get used to it. Very tired but very happy for the progress of day 1. Goodnight Sweetheart.","
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Mar 03, Fri",8.10
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556038,"Today began at Hawk Mountain shelter. I was awake many times during the night and back to sleep so I got plenty of rest. You can almost tell what time it is as the dawn approaches but has not yet started to change the lighting. Then on to a very slight rosy glow in the east, which comes on pretty quickly from there as the long ridgeline off to the east is edged in a fiery glow before the ball of the sun comes into view. It was cold overnight but I was warm with all the clothes on plus my sleeping bag and liner. The tent did well, even in the wind, and I was snug. I was surrounded by tents and hammocks, people everywhere, and when the first one begins to rustle around the entire group is signaled to get the day started.Everyone was breaking camp, eating and packing up. We were all rusty as we tried to figure out where everything was and where everything goes. Finally I was ready and left – probably about 8 (Marlene was right, I will need a watch). Before I got back down the shelter side trail and all the way back to the AT, I stopped to shed several layers. It was a cold night and raw morning but the physical activity of carrying the pack and hiking uphill warms you very quickly. Down to Hightower Gap and later Horse Gap, then up to Sassafras Mountain and down again to Cooper Gap, up Justus Mountain and down to Justus Creek – get used to that. It was a difficult day 2, and honestly my outlook was up and down, depending on whether I was going up or down. I was planning to hike fewer miles for a week or two to give myself time to break in, but I had gotten excited and thought about going to Ramrock Mountain like last time and then on to Neels Gap on day 3. Today’s hike was tough and I stopped here and will do 4 days to Neels Gap as originally planned. I’d like to say I’m doing that to be prudent, but really it’s kicking my butt. So I planned to hike to Lance Creek tomorrow and on to Neels Gap the next day.I am at Gooch Mountain shelter. Tent set up and many of the same hikers and some new ones are here. I remember this shelter, but the trail looks completely different as it is a winter setting and it was May when I came through here the last time. Gives it a whole different look. We have a good group here tonight and most hikers are new enough to want to talk about gear, food, etc. so we’ve been chattering away all over the area.One thing that is different is the ability to send messages if you are in the right place. It is spotty and I have my phone off as I hike. But, I turn it on at some of the summits and have gotten service – sometimes in and out but a text message can get thru. That has been nice and Marlene and I have kept in touch, even if cryptic. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556039,"Up and ready in a crowd again. We are all in the same boat and having the same experiences. The trail does that as the group has all ages, backgrounds, lifestyles and life stages but everybody puts that aside and we are just hikers. So much fun. The details of the morning are about the same as every day. Today is Sunday. There are lots of weekend hikers and bikers out. Shortly I came to Gooch Gap and McGuyver (sp?) was there and set up to do trail magic. Trail magic is the term given to the experience of having someone come out at access points along the trail to give hikers a little kindness purely out of their own generosity. McGuyver had a grill set up and cooked sausage, eggs, etc, and had fruit, drinks, a place to offload trash and lots of advice from his experience on his 2015 thru hike from Georgia to Maine. His kindness powered me all morning.It was a very hard morning for me. I made it to Woody Gap and had lunch with Strider (sp?) and Tin Cup. There were lots of people around and we got lots of questions. Fun. The next obstacle was Big Cedar Mountain. That was the hardest so far and I began to be concerned about doing this. It was a warm day and the climb was not just upward, but also pulling up over huge boulders and rocks. It was a struggle. I did have time to myself as I hiked alone (almost always do) and I like that. I got to Lance Creek fairly early. Got set up right away, filtered water and changed into evening clothes as it gets cold almost as soon as you stop hiking. Strider and I were first in so we got good tent sites right above the creek. I felt better quickly and we talked as the other hikers came in. So we rested, ate and got into the tents for the night at sunset – our routine so far. It’s funny how your outlook can change with circumstances. So hard as you struggle along on some never-ending climb but then when you arrive for the night and get a little food and rest you are crazy enough to look forward to the next day. Great experience. I slept on and off all night. It began to rain around 3:00. When I would wake up I couldn’t help but think of how hard I’m struggling on the uphill parts. Hope to get my trail legs soon. The rest helps. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556041,"Very early and still dark and I was awake and started to pack up – mostly by the feel of things – just to see if I could do it in the dark. It was still sprinkling and I wanted to pack up before harder rains might come. I heard other hikers moving around as well. We were set up on a long narrow ledge which went up and over small hills forming the creek bank, spread out single file for a long way. I was packed and eating before full daylight. Today the goal is Neels Gap – a mental and physical milestone. They say a significant percent of the hikers who start at Springer Mountain will drop off by Neels Gap – don’t worry, I’m going on. Motivated, I was out first and on a big climb right away. Lots of beautiful ridge line walking (all days so far) I had a very good walk alone. I led the pack until the turnoff to Woods Hole shelter where I took a break. Four or five hikers passed me there – Strider, Tear Drop, EZ, Mammoth as I remember. Caught them at the start of the climb to Blood Mountain summit on their break and we went up together. Well, Strider went up in 11 minutes, so that must be some kind of a record. It was a very tough climb but I did well and am more encouraged. Blood Mountain is either the highest peak in Georgia or the highest one on the trail in Georgia. Either way a very big climb. It was foggy and cold with virtually no views. We had a good time taking each other’s pictures in the stone shelter with fog and clouds blowing in the open window spaces in the stone walls – very gray and eerie looking. We had our fun and moved out. I hiked with Strider all the way down from the rocky, boulder filled summit to Neels Gap. Good time talking and hiking together. Strider is 6’5” tall so his stride is probably a foot longer than mine so I expect to say goodbye as we move along. Neels Gap has Mountain Crossings outfitter store and is a sort of mecca for hikers who make it to that location. The trail goes through the breezeway of their building and out the back to start uphill again.I got my mail drop box for resupply and bought a few items at the store, but first things first – I got a PEPPERONI PIZZA, and ate the whole thing. Real food. Tastes so good after all that trail food. I hung out for a while and looked at all the cool gear and food, and talked with the hikers and the store folks. Met and talked with “Miss Janet”, a famous trail icon who used to run a hostel in Erwin, TN, and now is kind of a roving presence in her van along the trail, especially this time of year as the hiker bubble moves north. Strider and I decided to hike on. I left first for Baggs Creek – about 4 miles north – while Strider did some chores. Baggs Creek is not in my guidebook. It was an entry in the guide Strider has on his phone but we decided to just go for it and meet up later. Turns out Baggs Creek is just a location, but not a creek. I had a very good hike alone to this unmarked and unknown spot. I finally stopped to wait for him and unpacked some of my gear to dry out in the wind – dried very quickly. He came in about 5:00 and we hiked back about ¼ mile to find a spring and set up there. Honestly, we have no idea where we are. Ate, hung our food on a bear bag line (suspended from a tree branch parallel to the ground to keep bears from getting it). We are in our tents and ready for sleep. It was a good day. Planning to get to Low Gap shelter tomorrow. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Lance Creek Campsite

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556047,"Up today at daylight, packed, ate and ready to go. I could not keep up with Strider (as expected) so he moved ahead. Cowrock Mountain was a huge climb and I was struggling again on the climbs. Made Tesnatee Gap, then up Wildcat Mountain and down to Hogpen Gap – much later I made it to Low Gap shelter. Strider was there and ready to leave so we got a picture of the two of us and he was off. I don’t expect to see him again soon, but it is funny as I read hiker journals how someone like that will show up again during your hike even if 500 miles north. Papa and a few of the others were also at Low Gap but it was early afternoon so I decided to hike on a few miles. I hiked to Chattahoochee Gap – about 5 miles further. It got cold, windy, and started to rain and I decided Chattahoochee Gap was where I would stop if I did not find a campsite sooner. Chattahoochee Gap is a saddle between two mountains and got the brunt of the weather. I set up my tent in high winds and light blowing rain, tossed everything inside and got into clothes for the night. Ate food that did not require cooking and lay down to watch the evening approach. It was a pretty stark situation but I felt ok. Suddenly my outside tent pole – using one of my trekking poles - collapsed because of a very high wind swell. I got out to take care of it and found a large rock to place on the tent peg to help hold it. I had prayed to ask God to protect me and He had that problem occur before it got dark so I could more easily handle it. Hard wind swells all night with hard blowing rain. My tent whipped and strained and I prayed for it to hold – it was a great night. I would sleep awhile and then wake up to listen and see the power of the storm. I was safe and snug all night. Praise the Lord for His protection.I was glad Marlene was not aware of the situation as she might worry how I was. I thought of her and tried to keep my head as the day was ending and there seemed to be no good place to set up except the exposed gap. But it was kind of a cozy night in a strange sort of way. I thought of her often during my wake up times and knew it would be alright. So good to have someone who cares. Goodnight Sweetheart","Baggs Creek

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556050,"Woke at Chattahoochee Gap still in the storm. Quickly got into hiking clothes and did all I could inside the tent before breaking it down. Packed as fast and I could and moved on. It was very cold until I got to lower elevations. I’m glad I did not hike ahead last night because there were no tent sites ahead for a long time and I would have been in the dark and in the storm without having set up for the night. Very grateful to the Lord for answering my prayers and leading me to set up for the night at Chattahoochee Gap.The first climb up to Blue Mountain shelter was very difficult. Really today was the hardest yet by far as I looked ahead at the terrain and the huge climbs and descents. At the shelter I took all my gear and clothes and dried them in the wind and they were dry in about 15 minutes – it was great to have them dry (and lighter to carry). Blue Mountain and especially the shelter area are known to be very exposed and windy almost all the time. I ate more for breakfast while at the shelter, then packed up again and left for the huge downhill to Unicoi Gap. There the hikers were treated to cheese, oranges and drinks by Laurie and her friend. That tasted so good. Packed up and left for the big climb up Rocky Mountain out of the gap – up about 1,100 feet – and the name of the mountain was very appropriate – rocks to get over most of the way – very difficult. Then a long and very hard descent over rocks and roots down to Indian Grave Gap – hard like the climb. This was followed by a 1,300 foot climb up Tray Mountain – difficult but I seemed to get a second wind after stopping to eat a second lunch half way up. I needed the encouragement as the struggle had me wondering if I could do this. But, beautiful views from the top of Tray Mountain – which is a short area of exposed huge chunks of rock and then immediately down again. Then a fairly easy ½ mile down to the shelter – Tray Mountain Shelter. I was anticipating that if I could get to the summit then this half mile to the shelter would be a time to recover my strength and perspective, and that was exactly what happened. I felt much better by the time I arrived. Many hikers were there. I set up quickly and spent some time chatting with the various groups. Very stiff and sore when I first got here but it was so good to be here after this hardest day so far. It is a good group here tonight and I talked with hikers by the fire ring. Made a trip down to the spring to filter water and we had a great time of talking about our hikes down there. A big crowd here tonight. Got into my tent before dark and saw many lights down below in the valleys. Then a bright moon came out for most of the night. I woke up and wondered what was the bright light, thinking there was a hiker standing outside with his head lamp shining in my direction, but it was the moon – so pretty. Slept well after the hardest day so far. Traded some messages with Marlene as we could make contact. That is so good to have that tie back home. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Chattahoochee Gap

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556052,"Town day! I awoke motivated to get ready and move out. Today I would get to Dick’s Creek Gap and hitchhike into Hiawassee Georgia for the night. I am considering taking a zero day (no hiking). I had that incentive for the day and was packed and ready soon. Out to the main trail and a 600 foot descent to Wolfpen Gap. It was a pretty day, later very hot – about 70 degrees – about 55 degrees is perfect. But the scenery was great all day. There were many ups and downs of a few hundred feet but the big obstacle for the day was Kelly Knob at 4,126 feet. I moved along well and am starting to wonder if after a week I am going to get better on the climbs – feel like that is starting to happen. (It also helps that I’ve eaten most of the food in my pack). I finally got to the summit of Kelly Knob and could tell I was gaining the highest point and over the top and starting down – felt so good. There were a few more challenges – down to the Deep Gap shelter side trail and up Powell Mountain – but Dick’s Creek Gap was definitely ahead. Finally I began to hear the occasional vehicle noise and came out onto this major road crossing. Right across the road Greeter, Bigfoot and Miss Bigfoot had a huge spread set up – Trail Magic again. They had too many things to remember… But hot dogs with condiments, burgers, pasta, various fruits, drinks – just hard to describe how good that was. Steady stream of about 10 hikers at a time were there – hikers from everywhere. Finally I was settling into a food-induced coma while sitting in a real chair – funny there is no chair like a real chair – logs don’t do it. Miss Bigfoot offered to shuttle me into town and I learned that she and Bigfoot have lived/are living in my home town and the next one nearby – Maple Lake and Buffalo, MN. They did not offer their real names so that is all I know of them. We arrived in Hiawassee at the Budget Inn. I planned to stay for two nights. I got a room and did laundry and had a shower (so nice) before going to a local BBQ place for ribs – more real food!! I woke up today (Friday, March 10) and checked weather, finding that rain and snow is expected the next 4 days – at least some of each during that time. Struggled to decide if going out today would be better but there seems to be no way to avoid the weather without taking several days off – if even then. So I resupplied at Ingles Grocery and am here at the library. Please pray for the next section – lots of big obstacles and the weather. I need God’s protection and wisdom for this. Bye Sweetheart.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556379,"Today began at Budget Inn at Hiawassee. John the shuttle driver picked me up at 7:00 as planned. Quick stop at Hardee's for breakfast to go and then up the mountain to Dick's Creek Gap. Talked with John on the way up and had an enjoyable time. The climb out of the gap was steep but fairly short and I was soon on a beautiful side hill hike along a ridge, watching the early morning woods and the sun a long, long way off coming over line after line of peaks and ridges to the east. Several significant climbs of 500 to 800 feet and I passed the turn to Plumorchard Gap Shelter. Progress ok. I was looking ahead to the NC/GA border sign for another major milestone - both for my physical progress and mental encouragement. There were 3 day hikers at the sign and we traded picture-taking duties and hiked on together .1 miles to Bly Gap and the famous gnarled oak tree (which they called the ""Sitting Tree"") and had lunch together. From here it was progressively colder and I could almost predict the arrival of snow flakes. Sounds scary but almost perfect hiking weather.   From Bly Gap NC wants a pound of flesh to allow you in and the climb up Courthouse Bald, about 900', serves that purpose well. Then down to Sassafrass Gap and up to Muskrat Creek Shelter for the night. Tonite I took a space in the shelter since we expected snow overnite - last shelter space available. This turned out to be a good thing. Cooked, ate, filtered water and dressed for a very cold night. By dark the snow was accumulating and coming down in big heavy flakes. Getting up in the middle of the night to go to the privy was an interesting experience, but I could see without a light or glasses on due to the white snow and black rocks and tree trunks. More fun to look back on than to do. So it was a good day and I did well enough. I needed to test myself and my equipment in snow and it turned out well.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556382,"Good morning North Carolina snowstorm! It was good to be under a roof overnight - making it much easier to pack up and get ready. I was first out and faced with locating and breaking the trail. The AT is marked by the occasional 2"" x 6"" white rectangle painted verticallly on trees, rocks or whatever is handy. Snow covers the rocks and also sticks to the tree trunks. Sometimes you have to go by intuition - especially on a foggy gray early morning walk in the woods and mountains. The trees and especially rhododendrens were full of snow and the shrubs were bent over and heavy with the stuff blocking the trail. I would swing a treking pole up to knock off the snow and the shrub would spring to attention as I went past - that was the best scenario - there were others. Today included the long grinding climb up Standing Indian Mountain. Crunch, crunch, crunch and swish, swish, swish as I would walk along on ice or loose snow. Took a break at Standing Indian Shelter and then just gutted it out for the rest of the day to Carter Gap shelter over fairly familiar obstacles - was a long and challenging day. A large crowd at the shelter. I set up my tent - tents all over the shelter area - and we all had snow clumps falling from the trees and rhododendrens for the rest of the day and evening. But the wind blew and eventually during the night the snow was mostly down and the wind blew the tents dry, with some ice clumps clinging to the tent fabric. Probably the coldest night so far - in the teens. Could not communicate with Marlene much today at all or overnight. I miss that and wondered if she was worried. I'm fine though.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556385,"Most difficult breakdown of my campsite so far - cold and windy and fairly stark conditions. Took it slow and steady trying to do everything but take down the tent until the last possible minute. Finally stuffed it all into my pack and started out. A frozen trail is better than wet and slushy so I had better footing and crunched along. Many climbs and descents but two stand out. First Big Butt Mountain with steep cliffside trail and a precarious tread clinging to the mountain side along rocks, roots, or root balls from struggling trees and shrubs clinging on for dear life to the mountain with whatever footing they could get. However, I had been through this part of the trail 15 years ago. It was much improved this time. I got through without incident. The next thing of note is Albert Mountain - extremely steep mountain with a fire tower on top. Saw the tower as I approached the area and wow - I have to go up there? On other hikes through here I could not see the mountain coming because it was later in the year and the trees were in leaf so I could not see what was coming. My 4th trip up there so I knew what to expect - just difficult when you can see it ahead. The climb was like a long steep stairs and climbing (pulling) up over boulders. Thankfully it is short (about .3 miles) and I got there - stopping to catch my breath along the way. On top I climbed the tower and got pictures. Very exposed and raw windy conditions so I had a snack and left. The remainder of the day was more tame after that. I got to Rock Gap and then Wallace Gap was .6 miles further so I continued there where I was picked up by Ron Haven and his free shuttle to the Budget Inn in Franklin NC. So nice to get here and safe from the weather. Will take tomorrow off and possibly a short day Wednesday too if needed. There is some really cold weather coming and I must see how to schedule around that. Also have several things to do here regarding prescriptions. I'm warm, well fed and snug in a ""real bed"".

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556610,"I had hoped to take a 9:00 shuttle to Wallace Gap where I came off the trail the other day and hike the 3.1 miles to Winding Stair Gap to position myself where many of the hikers had gotten for the shuttle out when I move north. Talked with Ron Haven at the Budget Inn (owner) to learn a shuttle was already being set up for other hikers to Wayah Gap on Wayah road 5.9 miles further north. This allowed me to hike 9 miles today, starting at Wayah Gap (could not go further north because of road conditions) and hiking south back to Winding Stair Gap and then continuing on to Wallace Gap where I came off Monday. So it was set. I got up early and packed everything I would need to safely make this section in very cold weather. Based on the temperature in town we figured it was between 10 degrees and 15 degrees at the drop off point this morning. We left around 9:00 for the trip to Wayah Gap, slowed by school busses that were still out since school was delayed 2 hours due to the weather. We stopped at a nondescript spot in the road where the trail went north to climb Wayah Bald and south for the climb to Siler Bald and beyond to Winding Stair and Wallace Gaps. The shuttle drove off and I went south alone while the others went north. We were in a very deep, narrow place on the road where the trail climbs almost straight up on both sides, both directions. It was very cold and the trail was drifted with new snow but not deep in most places. This felt good since my pack was a little lighter. I did not bring my tent, stove or water filter. Just brought what I would need for the day's needs and safety if something happened. This pack weight would be so great everyday! I had about a 900' climb to top the ridge. The north side of the hill was cold and stark and the south side was brighter - both sides having a cold raw wind. My next section north will be to the top of Wayah Bald, so I took pictures of this huge climb from my position on the opposite mountain once I had gotten similarly high up on the south side on the way up to Siler Bald - Wayah will be a challenge once I head north again from here. I felt strong and made good steady progress. The cold became a non-issue once I hit my stride. The woods were beautiful. There were many views off to the massive snow-covered mountains in all directions. There were many streams. The snow was alternately deep and drifted or packed down and powdery, cold and crunchy. There were no recent footprints for several miles until I began to meet hikers who spent the night at Siler Bald shelter, coming my direction. After I passed the turnoff to that shelter, no footprints again. In this section the only footprints were made by what looked like a very large cat coming thru very recently. Just me following the cat. It would leave the trail for a few feet and then get back on and hike along. I began to create stories in my mind about ""hiker meets cat"" situations. The kicker came later when I looked ahead and saw a small trail sign (fairly common to note landmarks and locations along the way) and as I approached the sign it said PANTHER GAP. Great! Me and the cat and the cat is a hungry panther who hasn't eaten since before this snowstorm! I had a good laugh over that and how your mind works. Funny though, Marlene says I'm deaf (or selectively deaf  and with my hat on, my hood up and the wind blowing, and the trees snapping loud cracks with the cold, I started to look around since I realized I would not hear anyone (anything!!) coming up behind me. Fun, cheap entertainment for this lone hiker. I moved on to Swinging Lick Gap, Moore Creek and various other springs and streams, finally coming to the picturesque waterfall and footbridge at Winding Stair Gap - first part of the hike completed. From the bridge I dropped down to a major road crossing and then back up a high climb to a summit that seems to have no name. I saw 3 or 4 very beautiful overlooks once I got to the highest point and decided to name the mountain and those view points Marlene's Mountain. So now this area has a name - update your maps and guidebooks. Stopped to eat a quick lunch at a place where you could see far out into the mountain ranges, but was particularly beautiful if you looked straight down. The mountain side went directly down from my feet a very long way and with the gentlest curve outward to form a hugh cereal bowl looking cove very hidden from the rest of the world. When the trees have leaves this would be a very secluded and remote place down there where you could be and no one would know you were there at all. It was beautiful from there, just a perfect walk. As I began the steep descent down to Wallace Gap I entered an area that had forest fires in 2016. There had been recent trail maintenence in this area. The recent work had made a bare dirt treadway on the steep mountainside and where the trail had a southern exposure the dirt was slick, greasy mud. I slipped along down a very steep descent for about 3/4 mile but did not fall. I made it to Wallace Gap 5 minutes after the shuttle pulled into the gap. So I knocked out a quick 9 miles of progress and had a beautiful walk in cold but beautiful conditions. All the hikers were scrambling to make progress but also be safe with the cold temps and snow conditions, so I feel good about how it has gone. I will finish town chores tomorrow and head north on Friday. A little over 115 miles completed and very happy with how this part has turned out. I sent Marlene a few pictures and a video from today and we traded text messages. A good day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Wallace Gap - Franklin NC

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556642,"The grapevine tells me some of my cousins and others are concerned about whether I have adequate clothing and equipment to stand the cold. I did not take time before leaving to update the GEAR section of the journal site, so I will tell how it has been. First, I have a 20 degree sleeping bag (mummy type) which is down filled. I also have a silk sleeping bag liner which is similar to a large pillow case into which I slip my body and then get into the sleeping bag. I've heard they add between 5 and 10 degrees warmth but I'm not sure. If I don't get the silk liner pulled up just right I can tell immediately by feeling cold in the spot where it does not cover me. A very big help. Whether in a tent or shelter the sleeping bag is on an inflatible pad which is more comfortable for sleeping and also protects from the cold ground or the shelter floor - which sometimes can have cracks between boards like a deck does - cold and windy. If in my tent, the tent itself will give about 10 degrees of protection, and the tent sits on a piece of TYVEK (house wrap material) both to protect the tent from punctures and give another barrier between me and the cold ground. Clothing-wise, it's all about layering. I have several pairs of socks - both Darn Tough hiking socks and then nylon dress socks you could wear in dress shoes. I have one thick pair of hiking socks that I put on over regular Darn Tough's and only for sleeping. Boots always cause blisters so I am using Salamon trail runners (glorified tennis shoes). They have a very thin canvas-like toe box covering so my feet are wet at the slightest moisture - spit on my toe and it soaks through. To deal with this I bought SEAL-SKINZ which are a sock like product that is waterproof and breathable - a claim that almost never is true in an outdoor product. Normally if truly waterproof they do not breathe moisture out and you are wet from sweat. If truly breathable, then not waterproof and you are soaked. During the recent snowstorm and melting/freezing events my Salamon's were soaked all day. But I had regular Darn Tough's on with the SEAL-SKINZ on over them - SEAL-SKINZ up almost to my knees. Feet and inner socks were dry, shoes wet. Worked great. I was not hamnpered by cold or wet feet and the Salamons do not give me blisters or even a hot spot. I typically hike in hiking pants but can add silk-weight long underwear bottoms, which I have done during the recent weather. Carrying a pack is hard work so they become too hot quickly.   For uppers, I have matching silk-weight long sleeved T-shirt, short sleeve t-shirt, button up long sleeve shirt, insulated shell jacket, and a Frogg Toggs wind/rain jacket with a hood. All clothing is quick-dry wicking material - no cotton. I have three pairs of gloves from thick to thin and any two or all three can be layered together. For my head I have a ""stocking cap"" type piece - can't remember exact name of it but it covers my head and ears - special warm material. I also have a balaclava which is basicallly a sock for my head and face with an opening that can fit only my glasses, or expose my nose too, or go all the way below my chin. Have used it hiking only in the worst bitter cold high winds. Slept with it on once but it was a little bit of an overkill. I also have a baseball cap which shades my face in sunshine and helps keep rain off my glasses. So layering there too. Baseball cap only or it fits over the special insulated stocking cap, and the balaclava fits under both if needed. All of these items can be layered in any combination. If a morning is very cold I start with most of this on and quickly stop to shed layers. At night I have had to shed layers as well but less often. So far this has worked well and I have only been concerned a night or two in the worst exposed locations. But I have been acceptably comfortable. My main concerns have been a 6 - 7 day hike through Great Smoky Mountains National Park which climbs up to 5000 to 6000 + feet from Fontana Dam and stays there for 70 to 80 miles. That section is coming up in about 5 or 6 days and will be the ultimate test - warm weather ahead as spring approaches and the next place to worry is in New Hampshire. I'm fine and I hope this helps. So good to have friends who are concerned. Bye.PS - Progress: There are a couple of ways to measure it. First, I have over 115 miles hiked. Second, when I pull my belt tight the part hanging down is 2 inches longer than when I started.","Wayah Gap Road

Spoon Man was set to take Mountain Music and me up to Wayah Gap on Wayah road to start north. We loaded up our packs on the road and started out. I felt strong and even though Wayah Bald tower was 3 more mountains further than the one I had picked out, I did very well and got there fine. The trail has many miles of forest that was burned in 2016. Snow and ice covered the trail the whole way to the tower and tree trunks were charred black, obliterating any white blazes to guide the way. The tower area was particularly hit by the fire. I got pictures and then spent time to check in with Marlene and also see about a night in the bunkhouse at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) for Saturday night. Conditions were bleak with cold chilling high winds, and the contrast of the snow and charred black tree trunks and forest floor. I was glad to leave this exposed summit and move on. However, the next 6 miles to Cold Spring Shelter were a continuous uphill slog. When I finally got to the shelter it was packed. Everyone was talking about how hard the walk there had been with alternating frozen snow and ice, and slushy wet and slippery conditions where the sun could hit the trail. Snow at the shelter was extra deep. Campsites were buried beneath the snow, above the shelter on the exposed ridge. I decided to move on. Major locations were Tellico Gap and then a climb up to Wesser Bald and the fire tower on its summit. There were no good sites anywhere in this area. About a mile further is Wesser Bald shelter on a slick, muddy and slushy trail downhill the whole way. Only the next morning did I realize I had hiked 15.7 miles. Way more miles than I had planned to hike this early in the trip. The shelter was full long before I got there and many tents were set up. I found a site with a little more of a slant downhill than is best, scraped the snow and slush away and got my tent up. This was a slow process in the raw conditions. Filtered water and headed to the shelter to cook and eat under the overhang with the others. I ate 2 full meals - didn't want to carry it tomorrow. Hung my food on the bear cables and got into my tent and ready for sleep. It was cold and windy and the snow and slush began to stiffen. Finally I was in the my sleeping bag and very snug and cozy. Around 10:30 it began to rain hard with high winds. This continued all night but I was very comfortable. A long, hard day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Wayah Gap Road

It was still a mess since we were in the area of the forest fire and the ground was wet (mud) but the slushy stuff being gone was a big help. It was slow going to pack up and the tenters went to the shelter to have breakfast under the overhang roof. Soon I was ready to put on my pack and leave. It was 6 miles to the NOC for the day. I had a place in the base camp hostel and looked forward to real food, laundry, and resupply. Most of the day was downhill. A few small climbs and the really tough and sometimes technical descent over something called ""the Jumpoff"", where the trail lost altitude very quickly over some difficult near-cliffs. This was slow going and put a hurt on my legs and feet. The remainder of the day was just a long downward descent to the A. Rufus Morgan shelter where I met a husband/wife trail volunteer couple out checking the trail from NOC southward. Onward again for the final one mile hike to the NOC. Got my bunk and messed with gear, showered and then lunch at the River's End Restaurant. Then picked up my drop box for resupply and did laundry. Bunks are basic 2 x 4 and plywood bunk beds that you can use with sleeping bags and pads. No frills but much improved over the muddy hillside tent site. Appreciate the little things!!

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557744,"Woke early in my bunk and got ready to leave NOC. First went to the restaurant for a good breakfast and used the bathroom to clean up and get everything set. The NOC is a deep gorge between 2 mountains. Nantahala means something like land of the noonday sun because the gorge only receives sunshine when the sun is straight overhead. It is an uphill climb all the way to Sassafras Gap shelter where I had lunch. Great views all the way. Then another tough climb 1.2 miles from there to the summit of Cheoah Bald with even more awesome views of the surrounding mountains and all the way back down to the NOC and some beautiful rural villages. Distance today was 10.4 miles but very difficult 8.1 to the top of Cheoah Bald, with the remainder of the hike to Locust Cove Gap a steep downhill which was a welcome change from the climbs. Locust Cove Gap has a long narrow clearing where we set up about 20 tents virtually with inches between. It was a good group.

We all broke camp, ate breakfast, and left, mostly one at a time. The first 3+ miles had the usual ups and downs and was a pleasant hike to a major road crossing at Stecoah Gap. There were picnic tables and a place to offload our trash. I had a snack as other hikers came through. The next 3+ miles included something called ""Jacobs Ladder"" which is a very high series of succeeding knobs to climb one after the other with no letup. Just as you finally summit a knob the next one comes into view - straight up with no switchbacks to ease the climb. One of the toughest climbs so far. After that it was about a mile to Brushnel Knob where I found some of the others having lunch so I joined them. Then on to Cable Gap shelter with fairly mild hiking punctuated by a few climbs just to keep me honest. Most of us hike at our own pace so we enjoy hiking alone and then meet up at the site for the night. So I am at Cable Gap shelter where I have filtered water, eaten, and am nearly ready for the night. Tomorrow I will hike to Fontana Dam and catch a ride to Fontana Village and pick up resupply and spend the night. I have decided not to try to carry enough food to get through Great Smoky Mountain National Park - about 6 to 7 days, so we are working out plans to resupply in Gatlinburg and then again at Standing Bear Farm after I leave the park.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557131,"QUICK UPDATE - MAIN ENTRY FOR THIS DATE ADDED BELOWHi Friends,Just a quick update to let you know that I am ok and still moving along. I am in Fontana Village for the night, near the Fontana Dam. Tomorrow morning I will be entering Great Smoky Mountain National Park on the south end. I may be unable to update my journal for a few days, depending on how the trip through the park goes. I have decided to carry enough food to get to Newfound Gap and hitchhike into Gatlinburg, TN to resupply. I do not want to try and carry enough food to get through the park on this trip because of the weight, plus carrying winter clothing and equipment. My mileage now is 166 miles, despite what it temporarily says above. The park will take around 6 days (maybe 7 total) to get through, and I will spend the night in a hostel called Standing Bear Farm outside the park on the north end. After that it will take around 3 - 4 days to get to Hot Springs, NC and I may take a zero day there to get caught up on things, including my journal. There are many rules to follow hiking in the park, one of which is that you have to stay in a shelter, or tent beside it if full. They are unfortunately spaced at many points so it can determine the daily mileage and affect the total time through. Should be beautiful, but also can be difficult at 5000 to over 6000 feet elevation, and the winter weather to watch. I am doing fine and will update daily journal entries when I can, and will update this day's entry below this quick note when I have access to do it later. Thank you for following along and for signing my guest book. It really helps to read the encouraging entries from folks from all over. Watch for updates. MAIN ENTRY FOR THIS DATEI was motivated today to get packed up and leave since it was only 7.1 miles to Fontana Dam and then a night in town at Fontana Village. Also I had no phone reception last night so no chat with Marlene. I did not remember the HUGE climb out of the Cable Gap area and it caught most of the hikers off guard. No matter though - you just have to hike it as it cones. Once up top it was a long easy descent down to Fontana Lake at the marina crossing where I got a coke - the ranger I met there gave me 25 cents to make the $1.25 needed. After he took my picture I hiked the 1.2 miles to the Fontana Dam shelter (called the Hilton as it is very deluxe as shelters go) so I could stop in there and talk with the hikers and get pictures. Then I hiked about 1/2 mile to the Visitor Center (closed) so I could start out right at the Dam in the morning. The same ranger was at the Dam and he asked if I was going to the village. So that worked out well as I got a ride with no effort at all. Nice ranger and we talked on the way in - dropped me off right at the lodge door. As an aside, I had been thru this section before in a cloud and could not see the lake at all. I was right at the marina and did not see the shore. Today was beautiful as I saw the lake miles out and from above where the river backs up into the main body of the lake. The trail has also been rerouted to follow the lake shore over to the shelter, located from about 50 to 100 feet above the water. It was a beautiful day and very nice walk over there. I checked in, got my resupply box and got a shower. I did a little trail magic, giving away excess food to my friends as Marlene and I originally planned for a full resupply for the trip through the Smokys but I realized there was no way I would carry that much food and winter gear for a straight shot all the way through the park. I will resupply in Gatlinburg. I went to the Pit Stop for hot dogs for lunch (glorified gas station) and getting two breakfast biscuits to go for breakfast in the morning. Also drank two full sized Powerade's. Went to the General Store to look around and then back to the room to rest, relax, and repack. That evening I went to the lodge restaurant with some hikers and then sat in the dark on a small deck shared by the rooms in my section with several hikers I have gotten to know. We watched the thunder and lightning show from a strong storm in the high mountains we are climbing tomorrow. I'm so glad I'm not up there tonight but the fireworks were awesome. I'm packed and ready to go for the morning and settled in to enjoy a night in a real bed. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Cable Gap Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557854,"Today was a really good hike. I felt strong and ready. Got up, cleaned up one last time, ate my sausage biscuits and was ready for the 8 a.m. shuttle to the trail right at the south end of the Dam - you walk across, turn right and follow the trail beside a dead end paved road to the trailhead into the park 1.1 miles. I printed my thru hiker permit in Franklin, NC so I filled in the date, tore off the part for the rangers and dropped it in a metal box. I was off. There is a fire tower that looks tiny up on the Shuckstack ridge from below at the Dam, and the 4 1/2 mile climb to that tower is a real gut check. But I made it, climbed the tower and got pictures. On past Birch Spring Gap campsite to Doe Knob where northbound hikers go with one foot in Tennessee and one in North Carolina - through the park. So my third state is added to the mix. On to Ekaneetlee Gap where Dr Stretch was filtering water with his gravity system and offered to top off my bottles - was great! After that it was a long slog uphill to Mollies Ridge shelter but I did very well and felt strong. I had intended to stop for the night but I had time and was having a good day so I kept going 3.1 miles further to Russell Field shelter.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557877,"Well, I debated whether to explain the details of this day (and a few to follow, it turns out). After one of my other long section hikes a few years ago a friend asked me if they could really believe everything I wrote in my journal. My response was something like ""A lot of what I write in my journal is mostly true"". This description will be very true to the facts. If you have a delicate constitution you might want to skip ahead a few days. I had been hearing thru the trail grapevine that hikers were getting sick. Some of them were friends of mine and most were hiking in my group or a day or two ahead. They were all comparing notes on where they had camped, ate, gotten water, got food, etc, since Fontana Dam/Fontana Village. Yesterday, my first day out of Fontana, was one of my strongest hiking days so far - very encouraging. When I got to camp the discussion about sick hikers raged on and no one could come up with the cause. There were about 30 to 40 hikers that we knew who had gotten it but with many different experiences coming into Fontana, spending the day there, and coming north. About midnight I began to lose it on one end, and at sunrise I had to find a tree in the woods quickly so I could throw up my supper on the other end. People began to tell stories of staying in their tent for a day or two being too sick and weak to hike. There were people all around me - some sick, others not. Today everyone hiked on. I saw that Spence Field shelter was 2.8 miles away and I decided to try to hike there. As a side note, in Great Smoky Mountains National Park hikers are required to sleep in a shelter if not full or tent right next to a full shelter. Added to that the park has about 70 miles of the AT in it and a little over 40 miles of that is in the first section with no road out until Newfound Gap at Gatlinburg, Tennessee. So I was committed to get to Newfound Gap. Shelters can be unfortunately spaced apart so I decided to pick away at the miles as best I could. Spence Field shelter is only 2.8 miles ahead so I gave myself hours to make it. Honestly that is the hardest hike I have ever done in my life, including two years in the Marines and one of those in Vietnam. I would take 50 steps and then sit at the side of the trail for 10 minutes to recover. Very weak. If I ate I could not keep it in, but hiking is hard work and you need nourishment to sustain that much effort. Spence Field shelter finally came into view hours later. I went inside, got ready for the night and collapsed into my sleeping bag. About 6:30 that evening I heard someone say that they were going to check my pulse ( in jest). I was waking up then so I moved so they would know I was still alive. I slept about 5 hours like I had taken a knockout punch. So that was day one of this. If I'd known how hard that days hike would be I would not have done it. But then, with the potential to take days at that pace to get to the next road, I was happy for any progress. Add to that the inability to communicate with Marlene very well in the park I was concerned because we had talked about GSMNP being a big obstacle to get past this time of year. I didn't want to drop off the radar and have her wondering what was going on. So I pray tomorrow will be better. Thank you to any and all who are praying for me. I need God's strength.

Today began last night as for some reason my mind was very active and I hardly slept a wink all night. I was going over the plans for today's walk. 10.4 miles is normally a very simple hike but I was unsure with the climb to Clingman's Dome mixed in. The big climbs are the main concern with my weary and weak strength level. Then around 4:00 this morning a monsoon hit the shelter with drenching rain and high winds. So I was going over whether to stay put or go out later if the rain let up. The distance was probably at my limit so I could not wait long to start and still make it. The only place to stop along the way is Mount Collins shelter a few miles past Clingman's Dome but 1/2 mile downhill off the trail (with that climb in the morning too). The rain and wind made the shelter seem like trying to sleep in a popcorn popper. Under normal conditions I hike in the rain and hardly bother with trying to stay dry except for my face (glasses) and upper body if hypothermia is a possibility. In this hard driving rain I needed to be careful. I decided to go for it as originally planned to Newfound Gap, loaded up the pack and was off. The climb to Clingman's Dome started at 5510' and Clingman's is 6643'. The trail up was like walking up a creekbed - water coming at me from above the whole way. Rain was blown by the wind which also blew clouds across the path with near zero visibility at times. But it went very well - about 3 miles. I was encouraged. I went to the spiral concrete tower at the summit to get pictures of it, but there were no views of the mountains - as expected. About 7 1/2 miles to go. A long downhill from the dome with the water now coming at me from behind on the trail. Then a big climb up over Mount Collins and down the other side to the shelter side trail. Took much longer than I thought - so much longer that I assumed I had missed the side trail somehow. Disappointment when I found the side trail and saw my progress was slowed way down. Then another 4 1/2 miles to go with the usual mixture of terrain.  Again I was disappointed when I saw a paved road ahead, and found it was Road Prong trailhead with a small parking lot on the Clingman's Dome road (road closed until April 1). At first I thought it was Newfound gap and the parking area there, but there were almost 2 more miles to go. Marlene had passed the phone number of Kirk C. to me in a text message awhile back. Kirk had offered any help I might need in this area of the hike. I had tried to call Kirk from several high points all day with no success. I tried one more time at Road Prong Trail and got him. We arranged for Kirk to pick me up at Newfound Gap in a couple of hours. Kirk and Bev are friends of ours from Campus Crusade for Christ days back in Colorado and California, and had both been in the bridal party at our wedding. Great friends, and today I needed a friend badly. I actually got to Newfound Gap a little earlier than expected. I had to layer up again as the cold blowing rain chilled me right away once the work stopped. Kirk arrived at the bleak stormy gap and we got to their home in Sevierville TN in about 45 minutes. Great friends, and we are relaxing and watching March Madness, catching up where we left off the last time we were together. I will make plans tomorrow but I need some time off to get fully recovered and also resupply. In our little snips of time when we could get text messages through Marlene shared that many were aware of my situation and were praying for me. Thank you so much. Your prayers were answered today. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Double Springs Gap Shelter
",Newfound Gap - Gatlinburg TN,"Mar 26, Sun",10.40
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557939,"Today is Tuesday, March 28. I am in Gatlinburg TN to rest and resupply before heading back to Newfound Gap to continue north to finish the hike through GSMNP. I am feeling much better but have not yet decided whether to hike out tomorrow or rest another day. As I look back on it I have lost contact with most of the hikers I know so I don't have any further info about the bug we got or if it has sort of ended. I'm glad it's behind me. The hike was going well up out of Fontana Dam especially that first day. The views were very pretty and the weather was almost perfect. From that point until I hit the alpine zone at around 5000' elevation it was more of the same, just sort of set off by the circumstances of getting sick. When I got to the higher elevations the scenery was gorgeous and changed a lot. There were picturesque little coves and draws in the mountains with old fallen trees almost completely covered with bright green moss. The forest floor was very moist. This created little alcoves and forest neighborhoods. Colors were deep brown wood and leaves, green moss, forest green pines and all set off by the occasional ray of sunshine or the more likely misty foggy mysterious look of the fog and clouds. Really beautiful. Mountains had their tops cut off by clouds. When in the clouds at elevation there was no view to anything below and the trees, rocks and woods 20 feet away could be a surprise step by step. For myself I made mental notes to think clearly and take it a day at a time slow and steady. I can't help but think that cold March winter days will be a foggy memory come June with 90+ degree temps in the mid-Atlantic states and mosquitos all around. I never had fear for my ultimate safety or doubted that I would get to Newfound Gap. It was more of a long slog to the end and a real desire to just get there. I had lots of time to think. Since I started I heard of several friends who died. Some were very old and in poor health and not unexpected. A high school friend let me know of another high school buddy who died unexpectedly I think. This caused me to take a trip down memory lane. Though I have not lived in the area for years I remembered him as a good friend and a quick-witted gentle man, loving father and husband and all round a person anyone would like to know. He is gone at age 67. I have other friends who can barely walk across the room due to this or that condition. Here I am carrying a 35 lb pack up and down mountains for almost 2200 miles if I am able to finish. I do not feel that I have done anything to deserve good health nor have I done anything special to stay in shape. Nothing is guaranteed and I am just thankful for these blessings. Marlene and I have many friends from over the years. I mentioned Kirk and Bev C. who helped me with a ride from Newfound Gap and a place to clean up and rest. This was not convenient for them. Kirk and Bev are retired and take care of Kirk's mother who is over 101 years old. Bev recently had surgery on both feet and is in a recliner with her feet bandaged and propped up recuperating. When I called they were there for me despite all of this. Kirk picked me up and I was a mess if you can imagine my experience of the last few days happening in the woods. I came in, got a quick hug and was showering 10 minutes later. I ordered a pizza which Kirk and I picked up. I flopped onto the end of the couch opposite Bev. Kirk settled into his EZ chair with his mom seated in one next to him. We were all in stocking feet and slouching to relax and watch the basketball games. It was like we had done this every day for the last 40 years. Good friends are like that. Kirk and I went to Waffle House the next morning and gave the waitress a hard time. (She was more than able to give it back!). We went to the grocery store and I made ready. Dr appointments, etc, made it necessary for them to be tied up Tuesday so Kirk brought me back to Gatlinburg to a ""hiker friendly"" motel. My needs were met and we packed a lot of reminiscing over old times into the time we had together. Such a great experience and I am truly grateful to Kirk and Bev for taking me in. Great friends. I'm not sure of the plan yet. When I woke up at their house I realized I had slept very long and hard so that was good. But I also could still feel the deep exhaustion in my bones and muscles. I don't want to start again until I am strong. I look forward to 3+ more days hiking to exit GSMNP on the north end - a little over 30 miles to Standing Bear Farm hostel. Thanks to everybody who is encouraging me along the way. And the most special love for Marlene who is there every time I call or text, steady and strong, and helps me get through the next thing that comes. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Newfound Gap - Gatlinburg TN

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558589,"Back to work. After taking two days to recover and take care of town chores I was ready to hike today. I went to a restaurant in Gatlinburg at 7:00 a. m. and had a big breakfast. Back to the room to get everything and out to the main road (US 441) to hitchhike up to Newfound Gap. A few minutes later a former thru hiker (Calamity - her name is Jane) pulled over and I loaded my pack into her vehicle. She was doing a day hike and could relate to the hitchhiking hiker looking for a ride to the trail. Soon I was there, unloaded and ready to go. It began with a long but gradual climb which was just what I needed to see how it would go. 3.0 miles to Icewater Springs shelter over a rocky trail - I was happy with how I felt - stronger even than before. On to Charlie's Bunion for pictures. The Bunion is a series of odd outcroppings on the mountainside with straight cliffs hundreds of feet down. The day was clear and warm (high 70's) so I had good views. The trail traveled over long narrow ridgelines like a knife's edge. Many times the ridge was less than 5 feet wide on top - just enough room for the path. These ridges dropped straight off on both sides. Many areas had trees clinging precariously to either side. Some trees had fallen off and in other areas no tree or shrub could get a foothold. Not dangerous really, but pretty and interesting. I hiked strong the whole way (10.3 miles), with the usual fatigue as the afternoon wore on. I am at Peck's Corner shelter for the night, so far with 3 high school students hiking on spring break and two other thru hikers tenting. My strength seems fine. Tomorrow I plan a little over 12 miles. That will position me to exit GSMNP the third day. I will be so glad to have this part completed. It's beautiful but presents some problems when you are required to stay at trail shelter sites. So that's the plan. I am in a deep bowl-shaped valley down off the ridge and 1/2 mile off the trail so there is not phone reception. I will check in after I get going in the morning.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558591,"Up early and out early with a 1/2 mile climb back to the AT. I made a point not to know my exact location and not to be aware in detail of the elevation changes today. I felt strong, even on the climbs, and feel that I am over the ""bug"" and coming back stronger than before. Most of the way today was on very narrow ridges, literally only a few feet wide. There were great views at some points. I have to confess that my attitude today was to pound out day 2 of the 3 day push to exit the Smoky's, so it was a bit of a forced march. But I made the 12 1/2 miles to Cosby Knob shelter. The shelter is full and there are several tents also. It is a beautiful bowl-shaped shelter site, water from a spring right out front, bear cables to hang food so the critters don't get it, and a real privy. But the best part of today's hike is that I am in position to hike out of the northern boundary of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and about 3 miles further to the hostel at Standing Bear Farm. I will be glad for this milestone to be completed. Then on to Hot Springs, NC. No service and not much contact today. Likely not tomorrow either. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Peck's Corner Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558592,"I was up before 6:00 a. m. with a crowd of hikers all feeling the pull of exiting the park. It started to rain shortly after dark last night and we spent the night listening to the wind and rain pounding the shelter. No matter - I love that sound. I was up and packing and eating by headlamp, as were others. I was first out of camp shortly after 7:00 a. m. A quick mile downhill to Low Gap then a 3 mile climb to Mt Cammerer Trail intersection. No matter - I was stronger on the climbs today. Once atop Mt Cammerer it was a long descent to Davenport Gap and the northern boundary of GSMNP. I hiked in steady rain the entire way. But no matter. I did not wear any rain gear - just baseball cap, short sleeved T-shirt and regular hiking pants. Rain gear makes me sweat so much I am wet anyway. The wind was extremely strong yesterday all day and significantly less so today. The hiking kept me warm and I was on a mission. Finally I pulled into Davenport Gap shelter for a break, and one last easy mile to the northern boundary. Davenport Gap shelter seems so remote and deathly quiet. It tends to be skipped because everyone has just entered the park from the north or are really ready to leave if coming from the south. It was a beautiful quiet time to be alone for a few minutes and enjoy the absolute stillness and quiet of the area. A pretty setting. Right at the northern boundary I got about 60 seconds of sunshine. What a treat - ""Oh happy day..."". I met Not Bob there and he took my picture. No time to find out all the details but Not Bob was very sure to make me understand that he is NOT Bob, hence the name. So I pledged to tell every hiker I meet today that he is NOT Bob. But, nothing can stop me now! About 2 miles to go along state line branch - a stream forming the TN/NC border - and then across the Pigeon River bridge, under I-40 where I found Terry doing trail magic. He was talkative and we talked about his hiking adventures and his daughter's thru hike of a few years ago. He comes out whenever he can to show hikers a little kindness. I had a Subway sandwich and chips and about a 45 minute chat with him, sitting in a real chair and totally relaxed. Nice man. Finally I left and climbed the ridge. I hiked for about a mile to Standing Bear Farm. I have retrieved my resupply boxes from Marlene, done laundry, showered and eaten a pizza. Sitting here now with a group of hikers just talking and doing nothing. On toward Hot Springs tomorrow. Just in case you are wondering, I am so glad to be out of the Smokys. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Cosby Knob Shelter
",Standing Bear Farm,"Mar 31, Fri",10.60
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558595,"Well, Standing Bear Farm - how to describe it. The trail comes down off the ridge to cross a creek and comes up onto a remote gravel road. Turn left and go several hundred yards to this remote hostel. I heard the hostel ""trail boss"" talking with some hikers and telling them not to go further up that road since everybody who lives there knows you don't belong and are suspicious of strangers - possibly something to do with moonshine. I counted 3 creeks (at least) which come down various draws in the mountains and hit the main creek here, headed to the Pigeon River below on the south side of I-40. These creeks come right through the hostel ""yard"". A cabin has been built across one creek, and you can hear the water tumbling over rocks below all night. Another creek cuts through the main yard and has a rickety bridge for the shuttle van to cross and Maria the owner has her home there. A third creek skirts the bunkhouse. This creek's banks have been lined with stacked stones from the property, which have since grown over completely with bright green moss. Next to this creek is a tree house which you can rent as your accommodation for the night. I stayed in the bunkhouse. Twenty (+) double-decker bunk beds suitable for sleeping bags. I did my laundry using a washboard, then dried using a modern electric dryer which seems to drone on 24 x 7 as hikers keep it busy. The ""kitchen"" is a rustic building with the door always open on one side. It has a gas grill stove (?), a microwave, pizza oven (?), and a sink, all built into 2 x 4 and plywood cabinets. The walls are lined with bookshelves and various hiker pictures, brochures, maps, etc. related to the area and the trail from years gone by. An irregular shaped table has been constructed with seats all around, and the table also has about a dozen electric outlets suitable for charging phones. It is a come and go social center for the hostel. Out front there are rocks, logs and picnic type tables for sitting and lounging while engaging in hiker chit-chat. Various dogs are ever present, ready to play fetch with whomever will, constantly looking for a piece of food to fall or be given as a handout. There is a resupply store on the honor system. You settle up by presenting your list of purchases over your stay, plus the bunkhouse fee. All of this is directly overseen by ""Clark"", who directs the activities of whatever high school age employees and other laborers there are. Clark is a classic mountain man sporting a long white beard and uncut hair beneath a hoodie that he wears 24 x 7. All of this is owned by Maria, I think. Maria and Curtis built and owned the place for decades. Curtis died a few years ago of pancreatic cancer (I think), and he was a unique character as well. I stayed here in 2003 when Curtis was here. Clark is an interesting character. He appears nearly destitute, but I was up early to have breakfast in the kitchen with him and mentioned the books on the shelves. He says Maria buys them at garage sales for about $1.00 a box and keeps the good ones. Clark has read many of what would be called ""classics"" and can discuss authors and describe their writing style, themes, etc. He sleeps in the bunkhouse every night in his designated bunk. He really embodies the feel of this place.Today's hike went very well. I left Standing Bear Farm in the rain to begin a 2500 foot climb to Snowbird Mountain summit. Snowbird is bald and grassy on top with 50's style UFO-like communication equipment located there - I believe at least some of it having to do with the Atlanta airport. It was rain and fog all the way up and the towers were eerie in the mist. 4 x 4 posts with white blazes guided me across the open summit post by post in the limited sight distance. I got to the summit much faster than expected - almost 4 1/2 miles straight uphill. The original plan was about 10 miles total to a tent site. I began to think about Max Patch - a famous grassy bald - most notable one in the southern appalachians. Up and down between Snowbird and Max Patch but the latter is about 500 feet taller so ultimately a big climb to the top. I was strong today and got to Max Patch with 8-Track and Cousin Eddie - two hikers also at Standing Bear Farm overnight. Max Patch was covered with weekend hikers (I often forget what day it is) - there was even a wedding at the summit - ""the hills are alive, with the sound of music..."". It was clear and absolutely beautiful up there, a little windy. You get a 360 degree view back to the Smoky's and all around. The bald is huge. You feel like a flea crossing an acre of land. The next shelter is about 2 miles north so I decided to head there - Roaring Fork shelter, where I am set for the night. 8-Track stayed near Max Patch, and Cousin Eddie came here later after spending some time on Max Patch. Other hikers are in the shelter or tenting. It is a beautiful setting. I was able to text pictures to Marlene from Max Patch and we could chat via text. Seems she got jealous of me having a stomach bug, so she got one of her own. Hope she's getting over that! It was a really good day today. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Standing Bear Farm

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558602,"Another good day. I may have gone a little too far - sore feet and aching body but I'm recovering in Hot Springs, NC. Overnight at Roaring Fork shelter with a plan to stay tonight at Deer Park Mountain shelter about 3 1/2 miles outside of town - I thought that was ambitious. I was out early again and had several miles of easy hiking downhill until I finally hit the climb up Walnut Mountain. That climb was tough but I made it to the grassy open summit on a sunny Sunday morning. I love Sunday's because as I hike along I muse about what Marlene is doing during the morning and then to prepare for church, going through the service and the afternoon. Gives me a connection to look at my watch and think about what she is doing. Got a picture at the ancient shelter on Walnut Mountain - taken by Moose who over-nighted there. Was making good time. Started to think about going into Hot Springs tonight. Bluff Mountain was the major remaining hurdle I thought. It is a long tough climb and took a long time. After Bluff Mountain the way to Deer Park Mountain shelter is a bit of a heart-breaker, with several smaller but significant climbs that surprised me as I tend to write them off when compared to the big ones. Also, it was very hot today in the mostly bright sunshine - I got a little sunburn - minor. I had planned to continue to Hot Springs if I got to Deer Park Mountain shelter by 3:00 (later adjusted that to 3:30). When I got to the trail junction it was 3:01. So I continued on. A long climb up to the ridge on the sunny side, then finally a very long descent into town. You can see the buildings for about 2 miles but the way is long and gradual. Hiking for a long time gets you little perceptible progress (are we there yet?) to the valley floor - the buildings look the same distance away after all that work. But I made it, got a place for 2 nights and am fed, clean and resting my aching body on sort of a real bed in a No-Tell Motel type place - works for hikers. It's great to be here. Marlene and I had a long phone conversation to catch up. A good ending to the day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Sausage, eggs, coffee, toast, baked apples, and orange juice. Just what I needed for powering up the mountains today. Back to the room and out in a few minutes. Walked down the street in the early morning town waking up, crossed the French Broad River bridge and turned right along the north river bank for about a mile, right next to the fast flowing and wide river. A quick left turn and then the steep climb above the river and the town up Lover's Leap. A long hike with everything getting slowly smaller and then it was gone. The climb continued up and up, then finally coming to local backwoods roads and even a very old pond from an old dam probably built 100 years ago. Pretty setting in the remote woods. On to cross Mill Ridge then over US 25/70 on an overpass and the long, long climb up Rich Mountain (fire lookout tower closed). Beautiful hike from there on a warm afternoon to Spring Mountain Shelter. About 1/4 mile before the shelter I got a glimpse of a bear on a ridge to my right and slightly above me. The warm afternoon sunshine also brought out a snake, smallish and non-poisonous, but I know they are out if it gets warm enough so I'm keeping my eyes open for them. Decided it was too early to stop at the shelter and hiked on about 4 miles to Allen Gap and set up my tent along with two young guys - Boo Boo and Tootles. We built a fire and had a fun evening. We threw our ropes over tree branches to hang our food for defense against the bears - CBiscuit on his first try and the others through several episodes of tangles around the branch and 30 minutes later they had theirs hung too!!

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559209,"Today was a mixture of things. I started near the paved road at the campsite with Boo Boo and Tootles, two hikers who have been together for a few days but with seemingly different hiking styles and no commitment for hiking together long term. I was up before daylight to eat and pack up. I left to start a nice hike alone in the early morning woods. A couple of miles that were not remote and skirted private property as you could see driveways up into some hollow and sometimes a glimpse of the place, or hearing the roosters crowing and the hound dogs upset by some sound. There was a big climb up Camp Creek Bald and then down to Blackstack Cliffs. At Bearwallow Gap a sign presented a choice. Take the real AT or a ""bad weather bypass"" trail for the next 1 1/2 miles. The bypass sign said EXPOSED RIDGELINE TRAIL - ROCKY AND STRENUOUS. So everyone took the real AT (it turns out) to see the exposed ridgeline - Big Firescald Knob. Well we weren't disappointed. Bad weather likely could include ice and snow or lightening. We had very high winds with a few raindrops mixed in but not fully raining at that point. I did hear distant thunder but nothing close by, all the way through. Honestly, real hikers don't take the bypass very often. So, you turn a corner and start climbing stacked boulders up 20 - 30 feet, then back down the same. Twisting and turning up and down so I'm thinking this is kind of an exposed ridgeline but not too bad. There were high winds but kind of above me and they sounded strong and angry but not directly hitting me. Yet. As this went on I thought OK I can do this. But it turns out what I was doing was just getting to the exposed ridgeline. When I got to the real stuff I knew it. Suddenly naked exposed boulders and stacks of rocks. Sometimes I had to study them, even with white blazes painted on them to show the way, just to figure out how to go. Often they were completely exposed rock and other times there were bushes and brambles trying to get a foothold. The wind was like a hurricane force. I held my cap in my hand and braced for balance. I prayed for safety and made sure to get the right foot placements and not hurry. 1 1/2 miles is a long way in such conditions. Once or twice there were swirling raindrops mixed in and the thunder felt a little closer but it did not come near me. I saw no lightening flashes the whole way. The views off to the other ridges were beautiful in the gray, clouded-over light. The clouds were high clouds, not surrounding me with mist like in the Smokys - great colors. It was the talk of the hikers at the shelter tonight. I was tired when I got to Jerry Cabin shelter. I had hoped to hike on but the next shelter is 6.4 miles ahead. Our weather apps said the heavy rain should start right then and there were no tent sites shown until that shelter. I decided 6.4 miles was too far to start that time of day and the rest of the hikers decided likewise as they came in. I was trying to go further both to cover the distance to Erwin, TN over the next few days and to get a head start on tomorrow with a tough section coming up. But we take it as it comes. It seems that the weather forecast is about exactly 24 hours off. That makes planning hard. Hardly any phone reception so no contact with Marlene today. I wonder if that will be better tomorrow.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559213,"Up and out fairly early again (old guys do that) and a nice hike about 6 1/2 miles to Flint Mountain shelter - pretty bald grassy mountains to climb on the way and some big climbs but a good morning walk. Then more relatively easy hiking to Devil Fork Gap where paved NC 212 crosses. Then 1/2 mile more to another road crossing and the fun starts. I began a 1600 foot climb up a broad draw in the mountainside, soon coming to a beautiful stream with lots of water and the entire mountainside and stream bed littered with green moss covered logs and boulders. Up the left and cross the stream. Turn in the draw and up the right until time to cross the stream again. Very much elevation gain and more and more secluded little valleys in the mountainside (draws?) with each turn. I saw old twisted metal and thought about some old still, then saw next to it a flattened pile of ancient logs - set in a rectangular shape, like there had been a remote cabin there next to the stream many years ago. Once I saw it the site was clear - it was all decayed logs now with the bright green moss. Very remote - probably no road access ever. I stopped for lunch at a waterfall a few hundred feet higher elevation. If you know how a watershed works then you know that if you go high enough there is no water flow visible and you can detect a small flow coming out of the undisturbed leaves and forest floor. The last crossing of the stream was like that - just above the no-flow top of the streambed. Then the snow came and started to accumulate. All the forecasts said snow would come exactly one day later. I still had about 700 feet of climb. The snow became heavy and driven by the wind. The temperature dropped. It was a long, long, long slog to the shelter with several inches of wet heavy snow accumulating. There was some danger in this situation. I was 4th of 6 hikers to arrive and all of us struggled to set up for the night with numb fingers and toes and somewhat impaired judgment (misplacing gear, letting gear freeze that should not, etc.) All came in and got sleeping gear ready and got in to warm up first, then had something warm to eat and drink. Shelters are not windproof. The wind whipped the snow around us. During the night snow continued to accumulate. The wind caused several trees to fall in the vicinity. At first I thought it was thunder. I'll continue with tomorrows entry. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559217,"It became clear that yesterday's hike had exhausted all of us. Apparently these other hikers had a miserable night and woke up with wet sleeping bags, having little if any sleep the entire night. They could not get warm. For some reason my bag stayed fairly dry and I slept about normal, though when I woke up during the night the snow would swirl around me and hit my face (??). The snow had accumulated very deep overnight and was still falling. Older hikers have the reputation of being early risers. Red Goat (another retired hiker) got up as nature called about 5:45 and as is typical he began to prep for the day. There was a flyer in the shelter, placed there by a shuttle service, and it had a phone number to call. I called Red Goat to my end of the shelter and said we should see if anyone could get service and call for a shuttle to meet us at Sam's Gap - 2.4 miles ahead. I strongly urged that no one try to continue the hike north today because Big Bald is the mountain ahead - very high, exposed and only another shelter like this one on it's north flank. (I had been there in 2003). Others began to pop up and express interest in this plan. John Boat, from Minneapolis, got cell service and made arrangements but we had to be at Sam's Gap by 10:15 or he would leave - many hikers stranded in the mountains trying to get picked up to go into Erwin. Five hikers agreed to this plan. One young hiker said he was hiking north. Red Goat, me and John Boat formed an advance party and hiked out first to try and get to the gap and hold the shuttle. We were ready quickly. Tall Red Goat led the way with me second trying to help find blazes on snow covered tree trunks so we could navigate the trail, with John Boat a little slower in the rear - we kept tabs on each other to stay together. We hiked through snow drifts 3 feet deep and were concerned the snow was drifting so fast it was covering our tracks that the others intended to follow. (They did get lost once, for about 100 yards). It was a long strenuous and deliberate trek but we made it. In the gap the wind was sharp and cold but no new snow was falling at the lower elevation. But, Steve and Janet had trail magic set up - fruit (freezing), hot chocolate, candy, raisins, etc., We waited for the other 2 of our party of 5 to arrive about 45 minutes later. The shuttle was not there yet. After that the 6th young hiker came off the mountain, having changed his mind about hiking north and he also came into Erwin. So we are here. I am also taking tomorrow in town as I have to replace some gear that froze - water purification - up at the shelter. All of us have to dry out and re-group before going on.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559764,"4/09/17Up for continental breakfast at Super 8 and ready at 7:00 a. m. when the shuttle arrived to take me (and John Boat, it turns out) back to Sam's Gap to continue hiking north into Erwin finally. Started with a climb and then nice up and down hiking past many tent sites (many occupied) to Street Gap. Then began the 1800 foot climb to Big Bald. This was a tough climb - some of it just steep up and some steep up and over rock piles. Much of the snow had melted but many snow banks still remained and were enough to feed water onto the trail and cause the black dirt to be black greasy mud. Oh well just gave to get past it. I slipped and slided constantly but fortunately did not fall - I'd have been filthy. I finally turned a corner and could see Big Bald high above and far from me but with the unmistakable bald crown similar to Max Patch Bald. More piles of rocks to climb and finally the grassy edge of the bald and long line of 4 x 4 posts with white blazes, placed close enough together to be visible in fog. But I had warm and clear blue skies. I followed the posts up the huge crown of the mountain to the summit. Dropped my pack and took in the 360 degree view. I watched two hikers leave and go down into a dip and up to Big Stamp, a treeless saddle on the ridge. At a mile + away they were visible like bugs slowly moving away along the trail and finally out of sight over its crown. I left and followed finding more greasy mud - did not fall. A little over a mile to the turnoff to Bald Mountain shelter - not stopping but a good milestone marker. Many climbs and lots of streams to cross in the next few miles plus a very high steep rock pile called High Rocks - wasn't expecting that. Several more streams with pretty and picturesque bridges in thick rhododendron groves - like an air conditioner in the hot afternoon sun. When I got to Spivey Gap where US 19W crosses I met a hiker coming southbound. This man was one of those helpful souls who volunteered to tell me how difficult and long the next few miles were going to be for me since he had just hiked them easily going in the opposite direction. Typically advice and info from such a person is not accurate but his description was true. I'd rather not have known. I've heard it said that you don't help a man unless he asks for help. After the next few grueling miles I knew the shelter was about two miles ahead. Today was over 18 miles. I am here and ready for the night but more importantly I am well positioned with a little over 6 miles to finally really get to Erwin TN where I will resupply and then tackle the next section to Hampton TN and on to Damascus VA, a really great goal and milestone because I will have GA, NC and TN completed. I could not get phone service so was unable to update Marlene after the summit of Big Bald. The message I tried to send from the shelter last night failed (I found out next morning) so I resent it then. I like to have her know that I am in for the night when I can.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559587,"I was up early and ready to go by 7:15 from No Business Knob shelter as were many of the crowd who tented in the area last night - finally finishing the long run to Erwin on our minds. 6.2 miles can seem long but it was a beautiful morning and I was on the trail at first light but before sunrise. There were some pretty views off to the distant ridge lines and peaks and the light was such that hollows right above and below me on the side hill trail were gorgeous and sort of mysterious. In this section you hike about half way and then begin to get glimpses of Erwin on one side and the Nolichucky River and Clinchfield Railroad bridge coming through the gorge on the other from thousands of feet elevation. The long switchbacks back and forth across the mountain showed the town on one side and the river on the other until finally you see both as the river enters the town. Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel is right at the trailhead as it comes off the mountain. Finally into Erwin after all the weather related stuff. I got a bunk, showered and went on the midday shuttle to eat and start resupply. Then I took the supper time shuttle to finish at 5:30. I am set and ready to go out tomorrow. So glad the section to Erwin is complete. Goodnight Sweetheart.","No Business Knob Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560173,"Well, let me explain something and maybe introduce a little controversy. Today I hiked from Iron Mountain Gap back to Erwin TN. Normally most people would not notice just by reading my journal entry. However some people are known as ""purists"". They have very strict rules on how a hike should be done and will try to impose them on everyone they meet. So, I left Erwin TN this morning and had a shuttle take me out to Iron Mountain Gap and then I hiked back. In addition, I did not bring my stove or my tent since I would not need them for a single day's hike. This is called ""slackpacking"" by the purists as they look down their nose at you. I love this. I love to hike 20 miles north to south on my northbound (NOBO) hike and watch the faces of hiker friends I meet to see their reaction. Mostly nobody cares, and it is really fun to tweak the sensitivities of the purists. On a Georgia to Maine hike almost everybody hikes a few times southbound just because things work out better that way. Doing these 20.2 miles this way allows me to carry 4 days food instead of 5 once I leave Erwin for good on my way to Dennis Cove Road where I will resupply in Hampton TN. Five days of food taxes my strength still, with all the clothes I am carrying. This is a good plan for me. The hike today was still a tough one. I was on the trail at 7:30 feeling strong. There was a climb up Little Bald Knob and Cherry Gap shelter was about 3 miles in. The two main challenges for the day are Unaka Mountain (pronounced you-nake-ah) and Beauty Spot. These are both beautiful but different. Unaka Mountain is about 5200 feet elevation and has a crown of spruce trees that are not seen again until New Hampshire. Beauty Spot is another bald mountain with spectacular views in all directions, including a look down to the town of Erwin. The climb to Unaka is tough. The spruce trees at the summit are so thick that you hike into night - very dark. It is a beautiful effect. Then a steep rocky difficult trail down again and another big climb up to Beauty Spot. These were both beautiful. All the hikers had smiles on their faces as they had just seen one or the other of these locations, or were about to climb the next one ahead for them and were hearing the excitement of other hikers who were coming down from up there. The third obstacle for today was the long hot walk back to Erwin from Beauty Spot. There is lots of difficult rocky trail, some of it severely steep down hill over loose rocks and rhododendron roots. 20.2 miles is a long way. The reward for the last few miles is to come to the Nolichucky River that I had seen on the hike into Erwin the other day. The river comes through the gorge and the Clinchfield Railroad bridge crosses the river in the gorge, all of which I had seen from above on the far side of the river as I descended into town. Today I saw all of that part of the river in the gorge, plus the railroad bridge and the river rapids right up close as I came through. I was very tired and also glad to get back because there was a cookout scheduled with hot dogs, hamburgers, salad, etc. But I was also glad to have that part done and the remaining miles in this section to go over the next 4 days. The heat this afternoon was hard to handle - one of the few hot days since I started. The last 4 to 5 miles had me concerned that my body just might not be able to handle this. Tomorrow will tell as I load up 4 days of supplies and head out. I prayed to ask God to strengthen me because the hike today seemed to tax me to the limit.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560176,"The shuttle arrived at 6:45 and I was ready to go up to Iron Mountain Gap. A quick 25 minutes and I was standing beside the road in the early morning woods watching him drive off. The first part of the hike was a good mix of ups and downs and I was surprised at how good the pack felt especially on the climbs. It was fun to be out in the early morning and such a relief that the heavy pack seemed to feel great. I passed Clyde Smith shelter without stopping and quickly climbed Little Rock Knob. Then the real stuff begins. Roan Mountain is a legendary mountain to climb. It begins at Hughes Gap with a stark climb up it's little brother which seems to have no name and hikers say to me that once done with it the majority of the work is over. Ash Gap is a flatter spot between and then the climb up Roan Mountain really begins. I had done this before and the trail went straight up the mountain, climbing over Volkswagen-sized boulders. I talked with the shuttle guy and he told me they had reworked the trail and put in switchbacks, adding about 1 mile to this part of the trail. This was true - big rocky boulder-y switchbacks. Everybody was surprised by how hard the climb was - toughest so far on the whole trip. I actually remember the old trail as being easier - but that was 15 years ago (old guy memories)... Low on water I finally reached the summit - hot sun beating down and draining my strength. Such a great feeling to reach the top - the site of a hotel from bygone days. After drinking lots of water I began to think about my destination for the day. I had planned to stop at the shelter here on Roan Mountain (highest elevation shelter on the entire trail Georgia to Maine) - Roan High Knob Shelter. I recovered nicely after the climb and decided to go to Stan Murry shelter 5 + miles ahead. Part of the incentive was to go over Jane Bald and Grassy Ridge this afternoon in clear weather, and part was to position myself well to make this section in 4 days. So I started a long trek down to Carver Gap at the base of Roan Mountain on the north side, filtering water at a stream on the north flank. After Carver Gap, Jane Bald and Grassy Ridge are two huge bald mountains - not so famous for their height (though very high) but for their sight distance - you can see a long way with the trail stretched out ahead like a pencil line. It was very clear and beautiful. This is just a taste of what comes ahead tomorrow and I can't wait. If the weather stays clear tomorrow will be the best yet - the last time I came through here it was clouded in with no views. I'll hold off on that until then. I made it to Stan Murray shelter and we have about 10 here. A good group. We have finished eating and are ready for the night. I'm very happy with today's hike. Roan Mountain was hard but God gave me strength to do it with a full-weight pack. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Iron Mountain Gap
",Stan Murray Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",19.70
CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560215,"Today was the most beautiful scenery of the entire trip. I sent Marlene texts, photos, and videos as I had good phone service from all the highest elevations. (She said she was jealous when she saw them). I was up early and hiked the first couple of miles in the early morning woods to the Overmountain Shelter. This is a classic old red barn in a very remote location and it was converted to a hiker shelter - at Yellow Mountain Gap. I stopped to filter water at the spring. I think this barn has been used as scenery and location in a couple of movies and the Overmountain Men did a famous long march to help win a Revolutionary War battle. Lots of history. Back on the main trail I started into a beautiful section - Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain. For background, let me say that I had hiked through here in 2004 but with low hanging clouds and on Hump Mountain I was right in the clouds - 20 feet of sight distance. I recalled Little Hump Mountain, a dip between and then Hump Mountain itself. Today was completely clear with perfect distance viewing. However, I was mistaken by the details. After leaving Overmountain Shelter, I began a climb up what I thought was Little Hump Mountain. I recalled the trail being right out in the open on the grassy bald. But the trail spent a lot of time in trees at the edge, occasionally venturing out in the open, then back in the trees again. I will say that Little Hump Mountain is sort of a ""double hump"" but I did not know that from my previous trip. I climbed what I thought was Little Hump, saw a dip between, and then saw what I thought was Hump Mountain itself - looking distant, high and awesome. That lined up with what I knew from the previous hike. So when I reached the summit of the second mountain imagine my surprise to see off in the distance the huge summit of Hump Mountain above with its base and 3 1/2 miles of trail from my location up the flank to reach the top. All of this had been hidden the last time. I had climbed the whole thing totally surrounded by swirling clouds with near zero visibility. Today I saw the entire mountain in great clear detail. I was awestruck and could not wait to climb it. I came out of the trees and hiked about 50 feet to a large flat rock beside the trail and took off my pack. I got a few pictures and looked and looked. Three other hikers came by and helped by taking my picture. Then I watched as they started out, looking small after 5 minutes. After 10 minutes they looked tiny, having done about 10% of the climb. Above and beyond them were other single hikers or pairs spread out, with the tiniest little spec at what I thought was the top - a lone hiker up there. I mentally marked various landmarks along the way where hikers were located so I could remember how they looked from below when I reached their location. Then I started out. It was a very tough climb really, but I hardly noticed. The day was crystal clear. I'd hike awhile then stop and look back at my flat rock view point below and at my progress up the side. Over and over. The huge mountain flanks are mostly open and grassy. Along the way are areas of black boulders clustered together. These were massive as I approached each one. On the previous hike I did not even see these until I was standing in front of them 20 feet away. The highest boulder field looked like it was at the top from below. But as you near the summit there are 3 lines, called faults, successively higher, where huge slabs of bedrock tilted out of the mountain and up into the open air. These were not even visible from below as the summit rounded over and out of sight. I reached each of the three in turn and then saw the familiar line of 4 x 4 posts with white blazes denoting the trail over the curve of the summit and out of sight, coming into view one by one as I hiked along. Finally I saw a pile of rocks - a fire pit where brave hikers camped - right at the top of the summit. Celebration time!! At the several stopping points along the way up my flat rock viewpoint at the bottom was so small I had to strain to see it. The day was clear and the picture looking down was crystal clear. I was looking at a live view, but I thought of a digital picture, imagining the location of my flat rock below was a single pixel. Along the way I would see hikers emerge from the trees, approach my flat rock and then start the climb. Tiny and almost invisible. After staring for a long time from the summit I got so I could see the same thing - so miniscule I had to note the movement of the person to know they were there. So beautiful. There is one summit, sticking oddly up into the air and falling off steeply on the back of the mountain. The descent north is a series of shoulders and ridges, open and grassy. It takes a long time to reach the edge, successively lower, and enter the trees behind a split rail fence line. I hiked along taking pictures and videos all the way up, across the top, and down to the north edge and sending them to Marlene - great phone reception. As I left the summit I thought about what power God has to make such things, and how the whole earth is a mere grain of sand. When I left the summit and entered the trees there was normal trail until I reached the descent down the mountain directly below the highest point of the summit. The odd shape of that part of the mountain was due to large chunks of rock having broken off and rolled down, ages past, and forming a very rocky difficult trail all the way down to the bottom. I eventually came to an area called Doll Flats. This is a picturesque remote mountain farm with neat buildings, Christmas tree lots, and terraced land, possibly grapes (?). A little further I came to a park-like place but in a remote area - not like a town park - where I stopped for lunch, sitting on a huge smooth horizontally placed boulder. A small sign read LEAVING NORTH CAROLINA - signifying that I was in Tennessee and had completed North Carolina - second state down. I will be at the Tennessee/Virginia border in about 5 days. The remainder of the day I crossed footbridges over remote streams. I passed remote mountain churches and even more remote and very old cemeteries. Finally I dropped down to a very remote 100 foot tall waterfall (Jones Falls) and took a short side trail to see it. Then on to where the waterfall stream joined an even more remote section of the Elk River. New spring grass covered a bench-like formation above the river bank. There are 4 of us tenting here listening to the river and the song of the frogs and the owls calling off in the forest. Not sure why but I had good phone reception. Called Marlene from my tent at dark just to talk. The perfect ending to a great day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Stan Murray Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560632,Today's hike was fairly nondescript and especially when compared with yesterday's. The night by the Elk River was not the best for sleeping as the humidity by the river was heavy and it seemed either too hot or too cold all night. I woke with my tent as wet as if it had rained overnight. Up early and out early to hike a pretty section with lots of footbridges over remote streams. It was only 12.0 miles but the lack of sleep made that enough. Also I had hiked 57.4 miles over the previous three days so that may have caught up with me. I am positioned just right though with 6.3 miles to hike to a hostel near Hampton TN where I will spend tomorrow night and resupply in town for the four day hike to Damascus Virginia.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560763,"I love days like today. Short hike into civilization and looking forward to a shower, real food and a place to sleep. My early start got me into the woods at the time of the morning when the quiet trail sounds are there and the light is so pretty. 6.3 miles seems so short, so I have learned not to think of it going by in a flash because that anticipation has a way of making it feel slow and long - are we there yet? By mid morning I was at the road and turned left to walk 3/10 mile to the famous Kincora Hostel, run by Bob Peeples - a trail icon for many years. I will not elaborate on the details but I quickly decided to go elsewhere. I did not see Bob, but the hostel seemed a bit run down and less functional than I remembered. Sad to say, but it needs a little TLC. So I loaded up and walked 3/10 back to the trailhead and then beyond another 1/2 mile to Black Bear Resort. I got a bunk in the bunkhouse and it turned out I was the only one in the bunkhouse so it was like a large cabin at bunkhouse prices. I was able to resupply completely from their store, making that chore almost effortless. They had a signup sheet for a shuttle into Hampton TN at supper time so I put my name in and spent some time doing laundry and shooting the breeze with the other hikers. A lazy day. The only thing they need to improve on is the phone service - none in the area of the hostel - so no calls or wi-fi. As the afternoon wore on the lady in the store came to pose a question. Since I was the only hiker to sign up for the evening shuttle, would I mind skipping the trip to town and just coming to eat with her family there in their residence. It gets better. They had out of town family in but they have to leave right away on Easter Sunday morning, so they decided to have Easter Sunday dinner tonight. Would I like to join them? The best I could do in Hampton was McDonalds - so I took a long time but finally decided. When she called me to come I was ready. Turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing like my mom used to make, a ham, salad, rolls, cake, etc were forced upon me. I made up a plate and was seated with the family at the table. What a great time! I excused myself and waddled to my bunk room to rest. I spent the rest of the evening relaxing with the other hikers around, satisfied and completely ready to hike out in the morning. Beautiful Laurel Creek flows right through the property. I listened to it tumble over the rocky stream bed right outside my open window during the night. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Moreland Gap Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560764,"I was up and had breakfast of some microwavable stuff I had gotten the night before. Packed and ready I went out into the yard and the owner said to hold up a minute and he would take me the 1/2 mile down to the trailhead. So nice. There is nothing that seems more wasteful than hiking on pavement to the trail - miles that don't count. Today is Easter Sunday. It gave me a good chance to think about Jesus and the events we remember of the last 3 days. Overnight I awoke and could not sleep so I read the story in the gospel of John and it was a special kind of Easter service for me. Hikers were very open to talk about Easter and I found out there is interest in spiritual things - sometimes in people who seemed unlikely to be interested on the surface. Today's hike was so beautiful - and challenging. Funny that I had no phone service at all at the hostel and had great service on the trail today. I sent Marlene many videos and pictures. The day started on an easy trail beside Laurel Creek. Soon the creek enters Laurel Gorge with high steep rock walls - 100 feet high - and on an old railroad bed from days gone by as it meanders through the gorge. Steep cliffs with rock stair steps placed by the trail maintainers to climb and descend. Many remote and rustic footbridges and always the creek in view or hearing distance. I came upon Laurel Falls - about 30 feet high and very wide as the creek tumbles over the edge. You can hear the creek and the falls for a long way. In the deepest part of the gorge the trail is on a narrow ledge just above the water and along the walls straight up. Sort of a technical effort to get through and stay dry. This is very beautiful.   I took several pictures and videos and sent them to Marlene. The gorge widens out a little allowing the creek to meander. There were more footbridges in the beautiful little coves with very high mountains on both sides. The local trail continues on deeper into the gorge but the AT takes a right turn and abruptly begins the climb up Pond Mountain to Pond Flats near its summit. The elevation chart shows the ascent going almost straight up. It was a long 2+ mile climb, beautiful as the gorge disappeared below, the creek and waterfall noise grew more faint, and the mountain on the opposite side grew farther away as I climbed. Eventually I saw mountains behind the mountain on the opposite side as I gained elevation and could look over the top. When I cleared the shoulder of the mountain and the trail wound around to the other side it grew quiet as I could hear the waterfall far below no more. Still climbing until I reached another final summit and a creek up in Pond Flats where Einstein, his brother Little Cheese, and Cousin Eddie - a young woman from Texas, were stopped for a rest and snack. We had passed and re-passed each other all the way up. Then across the top and down to Watauga Lake where there are picnic tables on the beach. We had been hiking with 8-Track on and off over the last 150 miles. His wife has their RV parked at this location and was doing trail magic there - sandwiches and drinks and fruit. So that was great! I stopped for awhile but needed to move on. We had seen warnings on trees from the U. S. Forest Service about marauding bears in this area causing a restriction that we could hike the next 5 miles but with no stopping or camping in the area. The next shelter 3 miles ahead (Watauga Lake Shelter) is closed and I needed to get to Vandeventer shelter 7 miles further anyway to make the trip to Damascus Virginia work out with my food supply. It was 3 miles to the closed shelter, another mile to the dam which creates Watauga Lake and then begins the long climb up to Vandeventer shelter - on the ridge above the lake higher and higher all afternoon. This was hard work but the reward is to see the lake and its many points and bays as it backs up into the valleys between ridges behind the dam. Very pretty. I finally got here and am camped with a full shelter and many tents. It was a hard day. Also very pretty. It was fun to share lots of it with Marlene via pictures and videos. Happy Easter.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560772,"Up with the whip-poor-will this morning - a bird that has obviously still not found his true love and is pining away in the forest. I was ready and hiking before sunrise. I like that because the light is kind of mysterious, it's cool out, and I like to listen to things coming to life for the day. It was not a hard hiking day. The terrain was pretty tame, at least no huge climbs for miles and miles. About 6 miles in I came to Iron Mountain shelter, followed shortly by the Nick Grindstaff monument - a chimney-like memorial for a hermit who lived there. I think the story goes that as a young man in the 1800's he traveled out west and was robbed of all his money and belongings. Disillusioned, he came back to this very remote spot to live his life as a hermit. His memorial stone says ""he lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone."" Sad commentary, and good lesson on wasting a life. The next thing of note is at Tennessee highway 91 where the AT acquired a property with open farm fields all beautiful in new spring grass and views to the surrounding forest and mountains. I had seen it in 2004, just after they had purchased it. Still maintained pretty much as it was and a beautiful scene. The cloudy skies enhanced the colors of the early spring growth all around. At the road Mrs 8-Track (Cathy) was there again with their RV and doing more trail magic so I had a sandwich, chips, fruit, drinks - even a grilled cheese sandwich. So great to have a surprise of real food and it was exactly at lunch time for me. THANKS 8-TRACK AND MRS 8-TRACK!! My original goal was to reach Double Springs Shelter but I wanted to go further to shorten the next day into Damascus, Virginia.

I organized all my gear huddled inside my tent and then quickly got my bear bag, dodging tents that had been set up after I was inside for the night last evening. Back inside to eat some breakfast that did not require my stove. Everything was packed so I threw my pack outside and collapsed the tent, packed it up wet and was ready to go. Then it stopped raining. Good practice. Half a mile ahead I stopped to filter water for the day at a spring that was described as weak and muddy in the guidebook. Today it was strong and clear. In my mind I arranged today's walk into three segments. First, hike ahead to Abingdon Gap Shelter - 3+ miles. Then hike to the Tennessee/Virginia border - around 6 1/2 miles. Finally, hike into Damascus Virginia - 3 1/2 miles. Today's actual total is 13.3 miles and that can be a full days hike but not today - Damascus is a place with a lure for hikers and I wanted to get there. The terrain was relatively easy the whole way. Quickly I came to Abingdon Gap Shelter stopping long enough to chat with hikers there - all of whom had moving on to Damascus on their mind. Next up the hike to the border. It was a pretty section again enhanced by the cloudy wet weather making colors vivid, plus at this elevation the trees are prominently getting buds. Spring leaves will soon be here in full force. Flowering trees are in bloom all around. Sooner than expected I was at the TN/VA border sign. This is almost an emotional location. Three states - GA - NC - TN - are now officially completed. Your trip mileage is soon to approach 500 miles. Damascus lies 3 1/2 miles ahead - known as Trail Town USA. It hosts the annual Trail Days celebration where hikers from this years class and from all years past come together for a big party and gear show - around mid-May. It has the aura of being a major mental and physical milestone. But if you really like to see me cross state borders you better give it up for Lent, because Virginia has 544 miles of trail. I'll more than double my current mileage before I cross a border again into West Virginia. There is no fanfare. You come around a small curve and a little downhill to see a simple sign marking the border - totally in the middle of nowhere. There is a line of rocks across the trail to the foot of the signpost. I got pictures and called Marlene. We started a tradition on our honeymoon almost 41 years ago that we kiss when we cross state lines. I sat on a rock with my back against the post and one foot in each state, and called to get my kiss. Two other hikers came by and we took pictures for each and then we were off to Damascus. Laurel Creek and Beaver Dam Creek come together in Damascus. As is typical the trail descends to that lower elevation as you approach town. Soon I began to see the outskirts - more remote homes on the edge in the valley below. Down, down, down and closer as the homes began to take on the shape of a town - streets laid out and the order of civilization. You come down off the mountain as the trail enters someone's back yard and then walk across their front yard to the street. The trail enters a long narrow park and follows it to cross bridges over the creeks and right down main street with white blazes and AT markings on the sidewalk. You are welcomed to Damascus kind of like someone special. Damascus is a pretty little mountain town. The creeks and bridges are beautiful. Very old homes with interesting architecture. So green and beautiful with the trees budding and blooming and the mountains rising all around. I got a place to stay, cleaned up and ate real food. I have some medical things to take care of regarding prescriptions so I may be here a couple of days. But I am so happy to be here and to have made it this far.

Real food is available. People know you are a hiker and want to be helpful. All my chores were done so I was up early, packed and down at Mojo's Coffeehouse before their 7:00 opening so I could get a good breakfast send off. Not disappointed. The day was wet and humid and closely overcast. I took the AT out of town on a flat tourist path then crossed the road, climbed a high set of stairs onto the mountain to be swallowed up by the forest. So much for town. A good climb to get started but I did well - rest always helps. Rain threatened all the way starting and stopping as I went. Then another climb up to Saunders shelter and the rain began steady and in earnest. Much of the hike followed Laurel Creek up the mountain with the AT on one side and the local Virginia Creeper Trail on the other side - both visible from each other much of the time. I saw runners and bicycle riders on the Creeper trail with the beautiful Creek tumbling over boulders between. The AT and Creeper trails come together to cross the Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge - a very long footbridge built on the railroad trestle from yesteryear. It was a very pretty setting. Finally to the Lost Mountain Shelter for the night and I set up my tent in the rain on and off, with more rain expected overnight. Rain and lack of phone service kept me from texting Marlene so sort of feeling disconnected tonight. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Damascus, Virginia

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561544,"Rain all night and during the pack up time this morning. Rained all day. From Lost Mountain Shelter is a huge climb up to Whitetop Mountain. Whitetop is a large open bald mountain which reminds me of the balds further south, but also gives a preview of the Grayson Highlands to come later today. It was raining with a sharp cold wind. This was a gorgeous scene and again enhanced colors by the wet and cloudy conditions. The high point is Buzzard Rock - stark and bold at the summit. After crossing Whitetop I descended to Elk Garden, a very garden-like road crossing. South of my location about one day's hike is a hiker named Walkman - I have not met him. His parents visited him in Damascus and then came here to Elk Garden, set up a tent and are doing trail magic - so another unplanned but great opportunity to have real food, treats and soft drinks. That was great. Cross the road and climb a hump covered in open pasture land with new spring grass to begin the climb up to Mount Rogers - the highest peak in Virginia on the trail. Rain was falling the whole way on the huge climb up to Thomas Knob Shelter after the side trail to Mt Rogers summit (nothing really to see there). After Thomas Knob Shelter you enter the Grayson Highlands which is home to herds of small ponies. The rain grew intense. The trail through the highlands is very rocky and exposed and a virtual stream bed from all the water. We all finally just stomped on through - no chance to keep anything dry. Saw the ponies and the beautiful scenery of the highlands but was somewhat overwhelmed by the stark and nasty conditions. By the way, ponies leave piles of pony pooh and at the proper location a hiker arranged the required little balls of it into ""500 Miles"" to commemorate the milestone. Hiker humor on an otherwise humorless day. Finally made it to Wise Shelter where I took a space inside. This being the weekend there were dozens of weekend hikers - boys scout troops etc. There were probably 50 - 60 people there - still in cold rainy conditions. Tents were set up everywhere and activities for the evening were pretty limited. Rain day and night taking its toll on our outlook - we want it to stop!! No communication today at all.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562795,"The plan today was to hike 20+ miles to Trimpi Shelter - everyone at Wise Shelter was up early to get started. The rain and wind held steady overnight. Everything was a sloppy wet mess. All creeks and small streams virtually at flood stage. The trail went through ponds of water. No effort was made to keep my feet dry. All clothing I was wearing was wet through. The pack itself and all the contents was completely soaked. The first landmark is a place called The Scales - literally a place where cattle were weighed in bygone days. It is a pretty area and I had seen it in the past in nice weather. Today I could not see across the corral from gate to gate to pass through because of thick fog and very heavy rain. The trail was confusing and very difficult to follow across many regular streams and wet- weather creeks. The Old Orchard Shelter finally came into view and I took a break to eat and rest briefly. A little further on I came to Hurricane Mountain Shelter. In 2004 when I came through I saw the shelter site prepared and when I came to the road ahead I saw a truck loaded with lumber and the driver said it was for the new shelter. I decided to go there and see it. Several hikers were there hunkered down in sleeping bags to fight off hypothermia. There were strong winds and driving cold rain. I could tell the temperature was dropping. I had a snack and loaded up to leave. Five miles ahead is a beautiful Creek called Comers Creek with a footbridge and multiple high cascading waterfalls.  I had also seen this in 2004 but it was just a trickle. Today it was a wild aggressive stream of runoff water blasting loudly through the streambed from the draw in the mountain above, bubbling and foaming over the car-sized builders. It could be heard from way off. I had been passing, and being passed by Scotty, a 50-ish hiker from England that I have been hiking around for some time now. Shortly after Comers Creek I passed him again. About a half mile ahead the trail crosses the intersection of Virginia highways 16 and 650. Conditions could not have been more miserable. Scotty remarked as I passed that if someone offered a ride at the road he'd take them up on it and go into town to dry out.  When I got to the road there was some traffic so I thought it over. When Scotty came up we decided to give it a try. A couple of minutes later two more hikers came up onto the road and I have never seen two more miserable looking hikers. We four decided to hitch into town. There were a few vehicles that slowed down but kept going. Finally a lady and man from Pennsylvania who are hikers themselves pulled over in a pickup truck. No room inside but we could ride in back. The bed was level full with tires and storage boxes but we four, plus our packs and trekking poles got into the exposed bed and hung on for dear life as they drove the curvy mountain road for about 20 - 25 miles. We were completely inundated with driving rain and the wind chill of 55 miles per hour. Finally we pulled up to the Econo Lodge in Marion, Virginia. There was no warmth left in any if us. Scotty and I got a room together. Even after hot showers we were both still shivering. Turns out that many hikers were coming down from the mountains and those who kept going to the shelter describe miserable conditions setting up tents in puddles of water and the harsh driving rain. My plan had been to hike one more day ahead and then hitchike to Marion  Virginia. So I am taking my day off one day early and will go back out and hike ahead from there - same plan but just traded days. The rivers and creeks in and around Marion are at flood stage. The forecast is for more of the same, but you can't hold up forever and make it to Maine. I am resupplied and have a shuttle scheduled for tomorrow morning.  I have updated Marlene on what happened and the new plan. So good to make contact and let her know I'm alright.

I was mostly packed and ready to go to Hardee's for breakfast at 6:30. Then I had a 1 mile hike on a paved edge-of-town narrow road to get me back to the place where the trail came down off the mountain from Angel's Rest the other day. The hike began by finishing the descent from Angel's Rest to the low spot of the bridge over the New River. It was like remote hiking except for the section crossing the original cemetery where the first settlers of Pearisburg are buried. Then a turning and twisting route across and under the Senator Shumate Bridge to get me over the river and the railroad tracks, followed by a winding route to the Celanese Plant on the edge of town. Finally leaving the influence of town I began a 6 mile climb up to the ridge I had been seeing to the north during my stay. The tiny power line towers and communication towers came into view as I reached their locations on the long broad ridge. The climb is a good mixture of steep and more gradual terrain, with plenty of rocks. The sky is cloudy with rain expected the next three days. It has been very windy all day - especially up on this exposed ridge. Finally topping the ridge at Rice Field, an open grassy spot, I came to Rice Field Shelter and stopped for an early lunch. I got pictures of the shelter and Rice Field (and videos) with a view north to a pretty valley that I think is in West Virginia - I am hiking parallel with the Virginia/West Virginia border right now - sent them all to Marlene.

I awoke at 5:00 and started to pack up and get ready. As daylight came I could see dark high clouds, but also some clear spots between. The rain stopped as I broke camp but the wind was bringing drops down from the trees. Soon the cloud cover thickened and the ridge top was a misty gray with limited sight distance. I had a rocky three miles along the ridge and then a steep drop three miles to the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter site. The shelter is closed due to many standing dead trees which present a hazard until they can be removed. The trees were killed by some kind of bug. Hiking along this morning I saw one hiker briefly. He was on a short hike on one of the local side trails. After this I hiked for two miles along Stony Creek, again seeing no one except a fly fisherman who was standing in the wide swift flowing creek casting. He did not see me up high above on the trail. Crossing the footbridge and the the gravel road I began a long difficult climb up to Bailey Gap Shelter where I ate lunch alone. After lunch I had a seven mile hike on the ridge top. It was a rock pile the whole way. At Wind Rock is a beautiful panoramic view of the valley below so I got pictures and videos but could not send due to no phone service - very remote here. There were several more miles of ridge top to hike plus the descent to War Spur Shelter. Along the path I met another hiker on a short hike and he complained about the boring path through the woods. I was enjoying it because there were no rocks in this section. I wonder how he liked the section ahead with the same woods but a virtual rock pile the whole way. I finally arrived here at War Spur Shelter around 6:00 and got set for the night - camped alone. Most of the hikers I know are either a day or two ahead  or behind as our zero days did not match up or due to foot injuries. I am great company, but it is nice to have other hikers in camp at night, and I am feeling alone. I can hear the creek below, and the birds are singing their end-of-day songs as the sun has gone behind the ridge to the west. It will begin to get dark soon. The camp seems so empty with no one else in the shelter and no tents set up. I enjoy that but have had two full days alone.

It had rained overnight but I was dry under the shelter roof and that made it easier. I had a 1 mile trek following Johns Creek the rest of the way down the mountain. Then began a 2000 foot climb up John's Creek Mountain and Kelly Knob. I was strong and the climb went well. Down to Laurel Creek Shelter and a lot of local pasture land and pretty forests. I sent some of my cold weather gear home from Pearisburg. Rule of thumb is send it any time after Mount Rogers, a couple of days out of Damascus, Virginia - well over 100 miles back. On Johns Creek Mountain and Kelly Knob I was in a snowfall - big wet sloppy flakes. It did not accumulate but I put on what layers I had and still got numb fingers. Dropping down about 1800 feet the temperature was more friendly. Today's real challenge was to get to Virginia highway 42, a remote country road, and get a ride into Newport, Va. to resupply at a small store. I prayed a specific prayer to ask God to make this work out. About 1/4 mile down the road I could hear what sounded like an auction going on. A few cars passed and then I saw a vehicle slow down - going the wrong direction. They went down about 300 yards and turned around to come back and ask if I needed a ride. It was a young woman driving, and her mother, and they had been at the estate sale up the road. They offered to take me 8 miles to the tiny town of Newport, wait while I shopped and bring me back. God answered my prayer perfectly. I was able to get food for the section to Daleville, Va. and got hot dogs and a Gatorade for lunch. They were very nice folks and asked me lots of questions about me and my hike. It could not have worked out better. I was prepared to take most of the afternoon to handle it but it took about an hour. Back to the trail, crossing some private land of farms in the beautiful Virginia valley. I passed the Keffer Oak, largest oak tree on the AT in the south - 18 feet around and over 300 years old - second only to the Dover Oak in New York. After that I had a 1500 foot climb up Sinking Creek Mountain, originally planning to stop at Sarver Hollow Shelter. This shelter sits 4/10 mile down off the ridge and 200 feet elevation loss, which I would have to climb back up in the morning. Since the resupply went so well I decided to hike a few more miles. I found a small spot to set up my tent. After getting everything ready and getting inside it started to rain. I am snug and dry and ready for the night.

It was cold overnight but warmed up again toward morning. Funny how sensitive I am to being too hot or cold in my sleeping bag. Sinking  Creek Mountain is a miles long ridge line. Below is a long valley that is very wide and bounded by an equally long and high ridge line on the other side. I'll be over there today. Rugged rocky outcrops along the remainder of the ridge and then a 2000 foot drop to the Niday Shelter and on to Craig Creek and Virginia highway 621. Crossing, I began two miles of creeks and footbridges and started to climb Brush Mountain - the ridge on the other side of the valley. It was so beautiful to see the valley and the ridge from yesterday spread out as I went up, so encouraging to see that massive mountain and valley marking my progress through Virginia.  Then a steady climb on good trail and graded switchbacks up to the location of the Audie Murphy Memorial.  As an aside, Audie Murphy was the most decorated American soldier from WWII. He died in a plane crash on that ridge in the 1970's.  A large stone monument has been placed there. Over time people have honored him by stacking their own small piece of stone around the monument. Probably most have been placed by hikers as the place is remote and difficult to reach. There are many thousands of small flat stones stacked there, along with dog tags, MIA Bracelets, Wounded Warrior Project Bracelets, rank insignias, various military medals, small flags, pictures of soldiers,  among other memories of soldiers and their families. The place has a quiet and sacred feel and causes you to reflect on our heritage. A beautiful place seen by comparatively few. I sent pictures and a video to Marlene so hopefully it will be helpful to explain the dignity of this place. I went ahead across the long ridge again today, then a descent 1700 feet to Virginia highway 620, a gravel road, and Trout Creek, again with many local creeks and footbridges. I passed by Pickle Branch Shelter and decided to hike ahead a couple of miles and the Lord provided me a 1-tent site where I am set up again much the same as last night.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563988,"Big day planned. Started at the tent site before sunrise - no rain overnight so I had an easy time. My tent site was about three miles south of Dragon's Tooth, a series of stone monoliths - broken bedrock tilted up into the air on the spine of the ridge at the farthest and highest point. I was excited to see it, so the tough hike over smaller stone monoliths to get there was not able to dampen my enthusiasm. So far Virginia is about three things - long high ridge lines, beautiful valleys in between, and creeks through picturesque forest creating quiet dark settings. The Dragon's Tooth ridge line is rugged and gets more rugged as you go, and the valley off its steep side is too beautiful for words - I'll cross it later today. I took the short side trail to Dragon's Tooth and got pictures and videos to send to Marlene. Off in an open grassy field at the farthest edge of the valley in the distance I could see a faint pencil line curving across the open space to the forest at the far edge as it started up the steep mountain over there. I wondered if that could be the trail. (Later in the day as I crossed that field on that very line, like a half mile long in the open grass, I turned and looked back across the wide valley at Cove Mountain and saw the Dragon's teeth like a thin line of stone at the sky line of the mountain - so cool to see from both perspectives).  Then a very technical descent down the cliff face (literally). I would study the way to go and carefully place my feet for each step. Narrow ledges - the width of one shoe - in a puzzle-like fashion to figure the way to the next one and on down the cliff. Several places had metal rungs drilled into the rock face to use as a ladder. It was fun, but I had to forget about speed and concentrate on accuracy. A couple of miles later I hit Virginia highway 624 where there is a half mile walk to Catawba Grocery, known to be hiker-friendly. I went there for a real-food lunch - a huge cheeseburger, fries, Gatorade, and double scoop ice cream cone - not once worrying about the calories. Yummy!!  I tried to hitch back to the trailhead but had to walk - worth it though. Next about six miles of creeks, footbridges and ups and downs on rocky trail to Virginia highway 311. Then began the climb up to the iconic McAfee Knob. One mile to John's Spring Shelter, one mile to Catawba Mountain Shelter and then anticipating the final climb to the knob. This was a rocky climb. I should know better than to ask other hikers, especially local hikers, ""how close am I?"".  Thinking I was close I asked and they said only 1/4 mile. I hiked a half mile and the next one said about 3/4 mile. Finally I arrived as most visitors for the day were leaving to find shelter or get back down to their car. Four young women were still there and took pictures for me. This is an iconic trail location.  A huge chunk of rock juts out into the open air from the cliff and every hiker gets their picture taken with their legs dangling over the edge (you have to, else you're not a real hiker).  I got great late-afternoon pictures and videos and sent them to Marlene - apparently my sanity is in question for the leg dangling pose. The wind was very strong so I did not get as close to the edge as some do. Day was ending so I hurried to Campbell Shelter, about a mile ahead and set up for the night. There were several hikers in the shelter and tents set up also - I enjoyed the company after four nights completely alone.  So, two famous iconic AT locations in one day. One more to follow tomorrow - Tinker's Cliffs. Lots of fun to see them and share. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Campsite on Cove Mountain

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563997,"Another special day. In 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 I did four long section hikes beginning in Georgia at Springer Mountain on the southern end of the AT and hiked the next section each year, finishing in 2005 at Daleville, Virginia - 728.1 miles. Today I will hike into Daleville and spend the night. Really excited about getting here and now I have not seen any of the AT north of this location. Another iconic location today too - Tinkers Cliffs. The pictures and videos from yesterday on McAfees Knob show a high point across the valley with a very thin line of stone showing along the crest. My first assignment today is to hike along a series of knobs forming a ridge line from McAfees Knob to those cliffs, and I will take pictures and videos from there looking back. Between them a beautiful Virginia valley, which I will hike along and above all day today, finally ending in Daleville, Virginia way down the valley fifteen miles. I was up and getting ready as the sun was a faint red glow on the horizon looking through the tree trunks in the dark woods. From McAfees Knob you can see the route over to Tinker's Cliffs, almost exactly five miles. It is a series of knobs with gaps between, all the while going progressively higher until cresting the cliffs at about the same elevation as McAfees Knob. Tinker's Cliffs are essentially a half mile of stone blocks (huge) that the AT runs along. The trail pretty much hugs the edge within three feet the whole way and there many points where you can stand and get a panoramic view of the valley. I sent pictures and videos to Marlene, trying to narrate what I saw. It is beautiful in the morning cloudy light. After that I went down the back side of the mountain from Tinker's Cliffs to the Lamberts Meadow Shelter for a snack and to filter water. Then a climb up a rugged ridge further down from Tinker's Cliffs and all the way into town. I have a room at the same hiker hotel as in 2005. Lots of memories. Lord willing I will resupply and go forward from here into new territory. By the way, yesterday at Dragon's Tooth I passed the 700 mile mark. Progress. I'm excited to go forward from here.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564479,"Started out at the Howard Johnson hiker hotel in Daleville, Va.  Had continental breakfast and then leftover pizza in my room to get as much nutrition going as I could. Today when I leave town I am in new territory because I had hiked every mile from Springer Mountain in Georgia to here in Daleville in the past so now everything I see will be new. Expecting to take my life into my hands, I headed for US 220 to cross and didn't even slow down as traffic formed a gap in both directions.  Into the woods on the far side and I'm on my way. There was some city but mostly the hike was in the woods to get to a bridge to cross I-81, followed by the same to cross railroad tracks and US 11 and some private land and finally I started climbing mountains and crossing streams on footbridges.  Five miles in I stopped at Fullhardt Knob Shelter for a break.  Six miles ahead I did the same at Wilson Creek Shelter. Ahead I began to cross the Blue Ridge Parkway and several of the scenic overlooks. I thought this would be fun and I was looking forward to it. Funny though, it seemed like the AT was either following the BRP road ditch or was being routed to bring the trail to a BRP turnout overlook. But we were seeing plenty of beautiful views along the trail before so this seemed unnecessary.  I was glad to leave the BRP.  The day finally ended at Bobblets Gap Shelter. It had been raining or threatening rain all day. The shelter was packed and the heavy rain made us huddle inside. So the day was a success to hike ahead into new territory but there was little to see in the fog and rain.  Glad to be going forward again. Miss it when there is no chance to text or talk with Marlene. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Daleville, Virginia

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564499,"Sort of a miserable night at Bobblets Gap Shelter as we were packed in and the rain was heavy all night. I was ready to pack up well before daylight and so were some others so we began to stir and start the day. There were more Blue Ridge Parkway crossings early on but it was cloudy and raining with fog pretty much all day so I did not go out of my way to see the views. It was a fairly easy day with no killer climbs except for Fork Mountain near the end of the day.  I am at Bryant Ridge Shelter for the night after a relatively short 13.5 mile day but that was enough for me. This shelter is probably the best one I have been in so far. It sleeps 20 and has a lower level and a loft and also large and spacious covered sitting and cooking areas. So much different than last night. This middle part of Virginia is a little strange somehow.  I think it is because the entire hike north from Daleville has been in a fog and rain so there is nothing to see. When I compare that to the last 50 or so miles with all the iconic view spots it pales by comparison. Also the Virginia ridges and valleys have spoiled me because everything as been so beautiful.  Oh well, have to take the rain and sunshine as it comes. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564502,"This has been a long but good day. Up early and out early for a challenging start. There was much discussion of the climbs last night as we will be going uphill for over nine miles and several thousand feet of elevation gain. It was a mixture of cloudy and rainy with also some sunshine especially this afternoon and I saw several beautiful valley views. The climbs did not disappoint but the nine miles straight up went well, I think because we were so ready for them. It broke down into three major climbs each one successively higher from the ending elevation of the last one with no break to speak of. Cornelius Creek Shelter and Thunder Hill Shelter were spaced between sections providing a place to filter water at one and a lunch stop at the other. Just before lunch I was hiking with Solomon and we came to The Guillotine. It is a place with two massive pieces of stone about 20 feet high and sitting about 4 feet apart. Suspended in the gap is a large rock, guessing maybe 5000 pounds. The trail is routed between the large stones and you walk under the one suspended above - thus the name. Funny to think how that stone got set in there.  I got pictures but was unable to send them yet. Another iconic trail location. The last climb kind of standing alone was High Cock Knob. I saw it coming. It is a stand alone very sharp-topped mountain. That sharp top was almost a straight up climb but it felt so good to mount the summit and then it was an easy mile of downhill to this tent site at Marble Spring. I am set up and ready for the night. I am looking forward to a night in my tent. Hopefully it won't rain and it is so nice to have room in my tent to myself sometimes. Marlene and I were able to trade text messages today (but not pictures) so that was nice. Always makes the day better. Goodnight Sweetheart.  
PS: After dark tonight we were treated to a whole chorus of owls in the forest around here. I think there was some competition for the affections of a female among several males. They were loud and moving all over the area for over an hour. Night sounds.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564695,"Happy Mother's Day!  Today was the opposite of yesterday. Yesterday started out with nine miles of climbs followed by more tame flat and downhill terrain. Today had nine miles of easy downhill followed by 4000 feet of climbs all afternoon. It went alright but I think I'm stronger to face them the first part of the day. Did not sleep so well, both from just not getting comfortable in my tent and sleeping bag and also a whole crowd of whip-poor-wills having an all night convention.  Up early and away for an easy hike in the early morning mountain woods. From high in the mountains I got a view into the huge and irregularly shaped valley through which the James River flows. The valley was not open and straight like many are because there were smaller ridges inside the valley and the river flowed around them. That time of day I could not see the river because along its course the river was covered by fluffy white clouds and fog, showing where the river meandered through. Very pretty. Stopped at Matts Creek Shelter to change socks (feet hurting) and to have a snack. I had originally planned to hike to the James River and hitch hike into Glasgow Va to resupply and come back out and hike til end of day and then camp in the woods. Turns out I had enough food to hike another day and then hitch into Buena Vista.  At the shelter I overheard other hikers discussing their plans and found out that first road to Buena Vista is a remote gravel road - a difficult place to get a ride. I considered trying to stretch my existing food supply further yet and hike tomorrow to the second Buena Vista crossing. I hiked to the James River and crossed the James River footbridge, the longest footbridge on the trail - a beautiful area, I got pictures. After crossing I stepped into a parking lot and almost immediately a man offered to drive me to Glasgow to resupply. I figured that was the answer so away we went. I shopped at the little grocery store and got everything I needed, and then got lunch too before he brought me all the way back out to the trailhead. So that worked out well enough, but now I am loaded up with five days food to get me to Waynesboro, Va and that is what I carried on today's nine mile 4000 foot hike uphill. Oh well, I ended up at the same spot as I intended to if I had waited, so 2 1/2 hours of resupply did not slow down my progress - just took a little extra effort and now I'm set for the next section. The three big afternoon climbs were Little Rocky Row, Big Rocky Row and Bluff Mountain. At the summit of Bluff Mountain is a monument to Ottie Cline Powell saying the following ""This is the Exact Spot, Little Ottie Cline Powell's Body Was Found, April 5, 1891, After Straying From Tower Hill School House, November 9, A Distance Of 7 Miles. Age 4 Years, 11 Months"".  A sad story. This was followed by a couple of easy downhill miles to the Punchbowl Shelter where I am tenting with about a dozen others. I am set for the night. It is dark and I am in my tent listening to the frogs croaking in the creek and a small pond. A good day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Marble Spring Campsite

I started at Punchbowl Shelter in my tent with a beautiful early morning wake up and start. I will summarize this day's entry because it was a long hike pretty much in the forest canopy with few views and hiking the route of long Virginia ridge lines with many stream crossings. The day ended at Hog Camp Gap which is a beautiful grassy meadow near the forest service road. It was a tough 17.6 mile day.  I am trying to get to Waynesboro Va in 8 days from Daleville rather than the 9 days originally planned. There are tents scattered around the grassy open area.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565137,"This was a beautiful day. I started at Hog Camp Gap campsite. This section has lots of open grassy areas and the first thing out of camp today was a climb up from the meadow camp site to a long series of ridge lines with open grassy summits. It was fun to hike without the forest so close in on all sides and the openness of the summits provided nice views down to valleys or over to other ridges miles away. After climbing to the summit of the ridge yesterday, the trail stayed high today with smaller climbs and descents most of the way.  I took a side trail to see Spy Rock, a large exposed rock knob on the summit of the ridge, used to spy on enemy armies during the Civil War.  Also saw many beautiful views from The Priest Mountain out to the Virginia valley and ridge lines ahead. Then the final five miles were a long steady 3000 foot descent from the area of The Priest Shelter and overlook to the Tye River with its long suspension bridge. I am camped, tenting, with Naps and Solomon whom I have been camping around for several days, and other tenters and hammocker's as well. We are about 40 feet from the Tye River and it is a medium sized stream with a very deep and fast-moving flow. I went to the river to soak my feet and splash off my face, legs and hair - very cold water but felt so good to clean up a little. Now the river is providing background noise as it tumbles over boulders so it should give a good nights sleep. Very little phone service the last few days so I am missing my normal dose of contact with Marlene. The long run from Daleville to Waynesboro is continuing on. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hog Camp Gap

The first thing was a 3000 foot climb to the summit of Three Ridges Mountain. It was a long climb, one of the steepest I've faced so far. The entire way was stepping up large rocks, each just a little higher than a comfortable step for the average sized person and many times a big pull up larger steps. All along the way I was finding hikers stopped to catch their breath (including me) and panting as we were all surprised at the difficulty of this climb. The temperature rose to over 90 degrees. I got a message to Marlene that today was hard and she responded that she and others were praying for me. There were several iconic ridge line views from cliff side rock exposures, almost too beautiful to describe. The afternoon was a long rocky ridgeline hike with few views of note and very hot. The guidebook showed a campsite with a view at 17.5 miles. I set my mind to make it to this location so tomorrow's hike to the Waynesboro road would be manageable. I got to the campsite, having given all I had to get there. Set up my tent and went to sleep right away. Goodnight Sweetheart, and thank you for praying for me.","Tye River - Camp Site

Waynesboro (Rockfish Gap on the trail) is the gateway to Shenandoah National Park and over 100 miles of the AT is located within the park.  That middle section of Virginia from Daleville to Waynesboro is a tough section of about 134 miles. I had originally planned for 9 days to hike it and later tried to make it in 8 days. It was a long tough hike with no breaks. I am so glad to be here in Waynesboro. From here north the Blue Ridge Parkway changes to Skyline Drive and we will cross it regularly for over 100 miles. Today's hike was a continuation of the same terrain, punctuated with many beautiful streams and pretty forest coves.  I am staying at Stanimal's 328 Hiker Hostel. I have not finalized plans but have many chores to do. 
When friends saw me here at the Hostel when I came in today they could not hide their surprise at the amount of weight I have lost since Pearisburg Virginia, the last time they saw me.  I need to figure out how to eat more without carrying a significantly heavier pack. In the Shenandoah Park they have Waysides regularly spaced where you can buy ""real food"" to eat. Hopefully that will help if I can organize my eating around them.

I spent a lot of time with Adam, the owner, as he shuttled me around and I got to watch what went on and how he handled it. Lots of shuttle requests and bunk requests to keep track of and constantly on the phone. The project manager in me couldn't help but watch and organize. I went out early to shop for supplies and Adam drove by to tell me he'd be back in a few minutes to take me to Charlottesville to a Walgreens where I got a prescription filled. Back to the hostel to finalize packing up then another ride up to Rockfish Gap where I entered Shenandoah National Park. When I come into town in the middle of the day as I did yesterday, there is not enough time to get everything done, but taking another whole day off can seem too much. I did get to have a long conversation with Marlene last night and that was good, especially after all the weather and terrain blocking phone service I have hiked through lately.  So, today I compromised and took half a day and returned to the trail. It worked well. The last couple of hundred miles have been brutal with day after day of difficult hiking, both the rocky terrain and all the elevation change. The Park will be about 100 miles with more gentle hiking plus there will be ""Waysides"" where we can buy meals, snacks, and some resupply. That will hopefully allow me to eat a little better and also carry a lighter pack. The first Wayside will come up day after tomorrow and then more regularly after that. Can't wait. I intend to take full advantage. Hiking 10.1 miles today  puts me in position to visit them for some of my breakfasts, lunches and dinners and then hike ahead a few miles to camp. So I'm glad I left town to hike today. The hike was easier than any I've had lately. The views were not spectacular but I was able to relax and enjoy it.

Arrived at Loft Mountain Campground and camped in the woods outside the camp. When we arrived I took off my pack to discover my tent had come loose and fallen off my pack. It is a light tent that is stuffed into a small stuff sack which somehow came loose. As I was leaving to hike back to find it Cheesehead came up and said he had found it and carried it to a trail marker post 1.2 miles back, not knowing whose it was and which direction they were hiking. I nearly ran there and it was there safe and sound. Brought it back and got set up for the night just before the rain started.

Gravel Springs Hut is our destination for tomorrow night. They told of a bear attack where a bear sliced into a couple of their tents while they were sitting at the table by the shelter eating supper. At least two tents and some other equipment was damaged and destroyed. One of the hikers who lost his tent and other gear is El Vago, a hiker I was seeing regularly from north of the Smoky's through Damascus, Va. From register entries in the shelter registers I was aware that he was a few days ahead of me for the last several hundred miles. There was lots of talk of these matters during the evening. I remember the male hiker's name is Force Flex, but the two ladies' names have escaped me. Since all of you have been following my journal, please sign the guest book and let me know your names and also if you get any updates on how El Vago has recovered from these events.

I was able to keep moving steadily at a moderate pace. It really helps to be rested and well fed. So far northern Virginia is thick forest with little view into the woods itself or off the mountain into the valley below. I find myself staring at the trail, especially on this rocky trail. Good thing because I came across a large black snake that was aggressive and not willing to move off the trail. Virginia also has an unlimited supply of rocks, so I was able to persuade him to move aside. I came to the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter and went down the side trail to see it. Deluxe shelter with a deck featuring an adirondak style couch, separate gazebo with a fire pit, horse shoe pit complete with the shoes, shower using a barrel with a hose/shutoff valve, privy with a mail box stocked with toilet paper and large bottles of hand sanitizer, well-manicured lawn - all probably maintained by a caretaker. I got pictures. From there I descended a long way down to hike under I-66 and begin another long climb. I quickly met a young couple who were day hiking to the shelter at the top of the mountain. About 3/4 of the way up I found a large boulder that became my lunch spot. The couple came by and we spent about an hour with them asking me questions and discussing hiking. It was fun and also caused me to take an extra long and leisurely lunch break. That felt good. Tonight I am in a brand new shelter with mostly hikers who are new to me.

First I hiked about eight miles of normal northern Virginia trail, meaning wet, muddy, rocky, overgrown with vines and weeds, no views, with runoff coming down the trail to keep my feet wet - in the rain. Then I hit the southern end of something called the Roller Coaster. It is described as ""13.5 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents"". The Roller Coaster is everything I described earlier, plus very steep climbs and descents you could almost fall off from. The mountains keep going higher and higher and the trail has no switchbacks so it just goes straight up the side. It's like Virginia does not want hikers to escape into West Virginia. About ten miles into the Roller Coaster I hit a major milestone - 1000 miles. That felt so good and I got pictures. A few miles more today and I am staying in the Bears Den Hostel for the night.

Right away a local hiker came by and said the trail goes right up the border. I guess a couple of miles ahead I will cross into West Virginia again and Virginia will be officially done.  I am camped about 4 miles from Harpers Ferry WV. Tomorrow I will hike to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Visitors Center there to pick up a resupply box that Marlene sent. Marlene and I traded messages this morning and I sent pictures of today's events when I could. It was a good day. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Bear's Den Hostel

It was a stark reality to suddenly glimpse  the big muddy Shenandoah River through the trees and hear its powerful roar. Paralleling the river for awhile I came to the long bridge and hiked across. Winding through town a bit I came to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters. You have to do that. They give you a big welcome and tour to make sure you enjoy all the amenities. It is tradition to have your picture taken as part of this years through hiker class. My number is 442 as the hikers are in sequence as they come. I got a post card with my picture on it. They also have a really cool topographical map of the trail, Georgia to Maine, that I got to see. Marlene sent a resupply package there so I am set. Cousin Eddie was there with her parents whom I had met briefly way back in Damascus. They offered to take me with them to Walmart and the Outfitters so I could buy a new fuel canister for my stove. They are in town in their RV to see Cousin Eddie.  That was a very nice time. I am staying at the Econo Lodge and will take today off and a zero day tomorrow to rest.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566788,"Thoughts While Resting in Harpers Ferry
Reaching Daleville 
Hiking the Appalachian Trail is something you do all alone, and in the company of many others at the same time. Springer Mountain in north Georgia is where you start a northbound hike. There is no right way to do it. A hike can be a few miles starting anywhere and ending anywhere, but a thru hike means you intend to hike the entire length of the trail in a single hike, regardless of direction(s) or where you start. A northbound hike (NOBO) remains the most popular - so Georgia to Maine (GA-ME). I have had dozens of conversations with hikers who ask when I started and we have an immediate rapport when I tell them ""March 3"" because they know all that means. I had done four section hikes in the past, covering 728.1 miles to Daleville, Virginia, so I had a very intimate familiarity with the major milestones all the way, and a general knowledge of the rest. I could have started in Daleville and gone north. But when I got to Daleville this time I could say to myself ""there, I've covered all of that, now let's go see the rest"". Doing those 728.1 miles in a single hike is not the same as in several shorter hikes strung together. I needed to know I could do it in order to know I could do the rest. A thru hike has a special allure and I was so glad I started at Springer and gave myself a shot at hiking the whole trail. It remains to be seen how it will turn out. I stepped out of the woods at US 220 in Daleville and walked up to the same Howard Johnson's to get a room. I knew I would cross that road the next day into new territory. My mind was satisfied. I took one last look south and thought what a relief to be here. There were plenty of days where it was hard to pull myself up the next step. Redoing that section was not free. But, now let's see what's ahead. 
Virginia Blues
The ""Virginia Blues"" is a term given to whatever causes a hiker to struggle with the grind of doing 544 miles of tough hiking. Crossing a state border does not change the daily experience of exerting this much effort. The term is related to the realization that this is a very hard task you have signed up to do and only your own mental staying power can keep you doing it. Rationalization, and the practical advantage of talking yourself into the easier path are powerful. I think almost all thru hikers come to the realization that this is hard and I need a reason to keep doing it. My struggle came when I left Pearisburg and had six days to Daleville where I spent every night alone in my  tent or at a shelter and saw few people during the day. Were they all so far ahead that I could never catch them (could I ever make it to Maine like the fast hikers?). Then after Daleville it seemed Virginia changed. The terrain became closed in with tight forest (green tunnel) with few views, on extremely rocky trail with several thousand feet of climbs each day. It got hot, over 90 degrees, and the rain caused mud, and the trail was a stream and a series of waterfalls. I learned a lot. Take each day as it comes and expect something of value from each. Break the bigger chunks into smaller ones and do them one at a time. Expect better things ahead. I began to feel stronger and think less about the data available to me such as how many miles today or how much elevation change. I just did it as it came and looked forward even to the harder parts. The miles remaining in Virginia soon became less than those already hiked and I could see the end and how I would get there. Sure enough, I did. 
SNP
Shenandoah National Park has a little over 100 miles of the AT. It also has a generally well graded trail with an easier elevation change than I had been hiking just south of the park. When you get to Waynesboro, VA the park is your next section.  At Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro I caught up with Macguyver and Cousin Eddie, two hikers I had known and hiked with before, and I also met Smeagol, a hiker also from Birmingham, AL, and Cheesehead, originally from WI, now from Ohio, and moving to WY. We five hikers are very compatible in our hiking style and also our personalities and outlook on life. The other thing about SNP is the stores and Waysides where we could resupply and also stop in to eat real food. The five of us did the Park together and it was great. Fun to have friends around and we took full advantage to eat well and lighten our loads with the easy resupply. Macguyver and Cousin Eddie could not hide their surprise when they saw me at Stanimals Hostel and noticed the weight loss had continued  - I had not seen them for about 200 miles. I'm not fat now by any means but I did take full advantage of Park amenities and I think it has helped. I feel better and stronger. Also, the Park is one of those intermediate goals that I completed and the encouragement of that is so important. 
Virginia is Done
When I crossed the border from Tennessee into Virginia I was around 470 miles into the hike. Virginia holds about 544 miles of the trail. I was excited to reach that place. Virginia has many iconic trail places and viewpoints that are well-known and must-see milestones. But, to complete Virginia you will more than double your miles. At that point it is a goal so far out ahead as to be a distant mental concept rather than an attainable goal that you can see coming. It reminded me of my year in Vietnam where a lot of things could happen and no guarantees right up to the last day. The other day I came to a small nondescript sign in the middle of nowhere, marking that goal at the crossing from VA into WV. In my heart I was grateful and thankful. I thought back to that other crossing back there when I was happy to be approaching Damascus, Virginia, and I thought about all that had gone by in between.  This far I have come with the help of the Lord. 
1000 Miles
Miles hiked is a number you kind of watch and amuse yourself with. That first day when I reached Three Forks I remember thinking that I had hiked 3 1/2 miles today and 3 1/2 miles total. Seemed so puny. On ahead around Albert Mountain I reached 100 miles - both a big and a small number. About once a week I would text Marlene with the next 100 miles completed. Up and up. I remember at 600 miles it seemed so far and yet the end so distant. Still a 3-digit number. Crossing the 1000 mile mark means real miles to me. When that 1 becomes a 2, I will be in Maine, and I can actually see that happening.  (Yet, no guarantees).  People muse about statistics out here. At the beginning they say your chances of finishing are some number in the teens. At 1000 miles they say chances are 50-50. I'm not into ""chances"" but it does say something about the ""do-ability"" of this soon-to-be 68 year old to finish. 1000 miles feels good. It encourages me to believe I can get past the next hard and discouraging day.  But there is a lot to do yet. 
Coming Up Next
Things will start to happen in the next few sections. Having completed Virginia I will cross West Virginia tomorrow and enter Maryland and cross into Pennsylvania in about 40 some miles after that. Harpers Ferry is a very special place, and from the beginning of the idea to create the Appalachian Trail it has been the ""spiritual"" halfway point. The actual mathematical halfway point is in PA, with some traditions and hoopla associated with that. After that the ""to do"" number is smaller than the ""already done"" number.  So that will be fun. Pennsylvania presents it's own challenges. The southern part is supposed to be relatively easy. The last 185 miles or so the trail travels across a continuous legendary rock pile. Some of the most difficult hiking the whole way, with the reputation of ruining shoes. (I'm getting a new pair right at the start of PA). When you reach Delaware Water Gap and cross into New Jersey it is a big relief. Then fewer miles in NJ and NY and you reach New England when you cross into Connecticut- still a very long way to go but progress. But I need to guard against getting ahead of myself. 
White Blazes
The trail is marked with 2 inch by 6 inch white rectangles painted vertically on trees and rocks mostly. They provide an assurance that you are following the right path. On all my section hikes and now on my thru hike they have been a metaphor for my life.  When I see the next one ahead I say ""Thank you Jesus"" and ""Thank you Lord"" for that confirmation. I am a born again Christian. I believe in God and His son Jesus Christ. I believe in the story of man's rebellion against God and our need of a substitute, a Savior, because we cannot be good enough or do enough good works to please God on our own. I believe the Bible is God's word and it has been the guiding ""white blazes"" for my life - both to call me to God, and to tell me how to live day by day. God is personal to me and I mean no disrespect by ""chatting"" with Him as I would a friend. Jesus is a friend, and the relationship is real. For me the question is whether you believe in God or not. If a person does not, then only God can reveal himself. But if God exists, then he is not impotent and unable to get his message to us just the way he wants it.  Jesus is that message, described in the Bible. I'm 68 years old and am trusting in this message for my life now and for the future. I will not argue, but I am satisfied. On my hike I have heard the atheist. I've heard about evolution and the big bang. I've heard about the human genome and dna and all man's wisdom and discovery. I fully expect to be set straight by God about the dinosaurs and Adam and Eve and church denominations and all of it. But I am also fully confident in the white blazes of Gods word. I will go with them to the ultimate ""Maine"". 
You
I would like to say thank you again to each of you who have taken time to put a note in my journal guestbook or respond to Marlene on the Facebook page both to encourage me or pray when I ask. Please believe that each time it is a joy and source of strength to me.","Harper's Ferry

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567056,"After leaving the Econo Lodge I wound my way through Harpers Ferry on the trail, seeing a few of the sights, until I got to the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. There I became part of a Junior High field trip from somewhere in Pennsylvania. When the teacher and the chaperone found out I am a thru hiker I became a celebrity and was peppered with questions. That was fun. After crossing the Potomac I was officially done hiking the trail in West Virginia and began the 40+ miles of Maryland. Following the C & O Canal tow path for a few miles was very easy level hiking paralleling the river. Then a 1000 foot climb up to Weverton Cliffs and later White Rock Cliff, both with a good view. Beyond that, hiking in Maryland has been in a close woods over often rocky and muddy trail, but generally fairly easy. I am at the Rocky Run Shelter with mostly a new group of hikers. Cousin Eddie is still in town with family for a few days, Macguyver is too, and Smeagol has speeded ahead into PA. I am in a deep valley with no phone service.

Another oddity was going into a residential area, right down the property line between two homes and into a back yard to access the footbridge that takes the AT over I-70. If you can get their attention the 18-wheeler drivers will blow their horn at you. I did. I was at Annapolis Rocks for lunch and to filter water, another beautiful overlook from jagged cliffs. The terrain today was much the same as yesterday, or probably even more rocky. My left ankle is sore and I am considering going into a town to get a room so I can ice it.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567232,"I left the shelter before 7 intending to cross into Pennsylvania and then decide on a stopping point for the day. Soon into it I realized my left ankle soreness continued. There were some climbs that would normally not cause concern. The trail was sometimes fairly easy with a wide tread and little elevation change. But, the Maryland section has had very rocky sections as well. Rocks today were as bad as I have seen the entire trip. There were areas where I could look downhill as far as the eye could see and be faced with a jumble of rocks so tangled that I could not see the trail route through the trees. White blazes were masked as the dappled sunlight made everything look like a blaze or nothing look like a blaze. I decided to take it slowly. There were times when I stopped and looked all around, 360 degrees, to see the trail behind or before to get my bearings. The rocks were hard on my ankle and I got concerned about long term injury so I looked at the guide book for options in Waynesboro, PA to spend the night and ice it. I took many breaks and significantly reduced the food bag weight. No problem, I have plenty!  Finally I came to beautiful Pen Mar Park and rested on a bench. I called Marlene and decided to stop for the day and try to take care of my ankle. Ahead I came to the Mason-Dixon Line at the border MD-PA. That continues to be a great feeling when I can mark progress  from state to state. Pennsylvania has a lot of trail and has the reputation for the worst rocks in the last 185 miles before New Jersey, but that's a concern for another day. I made a few calls and got a shuttle to a hotel where I could walk to get the supplies I need. I spent the afternoon and evening with my leg elevated and ice on my ankle. If necessary I will stay another day rather than risk making it worse. My daughter Charity has given me some exercises for shin splints so I am doing those as well.

I have been experiencing stabbing pain in the ball of my ankle, feeling like an electric shock. Today I wrapped my foot and ankle with a bandage for support and hiked ahead to Tumbling Run Shelters. There were a couple of climbs and some rocky sections. I took it slow, covering only 8.2 miles for the day. I can still feel the discomfort but did not slip or fall so there is no new injury. I am planning low mile days for most of the coming week and hope that will make it better. A fellow hiker with shin splints did not follow doctors orders to reduce miles for awhile and he paid the price so I want to learn that lesson. Also the legendary 185 miles of terrible rocks in northern Pennsylvania are just ahead so I need to be in good shape to start into that section. Marlene is coming to visit me for my birthday this Friday. I hope to be near Boiling Springs, PA by then. It will be so good to see her, no matter how short the time. So today went well.

Since it had rained all morning the pool and snack bar there were closed so I got under a roof and had lunch from my pack supplies, comfortably sitting at a picnic table.  As I was leaving the park I crossed a bridge to find some campsites and noticed a bathroom building with the lights on. I went inside to find an outlet so I spent another hour resting under the awning while I charged my phone. Short mile days are relaxing. After that I had a big climb but a short 3 mile hike to the Quarry Gap Shelter for the night. This is a double shelter with a connecting breezeway between for cooking and social time, very nice - even had a pot of flowers hanging. I met O2 there and we two shared one of the shelter spaces. There were two in the other one as well and all the others tented or had hammocks. The rain stopped and we had a quiet evening and a good time in the close woods setting.

O2 and I decided to hike ahead to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, almost another 4 miles. The pull of a cheeseburger and fries at their camp store was too much to resist. It was another easy hike ahead and we enjoyed the lunch and I bought a few items to top off my food bag as well. The place seemed a little unorganized when we inquired about renting a campsite to set up our tents for the night.

We loaded up and hiked on fairly easy trail with a few steep climbs thrown in. Shortly after lunch we came to a high knob with large exposed rocks sticking out of the top - called The Rock Maze - and it was a maze of narrow passages and boulder climbing in two big sections. Fun but hard to do safely over wet rocks. A few miles ahead we came to a large corn field and several hay and barley fields laid out in large rectangles over a half mile on a side. The trail carefully skirted the edge and was routed around and between the fields to make us hikers be good citizens and respectful of the private property.

The video is hilarious and includes her finally tracking me down in my tent last evening. After meeting up and catching up we settled in for the evening. This morning Squeaks, O2 and I hiked into Boiling Springs and had breakfast, and then hiked an enjoyable and fairly easy hike to Carlisle, PA. Marlene and Allison had reservations at a hotel so Squeaks and I got an Uber ride to the hotel and checked into their rooms and enjoyed cleaning up and resting while awaiting their arrival.  It was a bit emotional when Marlene arrived at the door, since we had not seen each other since parting at the parking lot that cold day back on March 3 on Springer Mountain in Georgia. We packed a lot of fun into the rest of the day. I will not go into the complicated details, but Squeaks is raising money to fight pediatric cancer, a disease hitting very close to all of us, but especially Allison's family.

About 900 miles back when I had recovered from my stomach bug and returned to the trail to finish hiking the Smokys, I met a thru hiker named Cousin Eddie, a young woman from Texas. Since then Cousin Eddie and I have hiked together some and have also not seen each other for stretches of over 200 miles. Over time Cousin Eddie and I have learned that we share June 9th as our birthday. I met her parents in Damascus, Virginia and again in Harper's Ferry West Virginia recently, where they were very kind to give me a ride to do some errands in town and also asked me to join them for dinner one evening. After their recent visit in Harper's Ferry Cousin Eddie was also on track to catch me in Carlisle PA while Marlene was visiting. Long story a little shorter, she made it into town on June 8. So, Cousin Eddie was able to meet Squeaks before we dropped her off at the trailhead to hike north from Carlisle the next morning. Then Marlene, Allison, Cousin Eddie, and I spent the morning helping Cousin Eddie take care of some issues with her hiking shoes and we also celebrated birthdays again. Then Marlene and Allison dropped us off at the trailhead and we hiked 17.6 difficult miles that day with a very late start, getting all the way to Duncannon, PA and staying for free in the basement of Pastor Mike's house, Pastor of the Assemblies of God church. Their church began this ministry this year, about three weeks ago. I can vouch that they are doing a great job and the hiker grape vine is abuzz with good things to say about their kindness.

We are trying to do two fairly long days to get to Port Clinton for resupply, and the PA rocks may have something to say about that. I have a kind of brace on one ankle and the other is wrapped with tape. So far this is working well. The rocks are treacherous. It feels so good when we get a section of more normal trail mixed in between rocky sections. Elevation gains have been minimal, although I started right away this morning with a 1000 foot climb to the ridge top. Thankfully the trail stays on the ridge for miles with more minor undulations along the crest. I left first and Still Steve and Cousin Eddie and I met at the William Penn Shelter for lunch and to filter water. We had a good rest and started out again for the afternoon. About 2 miles ahead we met Slick, a 2004 thru hiker, doing trail magic at the road crossing. Sandwiches, fruit, drinks, candy, snacks were there in abundance and Slick did not want to carry it back home with him. We helped out. Ahead were some of the nastiest rocks we have come across so far. I just had to laugh because it was hard to believe the trail tread in some places. I think I am actually getting good at hiking on rocks now, but you cannot let your guard down for a single step. I felt strong after all the extra food.

Once I was at the top there were miles of trail with little elevation change. I guess it goes without saying, but the rocks were thick and difficult, but it seems that I am now hiking on rocks as though it is the normal trail. Cousin Eddie and I met at the Sand Spring side trail and went down to get water, then hiked ahead to the Eagles Nest Shelter turnoff and sat on a log to have lunch. In the afternoon it got very hot. I met a couple of local hikers coming south who were needing water, asking me for info on the location of the spring ahead. There was a relatively short climb, a few hundred feet, and I took a break at the top. When Cousin Eddie came up she said that it was the toughest climb in Pennsylvania so far. She was right. The water bars they make out of rocks and logs to prevent erosion on the trail were so steep that it was like a long stairwell with hundreds of steps going straight up with no switchbacks. I am so much stronger now and did the climb without a lot of stops, and felt good about that. During the afternoon I stumbled and hooked my right toe on a rock, stretching the innards along the top of my foot and up the front of my ankle. I was aware of the discomfort the rest of the day but kept going fine. I knew that the final descent into town was steep and could tell it was beginning when the trail began a gentle descent a couple of miles out. Soon I began to see ahead through the trees that the trail looked like a dropoff, disappearing over the edge. Steeper and steeper all the way down. A descent like that works your muscles and legs in a different way than any other terrain. My right ankle got a workout. It was a tough technical walk. Often each step needed to be considered for the safest  footing to get down. Finally I reached the bottom and sat on a bench along the local bike trail to rest and wait. When Cousin Eddie came in we wound our way across the many railroad tracks and a couple of bridges to cross the Schuylkill River. It was late afternoon so when we got to the main road I stuck out my thumb and got a ride from a local hiker lady who dropped us off at a Logan's Roadhouse where we splurged on a great meal to reward ourselves on making it in. More good things began to happen. We needed to resupply. As we were walking across the huge parking lot toward Walmart a couple pulled up in a truck, got out, and approached us to ask if we needed a ride anywhere. Joe and Sheri K were so kind to us. They took us to Walmart and went inside with us to shop. We had a good time running around the store, like they were long time friends. Afterwards they offered to take us about 15 miles out to their farm to take showers. They have a farm in the beautiful Pennsylvania countryside where they mostly raise pheasants, and other animals and crops, some for sale and some for their own use. After our showers we spent the evening getting a tour of their operation. It was such a great experience. Later they drove us back to the pavilion in Port Clinton where the city allows hikers to tent for the night. It was late, but we set up in the dark and got into our tents to sleep. There were about half a dozen hikers at the pavilion by then. 
(I will combine the next two days into this entry)
When I woke the next morning I did not feel well and my right foot/ankle was stiff and sore. As we were breaking camp a man drove by in a pickup truck and asked if we wanted a ride to a local restaurant for breakfast (Steve). He waited and then took us there, having breakfast with us and insisting on paying for our meals. They are so nice to hikers here in town. After that he dropped us off at a local barber shop where the barber just likes hikers and provides a hangout where you can shoot the breeze with the locals and relax. It is right next to the trail so you can hike on from there.  It became obvious to me that I was getting another stomach bug, with unpleasant symptoms. That, plus my sore foot made me decide to take the day off in town. Cousin Eddie got ready and hiked out. I called Steve and he was there in 10 minutes to take me to a Microtel about five miles away where I spent the rest of the day icing my foot and taking Immodium. When I woke up today my foot felt a little better but I still have some of the other symptoms and feel weak so I am taking another day off, planning to hike out tomorrow (Friday). Please pray for that to work out. Marlene has been my long distance nurse so we have talked several times. That was nice. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Hertline Campsite at Mile 1199.3

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569194,"After a few hiccups with the shuttle driver I was dropped off in Port Clinton around 8 and was on my way. A little meandering thru town and I began a one thousand foot climb which was a good test of my strength after the down time. Did fine. Sent pictures to Marlene from Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle when I had service. The PA rocks are ever present and make the hike a little tougher when you are not at your strongest. We are also beginning to have water issues as springs are fewer and some are dry. When you can get it you have to load up, making the pack weight heavier. I did 14.8 miles today, all I wanted after being under the weather. I am at Eckville shelter which is a converted garage on private property with a caretaker. Good enough for hikers. The caretaker will never be nominated for an award based on people skills, however. So I'm in for the night. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Port Clinton, Pennsylvania

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569204,"Left the shelter early and did another early morning 1000 foot climb. Today was all about the Pennsylvania rocks. Miles of normal trail, now defined as edge to edge rocks. This kind of trail has become normal and I am hiking it at about normal speed with extra care not to stumble or roll my ankles. Just pound on with my feet taking extra punishment. The next level of rock I'll call boulder piles. This trail is a jumble or maze of washing machine sized boulders with gaps between and some high steps, too high to step up or down especially with a pack on. Speed is cut way down  probably more than half. Today we added The Knife's Edge and Bake Oven Knob. This is the same as the boulder piles with car sized rocks mixed in, also with very steep ups and downs and long slanted rock faces with no place to get a grip.  I spent much time stopped and trying to figure out the safest way down or up and also the route the trail takes is hard to follow over this terrain. I fell several times because the rocks were wet in the rain, the only thing that could make it worse. Most were not a problem, only a few scrapes.  Tonight another hiker came in to the shelter and I will describe him as having ""wounds"" as he had a rough time on both the Knife's Edge and the Bake Oven Knob. Add to that two other issues. First, the rattlesnakes like to sun themselves on the rocks so we keep a constant eye peeled for them. So far not a problem. Second, the trail will climb up on a high ridge in PA, and stay there for miles with only a few hundred feet of elevation change up and down at intervals along the way. We get water from springs, mostly up to half a mile downhill off the ridge crest. There are almost no actual flowing streams. Many of the springs are going dry. There is no way to rush across Pennsylvania. My progress seems so slow. I am ready to finish this state. It is taking all my mental toughness to keep going - one day at a time. That's not a pretty picture, but this part of the hike is a difficult challenge with almost no breaks. I am planning to reach Delaware Water Gap on Tuesday, where I will step across the border into New Jersey and bid Pennsylvania goodbye. There - now I feel better!  Goodnight Sweetheart.","Eckville Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569212,"Wow!  Another one of those days. As I described trail conditions in yesterday's entry I think today blew that up with a new one. I came down off the mountain, crossed the Lehigh River, and was faced with the mother of all rock piles - a 1000 foot high pile combining all the descriptions from yesterday. Once at the top the trail is rerouted around a superfund remediation site. The guidebook description says in part ""Rocky steep trail from Lehigh Gap. Deforested ridge due to zinc smelting from 1898 - 1980. Remedial activities associated with the revegetation of Blue Mountain are currently being conducted near the A. T. between Lehigh Gap and Little Gap as part of the Palmerton Zinc Pile Superfund Site."" So that was fun. Finally coming down off the pile and superfund site on a four mile long ridge I stuck out my thumb at the road and got a hitch into Daniellsville, PA to a small grocery where I bought lunch, a few supply items, and the lady there filled my water bottles. A nice lady and her father gave me the ride, waited, and took me back to the trail. Worked out very well due to their kindness. After that it was a hot and rocky hike ahead where I am camped alone in the woods when I saw a place with a small and level site with not too many rocks. Water is continuing to be scarce and its availability will dictate my pace thru the remainder of Pennsylvania.  I sent Marlene a video from near the top of the rock pile and I think she posted it on Facebook. Beyond that I was not able to communicate today. Getting closer to the end of Pennsylvania. Goodnight Sweetheart.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569243,"Woke up at 4:00 this morning to a strange animal sound outside my tent. Sounded like a small animal with laryngitis trying to force its' voice to make a sound. I just listened. It sounded mad but did not do anything aggressive so I stayed quiet. Eventually it began to move around and it heard the sound coming from different sides and then from farther away and then very far away. I went back to sleep until around 5:30 and got out in dim light to find no sign of it. Oh well, I guess I'll never know. My plan was to hike about 15 or more miles today to get closer to Delaware Water Gap for a shorter hike tomorrow but I began to have thunder and lightning up on the ridge and felt safer getting down to lower elevation. I came to this small town and am sharing a cheap hotel room with Smeagol, another hiker from Birmingham. We will try to hitch up to the trail in the morning. I will have a full day to make DWG tomorrow. Today, more rocks and challenges with finding water, and I expect the same tomorrow. Talked with Marlene tonight and caught up on all the family news.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569355,"In my mind I'm going to New Jersey. Just 2/10 of a mile from the hostel I will cross the Delaware River on a long bridge and leave Pennsylvania behind. It's always nice to reach a milestone and mark progress, and that progress will be tomorrow. But in my mind I've already left. The anticipation has been there so long. I've been living in the ""are we there yet"" place. Good things happened in PA. Lots of milestones already reached. And Marlene and Allison came and we celebrated my 68th birthday. All the hikers feel this way. Our feet are bruised. We want to see some normal trail again. There is no magic in crossing the river. The geology of this area does not respect state lines, and there will be rocks in New Jersey tomorrow morning. But they can't start thinning out in New Jersey until we leave PA. 
This morning Smeagol and I got ready early and went to McDonalds for breakfast. We crossed the main street and soon a lady pulled over in a large pickup truck. Her son hiked last year and she repaid the kindness shown to him by giving us a ride to the trailhead. That was great and we were on the trail and on our way to DWG. Today was much better than yesterday. There was no rain or lightning threatening. The humidity was much lower. I felt strong after a good nights rest. The cool morning woods was great and we had a nice breeze all day. I just didn't feel it yesterday but today I was ready to finish out PA.  There was a big climb out of Wind Gap, as is normal. Once up on the ridge just more of the rocky PA trail. I put it on auto pilot and pushed ahead about 6 miles. Then came Wolf Rocks, a boulder pile and knife's edge along the cliff face. It was actually fun. I slowed down to enjoy it and be safe. Sent Marlene a picture but no video because it just looked like something bad could happen.  Then another long run similar to this morning. Finally I began to see the gap in the mountains through which the Delaware River flows. Then I saw the river. It tried my patience though because the trail took a long and complicated route to the bottom before coming to the town. Several local hikers were around and volunteered to get pictures for me at some of the more scenic spots. I walked into the church hostel and was greeted by several hikers I know. I soon had a bunk space and went to a local wings place with Smeagol. I am settled in for the evening trying to rest my feet and relax. The plan is to leave first thing in the morning. On to the New Jersey trail. I am so ready. Goodnight  Sweetheart.","Wind Gap, PA

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569881,"Smeagol and I got up and left from the hostel by 6:30. We wound our way thru the streets and crossed the long I-80 bridge over the Delaware River. About half way over we crossed into New Jersey. FINALLY out of PA!!  With cars and 18 Wheelers zooming by mere feet away on the other side of a three foot concrete barrier we got pictures to celebrate. It is so great to reach this milestone. After crossing the long bridge and a few local access roads we came to the Kittatinny Visitors Center parking lot. A man approached us. CHEESEHEAD!  He sent a text yesterday that he was about 40 miles north of us with family and asked about breakfast. Thinking he meant a sit down breakfast and a late start, I replied that we were planning to get an early start. Not to be deterred, he loaded up on McDonalds breakfast sandwiches and drinks and met us. We were not deterred either and happily helped devour the goodies while we caught up. Fun. Later we loaded up again and said goodbye. 
We hiked out of town and began the inevitable climb to the mountain top on nice local trail. Then a mile out we began a climb along a beautiful stream, and the rocks returned as expected. Smeagol was planning to hike a few miles further than me today, so when I took a break he continued on. A few miles ahead I reached a nice camp site and then came to Sunfish Pond, an iconic sight along the trail. Sunfish Pond is the southern-most glacial pond created during the last ice age. The trail around the pond qualifies as a boulder pile, going by my rocky-trail descriptions from a few days ago. I took it slow and got pictures. The climb continued to the summit of Kittatinny Mountain and the rocks along the summit of the ridge were like those in Pennsylvania. Over the last few weeks I have experienced various ailments in my ankles and feet. More recently I could tell my right hip joint was experiencing discomfort. This got more serious as the morning wore on. When I was in Vietnam I carried a squad radio which added up to 30 lbs to my load. When we would also load up with mortar rounds and machine gun ammo, my hip joints felt like I was exceeding my carrying capacity. That is what my right hip felt like today. By lunch time I was descending to a stream and gravel road where I had considered turning left to visit the Mohican Outdoor Center, run by the Appalachian Mountain Club, about .3 miles away, for lunch. Instead I filtered water there at the stream and had lunch to lighten my pack weight. Then I continued on, climbing more rocky trail up from the gap. I was in denial.  My hip was not going to be able to continue under these conditions. For a mile and a half I fought with myself over a decision I did not want to make. You can drive a car if a screw falls off somewhere but if the transmission goes out you are done. I did not want to admit that my hip joint was probably going to end my hike. I hiked forward using my trekking poles as makeshift crutches and limping along the summit of the beautiful ridge. I stopped and rested. I looked at the guide book and knew that I was kidding myself. The terrain ahead is not better. Access to a road ahead where I could expect help was even more remote. I saw the whole trip begin to crumble. But the reality was that I could not hike ahead in that condition. I delayed. I tried various short hikes ahead, even getting lost for a minute in my distraction. But finally I called Marlene. It was like when you have to tell someone a loved one has died - you think about giving them a few more minutes of not knowing. She knew something was wrong. Tough guy that I am, I can't hide it from her. I broke down and struggled to explain. This was not the plan. She stayed calm and we agreed I would hike back to the road and go to the Mohican Outdoor Center to try and get a ride to civilization.  I got a video of the view from that ridge, knowing it might be as far as I would get. At the trail junction with the Rattlesnake Swamp side trail I saw a huge rattlesnake. Tried to get a picture. It was mostly a downhill trail back to the road, which has its own set of challenges. I limped along leaning on my poles. There was no reward in this - hiking backwards, and maybe having to go home. My hip got worse as I went. Finally at the road I turned and got confused when I came to their sign on the direction to go so I called and someone came in a pickup truck to get me. I called Marlene and she was relieved to hear I was back down from the mountain. The center has basic bunks to use with a sleeping bag and they do meals as well so we decided I would spend the night there. I did.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570073,"When I awoke at the Mohican Outdoor  Center my right foot and hip were stiff and sore and I was limping around. It was not very encouraging. There was a decision to be made. Do I make arrangements to go home or do I try to see if there is something that can be done to heal this so I can continue. Honestly, the details of the next steps are a little fuzzy to me. Marlene did most of the leg work to look into insurance issues, a hotel in the area, and any ideas on medical procedures I could have. At some point she contacted Robert Funk, husband of Allison, Marlene's traveling partner when they came to celebrate my birthday.  Robert and Allison are good friends, and Robert has years of experience in the physical therapy field. Again, I am unsure of all that went on but Robert suggested a laser therapy that he had used before with good and fast results. Somehow they contacted a clinic in the area and got me an appointment and Marlene got me a hotel room not too far from the clinic. I called a shuttle driver and moved to the hotel. I went and had a session on my hip and on my foot. In the meantime Robert was setting up an exercise program for me for my foot and hip which he sent me via email and I printed off on the hotel computer. Robert and I talked by phone and via text messages numerous times throughout the days off. The second morning Robert called to check and suggested I get a second round of treatments on the laser. They were not even supposed to be open that day but somehow they called me back and got me right in. Then I decided to go all out and was willing to take more time off and try to get well so I could continue. The hotel had been booked for months for a wedding on that weekend. I could stay Thursday and Friday but not the weekend. I asked to be put on a waiting list for cancellations but as time passed nothing came up. I checked on my way out Friday morning to get some supplies and there was nothing. A few minutes later they called Marlene with a cancelation so I could stay the two more days. The hotel I stayed at has three floors. I talked with Robert about the need to carry my pack and we talked about doing the steps carrying my pack. He agreed, so I spent time doing his exercises and carrying my pack up and down the stairwell. It has 42 steps. I counted. The hotel staff enjoyed watching all of this and I am on a first name basis with all of them. I also iced my foot and hip regularly the whole weekend. Honestly I don't know how to evaluate any of these activities and cannot answer the question ""Did it help?""  I've always said the only way to get ready for a hike is to hike. But I believe we have done our best and we have put it into the hands of the Lord. I am willing to go with whatever He decides. I have a shuttle lined up to take me back to the trail in the morning.","Hotel

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570075,"The day of reckoning had arrived. Today I would leave the comforts of the hotel room, put on my pack, and hit the trail to see if the activities of the last four days would make me strong enough to continue hiking or would confirm that my right hip could no longer bear the load. I was relieved. It was time to know. The shuttle driver called to let me know he could come an hour earlier than planned. That was great as I had hoped to get going earlier than even that. I had the complimentary breakfast and then packed and repacked and took everything down to the lobby. I took the stairs and when I reached the bottom I turned around and climbed to the 3rd floor one more time just to see how it felt. Out to the lobby and in a few minutes I was loaded and ready to go. This shuttle driver drives like me. He's a little old man and never in a hurry, never goes over the speed limit. No matter. We'd get there. I unloaded on the remote gravel road next to the stream and footbridge, paid him, and watched him roll slowly away. I strapped on the pack and walked over to the far side where the trail continued, going up hill from the first step. I stopped and had a quiet prayer meeting, asking God to work His will today, and agreeing to be ok with whatever He decided.  It was a good test. The trail was rocky from the start and had sections of large boulders, very high steps up and down, and steep sections. At first I was hyper sensitive, trying to sense everything my right foot and hip were feeling. Soon I was in the groove and hiking along slow and steady.  Even without an injury the first steps under the weight of the pack are always a wake up call after time off, even one day off. Not sure I've ever had four days off before. I was very careful. I went slow. Even then I was amazed at how quickly I was standing on the cliff face where I had stopped to turn around last Wednesday. This seemed to be working. I had not stumbled or had any straining event, and I felt fine. There was no question. I was going forward!  I took a selfie and sent the news to Marlene. I knew she was wondering and waiting to hear. A mile ahead stood a fire lookout tower. I got a picture but did not climb it - no unnecessary efforts today. I stopped several times to adjust the support I had wrapped on my right foot. It started to hurt shortly after I hiked past the turnaround point from the other day. It began to be a concern - the hip was handling it fine with only a few twinges but my foot just could not stop hurting. Finally after tightening and re-wrapping several different ways I had the idea to stop tightening and try loosening the wrap. That worked!!  I put the wrap on very loose and even loosened the laces on that shoe. It behaved fine the rest of the day. The trail threw every kind of PA rock challenge at me. Regular rocky trail, boulder piles, and the slanted cliff face with boulder piles. I took it slow and completed 10.2 miles to a campsite with a water source. I am set up for the night, so far camping alone. I am encouraged and will try to increase both speed and distance a little tomorrow because of the distance to places to stay and the availability of water. I will continue to be careful. I thank God and the prayers of so many friends who are supporting and encouraging me in this. I am continuing on into New Jersey. Thanks to all.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570229,"I was camped alone and had a good night's sleep and was up at the dim beginning of the day getting packed and having breakfast. The morning woods is so enjoyable. The rocks continued and the trail was a little more up and down today, including something called Jacobs Ladder. About 7 miles ahead I came to US Highway 206 and hitchhiked into Branchville, NJ to Dale's Market where I bought supplies and got real food for lunch. It took awhile to get a ride each way but I made it back to the trailhead and continued on, refreshed with a big lunch and Gatorade.  The major climb for the day was Sunrise Mountain which has a stone pavilion at the summit. There I watched thunderstorms blowing across the valley but decided to hike ahead anyway. I got a little wet later but nothing to worry about.  Mid afternoon I was hiking toward a clearing ahead when suddenly a big male black bear ran across the trail in front of me. That is their typical reaction when they hear and then see you coming. It was very fast and I had no time to get a picture. Exciting!  A few miles more and I arrived at this shelter for the night, satisfied with a 15 mile day. My feet and hip did ok and I am encouraged that they will handle the load. I hope the rocks thin out ahead but the reports are not that encouraging, and conflicting depending on whether I talk to a local or to a thru hiker. The thru hiker grapevine seems more dependable and it says the rocks continue on into New York. I am trying to hike carefully to help my leg but also try to make good time as the places to camp and water sources are a challenge in this area. Someone in the area brought plastic jugs of water to this shelter for the hikers today knowing the water sources are drying up. (This shelter is pretty close to a road). That was so helpful but you can't depend on it and then get caught dry. So I loaded up with a heavy water supply at Dale's Market. Today wore me out but it was a good day for me.

CBiscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571609,"I was up early at the Mashipacong Shelter and ready to hike out by 6:30. I made good time for the first three miles, passing the turnoff for the Rutherford Shelter. Shortly after that I had a problem. The guidebook elevation chart shows a small notch where the trail does a quick dip, dropping less than 200 feet with a quick bottom and then climbing abruptly up the other side. On the descent the trail is a steep trough with long rock faces. I took it slowly, but about half way down my left foot lost its grip and went forward while my right foot folded underneath me.  I remember that I turned sideways and slid down the chute to a flatter spot. This was bad. There was a sharp pain in my right hip and along the top of my right foot, at least at first. Then I threw up my breakfast.  Once I had my bearings I was able to slip off my pack and straighten out. Other than a few scrapes there were no external injuries that I could see. When I was more or less in a sitting position my foot was painful but the most prominent pain was in my right hip. As I sat there I could feel myself stiffening up. There was no one else around. About two miles ahead is the High Point State Park Headquarters building (New Jersey). Signs at the shelter had promised a free soft drink to thru hikers who stopped in on their way. That building became my goal. I slid on my butt and dragged my pack and poles the rest of the way to the bottom. Once down, I decided I needed to put on my pack and try to carry it as normally as possible.  My right foot was painful but handled it and I kept it as straight and level as  I could. My hip felt a more deep and blunt pain and a weakness when I tried to step up the rocks.  There was no power to lift myself up. The trail across the bottom was edge to edge rocks.  The climb up the other side was one of those rock piles. I'm not sure how I did that to tell the truth. Then more of the ridge line slabs and rocky trail until the last half mile. There it was smooth easy trail as is normal where local family hikers are encouraged to explore.  At a clearing I saw the building to my left. The trail went ahead about another 100 yards and temporarily back into the woods before it came out at the road.  I went half way, hidden in the trees, and stopped to take it all in.  Before the hike I decided I would stand the pain involved in a thru hike but not do damage to myself, given a certain amount of pain and discomfort were built in to this kind of activity. I would continue as long as it was fun.  I was also realistic, knowing that I might not get to Katahdin since only a fraction of hikers who start in Georgia actually finish in Maine.  I was encouraged after I took the time off and had the laser treatments, but complete healing was slow to come and the time available to finish before winter in Maine was a real factor if I could not move forward with some consistency.  The last couple of days were encouraging. I was chipping away at it again. I felt like I could make it. But the last 500 miles up there are pretty tough, especially with the need to carry cold weather gear again and longer resupply times with a heavier food bag.  All of that sounds logical, like I did a pro/con list to reveal the answer. But I knew two hours ago that I could not keep going. It's just that down there where the trail crossed the road the thru hikers would eventually go straight and I would turn left, leaving the trail.","Mashipacong Shelter
