Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558610,"This is Ma Fahmah reporting on Fahmah and Klipspringer. They are together again on the AT for celebration of their 10-year anniversary. I dropped them off in Dahlonega, GA where they stayed at the Hiker Hostel and at the Quality Inn in Dahlonega before starting on their hike.They started off slowly, returning to the Hostel a couple of nights, then up to Neel Gap where they stayed at a cabin there. The second day, Fahmah had lost his rain gear and his glasses and then found them, on third day he lost his wallet, then found it and then lost his wallet again, but again, found it! He has a little memory thing going on! Well, what do you expect at 77 (on April 5th)? Like he says, ""wait till you get old""! I headed out to Texas for a visit with my brother and my sister and their families, returning on Wednesday, March 29. We met in Hiawassee, GA where they had hiked nearly 11 miles in a day to get to Unicoi Gap, where I picked them up on Thursday, March 30. They had shipped drop boxes to Franklin and all the hotels in Hiawassee were full because of impending rain and the ""Hiker Trash Weekend"" celebration held there. Our friends, and trail angels, Dave and Robin, live in Hiawassee and we didn't want to be in the area without seeing them. Fahmah called them while he was still on the trail and told them when we would be there. Well, I wasn't picking him up until around 1 pm so I went to the local Ingles grocery store to pick up some snacks and cold cokes for them. As I rounded a corner toward the dairy, I recognized a familiar face.....Robin in the same store. It was wonderful to see her. She was busy that night, but we said we would get together while we were around. I drove up to Unicoi Gap to pick them up. There were trail angels set up feeding lunch to the hikers as they came down the trail. Not much after 1 pm Fahmah and Klip came. They had their lunch and cold drinks and rested a bit. We decided we would head on up to Franklin for a hotel and to pick up the packages they had sent forward, since everything was full in Hiawassee anyway. It was about a 40 minute drive and we went to Haven's to pick up the packages, but he was full too, so we went to the Sapphire Inn for a couple of nights. Fahmah called Robin again and told her we were in Franklin. She and Dave came up for dinner and we had a great visit and terrific meal at Lucio's, a little Italian restaurant in walking distance to the hotel, where we had delicious meals! Look them up if you are in Franklin!I had planned to leave Franklin on Saturday afternoon, and the guys were going to start hiking again on Sunday morning. But, I guess they thought they had rested long enough, so on Saturday, after having breakfast and doing their laundry, we headed up to Winding Stair Gap, where I left them around 2 pm (2 hours later than I wanted to be on the road) It was check out time at the hotel, but, of course, Fahmah didn't have his pack sorted out. So we just dumped everything in the car and left (I lost the key to the room in all the confusion, but the hotel was gracious and said not to worry!) It took him 2 hours to get his pack put together and off they went!","Springer Mountain, GA

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558626,"I left them at Winding Stair Gap and headed toward Massachusetts. Made it to Harrisonburg, VA and stayed overnight. Received a call from Fahmah. They were camped at Siler Bald overnight. On Sunday, I rode the rest of the way to MA and arrived around 7 pm. Received a call from Fahmah. They were at Wayah Bald tower and enjoying a rest. They stayed at the shelter (in their tents) overnight. I received a call today from Fahmah. It was raining this morning and he was soaking wet and cold! All his gear was wet and he was very uncomfortable. Am waiting to hear from him with the result. Don't know if they waited it out till the rain stopped or if they went back into Franklin to dry out. Will update when I find out.","Siler Bald

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558726,"After I talked to Fahmah they looked at the forecast for their local area. Snow coming on Thursday, 3-4 inches. Fahmah couldn't imagine handling that, already being cold and wet. He called Dave and Robin again. They rescued the old guys, picked them up around 6pm, stopped for an AYCE dinner, and brought them home with them! I heard from Klip and Robin. Fahmah warmed up in a hot shower. They have decided on a Plan B. Dave and Robin will drop them at Unicoi Gap where I picked them up, and they will walk north. They will pick them up Thursday morning, after a 16 mile hike, and take them home again overnight. Then they will deliver them to Nantahala Outdoor center where Fahmah will be able to get a new rain jacket that doesn't leak! The area they are skipping was severely damaged in the forest fires last year and a very difficult hike. Good choice for the guys. Dave and Robin coming to the rescue once more! So happy for friends like them.","Wayah Shelter

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558971,"On Tuesday, 4/4 Fahmah and Klip were dropped off at Unicoi Gap and they hiked in approx. 5 miles to Tray Mtn where they camped overnight. They woke up in the morning and found that rain was in the forecast for the evening and overnight. It was Fahmah's birthday but they were determined to hike the full 11 miles out before nightfall, without stopping overnight again. Fahmah called Robin and Dave and, of course, they came to rescue again, even leaving a car for them to drive back to their house, while Robin and Dave had a dinner date with friends. They found some hot turkey soup and crackers, warm baths, and wine for Fahmah and bourbon for Klip!! They are being treated like royalty!! Happy Birthday, Fahmah! 77 and going strong!! Thursday will be a zero day (while it rains) and on Friday, Dave and Robin will drop them at Nantahala Outdoor Center.Fahmah would like to thank everyone for the birthday wishes and the phone calls. He was supposed to clean out his mailbox last night after we talked so you can leave messages. But he may have been too tired and plan to take care of it today. We will see. I wouldn't blame him after hiking 11 miles!","Hiawassee

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558972,"I haven't heard from Fahmah yet today, but I did hear from Dave. See the photo of Fahmah's satisfied face at breakfast! There is a story behind that hat. When Dave and Robin picked them up on Monday night, cold and wet, they took them out to eat before taking them home. Fahmah left his John Deere hat at the restaurant. Robin told me he lost his hat, but Dave gave him another to wear. I said he probably left it at the restaurant, as he has done that before! Well, Dave called the restaurant and sure enough, he had left it there. Dave went there and retrieved it for Fahmah! I see he has it back on his head!!! Now, don't leave it again! Will complete the update when I hear from Fahmah today.","Dicks Creek, Hwy 76

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559113,"Just got the photo above from Klip. Fahmah has a new rain jacket. Ijust looked at the weather forecast for the area. I didn't see any snow, but it will be breezy. Dave and Robin very graciously drove them to the NOC where they have reservations in the bunkhouse for the next 2 nights. It will be a 5 day hike for them to Fontana Dam, where they will enter the Smokies. Hope there isn't too much snow up there for the guys. We have 5-6 days for spring to come! Pray for it please! We don't want the old guys to be too cold. It is beautiful at the NOC with all kinds of activities available. Check it out at www.NOC.com. White water rafting, zip lines, however, I doubt the old guys will be partaking of the fun this time! ??Will finish the update when I hear from Fahmah (if he has phone service).

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559701,"Well, it has been a while since an update. Fahmah and Klip left from Nantahala on Sunday, where they had rested and resupplied. I got a call when he was on the top of the mountain before Sassafras Gap. He called me again from Sassafras Shelter where they stayed overnight. Fahmah is feeling like he can't keep up with Klip and may be holding him back. But he just can't walk as fast and as long as Klip can.We spoke during the day yesterday. He sounded tired and a little discouraged but didn't say anything. It had been a couple of very tough hikes for Fahmah. Then last night I received a text from Klip that it was probably time for Fahmah to come home. They had hiked to Stecoah Gap and had actually found a hostel that was not listed in the Companion or The A.T.Guide. They told me the name, but I forgot what it was (Wolf Creek). A large house with individual guest rooms. I spoke to Fahmah again last night and he said he wasn't sure what he was going to do. His feet were really hurting him and the hiking was tough. But, he would sleep on it and let me know this morning. Well, he thought about it, and decided since he was there, and probably wouldn't have the opportunity again, he would hike on to Fontana Dam and head in to the Smokies with Klip. I thank God for his decision. I really wasn't ready to drive down there so soon, but I would be there in a minute if he needed me. They are headed out today. Will be about 2 days to Fontana. They have supplies and their Smokies Permits waiting for them when they get there. Hopefully they will find lodging for overnight before heading in to the Smokies. Wait for the next update to find out what happens!","Nantahala Outdoor Center in Bryson City, NC

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560186,"The hikers had a good but tough hike in to Fontana. It took 2 days, they arrived mid afternoon on Thursday, 4/13/17. They had reservations already made for 2 nights. They would plan to hike out of Fontana on Saturday morning. The telephone reception (Verizon) was sketchy and Fahmah had to step outside whenever he called me. I had heard from Robin that they hiked southbound a 4 mile trek from Betty's Creek to Carter's Gap and passed 41 NB hikers in that small time. She also said that they met the Barefoot Hiker that Fahmah and Klip had told them about. That area had been burned in the fires last year and the hikers they met were happy to be out of it. Robin and Dave didn't have the heart to tell them they would hit the burnout area again from Wayah Gap all the way to the NOC. That is the section that Fahmah and Klip skipped. We also read that there was another fire this year just above Winding Stair Gap where I had dropped them off after Franklin. 
The two have been well stocked, well fed, and well rested and called this morning to say they were off into the Smokies. Of course, nothing goes as planned. Fahmah went to use the ATM before leaving and his card wouldn't work. Klip texted me for the pass code and tried it too, and still wouldn't work. It was just as I was supposed to leave for church, but I made an emergency call to the bank (thank goodness for Saturday hours) and she checked in to it. She could see the transaction and the refusal but didn't know why. We assumed a fraud block because we had not notified the bank that Fahmah would be traveling out of state. She notated the file and we will try again when he gets to Gatlinburg. That is 35 miles away.....5 days for the old guys and the rugged terrain they will be hiking. Please pray for safe travels and decent weather. There is actually rain and thunderstorms in the forecast. Let's pray the weather man is wrong this time! Please!! Fahmah hates thunderstorms and refuses to hike in them. Good luck, Klip!
Fahmah called me this afternoon around 3. They had hiked since this morning, all up hill, steep up hill! And still had about a mile and 1/2 to get to the camp ground where they will stay tonight. He was happy to sit down a bit while we talked. We talked for a long time. Hope we didn't use up all his power in his phone! Will keep you updated when I hear more from them. Hope you all have a Blessed Easter.","Fontana Dam

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560886,"Time for an update! Will have more news tomorrow, but will fill you in for now.I hadn't heard from Fahmah since the first day they left Fontana, on the 15th. Iknew the phone coverage would be sketchy at best while he was in the GSNP. And, apparently it was. Finally on Tuesday, while all my family was here for a get together, he was able to get some service and I got a short call. He was doing pretty good. There had been rain a couple of days and they got a little wet, but nothing that was too discouraging for them. I had seen lightning in the forecast and was worried, but it turned out all right. Lionel was not having a great day when we talked. It was strange to hear he was grumbling instead of Fahmah! They expect to be in to Gatlinburg today and asked if I could book a room for them. They needed to save their power in their phones so they would be able to call for a ride when they get to Newfound Gap. It is 15 miles west from the AT and they will need a ride! They asked if I could book a room for them so they would be sure to have a room to stay in when they got there. I mailed Fahmah's supplies to NOC Great Outpost and booked a room at the Motel 6, which is the closest motel from there. They didn't tell me 2 nights, but I booked 2 anyway. They can make adjustments when they sign in. I figured they would need the rest and would need to do laundry. I'm sure I will hear from Fahmah once they arrive in Gatlinburg. Will update more tomorrow.","Birch Spring Gap Campsite

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561037,"I received a call from Fahmah early yesterday afternoon. They were in Gatlinburg. When they hiked in to Newfound Gap there were other hikers, all looking for a ride in to Gatlinburg. Nobody was having much luck. Fahmah and Klip had tried and couldn't even find a taxi! They started talking with an elderly couple that were stopped there from Wisconsin. (They said elderly but they were younger than Fahmah and Klip!) well they visited with them for a while and told them their dilemma the couple gave them a ride all the way in (15 or more miles). Even went to the far end of town because they couldn't remember where the hotel was. They had to turn around and finally found it near where they had entered town. When the couple left them they headed back toward Newfound Gap. They were actually traveling the opposite way! Fahmah said they were truly Trail Angels and can't thank them enough for their help!! When I had booked the room all I could get was a king bed with a pull out sofa. When they registered the hotel came up with a room with 2 queens!! That was terrific because they both needed a good rest. They rested and bathed and went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner. Had a good night's sleep and Fahmah called this morning again. He had trouble with his ATM card in Fontana and was going to try it this morning. He asked for a battery pack so he can charge his phone while he is in the woods in case it runs out of power. I headed down to Best Buy to get one. I got another call from Fahmah telling me his ATM card worked this time!! The call to the bank last week must have worked! The hotel (Motel 6) has a balcony from the room where the guys are staying. Fahmah said there is a beautiful little trout stream running just below the balcony that makes him wish he had his fishing pole!They have another 35 miles till they exit the GSNP at Green Corner Road. They will stop at Standing Bear Hostel when they get there. Should arrive by Wednesday or Thursday. I'll be sending his resupply there along with his battery pack and he wants me to send his teeth!! Hopefully Klip can talk him in to wearing them better than I can!!Fahmah was going to get a buzz cut and a shave today. Hopefully Klip will send me a picture to upload. Will post more when I know more. TTFN","Newfound Gap, Gatlinburg, TN

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561469,"Today, Monday, 4/24, they are waiting for the shuttle to take them from Gatlinburg back to Newfound Gap, where they will start their hike again. They are well rested and fed and ready to get back on the trail again. When Fahmah picked up his re-supply box I had sent to the NOC Outpost there, I got a message from Klip, saying it was 3-4 days to Green Corner Rd, and Fahmah has 84 days of food!!! I guess he had to send a box forward so I don't have to send any more food until Hot Springs. Klip had to get some medicine for his ""Fahmahitis"". I'll upload a photo soon. They have had 4-5 inches of rain, therefore stayed overnight 4 nights total and are leaving today. The brook below the hotel was a flood! Running too heavy for even the ducks! Klip tells me Fahmah has bought some gaiters! Oh no, that will be an extra hour each morning while Fahmah puts them on. (Klip can sleep an extra hour every day!) I don't think Fahmah got his shave or his haircut. It didn't look it in the photos Klip sent. I will upload them as soon as I can. They are on my iPhone. He has been feeling very self conscious about his teeth and had asked me to send them. I was going to, but after talking it over with the kids and Klip, we have thought better of that. What if they got lost or ruined in some way? He decided to wait until I see him in May. (phew!) I did send him a charger so that he can recharge his phone while he is on the trail. That way, if there is service, I will get to talk to him. He just called from Newfound Gap. It was real noisy, with hikers going in to town and hikers going back on the trail!! Meeting up with hikers they had met on the trail before! Hopefully the sun will shine a few days and dry things out. Will update when I have more news. Pray for them please.","Motel 6, Gatlinburg, TN

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562485,"Fahmah had no phone service for the 4 days traveling north on the AT out of the Smokies. At least, he didn't call me. Mid afternoon on Friday the 28th I heard from Klip, do not fear, the ""creeping  thermo-rest still lives""!  They were heading toward Standing Bear Hostel for a much needed stop and rest. It was a wet and muddy 4 days.  I got a call from Fahmah shortly afterward but we couldn't keep a connection. He didn't tell me much. Of course, he usually doesn't.  I was on my way to Amanda's confirmation and was relieved to have finally heard something!  Lionel sent a message saying they were heading toward Hot Springs, NC on Sunday morning.   I still didn't hear from Fahmah until about 2:30 this afternoon. They were about 5 miles north heading toward Groundhog Creek Shelter where they will stay.  They must have been on Snowbird Mtn, a grassy bald. It was real windy.

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562920,"I hadn't heard from Fahmah since Sunday night. They were on the other side of a mountain where there was an FAA tower. He had great phone service at the Groundhog shelter when he called me. That was short lived.  No service again until they got in to Hot Springs a little before 3 this afternoon. There was no room at Laughing Heart Lodge where I had sent his resupply box. He didn't think to ask for the box and by the time we talked he was too tired to get it tonight. He just wanted a shower and dinner!  They plan to stay there for 2 nights. Klip definitely want to take a soak in the hot springs there. I really hope Fahmah tries it too!  It would do them both good to soak their tired, old bodies!!  They arrived in Hot Springs a day sooner than I thought they would.  They travelled 33 miles in 3 1/2 days!  I'm impressed!
There are lots of hikers in the area. I'll fill you in on any stories they share when I hear them.

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563779,"Well, that was heart breaking.  I just updated the journal and lost everything I had entered!  Oh well, here we go again!
Fahmah and Klip ended up staying in Hot Springs for 4 nights.  The day they had planned to leave, it was pouring rain and they decided to stay another night.  They were planning to stay at Hikers Paradise, 4 days away.  I went to ship his resupply and found that the telephone number we had was not in service.  They decided to stay at Hemlock Hollow instead at Log Cabin Rd in Greenville, NC.  On Friday morning I send his package to their address.
While in Hot Springs they met up with an Irish couple that they visited with and had breakfast with.  Fahmah really enjoyed their spirit and listening to her brogue.  He said I would like them for sure if I were to meet them.  They left the day before the guys in the pouring rain!
Well, it turned out that Hemlock Hollow was a lot closer than we thought.  They arrived there in just 2 days.  It was only a little over 12 miles!  Don't know how we made that mistake, but, oh well!  The resupply was on it's way there, to be delivered on Monday.  But that's not bad, they got there on Sunday and are able to get back on the trail today.  Hopefully the weather won't be too bad.  It will be 6 days to Erwin as long as all goes as planned.
There is NO phone service at Hemlock Hollow.  Fahmah called me last night from the owner's land line.  We were only able to talk a few minutes.  In the conversation, I told him how much I missed him.  He said ""big ditto"".  What I heard was ""big deal""!  My heart sank.  I asked him why he said that, then he corrected me and all was good again.  That is just the way things have been these days.  I really miss him.  I will be meeting them at Uncle Jonny's in Erwin on the 16th or 17th.  We are heading up to Damascus, VA for Hiker Trail Days the 18th to th 20th.  We plan to meet up with Jack there!  The Tres Amigos will be together again, if only for a couple of days.  
Pray for good weather for the old guys and safe travels for all.  What is the next plan??  Who knows.  Until then...................","Log Cabin Rd

Fahmah has called me often since they arrived at Johnny's on Sunday.   He has to walk out to the road to get good service though!  He didn't call Jack to confirm that he would meet us in Damascus so I called tonight.  Jack is coming and I invited him to stay with us at the motel in Abingdon.  Reservations are all made!  Fahmah was looking through a book at Johnny's with photos of a bunch of hikers in it and there was a photo of Jack!  He was tickled and showed Klip.  Well, I'll be darned, if the guy who took those photos and created the book didn't show up at Johnny's today on his way to Trail Days!!  I told Jack about it.  It turns out Jack was there, but not hiking, when he was taking photos, and included him in the book!  We will hear all about it when we get to Trail Days!!  Tony pointed Jack's picture out to the guy and the guy said ""Oh yeah, I remember him, he was quite the talker!""  He knew Jack!!

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565311,"We arrived in Abingdon from Erwin around 2 pm on Wednesday. We have a Cracker Barrel right near the hotel, so, of course, we had dinner there!  I called Jack to let him know the name of the hotel and room numbers.  He would be here on Thursday around noon. After dinner we took a ride to Damascus to see how much was prepared for Trail Days. It is about a 14 mile ride, very convenient to the hotel.  We came back and celebrated Klip's birthday, his 80th, with apple pie and ice cream!  Jack had said he'd be here around noon so we were watching for him. About 12:30 we stepped out on the balcony and saw a red van come in to the parking lot. I recognized Jack driving. He said he had just pulled in to call me, looked up and saw us. Had actually found us by mistake!  We went to Cracker Barrel again with Jack for lunch.  We planned to go to the Damascus Old Mill where the food is good and the atmosphere is great right on the river that runs behind it.  
A lot of hikers had arrived in town and when we sat down at our table, we looked down on the deck below and there were was Ole Man and Navigator from the AT Lodge Hostel in Millinocket, ME.  Dinner was delicious, visit was nice. We took a little stroll down Main St Damascus, Fahmah and Jack holding hands and skipping, a dream come true!!!  There is always lots of laughing and stories from that 2007 hike!  They all met on the trail that year and hiked all the way to Harpers Ferry WVA and flipped up to Mt Katahdin in ME and hiked south. Lionel had to head back to So Africa so, when they finished hiking the Whites, I gave him a ride to Boston for his flight home.  Fahmah and Jack continued on to North Adams where I picked him up and Tony brought his truck back, and Jack and Tony finished the trail, using the truck from trail head to trail head each day and arrived back in Harpers Ferry on Dec 7th to complete their thru hike in 2007!!  Oh, the stories they can tell!!  And these reunions are wonderful!  
Today we went back to Damascus, had breakfast at Cowboy's, and found parking near the park where the festivities were planned. There are dozens of vendors selling hiking equipment or supplies, having drawings, there are booths for ALDHA, The Appalachian Trail Conservancy, The Hiker Yearbook, and many others.  There is another section that has vendors selling crafts, tee shirts, jewelry, pottery, books and dozens of other booths. And then all the junk food vendors, funnel cakes, ice cream, barbecue, gator meat, fresh squeezed lemon juice and anything your heart may desire!  There is a stage, music, and speakers where there will be a hiker talent show after the Hiker Parade!!  The Damascus Trail Days is the largest Hiker celebration held on the trail each year.  Well, I will sign off for now.  Tomorrow will be a long day and Sunday Jack will head for home early and Fahmah, Klip and I will head back to Templeton, our adventure will have come to an end!  Thank you for following along!  Happy Trails, from Ma and Pa Fahmah","Uncle Johnnys, Erwin, TN
