Wanderer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553188,"Hello!!
I registered for my NOBO hike beginning April 2, 2017 out of Springer Mountain, GA.
Hiking this year has been a last minute decision. I've been wanting to get on the trail for the last 6 years, but things always come up that delay my hike. 
I'm currently visiting my parents in Puerto Rico and haven't bought any gear yet. Once I arrive home in Wisconsin at the end of the month, I'll start my purchases. 
I'm currently planning and researching the best gear for me. I'll try to go as ultralight as I can. My physical conditions will benefit with less weight.

Wanderer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553191,"Hi!I haven't set a budget yet, but I have some estimates. Gear usually comes out to $1,000- $2,000.I plan on spending closer than $2,000 since I plan to go ultralight mostly. That will be more beneficial to my body due to my physical conditions;plantar fasciitis, spondylosis, osteoarthritis, and tendonitis. 
I hope to keep my monthly expenses on the trail to under $1,000 a month, including food resupply and hostels on my zero days. I only plan to do a few Mail drops. Some YouTube videos of previous thru-hikers suggest: Neel Gap mm 31.7, N.O.C. mm137.3, Fontana Dam mm 166.3, Bland, VA mm 589.9, Harper's Ferry mm 1023.1, and Monson, ME mm 2074.6.

Wanderer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553430,"Since arriving in Puerto Rico to visit my parents, I've stepped it up a bit. I've been hiking on different types of terrain like sand, in the woods, mangroves and volcanic rock at the beach. Once I get back to Wisconsin, I'll go back to Planet Fitness and hit the local Milwaukee trails.I'm the last 10 days, I've hiked approximately 38 miles, including 2-10 mile days. That is a lot for me lately. After leaving the military I stopped almost all physical training due to injuries and have put on more pounds than desired. My goal now is to get fit and once on the trail, gain more endurance and lose those excess pounds. Bye!",,Getting in shape,"Jan 18, Wed",0
