Been thinking about this trail since 2003, 2008......Did the CT in 2010 instead. I didnt have the nerve to try the AT, barely had it for the Colorado. I more than have it now. I got a few weeks to settle some stuff, if it works out im gonna make a run for it.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Thu",0
Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559725,"Flipped back thru my 2010 CT journal, after re-reading a bunch of those entries, i really over did it with the 'commas'.   So far im still planning to do this, although i wouldnt say i have done much ""planning"". The biggest things learned from CO was you need a smart phone, a guide book, and a credit card. A large bag of foot care products and a hiking partner to shake the tent every morning didnt hurt either. Im 4 out of 5. Joking aside, I do have sort of a planned schedule to get to Damascus VA, couple mail drops, some mileage points, i think that is enough. After that if im still able to continue i will just be winging it.",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Tue",0
Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561597,"Looks like this is gonna happen, the past two weeks really solidified my commitment to give this a shot. Even got some some support from friends and coworkers. My rental property should close first part of next week. In the meantime, been running the dehydrator and making some breakfast bars and some breads. Probably not necessary, but its lightweight, high in protein, calories, and i can vacuum seal all of it for later use. Been trying to take care of some house chores too, got in the crawlspace last night looking for any issues that could be addressed. Everything looked good, repaired some insulation on a few runs of ductwork, but i was really looking for any plumbing issues. Cleaned, organized my yard shed, my van is empty now. Laundry room is straightened out. Ive got some attic insulation to add. That'll be fun.......Started laying out my gear two nights ago. Not much to say on that. Its gone from a pile in my closet to a stack on my guest bed. Wish i had more to say, trying to wrap up some work stuff so im not leaving a mess for anyone. Support from my supervisor has been huge. One look at my financials and utilization, he was almost encouraging a leave of absence. Kidding. I guess i should state my plan. Im gonna try and hike in two phases. The first phase is from GA to Damascus VA, return home for two weeks, and then if im healthy and can make it, feel good about it, return to VA and hike north. I have a prior commitment that i need to keep in June, hence the reason for returning. My leave of absence will cover me for the first phase and my mission trip in June. I really could not have asked for a better situation with work. I can return to work after Salkahatchie, or if im feeling okay, try and make it to Maine. We will just have to see how it goes. Some experience with long distance backpacking, but absolutely none on the AT. The first phase is similar to my hike several years ago in that its about the same length of time and mileage, but vastly different terrain.   So will see.   ",,View Entry,"Apr 25, Tue",0
Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562983,"Still waiting on a closing date, been difficult being patient. Kinda torn between leaving town too early, and waiting it out. I've been ""reassured"" everyday its fine, just waiting on some other document. Really starting to lose it. Closing should have occurred April 21st. I hope to hear today that a firm closing date has been reached and its Monday. I really don't want to throw in the towel, re-list, and start all over. Worried that might be an emotional response not a rational one. The extra time has been productive, getting a ton of stuff done on the house but starting to run out of chores to do. I've made all the dehydrated foods im gonna make, baked all the stuff im gonna bake........ had a killer run on Sunday. Grass is cut, yard shed is cleaned out, finished all the work in the attic. That does look good. Got Jenns car stuff done, tire, oil change, washed. Doing a ton of stuff to prepare for a hike, except actually driving to the trail head.

Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563134,"After losing much sleep over the current state of my house closing, i decided last night to end the agreement with this buyer. It was basically too much over promising and too much under-delivery. With that said, im leaving Monday for the Amicalola Falls. Starting Tuesday morning. Ive wasted enough time dealing with those guys, not wasting any more. Ill relist with another agent, explain the situation, hand her the keys. Certainly not a situation where a huge weight has been lifted, its just what need to be done. I wish every decision suddenly gave you a huge good feeling, but they dont, not ordering ice cream here. This is life. Sometimes you have to give a decision some time to play out. I do feel like a made the right one yesterday. Time will tell.",,View Entry,"May 05, Fri",0

There's three mail drops ready to go out tomorrow. Trying to do a Day 3, Day 6, Day 9 trail stop to get started. Box of food, and some stuff. Jenn hoooked me up with some essential oils. Oils. That are ""essential"" Certainly not one to question their efficacy, not with that classification. Also - been off coffee the past three mornings. Low grade headache every day since. Hopefully resolved by Tuesday morning. That part has been rough. Coffee withdrawal. All my hiking stuff is laid out, i'll cram it in my pack in the morning, save the sleeping bag, then re-pack for that Tuesday morning. The plan is taking the 8 mile approach trail from Amicalola Falls to the start point. Not too nervous, more thinking about how ill probably be home sick. 






I finished all my house chores, even got to run the jon boat down the river to get a bunch of sea foam and non ethanol in it. Its a two stroke. Doing the same with my van as it may be parked awhile. I did find another agent to work with for my house. Had to drop the FSBO option, but i'm fine with it. Shes got the house, and i feel like terminating the previous agreement when i did was a good choice.




There was a saying i heard once, ""everything either falls apart or everything falls into place"" (prior to a hike) Six months, a year ago, i may have said the former. But not now, not at all, a lot of things have really fallen into place.

Forgot my spoon, so i need to figure out a way to eat beans and couscous. Probably just soup it. Few others camped here. Was gonna put my tent up, but this shelter is clean. No cell signal here. 10.5 miles the first day. Weather is phenomenal. Sharpened a flat side on a stick, and used that for a spoon. Really wish i had something to read. Six other people are here at this location. Broke down and had a coffee yesterday. i was ill. No coffee since, and no headaches.

Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564919,"What a day! Blisters are okay, not worse. Got some chaffing though, crotch is tender, mostly inner thighs. Been rinsing my balls and thighs with creek water every chance i get. That helps. Starting to meet some nice people. Two women yesterday somehow had fallen, the bear spray went off, covered both of them. They were in good spirits once they finally made it to the shelter. Chatted with a couple of girls, undergrads from Florida, up for a week. Really interesting. Was gonna snap a photo, but the by the time i thought of that, they were asleep. Would have been awkward. Met a cool couple from Taiwan this afternoon. Her name is ""E"" and her husband is Huey. They're working on their trail names. Long story short, I hope she takes the name Easy E (cause she is slow) and their team name should be TNT (instead of Tbunny and Tturtle). They call me Cray. They are good hikers. The shelter at Gooch Gap was gonna fill up and so were the tent sites. Nice people there but i moved on a couple of miles. Alone in the woods tonite. Hope i don't flip out. Really prefer camping with others. Will hang food tonite. Got a 14 mile day tomorrow to Neels Gap. Bunkhouse, showers, toilets. I can't wait to immerse myself.

Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565225,"Covered 14 miles today. Blood mountain ascent and descent. The downhill was rock hopping for about an hour. Can't believe i didn't roll an ankle. Great day, my crotch is OK. Keeping it cool with water. Keep salty sweet of the chafed areas. Hike with the a wide stance. Blisters are worse. I'm gonna tape them good in morning. Tried some peppermint oil on my thighs and ""that region"" last nite. WOW. Let me tell you - USE SPARINGLY. Like I dropped a bucket of ice down there. My shelter wasn't up 20 minutes before a spider built a web in the top. Then proceeded to catch/kill/eat every gnat in the tent. I released it safely in the morning. Job well done. 
Woke up around 4:15 am cause it was so windy. Thought a storm was coming. I pulled my food bag down and brought it into the tent. Zipped down the flaps. Never rained. Managed to sleep a little better last night. Met one guy on the trail today. A recovering alcoholic whose relapsed too many times. Searching for some kind of enlightenment on the AT now. Said he'd been sober for about two weeks so far. Went on about how drinking ruined his life. I believe him, and i believe he is a nice guy. He was drinking a beer at the hostel today. I hope he can turn it around. Crashed at the Walasi Yi Center. $18 for a shower and a bunk. I showered in my clothes. Then put on my rain gear. 
Walasi Yi Center is a full service outfitter. One of the nicest gear shops I've ever seen. Bought a spoon. Been eating w/ sticks the past two nights. Still haven't found a book to read. I think there's 10 people here? The trail in GA is amazing. The amount of work i've seen put into this trail is amazing. Heavy stones for steps, and edge carved in the side of a mountain for a shelf to walk on, is nothing short of amazing.","Gooch Gap

Rough day, not a lot of miles, but the chaffing is getting managed. Blisters are worse, but not affecting me too much. Down here at Low Gap Shelter. I'm in my tent. Done for the day at 6:15. I couldn't go any further. Leap frogging the past few days with a few guys. They have a group that gets together twice a year. Hunter was a fireman (mid 20's) his dad Chris operated a power plant for a paper mill. Merle was 60. They're steady hikers. Caught some trail magic from Lionheart (Leonard). He was from West Columbia, spent years in Chapin on Lake Murray. His wife passed away four years ago. So he moved up here. He does a lot of section hiking and trail magic (w/shuttles). He told me there's more elevation gain and loss in 79 miles of GA than 500 in VA. That and the approach trail North GA is tough.

Then down, and half way up Tray Mountain, second half, all in the rain - soaked. Felt like John Rambo in First Blood (the first one). Had to keep moving just to stay warm. Met another hiker Dan (aka Blueline) another trail name that makes absolutely no sense.  Cool guy, thoroughly experienced section hiker. Also confirmed the elevation gain/loss in GA versus VA. Talked a good bit about electronics on the trail. Gave me some good pointers. Another guy showed up, he was getting a ride from his dad. He looked 40. One night in and he's already out. 
Not much of a pillow tonight. Wearing my fleece, and my day clothes are wet. 13 miles tomorrow and I'm at Hiawassee. Yes!

Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565250,"Another amazing day. Shoes were soaked from yesterday but seem to be halfway dried out. The hike from Tray Mountain to H town has been good. Some of the views........ Never seen so much woods, its mountains as far as the eye can see. Just ridges and ridges of mountain spine's. Legs are getting stiff. Chafing has subsided. I'm taking a lunch break at Deep Gap shelter. Nice place. Privy, lock box for food storage picnic table. I've got four more miles to do today and i'm overnighting at top of Georgia hiking and hostile center. Shower and bunks. After today, ill have 9 miles to GA/NC border. I've learned about this section. They are:
1. Carry half as much food. Your appetite is not there. Its too physical to eat.
2. It took me seven days to get to the state line, id add zero in there, this has been tough.
3. Skip the approach trail, if you can? What little you have to backtrack from the road to Springer Mtn is NOTHING. The approach trail was not easy. At all.
4. The water sources are pristine, treating with Aqua Mira for now, Leave the heavier filters at home. 
5. Chaffing - keep a wet cool bandana around. Soak it in cold spring water, and wash the sweat off those areas. Every chance you get. Chaffing is caused by sweat crystals?
6. Leki Poles, Leki Poles, Leki Poles! Those sticks have already saved me more than once. Nice being able to use your arms to help you dig in and pull on the up hills.
7. ZERO at the TOG hostel. 1/2 mile to the left (NOBO) Way better than Neels Gap. They are really running that place right.","Tray Mtn

Clay Moore,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565251,"I'm taking my own advice. Taking the day off. Not in any pain, just legs and hamstrings are really stiff. I think the rest might be more than just preventive maintenance. It took me nine hours to cover 13 miles yesterday. Met a couple young hikers at Deep Gap shelters, probably 19? They were smart about their hike, they are trying for Maine. I bet they'll make it. This hostel is nice. Can definitely tell the AT vibe here. Nice managers. $25 a night. 9 AM shuttle to trailhead, 1 PM shuttle to Hiawassee, free coffee, showers, the extras are reasonably priced. I do not feel like hiking today. At all.
There are some characters here. One guy will not stop talking – to anybody! His trail name is ""Doc"", so of course you can bet he is no actual doctor. If he were, he probably only see two patients a day. And what is it with hikers and acoustic guitars? I'm still glad i'm zeroing here. (Now that dude Doc is asking the owner to make change for $100!). He's monopolizing each individual staff member with his requests. Now he wants to buy a bumper sticker! Really impressed with the staff here at TOG. This place is first class, really noticing the small things they do.

My hamstrings feel like stiff thick round ropes up the backs of my legs. I heard a commotion over my left shoulder, looked down hill and saw two black bears running. They were not interested in me at all. Two guys at the hostel. Jesse and Joel from Austin Texas out for a month. Intelligently funny. Former through hiker from last year also was there. Hiking again. Great advice from him. Stopping for dinner earlier was the way to go. Got to a remote campsite here and all i had to do was set the tent up. And hang my food. Very easy. Now i'm flat on my back. Not moving for the next 11 hours. What's funny is i'm trying to relax and there's a fly and a huge bumblebee really working the outside of my tent.

You have a certain number of miles to do, whether you can do them by 4 PM or 6 PM. You have all the small things to do also. Get water, lunches, bathroom breaks..... Drink water, check your locations. And then you have the stuff that does not help, impedes your progress, blisters, bugs, blowdown's, heat, chafing...... At the end of the day you have to have done your miles. I'm 1.2 short today. I'm feeling rough. No pain yet. Just major stiffness and some tenderness on my left knee. Met a guy today, he's 72 now but thru hiked when he was 60. Fun fact about that age group, 95% success rate. Reason is there mentally tough. A bad day on the trail is nothing like a bad day in the real world. Something they spent the past 40 years in. Success rate of the 20-year-old's, 20%. I cannot seem to break the 14 mile mark.

My knee felt good and the trail just seemed easier. Maybe? Still mountains. But NC seems to be more valleys and forest. GA seemed to be a green jungle. GA was tough. Made two climbs today, Albert mountain with its fire tower was tough but worth it. Met another guy yesterday, caught up with him today, trail name Mad Dog (Justin Schroeder twin brother) He was a college professor out for a week. Young guy. Man could he hike though. Fast. Ex soccer player, had a Charlottesville half marathon T-shirt on. A lot of these quiet dudes, these extreme sports guys seem to earn those nicknames. He was cool. So far my plan lately is to hit a shelter at 3 to 4 o'clock. Cook dinner, clean up, get 2 L of water, and get down the trail till about six or so. This puts me way away from everybody else. Tenting in a remote quiet location. With all my chores already done, i'm just setting the tent up and hanging my food bag. Doing this also puts me in a good position to sometimes hit the next shelter around 9 AM for breakfast. Passed the 100 mile mark today. My body is still reacting.

I camped up on the ridge, went down to the shelter to regroup, get a snack, and then hit the trail. It was raining pretty good. About 7:55 AM. I was excited, ready to attack the trail, i really was. However, not wanting to set my wet food bag down the dry shelter floor i hung
it on a nail behind me. Well in my haste and because i packed my gear a little differently because of the rain, i just missed it. I didn't realize my mistake until i got 5 miles down the trail. Aaagh!!! My stomach just dropped. I couldn't believe it. What could I do? Go back 5 miles then remake the 5 miles, then do 7 to get to the NOC. Make it a 22 mile day, or sleep in the woods a second nite? I had a shuttle appointment there already and i have to be in Columbia at 3 PM tomorrow. I couldn't go back. The sad part is, in my food bag was my headlamp, stove, cookpot, multivitamins, toothbrush, toothpaste, that dern spoon i bought in Neels Gap. I was ill. Ive had that head lamp and cook set since my late 20's. Maybe somebody will bring it down the mountain? No idea. One of the biggest hiking mistakes i've ever made. Worst of all you don't leave food and gear at a shelter for other people to deal with, secondly on my way out i retrieved another person's food bag for him (the German) so he could stay warm and dry in his tent, set up inside the shelter....... then i left mine. I was so mad i did 12 miles in the pouring rain in six hours with nothing but a piece of bread for breakfast. One of those days...... Back in Franklin tonight. Rental car back to Columbia tomorrow.

Ultimately, the buyer could not get financing and i basically had to ask for a release. Drop the FSBO status and list with an agent. The first deal was a mess. I lost a lot of sleep over it. I spent a lot of time in prayer during it and especially the last week. I just couldn't understand how this deal was going so horribly. A lot of petitions went up, let me tell you. There were some relief when the deal was ended and i restarted with this new agent. But there was a lot of heartache, stress, disbelief, confusion...... I just didn't understand how this first deal could or would not go thru. I'll be honest i never thought this buyer was the best person for this house. He wanted a deal and did not mind asking for everything and then some. Really ran me through the ringer. And being FSBO, i was representing myself, so some of it may have just been my inexperience. To sum it up, two days after i had been on the trail i got a text from the new agent. She had an offer on the house who subsequently turned out to be a cash buyer. No financing problems there. The house closed seven business days later (yesterday). I walked away with a substantial amount more than i would've made on the first deal and this buyer wanted a home, not an investment property, she was a very nice lady. I'm so glad she got the house.

Seven hikers passed me, i passed one. She's at the same shelter now. I just did not feel like hiking today. Good start at 7:30, crossed the dam, then hated every minute of it. Not the best intro into the Smokies. However, did see one deer, very tame, within 15 feet, i think. Had a headache all day. Got to the first shelter, saw Chief here. It was good to see him. I borrowed an ibuprofen.  It helped. I just wasn't feeling it today.  I was glad to make it here. Three miles short of my goal but I don't care. I'll make it up tomorrow.

Actually a really cool, dynamic group. Probably six women, seven guys. Decent weather today, but always wet. Either from sweat or rain, but always damp. Today was definitely better than yesterday.  And actually my biggest mile day but only because yesterday was so low. Start time was 8 AM finished at 6:45 PM. Started out with Bubbles, but she fell back after the first shelter. She was cool, graduate degree in accounting. Stopped at a shelter for lunch (Derek Knob) bunch of chipmunks running around. I shared a few bits of pop tarts with one. Something about a couple stripes and a tail with hair. Makes all the difference. Got some decent views. Been at 5000 feet probably all day. Chafing is back. Eh. So far this is been the toughest thing I've ever done. Mentally and physically, very tough. Dylan and Claire are here. Ran into them several days ago. Bunch of dudes here tonight. They have a fire going in the fireplace.  Way cool. Had my first Mountain House meal tonight ""Chili Mac with Beef"". Awesome. Got to experience some of the ""smoky mountains"" visibility 50 feet or so.  This hike, this trail right through the middle of the Smokies, is tough. Hard to enjoy, part of the reason i stayed short yesterday, was because Chief was there. Something about calm, caring, capable, informative men that i really like. Like to talk with him. Maybe it's his age, 76 he knew a lot. And being around in the past few days really helped my confidence. He answered all my dumb questions. We also talked about divorce a little. He shook my hand this morning. Went out of his way to do so before we parted. He's part of that generation where a handshake means something.

It's because i haven't been cleaning my feet every day like i should. Both feet have a fungus on the underneath side of my toes at the base. The skin is starting to break down. My fault. My cardinal rule - take care of your feet!! and i was not doing it. Just ill about it. Preventable. One foot smells worse than the other and when Jen smelled my shoe, she abruptly turned away, went between two cars like about to throw up. She didn't. Thankfully. I carried my shoes into the outfitters to find some insoles. 10 minutes later someone lit incense stick. My feet are in bad shape. My legs and knees are good. My feet are not. Seriously do not know if I'm hiking tomorrow. This is not cool. I met a southbound hiker two days ago coming from Harpers Ferry some 800 miles or so from here. He made a good comment ""don't assume it's supposed to hurt because you're hiking"" Yes it is going to be some discomfort but get the problem resolved. He lost some time, about a week because his shoes were not fitting. I just assumed my feet hurt because of the miles are the terrain, it was fungus. It was because i was not washing them every night. Simply changing to dry socks is not enough.  Jenn spent most of the day helping me get my foot issues resolved. Popping blisters and applying oil's and fungicides to my feet. Spent at least two hours with my feet in a hot Epsom salt bath. I do not think i'll be able to hike tomorrow. This is not cool.

It was explained in an interview with Baltimore Jack that an online journal ceases to be completely honest when written for an audience.  While i certainly haven't or wouldn't air every little secret, i did try to be honest about what was going on..... As it has been said before, Nobody hikes alone"" i did not  make it to Millinocket purely under my own guidance.  I need to thank the Lord first for the re-route in my life March 16, 2016. I think, i know, there was some protective boundary placed around me while i hiked.  I was way too fortunate, too well protected this entire hike.  Many thanks to those who helped me along the way.  I had a good supervisor at work, Fred.  A lot of respect for him.  Special thanks to Kayli ""Bubbles"" and Brian ""Shaggy"" Slack.  A great time if we could hike again.   Thank you both.
The AT is work.  After awhile, it stops being ""another amazing day hiking"" and it turns into simply getting mileage.  If your long term goal is not Katahdin and that dern sign, forget about it.  The good thing about it is that if you are a worker, someone who has punched a clock before, you will do fine on the AT.  It is a job for six months.  And when it totally feels like a dam job just remember it started as your dream.   That is the only common denominator i could see, you have to be a worker, a non quitter. Basically someone that is willing to keep going. 
Dont wait until the perfect time to hike.  I waited possibly 12, 13 years for the perfect time to hike, and probably a little for the confidence to do so.  But i met people who had been thinking of a thru hike for just a year, and read plaques to people who dreamed of hiking it for 40 years.  Don't wait.  There will never be a perfect time to take 5, 6 months off from work, family and do something like this.  As soon as you think you might have things close enough, go for it, take a chance.  Don wait, or you will end up waiting and waiting and waiting........ 
Do not hike on a budget.  If there is one thing you can control on this hike, its how much money you plan to start with.  After that, there is very little control left up to you.  I would guess that i spent $6000 on this hike.  But keep in mind, this is a six month vacation.  So save up.  Thru hiking is very difficult, and if you want off the trail for a nite to get a shower, some laundry done, a pizza, some ice cream..... you need to take those breaks, you need those allowances.  The last thing you want to worry about is ""can i afford a town stop"" ?  What kept me going were those breaks.  (Make sure any location that provides a wire transfer via Western Union can also cash that check)   
Get in the best shape you can prior to hiking.  The start of the hike is really tough.  Im not sure if its the trail, although GA is rough, i think its because 30 minutes on a stairmaster three times a week can not prepare for you for 10 hours a day six days a week.  Nothing can.  However, the better shape you are in will help your body handle this inital shock much better.  Start slow!  Do not worry about schedule, mileage, your pace until the VA border?  The last thing you want to do is injure out.  
Hike your own hike (HYOH) or at least try.  You are gonna meet faster hikers that seem to just blow right by.  I can think of a couple hikers that were much faster, one did not finish, and i don't think the other did either, unless he flipped?  Both were great hikers.  But we all have different circumstances to deal with.  Stay the course.  Remember, not only did the turtle finish the race, he actually won it.  Do your best to not get caught up with who is hiking when or where and you do whats comfortable for you.  The couple times i violated this policy i knew it.  
Hiking the AT is hardcore.  It is work, but it is rewarding.  Extremely.  Every morning when you go to work, put a pack on.  That is your work day.  Get ready for work in the morning, get ready for camp each nite.   It can be cool. And boring too.  But when its not, its exciting. and its amazing what you find yourself accomplishing.  Everyday is full of optimism.  Everyday is a mystery as to what tomorrow will bring.  Its a long working vacation.  It still kinda blows my mind a little bit when i recall how intense that life was for a 154 days.     
The AT is a big part of peoples lives for a time, and then its not.  And that's okay.  This was a dream of mine for years.  I am glad i was able to finally get a chance to make it to Springer Mtn in GA and go for it.  Maybe i can finally close this chapter.  ",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Mon",0
